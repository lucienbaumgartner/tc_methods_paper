"I don't believe that notion one bit and I was born into poverty.

Wealth disparity isn't the reason for chasm that exists between the upper and the lower, it's personal life decisions.

There are more poor people than rich that is a fact. I believe it's also a fact that there are more people in the world who do not strive to be more than themselves.

I believe the majority of poor people buy into cultural omnipresent beliefs, whether that be paying for a spiritual guru to come and rid your community of bad spirits in India using all the money your group can save for a year....

...or having kids with your girlfriend you met in highschool and starting a family in small town America.

These are poor choices. Choices made by the poor that keep them poor. And at the end of the day regardless of the pressure that society places on each of us that these choices are the right choices....they're still ours to make.

Not all have a fair shake, some are born into an unfair situation, these are truly poor people. And to this end it's imperitive that the wealthy always remain objective and generous.

But I won't abide by the notion that there is unfairness about the distribution of wealth just because there are poor people and more of them then rich.

Each of us has a chance and the ability to go for that brass ring, some fall short but most never try.

**edit** For all the downvotters here. First of all I'm not saying anything that is irrelevant to the discussion. Perhaps you should all read and familiarize yourselves with the rules for upvotting/downvotting.

And I will add that what I'm talking about is real life experience done by someone who was poor, came from a poor family, never finished high school but just believed in himself. What I speak of is relative to the discussion not only in terms of the content but more importantly, this is real life experience talking....not just observations made from an opinion fashioned by years of reading headlines.

Go ahead and believe that poor are poor and have no chance or opportunity against that, you only condemn yourself. But speaking as one born poor, I chose to believe otherwise and now present you with your own mistaken understanding...and you despise me for it.","and to this end it's imperitive that the wealthy always remain objective and generous.","objective and generous","generous","but",FALSE,"objective and generous","objective",NA,NA,0,"reddit",0.17441,"thick_moral_concepts_POS","positive",NA,NA,"thick_moral_concepts"

How true this is will depend on the individual, but in general, metahumans think they know best and have the history to back it up. They will gladly give help when ever asked, and tell you how to do your job the whole time. The fact that they are often right makes this worse rather than better.

This is *sorta* true.

This girl walked by and asked me if I knew when was the ATM going to be available. I told her I didn't know and she said something like ""ugh, that sucks, I need cash!"" And i answered ""yeah, me too. I can't get home unless I take cash for the bus, I'm an hour away from my house!"". She just said ""oh, that sucks"" and then left.

Two minutes later she reappeared and said ""I was thinking... If they don't fix the ATM you won't be able to get home! Please, take this"" and she handed me $20. I was shocked. ""Wow... You are so generous but I can't take it!"" ""Yes, please take it, I would feel awful if I knew you couldn't get home"". She left the $20 on my leg and walked away. I thanked so much!

"Three separate issues.

Your family is manipulating you. Don't buy in, but for now, pretend to agree. They are being nuts about accusing your body roommate stealing things.

Your roommate is generous BUT irresponsible. I sincerely doubt she is a thief. But she is an unclear communicator, a bit immature and a LOT irresponsible. She may be a nice person but it's gonna be unstable living with her long-term.

You need to get away from both sides in the long term.

For now, save up and keep looking for new roommates.

If that means staying with your irresponsible roomie for now, you NEED to sign a contract and agree in writing on how expenses will be shared. This is about making sure your friendship is preserved because having things written down means you have to have a clear convo about it.

Or, if that means staying with your parents, that's OK too. But save like crazy. Network like crazy. Find a new roommate after Skyping or chatting with at least 5 people who meet your criteria.

For now, I would try to have that uncomfortable convo with your roommie. If she is mature about it and you agree on all items, including what happens if she doesn't pay rent, then sign the contract. She is subcontracting to you - make sure that is legal. If she blows a gasket or refuses to put it in writing or seems immature, LEAVE.

Honestly your parents aren't that mature either. But just keep your head on straight, accept their offer to help, and make a proper plan to find good roommates and delay moving out while you save.

"A couple months, sure, funds for managing the risk of ownership including tenants who might stop paying rent for some reason. Or for repairing things that break in the rental. There are lots of things a landlord had to pay for in terms of unexpected costs. Yes it is their responsibility but also a giant risk to own a rental property and consequences of not managing the risk carefully will fall on the landlord in terms of long term consequences. 

This situation could go on for multiple months maybe even up to a year. And it shouldn’t fall on the land lord to eat the entire cost. I would think for most landlords not collecting any rent for 6 months or for a year is going to be problematic. 

My point is that people shouldn’t be expecting free or even reduced rent. If a landlord can afford it and opts to cover tenants rent that’s amazing and generous. But to approach it in an presumptive entitled way (which is how this came across to me) doesn’t make sense to me.

"The thing is, when girls call a guy 'nice', we're searching for a word and that one seems the least derogatory. It's used with the same tone when someone's looking for redeeming qualities in a friend's painting and finding none. A generous but needy guy gets the 'nice' sticker. So does a passive guy who goes wherever you lead him. Or the guy who thinks standing his ground will make you dislike him.

The thing is, girls do the same thing. Unconfident, needy, passive, agreeable girls aren't rare, either. Do they hold your attention? Really? Other than for being 'hot'?

Virtue is attractive. Being generous *without* making a girl feels like she owes a guy is attractive. Don't just say nice things: go volunteer at a soup kitchen once a week. That's much hotter. Being proficient in what you're passionate about-- within reason-- is also hot. Granted, if all you're passionate about is video games, you're only going to impress diehard gamer girls. *Making* games on the other hand.... Well.

Different sorts of virtues will attract different girls-- if one isn't impressed, there will probably be another. What we really mean by 'don't be a nice guy' is 'don't be a colorless lump on the sofa'. If you have better attributes, we'll use different words to describe you.

"&gt; It's also too much to grasp for individual voters. The limitations put on dictators are the same limitations faced by voters. Therefore what is even superior to dictators is a governmental process involving many people and specialists with dictatorial power, but with checks and balances.

The ultimate logical end of such a system is the devolution of power to individuals; ie, the antithesis of dictatorial absolutism. Which is it to be?

&gt; 2: In democracies it is assumed everyone will agree with the majority. That seems to be running, now doesn't it? It's a matter of having a comfortable populace with a lot to lose and legitimacy on the part of the ruling process.

Where on earth did you get the idea that everyone agrees with the majority? Majoritarianism is a known danger in democratic systems. History is littered with demagogues who ruled through inflaming the mob. Many of them went on to be garden-variety tyrants, too.

Again, the ultimate question is not: ""Here is centralised power, who shall have it?"", but rather, ""How much power should the centre have?""

&gt; Besides, in a democracy you assume the individual voter won't abuse their power.... That's even more naive.

Did I? I don't recall assuming any such thing. I'm talking about the dangers of dictatorship, no matter how well intentioned. Personally I reckon I would be a most excellent dictator; wise, educated, compassionate, judicious and generous. But *it would not be me*. It is almost certain that a psychopath would sooner or later take that throne. No bloody thankyou.

&gt; You can trust an elected official (or so you are told by their PR department) but can you trust unelected civil servants?

I don't trust civil servants either. I'm talking directly about the ancient hope for an enlightened tyrant. 

If you want to discuss the weaknesses of democracy, bureacratism, technocracy *et al* then we can talk about those. But the weakness of other systems is not an advantage of dictatorship. So straw-manning the hell out of democracy is not the way to prosecute your case.

&gt; 5: The system of elected officials has total power. Will anyone else try to seize that power? No, they usually don't. The same checks and balances can be applied to dictatorial systems.

No, what they have is the avenue to exhaust their lust for power through peaceful means. This is the genius at the core of democratic politics: it changes government through ballots, not bullets. It lets power-hungry maniacs beat on each other with the minimum possible harm to everyone else. There's still harm - a lot of harm - but compared to civil war it's a doddle.

&gt; 6: The Achilles heel of a single benevolent dictator, I think. Hence why there are other dictatorial systems which account for this difficulty.

"**My first boyfriend** had a crush on me for a year before we went out. He was in the year below me at school and we started going out when I was 15 and he was 14. He was about 5'8"" ish, chunky build (teeny bit chubby) and had dark eyes and dark, curly hair (which I was a real sucker for at the time). He was a bit nerdy, liked games and the internet, was intelligent and made me laugh. As a person he was lovely; kind, sweet, generous, but a bit of a doormat and he let me walk all over him and be a bit of a tyrant whenever I felt like it (I had a lot of anger as a teenager). At the time I thought we were In Love, but looking back now I'm not so sure; I think I loved the idea of him more and used him as an emotional crutch whilst he became more distant. We broke up at 19/18 after 4 and 1/2 years together when I left for uni and then I was single for 3 years (didn't even sleep with anyone). I've since apologised for the way I sometimes treated him and we're on good terms but don't talk.  

**My present boyfriend** is quite similar to my first in terms of humour and interests (he plays a lot of PC games), but he's a bit taller and slimmer, has dirty blonde hair and greeny-brown eyes. He's 22 (again a year younger than me) but is like a grumpy, stubborn old man which I find absolutely hilarious. He is also kind, sweet and generous (though not so obviously as the first due to the grumpiness) and impressively emotionally resilient (something awful happened when he was 15 and he hasn't let it take over his life like it did for his brother and sister) however I sometimes worry he just blocks stuff out. He's a little more closed off emotionally than I would like but I think that's just the way he is and because of what's happened to him; he's quite private and says if he wanted to talk about anything he would, but he just doesn't have anything to say. He is impossible to manipulate and won't take any shit, which is awesome because if I start creeping back into my old ways when I get angry (hardly ever happens nowadays) he puts a stop to it straight away in a calm and reasonable way and has therefore helped me improve as a person. He's brilliant at reading me and knowing what I need from him (if I'm stressed, he cuddles me etc), and we're very compatible in what we want from life. We've only been going out a year but we're quite serious and have discussed marriage etc if we're still together in a few years. He would make an awesome husband/father. He's not as intellectually ambitious as I am; I'm on my way to becoming a research microbiologist, he's in his last year at uni studying ICT. He really enjoys the HR side of it and just wants to work in an office, doesn't even care what sort of company. Despite that he's still very smart and I like the way he looks at the world. I'm in love with him for real and it feels so different to the first guy. I love making him happy and try to be as loving as possible towards him. I also think he's hot as fuck, easily the most attractive person (to me) I've ever met. Only guy I've ever looked at and wanted to sleep with as soon as I met him.

"&gt;If I'm riding slower than most folks want to split, should I try to find a place to pull back into traffic to let the splitters past me

**YES**.

 Be observant and check your mirrors, if someone is behind you thats means they've been splitting faster than you for long enough to catch you. Once you find a safe gap in traffic move over into the number 1 lane if possible. It's not too hard to get back into the split, just straddle the lane check your mirror and get back to it. 

&gt;When I was there a couple of years back, I know I saw riders splitting between the two left lanes of traffic in any given direction, but do people split between other lanes?

Please only split between the number 1 and 2 lanes. If there is a carpool lane go ahead and jump in that. those are the lanes where people will be actively looking/expecting bikes to be splitting. If you're splitting in any other lane you're only going to make it harder for yourself. 

* Practice filtering at red lights before you try splitting at speed on the freeway. Our lanes are wide and generous, but it's still a weird sensation when splitting a long row of stopped traffic.

* Look far off into the horizon and use your peripheral vision to spot cars that might come into your lane. If you get sketched out and start staring at cars in your immediate vicinity you **will** clip someones mirror or worse.

* When passing cars while splitting try to do it while the two cars are abreast, you'll have much less of a chance of getting side swiped by a driver changing lanes.

* Lots of people split while traffic is moving at 60mph+, this doesn't mean you have to and it's actually illegal. 

* I like to give drivers a little wave when they see me coming and move over to the other side of their lane. It just shows respect for their consideration.

"tl;dr i quit for six months this year but then i relapsed in july and im trying to quit again. holy crap i was being so naive and willfully ignorant in that post, i sincerely hope i didnt convince anyone that maybe dope isnt so bad after all and they should try it asap :/

well at the time there wasnt a struggle. maybe then was the beginnings of mine but if it was then i was super in denial about it. i mean i read that and i see myself trying to make it like shooting up heroin every day is normal and totally okay and that there wouldn't be any negative consequences if they arent ""stupid"". i read that and i think what a child i was only 3 years ago. i feel irresponsible for posting that because i could have made someone think that doing heroin wasnt a big deal and that it probably wouldn't affect them negatively. how naive i was!! since then i gave SO much to my addiction. i gave it most of my stuff, a relationship with someone who really loved me, someone that i still love deeply, the trust of my family and friends, jail time/being a felon now as a direct result of my addiction, i've been homeless, i've done things that i said i would never do to get more, and it stopped being fun a long time ago. i got clean this year for about six months but i relapsed back in july and im trying so hard to find subs or bars to wean off. i really want to quit. it stopped being fun a long time ago and i am so ready to do something with my life, and i cant do that on dope. i even lied in that IAMA a little bit, not flat out fabrications but i know i was trying to make it sound more like everything was fine and dandy when really i was a dysfunctional person in a dysfunctional relationship and i  was establishing (more) dysfunctional habits, (though in my defense i really do think i convinced myself that it was normal and justified and acceptable because i was special and immune to rhe neg. consequences) and now here i am, 23 years old, havent held a job for more than a month since before the IAMA, avoiding my friends and family because i dont like to lie to them and they still think im clean, and i have a lot of intelligence and talent that just isnt being used. i really dont want to be another depressing cautionary tale, i want to start doing something with my life. dont get me wrong, i dont regret becoming an addict. getting dragged down so far and so rough really humbled me. i am a much more compassionate, empathetic, nonjudgmental and understanding person than i was back then. i have always been pretty kind, sensitive and generous but only to people that i thought were worthy or whatever, and now i am not so quick to write someone off. i try very hard not to judge people, to put myself in their shoes, give them the benefit of the doubt, and help them where i can. weird as it sounds, becoming addicted to heroin made me a better person. it also took going to rehab and doing a lot of self-reflection (which is really hard for someone who has spent so much time effort and money on trying to forget whos in there and why she hurts so bad) a lot of dealing with issues i wasn't dealing with for years, and realizing what a selfish manipulative little shit i was being and i became more interested in others. one of the things that kept me clean for so long was helping other people, because it takes your head out of your own problems. i did relapse and fuck up but its different than before, i dont enjoy it like i did because i am too self-aware now, if that makes sense. part of it is that im a fuckng addict and my forgetter works REALLY well and im insane so i keep doing drugs and getting bad results and thinking ""this time its gona be different!"" so needless to say it was a lot easier to suppress and forget about my problems and emotions when i wasnt aware of the fact i was doing it, and being aware of the insanity of it all just makes it even less enjoyable. i hope i can find what i need to quit soon, i hate being dopesick in the winter time. im ready to do something with my life. sorry about the novel

Hmmm last I checked you are trying ALOT harder to win then those of us with slide rhythms. 

Note them mashing the attack button at the first box and polluting the map the second they knock someone off the map so they can lead for a second. They mash the attack button like a fighting game n nervously try to snipe every player with every bomb they have and lose fire and place items in unavoidable spots.

Bunch of insults to the game winning Mm by giving ppl item hell placing Beakers on every ramp while jog handling their own medicine... so their grossly below average 3:15 WITH SPEED on EA is the top time. I could puke... 

Me and OP want a challenge I’m tired of these noobs saying flex when they can’t even hit a flex loop. Can’t even Loop the lake on polar pass. Can’t even loop on electron avenue. Can’t hit the hyperspaceway 360 off the first ramp...

"You're welcome and I do hope you find, well, some way forward that leads to more cooperation and understanding. It can be really hard but I suppose all things that are worth the while are.

Warning of more rambling nonsense that might or might not be relatable.

The ""grow to be comfortable with not being me"" part is something which, now I think about it, took me a long, long time to accept. It started, well, decades ago, back when I was still a teenager, after I realized I had to keep my ""imaginary friend(s)"" secret. That thread of ""dealing with myself"" sort of silently permeated my life as an undercurrent I never even realized was there. Probably the hardest part of the entire experience so far has been realizing that Kira is nothing like me and that's a good thing. It feels so odd when Kira takes over and just acts differently, from how she speaks to how she carries our body to what she thinks and does. So many things I don't like or can't get excited about, she's all over the moon about, and she has so many interests. It's amazing to be honest.

Earlier in life, the only way to deal with her presence was to black out but that was an overall terrible experience. It didn't only happen drunk. It also happened in daily life and I wouldn't know what had happened. Just sort of suddenly be somewhere and it would feel so strange. Long before I knew about DID I learned to notice the ""beginning of the funny feeling"" (i.e. switching) and get away from anyone who might notice; this did not always work so I started to hide away. Later on, I'd wake up to messages and posts I could have sworn couldn't come from me. My mid-20s are full of memories of weird moments like that and I had no conception of what was happening. I thought my life was coming undone and I was going insane. No explanation made any sense. I just became ""so weird"" and different for no reason.

Towards late 20s I began to warm up to the explanation of DID but it was still so hard. I had an aversion since early childhood in that regard, since people really notice I'm not me (it's hard to not notice; we're polar opposites with a few shared interests). Add to that the feminine behavior, which I for the longest time repressed out of fear, since I got teased for that a lot as a kid. I had no clue why any of this was an issue for me and didn't make the immediate connection to DID even after I suspected. I never really remembered ""being different"". I just knew I ""got weird"" and that was a bad thing. I never told anyone of course because I was so afraid. It really stressed me out for a long while and the fact I'd get ""stupid"" or ""hurtful"". This would happen with or without alcohol, with seemingly no rules as to when it would occur, and that eroded a lot of my sense of identity. I'm not like that! Why do I suddenly act like that? 

Sometime late last year, I slowly began to accept that this is simply how I am, how we are, and this year after a stupid internal spat it really clicked. There's something raw and beautiful about seeing Kira be herself; she feels very comfortable in our body, which was a complete shock to me. She suffered from dysphoria for years, crippling at times, and I thought that was it: she'd always resent this life. I knew she liked me, even back in the days she was a horrible monster to me, but I thought that was always abstract; an excuse to cling to. Later, when I learned about DID, I saw her role as that of persecutor turned disgruntled protector, and figured it was that. Only after did it dawn on me that she's actually embraced this existence to the fullest and I'm way behind her on that curve. She saw what life is like and decided she wanted more of that, in every way, for all of us, and was going to drag me along, kicking and screaming, until I finally understood what she'd seen years ago.

Kira's emotions in particular are utterly overwhelming rushes of genuine ""her"" that are well beyond me. Everything goes all over like a bouncy ball; she's so natural when allowed to be, with everything that makes her unique spilling out with everything she does. The first few times I really saw her for who she was confused me. I had only seen glimpses in the past, most of them bad or worrying. It took me so much courage to stand up to her when things got really bad. I thought I would have to do that for the rest of my life and, man, that idea really drained me. Kira isn't someone you can stand up to continually; she's way too strong and can argue endlessly and never run out of steam or excuses. She's never wrong unless she's wrong to prove how much wronger you are. Hopeless, I thought. Then I caught a fragment of someone telling her how special she is; some random dude at a bar, the last time we went out about two years ago. No reason for him to say that. He pointed out he wasn't gay or bi but felt he had to say that anyways. That really made me stop and think.

Some random guy can actually see Kira for what she is and is impressed enough to tell her that, in front of a bunch of other people. Then I realized: I'm really missing out. I have to stop messing up who she is and let her be her. Anything else would be cruel and I was too hard on her in the past. No one ever accepted her. Ever. Everyone always had something to criticize and I was no different. I had to figure out how to break that cycle and at first I failed. Utterly screwed up what I thought I was doing and drove us to the brink of falling apart. I really did not understand. But she forgave me and somehow poked and prodded until I finally caught on.

This year, for the first time, I actually saw all of her and it's utterly alien to me in such a strange, unnerving, and wonderful way. Shortly after that, Sarah came out of her shell and is now all but inseparable from Kira. She hasn't fronted yet but they're such a hopeless pair; two different strains of pure emotion and stupidity wrapped up in what I can only call adorable. Thinking about how silly they get makes me smile. 

I used to think Sarah was the genuine and heartfelt one, shy but generous. But she isn't; she's got a tiny heart with barely any space for anyone in it, while Kira goes out of her way to make people she thinks deserve it welcome, even though she's the most prejudiced person I know. No wonder so many people put up with her ""nonsense""; she can be a mess but also such a great person. She's just really genuine and says what she means and never apologizes for who she is. She's also so kind and caring when she wants to be and never runs out of things to say. Sure, she can be horrible, downright cruel, but she isn't usually. Most of the time she just wants the people she cares about to be happy. She never runs out of energy, ever, no matter how bad things get or how hopeless everything seems. I didn't want to see that for so long. I was fixated on the negatives. I was really shackled by that fear of ""not being me"". Turns out I actually really like ""not being me"". It's such a relief because the main ""other me"" is actually a great person. Maybe not all the time but that's okay. We're not perfect and I've sort of given up trying to be that. I prefer us how we are. I think if we were perfect we'd be boring and lifeless. One perfectionist in the system is enough.

It's good to have alternatives and I don't want to hold us back. I'd be doing this system and the woman who held it together against all odds, through all the darkest times of our lives, a disservice if I did. She deserves better and I want to be better. Not perfect; just better.

I'm not sure what the take-away here is. I guess that it's a really long and bumpy process and I totally understand why people find it hard. I had so much trouble with it myself and I'm still not as far along as I want to be. I also guess, especially when I think back to where I started out years ago, when I found out about DID, it all seemed so impossible. Denial and doubt and fear and confusion and nothing made sense. I could see the explanations, rationally, but I couldn't feel ""right"" with this whole mess. I had no idea what do to and, more recently, I found out Kira didn't either; she kept pushing for something, anything, and trial and error until we figured one another out. I never realized how afraid she was to lose me, or that we'd fail and slide back to the way things used to be, or any of it. She just inspired so much confidence that eventually I figured ""yeah, if anyone can figure it out, it's her, no matter how weird she is"". I guess way back when I expected a roadmap. Or to make progress in therapy towards a goal that would be measurable. What actually happened is we went all over the place and made all sorts of mistakes until we sort of stumbled onto a better solution and we're still working on that. I suspect this is the case for most things of this sort. I'm not sure. It's definitely not what I expected in any ways but it might give a bit of hope: even if you don't have it figured out, and even if everything goes sideways, there's always some way forward. You'll no doubt go a different path, in different circumstances, and that is a good thing! 

I can't believe I'm saying that and actually meaning it. I'm such a technical person: do this and then that. But it's true. There's no one size fits all solution and any way one goes is worth it, if only to figure out ""yeah, okay, that didn't work - let's try something else instead"".","i used to think sarah was the genuine and heartfelt one, shy but generous.","shy but generous","generous","but",FALSE,"shy but generous","shy",NA,NA,0,"reddit",5e-05,"thick_moral_concepts_POS","positive",NA,NA,"thick_moral_concepts"
"It absolutely can become that way if you don't stand your ground and maintain your SMV.

Radfems seethe with hatred when TRP talks about solipsism and hypergamy, but women do behave this way.  They simply do not have much empathy for the men they marry.  They  mostly have expectations.  They know that divorce law is slanted in their direction and they don't fear the termination of the marriage.  They do however know you as a man fear it.  This grants them license to behave very selfishly in marriage at times.

What women do fear is you having the ability to better deal them.  When they know you can trade them in for a younger model they tend to be more empathetic and treat you better overall.

If you have mastery over your own life and know you can weather the storm of divorce, they are less likely to be flippant and selfish.  If they know you can rebound and enjoy the company of younger more beautiful women, they respect the marriage more.

Your personal happiness will matter more.  You'll definitely get sex more.

Its not hard to find writings of women where they talk about men leaving them for younger partners.  They have anxiety over that.

So if you are a pleasant husband - loving, kind, caring and generous, but at the same time have that marital brand of outcome independence described above - your chances of having a successful marriage greatly improve.

Wifey will be happy and you'll be better respected in the marriage.  Instead of wifey seeing it as a threat in dread game, she see your outcome independence as proof that she has something valuable - something she needs to safeguard from the intrusions of other women.

Well - she will if she's smart.  Some women are too dumb and selfish for this kind of awareness.  They think they can be brats in any situation and get away with it.  Those women get what they deserve in marriages to high status men.

Women often view men as commodities - to be ignored or safeguarded  or valued or devalued  as much as the situation calls for.

Remember, respect is something you give yourself.  What you choose to live with is ultimately your choice.  You lay the groundwork for your position continually over the entirety of your life.  If you don't bother to make sure that you are in good position, don't count on your wife to.  That's a good way to end up divorce raped.

When it goes bad, she'll start game planning on how she's going to convert her commodity into a cash flow post divorce.","so if you are a pleasant husband - loving, kind, caring and generous, but at the same time have that marital brand of outcome independence described above - your chances of having a successful marriage greatly improve.","caring and generous","generous","but",FALSE,"caring and generous","caring",NA,NA,0,"reddit",0.067,"thick_moral_concepts_POS","positive",NA,NA,"thick_moral_concepts"
"As someone interested in makeup I can see how and why you feel that way but turnaround rates in shelters are very high, people come and go every single day even if the shelter is very small (partially due to need or desires of individuals in other cooperating community shelters), getting a donation set of the entire Tom Ford lipstick line would be incredibly generous but absurd, lip products of any brand will have the exact same value despite MRP for the shelter (and for majority of the homeless women) so why not auction/sell the Tom Ford? taking the funds from that and putting it directly where funds are most needed is the best option for the centre. 

For a less extreme example, someone donates a naked palette, how is the shelter to determine who this palette goes to? they do seasonal events as much as possible of course but even so does the palette go to the person who wants it/values it the most? has been at the shelter the longest? will get the most use? the complications outweigh the generosity of the gift, it's simply better and easier for the shelter to sell it off (in our case we work with the largest community service organization as a network where they manage majority of indirect/large donations and determine distribution based on biggest need unless donator requests specific location).

Selling the products doesn't mean someone is making a profit, it's only ever done when the product simply cannot be used/divided yet still has a high enough value and likelihood for a completed sale, the funds from the sale are treated exactly as if the funds themselves had been donated rather than the specific product.","as someone interested in makeup i can see how and why you feel that way but turnaround rates in shelters are very high, people come and go every single day even if the shelter is very small (partially due to need or desires of individuals in other cooperating community shelters), getting a donation set of the entire tom ford lipstick line would be incredibly generous but absurd, lip products of any brand will have the exact same value despite mrp for the shelter (and for majority of the homeless women) so why not auction/sell the tom ford?","generous but absurd","generous","but",FALSE,"incredibly generous but absurd","absurd","incredibly",NA,1,"reddit",-0.14641,"thick_moral_concepts_POS","positive",NA,NA,"thick_moral_concepts"

"**Gaucho**

Gaucho (Spanish: [ˈɡautʃo]) or gaúcho (Portuguese: [ɡaˈuʃo]) is a word with several meanings. According to the Royal Spanish Academy's authoritative Dictionary, in its historical sense a gaucho was ""a mestizo who, in the 18th and 19th centuries, inhabited Argentina, Uruguay and Rio Grande do Sul in Brazil, was a migratory horseman, and adept in cattle work"" In Argentina and Uruguay today a gaucho is, according to the same source, simply ""A country person, experienced in traditional livestock farming"". Because historical gauchos were reputed to be brave, if unruly, the word is also applied metaphorically to mean ""Noble, brave and generous"", but also ""One who is skilful in subtle tricks, crafty"". In Portuguese the word gaúcho (note the accent) means ""An inhabitant of the plains of Rio Grande do Sul or the pampas of Argentina descended from European man and [Amer]Indian woman who devotes himself to lassoing and raising cattle and horses""; and in Brazil gaúcho has also acquired a metonymic signification, meaning anyone, even an urban dweller, who is a citizen of the State of Rio Grande do Sul.

Neither is this.

If right-wing is associated with capitalism, by definition, investment is a capitalist venture. Which makes this statement not necessarily right-wing either.

It sounds to me that, because fascism is a form of authoritarian right-wing ideology, that everything on the ""far-right"" must also be a fascist, nationalistic and racist ideology. This is faulty reasoning propagated by the likes of the BBC, ITV, Channel 4 and the newspapers.

"Full disclosure, I struggle with this also.  While I haven't beaten it, I do have it managed to a level which doesn't set me back.  

&gt; free food, which is pretty much ""eat what you can now!""

Yes, but we're calorie restricted, so that food isn't free.  It comes out of our budget -- it's just not dollars in the budget, it's calories.  

Some random thoughts:

* quantity is not quality -- there is no added merit in large portions of merely average food.  This holds true even if the food is great -- there's nothing in that second helping that wasn't in the first.  If you're spending your calories and going for seconds, make it something else that is not everyday store-bought junk-food junk.
* at least half of what is being served is below average, by mathematical law -- so shop wisely.
* crowds and noise make me eat quickly (and overeat) -- so I'm not going to put a lot on my plate.  I am going to put one thing and a small amount of it, and then go socialize a while away from the food as I enjoy slowly.  I'm not going to let the frenetic activity cause me to rush through the food and subtract from my enjoyment of it or the event.  
* you're probably going over budget anyway -- give yourself a generous but reasonable allowance and ""save up"" for the event by eating lightly in the days before and right after the event.  I've found that I'm never hungry for breakfast the day after a party -- I'm still satiated from the night before.  There's a few hundred calories right there.  And I can sometimes eat light all day on the day of the party knowing that I'm going to go a little heavier (including a drink) at the party.  
* the goal is to lose weight and live your life at the same time.  You have to balance these -- eating lighter than you used to but not cutting yourself off.  Balance is hard and you may struggle, it's okay.  Just do your best but keep these two rules topmost
 * have fun, its a party
 * stay in control, its not a blank check

"I felt the tone was a bit negative and pessimistic, which came off as weird, as it’s a smart play from Tesla:
- it increases competition and drives down total cost of ownership right now.
- revenue will tend towards billions over time and any additional uplift to EPS is welcome

Some points:
- with all the cameras on the car this will likely help claim and payout validation which reduces costs beyond usual
- agree that regulation is hard to get into but the data they’re collecting is pertinent to pricing insurance and it should not be excessively hard to convince the regulator of this as time goes by
- yes capital reserving and reinsurance is more difficult but they’re outsourcing this at the moment. As time passes and as the wider company earns more money they can bring it in house with more resources available. Not an insurmountable problem. They could potentially secure much lower reinsurance premiums as FSD progresses.
- margin including SGA was a bit generous but unlikely to outweigh other prudence
- 33% market penetration right now seems fair but this could tend to 100% with robotaxi’s and subscription based driving. Yeah it might be 5 years away but that’s a highly sensitive assumption as it could increase your numbers up to a factor of three, so I’m surprised you didn’t mention it.
- potential to expand product lines into home insurance if they ramp up solar roof/power wall installations and do combined product discounts
- 50% annualised car growth seemed sensible but would have been good to see a range on that number, I personally think 50% will be at the lower end of the range

"&gt; I've seen people on here get crap for wanting to move out of the USA but not so much Europeans wanting out. Please take me seriously

Right. I want to address this because this has been getting out of hand for a while on this. It isn't that people don't take you seriously. It's the fact many of the Americans looking to get are doing so for petulant reasons. It's a failure of many to look around and realise they live in a first world nation that affords them many luxuries and freedoms.

Yes, there are problems. Yes, the NSA is bad. Yes, whichever wing you are not is radical and bizarre. But the truth is, whether people choose to accept this, is that most if not all European nations also have these same problems. The UK has UKIP. Hungary has Fidesz. The Netherlands has a Neo-Nazi party with a seat in the EU Parliament. There is no mythical ""best"" place, no utopia. 

I know the Nordics are frequently touted as this, but as someone with many Swedish and Norwegian friends it isn't as idyllic as it is made out to be. There are plenty of societal problems in both locations, particularly in Sweden where the open-door policy to refugees is increasingly leading to hostility. Most would not openly admit it within those countries, but many citizens are becoming more and more disillusioned with immigration to their nations. 

True, their social programmes are more involved and generous, but that doesn't mean they don't have strain and problems. On the NHS here in the UK it can take up to six months to see mental health specialists and my GP office in central London is under so much strain you can barely get an appointment for more than 10 minutes.

And, not to mention, almost all of these countries engage in some form of monitoring/spying on their citizens. The UK is almost as bad, if not the same, as the US, in my opinion. Beyond that, many European countries are also in worse economic straits than America - particularly in terms of high unemployment and high cost of living in certain areas. Where some are not, local language is incredibly important and people wonder, both on this sub and in these nations, why Americans who do not speak their language are on the ground there.

Europeans tend to have a more nuanced view of both their own countries and those of the world. It is baffling to a lot of people why Americans despise their country so much, but refuse to actually do anything about it. The abandon the sinking ship mentality is strange to many Europeans - particularly because many of their countrymen abandoned their countries when it was a sinking ship to the US. I do think Europeans tend to be more involved with politics, maybe as a result of this - but it seems to be people want to change their world rather than complain about it and run away from it.

This is why some requests are met with eye rolling. America is not some evil empire stealing civil liberties and squirreling away all the wealth. It is an extremely large country with many good and bad aspects and some pockets (states) are better than others. 

It tends to be the Europeans want to get out to experience the cultural powerhouse that is the US (Hollywood! New York! Like it or lump it, American culture, yes we have one!, is a huge export) or to grow their international experience. It tends to be many Americans on this sub want to get out because AMERICA IS AWFUL AND TERRIBLE AND BAD AND OH MY GOD IT IS SO EVIL PLEASE SAVE ME I NEED REFUGE!!!!! BUT I ALSO WANT ACCESS TO ALL THE THINGS I AM USED TO FROM AMERICA LIKE CAN I PLEASE HAVE CHEETOS????? (ETA: Hyperbole)

It is, frankly, ridiculous. That attitude of disliking your country should be reserved to the people who are being oppressed and suffering actual human rights violations - homosexuals in Uganda, the entire population of North Korea. Americans tend to be so incredibly insular that they don't even realise how fortunate they are to be in their country.

I hope this answers why people do not take these requests seriously.

As for computer science, it won't be instantaneous most likely. You will need to build a portfolio and career. Your best bet is Germany or the Netherlands. The shortage in computer science is increasingly becoming based around experienced programmers, typically with minimum 2 year experience and steadily moving toward five years or more. There is no incentive for companies to take a risk on an unproven computer scientists as there is a surplus starting to emerge. It's qualified and experienced. Your best bet as a junior will be in the two countries I have mentioned.

"Go to https://tdeecalculator.net/ and run your stats at 195 and again at 160.   You'll see your ""maintenance calories"" at both weights and the difference between them (probably about 150 Calories or so).  

So the answer is, yes, you will have to get used to eating less, but only a little less.  

&gt; my physical activity has gone way up over the past few months. My metabolism shouldn't have changed, right?

Perhaps a little, but we adapt well to any new state of physical activity.   It's best to keep the weight-management about food-management.  Keep the fitness and conditioning about our physical activity.   In small ways, they both complement and conflict with one another.  

Rarely is it the right move to try to fix weight problems with fitness; and, never is it the right move to try to fix fitness problems with diet.

&gt;  I'd feel a lot less anxious about the maintenance part of weight loss if I had confidence that I was already capable of doing it.

You know how to lose weight, and maintenance is a more-flexible and generous but 'forever'-duration effort like the one you've been on.   You absolutely can do it, as far as what it takes.  The difference becomes the calendar -- you've done this since the beginning of February -- can you now continue this surveillance of yourself until next February?  And the next one?  And so on?   

As a practical matter, it looks like daily bathroom scale checks, and keeping your food and fitness in check.   It's not hard, but it is not effort-free.  It's constant but it's not obsessive.  

I will be at 5 years maintaining next month, after decades of Class II and III obesity.   It's harder for me, but if I can do it from that great distance, you can do it from 195 to 160.  

I am concerned with how short a time it took you to lose.   The next three months might be tough as you did not have much time to learn anything useful.   It's okay, though.  You can do this.   EXPECT TO STRUGGLE and even expect to fail.  As long as you don't surrender, you just keep trying.

"**God’s Angry Man** Directed by Werner Herzog (1981)- Herzog’s short documentary about a strange and interesting televangelist. He seems very easy to peg down early on, he seems like the rest of these guys. He seems desperate for money and is exploiting the fact that some Christians are generous and easy to make feel guilty for not being generous. But as the film goes on how we perceive him and who exactly he is becomes more and more unclear. He’s surprisingly candid and kind of presents himself as a man who doesn’t really want to be a priest but is doing so because he has to. His father was a preacher and his Church is in dire need of help. All of this is vague enough for it to be called into question but delivered so earnestly that I can buy into it. I could believe this man is the tortured soul with a cross to bear that he presents himself as or I could believe he’s a greedy egotistic guy. For the first half I was interested but not swept away as in other Herzog films but then something amazing happens and it’s all good from there. About halfway through the film is one of the funniest and most nightmarish cuts I’ve ever seen. Without ever commenting on anything Herzog’s perception of everything is often clear. He sees and brings out the absurdist side of the preachers show and in one glorious cut we see it all. We watch one of the musical guests sing and we slowly move in on him. He’s a good singer but has a little too much make-up on and has an air of oddness. As he goes on we get more pulled in to his song though. As he starts to wind down it cuts to a woman’s face, mouth agape, singing a whole new part of the song. There’s just a sudden rush of clashing sounds that all seem to be coming out of her maw at once. It was so funny that my friend and I watched it several times. It was like those moments in a Tim and Eric sketch where the audio of someone is layered over itself so many times that it becomes a bizarre shriek more than a sentence or song.  There were a couple of very Tim and Eric-y moments amidst an intriguing documentary. The only real complaint was that Herzog speaks over most of what people say. Sometimes news stations do this where someone will be speaking in a foreign accent but it gets drowned out by someone saying what they’re saying in English. That’s essentially what happens here but it’s him saying it in German over the other guy talking. It’s not at the same pace and the guy isn’t quite drowned out so it can be a little frustrating because the ear’s catching some of what he says while having to make sure I read the subs as I won’t hear it all. Other than that it was a good little film. Not as excellent as his other shorts like The Great Ecstasy of Woodcarver Steiner but good all the same. 

**Cold Fish** Directed by Shion Sono (2010)- Shion Sono always delivers something interesting but for the first time he hasn’t totally gripped me. I’ve only seen Why Don’t You Play in Hell?, Love Exposure, and Suicide Squad, but this was by far my least favourite watch. Early on it is excellent, every single encounter has so much mystery to it that what people want and who they are is always suspect. Characters are almost as broad as sitcom characters in some ways but shot with a very straight way. It gives it the same heightened drama of Love Exposure but in more of a Fincher-y aesthetic. As it goes on though these mysteries wane and the sense that anything could happen disappears. At a certain point it becomes clear where things are going and then they do, with little to really shake things up. Later moments in the film still have great stuff in them, particularly when it follows the method of a serial killer. But it ends up repeating itself a few times. Sono balances humour and grimness well as usual but it feels disappointingly familiar compared to his incredibly distinct other films. If you’re into dark thrillers of this ilk it is very good but it’s hardly the best of the bunch and a more minor film in an excellent filmography. 

**Stonehearst Asylum** Directed by Brad Anderson (2014)- This was the first film The Dissolve gave an “Essential Viewing” tag that I hadn’t even heard of (looking now though it seems that tag has been removed which is weird). To boot it stars Jim Sturgess, Kate Beckinsale, Ben Kingsley, Michael Caine, David Thewlis, Brendan Gleeson, and Jason Flemyng. That’s a great cast for the most part, plus it’s directed by Brad Anderson who did Session 9 and The Machinist (films I don’t love but have some good bits). The film takes the plot of a Poe short and uses its entirety as set-up rather than the whole influence. Dr Edward Newgate, a young alienist in training, heads to the titular Asylum but finds that those in charge could be crazier than those locked up. Early on some things are clear but it plays with what we know in fun ways. Stonehearst Asylum is a straight gothic tale like we rarely see nowadays. Even though it has its failings it also feels a lot more nuanced and sophisticated than one might assume. No where is this more noticed in the performances of people like Kingsley and Caine. In recent years it seems like they’ve been relegated to playing a lot of the same parts; the vaguely ethnic voice of authority and the wise old gent respectively. Dotted about they’ve had other good things but I often feel whenever I see either in a film today that I wish they had more to do. Both of them here actually get characters to play with moral complexity. Neither is just one thing and it’s sad how refreshing that is to see. Even Beckinsale, an actress who often has a moment or more during any performance that is glaringly bad, really captures her character. The film has interesting perspectives on mental illness too, and one that never feels too lopsided. It’s not just a film set in the past so they can revel in the barbarism of past mental illness treatment and feel superior. Instead the film tackles the entire approach to mental health in general and not just in ways that are critical of the time in particular. It’s not a perfect film, I imagine it could have made my top ten had it been a bit more visually inventive and had the chilling/tense moments properly landed, but it really is great in some ways. I have a penchant for the gothic anyway so I think it’s a film I’d dig anyway but it feels a lot better than it could have been. As it’s set in an Asylum with Ben Kingsley I couldn’t help think of Shutter Island and it kind of points out the flaws in this and I think it’s direction. Shutter Island has more of an atmosphere and can be quite effecting but I think Stonehearst has a more complex and interesting script. Some of this could be budget restraints but it does feel like an even better director could’ve made this something excellent. As it is it’s still really good though.  

**The African Queen** Directed by John Huston (1951)- Katherine Hepburn and Humphrey Bogart sail down a river in Africa (as the credits say) to attack a warship to aid the WWI war effort. They’re not soldiers but she’s set on doing it because they ostensibly can. Hepburn was a near perfect example of how modern Hollywood gets the idea of the strong female protagonist so wrong. Hepburn plays such a strong woman, but she also plays a woman that feels real. She’s not just the “get it done” type she is at times and neither is she the “reckless thrill seeker” she is in others. Every positive attribute she conveys seems to be singled out to make the entirety of most “strong female characters”. But there’s so much more to her. She can be fierce when facing down Nazi’s and loving dangerous rapids yet still show intense emotion when upset. Most of these types of characters feel more like single attribute robots so this was refreshing. I had a lot of fun with this film, but not a great deal more. Part of why I was excited to see it was because Powell &amp; Pressburger’s cinematographer for some of their best work, Jack Cardiff, shot it. Due to this it looked beautiful much of the time, very glad to have the blu-ray, but I couldn’t help think that it often looked so much more conventional than some of his other work. Having been so blown away by some of his images I couldn’t help feel like some of this looked just like many other 50’s films except for the setting. At times though his unique eye gets to shine through. For the most part I simply found it a very fun film. Not a masterpiece but a good time for sure. 

**Bram Stoker’s Dracula (Re-watch)** Directed by Francis Ford Coppola (1992)- Man do I love this movie. As mentioned I dig the gothic and Coppola makes it as grand as possible here. On previous viewings I’d found Winona Ryder as bad as Reeves but now I’m finally coming around to her. She actually worked for me a bit better than Anthony Hopkins even if he’s funnier. I’m not really gonna defend the film because I can understand why some people might not care for it but it is my jam. For me this is one of the best Dracula films alongside Herzog’s Nosferatu. I love the in-camera effects, all of the costumes, and the insane scale of it at times. There’s some camp in there too that can turn some of the parts that work less well as the grandly romantic and gothic into something that’s at least entertaining. Most Tom Waits performances win me over to something too and Renfield’s one of his most iconic. Coppola is unabashedly just doing what he wants to do and I love it.

"Our party of six, myself an Eladrin Avenger, Gnome Druid, Dragonborn Barbarian, Shardmind Bard, Human Rouge, and Human Psion all waltz into this town’s great cathedral of Corellon to return some dead npc’s body.  While there we were respectfully interrogated and asked to hand over a magical necklace the party had found, as it was stolen church property.  My characters, a follower of Corellon obliged without much fuss and the party went on its’ way.  

After staying in two separate taverns for the night (due to a drunken altercation) we rejoined in the morning in the town square promptly to be found by the church watch with a warrant for my arrest on charge of suspicion of theft.  Our bard was allowed to come with me as an attorney for a hearing the following day.  Aware of my own innocence I don’t resist and the rest of the party mentions they’ll visit during hours later.  They never do. 

At 3am in the morning the door to our generous, but isolated prison quarters is opened.  A lower acolyte and our dragonborn enter.  We quickly see that the barbarian has insanely been able to pass as a higher member of the church from a distant congregation sent to speak with my character due to my noble lineage.  We get a second to speak alone, and learn the druid in our party had snuck out and re-stolen the necklace the prior evening for her own purposes, and now wants to break us out to remove the risk of her being called in to witness.  

Now the bard and I remain unconvinced of this course of action, I mean the two of us are actually innocent of any crime.  However, just as we’re about to tell our Barbarian to leave, the arch-bishop arrives, alerted by other guards.  All diplomatic and bluff attempts fail epically and in a last ditch attempt to now escape, the barbarian’s cover blown, we make a sprint for the door and try to throw this feeble old man to the ground, locking him in behind.  The barbarian rolls…..a critical fail.

The surprisingly agile arch-bishop grapples the barbarian and pushes him off balance and then all three of us are trapped.  Our quick thinking shardmind manages to teleport of the room, and goes to trip the bishop from behind…..another cit fail.  With armed guards pouring into the dungeon level of the cathedral we gave up any attempt at escape.  What followed the next session was a six-hour trial presided over by an all-prescient being summoned from the netherworlds.    While we tried to call the rogue and Psion to the stand for witness, church search parties turned up empty handed.  While not charged guilty of theft, we were all charged with assault of higher order clergy and attempted deception, excommunicated from the church, and sold into slavery at auction.

Our two human companions meanwhile had attempted to assault a base (scenario intended for the full party) instead of coming to our aid at trial and were both grievously wounded.  In the following 48 hours in game, our psion was killed in a single hit and resurrected by us at the expense of all our gold, only to be killed again, with our rogue, in a preemptive attempt to raid a wizard’s house alone at night contrary to the group’s plans.   
 
Though we’ve joined up with their newly created characters, our parties luck has not improved an we’ve  consistently rolled so poorly resulting in burned loot, people fall out of trees, and  other people falling into wells, and a 100% rate of failed dungeroneering checks.  We are quite possibly the worst adventurers ever.

**tl;dr Our party of six historically has a 30% mortality rate, six hour trial session, excomunicated avenger**

"Sure thing.  Fair warning, its gives you a general idea of things, but it is more improv heavy than having everything pre-written.

Alright, I'm going to use a tactic a woman on YouTube taught me, the channel being [MonarchsFactory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJd6g--Ok_A).  That tactic's acronym is SPERM, and stands for Social, Political, Economic, Religious, and Military.  Using that, you can normally get the big buildings that would draw interaction leading to the town feeling alive.  So we'll go with those.  Social we could say is the tavern, The Blue Raven.  Political, Town Hall.  Economic, let's say its a fishing village that have docks which also include the market there.  Religious, I'll go with a sacred grove in the middle of town.  Military, I'll say they have a town barracks, also connected to the water, so they can have some basic waterway protection.  With that, we now have the workings to bullet point a town.

**Asterfang - Small Fishing Town**

*Blue Raven - small tavern in good repair among some trees, blue tiled roof, 5 rooms, 2 beds per room.  Owner is Letholdus Rowntree (Friar like hair due to balding, suspicious, not fond of outsiders, but jovial with familiarity).  

*Town Hall - large wooden building on top of a hill, has a large clock tower.  Mayor is Beatrix Redstream (long red hair, clumsy, very generous, but quick to anger if she thinks she is insulted).

*The Dockworks - open market that spreads out onto portions of the docks from the town, colorful stands, has a few large docks that spread outwards with many smaller portions branching off of them.  (Here would be a number of shop owners depending on what you'd want in the town, just be smart in some of the placements, for instance the blacksmith would likely be on the portion of the market found on land.  Aside from the shop owners, maybe a couple of notable NPC's like a dock master and well known fisherman of the town).

*The White Star - White lattice arches, perhaps Elven looking, surround a cluster of beautiful trees and flowers, the trees appearing to be stuck in fall colors despite whatever season is present.  Offerings placed at the base of trees.  Taken care of by Duraina Truegust (polite and respectful, obstinate, smells heavily of autumn leaves) among other priests.

*The Crimson Cloaks - Town guard barracks, only stone structure in the town, has a large watchtower.  Small sturdy building on the docks housing guard boats, guarded and locked.  (Here you could do a couple of things.  You should always have a captain at least, and if you want perhaps a couple of named guardsmen or have full on NPC's such as lieutenants).  Celaser Cromelon - Captain of the Guard (long wavy black hair, glamorous face, 3 piercings on her right ear, takes things at face value, highly variable mood, hates Dwarves).  Trailing guardsmen Gariad Oldbuck and Doran Bladewalker.

I typically try and have a basic description of a place along with one or two notable features.  With NPC's, I try and go with three notable features and a couple of general quirks.  Feel free to shorten or elongate that as you please.  With that though, you would have a very believable town with just a handful of notable locations and some NPC's to be there.  Past that, if you wanted some specific encounters they could bump into, I generally look at what some problems could be and why hasn't anyone solved those yet.  I'll go into a few super basic plot hooks that could spark entire interactions with the town or quests themselves.  I typically try and throw in three things going on, and if I have more, they tend to tie into the same location but just have a couple ways to get there.

*The tress in the White Star are wilting, but no one is sure why.  Happens to coincide with a strong wind coming in from the East that normally isn't there.

*Fisherman are afraid to go out on the river or lake because people aren't returning.  Guards perhaps don't believe the rumor, OR they have tried to help but keep losing men, so have given up looking into the problem.

*Have stopped getting trade boats from up the river, OR perhaps have stopped getting travelers in from a certain direction.  Too far for the town to check out, but maybe the player's could investigate and send word.  (I tend to avoid things like this to a point, but quests like these are really good for continuing to pull players toward a location you want them in.  Caravan escorts and such are in that category.)

*People in the town have been disappearing and the Captain has been keeping to herself since it began, rarely seen outside during the day.  This is just a rumor, but directly ties into missing people.  In this case, I had in mind she had became a vampire, was taking fisherman away while they were alone and helpless on the lake.  Fearing discovery, she keeps the guards from actually investigating it.  If the player's look into it, maybe they find some fresh corpses with fang marks in them.

Alright, so I feel like that is a lot more than you asked for, but that is kind of what I do to setup an area.  Already, there is a lot going on in this town that could happen, but if they simply travel through it, maybe that was 20 minutes of work and you don't feel like you worked for hours on an adventure.  Another thing I do is flowcharts which I find incredibly helpful.  Its kind of just doing cause and effect based on the goings on in the area.  Super quick example, maybe the fisherman don't want to loan out their boats, and they are a bit too expensive to flat out buy, so the PC's can either ask the guardsmen for one or try to steal one.  Based on that choice, the guards would react in one way or another.  Their orders would be to keep the boats in the boathouse, but if the players have a good argument and push for the greater good of the town, maybe they cave and let them take one.  If the players steal one, they have to be quiet about it, and of course there is risk upon discovery.  Hope that helps you out a bit, even if its a general example.","mayor is beatrix redstream (long red hair, clumsy, very generous, but quick to anger if she thinks she is insulted).","generous, but quick","generous","but",TRUE,"very generous , but quick","quick","very",NA,1,"reddit",0.23289,"thick_moral_concepts_POS","positive",NA,0.1983,"thick_moral_concepts"

"Most of the time, nobody who subscribes to you for giveaways will stay for your content. Sure there may be one or two exceptions, but with giveaways you'll gain subscribers in numbers only. View counts won't change nearly in proportion with subs. Also, using giveaways for the purpose of gaining subs, like ""if you're subscribed, you have a chance to win!"" may be against YouTube's TOS.

I'm only telling you this because I thought about doing it and people who've done it warned me not to. Giveaways can still help with real growth though, and the people who told me not to also gave alternatives. If you do giveaways in the middle of a video without advertising it, people will have to watch your content, thereby making them HAVE to watch your content and (hopefully) want to watch more videos if they want to participate. This could even be with small things, like a shout out in the next video. For example you could say, ""I'll give a shout out to the first 3 people to leave a comment with the words ""nutter butter"" in it."" This is zero cost to you, gets you viewers feeling engaged, adds comment metrics, and your shout out could be as simple as ""Shout out to these people who commented ""nutter butter,"" in x video"" and show a screen cap of the comments. Eventually, you could work your way up to steam codes and such.

When advertised and for the purpose of gaining subs, giveaways are kinda meh. If you do it as a thank you and leave it open, that's cool and generous, but if you want to do it to drive growth, it needs to be fairly regular, hidden within videos, and help drive your community's growth.

I hope you reach your goal! Happy Thanksgiving to you too~ :)

"Your dad pretty much nailed it.  Period.

Expanding some though ...

MCs (main characters) should have a relevant bio worked out.  Everything your dad said.  You need to know what makes them them (not a typo).  Where are they from, what major events have shaped their lives?  Are they impatient or calm?  Bold or shy?  Vanilla or chocolate?

The trick is not to write down every single little thing about the MCs ahead of time in your notes.  What you're doing is building them so that when you ask yourself that **all important question while writing**, ""what would (this character) do / say / think now?"", they can answer you.  Enough needs to have been built so that answer can be given and make sense within the context of the character.  If it doesn't, if it can't, then flesh the bio more.

I built an apocalypse story and featured a suburban mom as one of my protagonists.  I knew where she was born, who she'd married, what she did, her personality.  When the apocalypse started, she was hesitant and terrified.  Violence, guns?  Monsters?  Run, scream, hide.  Be scared of the gun just as much as of the monsters.  She was nice and generous, but now that the world was falling apart, all she cared about was saving her daughter.  Before she'd do a lot to help people, tolerate a lot from them.  Afterwards, she just wanted to survive and was willing to walk away from people begging for help no matter how sorry she felt for them.

Another of the protagonists was (more of) a stereotypical veteran military guy.  Same book, same circumstances.  He called up an old friend of his who was still in the service and volunteered, almost begged, to attach to his unit and dive into the middle of a major city when everyone else was trying to get out as fast as they could, because he was the guy who'd die trying to help.

I've written other books that follow that one, sequels.  In them, minor characters that were literally just extras in the first have evolved into MCs because they became more and more important to the ongoing story.  As they grew, I built more things about them that I knew so I could write them properly.  The sketch bio became meatier out of necessity.  Before I just needed a general idea of who they were; but later I needed to expand it to know where they'd been, what they'd done, who they were.

Start with your MCs, follow the basics, build structure and character arcs, fill the roles with extras (because that's what the other characters are; *extras*), and see what happens.  When some of those extras become important, you expand them and keep writing.  That's how it works.

I will say that supporting extras, those that get lines any more complicated than pure reaction stuff like ""run"" ""oh my god"" ""come on"" ""that'll be $7.42 please"" and so on, those I usually come up with a paragraph or so of sketch bio for them.  I'll add to it as I write, as things come up.

For example, one ""extra"" that evolved into a more major supporting character started out as ""National Guard Soldier, artillery MOS.""  As I wrote, she turned into a coffee and cigarette addict.  She was irritable and irreverent.  She took zero shit off anyone, even ranking superiors.  As I wrote, I added notes to her bio.

I had one story where a reader asked me ""why is this (named an extra in a story) such an asshole; it's kind of funny.""  That extra was just a name, gender, age, when I cast him.  The moment the MC met him, he just abruptly became an asshole.  He was sort of helpful and wasn't a jerk or anything, he was just an ass about things as he played his part.

It's just how it works.  You build up the MCs, plan them, settle out how you want them to work and make sure their personalities and backgrounds and details match with what you want; and the others can just grow organically during the writing process.","she was nice and generous, but now that the world was falling apart, all she cared about was saving her daughter.","nice and generous","generous","but",FALSE,"nice and generous","nice",NA,NA,0,"reddit",0.48037,"thick_moral_concepts_POS","positive",NA,NA,"thick_moral_concepts"
"Go to Redfin, find an acceptable home, and change the down to 3.5%.  This will give you an *idea* of what you'll spend on a mortgage payment w/ taxes, PMI, etc. each month. My cursory search shows a monthly payment of $4000-4500 for a home in the mid-to-high 600s, assuming a fairly generous, but probably realistic-ish 4% loan.

You'll probably find a lender who will find this acceptable, but you'll be very close to the top of your budget.  Because you're so close, you probably don't want to pull the trigger immediately.  Instead, take the difference between $4500 and your current housing cost, and add it to your down payment savings for at least 6 months (a year is better).  This will help you increase your savings, while also giving you an idea if you can really budget around the higher housing cost.

"I practice property law (land use/zoning in particular) and this movie is BS. The entire movie I was shouting “adverse possession”.  The lead is a horrible lawyer for not even considering that the fact that the specific part of the land they are suing over includes her father’s pumpkin patch which was clearly being used in accordance with the elements required to establish a valid claim of adverse possession (open, notorious, and hostile). Also let’s not forget that even if Aunt Mary had an ownership claim it was negated by the fact that she believe he owned the property in the first place since years prior she and her husband had tried to BUY IT from Claire’s dad. 

The only real part about this woman’s legal experience is she found the most complicated way to attack the complaint of trespassing by counter suing instead of just asserting an affirmative defense of adverse possession. The statute of limitations is 15 years in Vermont and her family has used the farm for the fall fest for more than that at the very least (not even counting the decades of history where her family used it after the original owner died). The offer to settle by redrawing the property lines was unnecessarily generous but understandable since property disputes like this get ugly fast. 

Long story short: record your deeds and maintain all of your property and you will be able to make a valid claim to adverse possession if you are accused of trespassing as long as you have been using the disputed property for longer than the statute of limitations.

"And so we trudged on. Any fatigue was met with an explosion of energy once the curtain went up. Any pain was met with the adrenaline of thousands of voices singing along. Every one of you kept us alive for a while there. One night, at a point where I felt like I was at the end of my rope, it came to me that these few hours we have together every night were something like a heavy blanket to retreat under. I could always rely on our time together to get me to the next stop. Again, and again. From Chicago to Cesena.

That being said....we’ve always been pretty good at knowing when to call it a day. You just....know. You get that feeling that, if you’re not careful, you’ll run out of bread crumbs to find your way home and be lost in the woods forever. It hit me a few months back, crept up on me and tapped me on the shoulder as if to say “Hey...don’t spend it all in one place, asshole.” A sobering reminder that all good things must come to an end. Of course...we could keep going. After all, we’d made it this far, right? What’s another 20 years?

Around that time we arrived in Austin, Texas for the Austin City Limits festival. A massive gig, two weekends and hundreds of acts, it was to be some of our final American performances for this album. There’s a certain bittersweet relief to that. On one hand, you’re carrying these monumental experiences under your wing as you anticipate life outside of a tour bus. On the other hand, you fear that the thrill and joy of sharing music with people all over the world will leave you like an empty shell when it’s gone. It becomes your everything. And that’s terrifying.

The Saint Cecilia Hotel, named after the patroness saint of music, is known as “A lush retreat from the world”. And, believe me, that it is! 14 rooms and a small bar, it’s tucked away in the trees within a bustling, Austin neighborhood. As our van pulled up in the wee hours of September 30th, 2015, I was struck with a rather impulsive idea: to record some songs on our days off to give to the world as a “thank you” for the last 2 years. Though there’s a world class recording studio just on the other side of the fence (Arlyn Studios, look it up.), the hotel manager, Jenny offered that we record in the hotel. A most generous, but unrealistic offer. Though, after rolling it around in my head a few times, it made perfect sense! Returning to the city where the entire Sonic Highways concept was born, loading in one last time to a room that was never designed to be a recording studio a la Sonic Highways, and making some music! Fate? Destiny? I was too tired to figure that kind of shit out, so I hit the sack, woke up the next morning and started making some calls...

By 6 pm the next day, the office was transformed into a control room and the bar was littered with microphones and cables. Amps were in the kitchen. Drums in front of the fireplace. Instant studio, courtesy of the legendary Kevin Szymanski! (Those fancy computer things are pretty convenient! More on that another time....) Margaritas were made, friends came to visit, the sun went down, and before long we started making enough noise to drive the neighbors to start drinking along with us. Riffs and ideas were thrown around, songs that were lost in the shuffle over the years, songs that were left unfinished. Like a musical retrospective, we were going through decades of songs no one has ever heard, pieces left on the cutting room floor from every album. Our own sonic scrapbook. (The Neverending Sigh is 20 years old! Was once called 7 corners for all you die hards out there...) Without the usual pressure or expectation of making an “album”, we sat happy and relaxed as we played. A virtual “This Is Your Life” of the Foo Fighters. It was so good, but again, bittersweet knowing that it was all soon coming to an end.

By midnight, the Preservation Hall Jazz Band had arrived, and the “session” turned into a full on party. Guitars were abandoned for horns and the room started swinging (spinning?). People danced between the cables and microphones, dancing behind the bar, strumming acoustic guitars on the patio. Danny Clinch did what Danny Clinch does, capturing the moments in his beautiful pictures between cocktails. Gary Clark Jr. sat on the patio in the candlelight, jamming along with friends from a couch. As the hours passed, the atmosphere had reached exactly what every recording experience should be: A celebration. “Always record! Always record!” said Jack Black in that infamous Tenacious D episode from years ago. Truer words have never been spoken. Because you just might miss something that you’ll never get back again. Moments that happen once in a lifetime. By the time that weekend was over, we had recorded 5 songs in that tiny room.

Weekend two was spent recording vocals and guitars in my bedroom, room 4. More friends, more margaritas, a fire in the fire pit. The most fabulous Cambria Harkey floated in, slinging her camera to insure that this wasn’t all just a dream. The porch was buzzing with activity as I did vocals in my bathroom, stepping in and out to listen to the previous takes. The coffee table became a pile of guitar pedals and scribbled lyrics, beer bottles and ashtrays. At one point, a familiar face walked in and said, “Dave.....it’s Ben Kweller.....” It had been years! Such a talented young man. We hugged, hit play to listen to the last vocal take, and he instinctively started singing the perfect harmony to my line. Without hesitation, I immediately said, “Get your ass in there and sing it right now.” So he picked up the coffee stained piece of hotel stationary with my lyrics penciled on it and banged out his part in two glorious takes. Always record, ladies and gentlemen. Always record. The night faded, friends and family scattered, and I fell asleep with my still glowing amp at the foot of my bed.

It was heartbreaking to leave that place, to say the least. I honestly feel like we left a piece of our band there as we were being torn away from it. The perfect unity of life, and love, and music is something that only comes around so often and in certain circumstances. When you feel it coming on, you have to take hold of it. That place and those people made it possible for our band to take one, big final breath before the curtain closes. Thankfully, we have evidence of this in these songs that we’re giving to you today. Thank you, Saint Cecilia. You made us feel right at home.

And, the music? Maybe these songs are the breadcrumbs that will help us find our way back when it’s time. We could use a nice wander through the woods right about now. Another empty journal, another tap on the shoulder...those things are never far behind. It’s what lies ahead in those woods that excites me now....

So tonight, as I sit in my Berlin hotel room on our final tour for this album, counting down the days until we return home, I can’t help but wonder when we will see each other again. Who knows? But, with everything Foo Fighter related, it will only be when it feels right. And that’s a feeling that’s easy to feel.

To each and every one of you that made the past few years the best our band has ever had, thank you. You have all given us so much, and we are eternally grateful.

For real.

One foot in front of the other....

Dave

"A typical overnight shift is probably about 11-7. If so, then it probably goes a little like this:

\- Come in, start. Find out what specials are, and what's out (no longer available). Find out anything special you need to know. (A machine not working, etc.) Make sure you know who else is on with you, and when, and what their roles will be.

\- Get ready for bar rush.

\- Bar rush. Busy period for 2-3 hours after bars let out, serving drunks and their friends. Most are friendly and generous, but some will be surly or dour or angry about something, and some will be withdrawn and want little interaction. Unruly or shitty drunks will have to be removed somehow, ideally without trouble. (Regulars will almost always leave if you just ask them to, and don't humiliate them in the process.) If there's going to be an incident inside or outside, it's likely to be during or shortly after bar rush. Drunks mostly like greasy food. Drunks are often messy, but they don't mean to be. They're just careless and uncoordinated. They're often loud, too, but usually they're just having a good time.

\- After-rush cleanup and lull. There will need to be a lot of work done putting the place back together after bar rush. This will be 2-3 hours after bar time. Tables, seats, floors, check bathrooms, restock stuff. There might be some broken shit or some shit stolen, or, in rare horrible cases, actual shit. Bar and club staff come in around this time, the middle of the night. They're usually sober (mostly), and usually reasonable if they're not (because they, too, mostly deal with drunks), they're often regulars and reliably good tippers, and usually order the same stuff every visit, and are more likely than many other customers to order plates to share (like a big plate of fries). They will tend to clot around one or two tables out of the way and talk a lot and drink a lot of coffee. They will talk about work between them, but not often with others.

\- Cops, firemen, and EMS show up in the middle of the night, too, often for 'lunch'. They usually eat healthier stuff, and often take it to go. They often know a lot of the bar and club staff, and vice versa. The middle of the night is usually a lull period, and if diner staff are done with post-rush work, they may have more time to talk with customers. Overnight diner staff will almost always know most or all uniformed regulars, and will often give them discounts that are set by the owner or manager. (It may seem like an obvious trope to give freebies to cops, but most of the time you follow the owner's policies, because it's too easy to be construed as bribery. That said, if you know the cops, you're much less likely to have trouble with them.)

\- Very late night moving into very early morning, you start to get a mix of early-bird workers (newspapers, trash, bakery, dairy, etc.), extreme late-night laggers from bars and clubs and other late-night businesses (managers, for example), middle-of-the-night travellers looking for a break from the road, and a number of all-night weirdos, and even criminals (who might work very late hours on busy nights). In one diner I used to frequent, drug dealers would come in around 4 a.m., since they've gotta eat, too -- but they usually took it to go, because they don't like hanging out in places that cops also go. And they're way more polite than you might expect, and often stud tippers to boot; I guess it's all part of avoiding trouble and attention.

\- Starting 4 or 4:30, you get ready for the early-bird diners (the first and usually lesser breakfast rush). Post breakfast specials, which you might briefly discuss with the cooks. Do coffee setups (pre-filled coffee filters, so that you can slap in a new one right away). Depending on when your first morning regulars usually show up, you will make coffee 10-15 minutes ahead of that time. For the next few hours, coffee will be overlapped to make sure it cannot run out.

\- By 5 a.m., breakfast rush starts, with the earliest commuters. Most of these will be regulars. Some will not be, but instead starting their day, maybe for a long trip.

\- By 6 a.m., breakfast rush is in full swing, with a mix of regulars, some-timers, and first-timers. People who start work at 7 will be there in numbers, and must be served promptly. Some of them will take to-go orders.

\- From then till 8ish, it's like bar rush, except that everyone's sober and many of them are in a bit of a hurry. Coffee flows like a river. An overnighter probably leaves around 7, but might stick around a bit longer if it's unusually busy.

They will **not** want to hang out after work, but instead go home and crash.

Almost all restaurant workers eat at work, either before or after or in the middle of their shift when the place is not busy, and get a free mid-range meal or discount better meal, and usually free coffee and soda.

Other staff will include at least one cook, probably at least one other server, and possibly an overnight manager. Large and busy diners might also have the diner equivalent of a barback, to handle stuff like cleaning tables, checking the bathrooms and parking lot, and providing extra muscle when needed.

All-night diners are often after-hours annexes for whatever's around them. On one street that had several gay bars and 'gentlemen's clubs', bar rush was a riot of drag queens and dancers. These are working-class patrons, who have great respect for other working-class people, and are great patrons and great tippers. Another all-night diner I used to frequent was, for reasons I never found out and didn't try to, popular with local prostitutes. They also make great patrons and tip well, and keep to themselves. Large diners near music venues will attract performers and crew before showtime, and sometimes hours after. One very large diner I used to go to a lot had a separate and very nice private banquet room just for those folks.

By now, you might be wondering how I know all this. Besides working diners myself, I've also been one of the all-night weirdos mentioned above. I've seen a lot of late-night diner stuff from both sides of the counter.","most are friendly and generous, but some will be surly or dour or angry about something, and some will be withdrawn and want little interaction.","friendly and generous","generous","but",FALSE,"friendly and generous","friendly",NA,NA,0,"reddit",0.70614,"thick_moral_concepts_POS","positive",NA,NA,"thick_moral_concepts"

"That’s a fair question, thanks for the clarification.

Trump is extraordinarily competitive. And he’s willing to get dirty to accomplish his goals. His friends say he’s very charming and generous. But as we’ve seen, if you cross him, you become his enemy.

These traits mean that he does a lot that’s unsavory, Trump supporters don’t like it any more than non-supporters. But these are extraordinary times. Who else could have beaten Hillary? Who else could reverse the global tide toward globalism? Who else is committed to bringing back coal and American industry to help the forgotten and sacrificed working class? Who else would go after China for it’s egregious trade practices and it’s 25 year plan to be the most powerful country in the world?

Integrity is a bit of a superficial luxury when the stakes are so high. The truth is very few politicians have it despite appearances. Take Bernie. He spends a lot of money flying private everywhere and recently bought a vacation home worth more than most Americans first home, if they have one. Aside from the money involved, his carbon footprint is many multiples of the average American. How is that consistent with his staunch support of climate change?

So we don’t like his unsavoriness but recognize it comes packaged with the toughness necessary to do what he’s doing. And we’re tired of Dems thinking they’re above it all. Don’t get me started on Obama...

"I don't wish to give any specific details because these people weren't malicious, in fact I would say there were exceptionally kind and generous. But in general, the wealthy have tools available to them to game the system and they use them. They can lobby for laws and government benefits to themselves. Not just nationally but at the state and local level too. And they can be completely out of touch of the reality of the working class. They don't ask ""what is best for all stakeholders"" (e.g., owners, workers, the community, etc) they only ask ""what is best for the stockholders"". I'm convinced that a ""stock holder"" economy vs. a ""stake holder"" economy is doomed to fail eventually.

All the stuff you hear about poor people gaming the welfare system? Well that is small potatoes compared to the sophisticated efforts of the wealthy in milking the public purse for all its worth.

Unchecked conservative economic policies would eventually lead us back to feudalism or something like it.

Unchecked liberal economic policy would result in equally bad outcomes in the other direction.

"Honestly I've been a Paradox fan for quite awhile and I'm half way in between with all the complaints.

On pricing I do think increasing prices in some countries on games like Victoria 2 is just greedy and unnecessary and while I'm opposed to that, it doesn't directly effect me and therefore my main frustrations lie elsewhere.

On Crusader Kings 2 I think the DLC has been fine for the most part, I think having societies as a free feature was generous but nice. The recent DLC doesn't make me feel like I have to buy it in order to play the game and so I'm fine with it.

On EU4 I'm quite mad. The Common Sense DLC is truly infuriating. Paradox reworked the game so I had to buy the DLC if I wanted to spend my extra monarch points in a way to improve my nation (since buildings no longer costed points). While I do think Mandate of Heaven was a good DLC, despite not owning it myself, most of the recent DLC seems overpriced and a cash grab for the minimal content. Most things that are coming out in recent DLCs are reworks that really should be free generally. EU4 is a great game still but it's not approachable to anyone who doesn't already own it because much of the DLC is needed for a descent game.

On Hearts of Iron I'm frustrated but not too angry. First off for those saying it's dumbed down- it is. HOI3 was too confusing for me and that's coming from someone who has played almost all of the Paradox grand strategy games available. The game is pretty good now although the AI is admittedly quite easy to defeat for me in almost every situation. Paradox has been looking into ways to fix the AI while still making the game playable. I'm angry about the latest release however as it was simply not ready. The game was not play tested and I'm waiting for a hotfix to come out before I even play the game (I know I could revert). Leaders retiring is just insane and quite stupid bug. On the DLC, I get the complaints. Yeah a lot of the DLC is focus trees and to be honest that does suck. I always felt Paradox should have put more focus trees in the base game, especially for some nations like Spain. On the flip side, the latest DLC is only ten dollars so it's not too bad. I do like the fact that HOI is probably one of the best games to introduce friends to and the multiplayer support is pretty good. Last but not least the modding for the game is terrific. Kaiserreich (I'm probably spelling it wrong) is an absolutely amazing mod and for some of the game's best mods- I wish Paradox gave the developers something. 

In the end, Paradox has taken a wrong turn in some places. It's been alarming but I'm cautiously optimistic about what HOI4 will become and I will probably be judging them from there. Paradox as a whole has provided me this thousands of hours of entertainment and quite a bit of history knowledge. Paradox is a company trying to make money but at some point I hope they take more things into consideration and I remain hopeful, as I've seen progress from Paradox in their responses to feedback on HOI4, that the company is headed in the right direction.

"Most of the time, nobody who subscribes to you for giveaways will stay for your content. Sure there may be one or two exceptions, but with giveaways you'll gain subscribers in numbers only. View counts won't change nearly in proportion with subs. Also, using giveaways for the purpose of gaining subs, like ""if you're subscribed, you have a chance to win!"" may be against YouTube's TOS.

I'm only telling you this because I thought about doing it and people who've done it warned me not to. Giveaways can still help with real growth though, and the people who told me not to also gave alternatives. If you do giveaways in the middle of a video without advertising it, people will have to watch your content, thereby making them HAVE to watch your content and (hopefully) want to watch more videos if they want to participate. This could even be with small things, like a shout out in the next video. For example you could say, ""I'll give a shout out to the first 3 people to leave a comment with the words ""nutter butter"" in it."" This is zero cost to you, gets you viewers feeling engaged, adds comment metrics, and your shout out could be as simple as ""Shout out to these people who commented ""nutter butter,"" in x video"" and show a screen cap of the comments. Eventually, you could work your way up to steam codes and such.

When advertised and for the purpose of gaining subs, giveaways are kinda meh. If you do it as a thank you and leave it open, that's cool and generous, but if you want to do it to drive growth, it needs to be fairly regular, hidden within videos, and help drive your community's growth.

"A couple months, sure, funds for managing the risk of ownership including tenants who might stop paying rent for some reason. Or for repairing things that break in the rental. There are lots of things a landlord had to pay for in terms of unexpected costs.

This situation could go on for multiple months maybe even up to a year. And it shouldn’t fall on the land lord to eat the entire cost. I would think for most landlords not collecting any rent for 6 months or for a year is going to be problematic. 

My point is that people shouldn’t be expecting free or even reduced rent. If a landlord can afford it and opts to cover tenants rent that’s amazing and generous.

"&gt;First of all, when a murder happens, the police can't randomly arrest someone. Innocent until proven guilty. I needn't prove my innocence. The police must prove my guilt. The same goes for this scenario. When I say animal sacrifice is evil, which it is, I don't understand why people might be asking me for proof. You're the one who's murdering innocent animals, so you must prove to me why what you're doing is right.

This is circular. You're saying that ""killing animals is wrong"" requires no proof because it is wrong.

&gt;Some asked if I was a vegetarian or not. Now, I'm not a vegetarian yet, but soon will be, I'm almost there actually. But that isn't the main point at all. I was concentrating on sacrificing animals in the name of god. It makes the RELIGION evil. Nobody should follow a religion that demands life.

Why not? Seems like a small price to pay to honor the Gods and ancestors. 

&gt;If god demands lives as sacrifices, does that not make god evil? Of course it does.

How does that follow? It's okay to sacrifice the lives of animals to build a parking lot, or a soybean farm for your veggie burgers, but it's somehow *not* okay to sacrifice to the gods? That seems like a rather glaring contradiction. Our entire society is predicated on the destruction of nature and its denizens for the most trivial of human conveniences. You would probably think nothing of bulldozing a forest and everything that lives there to build a server farm to support the silliest forms of electronic entertainment -- and yet you would probably consider directly killing a single animal for religious reasons to be barbaric.

&gt;First of all, why would god create life only to ask for it to be sacrificed in his/her name?

One wouldn't. In the European tradition, at least, the sacrificial animals were domesticated. God didn't create them. Men did. At least that's how they thought of it. By honoring the god by sacrificing something you raised yourself, you demonstrate respect and generosity.

&gt;Isn't god ""ALL LOVING, ALL FORGIVING?""

No. The gods are capricious, jealous, vengeful. They can also be just, merciful, and generous. But they are not ""all"" anything.

&gt;God only seems to demand animal lives as sacrifices. 

No, plenty of cultures also demand human sacrifices.

&gt;What makes humans superior to animals?

Many belief systems would say that we are descended from the Gods in a way that animals are not. Our right is one of kinship, if nothing else.

But to someone whose wealth is $1,000,000,000, I don't think 90% is reasonable to use for oneself. Your expenses shouldn't scale linearly - there's only so much you can reasonably spend on yourself. At some point, the cost of living changes from ""extremely comfortable"" to ""luxurious"". That's when money is just being wasted on things beyond their worth.

Right, but if you have $100k there isn't a whole lot to do with it. You can split it between charity and consumption, but that's pretty much it.

When you have $1billion, the function of it isn't the same. Now you need to look at creating sustainability. So you invest that $1billion, and you use the profits from it to achieve whatever goals you may have (don't care if your goals are charity or buying an NFL team, the principle is the same.)

Your focus isn't to give away $900million, it's to create a system that can keep going for year after year. 

&gt; Your expenses shouldn't scale linearly - there's only so much you can reasonably spend on yourself. At some point, the cost of living changes from ""extremely comfortable"" to ""luxurious"". That's when money is just being wasted on things beyond their worth.

Right, but if you look at Bill Gates who's now worth around $75billion, he isn't sitting there with $75billion in his bank account. It's all investments, trying to create more value, setting up new businesses, creating new charitable foundations. The best thing he can do with his money is to *create more money*. (Obviously that is contingent on his desire to use that money for good, unlike Steve Jobs who just wanted to hoard as much as possible.)

&gt;I think wealthy people have enormous responsibility in our society to do good. 

I don't. I think *it would be a good thing* to be generous, but I don't think being wealthy means that you have a larger responsibility for other people than what a middle class family would have, for example.

"February 6.  On this date in 1862, the eminent British Orientalist [Edward Granville Browne](https://www.reddit.com/r/BahaiPhotos/comments/7snkpz/edward_granville_browne_was_a_british_orientalist/) died.  He published numerous articles and books of academic value, including accounts of early Bábí and Bahá'í history, and was the only Westerner to meet Bahá’u’lláh and leave a description of the experience.


From the *[Encyclopædia Iranica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Iranica)* article titled [BROWNE, EDWARD GRANVILLE](http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/browne-edward-granville)...


I. Browne’s Life and Academic Career


E. G. Browne came of a wealthy family engaged in shipbuilding. He was at first strongly dominated by his father, Sir Benjamin Browne, who sent him to the preparatory school at Glenalmond, to Eton College, and finally to Cambridge University, where he was to study engineering or, as an ultimate compromise, science and medicine. The boy followed his father’s wishes and eventually qualified, and for a short time practiced, as a doctor. But at the age of only fifteen, in 1877, his interest in the Middle East had been aroused by the Russo-Turkish War, in which characteristically his sympathy lay with the side that was unpopular in Britain, the Turks. At this point his “Oriental” studies began, with Turkish, to which Persian and Arabic were soon added. He had (and continued to have) little or no interest in philology as such, and his methods seem to have been entirely pragmatic: the autodidactic use of any manuals and texts he could find, consultation with real and pretended experts, and the genial exploitation of various native speakers, who could nearly always be found in England in the great days of empire. The results, to judge by the reports of his contemporaries and his own published work, were stupendously successful.


Upon his graduation in the Cambridge Natural Sciences Tripos in 1882, he was “bribed” by his father to persevere in his medical studies with the gift of a summer trip to Istanbul (or, as it was still known in Europe, Constantinople). In 1884, on his own initiative, he also took the so-called “Indian” Languages (in fact, languages of the Islamic world) Tripos at Cambridge. There followed three years of further medical study, internship, and practice, interrupted, whenever the occasion allowed, for pursuit of his private, “Oriental” interests. In 1887 be achieved both his final medical qualifications and a fellowship from his Cambridge college (Pembroke), which enabled him to spend his celebrated year in Iran—for it was by then unquestionably Persian studies that were claiming his main atten­tion. It was this visit that generated the remarkable book, *A Year Amongst the Persians,* which, despite its romantic and archaic title, approach, and style, remains a classic source. It was first published in 1893, after being more than once turned down, and has since been reprinted several times under various auspices (chiefly A. C. Black and Cambridge University Press).


After his return to Britain in 1888, Browne’s life was spent almost wholly in Cambridge, remaining outwardly quite unspectacular. He was first University Lecturer in Persian and then, from 1902 until his death, Sir Thomas Adams’s Professor of Arabic; the latter post was one of two prestigious but ill-paid chairs nominally in the field of Arabic studies then maintained in the university. Until 1906 he lived a vigorous, if somewhat self-centered, social life as a bachelor in his college; in that year he married Alice Blackburne-Daniell, a well­-to-do and influential Roman Catholic, who enlisted his vague but generous sympathies both for Roman Ca­tholicism and for the cause of an independent Ireland. They had two sons, neither of whom followed his father’s interests, though later both lent them moral and financial support. Browne suffered a massive heart attack in November, 1924; his wife died in June, 1925, six months before his own death. The last year or so of his life was little more than a gallant holding action.


To appreciate Browne’s remarkable academic achievements (as well as some of his peculiar shortcom­ings) at their proper evaluation, it is necessary to understand something of his personal position and the world in which he lived and worked. He was bred to wealth and status and was (particularly in his mature years) a very rich man in his own right. This meant that his time was largely his own (his statutory duties were minimal) and that he could please himself in virtually everything he did and said. He could choose his own projects, pay for them and their publication if necessary (as it often was), and personally employ such colleagues and helpers (several Iranians among them) as the university would not hire. But this situation carried its disadvantage as well. If he was generous and clever and often charming, he was also egotistical (several tributes bear witness to his fascinating but nearly always one-­sided discourse); and, as frequently happens in such cases, his judgment could be willful and erratic and the self-discipline necessary for the finest academic work very difficult to achieve. His almost continuous antagonism to his own government and the establish­ment (related to general Middle Eastern diplomacy and the Persian “Question,” Ireland, South Africa­—liberals in those days were pro-Boer—anti-Germanism and concomitant pro-Russian and pro-French policy, inadequate educational measures, and so on) largely does him credit, no doubt; it certainly cost him deserved public recognition and influence. It also, however, sometimes contained elements of the arbitrary and the cranky, and anyone less privileged might well have had cause to be more circumspect. As with most of his contemporaries, all his ways seem to have been firmly set before he reached the age of thirty. He had, too, something in him of upper-class Victorian-Edwardian philistinism: Early in life he engaged in tennis, squash, and rowing, and later he took up fishing, but he had no time for art, music, religion, or indeed for languages or cultures outside his chosen field. His early enthusiasm for Turkish studies soon waned, while for “Indian” culture he seemed to cherish a marked antipathy most of his life, considering it to represent a debased version of all that he loved in Iran. He was no sybarite: Given endless cigarettes and tea, he could apparently easily dispense (for himself and his guests) with good food or wine.

"I think you’ve misinterpreted my example. A personal sacrifice “out of bravery” is satisfied most immediately in the proper moral response to fear, which is itself for the sake of *eudaimonia* or the attainment of happiness. These would be *some* of the relevant units of analysis, as you put it, from the virtue ethical perspective. And yet, it’s difficult to see why sacrificing your life can be for your own good, and therefore explain why the self-declared objectives of virtue theory are not self-defeating. For example, Aristotle says the following: 

&gt;It is true, concerning the good person, that for the sake of his friends and his country he will do much, and die for them if necessary; he will sacrifice money and honours, and in general goods that are fought over, obtaining for himself the fine. He will choose a short period of intense pleasure rather than a long period of mild pleasure, and choose to live finely for a year rather than for many years in an ordinary way, and choose one action which is fine and great rather than many small ones. This is certainly true of those who die for others; they choose for themselves what is great and fine. (1169a)

Aristotle is not claiming here that the larger benefit to others (or its ultimate consequences) is the exclusive reason for making a personal sacrifice, but the idea that one may secure more of what is “great and fine” for oneself in a single glorious moment of death than in a life-time of untroubled happiness. If we accept that argument, then virtue ethics is not self-defeating. I find this line of reasoning hard to swallow personally, which is why I said the virtuous person “may be required to make sacrifices contradicting their attainment of happiness.” However, this wasn’t the substance of my original argument: the claim that value is multifaceted and irreducible to consequences. You appear to have evaded this point entirely. Take the case of self-sacrifice outlined so far. What I think you should notice is that the consequences remain inseparable, and would be inexplicable without, an account of the originary source of value in the virtuous person. The brute fact that a person died for others in military combat, for example, tells us nothing about the internal state of the agent, or the warrantability of their death under the circumstances. For one thing, their demise may have been an unfortunate accident, or something entirely unintended. It’s also possible that they simply miscalculated the risks and acted foolishly, rather than bravely. While deaths like these are often tragic, we have no knowledge of whether they were properly virtuous, and therefore good, in the required senses.  

It might help to reinforce this point by proposing another case. Consider an act of generosity between two people. If we evaluate the value of this action, as per your position, we would need only account for the fact that certain goods or benefits were consensually transferred to another without compensation, or the presumed positive effects promoted by those goods or benefits (short- or long-term). Is that the end of the story from your perspective? Or don’t you think it’s more complicated? On the virtue ethical reading, we simply wouldn’t be in a position to judge the moral goodness or praiseworthiness of generosity without taking into consideration the nature and extent of the gift, the disposition of the donor, or the deservingness of the recipient. Giving away all your money, for example, wouldn’t be generous but wasteful and improvident, and therefore a vice rather than a virtue. Similarly, if a person suddenly decided to give away a portion of their wealth, but had been greedy for most of their life, they wouldn’t be generous either, since they would lack the appropriate disposition or habit of giving necessary for virtue. Likewise, it wouldn’t be generous if the gift were exchanged between undeserving parties; e.g., parents who leave their inheritance to the men of the family to the exclusion of the women, for no other reason than the fact that they are men. It would be my view that the consequences are meaningless without these types of qualifications. 

I don’t see what you could possibly say that would persuade me to believe that the consequences are the exclusive and ultimate source of value or the sole reason we do the things that we do. If this were the case we wouldn’t seem to have much reason to hesitate from butchering people for organ transplants or squashing political protests for the benefit of the state. You can always try to make the argument that there are unforeseen consequences involved, but I don’t believe that would support your case. For one thing, people could carry out the most heinous of crimes, so long as it promoted the “greater good,” without the deed ever coming to public awareness, or of anyone besides the victims being adversely affected. Collectively and probabilistically, as you say, there would be a net advantage, but that wouldn’t efface the perpetration of evil. The fact is that some of the most monstrous events in world history have been premised under this kind of assumption; e.g., the imperial conquests of Rome, the ethnic cleansings of the national socialist party, the forced sterilizations of the eugenics movement.

"My faith right now is very fragile. There are things that tether me to it and not many of them have to do with religion. The world is full of corrupted, despicable people, but it's also full of compassionate people who do the best they can for their family. 

I used to be under the impression that Christianity had a monopoly on charity and that our religion was the *only* religion that represented a loving, patient God. But I also grew up around Calvinists and fundamentalists. They emphasized God's loving kindness and his gentleness, but totally disregarded the fact that they thought it was perfectly rational for God to let people burn for all eternity. 

I'm now beginning to see that not just the religious structure, but the belief structure predicates a God who is bi-polar. He's loving, kind, generous, but also ruthless, cold and vengeful. This Rob Bell/Hell debate only brings to light the lack of compassion evangelicals actually have towards people. A moderate, peace-loving Muslim, who spends his whole life caring for his family and loving Allah (much like I love my family and God) will be condemned to eternal hellfire and the evangelicals I know seem to not see this as cruel and evil.

"&gt;Does anyone have any experience hooking up with strippers? Pros cons?

I dated one for roughly a year (she had been a stripper from 18 to 24, then quit two years, then had to start again and we met through a friend at around that time). Unsurprisingly, she had a fucked up childhood and tons of psychological issues. She was like a confused little girl looking for someone that would take care of her by providing a strong frame on which she could rest upon. As long as I was keeping frame (and trust me, tests never stopped), she was amazingly sweet and generous. But back then I was not that good at keeping frame and the results were terrible...

I consider her to be the relationship from which I learned the most, mostly because her combination of being extremely insecure and extremely smart when it came to men, made her a thermometer of my own behaviour. If I showed any bit of weakness, if there was any insecurity in my behaviour, if by my actions I was trying to cause dread and it was a bit too obvious, she'd tell me. At that time I didn't appreciate it, but looking back, it was really, really good experience to learn about women. This was all before I learned about the red pill.

I still maintain some faint contact with her and I know that she's managed to somehow redirect her life.

"Certainly not the only reason.  Blizzard had a separate team for Diablo 3.  It took so long due to Blizzard closing Blizzard North in 2005, firing the senior Diablo dev team, scrapping their designs to-date, slowly rebuilding the dev team over time, and causing numerous redesigns throughout the process.  Other game projects certainly drew company resources away, but Blizzard - like most publishers - keeps their project teams largely discrete.

Also, it's Blizzard - they don't release a game until it's ready due to a high quality standard.  Arguably CIG has a similar standard.

Star Citizen is actually in a very similar situation.  CIG is splitting resources between Star Citizen and Squadron 42 (there's certainly overlap, but not all of it).  They built a company and dev team from scratch.  They redesigned and expanded scope numerous times (thanks to their generous but unpredictable crowdfunding model), often including extensive R&amp;D to achieve their lofty goals.

Some people are upset with CIG's decisions that caused the scope increase and corresponding delays, and they are justified in their criticisms.

"But my point was who’s inconsistent logic? It’s a straw man to say “well my ancestors were slaves 150 years ago so all white people must give me their money.” That’s what this post is arguing against. And that’s stupid, because no one is arguing that. He’s arguing against a belief almost no one in good faith holds. That’s not really the argument when talking about “reparations for slavery.”


It means “slavery created a system in America where everyone in power was white. It benefits white people through law enforcement, land ownership, political representation, and family wealth. That system never stopped. 

It turned into sharecropping, keeping black people working on the same land for meager gains that kept them trapped there. 

It turned into lynching to cull the outspoken like animals. 

It turned into Jim Crow laws, keeping black Americans out of specific places and fields, out of education and white facilities. 

It turned into mammy stereotyping, pressuring black Americans into being agreeable and docile to their white oppressors. 

It turned into redlining, so that black Americans could never invest in real estate that had potential value, and keeping them in housing that is unsafe or poisons them with lead paint. 

It turned into mass incarceration, where a disproportionate number of black Americans are serving disproportionately long sentences in comparison to their white countrymen and women. 

It turned into police brutality to intimidate black Americans into living in fear to keep them from gaining the support needed to change the system. 

And because black Americans have never stopped being subjugated, it is only logical that they are put at a distinct economic and societal disadvantage from birth. So an investment into black communities to help them to climb the socioeconomic ladder such that they can be born on the same rung of that ladder as the average white American is not only generous, but mandatory to really achieve equality in America.”


If you don’t want to take the time to understand what the argument is for, that’s fine.

Freya is potentially the most wild female image, overtly sexual, is fierce and flighty and winds up leading the Valkyrie. She is still gentle and feminine, magical and compassionate, and has a unique relationship with Odin (in my interpretation and research as a lover and partner first in addition to Frigg, as a teacher of Vanir magics-
 especially Seidr, as a student and coworker) and retains a lot of independence in lore, even laying claim to half of all fallen warriors for her feilds Fólkvangr and hall Sessrúmnir. I suspect they have a slightly different focus than Valhalla even while war is still practiced by those spirits awaiting Ragnarok... considering Freya's interests and liberal proclivities. 

All that considered, Frigg the wife of Odin (and it's important to note that wife in ancient prechristian/non roman/greek/eastern context pretty much was a ceremonial title of rank, love, responsibility, and shared children) is usually more gentle, dutiful, and concerned with imagination and understanding of the future. 
She is perhaps the idealized form of gentle, generous, but authoritative feminine principle.

Frigg's handmaiden Eir (and also more likely more of an intimate companion and allegiant) is possibly the most gentle and compassionate of all the Aesir associated specifically with healing, medicine, mercy, and helpfulness. She cares for all especially to help Frigg and the Aesir.

Idunn (Youth), and Sif (Bounty) are also loving, compassionate and generous.

I hope this is helpful, and I'm quite happy to chat about it.

You were honest! You were sparing the feelings of someone not white you are never going to meet who probably would send you a message anyway.

Granted, it cost him his disguise, and his chance to be with his children, for the moment, but it was a cathartic moment where he, and the audience realizes that the game had gone on long enough and for any real change to happen he needs to get serious. 

And he does. He gets a job, gets a place, and in the end gets to see his kids again.

"I would not tell my family about the winnings until I develop a plan with my financial advisor(s), but I would definitely tell them once the plan gets hammered out. I think people close to you, especially family who love you, will respect the plan you have for the money if you're upfront about it and don't deviate from the plan you have. For myself, I'm not going to gift cars or houses. (Occasional smaller ticket items like clothes, jewelry, artwork, bottles of wine/liquor etc. are a possibility however.) Instead I plan on paying off their debts (mortgages, credit card/student loans, car payments, things like that) and setting up college funds for nieces/nephews. It gives them the freedom of doing what they please with their own earned money: save it, invest in the stock market, start a small business, whatever. I think most family members would be overjoyed with that level of financial freedom and wouldn't badger you for more.

"The thing that amuses me about this is that the people who are putting the most energy and intensity into labeling... are the people complaining about how horrible the labels are! 

And the thing is, the labels aren't bad at all. (Except ""throuple"". That one needs to die in a fire.) A label for a partner, friend, or lover should be three things; simple, descriptive, and generous. Someone who hears it should know what it means without additional explanation, there should be relatively little or no confusion about the relationship so described, and it should make the other person so labeled feel good.

""Sexual partner"" fails - it's simple, it's descriptive, but it's not generous.
""Boyfriend/Girlfriend"" is simple, and it's reasonably descriptive, but many people think of it as being childish, more associated with teenagers and young adults. It is generous, however.
""Lover"" works - simple, descriptive, and generous.
""Significant Other"" - simple, descriptive, not very generous. It does have the advantage of being descriptive of the relationship but not the person, which is particularly handy in group situations.
""Partner"" - simple, descriptive, generous.

The trouble is when we as poly folk want to create labels that mean the same things as existing labels but for our specific situations. This is difficult because other, non-poly folk won't know what they mean; by default, the labels we create may be simple and generous but they will fail as descriptive labels because others won't have pictures for them. ""Poly"" itself is slowly being recognized in the wider community, but beyond that many use ""triad"", ""vee"", etc. - and those tend to only succeed where it's a borrowed term that context can make clear, as with the terms we've borrowed from musical groupings. ""Quartet"", ""Triad"", ""Quintet"" etc. really are just labels for the number of items in a set; when you're referring to a relationship, it's easy to understand and most people do even if they're not poly themselves.

"**God’s Angry Man** Directed by Werner Herzog (1981)- Herzog’s short documentary about a strange and interesting televangelist. He seems very easy to peg down early on, he seems like the rest of these guys. He seems desperate for money and is exploiting the fact that some Christians are generous and easy to make feel guilty for not being generous. But as the film goes on how we perceive him and who exactly he is becomes more and more unclear. He’s surprisingly candid and kind of presents himself as a man who doesn’t really want to be a priest but is doing so because he has to. His father was a preacher and his Church is in dire need of help. All of this is vague enough for it to be called into question but delivered so earnestly that I can buy into it. I could believe this man is the tortured soul with a cross to bear that he presents himself as or I could believe he’s a greedy egotistic guy. For the first half I was interested but not swept away as in other Herzog films but then something amazing happens and it’s all good from there. About halfway through the film is one of the funniest and most nightmarish cuts I’ve ever seen. Without ever commenting on anything Herzog’s perception of everything is often clear. He sees and brings out the absurdist side of the preachers show and in one glorious cut we see it all. We watch one of the musical guests sing and we slowly move in on him. He’s a good singer but has a little too much make-up on and has an air of oddness. As he goes on we get more pulled in to his song though. As he starts to wind down it cuts to a woman’s face, mouth agape, singing a whole new part of the song. There’s just a sudden rush of clashing sounds that all seem to be coming out of her maw at once. It was so funny that my friend and I watched it several times. It was like those moments in a Tim and Eric sketch where the audio of someone is layered over itself so many times that it becomes a bizarre shriek more than a sentence or song.  There were a couple of very Tim and Eric-y moments amidst an intriguing documentary. The only real complaint was that Herzog speaks over most of what people say. Sometimes news stations do this where someone will be speaking in a foreign accent but it gets drowned out by someone saying what they’re saying in English. That’s essentially what happens here but it’s him saying it in German over the other guy talking. It’s not at the same pace and the guy isn’t quite drowned out so it can be a little frustrating because the ear’s catching some of what he says while having to make sure I read the subs as I won’t hear it all. Other than that it was a good little film. Not as excellent as his other shorts like The Great Ecstasy of Woodcarver Steiner but good all the same. 

**Cold Fish** Directed by Shion Sono (2010)- Shion Sono always delivers something interesting but for the first time he hasn’t totally gripped me. I’ve only seen Why Don’t You Play in Hell?, Love Exposure, and Suicide Squad, but this was by far my least favourite watch. Early on it is excellent, every single encounter has so much mystery to it that what people want and who they are is always suspect. Characters are almost as broad as sitcom characters in some ways but shot with a very straight way. It gives it the same heightened drama of Love Exposure but in more of a Fincher-y aesthetic. As it goes on though these mysteries wane and the sense that anything could happen disappears. At a certain point it becomes clear where things are going and then they do, with little to really shake things up. Later moments in the film still have great stuff in them, particularly when it follows the method of a serial killer. But it ends up repeating itself a few times. Sono balances humour and grimness well as usual but it feels disappointingly familiar compared to his incredibly distinct other films. If you’re into dark thrillers of this ilk it is very good but it’s hardly the best of the bunch and a more minor film in an excellent filmography. 

**Stonehearst Asylum** Directed by Brad Anderson (2014)- This was the first film The Dissolve gave an “Essential Viewing” tag that I hadn’t even heard of (looking now though it seems that tag has been removed which is weird). To boot it stars Jim Sturgess, Kate Beckinsale, Ben Kingsley, Michael Caine, David Thewlis, Brendan Gleeson, and Jason Flemyng. That’s a great cast for the most part, plus it’s directed by Brad Anderson who did Session 9 and The Machinist (films I don’t love but have some good bits). The film takes the plot of a Poe short and uses its entirety as set-up rather than the whole influence. Dr Edward Newgate, a young alienist in training, heads to the titular Asylum but finds that those in charge could be crazier than those locked up. Early on some things are clear but it plays with what we know in fun ways. Stonehearst Asylum is a straight gothic tale like we rarely see nowadays. Even though it has its failings it also feels a lot more nuanced and sophisticated than one might assume. No where is this more noticed in the performances of people like Kingsley and Caine. In recent years it seems like they’ve been relegated to playing a lot of the same parts; the vaguely ethnic voice of authority and the wise old gent respectively. Dotted about they’ve had other good things but I often feel whenever I see either in a film today that I wish they had more to do. Both of them here actually get characters to play with moral complexity. Neither is just one thing and it’s sad how refreshing that is to see. Even Beckinsale, an actress who often has a moment or more during any performance that is glaringly bad, really captures her character. The film has interesting perspectives on mental illness too, and one that never feels too lopsided. It’s not just a film set in the past so they can revel in the barbarism of past mental illness treatment and feel superior. Instead the film tackles the entire approach to mental health in general and not just in ways that are critical of the time in particular. It’s not a perfect film, I imagine it could have made my top ten had it been a bit more visually inventive and had the chilling/tense moments properly landed, but it really is great in some ways. I have a penchant for the gothic anyway so I think it’s a film I’d dig anyway but it feels a lot better than it could have been. As it’s set in an Asylum with Ben Kingsley I couldn’t help think of Shutter Island and it kind of points out the flaws in this and I think it’s direction. Shutter Island has more of an atmosphere and can be quite effecting but I think Stonehearst has a more complex and interesting script. Some of this could be budget restraints but it does feel like an even better director could’ve made this something excellent. As it is it’s still really good though.  

**The African Queen** Directed by John Huston (1951)- Katherine Hepburn and Humphrey Bogart sail down a river in Africa (as the credits say) to attack a warship to aid the WWI war effort. They’re not soldiers but she’s set on doing it because they ostensibly can. Hepburn was a near perfect example of how modern Hollywood gets the idea of the strong female protagonist so wrong. Hepburn plays such a strong woman, but she also plays a woman that feels real. She’s not just the “get it done” type she is at times and neither is she the “reckless thrill seeker” she is in others. Every positive attribute she conveys seems to be singled out to make the entirety of most “strong female characters”. But there’s so much more to her. She can be fierce when facing down Nazi’s and loving dangerous rapids yet still show intense emotion when upset. Most of these types of characters feel more like single attribute robots so this was refreshing. I had a lot of fun with this film, but not a great deal more. Part of why I was excited to see it was because Powell &amp; Pressburger’s cinematographer for some of their best work, Jack Cardiff, shot it. Due to this it looked beautiful much of the time, very glad to have the blu-ray, but I couldn’t help think that it often looked so much more conventional than some of his other work. Having been so blown away by some of his images I couldn’t help feel like some of this looked just like many other 50’s films except for the setting. At times though his unique eye gets to shine through. For the most part I simply found it a very fun film. Not a masterpiece but a good time for sure. 

**Bram Stoker’s Dracula (Re-watch)** Directed by Francis Ford Coppola (1992)- Man do I love this movie. As mentioned I dig the gothic and Coppola makes it as grand as possible here. On previous viewings I’d found Winona Ryder as bad as Reeves but now I’m finally coming around to her. She actually worked for me a bit better than Anthony Hopkins even if he’s funnier. I’m not really gonna defend the film because I can understand why some people might not care for it but it is my jam. For me this is one of the best Dracula films alongside Herzog’s Nosferatu. I love the in-camera effects, all of the costumes, and the insane scale of it at times. There’s some camp in there too that can turn some of the parts that work less well as the grandly romantic and gothic into something that’s at least entertaining. Most Tom Waits performances win me over to something too and Renfield’s one of his most iconic. Coppola is unabashedly just doing what he wants to do and I love it.

"But my point was who’s inconsistent logic? It’s a straw man to say “well my ancestors were slaves 150 years ago so all white people must give me their money.” That’s what this post is arguing against. And that’s stupid, because no one is arguing that. He’s arguing against a belief almost no one in good faith holds. That’s not really the argument when talking about “reparations for slavery.”


It means “slavery created a system in America where everyone in power was white. It benefits white people through law enforcement, land ownership, political representation, and family wealth. That system never stopped. 

It turned into sharecropping, keeping black people working on the same land for meager gains that kept them trapped there. 

It turned into lynching to cull the outspoken like animals. 

It turned into Jim Crow laws, keeping black Americans out of specific places and fields, out of education and white facilities. 

It turned into mammy stereotyping, pressuring black Americans into being agreeable and docile to their white oppressors. 

It turned into redlining, so that black Americans could never invest in real estate that had potential value, and keeping them in housing that is unsafe or poisons them with lead paint. 

It turned into mass incarceration, where a disproportionate number of black Americans are serving disproportionately long sentences in comparison to their white countrymen and women. 

It turned into police brutality to intimidate black Americans into living in fear to keep them from gaining the support needed to change the system. 

And because black Americans have never stopped being subjugated, it is only logical that they are put at a distinct economic and societal disadvantage from birth. So an investment into black communities to help them to climb the socioeconomic ladder such that they can be born on the same rung of that ladder as the average white American is not only generous, but mandatory to really achieve equality in America.”


If you don’t want to take the time to understand what the argument is for, that’s fine. But in my opinion that disqualifies you from labeling it as stupid or unnecessary.","so an investment into black communities to help them to climb the socioeconomic ladder such that they can be born on the same rung of that ladder as the average white american is not only generous, but mandatory to really achieve equality in america.”","generous, but mandatory","generous","but",TRUE,"only generous , but mandatory","mandatory","only",NA,1,"reddit",-0.24307,"thick_moral_concepts_POS","positive",NA,0,"thick_moral_concepts"

"A large reason lobbying is such a problem in the US is due to the gradual centralization of power at the federal level. This leads to rent-seeking (such as lobbying), as it's far easier and more effective to lobby a few reps and senators at the federal level than it would be to lobby dozens (if not hundreds) at the state level if power was more decentralized. 

Education in the US has always been an issue of money not going where it needs to go (among other things), not that there's not enough going around. Per student spending in the US is one of the highest (like, in the top 3) in the world. I'm on my phone but I'll try and dig up the info later.

As for scaling up the welfare state, that's a complex issue affected by a variety of things, from culture to other government policies. Scandinavian cultures tend toward communalism (look into the Law of Jante), whereas American culture is highly individualistic. Scandinavian countries are also very homogeneous, and, like it or not, humans are a lot more willing to help people who look like them. Tribalism's a bitch to overcome. Americans also tend to support private charity, mutual aid organizations, etc., and can be skeptical of a more extensive welfare state as part of their general skepticism of the state in general.

With regard to other government policies, a common critique of a generous welfare state is that it's incompatible with an open immigration policy. The Scandinavian countries tightly control immigration and citizenship - I believe Sweden has the most generous immigration policy (as a way to encourage diversity iirc), but it still is very closed off compared to US policy (which is in dire need of reform, but I digress).

Overall, I certainly agree that the welfare state in the US needs reform (to be both more efficient and generous), but one can't simply look at Scandinavia and then scale it up.","overall, i certainly agree that the welfare state in the us needs reform (to be both more efficient and generous), but one can't simply look at scandinavia and then scale it up.","efficient and generous","generous","but",FALSE,"more efficient and generous","efficient",NA,"more",0,"reddit",0.5227,"thick_moral_concepts_POS","positive",0,NA,"thick_moral_concepts"

"&gt;I've never had a situation where a player with a cohort has had a leadership score lower than allowing them to have their cohort at their level -2. The score is entirely subjective, and points awarded are up to the DM

The large majority of score is completely stagnant and numerically based (Character Level + Charisma Modifier). Even then, the extra criteria is almost entirely cut and dry, and up to the player or the circumstances of the campaign (unless the DM is entirely controlling the character's backstory which I don't really condone). It's up to the DM to decide whether the leader's actions are considered is cruel or aloof or fair and generous, but the rest is pretty much up to the player to include and represent through roleplay and lore.

The campaign in question started brand new so I couldn't yet make judgement calls on the Leader's methods. The player chose to have no base of operations through his backstory, and has no animal companion/familiar/mount due to being straight fighter. He was level 9 with a -1 modifier to Charisma. I ruled he got the +1 for a ""special power"" due to his unique weapon, but he also travels frequently, giving the -1. That puts his leadership score at 8, giving him a level 5 companion.

The way I see it, the levels here are pretty important. The cohort will always eventually catch up to the Leader, but it will take longer to do so depending on how efficient the Leader is to begin with. It's about balance and character builds. Just like you can take weapon finesse even if you only have a +1 or even +0 to your Dex.

My games also frequently have players of different level, though they've never been more than one level apart thus-far. Everyone levels at the same rate due to monsters giving a flat amount of XP. I loved this change in Pathfinder from. 3.5 because it makes it much easier for a DM like me who meticulously calculates XP. However, I award lots of bonus XP for character backgrounds, character development, roleplaying, good ideas, and simply fun situations/scenarios that occur and stick in my mind after everyone goes home. Also, on the rare occasion that the group splits up and gets into combat, those combats are calculated separately for XP. I like to encourage/reward good participation. But it's yet to have anyone fall significantly behind.","it's up to the dm to decide whether the leader's actions are considered is cruel or aloof or fair and generous, but the rest is pretty much up to the player to include and represent through roleplay and lore.","fair and generous","generous","but",FALSE,"fair and generous","fair",NA,NA,0,"reddit",0.54675,"thick_moral_concepts_POS","positive",NA,NA,"thick_moral_concepts"

"I'm really sorry that this happened to you. You didn't deserve that and it shouldn't have happened. I know it's hard to get out of an environment like that though. Mental abuse tied with the sexual abuse breaks people hard. 

I'm a dude, married to a wonderful woman who is an amazing mother and creative and loving and generous but went through some horrible stuff in her younger years. She definitely wears the mental scars and hasn't really ever dealt with them with a professional, but they've gotten less visible over time. Many years into our marriage though, there's still things that I don't know - I've never asked her to be an open book unless she felt she had to be because it had no bearing on how I felt about her and my love for her - that I'll accidentally trigger a negative response in her. 

I love her regardless of any scars she bears and know it's a part of her for life. But if she would work through them with a professional that would help her, it could make her happier with herself and love herself more and that's what I wish we could have. 

I hope you can feel comfortable at some point with talking with a trauma counselor, a therapist, or even one of those apps that lets you chat with a therapist if a face to face interaction isn't what you need right now. 

You owe it to yourself to heal if you have the chance to. You don't have to bear the burden from this monster. He deserves no place in your mind or soul. 

If you can't do that though, know you can still find people to love you and that will understand if you need space or if you can't do something in a moment until you're able to.

"&gt;Actually, it seems to me that consequentialism and stoicism are vehemently opposed. To the consequentialist, it is the effects of an act that determine if it is good or bad, and the intent is utterly irrelevant. To the stoic, the effects of ones actions are out of ones control and thus indifferent, whereas the intent is where moral decisions reside.

I don't see how we can assess actions without looking at their consequences. Of course, when presented with two choices with equivalent outcomes, the one with nobler intentions is preferable. However, when the outcomes are not necessarily equivalent, it seems to me fairly obvious that consequence takes priority over intentions.

"My favorite roommate was a Chinese exchange student, but a few things she did bugged me.

- she mentored the Chinese freshman, which was great, except one morning I left the shower wrapped in my towel and went into our dorm room and there were three tiny Chinese freshmen who couldn’t speak English yet all staring at me. It took like five minutes to convince them to step into the hall so I could dress!
- she got a free beta fish and then never cleaned the little tank and just let it die in its own filth. It had seizures for a day when it went belly up. Looking back I think I should have adopted it but I was having a rough semester and hadn’t really realized she wasn’t caring for it at all.
- she cooked 90% of what she ate, which was fine, but the mess attracted mice into the suite, which was not fine.

My worst roommate had been a friend the previous year, but living together I realized she was a very negative, bitter, unforgiving person. It wasn’t just roommate stuff, it was petty issues with my other friends and some serious mental health things going on. I kept my feelings to myself and then exploded at her in public, and we never spoke to each other again. She moved out, and the RHD assured me I hadn’t been the problem, and I had a room to myself for a semester and a half. I regret how it went down, but I think it was inevitable.

Another roommate was really sweet and generous but she smelled bad. She was in the foster care system before college and just didn’t seem to know how to adult at all. She never ate real food, just junk and novelty Ramen crap. I think she skipped showers and doused in axe spray a lot? I had to ask her not to spray it in the room bc it was so overwhelming. And then she disappeared for days, then showed up and just...everything smelled. She smelled like she hadn’t showered in her life and I didn’t know what to say. finally I phrased the question as “hey, your laundry smells gross??” And she was like, “I don’t have any laundry” and was really embarrassed, and I had to be like “there is a really bad smell it’s really bad” and she told me she’d left campus for stomach surgery, and that’s why she was so out of it. I guess she didn’t want to get her stitches wet or she was in a lot of pain. But after I said something the smell eventually got better. 

my roommates were surprising but they were all better than more than half the crazy fuckers who lived in my suite over the years.

There was a freshman girl who brought creepy men into our suite that she’d met on Craigslist. They were all creepy and at least one of them was looking for stuff to steal, so the whole suite had to report her multiple times.

Then there was a girl who looked like a Miss America and faked being sweet so people loved her...but she was actually the incarnation of the devil. She yelled and screamed all the time, argued with her boyfriend, hit her boyfriend (I went to the RA about that), called me a fat loser bc I complained about the constant yelling. Her parents would visit on the weekend and would stand there with her door open, yelling and being rude too. She and her boyfriend ended up being on a security watchlist bc someone reported more domestic violence and I’m pretty sure they blamed me for that even though I had nothing to do with it.

I sing and play music. When I got bronchitis I couldn’t just quit, because that was a huge part of my grades and a part of my income. they would bang on the walls and mock me and it was absolutely humiliating and after a while I could barely even look at my guitar.

At the end of it, it was my last semester, I was intensely depressed and I gave no fucks. I got drunk with a friend who spilt some serious tea about that psycho, so I took vengeance and made sure the story spread around before I sobered up and rethought what I was doing. Turned out the story really was true, and although her behavior never improved I felt a whole lot better.

"Last place I lived was similar to yours, I was the only foreigner I saw in a 10km radius for a year, except for a single coworker. The downtown area had a handful, and then there was probably a handful more that weren't part of the tier 88 laowai group, married guys or people like me that didn't crave foreign company.

The lack of foreigners is something I dealt with fine, Skype, Facebook etc. makes the world a smaller place and it's always easy to have a chat with old friends if needed, and I had local friends and coworkers. I had a couple of foreign friends I would see every couple of weeks, but that was the same as when I lived in tier 1 and 2.

Then again, I didn't choose not to live downtown, it just so happened my school was on the outskirts of the city, and if I was going to live there again I would choose the busiest area.

"I think you may be falling into the easy trap of cognitive dissonance, in this case it is trying to justify to yourself why it is justified for others to discriminate against qualified people for being conservative, why you need to hide your true feelings, and blind yourself to how this is wrong in order to stay employed.  

As your supposition suggests, these actions taken against your friend were not necessarily illegal, but they ARE unethical.  Just to jar your thought process back to reality, here are some simple questions:  if the people you work with were to find out your political leanings; how do you think your work place dealings would change?  Do you think your job would last?  If so, for how long?

These are very uncomfortable questions, but I am asking this to put forth the point that the people you are dealing with operate in a group-think almost cult like mentality. If you are different, you are not simply treated as someone with a different opinion, you are instead cast out and destroyed like a foreign infection in a healthy body.  This really is how the left sees people like us!  It is an ugly, childish and a frankly dangerous mentality that has infected so many people and it has threatened to split the republic.  

The folks you work with may be good and decent people with families who are gentle, honest and generous, but make no mistake, they will turn on you in order to protect themselves from the same cult like mentality. What you fear, they fear.  This fear keeps the political powers that be in PDX in a nice comfortable position of never being challenged because the current system will police itself.  Keep people afraid and the ones who dare to think differently will stay quiet.

"The thing that amuses me about this is that the people who are putting the most energy and intensity into labeling... are the people complaining about how horrible the labels are! 

And the thing is, the labels aren't bad at all. (Except ""throuple"". That one needs to die in a fire.) A label for a partner, friend, or lover should be three things; simple, descriptive, and generous. Someone who hears it should know what it means without additional explanation, there should be relatively little or no confusion about the relationship so described, and it should make the other person so labeled feel good.

""Sexual partner"" fails - it's simple, it's descriptive, but it's not generous.
""Boyfriend/Girlfriend"" is simple, and it's reasonably descriptive, but many people think of it as being childish, more associated with teenagers and young adults. It is generous, however.
""Lover"" works - simple, descriptive, and generous.
""Significant Other"" - simple, descriptive, not very generous. It does have the advantage of being descriptive of the relationship but not the person, which is particularly handy in group situations.
""Partner"" - simple, descriptive, generous.

The trouble is when we as poly folk want to create labels that mean the same things as existing labels but for our specific situations. This is difficult because other, non-poly folk won't know what they mean; by default, the labels we create may be simple and generous but they will fail as descriptive labels because others won't have pictures for them. ""Poly"" itself is slowly being recognized in the wider community, but beyond that many use ""triad"", ""vee"", etc. - and those tend to only succeed where it's a borrowed term that context can make clear, as with the terms we've borrowed from musical groupings. ""Quartet"", ""Triad"", ""Quintet"" etc. really are just labels for the number of items in a set; when you're referring to a relationship, it's easy to understand and most people do even if they're not poly themselves.

"I practice property law (land use/zoning in particular) and this movie is BS. The entire movie I was shouting “adverse possession”.  The lead is a horrible lawyer for not even considering that the fact that the specific part of the land they are suing over includes her father’s pumpkin patch which was clearly being used in accordance with the elements required to establish a valid claim of adverse possession (open, notorious, and hostile). Also let’s not forget that even if Aunt Mary had an ownership claim it was negated by the fact that she believe he owned the property in the first place since years prior she and her husband had tried to BUY IT from Claire’s dad. 

The only real part about this woman’s legal experience is she found the most complicated way to attack the complaint of trespassing by counter suing instead of just asserting an affirmative defense of adverse possession. The statute of limitations is 15 years in Vermont and her family has used the farm for the fall fest for more than that at the very least (not even counting the decades of history where her family used it after the original owner died). The offer to settle by redrawing the property lines was unnecessarily generous but understandable since property disputes like this get ugly fast. 

Long story short: record your deeds and maintain all of your property and you will be able to make a valid claim to adverse possession if you are accused of trespassing as long as you have been using the disputed property for longer than the statute of limitations.

"Upon his graduation in the Cambridge Natural Sciences Tripos in 1882, he was “bribed” by his father to persevere in his medical studies with the gift of a summer trip to Istanbul (or, as it was still known in Europe, Constantinople). In 1884, on his own initiative, he also took the so-called “Indian” Languages (in fact, languages of the Islamic world) Tripos at Cambridge. There followed three years of further medical study, internship, and practice, interrupted, whenever the occasion allowed, for pursuit of his private, “Oriental” interests. In 1887 be achieved both his final medical qualifications and a fellowship from his Cambridge college (Pembroke), which enabled him to spend his celebrated year in Iran—for it was by then unquestionably Persian studies that were claiming his main atten­tion. It was this visit that generated the remarkable book, *A Year Amongst the Persians,* which, despite its romantic and archaic title, approach, and style, remains a classic source. It was first published in 1893, after being more than once turned down, and has since been reprinted several times under various auspices (chiefly A. C. Black and Cambridge University Press).




After his return to Britain in 1888, Browne’s life was spent almost wholly in Cambridge, remaining outwardly quite unspectacular. He was first University Lecturer in Persian and then, from 1902 until his death, Sir Thomas Adams’s Professor of Arabic; the latter post was one of two prestigious but ill-paid chairs nominally in the field of Arabic studies then maintained in the university. Until 1906 he lived a vigorous, if somewhat self-centered, social life as a bachelor in his college; in that year he married Alice Blackburne-Daniell, a well­-to-do and influential Roman Catholic, who enlisted his vague but generous sympathies both for Roman Ca­tholicism and for the cause of an independent Ireland. They had two sons, neither of whom followed his father’s interests, though later both lent them moral and financial support. Browne suffered a massive heart attack in November, 1924; his wife died in June, 1925, six months before his own death. The last year or so of his life was little more than a gallant holding action.




To appreciate Browne’s remarkable academic achievements (as well as some of his peculiar shortcom­ings) at their proper evaluation, it is necessary to understand something of his personal position and the world in which he lived and worked. He was bred to wealth and status and was (particularly in his mature years) a very rich man in his own right. This meant that his time was largely his own (his statutory duties were minimal) and that he could please himself in virtually everything he did and said. He could choose his own projects, pay for them and their publication if necessary (as it often was), and personally employ such colleagues and helpers (several Iranians among them) as the university would not hire. But this situation carried its disadvantage as well. If he was generous and clever and often charming, he was also egotistical (several tributes bear witness to his fascinating but nearly always one-­sided discourse); and, as frequently happens in such cases, his judgment could be willful and erratic and the self-discipline necessary for the finest academic work very difficult to achieve. His almost continuous antagonism to his own government and the establish­ment (related to general Middle Eastern diplomacy and the Persian “Question,” Ireland, South Africa­—liberals in those days were pro-Boer—anti-Germanism and concomitant pro-Russian and pro-French policy, inadequate educational measures, and so on) largely does him credit, no doubt; it certainly cost him deserved public recognition and influence. It also, however, sometimes contained elements of the arbitrary and the cranky, and anyone less privileged might well have had cause to be more circumspect. As with most of his contemporaries, all his ways seem to have been firmly set before he reached the age of thirty. He had, too, something in him of upper-class Victorian-Edwardian philistinism: Early in life he engaged in tennis, squash, and rowing, and later he took up fishing, but he had no time for art, music, religion, or indeed for languages or cultures outside his chosen field. His early enthusiasm for Turkish studies soon waned, while for “Indian” culture he seemed to cherish a marked antipathy most of his life, considering it to represent a debased version of all that he loved in Iran. He was no sybarite: Given endless cigarettes and tea, he could apparently easily dispense (for himself and his guests) with good food or wine.

"Nice post, thanks.

To me, Never is a Promise is about Fiona's accelerated maturity and dating someone more immature than she, someone who has had a more charmed life than she and passes through life with less storminess than she -- and frankly doesn't understand Fiona's/the author's struggles and storms.  Like, she had a young naive boyfriend tell her ""I'll never leave you, I'll never let you hurt yourself,"" or something like that, and her reaction similar to in Fast As You Can, like, ""buddy, you don't know even a bit of who I am yet, you totally underestimate the problems I'm dealing with here and you don't even know what 'never' means you precious but stupid boy."" 

Like she's kinda lamenting that he's given her an empty promise that only she see is empty. And he ""can't afford to lie"" because revealing how shallow he is with this generous but hollow promise is fatal to the relationship.

"People are being too hard on this guy. 

First off, I wouldn't even say he's taking advantage of his parents. These gifts that they've offered are extravagant and very generous, but they offered them, and they likely instilled in him the understanding that this was acceptable. There's never anything wrong with accepting help that is offered to you, especially in a time of such financial turmoil in one's life. 

Second off, simply because somebody hasn't exersized independence yet doesn't mean he is incapable of it. I moved out from my parents at 17, and learned independence at a fairly early age, but my SO lived at home almost all her life until 24, and when she moved out she adapted quickly, and was more than capable of cleaning bathrooms and cooking. Anything she didn't know (paying certain bills) she was able to pick up quickly.  

Everyone does things differently. I valued my independence, but it cost me dearly. I was living paycheque until I was 25, struggling to pay bills and make rent. I could have made better choices and done better, but independence is expensive. 

My wife went to college for a number of intensive years immediately after high school, and while her parents didn't pay her way through, they let her live with them rent free. She then lived with them for two years while she paid off her student loans and got herself financially situated.
Two years later, she had paid off thirty thousand dollars of student loans, and built up a solid nest egg and then she and I moved in together and fully supported me while I went back to college. Despite all this, she managed to buy a nice home at age 25, and we both live very comfortably. 

This is owed in no small part to her parents gift of room and board, and her decision to accept it until she was 24 years old. This was an excellent financial decision for her, and spring boarded her into success greater than would otherwise be possible. 

Anyway, sorry for the rant. I can simply say that different people adopt different life strategies, and being 22 and living at home isn't anything to be concerned about. Don't project your values onto him.

"I disagree with almost all of these, some I would tip more, some I would tip less, and some I would tip none. The one that stands out the most for me is valet parking. 

If you tip $1-2 you're a dick. Never leave less than $5 for a valet, they work harder than you think. And if you drive a nice car and they keep up in front of the restaurant/hotel... You should be ready to tip $10-20, again, otherwise you're a dick. That space up front is sacred to them. 

If they leave your shitty little 2010 e-class Mercedes up front at request, and you only gave them three dollars... That means they missed out on a $20-100 tip they could have received from the Bentley they had to park around back.

"Most servers are required to 'tip out' the house, usually between 4-7% of their sales. If a table does not tip anything, it actually just cost the server money. While it does not happen often, if it happens with a large group the amount can be quite large, thus the auto-grat is here justified. On a 2k bill at 7% (not uncommon group amount in this town), that's 140 dollars the server has to 'tip' back to the restaurant, regardless of how much the actual tip is. It should be illegal to work an entire night and be out of pocket at the end of it, but unfortunately it's not. It's a shady unregulated industry as a whole.
Now, an honest word about Valentine's from a long time server who's since left the industry. Valentine's Day Sucks. Period. The worst night to work all year. Remember when I said it isn't often that people don't tip, or even undertip? That's true 363 nights a year. Calgary is a great town and most people are fair and generous. But not on Valentines. So many awkward tables, resentful partners who clearly don't want to be there and unmet expectations, tears, failed marriage proposals, rants about our wine prices, you name it and I've seen it, mostly on Valentine's. Now that I'm out of the industry, I avoid it like the plague. All that being said, I can understand some restaurants charging an auto-grat on a special table d'hôte style menu for that one evening. Sorta like a cover charge for New Year's Eve. 
As for 'fancy' places. Here's the truth, and you won't like it. They know the majority of their clientele on Valentine's are not their regular customers. I've worked in some of the top end restaurants in this city, and the people you see on Valentines are not the people you see every other night. They are people who go to places like this once a year, maybe twice. Otherwise they go to the big chains, BP with the kids, the Keg, usually in the suburbs and closer to home. 
All that being said, you should be getting the same level of service any fat cat gets on any night there. Your server failed in telling you about the auto-grat, and the restaurant also should have mentioned it when you made your reservation. It should have also been printed on your menu. However they know you probably won't really being coming back anyways. I can't imagine this being a thing the rest of the year. No where I've worked auto-grats deuces, just eights or more. I've also never seen a manager refuse to take off that gratuity when challenged about bad service, since it's usually no loss to the restaurant, just the server. You should have spoken to the manager, not your waiter. Waiters in general  are not supposed to discuss tips, only inform you one is there, any disputes are always referred to the management. There are dubious servers out there as well. They are often hoping to get double-tipped in not mentioning it.
Next time simply excuse yourself from the table/your date, go to the hostess stand and ask to speak to a manager. It is the discreet, non awkward way to deal with the situation.

My family is very kind and generous but puts too much stock in physical proof of success. I'm all about organic living, smoking pot, working for the betterment of our world and being the kind of person the world needs.

I also have 7 tattoos. Aside from me, the only other person in my family who has tattoos is a cousin who, has five.

"Well, hypothetically, it could depend on whether the knocker is an AUTHENTIC rattlebag or just someone pretending to be one in hopes of more lucrative returns on their begging. In practice, though, either way if a silent beggar comes to your door and silently greets you by rattling an open bag of miscellaneous small possessions, you should invite him or her inside to share a meal, or at least offer them some generous but reasonable gift to put in their bag.

The authentic rattlebags are devotees of a mystery-cult of Charity, all taking specific forms of poverty and silence vows. They are permitted only possessions that are freely given, and may only speak during specific times and places. 

All being Called to the service of Charity, they are all formal members of the Church professions. Although most are simple priests, they do have missionaries, paladins, consecrators, and archivists among them. 

Although it's reasonably obvious that their purpose is to promote charitable attitudes and habits, their exact rules and goals are mysterious by design. The most prosaic explanation for this might be that if they weren't ""mysterious"", everyone would be able to easily tell who they were and know to pretend to be generous when they're around while continuing to be petty jerks the rest of the time, which would obviously undercut their intentions.

It's widely held that those witnessed being kind and helpful to others are often rewarded in some form or another (sometimes blatantly obvious, such as the rattlebag turning out to have some skill or ability to solve some vexing problem that their kindly benefactors have, sometimes just as vague ""luckiness"" or fortuitous coincidences), and those who mistreat them are said to suffer calamities.

Although ordinary beggars sometimes use this approach to try to maximize their handouts, they aren't usually known to be cursed or otherwise harmed so long as they're ""legitimate"" beggars, but there are a few gruesome stories about miscreants trying to use this ruse for thefts and assassinations and such. If the stories are even half-true, one can understand why few people attempt it.","in practice, though, either way if a silent beggar comes to your door and silently greets you by rattling an open bag of miscellaneous small possessions, you should invite him or her inside to share a meal, or at least offer them some generous but reasonable gift to put in their bag.","generous but reasonable","generous","but",FALSE,"generous but reasonable","reasonable",NA,NA,1,"reddit",0.41095,"thick_moral_concepts_POS","positive",NA,NA,"thick_moral_concepts"

"Conservatives fundamentally beleive that the world is to be feared and controlled and that your duty is to protect yourself and your loved ones from it.

Liberals fundamentally believe that the world is generous and supportive and that your duty is to share the abundance of that world with as many others as you can.

Both of them are right.

You say that liberals ""hate rules."" this is kind of true. What liberals hate is *being restricted* and *restricting others*. This drives conservatives insane because they feel that people MUST be restricted or else they'll act like animals. Which is partially true. SOME people are wonderful and giving but SOME are violent and selfish.

Conservatives see a world that is dangerous and hard and they react by being protective. Liberals see a world that is full of goodness and they view it as atrocious to not share that goodness. Both of those worlds exist and overlap with each other.

Maybe instead of ""spoiled"" you could just say ""fortunate and generous, but sadly blind to the dangers of the real world."" For conservatives you could say that they're ""responsible and diligent but unfortunately they can exclude people who really need to be included or need help.""

Both views have their values and their pitfalls. We NEED both to have a great world. They don't actually conflict.

"Bah.. always catch these late and get buried... but here goes:

I've worked in the Vegas casino industry for the past 10 years. We get the real scoop on what these celebs are really like. Was telling friends for years that Tiger Woods was a PR disaster waiting to happen, which they never believed til it did.

Just some quick observations:

Phelps is a douche. He is totally opposite of his public persona. In reality he is that dude from the ""pretty fly for a white guy"" video.

Tiger Woods is infamous in Vegas. So many stories about what a prick he has been to everyone over the years.

The three big name Bulls from their championship run... Jordan, Pippen, Rodman.... jerks. Pippen is known as ""No Tippin' Pippen"". It's not just about the tips, these aren't nice people.

There are also some surprises. I always imagined Jennifer Lopez was a total bitch.... exact opposite turned out to be true, and that ass is even more amazing in person. Marc Antony was drunk off his butt and bouncing around to pull every slot handle he could get his mitts on while she has to follow him around like a babysitter... needless to say fans followed them everywhere and kept pestering them... she was nice and smiley with every single one of the in a situation that most celebs would have been telling people to fuck off.

Charles Barkley and Ben Affleck are absolute legends in this town for not being just generous, but decent people. The other story about Charles in this thread was clearly a joke.

"Ok, this is tough, because you can easily subvert your own actions with poisoned motivation. You can go out and try to be helpful and kind and generous, but that's all public and it's very much a part of changing the perception of others. These qualities make it ripe for your bad tendencies to subvert the actions, get upset that people don't recognize you've changed, and tweak your ""giving"" behavior for maximum effect.

These actions are also the easiest to come up with: soup kitchen volunteer, do the dishes for your house, buy everyone a card, work on your friend's campaign, etc. All of these are public actions that involve other people.

What you need to do is work out, emotionally. Think about if you wrote this post and said how weak you were, how you couldn't climb the stairs so you took the escalator and you never carried your books around because it hurts. You wouldn't immediately start with ""carry your damn books"" and ""use the damn stairs"". You would start with waking up everyday and doing an exercise routine, then changing your behavior throughout the day as you became stronger, and then finishing off the day with another workout and prepping for the morning so you don't fall of the horse.

This is what you need to do, emotionally. I'm going to basically describe your current Step 3, and tell you to make it Step Zero. This Step Zero is to be repeated each day, not just once. It is the foundation for all other steps, each day.

It starts whenever you want it to. Step one is close your eyes and smile. Seriously, don't smile while looking at anyone. This isn't for anyone to see. This if for you to feel. That's step one. Everything flows from this.

In private, in your room, begin a habit of writing. It doesn't matter exactly the format, but the content should be people you know. You can make a list of them and then next to each one write a pleasant message to them. You can put one person per page and just write about the good times you've had with them and all the positive things they've done for you. You can write about the suffering and challenges they've been through. All of it is valid. But a habit of allowing your relationships to develop in private must be cultivated. You have so much information about these people, you need to process it properly.

In doing this, you will begin to go about your day and really appreciate those people you come in contact with. You'll change your core, from which all actions spring, just like working out. The help you provide will be genuine and not pandering. And if your help is looked upon with derision or mistrust, you will be able to bear it and get through it without losing your way, because you will know just how important these people are, and how much they deserve it.

You will start to recognize that you don't have all the information about someone. You will become genuinely intrigued by some of them and that interest will show during conversations and they'll feel it. You will start to see that some people are toxic for you and bring out the worst in you and you will be able to defend yourself against their influence. You will be able to anticipate the desires of others and become truly thoughtful. And when people are down, you will be equipped to support them from a position of strength, by getting under them and propping them up, instead of grabbing them by the collar and trying to drag them upright.

If you want to change the world, first change yourself. If you want to change yourself, first change your actions. If you want to change your actions, first change your mind. If you want to change your mind, first change your heart.

Good luck and stick with it.","you can go out and try to be helpful and kind and generous, but that's all public and it's very much a part of changing the perception of others.","kind and generous","generous","but",FALSE,"kind and generous","kind",NA,NA,0,"reddit",0.69507,"thick_moral_concepts_POS","positive",NA,NA,"thick_moral_concepts"

"Please take everything I say about insurances with a grain of salt. I only know what I hear from other people, and I am still/again insured through my father:

People sometimes refer to Germany's insurance system as a two-class system: I know from friends and family with a private insurance that some of their doctors favour them over people with statutory insurance, which means they get earlier appointments or more expensive treatment. Some doctors in Germany even exclusively treat patients with private insurance.

I don't know anyone in Germany with an IBD, so I can't say if there is really a difference between treatments with a statutory and those with a private insurance if you have a chronic illness, as in both cases the treatment is really needed.

I know a case, however, where a patient got an expensive acne peeling by a dermatologist because their private insurance covered it, although the patient didn't even have acne. You know, just to improve the skin texture a little.

"The thing that amuses me about this is that the people who are putting the most energy and intensity into labeling... are the people complaining about how horrible the labels are! 

And the thing is, the labels aren't bad at all. (Except ""throuple"". That one needs to die in a fire.) A label for a partner, friend, or lover should be three things; simple, descriptive, and generous. Someone who hears it should know what it means without additional explanation, there should be relatively little or no confusion about the relationship so described, and it should make the other person so labeled feel good.

""Sexual partner"" fails - it's simple, it's descriptive, but it's not generous.
""Boyfriend/Girlfriend"" is simple, and it's reasonably descriptive, but many people think of it as being childish, more associated with teenagers and young adults. It is generous, however.
""Lover"" works - simple, descriptive, and generous.
""Significant Other"" - simple, descriptive, not very generous. It does have the advantage of being descriptive of the relationship but not the person, which is particularly handy in group situations.
""Partner"" - simple, descriptive, generous.

The trouble is when we as poly folk want to create labels that mean the same things as existing labels but for our specific situations. This is difficult because other, non-poly folk won't know what they mean; by default, the labels we create may be simple and generous but they will fail as descriptive labels because others won't have pictures for them. ""Poly"" itself is slowly being recognized in the wider community, but beyond that many use ""triad"", ""vee"", etc. - and those tend to only succeed where it's a borrowed term that context can make clear, as with the terms we've borrowed from musical groupings. ""Quartet"", ""Triad"", ""Quintet"" etc. really are just labels for the number of items in a set; when you're referring to a relationship, it's easy to understand and most people do even if they're not poly themselves.

"October 13th

This month we:

- Ordered my Fiance’s Kilt!

- Mostly finished wedding website. Some pages, like RSVPs, will go live after invites are sent. Minted is great. Got a $50 accoubt credit for buying the premium website!

- Sent Save the Dates with Paperless Post. 10/10 would recommend.  I used a free text design, changed fonts and colors to go with our wedding, skipped the expensive background. I really, really loved the tools for collecting addresses, for seeing who had opened the card, for fixing mistyped emails. The forward to me feature was also great, since my own mom unsubscribed from Paperless Post at some point in the past. Will give it three-four more days (it’s been a week) and I will use that to try again for the five people still showing as “unopened.” The only thing I would do different is put small text at the bottom of the card, “please click through to send us your mailing address” It asks guests for their address but only if they click to view the event on the paperless post site. But I had most of the mailing addresses from family so it was ok. 

- 99% Finalized our guest list. There are a few people we may still send a date to and a few we still don’t have email addresses for.

- Made make up artist appointment. This took some back and forth. I wondered for a day or two if the company didn’t want my business because I’m not paying a travel fee and I’m only having my makeup done. (Bridesmaids will do their own.) But they finally sent me an appointment time and the salon is 5 minutes from my venue. Could not be more convenient. I’m expecting some hassle in booking the trial so I’ll allow lots of time when I contact them for that. 

- Booked photographer for photo shoot with my dad, who is sick and may not be able to attend the wedding 

- Booked venue for after party. Was also a bit frustrating. They didn’t respond to email but we went there in person for dinner, saw the banquet room and they wrote us down in their large, paper scheduling book. No minimum. We can order pizzas and pitchers and people can order more food and drink if they like. 

- Sent silk flower inspiration to my Aunt who bought supplies and finished one boutineer already. Looks great! 

- Bought slip and bra for dress

- Contacted premarital counseling person, who is out for medical for a month but we’re on her radar now

- Made progress on DIY projects. Nothing is 100% finished, which is frustrating 


For April

- Photo shoot with my dad in my wedding dress. So excited for this. It’s hard because he has a chronic illness but this will be special, particularly if he can’t come or passes away before October

- Figute our photo booth

- Book honeymoon

- Figure our what FILs actually want to pay for and figure out rehersal dinner.  I actually love my FILs; they are awesome and generous. But they have been vague about helping financially with the wedding. Fiance would like to ask them together but with their work schedules we often see one or the other. Or there are a lot of other family there and little time for private conversations. But we are really getting to the point where we need specifics to figure how much more $$ we can spend.

"&gt; I've seen people on here get crap for wanting to move out of the USA but not so much Europeans wanting out. Please take me seriously

Right. I want to address this because this has been getting out of hand for a while on this. It isn't that people don't take you seriously. It's the fact many of the Americans looking to get are doing so for petulant reasons. It's a failure of many to look around and realise they live in a first world nation that affords them many luxuries and freedoms.

Yes, there are problems. Yes, the NSA is bad. Yes, whichever wing you are not is radical and bizarre. But the truth is, whether people choose to accept this, is that most if not all European nations also have these same problems. The UK has UKIP. Hungary has Fidesz. The Netherlands has a Neo-Nazi party with a seat in the EU Parliament. There is no mythical ""best"" place, no utopia. 

I know the Nordics are frequently touted as this, but as someone with many Swedish and Norwegian friends it isn't as idyllic as it is made out to be. There are plenty of societal problems in both locations, particularly in Sweden where the open-door policy to refugees is increasingly leading to hostility. Most would not openly admit it within those countries, but many citizens are becoming more and more disillusioned with immigration to their nations. 

True, their social programmes are more involved and generous, but that doesn't mean they don't have strain and problems. On the NHS here in the UK it can take up to six months to see mental health specialists and my GP office in central London is under so much strain you can barely get an appointment for more than 10 minutes.

And, not to mention, almost all of these countries engage in some form of monitoring/spying on their citizens. The UK is almost as bad, if not the same, as the US, in my opinion. Beyond that, many European countries are also in worse economic straits than America - particularly in terms of high unemployment and high cost of living in certain areas. Where some are not, local language is incredibly important and people wonder, both on this sub and in these nations, why Americans who do not speak their language are on the ground there.

Europeans tend to have a more nuanced view of both their own countries and those of the world. It is baffling to a lot of people why Americans despise their country so much, but refuse to actually do anything about it. The abandon the sinking ship mentality is strange to many Europeans - particularly because many of their countrymen abandoned their countries when it was a sinking ship to the US. I do think Europeans tend to be more involved with politics, maybe as a result of this - but it seems to be people want to change their world rather than complain about it and run away from it.

This is why some requests are met with eye rolling. America is not some evil empire stealing civil liberties and squirreling away all the wealth. It is an extremely large country with many good and bad aspects and some pockets (states) are better than others. 

It tends to be the Europeans want to get out to experience the cultural powerhouse that is the US (Hollywood! New York! Like it or lump it, American culture, yes we have one!, is a huge export) or to grow their international experience. It tends to be many Americans on this sub want to get out because AMERICA IS AWFUL AND TERRIBLE AND BAD AND OH MY GOD IT IS SO EVIL PLEASE SAVE ME I NEED REFUGE!!!!! BUT I ALSO WANT ACCESS TO ALL THE THINGS I AM USED TO FROM AMERICA LIKE CAN I PLEASE HAVE CHEETOS????? (ETA: Hyperbole)

It is, frankly, ridiculous. That attitude of disliking your country should be reserved to the people who are being oppressed and suffering actual human rights violations - homosexuals in Uganda, the entire population of North Korea. Americans tend to be so incredibly insular that they don't even realise how fortunate they are to be in their country.

I hope this answers why people do not take these requests seriously.

As for computer science, it won't be instantaneous most likely. You will need to build a portfolio and career. Your best bet is Germany or the Netherlands. The shortage in computer science is increasingly becoming based around experienced programmers, typically with minimum 2 year experience and steadily moving toward five years or more. There is no incentive for companies to take a risk on an unproven computer scientists as there is a surplus starting to emerge. It's qualified and experienced. Your best bet as a junior will be in the two countries I have mentioned.

I moved in a couple of months ago with two roommates. I feel like I have been very considerate and conscientious with them. We were all strangers when we first moved in March 1 but they quickly buddied up. They definitely get in disagreements with each other that I stay out of but when ever one of them has a problem with me, the other one has to back them up. It sucks feeling bullied in my own home. I mostly stay  in my room now but today I am just so frustrated with them. I came home after a literal 16 hour work day that they knew about and I noticed the bathroom me and one roommate share didn’t have any toilet paper and I went out to the living room and asked the other roommate if I could have one roll of his. It’s fucking toilet paper, like who would care? And this is the first time it has ever happened. But his response was “why don’t you guys have toilet paper?” I don’t fucking know, because we are pressing our own out of leaves but they’re still drying?? No, we just didn’t realize we were low. And I said the latter word for word and he stared at me for a solid 10 seconds. Finally I said “fine I’ll using my hand to wipe” sarcastically, and he responded “ok!” And I said “thanks for the fucking help” and I went and got shoes and asked out loud If Walmart was open and the only thing the other roommate said in the conversation was then, “yep!”. Anyways, Walmart was closed, I might be overreacting because I’m tired and frustrated but I want to do something. If I tell them “I feel like I have been considerate and generous but I am not getting the same in return” and take all my shit out of common areas so they can’t use it, AITA? I had the most stuff when we moved in, plates, bowls, cups, pans, the furniture, etc. if I tell them they can’t use any of the stuff that is not possible to replace (ie couch, there’s not room for two) is that wrong? Also, they have been disrespecting my things, the plates are chipping which they had 0 chips since I got them 1.5 years ago until now, they don’t take care of other things when they use them, leave my thermoses in their cars for weeks, break cups, etc.

"A large reason lobbying is such a problem in the US is due to the gradual centralization of power at the federal level. This leads to rent-seeking (such as lobbying), as it's far easier and more effective to lobby a few reps and senators at the federal level than it would be to lobby dozens (if not hundreds) at the state level if power was more decentralized. 

Education in the US has always been an issue of money not going where it needs to go (among other things), not that there's not enough going around. Per student spending in the US is one of the highest (like, in the top 3) in the world. I'm on my phone but I'll try and dig up the info later.

As for scaling up the welfare state, that's a complex issue affected by a variety of things, from culture to other government policies. Scandinavian cultures tend toward communalism (look into the Law of Jante), whereas American culture is highly individualistic. Scandinavian countries are also very homogeneous, and, like it or not, humans are a lot more willing to help people who look like them. Tribalism's a bitch to overcome. Americans also tend to support private charity, mutual aid organizations, etc., and can be skeptical of a more extensive welfare state as part of their general skepticism of the state in general.

With regard to other government policies, a common critique of a generous welfare state is that it's incompatible with an open immigration policy. The Scandinavian countries tightly control immigration and citizenship - I believe Sweden has the most generous immigration policy (as a way to encourage diversity iirc), but it still is very closed off compared to US policy (which is in dire need of reform, but I digress).

Overall, I certainly agree that the welfare state in the US needs reform (to be both more efficient and generous), but one can't simply look at Scandinavia and then scale it up.","overall, i certainly agree that the welfare state in the us needs reform (to be both more efficient and generous), but one can't simply look at scandinavia and then scale it up.","efficient and generous","generous","but",FALSE,"more efficient and generous","efficient",NA,"more",0,"reddit",0.5227,"thick_moral_concepts_POS","positive",0,NA,"thick_moral_concepts"

"Reddit, I know you tried.  It was a great idea, but it failed.  I teach History in high school.  The software offered by Educents is useless to me - the only one that might have worked requires me to use a credit card, and get charged later if I don't cancel in time.  The one option I thought might work was the $20 gift card, which sounded lovely and generous, but really wasn't.  I don't think it is worthwhile to get charged $9 in shipping for ""$20"" worth of stuff that is overpriced to the point of it being cheaper to buy the same stuff elsewhere than pay the $9 for the shipping.  I don't want to feel or seem ungrateful, but I do feel a bit sold out.  Educents, unfortunately, reminds me of those carnival games where ""everyone gets a prize!"", and it turns out the prize is a 5 cent toy that you just payed a dollar to ""win"".  I hope the other options were more useful to the elementary teachers here, but looking at the gallery, I doubt it.
My husband wasn't even given this much.  He was simply told he didn't qualify.  We both teach high school.  He's in English.  I don't know why he doesn't qualify, and neither does he.

Thanks, anyway, Reddit.  But this is why there's no post in the gallery from me.

"Conservatives fundamentally beleive that the world is to be feared and controlled and that your duty is to protect yourself and your loved ones from it.

Liberals fundamentally believe that the world is generous and supportive and that your duty is to share the abundance of that world with as many others as you can.

Both of them are right.

You say that liberals ""hate rules."" this is kind of true. What liberals hate is *being restricted* and *restricting others*. This drives conservatives insane because they feel that people MUST be restricted or else they'll act like animals. Which is partially true. SOME people are wonderful and giving but SOME are violent and selfish.

Conservatives see a world that is dangerous and hard and they react by being protective. Liberals see a world that is full of goodness and they view it as atrocious to not share that goodness. Both of those worlds exist and overlap with each other.

Maybe instead of ""spoiled"" you could just say ""fortunate and generous, but sadly blind to the dangers of the real world."" For conservatives you could say that they're ""responsible and diligent but unfortunately they can exclude people who really need to be included or need help.""

Losing almost everything has made me pretty bitter. I know there’s good in the world, but my family is full of terrible people. The only thing I want in life is to help people who struggle financially on a day-to-day basis because you can’t “pull yourselves up by your bootstraps” as I was taught as a child. 

Some rich people may appear kind and generous, but after spending time having dinner with governors, international bank CEO’s, and professional and Olympic athletes, almost every single person is rotten to the core. I’ve had the privilege of being on both ends of the wealth spectrum and the truly kindest people are those who have nothing because they’ve given it to those who need it.","some rich people may appear kind and generous, but after spending time having dinner with governors, international bank ceo’s, and professional and olympic athletes, almost every single person is rotten to the core.","kind and generous","generous","but",FALSE,"kind and generous","kind",NA,NA,0,"reddit",0.69507,"thick_moral_concepts_POS","positive",NA,NA,"thick_moral_concepts"
"I give to charity regularly.  It's never big amounts at a time, but I don't like walking past a box if I've got loose change in my pocket.

One time as a barman in early 2005 I was making very decent tips one night.  There was a wedding party in, and I knew a lot of the people there from High School, so they were all glad to see me and happy, and generous.  But I had resolved to put all my tips for that night in the charity box for the survivors of the Indonesian Boxing Day tsunami.  It wouldn't normally have been much - five or maybe ten pounds tops.

At one point I said to everyone clustered at the bar ""Hi, everyone!  Thank you for all the drinks you've been offering me all night, but if you really want to tip me then could you please instead put the equivalent in the tsunami charity box?""

Holy shit.  That box never had so much traffic.  I don't know what it is about human psychology, but if someone is prepared to offer you something and you say ""Thanks, but could you give it to this worthy cause instead?"" then all of a sudden they shell out through their teeth.

Of course I never got to see the contents of that box, but from what I kept glimpsing those people must have put in far more money than I'd even earned that entire night, never mind tips.","there was a wedding party in, and i knew a lot of the people there from high school, so they were all glad to see me and happy, and generous.","happy, and generous","generous","but",TRUE,"happy , and generous","happy",NA,NA,0,"reddit",0.84599,"thick_moral_concepts_POS","positive",NA,NA,"thick_moral_concepts"

"People are being too hard on this guy. 

First off, I wouldn't even say he's taking advantage of his parents. These gifts that they've offered are extravagant and very generous, but they offered them, and they likely instilled in him the understanding that this was acceptable. There's never anything wrong with accepting help that is offered to you, especially in a time of such financial turmoil in one's life. 

Second off, simply because somebody hasn't exersized independence yet doesn't mean he is incapable of it. I moved out from my parents at 17, and learned independence at a fairly early age, but my SO lived at home almost all her life until 24, and when she moved out she adapted quickly, and was more than capable of cleaning bathrooms and cooking. Anything she didn't know (paying certain bills) she was able to pick up quickly.  

Everyone does things differently. I valued my independence, but it cost me dearly. I was living paycheque until I was 25, struggling to pay bills and make rent. I could have made better choices and done better, but independence is expensive. 

My wife went to college for a number of intensive years immediately after high school, and while her parents didn't pay her way through, they let her live with them rent free. She then lived with them for two years while she paid off her student loans and got herself financially situated.
Two years later, she had paid off thirty thousand dollars of student loans, and built up a solid nest egg and then she and I moved in together and fully supported me while I went back to college. Despite all this, she managed to buy a nice home at age 25, and we both live very comfortably. 

This is owed in no small part to her parents gift of room and board, and her decision to accept it until she was 24 years old. This was an excellent financial decision for her, and spring boarded her into success greater than would otherwise be possible. 

Anyway, sorry for the rant. I can simply say that different people adopt different life strategies, and being 22 and living at home isn't anything to be concerned about.

"A typical overnight shift is probably about 11-7. If so, then it probably goes a little like this:

\- Come in, start. Find out what specials are, and what's out (no longer available). Find out anything special you need to know. (A machine not working, etc.) Make sure you know who else is on with you, and when, and what their roles will be.

\- Get ready for bar rush.

\- Bar rush. Busy period for 2-3 hours after bars let out, serving drunks and their friends. Most are friendly and generous, but some will be surly or dour or angry about something, and some will be withdrawn and want little interaction. Unruly or shitty drunks will have to be removed somehow, ideally without trouble. (Regulars will almost always leave if you just ask them to, and don't humiliate them in the process.) If there's going to be an incident inside or outside, it's likely to be during or shortly after bar rush. Drunks mostly like greasy food. Drunks are often messy, but they don't mean to be. They're just careless and uncoordinated. They're often loud, too, but usually they're just having a good time.

\- After-rush cleanup and lull. There will need to be a lot of work done putting the place back together after bar rush. This will be 2-3 hours after bar time. Tables, seats, floors, check bathrooms, restock stuff. There might be some broken shit or some shit stolen, or, in rare horrible cases, actual shit. Bar and club staff come in around this time, the middle of the night. They're usually sober (mostly), and usually reasonable if they're not (because they, too, mostly deal with drunks), they're often regulars and reliably good tippers, and usually order the same stuff every visit, and are more likely than many other customers to order plates to share (like a big plate of fries). They will tend to clot around one or two tables out of the way and talk a lot and drink a lot of coffee. They will talk about work between them, but not often with others.

\- Cops, firemen, and EMS show up in the middle of the night, too, often for 'lunch'. They usually eat healthier stuff, and often take it to go. They often know a lot of the bar and club staff, and vice versa. The middle of the night is usually a lull period, and if diner staff are done with post-rush work, they may have more time to talk with customers. Overnight diner staff will almost always know most or all uniformed regulars, and will often give them discounts that are set by the owner or manager. (It may seem like an obvious trope to give freebies to cops, but most of the time you follow the owner's policies, because it's too easy to be construed as bribery. That said, if you know the cops, you're much less likely to have trouble with them.)

\- Very late night moving into very early morning, you start to get a mix of early-bird workers (newspapers, trash, bakery, dairy, etc.), extreme late-night laggers from bars and clubs and other late-night businesses (managers, for example), middle-of-the-night travellers looking for a break from the road, and a number of all-night weirdos, and even criminals (who might work very late hours on busy nights). In one diner I used to frequent, drug dealers would come in around 4 a.m., since they've gotta eat, too -- but they usually took it to go, because they don't like hanging out in places that cops also go. And they're way more polite than you might expect, and often stud tippers to boot; I guess it's all part of avoiding trouble and attention.

\- Starting 4 or 4:30, you get ready for the early-bird diners (the first and usually lesser breakfast rush). Post breakfast specials, which you might briefly discuss with the cooks. Do coffee setups (pre-filled coffee filters, so that you can slap in a new one right away). Depending on when your first morning regulars usually show up, you will make coffee 10-15 minutes ahead of that time. For the next few hours, coffee will be overlapped to make sure it cannot run out.

\- By 5 a.m., breakfast rush starts, with the earliest commuters. Most of these will be regulars. Some will not be, but instead starting their day, maybe for a long trip.

\- By 6 a.m., breakfast rush is in full swing, with a mix of regulars, some-timers, and first-timers. People who start work at 7 will be there in numbers, and must be served promptly. Some of them will take to-go orders.

\- From then till 8ish, it's like bar rush, except that everyone's sober and many of them are in a bit of a hurry. Coffee flows like a river. An overnighter probably leaves around 7, but might stick around a bit longer if it's unusually busy.

They will **not** want to hang out after work, but instead go home and crash.

Almost all restaurant workers eat at work, either before or after or in the middle of their shift when the place is not busy, and get a free mid-range meal or discount better meal, and usually free coffee and soda.

Other staff will include at least one cook, probably at least one other server, and possibly an overnight manager. Large and busy diners might also have the diner equivalent of a barback, to handle stuff like cleaning tables, checking the bathrooms and parking lot, and providing extra muscle when needed.

All-night diners are often after-hours annexes for whatever's around them. On one street that had several gay bars and 'gentlemen's clubs', bar rush was a riot of drag queens and dancers. These are working-class patrons, who have great respect for other working-class people, and are great patrons and great tippers. Another all-night diner I used to frequent was, for reasons I never found out and didn't try to, popular with local prostitutes. They also make great patrons and tip well, and keep to themselves. Large diners near music venues will attract performers and crew before showtime, and sometimes hours after. One very large diner I used to go to a lot had a separate and very nice private banquet room just for those folks.

By now, you might be wondering how I know all this. Besides working diners myself, I've also been one of the all-night weirdos mentioned above. I've seen a lot of late-night diner stuff from both sides of the counter.","most are friendly and generous, but some will be surly or dour or angry about something, and some will be withdrawn and want little interaction.","friendly and generous","generous","but",FALSE,"friendly and generous","friendly",NA,NA,0,"reddit",0.70614,"thick_moral_concepts_POS","positive",NA,NA,"thick_moral_concepts"

I (F55) have been widowed for 4 years, after married for 28.  Been with my boyfriend (M64) about a year.  Don't know if it's forever but we suit each other well for now.  

We have a lot of fun and for some reason he is crazy about me.  He is also really wealthy.  It's fine when we go out nice or whatever, but I made it clear I'm not interested in the money and my independence is important to me.  It was hard-won to figure out how to take care of myself after I lost my husband, and I'm not giving that up.  He says he likes my independence.  

He's very sweet and generous, but sort of unconsciously entitled.  He's a rich white guy who expects things to go his way and they generally do.  There have been a few times a habit of getting his way has shown up, but as soon as I call him on it he backs down and we don't have any problems, just a fun time.  

I needed  a new car. He offered to help, but I was clear I didn't want help, financial or otherwise.  This is the first time in my life buying a car all by myself and it was important to me to do it on my own. 

As a surprise he bought me a new car.  I think he saw it as a sweet romantic gesture, but here's my take:  I clearly told him I didn't want help.  So either he didn't listen, he listened but didn't believe me, or listened and believed my conviction but thought it didn't matter.  I was furious and refused to accept it.  I explained why, and he apologized, said he didn't mean to be disrespectful, he respects my choices and independence.   He said he understands everything and won't do it again - but would I please take the car?  It's complicated to return a car and it would be easier. 

I have spent my life taking caring of everyone else's feelings!  No!  It's not my job to make it easier for other people, he disregarded my spoken requests, that's not on me to fix.  He dropped it. I don't know if he really understood or could see this was the hill I would die on and didn't want to lose the relationship, but whatever.  I don't know what he did with it, I think donated it, but I didn't ask.  I don't know if he paid cash or payments, but either way he won't miss the money. I got a 2016 Sentra. We don't talk about it, he is very careful about buying me stuff, and we are fine.   

Here's why I'm wondering TA - my friends who know think I'm nuts.  I felt so strongly about this, but even my most woke feminist friends are like, ""Yeah, principles, but a new car!""  Someone gave me a whole thing about how accepting it was somehow getting the patriarchy.  Apparently I might be being petty and righteous, and it was rude?  I felt like if I took it, it sent the message to him that I don't mean what I say, or he can get around it.  But one girlfriend in particular said since he only meant well, I should have accepted it.  

Was I standing by my principles, or TA by being petty and righteous?

"February 6.  On this date in 1862, the eminent British Orientalist [Edward Granville Browne](https://www.reddit.com/r/BahaiPhotos/comments/7snkpz/edward_granville_browne_was_a_british_orientalist/) died.  He published numerous articles and books of academic value, including accounts of early Bábí and Bahá'í history, and was the only Westerner to meet Bahá’u’lláh and leave a description of the experience.


From the *[Encyclopædia Iranica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Iranica)* article titled [BROWNE, EDWARD GRANVILLE](http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/browne-edward-granville)...


I. Browne’s Life and Academic Career


E. G. Browne came of a wealthy family engaged in shipbuilding. He was at first strongly dominated by his father, Sir Benjamin Browne, who sent him to the preparatory school at Glenalmond, to Eton College, and finally to Cambridge University, where he was to study engineering or, as an ultimate compromise, science and medicine. The boy followed his father’s wishes and eventually qualified, and for a short time practiced, as a doctor. But at the age of only fifteen, in 1877, his interest in the Middle East had been aroused by the Russo-Turkish War, in which characteristically his sympathy lay with the side that was unpopular in Britain, the Turks. At this point his “Oriental” studies began, with Turkish, to which Persian and Arabic were soon added. He had (and continued to have) little or no interest in philology as such, and his methods seem to have been entirely pragmatic: the autodidactic use of any manuals and texts he could find, consultation with real and pretended experts, and the genial exploitation of various native speakers, who could nearly always be found in England in the great days of empire. The results, to judge by the reports of his contemporaries and his own published work, were stupendously successful.


Upon his graduation in the Cambridge Natural Sciences Tripos in 1882, he was “bribed” by his father to persevere in his medical studies with the gift of a summer trip to Istanbul (or, as it was still known in Europe, Constantinople). In 1884, on his own initiative, he also took the so-called “Indian” Languages (in fact, languages of the Islamic world) Tripos at Cambridge. There followed three years of further medical study, internship, and practice, interrupted, whenever the occasion allowed, for pursuit of his private, “Oriental” interests. In 1887 be achieved both his final medical qualifications and a fellowship from his Cambridge college (Pembroke), which enabled him to spend his celebrated year in Iran—for it was by then unquestionably Persian studies that were claiming his main atten­tion. It was this visit that generated the remarkable book, *A Year Amongst the Persians,* which, despite its romantic and archaic title, approach, and style, remains a classic source. It was first published in 1893, after being more than once turned down, and has since been reprinted several times under various auspices (chiefly A. C. Black and Cambridge University Press).


After his return to Britain in 1888, Browne’s life was spent almost wholly in Cambridge, remaining outwardly quite unspectacular. He was first University Lecturer in Persian and then, from 1902 until his death, Sir Thomas Adams’s Professor of Arabic; the latter post was one of two prestigious but ill-paid chairs nominally in the field of Arabic studies then maintained in the university. Until 1906 he lived a vigorous, if somewhat self-centered, social life as a bachelor in his college; in that year he married Alice Blackburne-Daniell, a well­-to-do and influential Roman Catholic, who enlisted his vague but generous sympathies both for Roman Ca­tholicism and for the cause of an independent Ireland. They had two sons, neither of whom followed his father’s interests, though later both lent them moral and financial support. Browne suffered a massive heart attack in November, 1924; his wife died in June, 1925, six months before his own death. The last year or so of his life was little more than a gallant holding action.


To appreciate Browne’s remarkable academic achievements (as well as some of his peculiar shortcom­ings) at their proper evaluation, it is necessary to understand something of his personal position and the world in which he lived and worked. He was bred to wealth and status and was (particularly in his mature years) a very rich man in his own right. This meant that his time was largely his own (his statutory duties were minimal) and that he could please himself in virtually everything he did and said. He could choose his own projects, pay for them and their publication if necessary (as it often was), and personally employ such colleagues and helpers (several Iranians among them) as the university would not hire. But this situation carried its disadvantage as well. If he was generous and clever and often charming, he was also egotistical (several tributes bear witness to his fascinating but nearly always one-­sided discourse); and, as frequently happens in such cases, his judgment could be willful and erratic and the self-discipline necessary for the finest academic work very difficult to achieve. His almost continuous antagonism to his own government and the establish­ment (related to general Middle Eastern diplomacy and the Persian “Question,” Ireland, South Africa­—liberals in those days were pro-Boer—anti-Germanism and concomitant pro-Russian and pro-French policy, inadequate educational measures, and so on) largely does him credit, no doubt; it certainly cost him deserved public recognition and influence. It also, however, sometimes contained elements of the arbitrary and the cranky, and anyone less privileged might well have had cause to be more circumspect. As with most of his contemporaries, all his ways seem to have been firmly set before he reached the age of thirty. He had, too, something in him of upper-class Victorian-Edwardian philistinism: Early in life he engaged in tennis, squash, and rowing, and later he took up fishing, but he had no time for art, music, religion, or indeed for languages or cultures outside his chosen field. His early enthusiasm for Turkish studies soon waned, while for “Indian” culture he seemed to cherish a marked antipathy most of his life, considering it to represent a debased version of all that he loved in Iran. He was no sybarite: Given endless cigarettes and tea, he could apparently easily dispense (for himself and his guests) with good food or wine.

"I don't wish to give any specific details because these people weren't malicious, in fact I would say there were exceptionally kind and generous. But in general, the wealthy have tools available to them to game the system and they use them. They can lobby for laws and government benefits to themselves. Not just nationally but at the state and local level too. And they can be completely out of touch of the reality of the working class. They don't ask ""what is best for all stakeholders"" (e.g., owners, workers, the community, etc) they only ask ""what is best for the stockholders"". I'm convinced that a ""stock holder"" economy vs. a ""stake holder"" economy is doomed to fail eventually.

All the stuff you hear about poor people gaming the welfare system? Well that is small potatoes compared to the sophisticated efforts of the wealthy in milking the public purse for all its worth.

Unchecked conservative economic policies would eventually lead us back to feudalism or something like it.

Unchecked liberal economic policy would result in equally bad outcomes in the other direction.

The difference is, the further you move to the right, the more powerful the force pushing to the right becomes. This isn't true going the other way.

FWIW this was all WAY before Bernie, Occupy Wall Street or income inequality ever entered the national discourse in a significant way.","i don't wish to give any specific details because these people weren't malicious, in fact i would say there were exceptionally kind and generous.","kind and generous","generous","but",FALSE,"exceptionally kind and generous","kind",NA,"exceptionally",0,"reddit",0.69507,"thick_moral_concepts_POS","positive",NA,NA,"thick_moral_concepts"

"^^^^AUTOMOD  ***This is a copy of the above post. It is a record of the post as originally written, in case the post is deleted or edited.***

My wife and I got married last year. We created a registry at Bed Bath and Beyond with all of the standard “young couple” items - plates, silverware, pots and pans, etc.  We got married fairly young and didn’t have a lot of nice, grown-up things.  My aunt is quite wealthy, very generous, and very old-fashioned.  At the wedding shower, she gave us four sets of Waterford crystal wine glasses and a Waterford vase.  She told us that “everyone needs to have a set of Waterford in their home.”  I expect that she spent about $1,000 in total. 

The glasses and vase are very nice. We use the vase, but literally have not touched the glasses.  They are very fragile and they have to be washed by hand. We don’t want to use them at a party because we don’t want to break them. In short, they are a pain in the ass. 

I appreciate my aunt’s rationale, but I would have much rather received something from our registry, like plates and dishes. If she was going to go off the registry, and spend that much money, then I wish she had asked friends and family for some insight. 

So, am I the asshole for being annoyed by my aunt’s generous, but useless, gift?

"thank you for the reasoned response; it's good to see you acknowledging some accountability.

here's the thing - when you're the person on the lease or mortgage and are allowing someone to live with you, there's usually a huge measure of obligation and resentment involved in it.  honestly, even if you guys were PERFECT (which honestly it doesn't sound like you are), she would likely find issues.  this is because it's really difficult to have 'interlopers' invading your space, even if they're family and you love them and you want to help, and as a result, every little thing they do gets on your last fucking nerve.  so that's a good portion of your sister's psychology, right there.  further complicating it might be what you intimated to someone else, re you having the baby and her terming her pregnancies, but the thing is, that's neither here nor there.

the bottom line is this -

your sister is doing you a huge favor which apparently no one else in your family was willing or able to do.  in doing that favor, she's sacrificing her privacy and her space, which is something you'll understand far more when you have your OWN nest.  as a teenage girl who has never lived on her own, it's understandable that you don't get it, but i promise you in a few years when you've got your own place, you'll have a new respect for exactly what your sister is going through right now.  especially if you're in a position ever to do the same thing for someone else that she's doing for you right now.

her personal lifestyle choices are neither your concern nor a justification for ill-behavior on your part.  if she throws her laundry around and doesn't do her own dishes, that's cool, because it's her place.  if she cheats on her boyfriend, that's not cool, but again, it's her place and she gets to do whatever she wants and if you didn't live there you wouldn't even be privy to it, most likely.  as for her abortions, beyond any psychology you think might be manifesting here, they are not your concern.  et cetera.  the point is, it's her home.  she can live however she wants.

you, however, cannot, and i realize that probably sounds unfair, but again - her home.

my best advice to you is this:

toe the line with your classes.  if you don't have a job, get one.  insist that your boyfriend pay his share of rent, no matter what.  clean up after yourselves.  take care of your daughter.  if she is working full time, which i presume she is, then do extra shit around the house.  wash her dishes too - if you and your boyfriend are only working part time, then that onus does fall upon you, and yeah, you have a kid to look after as well while she doesn't, but that was your call, not hers.  if it were me, i'd be trying to make as tiny a footprint as possible, while being as generous and grateful as possible.  you might find that her petty remarks will decrease when she comes home at night and finds the baby happily in bed, the dishes and laundry done, the floor swept, and no weird people milling about.  she might soften and become more generous.

but this, as it is, has been reduced to a battle of wills - her feeling like she's giving you everything and you're ungrateful and demanding in spite of it, and you feeling like you're being treated like a child and a second class citizen.  thing is, the onus is on YOU to try to correct the balance, because - and this is important - you are a GUEST IN HER HOME.  not only you, but TWO ADDITIONAL PEOPLE YOU'VE BROUGHT INTO IT.  

so try to be more understanding, and more accommodating, even if that occasionally feels like you're eating shit in order to do so.

again, if you don't like it, the solution is to move out and do it on your own. you do have choices here.  but you don't get to live in her house and then demand things on your terms.  that's not how life works.

good luck to you.

"I reject the OP's hand waving about forms and squares and numbers in his answer to you. But still, I disagree with your implied denial of BBs in your last paragraph.

That infinitely many universes make everything possible is a common fallacy. You and I and probably the OP know it ain't so.

But as far as I can tell, Boltzmann and the OP aren't victims of this fallacy.

And the huge proposed sample space of multiverses turns a tiny non-zero possibility into a near certainty.

**Mad Max (1979) - Dir. George Miller:**  
In which Max goes mad, and George Miller doesn't give a crap about how small his budget is and makes every scene feel bombastically grandiose despite their limitations. Obviously his vision isn't conveyed as truly as in *The Road Warrior* or to an ever greater extent: *Fury Road*, but I have to admire what was achieved with the means available to him. 
**8/10**  

**The Patriot (2000) - Dir. Roland Emmerich:**  
In which Mel Gibson and a small ragtag band of guys heroically defeat the utterly despicable British army. Seriously though, as much I try to knock *Mel Gibson IS The Patriot* for its blind patriotism and historical ignorance, I can't, because by golly it's well done. The photography is beautiful (the lighting in some scenes is just breathtaking), John Williams' score is appropriately sweeping, Mel Gibson is commanding and there are some touching moments of genuine humanity amongst the expertly staged battles and bloodshed. And mostly I'm just surprised that Roland Emmerich made a movie I kinda liked (I still haven't seen *Independence Day*). Ridiculous for sure, but I'm a sucker for historical epics, and this one was highly enjoyable. 
**7/10**  

**To Be Or Not To Be (1942) - Dir. Ernst Lubitsch:**  
Yikes! And I thought *The Great Dictator* had balls. An uproarious farce filled with humour as black as a Nazi swastika and featuring Ernst Lubitsch's energetic, un-showy direction and a truly terrific performance from Jack Benny. One of my new favourite comedies, heck, it's one of my new favourite films. 
**10/10**  

**Aladdin (1992) - Dir. Ron Clements &amp; John Musker:**  
An example of an excellent performance/character elevating a merely decent film to a very good one. The first act is typical enjoyable but generic Disney, but once Robin William's hilarious Genie shows up *Aladdin* takes on a life of its own. In possibly my favourite vocal performance of all time, Williams provides an unstoppable force of wildly energetic comedy, perfectly matched by the animators who at times seem like they're struggling to keep up with him (in a good way of course). Without Williams, I doubt the film would be anywhere near as inventive and stylish as it is. The music (particularly *Friend Like Me*) is sparkling as well. 
**8/10**  

**Mission: Impossible: Rogue Nation (2015) - Dir. Christopher McQuarrie:**  
I really liked this on my first viewing, and I LOVED it on the second. The plot is entirely serviceable, and despite its relentless momentum it remains easy to follow throughout. But it's McQuarrie who really steals the show, directing the proceedings with a kinetic energy that never lets up, and I still found it really suspenseful even after remembering the main plot points. The action scenes are sleek and coherent, with too many masterfully-executed pieces of exhilaration to possibly pick a favourite. A generous but enthusiastic 
**9/10**  

**The Dressmaker (2015):**  
A well-acted, handsomely shot but clumsily told tale. Kate Winslet admirably attempts to keep things grounded, Judy Davis is very funny in a scene-stealing performance and Hugo Weaving lends sincerity and heart to his overdone stereotype. But the whole film constantly switches from (sometimes absurdist) comedy to disturbing moments of tragedy, and the frequent tonal shifts never really worked for me. I understand that I don't really fit the demographic for this movie, but regardless of how much it did or didn't appeal to me, *The Dressmaker* is still a mess. 
**4.5/10**  

**Bringing Up Baby (1938) - Dir. Howard Hawks:**  
Cary Grant is a palaeontologist trying to obtain the lost bone of a brontosaurus. Katherine Hepburn is a possible nutcase trying to obtain Grant's heart, and keep her pet leopard in check. These characters inhabit one of the funniest comedies I've ever seen. I was laughing myself silly even on this second watch. The screenplay is excellent, but it's Howard Hawk's manic direction and the wildly energetic performances that keep this rollicking ride as fun and as fast as it is. Katherine Hepburn is frankly amazing. She explodes off the screen with such chaotic force that it makes you want to duck for cover whenever she opens her mouth. Cary Grant is also at his best as the poor soul destined to endure Hepburn's harassment and the crazy adventure that follows. 
**9.5/10**  

**Monsieur Hulot's Holiday (1953) - Dir. Jacques Tati:**  
So it was my birthday and I impulsively treated myself to the superb *Jacques Tati Restored Collection* Blu-Ray, despite having seen none of his movies. My first foray into the filmography of Jacques Tati was a thoroughly enjoyable one, a warm holiday that ends with a bang (well, lots of them). Unfortunately I decided to watch this while tired and mentally preoccupied, which doesn't help when many of the gags require utmost attention to fully appreciate, despite the relaxing tone that permeates the whole film. Then again, Tati's creation isn't really a *film*. It's a world. I think I'll appreciate this even more once I'm more familiar with his style and in a better position to watch this. I still loved it. 

**9/10**  

**Jour de Fete/The Big Day (1949) - Jacques Tati:**  
Being a lesser-known Tati, I wasn't expecting this one to be as good as it was. Obviously Tati is a master behind the camera, but in this he's equally brilliant in front of it. Nearly everything Francois does, from swinging his satchel dramatically around his shoulder to the general way in which he talks, is hilarious. If my journey with Tati continues at this delightful rate he'll be shooting up my favourite directors list in no time. A slightly pricey purchase that definitely payed off.

"I think the anti Corbyn sentiment probably comes from people who are annoyed at how easily so many people have been suckered in to yet another politician who promises the Moon and then will inevitably fail to deliver it when it turns out actually giving people the moon would pose a bit of a logistical pickle. I'm still young but I remember how the last guy who promised the moon turned out, and yet my facebook feed is full of people who are willing to overlook the fact that if the moon was feasible it would have been given to us a long ago by people who see that moon giving is an effective way of winning elections. So, even though I like the sound of the moon as much as the next guy, although I would prefer if the moon was accompanied by a halfway realistic foreign policy, I'm slightly uncomfortable with the fact my skepticism of anyone who purports to have developed a practical and straightforward moon delivery scheme is represented in some corners as a moral failing on my part and one of the reasons that the moon isn't here already. 

Christ I'm only 25 and I'm already turning into a Tory. Someone shoot me now. 

Further, one of the principal purposes of our combative system of government is to find the balance between those who are realistic but tight fisted and those who are generous but naive (obviously a gross simplification but there you go), and so strong representation on each side is important to get the best possible outcome. Even though on the face of it a strong move to the left for the opposition might make the compromise err more to the generous side, if too many people are alienated and Labour support shrinks then system no longer serves its purpose and the Tories can get away with being as tight fisted as they damn well please. I do not think this would be a good outcome but it is a feasible one.

"Even playing a wizard, with all those options of different spells, should only take a couple minutes. So a few suggestions that I use or have heard. At the start of each round (not turn) give them a 2/3 or more minute prep time, they can allow them to organise their plan of attack as a group (i.e. player A buffs player B before their turn). This should help speed up each players turn. 

Also alot of people here have suggested a 2/3 minute timer on each of there turns. If you implement the prep time then 2-3 minutes is generous but best give them that long anyway. If they take too long just skip them. That might sound harsh but after someone has had their turn skipped once or twice they will then start acting quicker. If you feel its too harsh just skip them and say they take the dodge action, that way attacks against them will less likely kill them.","if you implement the prep time then 2-3 minutes is generous but best give them that long anyway.","generous but best","generous","but",FALSE,"generous but good","good",NA,NA,1,"reddit",0.74339,"thick_moral_concepts_POS","positive",NA,NA,"thick_moral_concepts"
"Is she local and do you enjoy spending time with her enough to go for an outing? If so, ""we really don't have room for more physical gifts, but we'd love it if you got 3 tickets to the zoo/aquarium/museum/a play you want to see for us to go together!"" (Or 4 tickets, if there's a FIL involved.)

There's also sending her a grocery list for everything to make your/DH's favorite cookies and say ""come over with these things/buy these and we'll come over on [give a couple date options] to bake together!"" That should give her a traditional mom fix. 

I bring up the cooking together thing because it's how I had the conversation with my FSIL that you need to have with your MIL. FSIL is sweet and generous, but also emotionally exhausting and doesn't really understand that I like my uncluttered home, my time alone, and my privacy. She does not want any of that for herself. We moved about 30 min closer to her last year and she was so excited to see us more! She started dropping by randomly with things she thought we needed. Asking us out to dinner. So I invited her over to attempt to learn how to make raviolis with me on a day FH was going to be out because ""I could use some company and an extra set of hands for this."" And we had a talk as we failed hard at ravioli making about how I love her and I'm glad she sees me as family but I see most of my family every few years, and my adult son every 3 weeks or so, and expecting me to flip a switch to be like FH's family was unrealistic. She surprised me by not being hurt, I thought she would be because she's frequently over-sensitive to criticism or not getting her way, but she was just relieved that I'm not only like this with her and MIL. 

The point of that long-ass story is that timing and setting can be as important as what you say, when you're trying to be gentle. However you decide to do it, and you and DH will know better than me how to do it lovingly, it does need to be addressed. I hope she takes it well, and that you get to have a relationship with her that is comfortable for you.","fsil is sweet and generous, but also emotionally exhausting and doesn't really understand that i like my uncluttered home, my time alone, and my privacy.","sweet and generous","generous","but",FALSE,"sweet and generous","sweet",NA,NA,0,"reddit",0.66504,"thick_moral_concepts_POS","positive",NA,NA,"thick_moral_concepts"

"THE HOUSE EXPANDED. I don't just mean literally -- obviously I had displayed some excellent abilities with regards to stretching out space, so any time more space was needed, it was easy to provide in that sense. We're now into 1998 and this was a year I made a lot of friends.

Mina, Tess, and Ceylon. As I've mentioned, we had a pretty established process of inviting over ""guests"" and then sometimes some would stay, and out of this particular group the three who stuck were Mina, Tess, and Ceylon. I was initially most interested in meeting Tess, but it was Mina who came to be the most important person to me, and Ceylon who became an inspiration to everyone.

Tess was slighty, an airhead. Sweet and generous, but oh my, the best word to describe her is ""fluffy.""

Mina, by contrast, was quiet and introspective -- and quickly managed to befriend Tin, who was always standing guard in the corner, because they shared that appreciation of being still and quiet. Mina had feelings for Tess but hadn't acted on them.

Ceylon was bold and adventurous, practical, easygoing, highly capable, and made her services available to Jakob. Ceylon was a ""life of the party"" type of person and didn't like suffering. She considered it her duty to pull people out of their ruts. While Ceylon and Mina hadn't been more than acquaintances prior to arriving, they ended up working together and becoming friends because Ceylon also took an interest in Tin.

But Mina became Important. I'm not entirely sure how to explain it. At one point early on I was sitting on my bed next to Mina, who was watching Tess, and just felt this bond. Soulmates. I don't mean in a romantic sense in the slightest -- Mina was definitely only after Tess -- it was like Mina was part of my soul that had been missing. We understood each other, we could feel one another, we were very different people but somewhere in our core beings, we were the same.

We were also both missing something, and it wasn't until the following year that we would find out what, or more exactly, who.

Serena.

Mina and I saw Serena together and decided we had to rescue her. There was just no other alternative. She had been treated very badly by her story and together we reached out and pulled her away from it. She was the third part, the missing thing. Again, totally different personality from me and from Mina, but we knew she belonged with us. I was loud and energetic, Mina was strong and silent, and Serena was sad and lonely. We were all sad and lonely in a way, because as much as we had friends around us who were wonderful and compassionate and loved us, they didn't come from the same place as us and somehow we did come from the same place. From then on, me, Mina, and Serena were this trio of people closer than made sense. Three in one, birds of a feather.

It would be remiss of me not to briefly mention the wonderful Dr. Bremen, who came to visit and stayed the same year I met Mina, Ceylon, and Tess. Bremen's responsible for medical care around here. Unfortunately that means he feels it's important to have a certain ""professional detachment"" from everyone, but I'm proud to call him my friend, and he's well-regarded and important to the community.","sweet and generous, but oh my, the best word to describe her is ""fluffy.""","sweet and generous","generous","but",FALSE,"sweet and generous","sweet",NA,NA,0,"reddit",0.66504,"thick_moral_concepts_POS","positive",NA,NA,"thick_moral_concepts"

"&gt;I'll start, for me (PPF) it was a series of experiences of realizing that every single man I ever slept with or did anything with (all LTRs) had almost zero concern for how I felt or what I wanted - even if he did, it was for the sake of an ego boost to himself and not out of care.

Did it ever occur to you that maybe this has something to do with the type of men to whom you are sexually attracted?

Because that would dovetail with both RP philosophy and the experience of many men (myself included) that when we are caring, loving, generous, considerate, and emotionally sensitive people women won’t even look in our direction.  

Then we observe the guys who women are choosing and we mold ourselves into that pattern.  We adopt the DNGAF attitude, lock our hearts into the gun safe, become stoic, and only look out for ourselves.  Then, all of the sudden, we’re swimming in attention from women, not infrequently *the very same women* who wouldn’t give us the time of day beforehand. 

You mold us with your sexual choice behaviors starting from about the fifth grade up.  **If you don’t like what you’re getting, choose differently.**  Most of us wish you would because it would allow us to express ourselves more fully.  We want to be loving and caring and generous, but when we are you punish us for it with the loss of your sexual attraction.  So we learn not to be those things which you *say* you want, but you never actually choose. 

There are *many* men out there who will have *plenty* of concern for “how you feel” and what you *say* you “want.”  They will genuinely care.  But you don’t choose to share yourself intimately and sexually with those men *because they’re not* **actually** *attractive to you.*

Until they are, and you and your friends start sharing yourself intimately and sexually with those men you should expect more of us to transform ourselves into that to which you truly are attracted as exemplified by your track records.","we want to be loving and caring and generous, but when we are you punish us for it with the loss of your sexual attraction.","caring and generous","generous","but",FALSE,"caring and generous","caring",NA,NA,0,"reddit",0.067,"thick_moral_concepts_POS","positive",NA,NA,"thick_moral_concepts"
"There's just so much wrong with this thread.

#Stop worrying about your credit.

You're $40k in CC debt with other debt stacked on top of it, and instead of paying it down, you want to do all the stuff you should be doing already. It seems like you have an income/spending problem, since you should be saving for retirement and emergency fund already. Fix that first, then worry about what to do with your possible windfall. 

Citi is giving you 30 years to pay back $40k, interest free? That's astounding and generous, but I wouldn't want to be tied to this debt for that long, regardless of the low monthly payment.

If you can settle that for $25k, I would take that option. If you lose your job tomorrow and can't make those $120 payments in 6 months, I guarantee they're going to start charging you interest again and you'll end up with a judgement.

Create a budget, and pay your $3k credit card down before the interest kicks in, and keep it paid off. Put 5-10% of your income towards retirement savings, and another 5-10% towards your emergency fund. 

How are you handling transportation right now? Do you need a car? Do not get a car loan to help your credit. You have plenty of history as it is, and paying off your existing debt will help your credit 100x more than adding more to it anyway.

"**Gaucho**

Gaucho (Spanish: [ˈɡautʃo]) or gaúcho (Portuguese: [ɡaˈuʃo]) is a word with several meanings. According to the Royal Spanish Academy's authoritative Dictionary, in its historical sense a gaucho was ""a mestizo who, in the 18th and 19th centuries, inhabited Argentina, Uruguay and Rio Grande do Sul in Brazil, was a migratory horseman, and adept in cattle work"" In Argentina and Uruguay today a gaucho is, according to the same source, simply ""A country person, experienced in traditional livestock farming"". Because historical gauchos were reputed to be brave, if unruly, the word is also applied metaphorically to mean ""Noble, brave and generous"", but also ""One who is skilful in subtle tricks, crafty"". In Portuguese the word gaúcho (note the accent) means ""An inhabitant of the plains of Rio Grande do Sul or the pampas of Argentina descended from European man and [Amer]Indian woman who devotes himself to lassoing and raising cattle and horses""; and in Brazil gaúcho has also acquired a metonymic signification, meaning anyone, even an urban dweller, who is a citizen of the State of Rio Grande do Sul.

"I applaud what seems like the first intelligent comment from you in this thread. 

Listen, I am anti-war -- I was against the stupidity in Iraq, and am fully against any acts of aggression towards Iran. But the past oh, 30+ years of history have not exactly been great for US-Iran relations. I actually love the country and the people of Iran, but I dislike its government and its rulers. I think it is a progressive nation stuck behind the veil of theocracy.

I am also against the Israeli occupation and think Israel is one of the top human rights' violators in the world. What it has done to the Palestinian people is hard to forgive, but of course the healing can only begin with relinquishing settlements, ending all occupation, and recognizing statehood. 

Obviously none of this is easy, and we're not going to hash out these problems in the Reddit comments.

My original comment to you, which started this, was taking issue with you saying ""nothing was said about the pyramids."" No, something was said. Will anything ever happen? Of course not. Morsi may be many bad things, but one thing he seems to be is a pragmatist, not a true zealot. Then you said the Salafis were an irrelevant minority; I provided you with multiple links showing they were not. Then you tried to explain the movement away; again, I addressed that. We are now far, far off topic.

However, I'll say this: with respect to the Salafis/Wahhabis in Egypt, I am sure there are many who are kind and generous, but unfortunately there are also **many** who are intolerant, cannot countenance Christianity, atheism, homosexuality in Egypt, and are not afraid to use violence when it suits them. I won't spend my day sending you links, but there is plenty of evidence that with Mubarak gone, Egypt has become even less welcoming for minorities. And the reason for that is a noticeable and public (and statistical) uptick in Salafi/Wahhabi influence, which can be seen in the media as well as in parliament.

I won't scrutinize these views on their merits. Salafis, Hindus, Christians, Jews, whomever, can believe what they want. But when the belief extends beyond the individual and starts to influence the environment and others against their will, that pisses me off. Unfortunately, that's what's happening in Egypt. I am not just some couchsurfing American FOX NEWS watcher. I have been to Egypt, know Arabic, have read the Quran, and have many friends in Egypt and elsewhere in that region. So take my assessment for what it's worth -- Egypt is in far greater peril with its current influences than America ever was with the (truly nominal) ""influence"" of people like Pat Freaking Robertson.","however, i'll say this: with respect to the salafis/wahhabis in egypt, i am sure there are many who are kind and generous, but unfortunately there are also **many** who are intolerant, cannot countenance christianity, atheism, homosexuality in egypt, and are not afraid to use violence when it suits them.","kind and generous","generous","but",FALSE,"kind and generous","kind",NA,NA,0,"reddit",0.69507,"thick_moral_concepts_POS","positive",NA,NA,"thick_moral_concepts"
"Seems like there is a lot going on here, just a few thoughts...

1. Your wife and her mother have an obviously damaged relationship. They clearly make an effort to passively hurt each other as an expression of the disfunction of their relationship. 

2. Your MIL getting you a gift that was so clearly much much more then she would do for her own daughter was meant as one of these deliberate attacks.  By giving it to you, she sent a message to her daughter. ""I am quite capable of being caring and generous, but not to you. Your wife's joy in this blender will be a reminder of that every day."" Make no mistake that your MIL knew exactly how much this would hurt your wife, and she intended to make you the vehicle of it. 

3. You seemed to know this was causing your wife pain. You also thought that this was a ""thoughtful"" gift. I ask you, what is thoughtful about giving you a gift that she knows will cause pain and strife within your relationship? It was not thoughtful, it was manipulative, and targeted to hurt. 

4. Your partners passive aggresive behavior is a direct result of the conflict she feels inside. She wants to smash that blender. More, she wants you to let go of your attachment to it, and be on her side. It is just a thing. she is your partner. You have known how much it hurt her, yet you made no steps to truly address that. What would it have meant to your wife if you saw her pain, talked it through with her, then sold the blender on craigs list or something, and you two bought a new one together? There are many ways you could have handled this better as well. 

5. You partners dog poop composting act was a way to get back at you since she feels unable to express the pain she keeps feeling at your joy in the blender, and your lack of understanding of the pain it causes you. 

So I would consider the following questions. What is more important to you, the blender or your partner? Given that you have been made an instrument of torture by your MIL towards your partner in using this blender, what do you think would be the responsible thing to do in resolving this? I know many people will say, ""It is just a blender, your partner should grow up!""  But remember that the ways in which parents and children hurt each other can be inventive, and it is not the item, but the intention behind it, and your lack of support and understanding that is triggering your partner. 

This is what I would do.... I would sit down and ask my partner if my using the blender has been hurting her? If she feels I have been insensitive to her issues with her mother? Does she believe that the blender was intended to cause this pain, and have I been unwittingly participating in that? What would help resolve this situation? Spend 20 to 30 minutes just asking her questions, trying to open up to what she is feeling. This will create a safe space for her to share, and potentially even face some of the things she may be in denial about. 

Your partner was overtly nasty with what she did. I think she was trying to resolve her pain with the blender, and her feeling of your lack of empathy. I think you were perhaps unintentionally cruel in thinking that you were innocent of causing any pain, or that the gift was truly innocently or kindly given. 

We always want to be right in these kind of painful situations, but the reality is it takes two to tango. the thing to remember is that this does not define either of you. The behaviors are just coping mechanisms that you have outgrown, and need to change. you have a choice in this.

"Thanks :) 
Freya is potentially the most wild female image, overtly sexual, is fierce and flighty and winds up leading the Valkyrie. She is still gentle and feminine, magical and compassionate, and has a unique relationship with Odin (in my interpretation and research as a lover and partner first in addition to Frigg, as a teacher of Vanir magics-
 especially Seidr, as a student and coworker) and retains a lot of independence in lore, even laying claim to half of all fallen warriors for her feilds Fólkvangr and hall Sessrúmnir. I suspect they have a slightly different focus than Valhalla even while war is still practiced by those spirits awaiting Ragnarok... considering Freya's interests and liberal proclivities. 

All that considered, Frigg the wife of Odin (and it's important to note that wife in ancient prechristian/non roman/greek/eastern context pretty much was a ceremonial title of rank, love, responsibility, and shared children) is usually more gentle, dutiful, and concerned with imagination and understanding of the future. 
She is perhaps the idealized form of gentle, generous, but authoritative feminine principle.

Frigg's handmaiden Eir (and also more likely more of an intimate companion and allegiant) is possibly the most gentle and compassionate of all the Aesir associated specifically with healing, medicine, mercy, and helpfulness. She cares for all especially to help Frigg and the Aesir.

Idunn (Youth), and Sif (Bounty) are also loving, compassionate and generous.

I hope this is helpful, and I'm quite happy to chat about it.

"Very interesting and thanks for the answer.

Here in Canada, many people think Putin is ""evil"" or has ""cold war ideals"" or is a dictator. But many of those people are not very educated about global affairs or current events. At the same time, they often group Russian people in the same boat, as crazy military, rough drunkards with little care for others.

Now I don't really like Putin either and I think he is a bully, but I don't think he is as bad as people here see him. In terms of Russian people, I see them as kind of reserved people, but very intelligent. This is based off the few Russians I've known (mainly from St.Petersburg) that were very intelligent and read a lot, and they were very kind and generous. But they would usually keep kind of quiet and wait for others to initiate conversation, but not because they were shy.

The problem with the UN's perspective on this matter is that they only see the effects of this conflict, not the causes. They can launch investigations with impunity and go on about the amount of people crowding shelters, collateral damage, lack of water, infrastructure, etc... In the end, they can nag from the sidelines knowing that there are people like this (academics, ""community leaders"" - whatever that is, activists) that will accept their word without question whether it is on Israel, climate change, arms control, human rights, etc...

Lifts are [here](http://i.imgur.com/oVdTdOb.png), estimated 1RM's are probably a bit generous but close. 

I'd really like to hit the 1000lb club eventually but I am getting 1.) bored and 2.) frustrated with all the stalling and deloads, especially on the OHP.

I need some advice on where to go from here. I'd like to balance my long term 1000lb club goal with my original goal of aesthetic improvement (which I've seen thus far primarily only in my lower body).

"My best friend is the most beautiful woman I have ever seen. If she was a celebrity she would probably leave all the current famous women in the dust. It's *weird* how good looking she is. I'm a beautiful woman too (if I do say so myself), but I sometimes get jealous of her beauty and how cool and commanding she is in social situations. However she is also incredibly insecure, and she works VERY hard to be cool and beautiful. She absolutely cannot go out without a full face of makeup and false eyelashes and her hair perfectly done, and I think she chooses many of her hobbies half because they are interesting, half because they make her seem cool. She is gorgeous, smart, witty, and generous, but I can't imagine dealing with that kind of insecurity. She's working on it, but it'll be a long journey for her.

I'm only saying this because your friend probably has some baggage and personality traits that you don't admire or want. This competition you have with her can only be hurting your friendship, you both could help each other with your issues. I agree with everyone else too, focus on your passions and try to excel at everything you do.

"Juan 325 of the *Mingshi* describes him as Badugebahala (巴都葛叭哈剌) from the state of Sulu (蘇祿). It mentions that he died in Dezhou. The Annals for Emperor Yongle, in *juan* 7, describe the embassy of the three kings as well but not the death or the gifts afterwards. The annals uses the term ""coming to court"" (來朝), which is more important than ""coming for tribute"" (入貢), since many more states performed the latter than the former. The information provided in the *Mingshi* on Sulu is not extensive, showing it wasn't as important as Korea, Japan, or Vietnam, which all have information. This means that Emperor Yongle's actions weren't meant to boost Ming China's ties to what the empire saw as an insignificant state. What other information are you looking for specifically?

In regards to whether the Sulu king's honors were standard or not, the evidence says it was standard like the Ming's actions in similar circumstances. This would not be the only time that a foreign dignitary died on Chinese soil. From the same *juan*: In the third year of Emperor Yongle's reign, Manarejiana (麻那惹加那), king of the state of ""Boni"" (浡泥) died in Beijing. In the ninth year of Emperor Xuande's reign, there was something similar. Halizhihan (哈利之漢), brother of the king of Samudera (蘇門答剌), died in Beijing. These three people (the two kings and the brother of a king) all received generous but different forms of treatment after they died, so there's no specific protocol other than the emperor's whim. 

There is one more example I found, in *juan* 326, of a foreigner whose death in China merited a description in the *Mingshi*. A man named Li Mabao (利瑪竇), from the faraway state of ""Yidaliya"" (意大里亞), died in the 39th year of Wanli and was granted just a mere burial. However, the Ming court understood he wasn't a foreign dignitary, so his treatment can't exactly be compared to the other examples I mentioned. This man is known in English as Matteo Ricci.

In summary, the Sulu king's posthumous honors were uncommon but not unique. His treatment stems from imperial largesse and not realpolitik.","these three people (the two kings and the brother of a king) all received generous but different forms of treatment after they died, so there's no specific protocol other than the emperor's whim.","generous but different","generous","but",FALSE,"generous but different","different",NA,NA,1,"reddit",0.22504,"thick_moral_concepts_POS","positive",NA,NA,"thick_moral_concepts"
"I've spent at least five years each in Boulder (Colorado), Boston, Houston, and a small town in southern Louisiana called Morgan City.  This was my impression:

Northerners in general were better educated and more interesting to talk to, but they were much more likely to be dicks.  Southerners were very friendly and generous but seemed significantly less...I'll say ""educated"", but what I really mean is exposed to and accepting of people not like themselves.  They were less cosmopolitan, and as a consequence, less accepting of gays, minorities and non-Americans.

Personally, I don't see a cultural issue here (except for the mean Northerners vs nice Southerners), but an economic one.  Honestly, I came to the South with a lot of prejudices, and it took me a while to realize that uneducated is not the same thing as stupid.  I learned a lot of respect for people that I would have just written off as ""dumb hicks"" before I lived around them.  

At the same time though- and this is Morgan City I'm mostly talking about here- lack of exposure to people who weren't also poor, white, christian, straight and southern really did seem to allow bigotry, prejudice and xenophobia to exist to a much larger extent than I saw outside of the South.

So, my answer is that the actual people aren't bad at all,  but that lack of exposure to gays/minorities/non-Christians/non-Americans really did seem to allow for ignorance and prejudice to be more acceptable in the culture.

edit: So, sure, there are people like this up North too.  In a nutshell, the qualities I didn't like seemed to be related to poverty, and there was more poverty in the South.

"That's a great theory when you're the person getting asked out, but when you have to ask people out you have to realize that numbers do pay a large part.  

Long term friendships are the same way.  Think of how many friends of a friend you meet, how many people you've gone to business lunches on, how many offsite meetings or conferences you go to in a year.  Think of all those people.

How many of them are now long-term friends?  

At the end of the day, there are only so many people that your personality will click with.  Of that small (compared to the population) number, only a very small number of those people will have personalities that you really mesh with.  

Dating is the same way, only you're are a lot more particular about the initial meet which increases the odds of meeting someone that you mesh with.  Between steady SO's I think I averaged 15 first dates?  Something like that, and I'm pretty picky.  It just turns out that while we might have the potential to be friends, there wasn't the romantic spark that I wanted so I moved on.  I'm now dating someone that I sparked with right away and we've been together for a year now.  

Now lets say that I had a success rate of 10% of asking to getting a first date (and that's pretty generous, but easy numbers).  I had to ask 150 first dates, and I got 15.  135 rejections initially, 15 after the fact, one success.  That's numbers.

Now add in the cost of first dates.  Lets say the average first date costs $30 (and that would be considered inexpensive).  Meet at a pub?  2 drinks and a snack + tip is easily $30.  Add in gas, car wash, parking....  Dinner is even more so, but lets keep it at $30.  So $450 in first dates.   That's a large number for a lot of people.

"My MIL is great, other than being a hypochondriac and adoring family drama. My mom is lovely and generous, but has a victim complex and has very subtly shamed me about my body for as long as I can remember.

"Honestly I've been a Paradox fan for quite awhile and I'm half way in between with all the complaints.

On pricing I do think increasing prices in some countries on games like Victoria 2 is just greedy and unnecessary and while I'm opposed to that, it doesn't directly effect me and therefore my main frustrations lie elsewhere.

On Crusader Kings 2 I think the DLC has been fine for the most part, I think having societies as a free feature was generous but nice. The recent DLC doesn't make me feel like I have to buy it in order to play the game and so I'm fine with it.

On EU4 I'm quite mad. The Common Sense DLC is truly infuriating. Paradox reworked the game so I had to buy the DLC if I wanted to spend my extra monarch points in a way to improve my nation (since buildings no longer costed points). While I do think Mandate of Heaven was a good DLC, despite not owning it myself, most of the recent DLC seems overpriced and a cash grab for the minimal content. Most things that are coming out in recent DLCs are reworks that really should be free generally. EU4 is a great game still but it's not approachable to anyone who doesn't already own it because much of the DLC is needed for a descent game.

On Hearts of Iron I'm frustrated but not too angry. First off for those saying it's dumbed down- it is. HOI3 was too confusing for me and that's coming from someone who has played almost all of the Paradox grand strategy games available. The game is pretty good now although the AI is admittedly quite easy to defeat for me in almost every situation. Paradox has been looking into ways to fix the AI while still making the game playable. I'm angry about the latest release however as it was simply not ready. The game was not play tested and I'm waiting for a hotfix to come out before I even play the game (I know I could revert). Leaders retiring is just insane and quite stupid bug. On the DLC, I get the complaints. Yeah a lot of the DLC is focus trees and to be honest that does suck. I always felt Paradox should have put more focus trees in the base game, especially for some nations like Spain. On the flip side, the latest DLC is only ten dollars so it's not too bad. I do like the fact that HOI is probably one of the best games to introduce friends to and the multiplayer support is pretty good. Last but not least the modding for the game is terrific. Kaiserreich (I'm probably spelling it wrong) is an absolutely amazing mod and for some of the game's best mods- I wish Paradox gave the developers something. 

In the end, Paradox has taken a wrong turn in some places. It's been alarming but I'm cautiously optimistic about what HOI4 will become and I will probably be judging them from there. Paradox as a whole has provided me this thousands of hours of entertainment and quite a bit of history knowledge. Paradox is a company trying to make money but at some point I hope they take more things into consideration and I remain hopeful, as I've seen progress from Paradox in their responses to feedback on HOI4, that the company is headed in the right direction.

"I don't wish to give any specific details because these people weren't malicious, in fact I would say there were exceptionally kind and generous. But in general, the wealthy have tools available to them to game the system and they use them. They can lobby for laws and government benefits to themselves. Not just nationally but at the state and local level too. And they can be completely out of touch of the reality of the working class. They don't ask ""what is best for all stakeholders"" (e.g., owners, workers, the community, etc) they only ask ""what is best for the stockholders"". I'm convinced that a ""stock holder"" economy vs. a ""stake holder"" economy is doomed to fail eventually.

All the stuff you hear about poor people gaming the welfare system? Well that is small potatoes compared to the sophisticated efforts of the wealthy in milking the public purse for all its worth.

Unchecked conservative economic policies would eventually lead us back to feudalism or something like it.

Unchecked liberal economic policy would result in equally bad outcomes in the other direction.

Bar scene isn't that interesting. Most of the kids go to either 2XS, Puck Around, the Stubborn Mule or the Lazy Duck Lodge. If you're older than about 25, I wouldn't bother with those places. If you're &gt;25 years old, I'd check out Cuppers' Cove (live music), Ups N Downs, Sideways, Lekos, Lola's, Zebra Bar, Limbo Lounge or Scroggie's. I'm sure I'm missing some. 

Paddy Flaherty's, Olive's, Lola's Lounge, and Maison St. Aubin's are considered the finer dining establishments in Sarnia. Most of the other places to eat are pub grub. Skeeter Barlow's is decent but noisy, and Stokes By the Bay has a huge menu. Both are decent pub grub. Hana AYCE sushi opened last year and is really good if you like sushi. Seyo Sushi is good and the chef is extremely personable and generous, but the food is way over-priced.

At home I've always used Ebtech Technologies for an ISP which is a local company. They're great, no complaints. When you call tech support, a live human (with actual knowledge) answers right away and is here in Sarnia. Can't beat that.

There is another farmer's market I don't think was mentioned, which is on Harbour Road starting this Sunday and runs from 9-1. The farmer's market near SCITS also runs on Wednesday mornings, but has fewer vendors open. Make sure to go on a Saturday and get the Vietnamese spring rolls. You'll thank me.

Anything else: It's a great city if you like to bike, walk, or jog. You can do a really nice loop around Canatara and Centennial Parks, that also cuts through the Bridge Park area too. Canatara has an animal farm open for visitors (it's essentially a petting zoo), and also they have great Canada Day stuff every July 1st. A parade and festivities. Fireworks are at Centennial Park.

I'm sure you've heard about Bayfest, another good thing about the city.

If you plan to go to Michigan often, get a Nexus card but be aware that practically everyone has one now and it's not worth the money half the time anyway (especially at peak times).

The Lambton Mall sucks. You will probably want to head back to London if you feel like doing any serious shopping sprees. Don't even bother going to Bayside Mall, it's a ghost town and essentially a warm, free space for the homeless.

Lock your car doors, house doors, and windows. Break-ins (especially vehicle break-ins) are really bad here. Don't leave money or valuables in plain view in your car ever.

"OP you seem like the sort of person who is extremely trusting and generous. Also rich - or just profligate with your spending on your friends!

People can exploit that trait. Don't be overly generous with your friends - it's ok to be a bit generous, but big money hand outs can lead people to hang out with you just to get a but of money.

I'm going to say straight out that you made a rookie error getting involved with a girl who feely admitted to you at the start that she had a crush on someone else. That was stupid behaviour. I also don't understand why you feel like it is your duty to tell your bro that the girl you are interested in is interested in him if you also have intentions of getting with her. 

Having threesomes/open relationships is supposed to add physical variety to a relationship - but if you know that your girlfriend had a crush on someone else then facilitating sex between her and that person is effectively giving her away to him. You might have some agreement in place that stipulates that that shouldn't occur - but in practical terms it's going to happen.

I believe that you probably can't trust your gf or your bro not to have sex with each other any more since you have - with your actions - brought them together. Keeping them apart is actually a bit mean. Unless you're going to marry this girl  you should assume that the relationship had a use by date and since your bro already has an opportunity to be happy witt this girl for a while you should give him a turn since you're already had a turn. At present you're an obstruction between them - unless you bow out and let them be together it's going to be awkward between you because you're choosing to thwart their happiness for your own feelings. 

You're not separating your financial life from your friendships enough. Why are you giving your bro do much money just to play music? Why give him such heavy discounts just because he's you like him? If he isn't concerned about ripping you off, then perhaps he's putting his own interests ahead of yours too much to really be considered a friend. I think you're leaving yourself open to get played by people.  Thus whole situation is weird - nobody is respecting each other's boundaries.

"Note:  I'm not a woman and I know this is ""AskWomen"" but I thought I'd chime in on confidence, niceness, etc.

I'd like to make the distinction between ""nice"" and ""good"".  I used to believe they were one and the same, until I had a few experiences that taught me differently:

1. A spiritual teacher of mine kicked me out of our spiritual practice community because I was always late on the rent.  At the time I thought he was an asshole for doing so, but looking back I saw it had an enormously positive effect on me.  So there's an example of being compassionate by causing pain in the short term.  If he'd been a ""nice"" guy I'd still be a freeloader.  But instead, he had the *courage* to do the *good* thing, which happened to be painful.

2.  I ran out of money and spent time homeless on the street.  My mother was really nice, and would never have let that happen and would always send me money or something even though I'd (halfheartedly) beg her not to.  Then she died, and within 6 months my natural trajectory was to hemorrhage money so I naturally ended up homeless.  I went to my dad for money and he said ""no, deal with it"".  Best fucking parenting I could have ever received.  Since that time I spent with no money living off of crap I found in dumpsters, I've been more confident, more honest with myself, had more courage and discipline, and I'm making three digits per hour as a consultant.  I know it must have eaten my dad up to see me living as literally a bum, but he stuck to his guns and, once again, did the less pleasant thing that was in the long run more compassionate.

3.  This wasn't an experience so much as a simple teaching.  After seeing me being sort of pushed over one too many times, a friend of mine (who I think may be a sociopath, but that's an aside) said to me: ""You know, tit-for-tat is the optimal solution to the prisoner's dilemma.""  I did a little research on tit-for-tat and found that it means whenever someone hurts you, the best response is to immediately retaliate in exactly the same way and the same degree as they hurt you.  This principle is borne out in sociology, military theory, and evolutionary biology.  It was also mirrored by that same spiritual teacher, who once said to me ""IntenselyHuman, if someone hits you, hit them back.""  At first I didn't believe either of these guys.  But then I started experimenting with that and immediately experienced an upswing in respect from those around me, which (counterintuitively) led to more peaceful relations with people.

Now my ideal of ""nice"" is to be pleasant and generous, but whenever I encounter what I will call a ""predatory"" person, make it very clear to them that I can and will hurt them if they move on me or any of my friends.  I think this was referred to once as the ""speak softly and carry a big stick"" philosophy.

Women like power.  It's as simple as that.  You can be polite, pleasant, generous, and loving, and be just fine in the women department so long as you keep an eye on your level of power and don't let it get drained away.  One of the reasons so-called ""nice"" guys don't have luck with females is that their ""niceness"" is actually just a policy of continuous appeasement.  A nice guy, when his country is invaded, will welcome his invaders because he's afraid to fight.  A powerful guy, when his country is invaded, will welcome his invaders because he wants to help them learn how stupid they're being for invading other countries.  Subtle, but it makes all the difference.

You are the result of 5 billion years of evolution.  The dichotomy between warfare and peace has existed since the first bacterium bumped into another one eating the same food.  Don't let yourself be defined by this culture, but instead let yourself be defined by the principles of the universe and of all of human and animal history.

"I'll do a quick run thru instead of doing my work. With takes GOOD BAD AND GREY

1) Honesty: Grey: You should never lie about your height and weight within reason - but too much truth - thats something that is for discovery in person. Telling all of your truths in a profile can turn a lot of people off and narrow out new matches out of your comfort zone because you want to be up front and honest. A good example: Someone wants to only date someone they perceived to be White. They are honest. The person they could fall for is White with an adopted black sibling. I guess it's for the best! You were honest! You were sparing the feelings of someone not white you are never going to meet who probably would send you a message anyway.

2)Be generous but concise.: Good: This is excellent. Could be more in depth though for those who have no idea how to express themselves in words.

3) Use “I” statements.  I think this can get out of control fast. It's not about I in my experience . You are selling yourself so you are out to tell a story. If you read a list of things starting with I in class - you'd give that paper an F. You want to create a narrative - like the note above in 2.

4Talk about things you like and things you want: Grey: This depends on the site. I think a lot of people do go on photos and usernames on okcupid (and age). If you can nail that I think women are game to read your profile.

"I don't wish to give any specific details because these people weren't malicious, in fact I would say there were exceptionally kind and generous. But in general, the wealthy have tools available to them to game the system and they use them. They can lobby for laws and government benefits to themselves. Not just nationally but at the state and local level too. And they can be completely out of touch of the reality of the working class. They don't ask ""what is best for all stakeholders"" (e.g., owners, workers, the community, etc) they only ask ""what is best for the stockholders"". I'm convinced that a ""stock holder"" economy vs. a ""stake holder"" economy is doomed to fail eventually.

All the stuff you hear about poor people gaming the welfare system? Well that is small potatoes compared to the sophisticated efforts of the wealthy in milking the public purse for all its worth.

Unchecked conservative economic policies would eventually lead us back to feudalism or something like it.

Unchecked liberal economic policy would result in equally bad outcomes in the other direction.

The difference is, the further you move to the right, the more powerful the force pushing to the right becomes. This isn't true going the other way.

"**Gaucho**

Gaucho (Spanish: [ˈɡautʃo]) or gaúcho (Portuguese: [ɡaˈuʃo]) is a word with several meanings. According to the Royal Spanish Academy's authoritative Dictionary, in its historical sense a gaucho was ""a mestizo who, in the 18th and 19th centuries, inhabited Argentina, Uruguay and Rio Grande do Sul in Brazil, was a migratory horseman, and adept in cattle work"" In Argentina and Uruguay today a gaucho is, according to the same source, simply ""A country person, experienced in traditional livestock farming"". Because historical gauchos were reputed to be brave, if unruly, the word is also applied metaphorically to mean ""Noble, brave and generous"", but also ""One who is skilful in subtle tricks, crafty"". In Portuguese the word gaúcho (note the accent) means ""An inhabitant of the plains of Rio Grande do Sul or the pampas of Argentina descended from European man and [Amer]Indian woman who devotes himself to lassoing and raising cattle and horses""; and in Brazil gaúcho has also acquired a metonymic signification, meaning anyone, even an urban dweller, who is a citizen of the State of Rio Grande do Sul.

Bonds were kicking butt in the 70s and early 80s, and so this is one of the few times that ""selling stocks to buy bonds"" at the start of a window (the start has greatest impact on compounding) did not drag down the portfolio enough to offset the rebalancing (the awful stock returns of the 2000s also helped rebalancing win at the end of these windows).  In most other time periods, rebalancing between equities and bonds ends up a drag on the overall portfolio return, rather than a bonus, since the majority of the time you're selling the good asset (stock) for more of the bad (bond), and only occasionally does the rebalancing work in your favor the other way.

"Juan 325 of the *Mingshi* describes him as Badugebahala (巴都葛叭哈剌) from the state of Sulu (蘇祿). It mentions that he died in Dezhou. The Annals for Emperor Yongle, in *juan* 7, describe the embassy of the three kings as well but not the death or the gifts afterwards. The annals uses the term ""coming to court"" (來朝), which is more important than ""coming for tribute"" (入貢), since many more states performed the latter than the former. The information provided in the *Mingshi* on Sulu is not extensive, showing it wasn't as important as Korea, Japan, or Vietnam, which all have information. This means that Emperor Yongle's actions weren't meant to boost Ming China's ties to what the empire saw as an insignificant state. What other information are you looking for specifically?

In regards to whether the Sulu king's honors were standard or not, the evidence says it was standard like the Ming's actions in similar circumstances. This would not be the only time that a foreign dignitary died on Chinese soil. From the same *juan*: In the third year of Emperor Yongle's reign, Manarejiana (麻那惹加那), king of the state of ""Boni"" (浡泥) died in Beijing. In the ninth year of Emperor Xuande's reign, there was something similar. Halizhihan (哈利之漢), brother of the king of Samudera (蘇門答剌), died in Beijing. These three people (the two kings and the brother of a king) all received generous but different forms of treatment after they died, so there's no specific protocol other than the emperor's whim. 

There is one more example I found, in *juan* 326, of a foreigner whose death in China merited a description in the *Mingshi*. A man named Li Mabao (利瑪竇), from the faraway state of ""Yidaliya"" (意大里亞), died in the 39th year of Wanli and was granted just a mere burial. However, the Ming court understood he wasn't a foreign dignitary, so his treatment can't exactly be compared to the other examples I mentioned. This man is known in English as Matteo Ricci.

In summary, the Sulu king's posthumous honors were uncommon but not unique. His treatment stems from imperial largesse and not realpolitik.","these three people (the two kings and the brother of a king) all received generous but different forms of treatment after they died, so there's no specific protocol other than the emperor's whim.","generous but different","generous","but",FALSE,"generous but different","different",NA,NA,1,"reddit",0.22504,"thick_moral_concepts_POS","positive",NA,NA,"thick_moral_concepts"

We moved about 30 min closer to her last year and she was so excited to see us more! She started dropping by randomly with things she thought we needed. Asking us out to dinner. So I invited her over to attempt to learn how to make raviolis with me on a day FH was going to be out because ""I could use some company and an extra set of hands for this."" And we had a talk as we failed hard at ravioli making about how I love her and I'm glad she sees me as family but I see most of my family every few years, and my adult son every 3 weeks or so, and expecting me to flip a switch to be like FH's family was unrealistic. She surprised me by not being hurt, I thought she would be because she's frequently over-sensitive to criticism or not getting her way, but she was just relieved that I'm not only like this with her and MIL.

They're claiming that they are oppressed in a way that make it difficult to gain power, safety, and security.

You're making a lot of unfounded generalizations here.

Everyone wants to find someone with a strong sense of self and the ability to take care of themselves, otherwise they're just entering a relationship with someone who needs to be taken care of.

See that? the bold word? That is a called a quantifier in logic. That takes the facts your asserting from a universal affirmative to a particular affirmative. You are not THE world, you are a PART of the world. For more on why this matters see some article on venn diagrams.


&gt; I'm often not kind and generous. But she was all the time.

That is a flaw, not a perk. That is not how animals should work. You either agree with that or that a cognitive intellectual existence is one that matters to humanity, which proves that they suffer from a lower standard of life and never reach fruition in life.

&gt;Did her existence affect this world? I don't think there's any doubt she affected it, and for the better.** Are you really getting so worked up because I think she affected the world?** What exactly is your argument?


Yes.

I have said that many times, that is all I took partiality to. Your life, her life, my life, DONT MEAN SHIT TO THE WORLD (at least as of yet, who knows you could cure AIDS, I don't know you. You're arguing and reading capabilities espouse otherwise, but I don't know the condition in which you're typing so, who knows.)


Also. Worth existing =/= affecting the world

&gt;so, please, enlighten me. I cannot see how your perspective could possibly be better than my sister's

See aforementioned animal mentality versus cognitive existence.

&gt;You're not getting very far doing what you're doing.

Getting far? I don't want to be your friend. Your lack of logic and emotional fluctuation and dependence is annoying at best. For all the things I want to be doing, I am getting far, so there's that.

&gt;I believe you said ""retarded and nice"" earlier. We'll let the readers be the judge.

Oh god, you are a fucking moron.

fool, idiot, dumb, retarded, mentally disabled, mentally deficient, LD, all of these were correct at one time. Your getting your panties in a bunch because of the usage of a nondemeaning, noninflammatory, nondenigrating word that is no longer considered politically correct. You're joking me right? If I were to call someone from palestine Arabic am I mocking them? Am I somehow devaluing them? No, it's just not the politically correct term, and the intent behind the word should dictate offense.

&gt;Then what are you trying to say? If you think they're valuable, then they do affect the world? I think you're twisting yourself a knot, here.

No I'm not? See the word most in my sentence (quantifiers again, oh joy!)? Yeah, most people don't mean shit to the world either.
Also value to society, specifically personal structures does not equate any effect on the world.

"I reject the OP's hand waving about forms and squares and numbers in his answer to you. But still, I disagree with your implied denial of BBs in your last paragraph.

That infinitely many universes make everything possible is a common fallacy. You and I and probably the OP know it ain't so.

But as far as I can tell, Boltzmann and the OP aren't victims of this fallacy. They are talking about an event that is apparently possible (with a very tiny but non-zero probability) at least in theory. And the huge proposed sample space of multiverses turns a tiny non-zero possibility into a near certainty.

His other implied premise, that you attack in your first paragraph, is that deities are a fairly broad class of entities which are, for whatever reasons, so much more powerful and knowledgeable than we that what they do is to us indistinguishable from magic, or ""the supernatural."" I can live with calling that kind of hypothetical being a deity. It comes down to what you want to consider ""as normally defined.""

"My mother's mom suffered depression and was extremely emotionally/physically abusive toward my mother. She was consistently told that she was ugly, nobody wanted her, and my mom has a variety of scars all over her from having knives thrown at her, being beaten with the buckled end of a belt, etc.  Still, my mom stuck around and took care of my grandmother till the bitter end, stopping by to visit her and do her laundry, clean up her house, etc.

My mom is a great woman who is very gentle and generous.  But I'm not going to lie; this experience with her mother made her weird.

"Grand purpose... of course I have a vision.  There are private and public aspects to my vision.  There are aspects which relate to humanity and those which transcend it.

Now, your grandpa here is tired of a power imbalance, and of the irresponsible, ignorant, crass and petty economic elites.  Therefore on the strength of my own wisdom and power, I am guiding this manifestation toward a democracy.  Now, when I say ""democracy"" it doesn't mean anything goes.  After all, I won't have a democratic vote on whether or not we should have a democracy, so right there I have a noble intent.

Why would your grandpa want a democracy, you ask?  It's simple.  I want a decent self-regulating system so that I am free to do things in my life besides governance.  If I consolidate all the overt power in my own hands in a public way, I will become married to the art of governance in a way which will leave me unable to step away from it.  On the other hand, suppose I allow a friend of mine to consolidate political power in this way.  Then I'll always have to worry about this friend, with so much power consolidation, turning against me especially while I am not looking, which of course I don't want to be.  The more consolidated power is in the hands of one or a few individuals, the more subject to a personal whim it becomes.  I want something a bit more stable than that.  And I want something that responds to the needs of the people, not because I am so kind and generous, but because when I disappear from the public eye and ""do my own thing"" I'll act as one of the people, so how a random person gets treated by the system is how I myself will be treated.  I cannot allow this grandpa of yours here to be mistreated under any circumstances.  And I want to live incognito.  1+1=2.  It means I need a system that treats everyone well so that I can then disappear into it.  That means everyone must have a political voice of some sort, including having a voice with regard to public policy.  Without that voice public policy will inevitably run away from some section of the population.

Anyone who tampers with this grandpa's democracy is my, your grandpa's, enemy.  Anyone who postpones elections (I'm looking at you, Scott boy) or spreads any kind of democracy-skeptical bullshit is my enemy.  Even the fact that the corporations are not run democratically by the workers who work there is already against my interests, especially if we're talking about large corporations with large power consolidations.  My absolute bare minimum is the Codetermination model used by the Germans.

I also want less war.

I want more religious tolerance, which ironically means I cannot tolerate the intolerant doctrinal elements of some religions.

Finally, eventually I will want to get off this planet, because I like exploring instead of sitting around on a fully mapped out and well understood planet.  Of course if everyone is busy picking up soda cans just to survive and fighting a bunch of meaningless conflicts, the amount of progress toward space travel is going to be very limited.  This conflicts with your grandpas desire to leave this planet.

So far I've mentioned a few things as they pertain to the public side of humanity.  Of course there is more to it than that, but that's for me to know and for anyone else to guess.

What I recommend is that you don't worry too much about what I want and become a sublime knower, master, and steward of your own perspective.

&gt;
&gt;I was 17 when our marriage was arranged and he brought me here. I didn't speak very much english. He took my passport and papers. He treated me like a servant. Never let me go out or work or talk to anybody. He didn't even allowed a phone in the house, only his cell phone.
&gt;
&gt;Only when our daughters were born I got to work because he was too cheap to pay for shoes and clothes with ""his"" money for ""just girls"", even though he is very rich and I was working minimum wage.
&gt;
&gt;And now, he is dying. I don't care even a little. I go to the hospital every day to see him. Everyone thinks I am so good wife, but I am only checking that he is still dying. He is in pain.

Merkel is simply being cruel here, knowing as she does that that delusion carries massive political currency.

"Well I think some other people would have more to contribute as far as ""proper"" meal plans for keto, but here's what I've been doing (in general, this is just an average day for me). 

Firstly, I try to make the volume of leafy greens equate the volume of protein (not mass, mind you: just filling up at least half of my plate with romaine, spinach, or kale). 

My favorite breakfast is a bowl of romaine lettuce (as much lettuce as maybe 150% the size of my fist) with some (generous, but conscious of the caloric intake) blue cheese dressing. I cut up half a meduim Hass avocado (they're 50c at the store here in TX) and top the salad. Then a drizzling of sriracha. Then 3 sunny side up eggs laid over it (surprisingly, the yolk tastes great over this salad). Then.... BACON (3-5 slices). Usually this comes out to ~800 calories and constitutes the majority of my daily calories. I can't finish it. Maybe I should cut an egg and some bacon out of it. The bowl just looks so ***manly***, though, with all that awesome shit on it. 

My lunch is the romaine or spinach salad (same liberal amount of greens, maybe a different style dressing) with sides of deli meats and cheeses (mostly paying attention to the amount of calories). Sometimes I grab a cheddar jalapeno sausage (or something of the like) instead of the meats and cheeses (making sure to get fat in there). Usually between 400-500 cals. usually I can finish this, but sometimes I can't. 

My dinner is a salad of the same sort (different dressings, maybe, but still greens and such). If I feel I've been slacking on my fat intake, I throw bacon on it (or just have bacon strips with dinner). Then a pork chop (we just have a lot of pork right now), but I'd gladly do a steak, chicken, or venison in place of this. I'd assume this hits about 700-800 cal, but I never finish all my meals, so I'm not worried about it. This is about an hour after I finish my workout, so I eat between 5-6 pm. 

I work out 5x a week for about 2 hr/day. I'm stuffed ALL THE TIME, and still don't hit 2000 calories (usually). I've lost 6 pounds in 3 days and have been slamming myself in the gym, seeing large percentage gains similar to the post. I'm still running 1.5 hrs a week and not seeing a lull in energy. My lifting has *felt* weaker, but the numbers are speaking for themselves in my opinion, so I'm not sweating it. 

As for the ""plan"", just do two things: cut out sugars and starchy carbs (any carbs you get should probably come from your leafy greens and have plenty of fiber) and make sure you get plenty of fat and protein. I'm not even counting calories anymore, because I found that if I actually *ate* 2000 calories on this plan, I'd never stop shitting. I literally can't eat that much, and I'm a fat kid. Yesterday I went to BJ's Brewhouse and had the Grilled Pork Chops with double veggies (~900 calories). I devoured it (I just got back from a 3 hour workout; I had missed a day) and immediately wanted to throw up. It was just 2 pork chops with maybe 4-6 oz of steamed veggies. It's so easy to cut calories and keep your protein up on this shit. I'm ecstatic about how easy it is to be full on this diet.

"Midwesterner who moved to CT here!

People think you're snooty because Connecticut has a culture that is drastically different from the rest of the country.  CT is very fast paced.  People drive fast, food service is fast, checkout lines are fast.  Everywhere else I've lived has been considerably slower.  It's something you get used to real quick (I loved it), but it makes Nutmeggers seem impatient in other places.  Another big difference is that people interact is a much different way.  Politeness is not measured by the conversation you have with the guy at the gas station while getting some smokes, nor do you say please/thank you/etc. with the same frequency as other parts of the country.

"Leo Sun, Sagittarius Moon, Aquarius Rising.

I'm definitely a lot like Leo, except I don't *need* to be the center of attention all the time, and I'm very introverted. I am prideful, though, super loyal, I like putting effort into my appearance, I'm ambitious, creative, generous, but also stubborn, selective, arrogant, and fairly lazy with things I don't want to do/don't care about.

Sagittarius Moon describes me pretty well too. I love my freedom, and I love learning and travelling. I also have a huge tendency of needing to be right, but I'm also open minded too.

Aquarius Rising fits me as well. Again, I'm intelligent and creative, and also independent. At the same time though, I'm reserved, and can be hedonistic. However, I'm not really enthusiastic or energetic.

The combo fits my personality very well, though I would say the glaring difference is that I'm not loud, or a partier, or always trying to be the center of attention. I'm an INTJ as well, so I like to do my own thing, learn, create, travel, etc. which is a huge facet of my combo. Interestingly, INTJs are full of contradictions, and so are Leos, as well. I simultaneously think I'm the best thing in the world, but I also kind of hate myself (on a self deprecating humor type level). I'm extremely liberal and open minded, but I'm quick to judge people who I feel don't live up to my (admittedly, incredibly high) standards. I love learning and listening to people's stories, but I like being by myself in my own quiet bubble. I tend to view me showing emotion as a sign of weakness, yet I feel emotions more strongly than anyone I know.

I'm really into the whole zodiac/MBTI type stuff, so this was fun!

"&gt;This place has been losing subscribers since we were a default. 

And what were things like before that?  What's the real issue; does being ""a default"" necessitate a loss of membership?  How to other defaults deal with it?  If what you're saying is true, it seems that all defaults should eventually wither away and fail after becoming defaults.  Is this the case?

&gt;Only now since we are not a default can you actually see the trend because the number are not actually inflated.

If you were losing membership before and are losing membership now, when did you ever gain followers?  These statements you're making aren't adding up.  

&gt;I give the users full credit for that. Any attempts to moderate this place has been met with extreme pushback and honestly there's only so much mods can do to help a subreddit , especially one with a community as hostile and toxic as this one.

The moment you start calling your customers names is the moment things start going downhill faster.  Of course people will be angry if you censor them.  But if you ignore the commentary, delete the offending posts, and remove repeat offenders, there shouldn't be any vitriol to speak of.  Beyond the background level of new users, of course.  And those weirdos who just make new accounts...I had to deal with one of them on a facebook group.  After a few years of a new account ever day or so, he gave up.  Meh.  If you can see folks' IPs somehow, it would be easier.  

&gt;If you noticed, we've had this sticky up for about a week and a half asking for more mods so clearly we are getting more mods, 

I'd say that's a bit generous, but sure.  You'll get plenty of mods.  

&gt;but there is only so much we can do here while the community downvotes every opinion that isn't exactly like theirs and gets into flame wars with people all the time. 

So it's a democracy, you say?  If I post something unpopular on imgur, I expect to be downvoted.  Why do you think this convention is a bad one?  It selects items that more people will find more interesting and pushes them to the top.  Being open-minded is good, but this isn't BBC or an AP website.  This is a social site.  You have to let folks do what they want to, to a reasonable extent.  

&gt;That turns people away much more than the mods and the rules (both of which most people barely realize exist). Opinion downvoting is over reaching censorship and the mods have nothing to do with that.

Sounds reasonable to me.  Every site seems to be like this nowadays, with various ""news"" webpages and blogs in which all/most of the commenters are one side versus another.  That's the way social sites work; they attract a particular crowd.  That's why it's a social network, and not a...formal debate forum.  In all honesty, the latter sounds like a much better place to have a political discussion, but I've yet to find such a place anywhere on the internet.  Shame.

"I just read Oscar Wilde's 'The Soul of Man..."" and he makes a pretty convincing argument against charity of this sort. He says charity only patches a broken system and keeps it going for longer. 

These guys are giving half of the wealth they have, wealth amounting to probably something like ten-thousand times as much as any single man would need to live comfortably in a lifetime. 

So a bunch of people will suffer a little bit less, perhaps some breakthroughs will occur that wouldn't have otherwise, and that's fantastic and generous. But the basic system will remain the same: a select, lucky few will have the vast majority of the wealth and power, and the vast majority of the people will live paycheck to paycheck, wondering when their day will come. 

Call me cynical but I think the billionaires' charity is best for them, it'll go a long way in preserving the inequality that has benefitted them so much and that many less people will feel motivated to get behind something that could be better for all of us.

"Note:  I'm not a woman and I know this is ""AskWomen"" but I thought I'd chime in on confidence, niceness, etc.

I'd like to make the distinction between ""nice"" and ""good"".  I used to believe they were one and the same, until I had a few experiences that taught me differently:

1. A spiritual teacher of mine kicked me out of our spiritual practice community because I was always late on the rent.  At the time I thought he was an asshole for doing so, but looking back I saw it had an enormously positive effect on me.  So there's an example of being compassionate by causing pain in the short term.  If he'd been a ""nice"" guy I'd still be a freeloader.  But instead, he had the *courage* to do the *good* thing, which happened to be painful.

2.  I ran out of money and spent time homeless on the street.  My mother was really nice, and would never have let that happen and would always send me money or something even though I'd (halfheartedly) beg her not to.  Then she died, and within 6 months my natural trajectory was to hemorrhage money so I naturally ended up homeless.  I went to my dad for money and he said ""no, deal with it"".  Best fucking parenting I could have ever received.  Since that time I spent with no money living off of crap I found in dumpsters, I've been more confident, more honest with myself, had more courage and discipline, and I'm making three digits per hour as a consultant.  I know it must have eaten my dad up to see me living as literally a bum, but he stuck to his guns and, once again, did the less pleasant thing that was in the long run more compassionate.

3.  This wasn't an experience so much as a simple teaching.  After seeing me being sort of pushed over one too many times, a friend of mine (who I think may be a sociopath, but that's an aside) said to me: ""You know, tit-for-tat is the optimal solution to the prisoner's dilemma.""  I did a little research on tit-for-tat and found that it means whenever someone hurts you, the best response is to immediately retaliate in exactly the same way and the same degree as they hurt you.  This principle is borne out in sociology, military theory, and evolutionary biology.  It was also mirrored by that same spiritual teacher, who once said to me ""IntenselyHuman, if someone hits you, hit them back.""  At first I didn't believe either of these guys.  But then I started experimenting with that and immediately experienced an upswing in respect from those around me, which (counterintuitively) led to more peaceful relations with people.

Now my ideal of ""nice"" is to be pleasant and generous, but whenever I encounter what I will call a ""predatory"" person, make it very clear to them that I can and will hurt them if they move on me or any of my friends.  I think this was referred to once as the ""speak softly and carry a big stick"" philosophy.

Women like power.  It's as simple as that.  You can be polite, pleasant, generous, and loving, and be just fine in the women department so long as you keep an eye on your level of power and don't let it get drained away.  One of the reasons so-called ""nice"" guys don't have luck with females is that their ""niceness"" is actually just a policy of continuous appeasement.  A nice guy, when his country is invaded, will welcome his invaders because he's afraid to fight.  A powerful guy, when his country is invaded, will welcome his invaders because he wants to help them learn how stupid they're being for invading other countries.  Subtle, but it makes all the difference.

You are the result of 5 billion years of evolution.  The dichotomy between warfare and peace has existed since the first bacterium bumped into another one eating the same food.  Don't let yourself be defined by this culture, but instead let yourself be defined by the principles of the universe and of all of human and animal history.

"I practice property law (land use/zoning in particular) and this movie is BS. The entire movie I was shouting “adverse possession”.  The lead is a horrible lawyer for not even considering that the fact that the specific part of the land they are suing over includes her father’s pumpkin patch which was clearly being used in accordance with the elements required to establish a valid claim of adverse possession (open, notorious, and hostile). Also let’s not forget that even if Aunt Mary had an ownership claim it was negated by the fact that she believe he owned the property in the first place since years prior she and her husband had tried to BUY IT from Claire’s dad. 

The only real part about this woman’s legal experience is she found the most complicated way to attack the complaint of trespassing by counter suing instead of just asserting an affirmative defense of adverse possession. The statute of limitations is 15 years in Vermont and her family has used the farm for the fall fest for more than that at the very least (not even counting the decades of history where her family used it after the original owner died). The offer to settle by redrawing the property lines was unnecessarily generous but understandable since property disputes like this get ugly fast. 

Long story short: record your deeds and maintain all of your property and you will be able to make a valid claim to adverse possession if you are accused of trespassing as long as you have been using the disputed property for longer than the statute of limitations.

Years ago, when Mike Tyson fought some hapless moron on pay-per-view, I went to a theatre party in NYC to watch it.  It was being thrown by a chorus person in a Broadway show that happened to be starring Sarah Jessica Parker.  She and Matthew Broderick happened to show up to the party and we sat next to each other on the floor.  We hurled snarky comments at the screen together for the ten minutes that we were seated (Tyson dispatched the guy in a minute and a half).  Very funny people, I thought.

As for the other people I've met, it depends on what you consider fame.  To me, some of them were very important.

Robyn Hitchcock--twice.  Talked with him and the Egyptians after a show in '93.  Bantered with him about what make of cheese grater he was playing on a song called ""Wafflehead"".  And then, when the Soft Boys reunited, I ran into him on a side street near Irving Plaza in NYC.  I told him to have a good show, and he said he'd try.

I met Luna (the band).  They came into my diner, too.  Dean Wareham claimed he had heard of my band at the time, which was sweet and generous but not bloody likely, as we'd only played one show at the time.

Gary Oldman, again, in my diner.  Very nice.  Ordered an omelette, laughed at my jokes.  That's all I ask for in a customer.

Former NJ Governor Tom Kean (yes, a Republican, but an incredibly nice guy) was the president of Drew University when I was a student there.  He was unflaggingly supportive of the arts, and theatre in particular, and as I was always acting, we became quite friendly.

I went onstage with Ricky Jay once, as an audience volunteer.  Does that count?  I got some laughs when he asked me what was in my pockets.  I was sick that week, so I said, ""Snotrags.""

Kristin Hersh of Throwing Muses and I talked guitar sounds.  She really lit up.  I think everyone else that had been waiting in line for her at the record store just smeared adulation on her or something, so a conversation about actually making music was welcome.

And my band opened for a lesser-known band called the Redwalls at the Knitting Factory.  They seemed nice, but drunk.  I had been a fan for a number of years before we played with them, but barely got to talk to them because we're way too poor to get someone to work our merch table.

"From what I gathered from the video:
1. We're just too stupid to know the full plan God has for his creations. (""God works in ways we do not understand"")
2. Goodness (and other stuff) also exists. Therefore, God exists. (which is the exact counterpoint to the argument that if suffering exists, God must not exist, which they tried to refute)
3.a. God created evil so that we would know him. Instead of just, you know, talking to us.
3.b. It's man's fault for listening to the devil--which, you know, God created--and using his free will to commit sin. (Which again, I understand, but why punish the children?)
3.c. Those children that are raped and murdered are rewarded when we go to heaven. (*If* heaven exists.) It's like giving someone $1,000,000 after being raped. It does not take the pain or horror away.

It's the *same* arguments. Putting ""logical"" in the title does not make it so.

I pose this logical question for you: One of the teachings of Catholicism is ""to go to heaven, you have to truly accept God into your heart."" Even murderers and rapists can go to heaven based on this. I've checked with nuns and priests and they all agree with it. 

Take this scenario: a boy of seven years old is kept locked up in a dog cage by his father and used as a sex slave on a regular basis and treated as little more than an animal (this case exists). Say the father, after he's sent to prison, etc. etc. truly and deeply repents, and for the rest of his life, acts as God would want him to. He becomes a true follower of God. On the other hand, the boy, after his ordeal, turns his back to God. He is still a model citizen, kind and generous, but believes God must not exist if he allowed that to happen to him.

"I try to think of disruptive and aggressive people as strong rancid scents. Not all black people stink, but its hard to realize that when you've got one bad white or black person smelling up the place. Same with white people. 

Now as a white person, you may believe that you enjoy being around white people more, but the truth is, as a white person, you find it easier to overlook the undesirable sects that are a part of our people. I speak of the red necks, the yuppies, the hippies, the EMOs, the skateboarders, the blah blah blah.

If you noticed, all I did was pick a trait and generalize. Not all red necks are undesirable. I find almost all of them to kind and generous, but in the same breath, there are the bigoted, racist, foul mouth, unhygienic ones that want to make me hate them all.

It isn't their color that I hate though, or their red neck upbringing. I don't like their bigotry, racism, foul language, or slovenly habits. If we moved on to Yuppies, I detest their elitist, pretentious air. It isn't their color. I can do this with every subset of white society. Why don't I just hate all white people then?

It's because as a white person, I know that my disdain for them isn't about color. It's their personality and life choices that I dislike.

You fear that you can't resist being prejudice any longer, only when you were listing all of the things you disliked about black people, not one of those things had to do with color. You don't like blacklivesmatter because they start riots and loot. You say your mother was mugged three times by black people. They start fights with you. They insult you. They blah blah blah. Remove the word black.

You mom was mugged by three people. Classmates bullied you. Activist started riots and looted. Noisy, rude people kicked your seats in the movie theater. Your classmates were rude to teachers and disruptive. 

Do you see?

When you can only use one adjective to describe a person, the problem stops being them and starts being you. You stopped thinking of them as human beings and started seeing them as a tribe or a group or a collective. You stopped seeing the individual and can only see the mob.

You've heard of mob mentality, right? That's where when you are part of a mob of people, you end up surrendering your sense of individualism. You lose yourself to the crowd. It's an illusion of freedom whereby you convince yourself that the liabilities for your decisions can be fostered off and shared by the whole crowd. It's like telling ourselves that it is bad to take a life, but as part of a nation, our mob mentality permits us to take lives under certain circumstances. As an individual, we still believe that its bad, but as part of the mob, we tell ourselves that we didn't do it. Someone else in the mob did, thereby alleviating our guilt over the act. Being part of a mob allows us to shift our blame to another despite the fact that we supported the action by being part of the mob.

From your position outside the mob, you blame everyone who is part of the mob for the actions of the individual. It is kind of a reverse mob mentality.

The easiest way to overcome your budding prejudices and racism is to come up with a different adjective with which to describe those who offend you. If you stop at just the word black or the word white you create the mob that you so disdain. You create the bleakness in your world, not them. The more generalized and vague the adjective, the larger the mob that you create. Use a more specific adjective, and you shrink the size of the mob so that it no longer encompasses your entire world. Smaller mobs can be avoided and overcome. Larger mobs can not.

Right, but if you have $100k there isn't a whole lot to do with it. You can split it between charity and consumption, but that's pretty much it.

When you have $1billion, the function of it isn't the same. Now you need to look at creating sustainability. So you invest that $1billion, and you use the profits from it to achieve whatever goals you may have (don't care if your goals are charity or buying an NFL team, the principle is the same.)

Your focus isn't to give away $900million, it's to create a system that can keep going for year after year.

I wanted Mike Pence to run foreign and domestic policy while I made America great again, but ever since these debates where I think he reflected very well on me even though I did better and could have done better, he's really gone downhill and done some nasty things to me. He's with the crony, corrupt, elite, establishment, career politicians who want the status quo. Now I think letting him run the country would be wrong too, and I won't work for a wo- a uh... I won't work for anyone else, so I guess someone else will have to step up to the plate to make America great again.

I don't like her, she can be a real bitch, I mean have you heard her shrill shouting during these debates? How can her panties *not* be in a wad in those ridiculous pantsuits? But sure let her run the country for some same old same old since no one else will do it. It won't make America great, believe me, I'm hearing she wants to take away guns, murder a few more people, have a lizard person orgy, all kinds of things. No it won't make America great again, but she will keep the lights on until someone else can take the wheel in a few years, and we'll all get a good look at what a nasty piece of work these Democrats put forward to represent them and America will cry out for a candidate as good as me.

"Reading these threads its all very interesting in that we all can create a narrative around our beliefs. Beliefs are only true until we find another truth and they change. Thats called human growth and maximizing human potential. 

My story might shed light on the what Republicans have become to be. It isnt unique. I saw it all around me. 
My story begins growing up rural america with parents who were of a different race and democrats. One white and one mex/native. Politics wasn’t discussed much because in that world getting food on the table was the first, second and third issue. I do remember they were very democrats when voting. 
When it came time to register to vote, knowing ZERO about politics, i knew I wasn’t like them, so registered Republican. 
Fast forward a few before I decided on registering. My parents had been elevated exponentially financially from poverty/very low middle class to upper middle class in three years time.  New business....$$$$
By the time I had started college I remember them changing to the Republican party.  They changed because it fit into their new tax equations. They abandoned their own ideals because of money. By the time I graduated from grad school we could say they were on their way to being very wealthy. What came along with this new change in party was an air of superiority and racism. 
My parents, one mex/native, who experienced racism a lot now looked down upon black, and brown...and “them orientals”. My parents who never acted that way and taught me to NOT be that way. 
Its a long winded story on how money corrupted my parents and took on the republican ethos. I will leave that to another thread. It wasnt an over night change. 
All their new Republican friends were rich, racist and closed minded people. They were nice and very generous, but still....A far cry from the wholesome people i grew up with. 
I dont think its the party per say, its GREED. Republican like their money and will stop at NOTHING TO KEEP OR GET MORE. So do a lot of Democrats. Both parties have become shells of themselves, just like my parents.  We dont even know who they are anymore. I lived in nyc for years we knew Trump was a charlatan of the most high. He is a liar, a cheat and a scam artist. We all knew that. The rest of the country didnt. Republicans have become run by christian fundamentalists and this mad man. Separation of church and state....the blending of the two has never worked EVER IN history. Republicans lost their integrity with Trump, who is severely mentally ill. He has all 9 of NPD criteria and can be evidenced in his behavior on a daily basis. 
I long for the day when we had one side keeping govt smaller and one side making it bigger. We learned a lot from each other. Being a conservative today is NOTHING what it was like even 5 years ago. Printing money like its no tomorrow. Our dollar is actually worth a couple cents if we are lucky. I see nothing responsible about that. Both sides will share the shame when this collapses in on itself. 
I have remained Republican, but seldom vote that way any more since the late 80s. I remained a Republican to continue to hopefully put a responsible republican in when primaries come up. Democrats are a lesser of two evils, but with Trump its a no brainer. 

Bisexual yes...lgbtq...have a prejudice problem. 
Whats new in any group???? Its when the policies that affect a group dont match the basic needs of a group like EQUAL rights. Conservative fiscally shouldnt be synonymous with inequality policies. Thats where people will never see eye to eye with you. Its ok...as long as you own that truth, but to deny it will only keep your integrity in the closet along with your sexuality. You need to wrestle with that. It will be lonely in there. Is it really worth it? Look brother I love you as you are...i love a man searching for new truths. Nothing more beautiful...
Find a new truth and move your belief with it. Grow change and evolve...because i am pretty sure when this life is over there will be no political parties or nations or whatever we see as different, but will be asked what we did for humanity and none of this nonsense will matter.

"Yeah, I want to second what /u/KaliTheCat said. Boys and girls are still often raised very differently and with different expectations. My boyfriend is wonderful and extremely generous, but his parents didn't really see the value in teaching him basic household tasks as a child/teenager. Cooking was the biggest issue for us. I'm not a particularly good cook, but when my boyfriend and I first met, he couldn't cook anything. He didn't even own basic kitchen supplies like pots and pans. So even though he was eager to contribute and learn new skills, there were many things that I could just do faster and more efficiently—because I learned as a child—so I'd just kind of do them myself. Teaching someone else how to make a meal takes way longer than making it yourself, and most of us are pretty short on free time. It's an understandable decision. And this is more of a personal problem, but I'm admittedly kind of a control freak sometimes, and it's hard for me to watch someone do things differently than I would, even if they're still learning. I'd often be a little harsh if he did something that I felt obviously went against common sense, without remembering it might only feel like common sense to me because my mom taught it to me twenty years ago. Me snapping at him made both of us tense and compounded me just doing things myself.

A couple years ago though, I made a conscious effort to step back a bit and let him contribute in the ways he'd always been offering to. I was more patient with him while he was learning, and he's great at making dinners now. We usually alternate cooking. But as Kali said, it's complicated. Part of me felt like it wasn't his fault he didn't know any of this stuff—his parents never taught him or even conveyed it was beneficial for him to learn. But there was also a part of me that was really frustrated. He had been an adult living on his own for several years before we met, and he could've made it a priority to teach himself these things.

Women teaching their male partners how to take care of their home is really common, and that's an unfortunate reflection of the very real, but often subtle, sexism that is still present in our society. It really sucks. But in a situation like mine, it was beneficial to both of us for me to teach my boyfriend these things. And an important factor was his genuine willingness to learn them so he could contribute. My past partners weren't like that—they just expected me to do everything. To me, that's what makes all the difference.","my boyfriend is wonderful and extremely generous, but his parents didn't really see the value in teaching him basic household tasks as a child/teenager.","generous, but his","generous","but",TRUE,"wonderful and extremely generous","wonderful","extremely",NA,0,"reddit",0.63541,"thick_moral_concepts_POS","positive",NA,NA,"thick_moral_concepts"

"Great week. I spent time in the wistful world of Jacques Tati, watched some uproarious screwball comedies and had fun with Mel Gibson getting angry. As always, I'd love to discuss any of the film's below, and any further viewing suggestions would be greatly appreciated! Here's my Letterboxd, for those who are interested in my filmic ramblings: http://letterboxd.com/isarge123/ 

**Mad Max (1979) - Dir. George Miller:**  
In which Max goes mad, and George Miller doesn't give a crap about how small his budget is and makes every scene feel bombastically grandiose despite their limitations. Obviously his vision isn't conveyed as truly as in *The Road Warrior* or to an ever greater extent: *Fury Road*, but I have to admire what was achieved with the means available to him. 
**8/10**  

**The Patriot (2000) - Dir. Roland Emmerich:**  
In which Mel Gibson and a small ragtag band of guys heroically defeat the utterly despicable British army. Seriously though, as much I try to knock *Mel Gibson IS The Patriot* for its blind patriotism and historical ignorance, I can't, because by golly it's well done. The photography is beautiful (the lighting in some scenes is just breathtaking), John Williams' score is appropriately sweeping, Mel Gibson is commanding and there are some touching moments of genuine humanity amongst the expertly staged battles and bloodshed. And mostly I'm just surprised that Roland Emmerich made a movie I kinda liked (I still haven't seen *Independence Day*). Ridiculous for sure, but I'm a sucker for historical epics, and this one was highly enjoyable. 
**7/10**  

**To Be Or Not To Be (1942) - Dir. Ernst Lubitsch:**  
Yikes! And I thought *The Great Dictator* had balls. An uproarious farce filled with humour as black as a Nazi swastika and featuring Ernst Lubitsch's energetic, un-showy direction and a truly terrific performance from Jack Benny. One of my new favourite comedies, heck, it's one of my new favourite films. 
**10/10**  

**Aladdin (1992) - Dir. Ron Clements &amp; John Musker:**  
An example of an excellent performance/character elevating a merely decent film to a very good one. The first act is typical enjoyable but generic Disney, but once Robin William's hilarious Genie shows up *Aladdin* takes on a life of its own. In possibly my favourite vocal performance of all time, Williams provides an unstoppable force of wildly energetic comedy, perfectly matched by the animators who at times seem like they're struggling to keep up with him (in a good way of course). Without Williams, I doubt the film would be anywhere near as inventive and stylish as it is. The music (particularly *Friend Like Me*) is sparkling as well. 
**8/10**  

**Mission: Impossible: Rogue Nation (2015) - Dir. Christopher McQuarrie:**  
I really liked this on my first viewing, and I LOVED it on the second. The plot is entirely serviceable, and despite its relentless momentum it remains easy to follow throughout. But it's McQuarrie who really steals the show, directing the proceedings with a kinetic energy that never lets up, and I still found it really suspenseful even after remembering the main plot points. The action scenes are sleek and coherent, with too many masterfully-executed pieces of exhilaration to possibly pick a favourite. A generous but enthusiastic 
**9/10**  

**The Dressmaker (2015):**  
A well-acted, handsomely shot but clumsily told tale. Kate Winslet admirably attempts to keep things grounded, Judy Davis is very funny in a scene-stealing performance and Hugo Weaving lends sincerity and heart to his overdone stereotype. But the whole film constantly switches from (sometimes absurdist) comedy to disturbing moments of tragedy, and the frequent tonal shifts never really worked for me. I understand that I don't really fit the demographic for this movie, but regardless of how much it did or didn't appeal to me, *The Dressmaker* is still a mess. 
**4.5/10**  

**Bringing Up Baby (1938) - Dir. Howard Hawks:**  
Cary Grant is a palaeontologist trying to obtain the lost bone of a brontosaurus. Katherine Hepburn is a possible nutcase trying to obtain Grant's heart, and keep her pet leopard in check. These characters inhabit one of the funniest comedies I've ever seen. I was laughing myself silly even on this second watch. The screenplay is excellent, but it's Howard Hawk's manic direction and the wildly energetic performances that keep this rollicking ride as fun and as fast as it is. Katherine Hepburn is frankly amazing. She explodes off the screen with such chaotic force that it makes you want to duck for cover whenever she opens her mouth. Cary Grant is also at his best as the poor soul destined to endure Hepburn's harassment and the crazy adventure that follows. 
**9.5/10**  

**Monsieur Hulot's Holiday (1953) - Dir. Jacques Tati:**  
So it was my birthday and I impulsively treated myself to the superb *Jacques Tati Restored Collection* Blu-Ray, despite having seen none of his movies. My first foray into the filmography of Jacques Tati was a thoroughly enjoyable one, a warm holiday that ends with a bang (well, lots of them). Unfortunately I decided to watch this while tired and mentally preoccupied, which doesn't help when many of the gags require utmost attention to fully appreciate, despite the relaxing tone that permeates the whole film. Then again, Tati's creation isn't really a *film*. It's a world. I think I'll appreciate this even more once I'm more familiar with his style and in a better position to watch this. I still loved it. 

**9/10**  

**Jour de Fete/The Big Day (1949) - Jacques Tati:**  
Being a lesser-known Tati, I wasn't expecting this one to be as good as it was. Obviously Tati is a master behind the camera, but in this he's equally brilliant in front of it. Nearly everything Francois does, from swinging his satchel dramatically around his shoulder to the general way in which he talks, is hilarious. If my journey with Tati continues at this delightful rate he'll be shooting up my favourite directors list in no time. A slightly pricey purchase that definitely payed off.

"I don't wish to give any specific details because these people weren't malicious, in fact I would say there were exceptionally kind and generous. But in general, the wealthy have tools available to them to game the system and they use them. They can lobby for laws and government benefits to themselves. Not just nationally but at the state and local level too. And they can be completely out of touch of the reality of the working class. They don't ask ""what is best for all stakeholders"" (e.g., owners, workers, the community, etc) they only ask ""what is best for the stockholders"". I'm convinced that a ""stock holder"" economy vs. a ""stake holder"" economy is doomed to fail eventually.

All the stuff you hear about poor people gaming the welfare system? Well that is small potatoes compared to the sophisticated efforts of the wealthy in milking the public purse for all its worth.

Unchecked conservative economic policies would eventually lead us back to feudalism or something like it.

Unchecked liberal economic policy would result in equally bad outcomes in the other direction.

Selling the products doesn't mean someone is making a profit, it's only ever done when the product simply cannot be used/divided yet still has a high enough value and likelihood for a completed sale, the funds from the sale are treated exactly as if the funds themselves had been donated rather than the specific product.","as someone interested in makeup i can see how and why you feel that way but turnaround rates in shelters are very high, people come and go every single day even if the shelter is very small (partially due to need or desires of individuals in other cooperating community shelters), getting a donation set of the entire tom ford lipstick line would be incredibly generous but absurd, lip products of any brand will have the exact same value despite mrp for the shelter (and for majority of the homeless women) so why not auction/sell the tom ford?","generous but absurd","generous","but",FALSE,"incredibly generous but absurd","absurd","incredibly",NA,1,"reddit",-0.14641,"thick_moral_concepts_POS","positive",NA,NA,"thick_moral_concepts"

"Full disclosure, I struggle with this also.  While I haven't beaten it, I do have it managed to a level which doesn't set me back.  

&gt; free food, which is pretty much ""eat what you can now!""

Yes, but we're calorie restricted, so that food isn't free.  It comes out of our budget -- it's just not dollars in the budget, it's calories.  

Some random thoughts:

* quantity is not quality -- there is no added merit in large portions of merely average food.  This holds true even if the food is great -- there's nothing in that second helping that wasn't in the first.  If you're spending your calories and going for seconds, make it something else that is not everyday store-bought junk-food junk.
* at least half of what is being served is below average, by mathematical law -- so shop wisely.
* crowds and noise make me eat quickly (and overeat) -- so I'm not going to put a lot on my plate.  I am going to put one thing and a small amount of it, and then go socialize a while away from the food as I enjoy slowly.  I'm not going to let the frenetic activity cause me to rush through the food and subtract from my enjoyment of it or the event.  
* you're probably going over budget anyway -- give yourself a generous but reasonable allowance and ""save up"" for the event by eating lightly in the days before and right after the event.  I've found that I'm never hungry for breakfast the day after a party -- I'm still satiated from the night before.  There's a few hundred calories right there.  And I can sometimes eat light all day on the day of the party knowing that I'm going to go a little heavier (including a drink) at the party.  
* the goal is to lose weight and live your life at the same time.  You have to balance these -- eating lighter than you used to but not cutting yourself off.  Balance is hard and you may struggle, it's okay.  Just do your best but keep these two rules topmost
 * have fun, its a party
 * stay in control, its not a blank check

"Okay let's get technical. Taxation is defined as a mandatory financial charge or some other type of levy imposed upon a taxpayer by a governmental organization in order to fund various public expenditures and failing to pay will result in a punishment. In no way am I saying taxation is stupid, it is necessary but not to the extent that socialist countries do it which is usually 50% or above. Socialism works until you run out of other people's money. Want an example?

"The thing that amuses me about this is that the people who are putting the most energy and intensity into labeling... are the people complaining about how horrible the labels are! 

And the thing is, the labels aren't bad at all. (Except ""throuple"". That one needs to die in a fire.) A label for a partner, friend, or lover should be three things; simple, descriptive, and generous. Someone who hears it should know what it means without additional explanation, there should be relatively little or no confusion about the relationship so described, and it should make the other person so labeled feel good.

""Sexual partner"" fails - it's simple, it's descriptive, but it's not generous.
""Boyfriend/Girlfriend"" is simple, and it's reasonably descriptive, but many people think of it as being childish, more associated with teenagers and young adults. It is generous, however.
""Lover"" works - simple, descriptive, and generous.
""Significant Other"" - simple, descriptive, not very generous. It does have the advantage of being descriptive of the relationship but not the person, which is particularly handy in group situations.
""Partner"" - simple, descriptive, generous.

The trouble is when we as poly folk want to create labels that mean the same things as existing labels but for our specific situations. This is difficult because other, non-poly folk won't know what they mean; by default, the labels we create may be simple and generous but they will fail as descriptive labels because others won't have pictures for them. ""Poly"" itself is slowly being recognized in the wider community, but beyond that many use ""triad"", ""vee"", etc. - and those tend to only succeed where it's a borrowed term that context can make clear, as with the terms we've borrowed from musical groupings. ""Quartet"", ""Triad"", ""Quintet"" etc. really are just labels for the number of items in a set; when you're referring to a relationship, it's easy to understand and most people do even if they're not poly themselves.

"&gt;  Belief in Jesus is only required for sinners.

Ok, other than jesus... who is/was not a sinner and therefore going straight to heaven even if they didn't believe that he is *the way*?

&gt;If you are born and choose never to sin, then you will go to Heaven with no belief in Jesus Christ required. 

So you don't believe in the *original* sin?

Once again... doesn't the bible say that **All** (except JC) have sinned?  (Romans 3:23) Do you not *believe* that?  If you don't believe that then ok, then *that* person doesn't need jesus to get into heaven.  Even though JC said that *No one comes to the Father except through me.*  He didn't say except those without sin.  I guess you don't believe that either?  

Do you mind If I ask just what christian denomination you follow?  Because a lot of what you're saying is new to me.  I was a Catholic, Baptist, Church of Christ and *Non-Denominational* christian at one time in my life.  For over 30 years.  

&gt;Hell isn't how the Hollywood movies portray. It isn't homogeneous. Its not the same experience for everyone who is there.

Where do you get this info from?  Where **exactly** is this found in the bible?  I've never read or even heard of *different levels* of hell.  

&gt;in this way could he be a true human instead of a pretend one.

He didn't know that he would be ressurected?  He didn't know that he was the son of god... therefore... he was god?  He sure acted like it.  He told the thief hanging next to him that he would be in heaven with him that very day.  (He was wrong, of course, because it took several days) Also a *true* human will sin.  He didn't.

"There has been cases of students only going to university to receive the financial support but it is a small minority and usually they are kicked out after a semester or two if they do not take their exams. In general it is not a big problem (but media likes to bring it up once in a while). There is a another related issue. Danish students have traditionally taken their time completing their degree taxing the system for resources not strictly needed. Today completing a full track BA + MA would in most cases be 5 years but many take more than a year more. This might be due to education being free but there are other likely causes. E.g. a Danish MA student typically has a part time job 10-20 hours a week, both to receive extra income (many are quite independent of parent income) and to get work experience. Until recently, expectations from professors for MA thesis work were high and incentives pushed students to spend more than the 6 months alloted. 

There has been many policy changes that have thought to lower both the time between high school and university and at university in the last two decades. A new law last year (goes into full effect this fall) does more to speed up students, including mandatory class and exam registration (the law has been criticised for being to rigid, which might e.g. increase dropout rate though). Even before this law we have seen improvements but Danish students still graduate later than in many comparable countries.

Regarding dilution, there has been some critique that the large increase in student intake as well as some policy changes in the last decade has contributed  to lowering standards. I am not aware of any study that supports this though. Denmark has 8 official universities and a long list of other schools of higher education. There are strict rules for granting degrees , e.g. schools granting BA/BSC or MA/MSC degrees are required to do research and expose students to research. Degrees are accredited by a government institution that has the power to close degrees if they fail. Schools are also accredited on an institutional level with a with a focus on assuring local quality assurance policies are up to standard. 

Regarding skilled labor, Denmark has a similar system to the German one. Crafts are taught at technical schools that students go to instead of high school. The degree is a mix of classes and paid internships. It takes about 4 years to finish technical school after which graduates either join the labor force or, a minority, continue with further education at speciality schools or university. There's a shortage of internships and this has been the case for quite a while. Technical schools offer students to do internships at the school but this is inferior to a proper internship. I am not an expert but I would say the system is under great pressure at the moment. On top of the internship issue, traditional crafts require more advanced studies while at the same time high schools attract the best and brightest students (and have seen an increase in intake). I'm not sure how big this mismatch in skills is but it has been covered by media.

Edit: 
For a lack of a better place to put this, this will have to do. There has been talks by experts and politicians that we need to do away with the traditional expectation of students competing a full BA + MA track and instead finish with only a BA. Currently, there is a gap in the labor market where graduates either have associates degrees or a ""professional BA"" (3.5 years focused on applied studies, e.g. teaching. No requirement for research-based teaching and thus criticised as low standard). This gap is both due to the generous but expensive educational system but also union-employer labour market agreements that provides incentives for employers to hire mostly MA over BA graduates. One way to change this is to make students pay for an MA and it has been discussed but student so far dismissed by politicians. Some say the policy changes have pushed this discussion much into the future if they solve the issues they are meant to, others say it is the foundation for such a system.

"Hello young person. I hope that you get something that helps you here. You're going to probably get a mix of messages about forgiveness and finding strength but I'm going to put my own spin on this too. 

&gt;He used to beat my mum. Not terribly, but he did it.

If this was one isolated incident of him having the worst day of his life and your mother also having the worst bender of all time and he had to use some knuckle encouragement to get her to stop from killing you that's one thing. 

Men who hurt women are not my favorite people. I'm pretty far on the ""kick his dick into the dirt until the dirt is sick of that dick"" side of the fence. ""used to beat my mum"" is probably up there with my least favorite things to read.

He's a man. If he's a real man he's going to reach out to you and make that relationship happen. You have an empty place in your life and that's just the facts. I wish there were a way to magic up a healthy relationship but that may never happen. That's one that sucks, but sometimes you have to rip off the band-aid. Hairs and all. 

If you feel strong about this one give it a shot. Do it with a third party. Not a snotty third party though, an impartial one. I'm not sure how old you are or what your resources are, but maybe get in touch with a councilor or a therapist. You basically just want a referee. Someone who can tell you or him to pump the breaks and cool off because you're both going to have a very emotional conversation if it happens. 

The most important thing to know though is that you are not your father. You are not your mother. You are your own person and you're starting your life anew. Whatever it was that made your dad behave the way he did stops here. It's over. You are already showing a lot (not alot) of compassion, consideration, and kindness, and you're going to have a better life. 

I don't mean better in the money sense, that's stupid, people make and lose millions while they're sleeping. Screwed up, I know. I mean *quality* of life. You're not going to let people be hurt on your watch, you're going to be kind and generous but not let people step on you. You're going to love someone and you deserve to be loved back. 

If your mom is still alive talk to her about this, be honest, be ready to hear some hurtful things about your old man. 

In the end, we all make our own decisions and we live with them. If someone here says something that you think helps you make a quality one, then I'm glad. Whether that happens or not though, you have to make your own. 


Your dad doesn't sound like my favorite type of dad, but even he might might have some redeemable qualities. 

Here's the ripping off the band-aid part. If I have an argument with my SO/Girlfriend/Wife/Children and even if I'm in a fervor driven, fever fueled, worst  day of my life state I'm going to go try to make peace before the sun goes down. I apologize, talk it out, let that person know that I know I was being a douche. Not that there's anything wrong with a douche, it's just vinegar and water, but it's good to take personal responsibility. 

This is a ""shaggy dog story"". It's something that goes on way too long but it's done that way to be cathartic because at the end of this story there's a punch line, but not the funny kind. 

Deep breath. Really. Take it. Think about sunsets and rainbows.



Sometimes you have to let somebody go.



Sometimes it can work, but sometimes it doesn't. 

I hope it works for you, but being prepared for it not working is a good thing to have in your toolkit too. Personally, I think give communication a try with a third party there to balance out the emotional fallout one time. One. Then give it 2 years and don't regret anything. Also, I think if your mom is alive you should get her some flowers. They don't have to be expensive, hell, steal them out of a graveyard if you have to (don't. just joking) but you know what I mean. If her husband was beating her, get some flowers for ""no reason"". 

You know the reason. She does too. It's a good thing to happen in the universe. Show mom some love, give dad some patience, and in the end of the day don't tolerate anyone, dad or not dad, who doesn't show love. Life is far, far, far, too short for that.

Upon his graduation in the Cambridge Natural Sciences Tripos in 1882, he was “bribed” by his father to persevere in his medical studies with the gift of a summer trip to Istanbul (or, as it was still known in Europe, Constantinople). In 1884, on his own initiative, he also took the so-called “Indian” Languages (in fact, languages of the Islamic world) Tripos at Cambridge. There followed three years of further medical study, internship, and practice, interrupted, whenever the occasion allowed, for pursuit of his private, “Oriental” interests. In 1887 be achieved both his final medical qualifications and a fellowship from his Cambridge college (Pembroke), which enabled him to spend his celebrated year in Iran—for it was by then unquestionably Persian studies that were claiming his main atten­tion. It was this visit that generated the remarkable book, *A Year Amongst the Persians,* which, despite its romantic and archaic title, approach, and style, remains a classic source. It was first published in 1893, after being more than once turned down, and has since been reprinted several times under various auspices (chiefly A. C. Black and Cambridge University Press).




After his return to Britain in 1888, Browne’s life was spent almost wholly in Cambridge, remaining outwardly quite unspectacular. He was first University Lecturer in Persian and then, from 1902 until his death, Sir Thomas Adams’s Professor of Arabic; the latter post was one of two prestigious but ill-paid chairs nominally in the field of Arabic studies then maintained in the university. Until 1906 he lived a vigorous, if somewhat self-centered, social life as a bachelor in his college; in that year he married Alice Blackburne-Daniell, a well­-to-do and influential Roman Catholic, who enlisted his vague but generous sympathies both for Roman Ca­tholicism and for the cause of an independent Ireland. They had two sons, neither of whom followed his father’s interests, though later both lent them moral and financial support. Browne suffered a massive heart attack in November, 1924; his wife died in June, 1925, six months before his own death. The last year or so of his life was little more than a gallant holding action.




To appreciate Browne’s remarkable academic achievements (as well as some of his peculiar shortcom­ings) at their proper evaluation, it is necessary to understand something of his personal position and the world in which he lived and worked. He was bred to wealth and status and was (particularly in his mature years) a very rich man in his own right. This meant that his time was largely his own (his statutory duties were minimal) and that he could please himself in virtually everything he did and said. He could choose his own projects, pay for them and their publication if necessary (as it often was), and personally employ such colleagues and helpers (several Iranians among them) as the university would not hire. But this situation carried its disadvantage as well. If he was generous and clever and often charming, he was also egotistical (several tributes bear witness to his fascinating but nearly always one-­sided discourse); and, as frequently happens in such cases, his judgment could be willful and erratic and the self-discipline necessary for the finest academic work very difficult to achieve. His almost continuous antagonism to his own government and the establish­ment (related to general Middle Eastern diplomacy and the Persian “Question,” Ireland, South Africa­—liberals in those days were pro-Boer—anti-Germanism and concomitant pro-Russian and pro-French policy, inadequate educational measures, and so on) largely does him credit, no doubt; it certainly cost him deserved public recognition and influence. It also, however, sometimes contained elements of the arbitrary and the cranky, and anyone less privileged might well have had cause to be more circumspect. As with most of his contemporaries, all his ways seem to have been firmly set before he reached the age of thirty. He had, too, something in him of upper-class Victorian-Edwardian philistinism: Early in life he engaged in tennis, squash, and rowing, and later he took up fishing, but he had no time for art, music, religion, or indeed for languages or cultures outside his chosen field. His early enthusiasm for Turkish studies soon waned, while for “Indian” culture he seemed to cherish a marked antipathy most of his life, considering it to represent a debased version of all that he loved in Iran. He was no sybarite: Given endless cigarettes and tea, he could apparently easily dispense (for himself and his guests) with good food or wine.

Now, for Deku specifically that'd be my younger sister. She always grew up frustratingly kind and generous but also very sensitive too, so it was difficult for people to ""bully"" her per se but only because she often caved in to people's desires/wants without really voicing her own. For me, I felt more attuned with Bakugo. I grew up with a bad attitude, liked getting into fights and had personal issues that were translated to being a little jerk but I was fiercely protective of my sister. 

We've both grown up (in our mid-late twenties now) of course and out of that mindset for the most part but watching the anime was a fun experience for us cos it felt like we were talking down memory lane. We really liked how personable these kids were despite having these super powers and doing these crazy stunts. Now we both celebrate the anime together, work out more often and cook meals (sometimes the character's favorites) together. 

So I think it's great and completely awesome that you feel inspired by them too!

"Oh but they are known, not registered for sure (and if the police were to force them, they would probably start a riot or something, then cry that the french police isn't nice with them and that they deserve to be treated well and shit), but believe me faces off with the police isn't uncommon.

The problem is those bleeding heart leftists, like other countries in Western Europe, who go like ""that is racism and we should help these poor souls"" whenever the idea of actually doing something against them is brought up.

Edit: also, France already gets a lot of shit for the ""inhuman conditions"" in which these migrants live from the European Union and Great Queen Merkel. So yeah. France is stuck between the will to act, and the risk of loosing its place just because some persons decided it was wrong to act against illegal migrants known to provoke accidents on the highway, rob people from the local town, rob the volunteers who are here to fucking help them, and complain that the food we give them thanks to either our taxes or some generous but soft hearted donors is shit, and they just throw it and all...

"&gt;We can't know definitively how much the doping influenced the outcomes but we do know Lance thought it was important enough to risk his entire career and legacy to do. That, in itself, probably tells us what Lance thinks about him winning those races without doping.
If Lance doesn't think he could have won them without cheating, why should we just ignore his cheating on the grounds that he was great while cheating?

This is a strong argument, and one that has occurred to me before, but I can't quite fully agree with it yet. I think it almost naively discounts the condition of the sport being rampant with drug use. I am speculating here and could be wrong, but I imagine a scenario like this -- young athlete realizes the sport's elite are almost exclusively using PEDs that no natural body could compete with, athlete decides he'd rather be a winner in the PED-league than a nobody who didn't take PEDs. Now morally, I agree we can hold that against athlete. But in terms of assessing his ability, should that count against him?

I.e., imagine that lifting weights was ""banned"" as training in the NFL. Nonetheless, many linebackers secretly lift weights to get stronger. Young player x realizes that even though it's banned, the whole freaking league is lifting weights, and he will never have a chance at being strong enough to compete unless he lifts too. Is that really wrong? Does that really invalidate his achievements? 

I think that is admittedly a bit generous, but analogous to what Lance did. Unless I am mistaken, he did not bring the culture of PEDs to cycling, he found it that way. So while we can indict him morally, in terms of athletic competition, I believe he still proved he was better than anyone else.

"For 4. I hate to break it to you but Denna all but tells us she is a 'whore' or, if you want to be generous but still pejorative, a 'gold-digger'. Personally I wouldn't use those words though and pick something more neutral like 'escort', 'prositute' or the generic 'sex worker' or maybe coin a new term like 'professional companion'. But Denna is way more complex than that. I love her relationship with Kvothe and the ebb and flow of it and how similar they are, how much insight they show into one another yet how little they understand (or rather empathise, especially Kvothe) with one another. Some people are very biased against women, especially those who might be sex workers. I wouldn't put any stock in it.

For 1. Repetition a basic and fudemental feature of story-telling. Dramatic effect is also part of story-teller so I do not understand that. Kvothe himself likes to cast himself as unique and someone no-one can truly relate with. Meanwhile he refuses to reveal the secrets of his heart to anyone, even Denna, while he steals peaks at their's. I can totally see Kvothe, especially if it is young Kvothe speaking, not getting that other people's empathy is capable of much more than he ever gives it credit for. Hence using that phrase. That said, too much repetition can grate. But the fact you were able to reread the books several times before it began to grate (or it didn't grate enough to stop you enjoying the rereading) suggests he didn't get this entirely wrong persay.

The rest is fair game. I think they represent stylistic choices to an extent and Rothfuss is the kind of author who will obesses for months on how to get a single passage right but he still has to finish a book. Hence inconsistency in the writing. Most stories, especially of this length, are not consistent all the way through after all. But I totally get feeling the entire work suffers for the excessive attention lavished on some parts of it. But then no story is consistent. It's just not possible. Why would a story about stories be something stories are not? :P

As for the Wise Man's Fear. I've only read it 1 and 1/2 times so far. I'm sure the flaws will start popping around 5. Then again maybe not. I mean the Dark Elf Trilogy (one of my absolute favorite books growing up: I had them in one complete edition) is undoubtedly a flawed work.

Your family is manipulating you. Don't buy in, but for now, pretend to agree. They are being nuts about accusing your body roommate stealing things.

Your roommate is generous BUT irresponsible. I sincerely doubt she is a thief. But she is an unclear communicator, a bit immature and a LOT irresponsible. She may be a nice person but it's gonna be unstable living with her long-term.

You need to get away from both sides in the long term.

For now, save up and keep looking for new roommates.

If that means staying with your irresponsible roomie for now, you NEED to sign a contract and agree in writing on how expenses will be shared. This is about making sure your friendship is preserved because having things written down means you have to have a clear convo about it.

Or, if that means staying with your parents, that's OK too. But save like crazy. Network like crazy. Find a new roommate after Skyping or chatting with at least 5 people who meet your criteria.

For now, I would try to have that uncomfortable convo with your roommie. If she is mature about it and you agree on all items, including what happens if she doesn't pay rent, then sign the contract. She is subcontracting to you - make sure that is legal. If she blows a gasket or refuses to put it in writing or seems immature, LEAVE.

Honestly your parents aren't that mature either. But just keep your head on straight, accept their offer to help, and make a proper plan to find good roommates and delay moving out while you save.

You're hoping to create a market where none previously exists, and a subscription model at that. You're swimming against the tide here, and your expectations should have been grounded accordingly. You've shown yourself to be quite thin skinned, and it would suggest that it wouldn't take much to push you over the edge of pulling the app somewhere down the line.

 I understand your need for compensation, and a sizable portion of the community agrees, even if it hasn't previously materialized into actual donations. Your initial thread posed the question of monetization, and what followed was a dozen threats to close down the app. A lot of your anger and frustration, justified or not, comes out of the blue for us. As others have pointed out, the initial selling point of your app was no ads. You've never talked about the need for monetization, so it took a lot of people by surprise.

"&gt;By ""expenses,"" does that mean bills that you necessarily need to pay, or the amount of money you generally spend every month, including retirement contributions?

Things you necessarily need to pay, plus a little extra to cover job hunting costs. However, looking at your list, you should also be including food in your ""expenses,"" and whatever baby supplies you'll be buying (diapers, etc.). I definitely wouldn't include the amount you put in your savings or your retirement accounts in ""expenses"" though, because if you lost your job or had some other major life emergency, you could stop those for a while.

Edit: I added up your expenses list and got $1630. I estimated $600 for food &amp; baby expenses, which I think is pretty generous, but better safe than sorry--that gets us to $2230/month. For 6 months, that puts you at $13380. Throw in a little extra for good measure, and you should have $13.5-14k in your emergency fund.

"&gt;I also don't think it's fair to compare seizing an illegally parked car

I think it's a perfect analogy.

&gt;we're invading someone's privacy and taking property based on hearsay

The article that you quoted says based on a judge's ruling. I'm sure there's evidence involved, and it's not a kangaroo court like you claim. Your best argument here is that this system is vulnerable to abuse, but it's really too early to tell how this system will play out.

&gt;As far as the AWB and crime rate drop goes, I think 2 things: 1) the economy was doing much better in the 90's and early 2000's than it has been over the last decade, and poverty is the biggest driver of crime there is. 2) All rifles -not just those covered by an awb- make up 2% of homicides and even less in violent crime, so I don't think restricting those would have any real impact.

See, now it gets complicated now doesn't it? The points that you made are all relevant, but not substantiated (you haven't presented any numbers or sound arguments. ""I think"" isn't exactly scientific), so you haven't quite excluded the AWB as the underlying cause.

1. The authors should've mentioned it. But again, because DC's population is small, it won't have much of an impact on the statistical conclusion. It's a drop in the ocean, so much so that I bet the numbers don't even change.

2. &amp; 4. Spoken like someone who's wholly unqualified to interpret the data set. If you carried that mindset into medicine, you'd have to reject all of it. Every Single Treatment. Clinical trials are all correctional studies, and every treatment that your doctor prescribes is based on the the correlation between your demographic and the maximized intended benefit. Spurious causes are rare. The authors of the cited study presented solid statistical evidence that indicate gun regulations reduce gun deaths. The burden of evidence is on you to disprove their finding.

Further, the two points that you presented are completely irrelevant. The author actually accounted for ""good"" guns in their study by not making a distinction. Their finding suggests that regulation of all guns, regardless of good or bad, leads to decreases in gun violence.

3) While longitudinal studies are generally better, the lack of historical data does not beg any question. The authors' presented the most current data, so it's the most valid for projection. As to why they didn't look into the readily available historical data? My guess is funding (almost all research boils down to this). There's 3 MD's and 2 research doctorates as authors. If the Joyce foundation gave them $100k for this study (which is generous, but fair, estimate) and we ignore all research related costs (which are quite high); the grant would've supported their salaries for just 4 weeks + 1 day.

5) Since you still can't see it, I'm going to assume that you didn't read the paper, at least in detail. Table 3 specifically studies homicides and suicides separately. This is an open access (and very good) paper, so I highly suggest that you read and understand it.

&gt;Another thing I failed to mention, is how they determine ""strong gun control laws""? all the article tells us is 

It's detailed in table one. Obstacles to purchase are weighed much more heavily than current possession, which reflects the intent of the paper well. This is a moot point though, since there has not be any valid challenges to the methods of this paper, besides the lack of longitudinal data. That, however, iis a call for further studies, not a challenge to the validity of the conclusions of the current study.

&gt;Really? He only partially answered questions like here, avoided answe...

Again, most of those questions have no bearing on the conclusions of the paper. Most of it is borderline ad hominem attacks (rather than legitimate challenges to his qualifications or methods) or irrelevant points (that even addressed, have no bearing on the interpretation of his data) raised by obviously unqualified individuals. Case in point:

&gt;ignores every question about whether other gun laws could have been responsible (such as allowing concealed cary)

His study actually covers this. It's listed under table 1, restrictions to ""shall issue"" concealed carry is one of the qualifying gun regulations that he studied.

You have to realize that hes a doctor (and I'll agree that he's narrow minded in this matter, which I'll explain later), his time is expensive and his character is rather blunt. (Again, I haven't read everything yet) He seems to avoid engaging in discussion with people who are not on intellectually qualified to understand and accept the answers that he will provide. Again, [case in point](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/3zx8xc/science_ama_series_im_david_hemenway_director_of/cypy5fy), his paper answers this: he suggests restricting the purchase of firearms. It's cheap (only cost is enforcement), firearms aren't essential to daily life, and resolves the raised issue perfectly. Further on this point, you have to realize that he's a doctor. He really doesn't care how much you don't want the surgery or how expensive treatment is, his endgame is only the intended benefit, the methods (outside the archaic deontological ethics prescribed by the AMA) are irrelevant.

FWIW, I'm a gun owner and against most of the proposed firearms regulation, including the implied recommendations of this paper. As a scientist, I accept the findings of this paper. It's not only a valid study, it's a good study. Methods are solid, design is innovative, and presentation is beautiful. It should be intuitive that if we ban all guns, there would be no legal guns. If there are no legal guns, then the supply of illegal guns will be scarce. And if the supply of illegal guns is scarce, then crimes involving a gun will become scarce. But banning guns is fking unamerican and there are more elegant (but more expensive and harder) ways to solve this issue, such as eliminating poverty.","if the joyce foundation gave them $100k for this study (which is generous, but fair, estimate) and we ignore all research related costs (which are quite high); the grant would've supported their salaries for just 4 weeks + 1 day.","generous, but fair","generous","but",TRUE,"generous , but fair","fair",NA,NA,1,"reddit",0.54675,"thick_moral_concepts_POS","positive",NA,NA,"thick_moral_concepts"

"Thanks :) 
Freya is potentially the most wild female image, overtly sexual, is fierce and flighty and winds up leading the Valkyrie. She is still gentle and feminine, magical and compassionate, and has a unique relationship with Odin (in my interpretation and research as a lover and partner first in addition to Frigg, as a teacher of Vanir magics-
 especially Seidr, as a student and coworker) and retains a lot of independence in lore, even laying claim to half of all fallen warriors for her feilds Fólkvangr and hall Sessrúmnir. I suspect they have a slightly different focus than Valhalla even while war is still practiced by those spirits awaiting Ragnarok... considering Freya's interests and liberal proclivities. 

All that considered, Frigg the wife of Odin (and it's important to note that wife in ancient prechristian/non roman/greek/eastern context pretty much was a ceremonial title of rank, love, responsibility, and shared children) is usually more gentle, dutiful, and concerned with imagination and understanding of the future. 
She is perhaps the idealized form of gentle, generous, but authoritative feminine principle.

Frigg's handmaiden Eir (and also more likely more of an intimate companion and allegiant) is possibly the most gentle and compassionate of all the Aesir associated specifically with healing, medicine, mercy, and helpfulness. She cares for all especially to help Frigg and the Aesir.

Idunn (Youth), and Sif (Bounty) are also loving, compassionate and generous.

"&gt;First of all, when a murder happens, the police can't randomly arrest someone. Innocent until proven guilty. I needn't prove my innocence. The police must prove my guilt. The same goes for this scenario. When I say animal sacrifice is evil, which it is, I don't understand why people might be asking me for proof. You're the one who's murdering innocent animals, so you must prove to me why what you're doing is right.

This is circular. You're saying that ""killing animals is wrong"" requires no proof because it is wrong.

&gt;Some asked if I was a vegetarian or not. Now, I'm not a vegetarian yet, but soon will be, I'm almost there actually. But that isn't the main point at all. I was concentrating on sacrificing animals in the name of god. It makes the RELIGION evil. Nobody should follow a religion that demands life.

Why not? Seems like a small price to pay to honor the Gods and ancestors. 

&gt;If god demands lives as sacrifices, does that not make god evil? Of course it does.

How does that follow? It's okay to sacrifice the lives of animals to build a parking lot, or a soybean farm for your veggie burgers, but it's somehow *not* okay to sacrifice to the gods? That seems like a rather glaring contradiction. Our entire society is predicated on the destruction of nature and its denizens for the most trivial of human conveniences. You would probably think nothing of bulldozing a forest and everything that lives there to build a server farm to support the silliest forms of electronic entertainment -- and yet you would probably consider directly killing a single animal for religious reasons to be barbaric.

&gt;First of all, why would god create life only to ask for it to be sacrificed in his/her name?

One wouldn't. In the European tradition, at least, the sacrificial animals were domesticated. God didn't create them. Men did. At least that's how they thought of it. By honoring the god by sacrificing something you raised yourself, you demonstrate respect and generosity.

&gt;Isn't god ""ALL LOVING, ALL FORGIVING?""

No. The gods are capricious, jealous, vengeful. They can also be just, merciful, and generous. But they are not ""all"" anything.

&gt;God only seems to demand animal lives as sacrifices. 

No, plenty of cultures also demand human sacrifices.

&gt;What makes humans superior to animals?

Many belief systems would say that we are descended from the Gods in a way that animals are not. Our right is one of kinship, if nothing else.

"I work in the sign and lighting industry. Yall are right about LEDs. Retrofits are one of our biggest sellers.

Bernie is characteristically generous, and Biden has a less-generous but more detailed plan.

"&gt;First of all, when a murder happens, the police can't randomly arrest someone. Innocent until proven guilty. I needn't prove my innocence. The police must prove my guilt. The same goes for this scenario. When I say animal sacrifice is evil, which it is, I don't understand why people might be asking me for proof. You're the one who's murdering innocent animals, so you must prove to me why what you're doing is right.

This is circular. You're saying that ""killing animals is wrong"" requires no proof because it is wrong.

&gt;Some asked if I was a vegetarian or not. Now, I'm not a vegetarian yet, but soon will be, I'm almost there actually. But that isn't the main point at all. I was concentrating on sacrificing animals in the name of god. It makes the RELIGION evil. Nobody should follow a religion that demands life.

Why not? Seems like a small price to pay to honor the Gods and ancestors. 

&gt;If god demands lives as sacrifices, does that not make god evil? Of course it does.

How does that follow? It's okay to sacrifice the lives of animals to build a parking lot, or a soybean farm for your veggie burgers, but it's somehow *not* okay to sacrifice to the gods? That seems like a rather glaring contradiction. Our entire society is predicated on the destruction of nature and its denizens for the most trivial of human conveniences. You would probably think nothing of bulldozing a forest and everything that lives there to build a server farm to support the silliest forms of electronic entertainment -- and yet you would probably consider directly killing a single animal for religious reasons to be barbaric.

&gt;First of all, why would god create life only to ask for it to be sacrificed in his/her name?

One wouldn't. In the European tradition, at least, the sacrificial animals were domesticated. God didn't create them. Men did. At least that's how they thought of it. By honoring the god by sacrificing something you raised yourself, you demonstrate respect and generosity.

&gt;Isn't god ""ALL LOVING, ALL FORGIVING?""

No. The gods are capricious, jealous, vengeful. They can also be just, merciful, and generous. But they are not ""all"" anything.

&gt;God only seems to demand animal lives as sacrifices. 

No, plenty of cultures also demand human sacrifices.

&gt;What makes humans superior to animals?

Many belief systems would say that we are descended from the Gods in a way that animals are not. Our right is one of kinship, if nothing else.

"I am sorry if my opinion came across as generalizing too much. I don't think anyone can neatly fall into category A or B. I used to, regrettably, post rebuttals out of anger at the seemingly brokenness of this subreddit. I used to generalize expats as all losers who couldn't get jobs at home and have come to exploit China so they don't deserve to bitch about it. The more I think about it, however, I think that is the wrong approach. My dad taught me once no one chooses to leave their own country and home without thinking it will make them better. This applies to refugees, immigrants, and even expats. I think people on this subreddit are not all negative people, they are just regular people who are often perceived as negative.

"Yes, you fucked up.

The guy is loaded and obviously already had some experience with gold diggers. Hence he is VERY careful about women. He has a kind heart and is a sensitive personality which probably gets easily hurt in a relationship. This is the reason he has just a handful real friends at best. Money doesn't have the same value to him, instead he has very high requirements for people he considers respectable enough to let into his life. Hence he kept you at arms length until he gets more comfortable with you. His generosity towards your family shows: He would have spent money on you! So he tested your personal stand on money: Is it important to you? Gold diggers are very smart in denying that, hence he has to be very cunning with his testing.

And there's where you fucked up: Once you heard he's loaded and generous but not generous on *YOU*, you got sad, jelous, felt neglected and all that. You ""hinted"" (aka ""blackmailing with feelings"") you wanted a part of that wealth to be spent on you. He made his views clear to you (""No money spend on you""), still you were questioning them.

"So, I'm currently running the 'Way of the Wicked' adventure path, and there's quite a lot that's comparable to this. Minor WotW book 1 spoilers ahead, doing my best to avoid specifics.

During book 1, the players are tasked with weakening the ability of a keep to defend itself. A list of possible approaches are listed to the DM, mostly how players might sneak in, how they might cause tension between people in the keep, and a few other things. While the DM can hint at these things and they're certainly going to be useful to the PCs, it would take a group of PCs with a very relevant skill-set to actually complete this objective with just the book's offerings.

They might be able to find a valley they could lure it into for an ambush, also, let them be creative).

"Your dad pretty much nailed it.  Period.

Expanding some though ...

MCs (main characters) should have a relevant bio worked out.  Everything your dad said.  You need to know what makes them them (not a typo).  Where are they from, what major events have shaped their lives?  Are they impatient or calm?  Bold or shy?  Vanilla or chocolate?

The trick is not to write down every single little thing about the MCs ahead of time in your notes.  What you're doing is building them so that when you ask yourself that **all important question while writing**, ""what would (this character) do / say / think now?"", they can answer you.  Enough needs to have been built so that answer can be given and make sense within the context of the character.  If it doesn't, if it can't, then flesh the bio more.

I built an apocalypse story and featured a suburban mom as one of my protagonists.  I knew where she was born, who she'd married, what she did, her personality.  When the apocalypse started, she was hesitant and terrified.  Violence, guns?  Monsters?  Run, scream, hide.  Be scared of the gun just as much as of the monsters.  She was nice and generous, but now that the world was falling apart, all she cared about was saving her daughter.  Before she'd do a lot to help people, tolerate a lot from them.  Afterwards, she just wanted to survive and was willing to walk away from people begging for help no matter how sorry she felt for them.

Another of the protagonists was (more of) a stereotypical veteran military guy.  Same book, same circumstances.  He called up an old friend of his who was still in the service and volunteered, almost begged, to attach to his unit and dive into the middle of a major city when everyone else was trying to get out as fast as they could, because he was the guy who'd die trying to help.

I've written other books that follow that one, sequels.  In them, minor characters that were literally just extras in the first have evolved into MCs because they became more and more important to the ongoing story.  As they grew, I built more things about them that I knew so I could write them properly.  The sketch bio became meatier out of necessity.  Before I just needed a general idea of who they were; but later I needed to expand it to know where they'd been, what they'd done, who they were.

Start with your MCs, follow the basics, build structure and character arcs, fill the roles with extras (because that's what the other characters are; *extras*), and see what happens.  When some of those extras become important, you expand them and keep writing.  That's how it works.

I will say that supporting extras, those that get lines any more complicated than pure reaction stuff like ""run"" ""oh my god"" ""come on"" ""that'll be $7.42 please"" and so on, those I usually come up with a paragraph or so of sketch bio for them.  I'll add to it as I write, as things come up.

For example, one ""extra"" that evolved into a more major supporting character started out as ""National Guard Soldier, artillery MOS.""  As I wrote, she turned into a coffee and cigarette addict.  She was irritable and irreverent.  She took zero shit off anyone, even ranking superiors.  As I wrote, I added notes to her bio.

I had one story where a reader asked me ""why is this (named an extra in a story) such an asshole; it's kind of funny.""  That extra was just a name, gender, age, when I cast him.  The moment the MC met him, he just abruptly became an asshole.  He was sort of helpful and wasn't a jerk or anything, he was just an ass about things as he played his part.

It's just how it works.  You build up the MCs, plan them, settle out how you want them to work and make sure their personalities and backgrounds and details match with what you want; and the others can just grow organically during the writing process.","she was nice and generous, but now that the world was falling apart, all she cared about was saving her daughter.","nice and generous","generous","but",FALSE,"nice and generous","nice",NA,NA,0,"reddit",0.48037,"thick_moral_concepts_POS","positive",NA,NA,"thick_moral_concepts"

"There was once a legendary karate master by the name of Kerkei. Master Kerkei was well known as a generous but strict teacher, and so was always pestered by potential students looking to get into his school. For each student, he always assigned a different task for them to gain entry.

As you can imagine, each assignment was based on their potential skill levels. Some were told to capture the feather of an owl while it was hunting prey. This was possible only because of a grove a few miles away the some owls lived in.

Others were told to steal a sapphire from the other schools idols. This tested their stealth and mobility. The final task always came down to peanuts. You would think getting peanuts is no big deal, but these were very rare, highly treasured, and extremely guarded by none other than the Emperor's personal guard. The students would have to get into the palace, deal with the guards, break into the personal storage room, and bring back the peanuts without breaking any of the shells. Needless to say, this was reserved only for the most skilled applicants.

This is why Master Kerkei always only had a handful of students.

"OP you seem like the sort of person who is extremely trusting and generous. Also rich - or just profligate with your spending on your friends!

People can exploit that trait. Don't be overly generous with your friends - it's ok to be a bit generous, but big money hand outs can lead people to hang out with you just to get a but of money.

I'm going to say straight out that you made a rookie error getting involved with a girl who feely admitted to you at the start that she had a crush on someone else. That was stupid behaviour. I also don't understand why you feel like it is your duty to tell your bro that the girl you are interested in is interested in him if you also have intentions of getting with her. 

Having threesomes/open relationships is supposed to add physical variety to a relationship - but if you know that your girlfriend had a crush on someone else then facilitating sex between her and that person is effectively giving her away to him. You might have some agreement in place that stipulates that that shouldn't occur - but in practical terms it's going to happen.

I believe that you probably can't trust your gf or your bro not to have sex with each other any more since you have - with your actions - brought them together. Keeping them apart is actually a bit mean. Unless you're going to marry this girl  you should assume that the relationship had a use by date and since your bro already has an opportunity to be happy witt this girl for a while you should give him a turn since you're already had a turn. At present you're an obstruction between them - unless you bow out and let them be together it's going to be awkward between you because you're choosing to thwart their happiness for your own feelings. 

You're not separating your financial life from your friendships enough. Why are you giving your bro do much money just to play music? Why give him such heavy discounts just because he's you like him? If he isn't concerned about ripping you off, then perhaps he's putting his own interests ahead of yours too much to really be considered a friend. I think you're leaving yourself open to get played by people.  Thus whole situation is weird - nobody is respecting each other's boundaries.

"This happened yesterday but I will be living with the emotional scar for the rest of my life, and the physical scar for a few more days.

As a late but generous birthday gift, I bought my girlfriend her first dildo - a whopping eight incher. It arrived earlier in the day, before the time for appropriate shenanigans, so as soon as we opened it, we decided to proceed with some more SFW fun.

We aren't peasants so we got a *suction* dildo, so of course we did what any aristocrat would do and stuck it on any available surface. This started harmlessly with the furniture, the walls, and whatever other random objects were around. Soon enough, we got bored of that, and started exploring more... exotic places. Namely my forehead. With a good *thwack*, I stuck it loud and proud as a glorious silicone unicorn horn, and took some fun pictures for posterity.

After a few minutes of good wholehearted laughter and enough dicking around, it was time to move on. What I failed to realize was that I might have stuck it a little *too* hard to my forehead, and it didn't come off with a quick tug. A few pulls later and my second penis was still gripped to my face. After enough work to make a plumber proud, I managed to yank it off. Some more laughs and we were done.

Later, after my gf got a good look at my face, she paused and told me to look in a mirror. I came face to face with the consequences of my actions, the plunging of my forehead. The incredible suction paired with many tugs at the skin left a sizeable bruise on my forehead, about the size of two quarters. I've spent today hiding away from my roommate, and leaving my hair down.

I can never go outside again, lest my shame consume me.

Meet your new pal, the character issues creation questionnaire. Role-play should add humor and goals, and give you fun quirks that while they hamstring you, force you out of your comfort zone.

I had always done sword n board or stealth archer. My first time with this I rolled a Breton with zero weapon skills. Archmage. Moral. Kind. And complete lawful good. Alteration and restoration. Gardens. Generous but prideful. That was Clemence. Such a great play through.

Now I'm a vampire who has been told by a friend who is a seer, to leave Cheydinhal, to go north and find the 'boy with black eyes' (a mod follower with a quest). Elanna Virane (not her birth name but one chosen as have ones prior so she can't inherit stuff from herself every generation or so). She is a stoic, except when it comes to food and blood. Better Vampires + iNeed to help make possible her gluttony in terms of taste sensations. Loathes other vampires as they could only serve to draw attention and pitchforks against her. No loyalty to anyone save two people who have been left behind in Cheydinhal. Last came to Skyrim fifty odd years back. Revels in extremes, but doesn't allow herself the pleasure often. Never complains. A sense of noblesse oblige. Ridiculous love of clothes. Hoarder of blood potions and bear mett. Terrified of falmer. Doesn't love history as a subject but studies it with fervor, out of the desire to see patterns emerging, to create some sense of control.

It creates options and combinations you might not think up yourself. 

By having Elanna constantly distracted by a bandit over there and her craving for blood...and her fear of any sort of sleeping around people...I'm not ever on autopilot. Elanna has me thinking in a way foreign to my own. And even if I have seen Skyrims quests, *she hasn't*.

"I serve Steve Buscemi quite regularly at my diner.  (And yes, Mr. Pink tips perfectly fine--not exorbitant, but perfectly fine.)

I also serve the rapper Common.  I know him as Rashid (I don't know that that's the correct spelling).  Actually, lately he tends to send his driver over to pick up his food.  He's a really unbelievably sweet man.

Years ago, when Mike Tyson fought some hapless moron on pay-per-view, I went to a theatre party in NYC to watch it.  It was being thrown by a chorus person in a Broadway show that happened to be starring Sarah Jessica Parker.  She and Matthew Broderick happened to show up to the party and we sat next to each other on the floor.  We hurled snarky comments at the screen together for the ten minutes that we were seated (Tyson dispatched the guy in a minute and a half).  Very funny people, I thought.

As for the other people I've met, it depends on what you consider fame.  To me, some of them were very important.

Robyn Hitchcock--twice.  Talked with him and the Egyptians after a show in '93.  Bantered with him about what make of cheese grater he was playing on a song called ""Wafflehead"".  And then, when the Soft Boys reunited, I ran into him on a side street near Irving Plaza in NYC.  I told him to have a good show, and he said he'd try.

I met Luna (the band).  They came into my diner, too.  Dean Wareham claimed he had heard of my band at the time, which was sweet and generous but not bloody likely, as we'd only played one show at the time.

Gary Oldman, again, in my diner.  Very nice.  Ordered an omelette, laughed at my jokes.  That's all I ask for in a customer.

Former NJ Governor Tom Kean (yes, a Republican, but an incredibly nice guy) was the president of Drew University when I was a student there.  He was unflaggingly supportive of the arts, and theatre in particular, and as I was always acting, we became quite friendly.

I went onstage with Ricky Jay once, as an audience volunteer.  Does that count?  I got some laughs when he asked me what was in my pockets.  I was sick that week, so I said, ""Snotrags.""

Kristin Hersh of Throwing Muses and I talked guitar sounds.  She really lit up.  I think everyone else that had been waiting in line for her at the record store just smeared adulation on her or something, so a conversation about actually making music was welcome.

And my band opened for a lesser-known band called the Redwalls at the Knitting Factory.  They seemed nice, but drunk.  I had been a fan for a number of years before we played with them, but barely got to talk to them because we're way too poor to get someone to work our merch table.

"I often debate whether it is a blessing or a curse to be able to tell with ease and clarity when someone is lying. I am not an expert on body language or tells of deception, although over the years I have come to notice patterns. Before I even fully understood what lying was and why people would lie I could feel something different when I heard untruths.

Early Christmas' were intensely confusing. I would often feel uneasy around people. I never knew much about lying and deception so had not learned to link this feeling with that yet, so it was just confusing how people were jovial and generous but somehow upsetting.

It was through school I'd really honed my powers. Got to understand that what I was sensing was always related to deception. I would listen to kids telling their stories about why they could not do homework, or swear they were sorry and would not do it again. I'd listen to the teacher making hollow threats and class members making equally hollow indications of acquiescence.

Other than learning about my ability to perceive deception, and testing and confirming both that mines was strong and others significantly weaker, I had little interest in school. I would sometimes just start trouble so I could be kicked out of class and go to the place where all the other kids that had been kicked out of class went. These were the ones most liable to be lying and interesting to listen to.

I remember a teacher telling me he thought I'd amount to nothing, he was telling the truth. He was wrong, however. At 16 I'd managed to acquire a fake I.D and learned the basic rules of poker. I began to play in various pubs and casinos in low stakes poker games. It took me a while to get good at the game but from the very outset I knew when people were trying to deceive me. I'd made close to $100,000 by the time I was 18 and could use my own I.D. By this time I was somewhat micro famous, making this slightly awkward.

Then there are moments like this.

It often strikes me how many times people lie by mentioning the specific thing they want to hide. It would have been so easy for them to say, ""I do not have horns coming out my head"", or any number of various hyperboles. No. They picked ""alien"".

The best way to describe it when someone lies in a very unexpected way, with my sense of things, is like if you were to walk out on a road that seemed safe to cross, only to hear screeching brakes right beside you. The word ""alien"" making me almost physically jump in astonishment. I managed to contain myself, I've become phenomenally well practised in doing so, one has to to avoid too much attention.

""Not from Mars then, no?"" I try to keep it light-hearted but I do want to confirm.

""Nope, not me"", he replies. He is telling the truth.

I notice how dumb a question it was. I should have went with something more broad. Mars is one of the few places that apparently we (they) know a bit about and probably doesn't have complex creatures. I search my mind for a more tactful way to probe further.

""Just always been an Earthling, huh""?

""Is there anything else to be""?

Damn it! The old answering the question with the question. This really throws me off. His answer is not lying but it is not an answer. It implies we all know the same answer. This was a good deflection. I thought I'd had him well cornered with the ""earthling"" thing.

""Do you think aliens exist?""

""Maybe""

I cock my head at him and he turns away, acting like he is busying himself with organising some papers scattered across a coffee table.

I am not sure now to proceed. I do not know how they would react if I was to convince them I knew they were indeed an alien. What if they are not alone? What if this one is rather nice and friendly but me confronting the alien issue alerted other less friendly aliens?

""Don't you think it'd make sense there'd be something somewhere out there""?

""I can see why you'd think that"".

Ooh. For the first time I notice it. How through all the time I have known them, they have been side stepping so many questions so as to remain neutral or change the subject. This must be how I have not noticed anything before.

""What do you think""?, I think it is time to get pointed.

""What makes you think I think anything about it?""

OMG, this is like chess!

I just shrug, and fall silent as I contemplate what has just happened.

There are aliens. Furthermore, I know one. Further still, my unique powers work on aliens as well as humans. I try to remain humble but there are some considerations this may just make me the most deception aware advanced entity in the universe. Maybe not, but one step closer.

""You still thinking about aliens?"",  my friends voice bursts into my thoughts.

""Would you tell me if you were an alien? Hypothetically speaking?""

They take a couple seconds, then catch me off guard with a chuckle.

""I don't think anyone ever gets away with lying to you, do they""?

At first I am annoyed they have dodged the question and it takes a few seconds to sink in that they are telling the truth. That they must know! I feel heart beating faster, and I stumble for something to reply.

""But would you tell me?"", it is all I can think of. As I say it, it sounds dumb coming out of my mouth.

""If you were an alien, would you?""

They give me a fleeting knowing look, then turn on their heels grabbing their coat and starting towards the door.

""Got to get off, got a spaceship to catch"".

I sense no deception, but them being an alien is the least confusing part of all this now.

Thank you to everyone for their feedback, votes and the 2x gold. Much appreciated.

I found this a lot of fun to write and was considering writing a part 3. However, upon consideration I think it would probably be a lot more fun to write the backstory, the discovery and development of the lie detection power, the initial meeting of “alien friend” and then the follow on from what is written here.

I was thinking about doing this in ongoing blog posts spanning over a few months or something, with altering perspectives between the two characters.

If you’d be interested in reading this, shoot me a message and will let you know once the first parts are up.

"&gt;The ultimate logical end of such a system is the devolution of power to individuals; ie, the antithesis of dictatorial absolutism. Which is it to be?

Your error is understandable. After all, thanks to our tribal background we're hardwired to think in terms of leader figures. Never does it occur to us that we could have a process, a system, in stead of an individual leader.

We constantly place our trust in non-democratic systems, in which specialists are key elements. Yet our political process is a jumble of fallacies and manipulation just because we're too afraid to see our own limitations.

&gt;Where on earth did you get the idea that everyone agrees with the majority? Majoritarianism is a known danger in democratic systems. History is littered with demagogues who ruled through inflaming the mob. Many of them went on to be garden-variety tyrants, too.

I agree. The concept of a majority being more right than a minority (the backbone of the democratic concept) is extremely flawed and even detrimental for our progress.

&gt;Did I? I don't recall assuming any such thing. I'm talking about the dangers of dictatorship, no matter how well intentioned. Personally I reckon I would be a most excellent dictator; wise, educated, compassionate, judicious and generous. But it would not be me. It is almost certain that a psychopath would sooner or later take that throne. No bloody thankyou.

I agree that an old-fashioned dictatorial system is not desirable. However, a democracy is even worse.

&gt;I don't trust civil servants either. I'm talking directly about the ancient hope for an enlightened tyrant.

&gt;If you want to discuss the weaknesses of democracy, bureacratism, technocracy et al then we can talk about those. But the weakness of other systems is not an advantage of dictatorship. So straw-manning the hell out of democracy is not the way to prosecute your case.

The only way to judge the desirability of a governmental process is to compare it to its alternatives.

&gt;No, what they have is the avenue to exhaust their lust for power through peaceful means. This is the genius at the core of democratic politics: it changes government through ballots, not bullets. It lets power-hungry maniacs beat on each other with the minimum possible harm to everyone else. There's still harm - a lot of harm - but compared to civil war it's a doddle.

The genius of the democratic process is that it allows for a powerful elite to reign with total legitimacy.

In no way shape or form do the elected upper class (those few with the means to get elected) represent the people.

In a theoretical system where the governmental process HAS to choose the best options the government derives legitimacy from being right, whereas in a democracy the ruling elite derive legitimacy from being popular.

&gt;Such as?

There are certain interpretations of technocracies/meritocracies which could serve to get rid of the hurdle of succession (and many other issues) and prove to be much superior to democracy.","personally i reckon i would be a most excellent dictator; wise, educated, compassionate, judicious and generous.","judicious and generous","generous","but",FALSE,"judicious and generous","judicious",NA,NA,0,"reddit",0.28394,"thick_moral_concepts_POS","positive",NA,NA,"thick_moral_concepts"

"That, and to make me happier (the number 1 reason for me is to be happy; the more the better), to slow down my train of thoughts, to not ever feel desperate about life when I get old, to be able to feel a deep compassion for everyone, to better myself, to deal with my nihilism in a good way, to help deal with life's problems by being in the present and not doing anything I might regret, to keep my brain in good shape, and there might be more reasons I'm not remembering. Oh, and because it's fun, yet always challenging.

I started getting interested because of the positive scientific studies about the people who practice meditation. I had read that Einstein and Nietzsche had an intellectual respect for Buddhism, so that piqued my interest as well. Then I read about Secular Buddhism and one of Sam Harris' article about Buddhism (the famous militant atheist who, although I'm not fond of him, I respect intellectually) and that's when I decided to learn about it in-depth and (try to) practice it regularly.

I haven't developed a 'spiritual' outlook, because nobody agrees on what the word 'spiritual' means any more. It has helped me to comprehend more fully followers of the Abrahamic religions, because those religions have a good deal in common with Buddhist thought, but I see it as a fatal flaw that they decide to work on their compassion for everyone via dedicating themselves to 'god' instead of having a detached love for everyone; if you stop believing in god the whole system falls apart, and it makes people do silly things to keep up that belief (that is, faith). They also talk a lot that you should be, for example, kind and generous, but never bother to detail realistic ways to achieve those qualities, unlike Buddhism does.

I see (Buddhist) meditation as a sort of mental techniques whose primary goal is to achieve extreme happiness, and I think that, in conjunction with Buddhist philosophy, it is very effective at that.

"Yes, we need to allow people to accumulate wealth because they are the ones, generally, who are able to start/fund businesses which help employ poor folk. This is important. 

But I don't agree that only rich people create jobs or that they spend the most money. 

1. If you have a generous but FAIR/HONEST welfare system, this can potentially help the downtrodden get back up on their feet, go back to school/better their life instead of slave away for the rest of their life at the bottom. The problem is created when people go on welfare for their entire life and never contribute to society. We should work on fixing welfare.

2. A ton of rich people hoard money and buy useless luxury items. My grandpa (very rich, ran his own company.. exactly like ur grandpa) spent money on jewelry for his second wife, and spent all his money on books that he never read. His house is filled with unopened, giant books. Is this helping spur economic activity in the long run? Are those books going to do anything? When poor people spend money, they help local economies and the money goes back in the system. 

3. Taxing a person who makes millions a year at a higher rate (a few % points) is not going to affect them in any way. The difference between giving the government 100k more is nothing. They spend 100k like nothing. This is why Adam Smith, a huge proponent of capitalism, understand that taxing a poor person more could honestly drive that person/family into ruin, whereas taxing a rich person will, at best, cause them to buy 5 less luxury items per year.","if you have a generous but fair/honest welfare system, this can potentially help the downtrodden get back up on their feet, go back to school/better their life instead of slave away for the rest of their life at the bottom.","generous but fair","generous","but",FALSE,"generous but fair","fair",NA,NA,1,"reddit",0.54675,"thick_moral_concepts_POS","positive",NA,NA,"thick_moral_concepts"

"You're welcome and I do hope you find, well, some way forward that leads to more cooperation and understanding. It can be really hard but I suppose all things that are worth the while are.

Warning of more rambling nonsense that might or might not be relatable.

The ""grow to be comfortable with not being me"" part is something which, now I think about it, took me a long, long time to accept. It started, well, decades ago, back when I was still a teenager, after I realized I had to keep my ""imaginary friend(s)"" secret. That thread of ""dealing with myself"" sort of silently permeated my life as an undercurrent I never even realized was there. Probably the hardest part of the entire experience so far has been realizing that Kira is nothing like me and that's a good thing. It feels so odd when Kira takes over and just acts differently, from how she speaks to how she carries our body to what she thinks and does. So many things I don't like or can't get excited about, she's all over the moon about, and she has so many interests. It's amazing to be honest.

Earlier in life, the only way to deal with her presence was to black out but that was an overall terrible experience. It didn't only happen drunk. It also happened in daily life and I wouldn't know what had happened. Just sort of suddenly be somewhere and it would feel so strange. Long before I knew about DID I learned to notice the ""beginning of the funny feeling"" (i.e. switching) and get away from anyone who might notice; this did not always work so I started to hide away. Later on, I'd wake up to messages and posts I could have sworn couldn't come from me. My mid-20s are full of memories of weird moments like that and I had no conception of what was happening. I thought my life was coming undone and I was going insane. No explanation made any sense. I just became ""so weird"" and different for no reason.

Towards late 20s I began to warm up to the explanation of DID but it was still so hard. I had an aversion since early childhood in that regard, since people really notice I'm not me (it's hard to not notice; we're polar opposites with a few shared interests). Add to that the feminine behavior, which I for the longest time repressed out of fear, since I got teased for that a lot as a kid. I had no clue why any of this was an issue for me and didn't make the immediate connection to DID even after I suspected. I never really remembered ""being different"". I just knew I ""got weird"" and that was a bad thing. I never told anyone of course because I was so afraid. It really stressed me out for a long while and the fact I'd get ""stupid"" or ""hurtful"". This would happen with or without alcohol, with seemingly no rules as to when it would occur, and that eroded a lot of my sense of identity. I'm not like that! Why do I suddenly act like that? 

Sometime late last year, I slowly began to accept that this is simply how I am, how we are, and this year after a stupid internal spat it really clicked. There's something raw and beautiful about seeing Kira be herself; she feels very comfortable in our body, which was a complete shock to me. She suffered from dysphoria for years, crippling at times, and I thought that was it: she'd always resent this life. I knew she liked me, even back in the days she was a horrible monster to me, but I thought that was always abstract; an excuse to cling to. Later, when I learned about DID, I saw her role as that of persecutor turned disgruntled protector, and figured it was that. Only after did it dawn on me that she's actually embraced this existence to the fullest and I'm way behind her on that curve. She saw what life is like and decided she wanted more of that, in every way, for all of us, and was going to drag me along, kicking and screaming, until I finally understood what she'd seen years ago.

Kira's emotions in particular are utterly overwhelming rushes of genuine ""her"" that are well beyond me. Everything goes all over like a bouncy ball; she's so natural when allowed to be, with everything that makes her unique spilling out with everything she does. The first few times I really saw her for who she was confused me. I had only seen glimpses in the past, most of them bad or worrying. It took me so much courage to stand up to her when things got really bad. I thought I would have to do that for the rest of my life and, man, that idea really drained me. Kira isn't someone you can stand up to continually; she's way too strong and can argue endlessly and never run out of steam or excuses. She's never wrong unless she's wrong to prove how much wronger you are. Hopeless, I thought. Then I caught a fragment of someone telling her how special she is; some random dude at a bar, the last time we went out about two years ago. No reason for him to say that. He pointed out he wasn't gay or bi but felt he had to say that anyways. That really made me stop and think.

Some random guy can actually see Kira for what she is and is impressed enough to tell her that, in front of a bunch of other people. Then I realized: I'm really missing out. I have to stop messing up who she is and let her be her. Anything else would be cruel and I was too hard on her in the past. No one ever accepted her. Ever. Everyone always had something to criticize and I was no different. I had to figure out how to break that cycle and at first I failed. Utterly screwed up what I thought I was doing and drove us to the brink of falling apart. I really did not understand. But she forgave me and somehow poked and prodded until I finally caught on.

This year, for the first time, I actually saw all of her and it's utterly alien to me in such a strange, unnerving, and wonderful way. Shortly after that, Sarah came out of her shell and is now all but inseparable from Kira. She hasn't fronted yet but they're such a hopeless pair; two different strains of pure emotion and stupidity wrapped up in what I can only call adorable. Thinking about how silly they get makes me smile. 

I used to think Sarah was the genuine and heartfelt one, shy but generous. But she isn't; she's got a tiny heart with barely any space for anyone in it, while Kira goes out of her way to make people she thinks deserve it welcome, even though she's the most prejudiced person I know. No wonder so many people put up with her ""nonsense""; she can be a mess but also such a great person. She's just really genuine and says what she means and never apologizes for who she is. She's also so kind and caring when she wants to be and never runs out of things to say. Sure, she can be horrible, downright cruel, but she isn't usually. Most of the time she just wants the people she cares about to be happy. She never runs out of energy, ever, no matter how bad things get or how hopeless everything seems. I didn't want to see that for so long. I was fixated on the negatives. I was really shackled by that fear of ""not being me"". Turns out I actually really like ""not being me"". It's such a relief because the main ""other me"" is actually a great person. Maybe not all the time but that's okay. We're not perfect and I've sort of given up trying to be that. I prefer us how we are. I think if we were perfect we'd be boring and lifeless. One perfectionist in the system is enough.

It's good to have alternatives and I don't want to hold us back. I'd be doing this system and the woman who held it together against all odds, through all the darkest times of our lives, a disservice if I did. She deserves better and I want to be better. Not perfect; just better.

I'm not sure what the take-away here is. I guess that it's a really long and bumpy process and I totally understand why people find it hard. I had so much trouble with it myself and I'm still not as far along as I want to be. I also guess, especially when I think back to where I started out years ago, when I found out about DID, it all seemed so impossible. Denial and doubt and fear and confusion and nothing made sense. I could see the explanations, rationally, but I couldn't feel ""right"" with this whole mess. I had no idea what do to and, more recently, I found out Kira didn't either; she kept pushing for something, anything, and trial and error until we figured one another out. I never realized how afraid she was to lose me, or that we'd fail and slide back to the way things used to be, or any of it. She just inspired so much confidence that eventually I figured ""yeah, if anyone can figure it out, it's her, no matter how weird she is"". I guess way back when I expected a roadmap. Or to make progress in therapy towards a goal that would be measurable. What actually happened is we went all over the place and made all sorts of mistakes until we sort of stumbled onto a better solution and we're still working on that. I suspect this is the case for most things of this sort. I'm not sure. It's definitely not what I expected in any ways but it might give a bit of hope: even if you don't have it figured out, and even if everything goes sideways, there's always some way forward. You'll no doubt go a different path, in different circumstances, and that is a good thing! 

I can't believe I'm saying that and actually meaning it. I'm such a technical person: do this and then that. But it's true. There's no one size fits all solution and any way one goes is worth it, if only to figure out ""yeah, okay, that didn't work - let's try something else instead"".","i used to think sarah was the genuine and heartfelt one, shy but generous.","shy but generous","generous","but",FALSE,"shy but generous","shy",NA,NA,0,"reddit",5e-05,"thick_moral_concepts_POS","positive",NA,NA,"thick_moral_concepts"

"I saw that. what it proved was that they didn't bother to research what would be involved themselves. They didn't do investigation. They went straight to the lawyers in order to force Apple to write software for them. 

They want to force developers to write expressions for them. It reminded me of my friend Tibor. Tibor was an elderly artist who I knew in Venice California. All of his artwork when I knew him were expressions of Sentiments of Peace, Joy, love. He lived with a very pretty, very sweet 20 year old hippie girl. I think they were really in love. He often would invite myself and other Venice artists like Sonny Zorro, for instance, to his house for dinner and would give the homeless ones handfuls out of his jar full of silver coins. He was a very good man.

When he was a young man in Poland the Nazis forced Tibor to draw propaganda posters. He was a great artist and drew some very effective propaganda.

"Full disclosure, I struggle with this also.  While I haven't beaten it, I do have it managed to a level which doesn't set me back.  

&gt; free food, which is pretty much ""eat what you can now!""

Yes, but we're calorie restricted, so that food isn't free.  It comes out of our budget -- it's just not dollars in the budget, it's calories.  

Some random thoughts:

* quantity is not quality -- there is no added merit in large portions of merely average food.  This holds true even if the food is great -- there's nothing in that second helping that wasn't in the first.  If you're spending your calories and going for seconds, make it something else that is not everyday store-bought junk-food junk.
* at least half of what is being served is below average, by mathematical law -- so shop wisely.
* crowds and noise make me eat quickly (and overeat) -- so I'm not going to put a lot on my plate.  I am going to put one thing and a small amount of it, and then go socialize a while away from the food as I enjoy slowly.  I'm not going to let the frenetic activity cause me to rush through the food and subtract from my enjoyment of it or the event.  
* you're probably going over budget anyway -- give yourself a generous but reasonable allowance and ""save up"" for the event by eating lightly in the days before and right after the event.  I've found that I'm never hungry for breakfast the day after a party -- I'm still satiated from the night before.  There's a few hundred calories right there.  And I can sometimes eat light all day on the day of the party knowing that I'm going to go a little heavier (including a drink) at the party.  
* the goal is to lose weight and live your life at the same time.  You have to balance these -- eating lighter than you used to but not cutting yourself off.  Balance is hard and you may struggle, it's okay.  Just do your best but keep these two rules topmost
 * have fun, its a party
 * stay in control, its not a blank check

"&gt; Yes. Since I generally earn a lot more than my friends, nine times out of ten I pick up the check. When I'm out with coworkers that earn on the same order as I do, we either split or rotate picking up the tab.

My bad, I didn't state the question properly. What you do is called private charity. You voluntarily use your money to help those less fortunate. And the fact that you do it voluntarily should make you less cynical about assuming that you have to force others to be charitable for the good of society.

Forced charity is not a moral virtue. And it's even uglier if the implication behind it (and I'm not accusing you of this) is ""I'm being generous, so everyone else should too."" Because really what that means is the person saying that is not acting in the spirit of selflessness that is at the core of what it means to be charitable and generous.

But, the question should have read: ""When you go out to dinner, would you be offended if your friends suggested that you have an obligation to pay for them since you make more money?""

I trust you'll answer ""yes"" to that...

&gt; I just think that someone who nets six figures after taxes shouldn't be whining that someone who makes $20,000 a year needs to pay ""their fair share""

Who are these people who are complaining about that? I even said in my post, that it's reasonable for those with very low incomes to be relieved of their tax burdens by the rest of the taxpayers. And if you're arguing against Joe the Plumber, his complaint wasn't that the guy making $20,000 wasn't paying enough, it was that he was paying more than the people making $60,000 or $100,000. Which goes back to my previous post about whether there is anything fair about slapping a fixed tax percentage on people's incomes.

&gt; This is not about equity. This is not about what is ""fair."" This is about doing what's right. It is NOT right for someone earning minimum wage and barely getting by to pick up their ""fair share"" of federal obligations.

You are making an ends-justify-the-means argument. I agree with you, it's not ""right"" for someone making $12,000 to pay $1,000 in taxes. So that means that the $1,000 we want to relieve them of paying must either translate into a federal budget cut, or into higher taxes for the rest of us. My argument is, is it ""right"" to shift the $1,000 to the wealthiest 5%, or would the right thing to do be to shift it evenly to both the wealthiest 5% and the other 95% in the middle class who are still paying taxes?

My argument is that people like you are essentially saying ""this is not right that these poor people are paying such taxes. Therefore, we (the majority) will stick the rich people with the bill."" Again, you act as if the only option is for the rich to pay. If it's not, then the question must be asked why the hardship should be shouldered by the rich, just because they ""shouldn't be whining about how much money they make."" Even though they are likely wealthier precisely because they provide more jobs and goods/services to society than the middle class do.

It's important to resolve this question about whether it's right to take from the rich. Obama repeatedly talks about tax cuts for 95%. If there's an argument to be made that that is what's equitable, then lets pursue that. But otherwise, this is essentially a populous ploy, the majority oppressing the minority.

- Over the past 15 years Australia has permanently resettled more refugees per capita than any other country. (Yes, even under Howard Australia was still the highest per capita in the world).

- At the height of the boat arrivals, almost the entire refugee intake was taken up by boat arrivals since they were given priority over offshore refugee applications.

- The net effect of prioritising onshore arrivals was that at the arrival peak, only refugees with money (relatively speaking) were being given asylum. The most desperate had no chance at all.

- The “no advantage” policy was designed with the principle that if you arrive onshore you should get no advantage over those arriving offshore.

"**Gaucho**

Gaucho (Spanish: [ˈɡautʃo]) or gaúcho (Portuguese: [ɡaˈuʃo]) is a word with several meanings. According to the Royal Spanish Academy's authoritative Dictionary, in its historical sense a gaucho was ""a mestizo who, in the 18th and 19th centuries, inhabited Argentina, Uruguay and Rio Grande do Sul in Brazil, was a migratory horseman, and adept in cattle work"" In Argentina and Uruguay today a gaucho is, according to the same source, simply ""A country person, experienced in traditional livestock farming"". Because historical gauchos were reputed to be brave, if unruly, the word is also applied metaphorically to mean ""Noble, brave and generous"", but also ""One who is skilful in subtle tricks, crafty"". In Portuguese the word gaúcho (note the accent) means ""An inhabitant of the plains of Rio Grande do Sul or the pampas of Argentina descended from European man and [Amer]Indian woman who devotes himself to lassoing and raising cattle and horses""; and in Brazil gaúcho has also acquired a metonymic signification, meaning anyone, even an urban dweller, who is a citizen of the State of Rio Grande do Sul.

"Well, I think access to a developer is worth more than a dollar a month. You've been extremely responsive in the past, and that's worth $$. Though, seeing your reactions to what seem predictable comments in the other thread makes me fear that this app isn't long for this world. You're hoping to create a market where none previously exists, and a subscription model at that. You're swimming against the tide here, and your expectations should have been grounded accordingly. You've shown yourself to be quite thin skinned, and it would suggest that it wouldn't take much to push you over the edge of pulling the app somewhere down the line.

 I understand your need for compensation, and a sizable portion of the community agrees, even if it hasn't previously materialized into actual donations. Your initial thread posed the question of monetization, and what followed was a dozen threats to close down the app. A lot of your anger and frustration, justified or not, comes out of the blue for us. As others have pointed out, the initial selling point of your app was no ads. You've never talked about the need for monetization, so it took a lot of people by surprise. In one comment, you've mentioned that keeping sources current is a ongoing laborious process, and something that justifies an ongoing revenue stream. Fair enough, but how would we know if you've never told us this before today? AFAIK no other developers have pointed to this as a major time sink, so we assume collecting and testing sources is a simple task. People would assume that building the app is the major hurdle, and keeping sources current is mere administrative work.

She probably always acted this way, but because you seem to be a generous and giving person her whining and bitching sounded like a person in need of help and you responded accordingly. 

If there is one lesson to learn from this, it's never ""give"" things away without clearly ""expressing expectations and making boundaries"". 

The vast majority of people interpret getting something for ""free"" as meaning it is worthless both in terms of cost and effort by the giver. 

As you saw with your ex-friend, they will feel NO obligation to appreciate your gesture. In fact, many will feel a sense of entitlement because they are doing you a favor by accepting what they NEVER asked for. 

The worst of them will treat you like their parent who is obligated to giving them what they want.

You can still be kind and generous, but you need to be clear you are giving whatever because you CHOOSE to do this. You are NOT doing anything, because you feel obligated no matter what the other person thinks or says, and you will cease giving, Etc., the moment it turns into a hassle.

"I was in a wild club up in NYC a couple years back. I don't know what I was doing there, a couple of weird friends convinced me to go on vacation there. Especially for an introvert like myself there are much better places to go on vacation, but one night made the whole trip worth it.

So this club had music so loud you could barely hear a person screaming next to you with people jumping around and doing kinky shit that I didn't even know existed. I was definitely very out of place there and began to question why I have the friends that I do. My only option seemed to be to sit quietly at the bar and drink my unreasonably overpriced drink and hope the rest of the world had a good time.

But then, I heard a loud banging sound, even louder than the music. Someone had brought a gun to the club and just shot down another patron! People started screaming and running around trampling each other to get away, but the gunman kept firing. There was no good exit I could get to from my position that would not be running straight past him.

Then, I don't know what happened. It was like I wasn't even controlling my body anymore; I did not know what I was doing! I ran straight at the gunman. He was distracted and did not even notice me until just a second too late. I jumped on top of him and grabbed his wrist. In the surprise he dropped his gun on the floor. It was likely out of ammo by this point anyways. I kept on top and repeatedly punched him in the face for I don't know how long. But I let up the pressure on his arms just a little and he escaped reached in and pulled out another gun. I swatted the pistol as hard as I could sending the barrel into a turn around as it fired. Straight through the assailant's head.

I sat on top of the now dead crazed gunman for a moment, now stunned. Then I felt a hand on my shoulder. I turned around to see who it was and saw one of the most beautiful women I have ever seen in my life. She had dark, smooth skin, long dark hair, big beautiful brown eyes, all the right curves, the works. ""Come on,"" she said with urgency in her voice, ""the police always want someone living to blame. You don't want to be around when they get here!""

Had I been in a more reasonable state of mind I might have objected, but things as they were, I complied and followed her out the door and escaped the crowd. She brought me back to her apartment, where I found she was not only generous but horny. She gave me everything that night, and neither of us held back as we had the best sex I've ever had in my life.

So, it was really a series of things which got me out of my shyness, but that definitely helped.

"I've spent at least five years each in Boulder (Colorado), Boston, Houston, and a small town in southern Louisiana called Morgan City.  This was my impression:

Northerners in general were better educated and more interesting to talk to, but they were much more likely to be dicks.  Southerners were very friendly and generous but seemed significantly less...I'll say ""educated"", but what I really mean is exposed to and accepting of people not like themselves.  They were less cosmopolitan, and as a consequence, less accepting of gays, minorities and non-Americans.

Personally, I don't see a cultural issue here (except for the mean Northerners vs nice Southerners), but an economic one.  Honestly, I came to the South with a lot of prejudices, and it took me a while to realize that uneducated is not the same thing as stupid.  I learned a lot of respect for people that I would have just written off as ""dumb hicks"" before I lived around them.  

At the same time though- and this is Morgan City I'm mostly talking about here- lack of exposure to people who weren't also poor, white, christian, straight and southern really did seem to allow bigotry, prejudice and xenophobia to exist to a much larger extent than I saw outside of the South.

So, my answer is that the actual people aren't bad at all,  but that lack of exposure to gays/minorities/non-Christians/non-Americans really did seem to allow for ignorance and prejudice to be more acceptable in the culture.

edit: So, sure, there are people like this up North too.  In a nutshell, the qualities I didn't like seemed to be related to poverty, and there was more poverty in the South.

"I've tested games. These over-memed images are mostly BS.

&gt; Basically every video game tester is under an NDA (Non-disclosure Agreement) that basically states that they are not allowed to say anything about the game they are working on. Breaking this is the fastest way to get fired. That is also why this post will be vague and I won't answer any questions about what company or games I have worked on.

Yeah, and I have the same NDA on anything I work on as a tester. This is not unique to the gaming industry.

&gt; Normally, we are supposed to reproduce an issue before we even bother to let anyone know somethings broke. But in this case, the guy destroyed 4-5 consoles before he let anyone know. The consoles had to be sent back to the manufacturer and the guy got in alot of trouble.

/r/thathappened

&gt; Unless a company makes just 1 game, testers will get moved to any project. They like to have a mix of people that know how the game should work, and people that have no clue whats going on in the game. This way if something is off, the new people might catch it where the old people had seen the issue since the first iteration of the game so they didn't do anything about it.

Again, not unique to the gaming industry. Managers place you where you will be useful, not where you want to be necessarily. Sometimes you're placed where you want to be. I rarely worked on the actual game when I was a tester. I mainly tested the website.

&gt; I have seen some of the stereotypical neck-beards at work, but most of the people tend to be ages 18-40 and all races/genders. I have worked with people who are using this as their first job, and people who worked construction and decided their bodies couldn't take the strain anymore. I have worked with under-qualified and overqualified people. Everyone is generally great.

True of most programming and testing gigs. Again, not unique to the game industry.

&gt; Investors want returns and only invest enough money for a game to be developed for a certain amount of time. Wether that is 1 year or 6 years, eventually the money runs out and the game releases with whatever the developers could make in time. That is the main reason for DLC nowadays.

Source? AFAIK most game companies aren't public and don't have investors in the sense you describe.

&gt; Most entry jobs as a tester for the larger companies is contracted for 1 year to 18 months. This is due to multiple legal reasons and so that people have chances to find other jobs / so the companies can get new blood. Once you get experience though, you can get hired full time into the larger company and work until you choose to quit.

I laughed when I read *1 year to 18 months.* Where are you getting this bullshit?

&gt; More time can be spent on the game if less is spent on the testers. The job is simple and requires no higher education. There are chances for promotion, but there is almost no entry barrier into the field. But, its better than flipping burgers for the same amount of money.

Most testing gigs are minimum wage if you have no experience. Some game companies are more generous, but good luck surviving almost anywhere in California at $14/hr or less.

The job is very simple, but companies nowadays hire for culture fit too. You can't just walk into any company with no experience and get the job. You have to have a passion for the game, gaming, and the work involved in testing. What you described isn't how any of this works.

And if you think working in testing for small pay beats working in the service industry for small pay, I invite you to try both. I have. They both suck.

&gt; Whenever a popular game comes out, everyone loses their mind and *cough* *cough* can't come in due to a sudden illness. It's usually not bad until the managers start calling out as well. But the managers are usually smart enough to request the time off beforehand.

People in the game industry are way overworked. When a game is finally out, exhaustion kicks in just after relief. You can account for this if you track how many extra man hours it took to get the game out despite projections for the sprints. This happens in business software companies too, by the way. I repeat, *not specific to the game industry.*

&gt; We got into this field because we like video games and we like money, so we decided to combine them. You may get burnt out on a game or genre if you play it at work, but their are so many genres that we never get bored. But once we play a game for about 1500 hours before its released, please don't ask us to play it at home once its released. not many games can hold you after that long playing it.

This is some weird kind of self-vent. Not every game tester feels that way. For example, employees at Riot Games are frequently seen playing League of Legends in free time on streams and if you visit their office after-hours in the PC bang. They work on the game because they love it, and play it because they love it. YMMV.

&gt; The developers will continue to work once the game is set for Final. They fix all the major issues the game producer finds so that it can be made onto discs/setup for download. But they still have some time before they game launches so they start working on fixing other issues that were found and throw them out as a day one/day zero patch.

Oh, you have to support the game or software you made after it launches? Color me surprised.

I'm honestly not shocked that this got upvoted, especially given this subreddit's history, but I hate to see people misinformed about something I actually did for a living.","some game companies are more generous, but good luck surviving almost anywhere in california at $14/hr or less.","generous, but good","generous","but",TRUE,"more generous , but good","good","more",NA,1,"reddit",0.74339,"thick_moral_concepts_POS","positive",NA,0,"thick_moral_concepts"
"Your dad pretty much nailed it.  Period.

Expanding some though ...

MCs (main characters) should have a relevant bio worked out.  Everything your dad said.  You need to know what makes them them (not a typo).  Where are they from, what major events have shaped their lives?  Are they impatient or calm?  Bold or shy?  Vanilla or chocolate?

The trick is not to write down every single little thing about the MCs ahead of time in your notes.  What you're doing is building them so that when you ask yourself that **all important question while writing**, ""what would (this character) do / say / think now?"", they can answer you.  Enough needs to have been built so that answer can be given and make sense within the context of the character.  If it doesn't, if it can't, then flesh the bio more.

I built an apocalypse story and featured a suburban mom as one of my protagonists.  I knew where she was born, who she'd married, what she did, her personality.  When the apocalypse started, she was hesitant and terrified.  Violence, guns?  Monsters?  Run, scream, hide.  Be scared of the gun just as much as of the monsters.  She was nice and generous, but now that the world was falling apart, all she cared about was saving her daughter.  Before she'd do a lot to help people, tolerate a lot from them.  Afterwards, she just wanted to survive and was willing to walk away from people begging for help no matter how sorry she felt for them.

Another of the protagonists was (more of) a stereotypical veteran military guy.  Same book, same circumstances.  He called up an old friend of his who was still in the service and volunteered, almost begged, to attach to his unit and dive into the middle of a major city when everyone else was trying to get out as fast as they could, because he was the guy who'd die trying to help.

I've written other books that follow that one, sequels.  In them, minor characters that were literally just extras in the first have evolved into MCs because they became more and more important to the ongoing story.  As they grew, I built more things about them that I knew so I could write them properly.  The sketch bio became meatier out of necessity.  Before I just needed a general idea of who they were; but later I needed to expand it to know where they'd been, what they'd done, who they were.

Start with your MCs, follow the basics, build structure and character arcs, fill the roles with extras (because that's what the other characters are; *extras*), and see what happens.  When some of those extras become important, you expand them and keep writing.  That's how it works.

I will say that supporting extras, those that get lines any more complicated than pure reaction stuff like ""run"" ""oh my god"" ""come on"" ""that'll be $7.42 please"" and so on, those I usually come up with a paragraph or so of sketch bio for them.  I'll add to it as I write, as things come up.

For example, one ""extra"" that evolved into a more major supporting character started out as ""National Guard Soldier, artillery MOS.""  As I wrote, she turned into a coffee and cigarette addict.  She was irritable and irreverent.  She took zero shit off anyone, even ranking superiors.  As I wrote, I added notes to her bio.

I had one story where a reader asked me ""why is this (named an extra in a story) such an asshole; it's kind of funny.""  That extra was just a name, gender, age, when I cast him.  The moment the MC met him, he just abruptly became an asshole.  He was sort of helpful and wasn't a jerk or anything, he was just an ass about things as he played his part.

It's just how it works.  You build up the MCs, plan them, settle out how you want them to work and make sure their personalities and backgrounds and details match with what you want; and the others can just grow organically during the writing process.","she was nice and generous, but now that the world was falling apart, all she cared about was saving her daughter.","nice and generous","generous","but",FALSE,"nice and generous","nice",NA,NA,0,"reddit",0.48037,"thick_moral_concepts_POS","positive",NA,NA,"thick_moral_concepts"

"For 4. I hate to break it to you but Denna all but tells us she is a 'whore' or, if you want to be generous but still pejorative, a 'gold-digger'. Personally I wouldn't use those words though and pick something more neutral like 'escort', 'prositute' or the generic 'sex worker' or maybe coin a new term like 'professional companion'. But Denna is way more complex than that. I love her relationship with Kvothe and the ebb and flow of it and how similar they are, how much insight they show into one another yet how little they understand (or rather empathise, especially Kvothe) with one another. Some people are very biased against women, especially those who might be sex workers. I wouldn't put any stock in it.

For 1. Repetition a basic and fudemental feature of story-telling. Dramatic effect is also part of story-teller so I do not understand that. Kvothe himself likes to cast himself as unique and someone no-one can truly relate with. Meanwhile he refuses to reveal the secrets of his heart to anyone, even Denna, while he steals peaks at their's. I can totally see Kvothe, especially if it is young Kvothe speaking, not getting that other people's empathy is capable of much more than he ever gives it credit for. Hence using that phrase. That said, too much repetition can grate. But the fact you were able to reread the books several times before it began to grate (or it didn't grate enough to stop you enjoying the rereading) suggests he didn't get this entirely wrong persay.

The rest is fair game. I think they represent stylistic choices to an extent and Rothfuss is the kind of author who will obesses for months on how to get a single passage right but he still has to finish a book. Hence inconsistency in the writing. Most stories, especially of this length, are not consistent all the way through after all. But I totally get feeling the entire work suffers for the excessive attention lavished on some parts of it. But then no story is consistent. It's just not possible. Why would a story about stories be something stories are not? :P

As for the Wise Man's Fear. I've only read it 1 and 1/2 times so far. I'm sure the flaws will start popping around 5. Then again maybe not. I mean the Dark Elf Trilogy (one of my absolute favorite books growing up: I had them in one complete edition) is undoubtedly a flawed work. But I read that book so much it fell apart in my hands one day (and the pages were coming out before then). I read and read and read and to this day I could not list a single flaw in it. I was so caught up in the story that I could not step back to see the flaws, even those on one level I knew they existed.

"&gt; Yes. Since I generally earn a lot more than my friends, nine times out of ten I pick up the check. When I'm out with coworkers that earn on the same order as I do, we either split or rotate picking up the tab.

My bad, I didn't state the question properly. What you do is called private charity. You voluntarily use your money to help those less fortunate. And the fact that you do it voluntarily should make you less cynical about assuming that you have to force others to be charitable for the good of society.

Forced charity is not a moral virtue. And it's even uglier if the implication behind it (and I'm not accusing you of this) is ""I'm being generous, so everyone else should too."" Because really what that means is the person saying that is not acting in the spirit of selflessness that is at the core of what it means to be charitable and generous.

But, the question should have read: ""When you go out to dinner, would you be offended if your friends suggested that you have an obligation to pay for them since you make more money?""

I trust you'll answer ""yes"" to that...

&gt; I just think that someone who nets six figures after taxes shouldn't be whining that someone who makes $20,000 a year needs to pay ""their fair share""

Who are these people who are complaining about that? I even said in my post, that it's reasonable for those with very low incomes to be relieved of their tax burdens by the rest of the taxpayers. And if you're arguing against Joe the Plumber, his complaint wasn't that the guy making $20,000 wasn't paying enough, it was that he was paying more than the people making $60,000 or $100,000. Which goes back to my previous post about whether there is anything fair about slapping a fixed tax percentage on people's incomes.

&gt; This is not about equity. This is not about what is ""fair."" This is about doing what's right. It is NOT right for someone earning minimum wage and barely getting by to pick up their ""fair share"" of federal obligations.

You are making an ends-justify-the-means argument. I agree with you, it's not ""right"" for someone making $12,000 to pay $1,000 in taxes. So that means that the $1,000 we want to relieve them of paying must either translate into a federal budget cut, or into higher taxes for the rest of us. My argument is, is it ""right"" to shift the $1,000 to the wealthiest 5%, or would the right thing to do be to shift it evenly to both the wealthiest 5% and the other 95% in the middle class who are still paying taxes?

My argument is that people like you are essentially saying ""this is not right that these poor people are paying such taxes. Therefore, we (the majority) will stick the rich people with the bill."" Again, you act as if the only option is for the rich to pay. If it's not, then the question must be asked why the hardship should be shouldered by the rich, just because they ""shouldn't be whining about how much money they make."" Even though they are likely wealthier precisely because they provide more jobs and goods/services to society than the middle class do.

It's important to resolve this question about whether it's right to take from the rich. Obama repeatedly talks about tax cuts for 95%. If there's an argument to be made that that is what's equitable, then lets pursue that. But otherwise, this is essentially a populous ploy, the majority oppressing the minority.

"I applaud what seems like the first intelligent comment from you in this thread. 

Listen, I am anti-war -- I was against the stupidity in Iraq, and am fully against any acts of aggression towards Iran. But the past oh, 30+ years of history have not exactly been great for US-Iran relations. I actually love the country and the people of Iran, but I dislike its government and its rulers. I think it is a progressive nation stuck behind the veil of theocracy.

I am also against the Israeli occupation and think Israel is one of the top human rights' violators in the world. What it has done to the Palestinian people is hard to forgive, but of course the healing can only begin with relinquishing settlements, ending all occupation, and recognizing statehood. 

Obviously none of this is easy, and we're not going to hash out these problems in the Reddit comments.

My original comment to you, which started this, was taking issue with you saying ""nothing was said about the pyramids."" No, something was said. Will anything ever happen? Of course not. Morsi may be many bad things, but one thing he seems to be is a pragmatist, not a true zealot. Then you said the Salafis were an irrelevant minority; I provided you with multiple links showing they were not. Then you tried to explain the movement away; again, I addressed that. We are now far, far off topic.

However, I'll say this: with respect to the Salafis/Wahhabis in Egypt, I am sure there are many who are kind and generous, but unfortunately there are also **many** who are intolerant, cannot countenance Christianity, atheism, homosexuality in Egypt, and are not afraid to use violence when it suits them. I won't spend my day sending you links, but there is plenty of evidence that with Mubarak gone, Egypt has become even less welcoming for minorities. And the reason for that is a noticeable and public (and statistical) uptick in Salafi/Wahhabi influence, which can be seen in the media as well as in parliament.

I won't scrutinize these views on their merits. Salafis, Hindus, Christians, Jews, whomever, can believe what they want. But when the belief extends beyond the individual and starts to influence the environment and others against their will, that pisses me off. Unfortunately, that's what's happening in Egypt. I am not just some couchsurfing American FOX NEWS watcher. I have been to Egypt, know Arabic, have read the Quran, and have many friends in Egypt and elsewhere in that region. So take my assessment for what it's worth -- Egypt is in far greater peril with its current influences than America ever was with the (truly nominal) ""influence"" of people like Pat Freaking Robertson.","however, i'll say this: with respect to the salafis/wahhabis in egypt, i am sure there are many who are kind and generous, but unfortunately there are also **many** who are intolerant, cannot countenance christianity, atheism, homosexuality in egypt, and are not afraid to use violence when it suits them.","kind and generous","generous","but",FALSE,"kind and generous","kind",NA,NA,0,"reddit",0.69507,"thick_moral_concepts_POS","positive",NA,NA,"thick_moral_concepts"

"Personally, I don't think it's an interface problem, so much as it's a problem of my options after I've been discovered in stealth games. A lot of the time, if you fuck up stealth you're either dead, or you're fucked so hard on your resources (health, ammo, etc.) that reloading is really the only viable option unless you're playing on some kind of super forgiving difficulty where you get more resources later. I find that I'm frequently and paradoxically punished for choosing non-or less lethal all stealth builds or routes in many games because once I'm discovered, my options are to either die, or get hunted down and waste precious resources in the process. I loved it to death, but Deus Ex: Human Revolution is a good example of this. All stealth delivers the most reward in terms of XP, but baby Jesus help you if you alert enemies to your presence because you're either going to be mowed the fuck down or spend the next 10 minutes in a delicate dance of rounding corners and trying to evade shit until the enemies go back to staring at walls and patrolling long corridors with gigantic pauses at each end where they mostly just stare at the ceiling, and apparently can't see you hiding behind a box from 10 feet away.

It's a weird dichotomy. That being said, I don't mind so much, as I tend to view quicksaving as a way to get to know the game intimately. If I fail at one approach, I'll reload and try a few more, then combine my experiments into the best overall approach. Then, the next time I play the game, I'll be more informed and I can make different decisions based on my new build, or revisit the game with the same type of build and play through with more confidence, knowing what the game has to offer. 

In a way, I also view this kind of repetition in the same way I view dying a lot in games like Ghosts and Goblins or Megaman. There's a memorisation curve figured into the game and getting it right takes practise. Stretches, sequences or set pieces can sort of be viewed as stages in the level. I try to only quicksave or reload before long sequences of enemies or objectives or whatever. 

Ultimately, I would like to see a game that has a generous, but fair amount of resources, with a realistic form of stealth, evasion and combat that lets you evade enemies dynamically, rather than ""stealth, discovery, hide, wait out search and resume game"", or ""engage enemy, die or use up most of your resources"". A dynamic AI that doesn't simply rely on predictable patrol paths and search tactics would be nice. An option to run and hide in unorthodox places, stay hidden for real or be forced to find additional hiding places, or use convincing distraction to obfuscate and confuse your enemy until the AI actually gives up on looking for you would be good too. Honestly, I think The Last of Us did a pretty good job of this with the human AI, but the infected simply re-introduced this same problem (basically if a runner or a clicker sees you, reload your fucking game...).

"I don't think age has as much to do with it as mental state, and also with whether you question things and can incorporate new information.

I personally started out conservative, business school, Reagan loving, etc. But I became uncomfortable with the embrace of evangelicals and I was able to see that 'conservatives' consistently blew up the deficit and were more likely to start wars. 

As I read more and observed society around me, I became more comfortable in liberal circles. A lot of the conservatives around me were angry, bitter and stingy, while the liberals around me were more easy going, joyful and generous. 

But it's more about being comfortable with changing your views as you incorporate more and more information.

"Your post ended by talking about needing a backbone and by the comments thus far, we all support you in that. So you are on the right track, but we understand it’s easier said than done. 

You reminded me of when my husband had to put his foot down when my son was 18 mo and his grandpa (my sons great grandpa) was giving him snide comments about how to go easier on our son. (Ironically we were being much easier than he had ever been with his daughter, but I digress.)  This one specific day, he even bopped my husband on the head to make a point!  We left his house in a hurry with promises to never return until it was understood who was the parent here. It was very stressful as we were both raised to respect our parents... and grandpa wasn’t known to ask for forgiveness.

It took 3 days and he apologized in tears... one of the only times I saw him cry. He never crossed that line again. He is now gone and my son is 21 and we (including our kids born later) and our nephews all had healthy relationships with that grandpa for MANY years. It was WELL worth the immediate pain.  Bottom line there: Pick the battle!  

On that note...

First i would call your MIL and get her input on how this happened. She may not have gotten a clear story and may be innocent.  Confirm if she is interested in watching him the whole time. 

Take this serious enough to write out what you want to say to your parents ahead of time (even just some key points). What you’re expecting? What can they expect if they abide by that? Rude comments are passive bullying and should not be overlooked. This is YOUR child, it’s your job to find trustworthy care.  It’s a critical part of being a parent. 

Also include praise for some things they’ve done well. Try to “sandwich“ the hard between the praise.  

Discuss/Agree with your fiancé ahead of time and present this together with a unified front.  Even having a 3rd party trustworthy friend present can be helpful. It will help you stay centered and calm. Firm, but kind. 

Personally I would pray James 1:5 which is a dear promise where God says he WILL give us wisdom generously when we ask Him.

"I often debate whether it is a blessing or a curse to be able to tell with ease and clarity when someone is lying. I am not an expert on body language or tells of deception, although over the years I have come to notice patterns. Before I even fully understood what lying was and why people would lie I could feel something different when I heard untruths.

Early Christmas' were intensely confusing. I would often feel uneasy around people. I never knew much about lying and deception so had not learned to link this feeling with that yet, so it was just confusing how people were jovial and generous but somehow upsetting.

It was through school I'd really honed my powers. Got to understand that what I was sensing was always related to deception. I would listen to kids telling their stories about why they could not do homework, or swear they were sorry and would not do it again. I'd listen to the teacher making hollow threats and class members making equally hollow indications of acquiescence.

Other than learning about my ability to perceive deception, and testing and confirming both that mines was strong and others significantly weaker, I had little interest in school. I would sometimes just start trouble so I could be kicked out of class and go to the place where all the other kids that had been kicked out of class went. These were the ones most liable to be lying and interesting to listen to.

I remember a teacher telling me he thought I'd amount to nothing, he was telling the truth. He was wrong, however. At 16 I'd managed to acquire a fake I.D and learned the basic rules of poker. I began to play in various pubs and casinos in low stakes poker games. It took me a while to get good at the game but from the very outset I knew when people were trying to deceive me. I'd made close to $100,000 by the time I was 18 and could use my own I.D. By this time I was somewhat micro famous, making this slightly awkward.

Then there are moments like this.

It often strikes me how many times people lie by mentioning the specific thing they want to hide. It would have been so easy for them to say, ""I do not have horns coming out my head"", or any number of various hyperboles. No. They picked ""alien"".

The best way to describe it when someone lies in a very unexpected way, with my sense of things, is like if you were to walk out on a road that seemed safe to cross, only to hear screeching brakes right beside you. The word ""alien"" making me almost physically jump in astonishment. I managed to contain myself, I've become phenomenally well practised in doing so, one has to to avoid too much attention.

""Not from Mars then, no?"" I try to keep it light-hearted but I do want to confirm.

""Nope, not me"", he replies. He is telling the truth.

I notice how dumb a question it was. I should have went with something more broad. Mars is one of the few places that apparently we (they) know a bit about and probably doesn't have complex creatures. I search my mind for a more tactful way to probe further.

""Just always been an Earthling, huh""?

""Is there anything else to be""?

Damn it! The old answering the question with the question. This really throws me off. His answer is not lying but it is not an answer. It implies we all know the same answer. This was a good deflection. I thought I'd had him well cornered with the ""earthling"" thing.

""Do you think aliens exist?""

""Maybe""

I cock my head at him and he turns away, acting like he is busying himself with organising some papers scattered across a coffee table.

I am not sure now to proceed. I do not know how they would react if I was to convince them I knew they were indeed an alien. What if they are not alone? What if this one is rather nice and friendly but me confronting the alien issue alerted other less friendly aliens?

""Don't you think it'd make sense there'd be something somewhere out there""?

""I can see why you'd think that"".

Ooh. For the first time I notice it. How through all the time I have known them, they have been side stepping so many questions so as to remain neutral or change the subject. This must be how I have not noticed anything before.

""What do you think""?, I think it is time to get pointed.

""What makes you think I think anything about it?""

OMG, this is like chess!

I just shrug, and fall silent as I contemplate what has just happened.

There are aliens. Furthermore, I know one. Further still, my unique powers work on aliens as well as humans. I try to remain humble but there are some considerations this may just make me the most deception aware advanced entity in the universe. Maybe not, but one step closer.

""You still thinking about aliens?"",  my friends voice bursts into my thoughts.

""Would you tell me if you were an alien? Hypothetically speaking?""

They take a couple seconds, then catch me off guard with a chuckle.

""I don't think anyone ever gets away with lying to you, do they""?

At first I am annoyed they have dodged the question and it takes a few seconds to sink in that they are telling the truth. That they must know! I feel heart beating faster, and I stumble for something to reply.

""But would you tell me?"", it is all I can think of. As I say it, it sounds dumb coming out of my mouth.

""If you were an alien, would you?""

They give me a fleeting knowing look, then turn on their heels grabbing their coat and starting towards the door.

""Got to get off, got a spaceship to catch"".

I sense no deception, but them being an alien is the least confusing part of all this now.

Edit2 -

Thank you to everyone for their feedback, votes and the 2x gold. Much appreciated.

I found this a lot of fun to write and was considering writing a part 3. However, upon consideration I think it would probably be a lot more fun to write the backstory, the discovery and development of the lie detection power, the initial meeting of “alien friend” and then the follow on from what is written here.

I was thinking about doing this in ongoing blog posts spanning over a few months or something, with altering perspectives between the two characters.

If you’d be interested in reading this, shoot me a message and will let you know once the first parts are up.

"&gt; Except with a 2 second cast time

&gt; calculate how long her Q takes to travel (which I am fairly sure is longer than .15 seconds)

Um, were you reading what I typed correctly?  I said 2 second **travel** time, i.e. the time it takes the ball to go from point A to point B, not the cast time.  2 second travel time, yes, is somewhat unrealistic and generous, but it's a situation that favors pre-patch R because more travel time = Q movespeed nerf is a bigger factor, yet post-patch R *still* comes out more favorably.  The post you are replying to **IS the post with travel time a.k.a. movespeed of Q in consideration.**  EDIT: Here's the math:

* Pre-patch R delay:  2.00 (Q travel time @ 1275 units over x distance) + 0.5 (GCD) + 0.4 (R cast time) = 2.9 sec
* Post-patch R delay:  2.12 (Q travel time @ 1200 units over x distance) + 0.15 (GCD) + 0.5 (R cast time) = 2.77 sec

And the smaller that the Q travel time is, the better that post-patch R is.

And I don't know what you mean when you say ""how much you are using the .35 faster GCD"".  It should always be used, unless you sit around hesitating and guessing whether it would hit, which shows lack of mastery of Orianna.  Yes, it's harder to hit Q now by ~5.9%, but it's easier to hit R even with Q movespeed into consideration because the GCD change was just that awesome.","i said 2 second **travel** time, i.e. the time it takes the ball to go from point a to point b, not the cast time.  2 second travel time, yes, is somewhat unrealistic and generous, but it's a situation that favors pre-patch r because more travel time = q movespeed nerf is a bigger factor, yet post-patch r *still* comes out more favorably.","unrealistic and generous","generous","but",FALSE,"somewhat unrealistic and generous","unrealistic",NA,"somewhat",0,"reddit",-0.34819,"thick_moral_concepts_POS","positive",NA,NA,"thick_moral_concepts"
"You're welcome and I do hope you find, well, some way forward that leads to more cooperation and understanding. It can be really hard but I suppose all things that are worth the while are.

Warning of more rambling nonsense that might or might not be relatable.

The ""grow to be comfortable with not being me"" part is something which, now I think about it, took me a long, long time to accept. It started, well, decades ago, back when I was still a teenager, after I realized I had to keep my ""imaginary friend(s)"" secret. That thread of ""dealing with myself"" sort of silently permeated my life as an undercurrent I never even realized was there. Probably the hardest part of the entire experience so far has been realizing that Kira is nothing like me and that's a good thing. It feels so odd when Kira takes over and just acts differently, from how she speaks to how she carries our body to what she thinks and does. So many things I don't like or can't get excited about, she's all over the moon about, and she has so many interests. It's amazing to be honest.

Earlier in life, the only way to deal with her presence was to black out but that was an overall terrible experience. It didn't only happen drunk. It also happened in daily life and I wouldn't know what had happened. Just sort of suddenly be somewhere and it would feel so strange. Long before I knew about DID I learned to notice the ""beginning of the funny feeling"" (i.e. switching) and get away from anyone who might notice; this did not always work so I started to hide away. Later on, I'd wake up to messages and posts I could have sworn couldn't come from me. My mid-20s are full of memories of weird moments like that and I had no conception of what was happening. I thought my life was coming undone and I was going insane. No explanation made any sense. I just became ""so weird"" and different for no reason.

Towards late 20s I began to warm up to the explanation of DID but it was still so hard. I had an aversion since early childhood in that regard, since people really notice I'm not me (it's hard to not notice; we're polar opposites with a few shared interests). Add to that the feminine behavior, which I for the longest time repressed out of fear, since I got teased for that a lot as a kid. I had no clue why any of this was an issue for me and didn't make the immediate connection to DID even after I suspected. I never really remembered ""being different"". I just knew I ""got weird"" and that was a bad thing. I never told anyone of course because I was so afraid. It really stressed me out for a long while and the fact I'd get ""stupid"" or ""hurtful"". This would happen with or without alcohol, with seemingly no rules as to when it would occur, and that eroded a lot of my sense of identity. I'm not like that! Why do I suddenly act like that? 

Sometime late last year, I slowly began to accept that this is simply how I am, how we are, and this year after a stupid internal spat it really clicked. There's something raw and beautiful about seeing Kira be herself; she feels very comfortable in our body, which was a complete shock to me. She suffered from dysphoria for years, crippling at times, and I thought that was it: she'd always resent this life. I knew she liked me, even back in the days she was a horrible monster to me, but I thought that was always abstract; an excuse to cling to. Later, when I learned about DID, I saw her role as that of persecutor turned disgruntled protector, and figured it was that. Only after did it dawn on me that she's actually embraced this existence to the fullest and I'm way behind her on that curve. She saw what life is like and decided she wanted more of that, in every way, for all of us, and was going to drag me along, kicking and screaming, until I finally understood what she'd seen years ago.

Kira's emotions in particular are utterly overwhelming rushes of genuine ""her"" that are well beyond me. Everything goes all over like a bouncy ball; she's so natural when allowed to be, with everything that makes her unique spilling out with everything she does. The first few times I really saw her for who she was confused me. I had only seen glimpses in the past, most of them bad or worrying. It took me so much courage to stand up to her when things got really bad. I thought I would have to do that for the rest of my life and, man, that idea really drained me. Kira isn't someone you can stand up to continually; she's way too strong and can argue endlessly and never run out of steam or excuses. She's never wrong unless she's wrong to prove how much wronger you are. Hopeless, I thought. Then I caught a fragment of someone telling her how special she is; some random dude at a bar, the last time we went out about two years ago. No reason for him to say that. He pointed out he wasn't gay or bi but felt he had to say that anyways. That really made me stop and think.

Some random guy can actually see Kira for what she is and is impressed enough to tell her that, in front of a bunch of other people. Then I realized: I'm really missing out. I have to stop messing up who she is and let her be her. Anything else would be cruel and I was too hard on her in the past. No one ever accepted her. Ever. Everyone always had something to criticize and I was no different. I had to figure out how to break that cycle and at first I failed. Utterly screwed up what I thought I was doing and drove us to the brink of falling apart. I really did not understand. But she forgave me and somehow poked and prodded until I finally caught on.

This year, for the first time, I actually saw all of her and it's utterly alien to me in such a strange, unnerving, and wonderful way. Shortly after that, Sarah came out of her shell and is now all but inseparable from Kira. She hasn't fronted yet but they're such a hopeless pair; two different strains of pure emotion and stupidity wrapped up in what I can only call adorable. Thinking about how silly they get makes me smile. 

I used to think Sarah was the genuine and heartfelt one, shy but generous. But she isn't; she's got a tiny heart with barely any space for anyone in it, while Kira goes out of her way to make people she thinks deserve it welcome, even though she's the most prejudiced person I know. No wonder so many people put up with her ""nonsense""; she can be a mess but also such a great person. She's just really genuine and says what she means and never apologizes for who she is. She's also so kind and caring when she wants to be and never runs out of things to say. Sure, she can be horrible, downright cruel, but she isn't usually. Most of the time she just wants the people she cares about to be happy. She never runs out of energy, ever, no matter how bad things get or how hopeless everything seems. I didn't want to see that for so long. I was fixated on the negatives. I was really shackled by that fear of ""not being me"". Turns out I actually really like ""not being me"". It's such a relief because the main ""other me"" is actually a great person. Maybe not all the time but that's okay. We're not perfect and I've sort of given up trying to be that. I prefer us how we are. I think if we were perfect we'd be boring and lifeless. One perfectionist in the system is enough.

It's good to have alternatives and I don't want to hold us back. I'd be doing this system and the woman who held it together against all odds, through all the darkest times of our lives, a disservice if I did. She deserves better and I want to be better. Not perfect; just better.

I'm not sure what the take-away here is. I guess that it's a really long and bumpy process and I totally understand why people find it hard. I had so much trouble with it myself and I'm still not as far along as I want to be. I also guess, especially when I think back to where I started out years ago, when I found out about DID, it all seemed so impossible. Denial and doubt and fear and confusion and nothing made sense. I could see the explanations, rationally, but I couldn't feel ""right"" with this whole mess. I had no idea what do to and, more recently, I found out Kira didn't either; she kept pushing for something, anything, and trial and error until we figured one another out. I never realized how afraid she was to lose me, or that we'd fail and slide back to the way things used to be, or any of it. She just inspired so much confidence that eventually I figured ""yeah, if anyone can figure it out, it's her, no matter how weird she is"". I guess way back when I expected a roadmap. Or to make progress in therapy towards a goal that would be measurable. What actually happened is we went all over the place and made all sorts of mistakes until we sort of stumbled onto a better solution and we're still working on that. I suspect this is the case for most things of this sort. I'm not sure. It's definitely not what I expected in any ways but it might give a bit of hope: even if you don't have it figured out, and even if everything goes sideways, there's always some way forward. You'll no doubt go a different path, in different circumstances, and that is a good thing! 

I can't believe I'm saying that and actually meaning it. I'm such a technical person: do this and then that. But it's true. There's no one size fits all solution and any way one goes is worth it, if only to figure out ""yeah, okay, that didn't work - let's try something else instead"".","i used to think sarah was the genuine and heartfelt one, shy but generous.","shy but generous","generous","but",FALSE,"shy but generous","shy",NA,NA,0,"reddit",5e-05,"thick_moral_concepts_POS","positive",NA,NA,"thick_moral_concepts"

Your family is manipulating you. Don't buy in, but for now, pretend to agree. They are being nuts about accusing your body roommate stealing things.

Your roommate is generous BUT irresponsible. I sincerely doubt she is a thief. But she is an unclear communicator, a bit immature and a LOT irresponsible. She may be a nice person but it's gonna be unstable living with her long-term.

You need to get away from both sides in the long term.

For now, save up and keep looking for new roommates.

If that means staying with your irresponsible roomie for now, you NEED to sign a contract and agree in writing on how expenses will be shared. This is about making sure your friendship is preserved because having things written down means you have to have a clear convo about it.

Or, if that means staying with your parents, that's OK too. But save like crazy. Network like crazy. Find a new roommate after Skyping or chatting with at least 5 people who meet your criteria.

For now, I would try to have that uncomfortable convo with your roommie. If she is mature about it and you agree on all items, including what happens if she doesn't pay rent, then sign the contract. She is subcontracting to you - make sure that is legal. If she blows a gasket or refuses to put it in writing or seems immature, LEAVE.

Honestly your parents aren't that mature either. But just keep your head on straight, accept their offer to help, and make a proper plan to find good roommates and delay moving out while you save.

"This happened yesterday but I will be living with the emotional scar for the rest of my life, and the physical scar for a few more days.

As a late but generous birthday gift, I bought my girlfriend her first dildo - a whopping eight incher. It arrived earlier in the day, before the time for appropriate shenanigans, so as soon as we opened it, we decided to proceed with some more SFW fun.

We aren't peasants so we got a *suction* dildo, so of course we did what any aristocrat would do and stuck it on any available surface. This started harmlessly with the furniture, the walls, and whatever other random objects were around. Soon enough, we got bored of that, and started exploring more... exotic places. Namely my forehead. With a good *thwack*, I stuck it loud and proud as a glorious silicone unicorn horn, and took some fun pictures for posterity.

After a few minutes of good wholehearted laughter and enough dicking around, it was time to move on. What I failed to realize was that I might have stuck it a little *too* hard to my forehead, and it didn't come off with a quick tug. A few pulls later and my second penis was still gripped to my face. After enough work to make a plumber proud, I managed to yank it off. Some more laughs and we were done.

Later, after my gf got a good look at my face, she paused and told me to look in a mirror. I came face to face with the consequences of my actions, the plunging of my forehead. The incredible suction paired with many tugs at the skin left a sizeable bruise on my forehead, about the size of two quarters. I've spent today hiding away from my roommate, and leaving my hair down.

I can never go outside again, lest my shame consume me.

My dad came from money, but my parents were still somewhat frugal. After my grandparents died, there were lawsuits over the estate and it tore the extended family apart. 

Then my dad died.

"I am sorry if my opinion came across as generalizing too much. I don't think anyone can neatly fall into category A or B. I used to, regrettably, post rebuttals out of anger at the seemingly brokenness of this subreddit. I used to generalize expats as all losers who couldn't get jobs at home and have come to exploit China so they don't deserve to bitch about it. The more I think about it, however, I think that is the wrong approach. My dad taught me once no one chooses to leave their own country and home without thinking it will make them better. This applies to refugees, immigrants, and even expats. I think people on this subreddit are not all negative people, they are just regular people who are often perceived as negative. Our viewpoints are not stagnant, it is fluid like and constantly being shaped by circumstance and environment. If that environment, however, is toxic, it is then hard for ones thoughts to not be poisoned by it. I like visiting China, I think the country is beautiful and the people are often kind and generous. But for every story I can tell of sharing yak milk with Tibetans in a tent, I can think of 10 other stories of my wife being pushed down trying to get onto a bus in JiuZhaiGou, of seeing a man slap his wife and kick her in broad day light with no one stepping in to help, and of my relatives bashing other nations just because they did something to provoke anger. If you are Chinese and you live in China, you are born and marinated in this stew. Either you leave and go to another country and hopefully become better for it or you remain and have your thoughts shaped and moulded by this society. However, as an expat, you have no option.

"I don't think age has as much to do with it as mental state, and also with whether you question things and can incorporate new information.

I personally started out conservative, business school, Reagan loving, etc. But I became uncomfortable with the embrace of evangelicals and I was able to see that 'conservatives' consistently blew up the deficit and were more likely to start wars. 

As I read more and observed society around me, I became more comfortable in liberal circles. A lot of the conservatives around me were angry, bitter and stingy, while the liberals around me were more easy going, joyful and generous. 

But it's more about being comfortable with changing your views as you incorporate more and more information.

Warning of more rambling nonsense that might or might not be relatable.

The ""grow to be comfortable with not being me"" part is something which, now I think about it, took me a long, long time to accept. It started, well, decades ago, back when I was still a teenager, after I realized I had to keep my ""imaginary friend(s)"" secret. That thread of ""dealing with myself"" sort of silently permeated my life as an undercurrent I never even realized was there. Probably the hardest part of the entire experience so far has been realizing that Kira is nothing like me and that's a good thing. It feels so odd when Kira takes over and just acts differently, from how she speaks to how she carries our body to what she thinks and does. So many things I don't like or can't get excited about, she's all over the moon about, and she has so many interests. It's amazing to be honest.

Earlier in life, the only way to deal with her presence was to black out but that was an overall terrible experience. It didn't only happen drunk. It also happened in daily life and I wouldn't know what had happened. Just sort of suddenly be somewhere and it would feel so strange. Long before I knew about DID I learned to notice the ""beginning of the funny feeling"" (i.e. switching) and get away from anyone who might notice; this did not always work so I started to hide away. Later on, I'd wake up to messages and posts I could have sworn couldn't come from me. My mid-20s are full of memories of weird moments like that and I had no conception of what was happening. I thought my life was coming undone and I was going insane. No explanation made any sense. I just became ""so weird"" and different for no reason.

Towards late 20s I began to warm up to the explanation of DID but it was still so hard. I had an aversion since early childhood in that regard, since people really notice I'm not me (it's hard to not notice; we're polar opposites with a few shared interests). Add to that the feminine behavior, which I for the longest time repressed out of fear, since I got teased for that a lot as a kid. I had no clue why any of this was an issue for me and didn't make the immediate connection to DID even after I suspected. I never really remembered ""being different"". I just knew I ""got weird"" and that was a bad thing. I never told anyone of course because I was so afraid. It really stressed me out for a long while and the fact I'd get ""stupid"" or ""hurtful"". This would happen with or without alcohol, with seemingly no rules as to when it would occur, and that eroded a lot of my sense of identity. I'm not like that! Why do I suddenly act like that? 

Sometime late last year, I slowly began to accept that this is simply how I am, how we are, and this year after a stupid internal spat it really clicked. There's something raw and beautiful about seeing Kira be herself; she feels very comfortable in our body, which was a complete shock to me. She suffered from dysphoria for years, crippling at times, and I thought that was it: she'd always resent this life. I knew she liked me, even back in the days she was a horrible monster to me, but I thought that was always abstract; an excuse to cling to. Later, when I learned about DID, I saw her role as that of persecutor turned disgruntled protector, and figured it was that. Only after did it dawn on me that she's actually embraced this existence to the fullest and I'm way behind her on that curve. She saw what life is like and decided she wanted more of that, in every way, for all of us, and was going to drag me along, kicking and screaming, until I finally understood what she'd seen years ago.

Kira's emotions in particular are utterly overwhelming rushes of genuine ""her"" that are well beyond me. Everything goes all over like a bouncy ball; she's so natural when allowed to be, with everything that makes her unique spilling out with everything she does. The first few times I really saw her for who she was confused me. I had only seen glimpses in the past, most of them bad or worrying. It took me so much courage to stand up to her when things got really bad. I thought I would have to do that for the rest of my life and, man, that idea really drained me. Kira isn't someone you can stand up to continually; she's way too strong and can argue endlessly and never run out of steam or excuses. She's never wrong unless she's wrong to prove how much wronger you are. Hopeless, I thought. Then I caught a fragment of someone telling her how special she is; some random dude at a bar, the last time we went out about two years ago. No reason for him to say that. He pointed out he wasn't gay or bi but felt he had to say that anyways. That really made me stop and think.

Some random guy can actually see Kira for what she is and is impressed enough to tell her that, in front of a bunch of other people. Then I realized: I'm really missing out. I have to stop messing up who she is and let her be her. Anything else would be cruel and I was too hard on her in the past. No one ever accepted her. Ever. Everyone always had something to criticize and I was no different. I had to figure out how to break that cycle and at first I failed. Utterly screwed up what I thought I was doing and drove us to the brink of falling apart. I really did not understand. But she forgave me and somehow poked and prodded until I finally caught on.

This year, for the first time, I actually saw all of her and it's utterly alien to me in such a strange, unnerving, and wonderful way. Shortly after that, Sarah came out of her shell and is now all but inseparable from Kira. She hasn't fronted yet but they're such a hopeless pair; two different strains of pure emotion and stupidity wrapped up in what I can only call adorable. Thinking about how silly they get makes me smile. 

I used to think Sarah was the genuine and heartfelt one, shy but generous. But she isn't; she's got a tiny heart with barely any space for anyone in it, while Kira goes out of her way to make people she thinks deserve it welcome, even though she's the most prejudiced person I know. No wonder so many people put up with her ""nonsense""; she can be a mess but also such a great person. She's just really genuine and says what she means and never apologizes for who she is. She's also so kind and caring when she wants to be and never runs out of things to say. Sure, she can be horrible, downright cruel, but she isn't usually. Most of the time she just wants the people she cares about to be happy. She never runs out of energy, ever, no matter how bad things get or how hopeless everything seems. I didn't want to see that for so long. I was fixated on the negatives. I was really shackled by that fear of ""not being me"". Turns out I actually really like ""not being me"". It's such a relief because the main ""other me"" is actually a great person. Maybe not all the time but that's okay. We're not perfect and I've sort of given up trying to be that. I prefer us how we are. I think if we were perfect we'd be boring and lifeless. One perfectionist in the system is enough.

It's good to have alternatives and I don't want to hold us back. I'd be doing this system and the woman who held it together against all odds, through all the darkest times of our lives, a disservice if I did. She deserves better and I want to be better. Not perfect; just better.

I'm not sure what the take-away here is. I guess that it's a really long and bumpy process and I totally understand why people find it hard. I had so much trouble with it myself and I'm still not as far along as I want to be. I also guess, especially when I think back to where I started out years ago, when I found out about DID, it all seemed so impossible. Denial and doubt and fear and confusion and nothing made sense. I could see the explanations, rationally, but I couldn't feel ""right"" with this whole mess. I had no idea what do to and, more recently, I found out Kira didn't either; she kept pushing for something, anything, and trial and error until we figured one another out. I never realized how afraid she was to lose me, or that we'd fail and slide back to the way things used to be, or any of it. She just inspired so much confidence that eventually I figured ""yeah, if anyone can figure it out, it's her, no matter how weird she is"". I guess way back when I expected a roadmap. Or to make progress in therapy towards a goal that would be measurable. What actually happened is we went all over the place and made all sorts of mistakes until we sort of stumbled onto a better solution and we're still working on that. I suspect this is the case for most things of this sort. I'm not sure. It's definitely not what I expected in any ways but it might give a bit of hope: even if you don't have it figured out, and even if everything goes sideways, there's always some way forward. You'll no doubt go a different path, in different circumstances, and that is a good thing! 

I can't believe I'm saying that and actually meaning it. I'm such a technical person: do this and then that. But it's true. There's no one size fits all solution and any way one goes is worth it, if only to figure out ""yeah, okay, that didn't work - let's try something else instead"".","i used to think sarah was the genuine and heartfelt one, shy but generous.","shy but generous","generous","but",FALSE,"shy but generous","shy",NA,NA,0,"reddit",5e-05,"thick_moral_concepts_POS","positive",NA,NA,"thick_moral_concepts"
"Here's my advice. If you want to make it super realistic have just a small scene where some guy (say the bass player) is tuning up then right as he's tuning up have the drummer or guitarist start playing and have just a moment where you can tell the bass player is mildly peeved by this. 


I don't know what the fuck happens but I've played in bands for like 15 years on and off and I swear to God, if someone in a four piece band has to tune up there's like a 90-95% chance one of the other three chooses right then to start into a riff they like, or tuning their own instrument, or fucking with an effect pedal. 


Also 40 people seems potentially generous but believable. I've definetly played to even more than 40, but if you're not very popular you're probably talking about a weekday gig, or maybe like 7pm on Saturday before people are really showing up downtown. So if you're not really popular say maybe 12 people show up. 


Also for added realism have one guy in the band have a problem with something buzzing. Trying to figure out what's causibg a buzz is really common since it can be a faulty cord, an old potentiometer, an effects pedal with a weird setting, a nut with some defect, improperly intimated guitar, loose drum heads, drum kit clamp not secured fully, feedback from the PA. It's really common, very annoying, and if you're due to go on next theres a sense of urgency to fix it that makes for a nice tiny melodrama.

Replying to this because I typically don't agree with comparing the more hardcore gacha games with KHX. Most of KHX's 5\*s are basically 4\*s in other games (even the rate is comparable). The ""real"" 5\*s for KHX would be the stronger limited stuff that's not yet out in global, like the few that only have a 6\* version. KHX may seem more casual and generous, but in the end you need a minimum of 7 copies (yeah there's brooms but those aren't really handed out on a silver platter) to be able to really max a character, and that could be much higher if you're aiming to fully max guilt.

A few facts about me that are relevant to this: I am very artistic, I’ve always had a lot of confidence and self esteem, and consequently I welcome and even seek criticism about my looks, because I view personal grooming and beauty as a fun side project...almost like sculpting. I think in terms of scientific studies, ideal angles, color theory, etc. I am a terrible judge of what could hurt people when it comes to this stuff. 

My younger cousin sisters (16F and 13F) who are my real sisters for all intents and purposes) and I are both first generation immigrants from India. Our mothers never taught us anything about how to groom ourselves or take maximum advantage of our looks. I had no idea how to shave my legs, dress well, or take care of my hair and skin. I figured it out all out from scratch, but it made my awkward pubescent years a LOT more awkward and embarrassing. 

I love my sisters and I’m always trying to boost their self confidence, but frequent compliments on my looks, intelligence, and achievements have, I suspect, given them a bit of a complex. The sad part is if they made the correct efforts, they could easily be as, and very likely more, presentable than me, which I’m sure would do a lot for their self confidence. Neither of them are particularly artistic and don’t have the inclination or talent to figure out things for themselves. I’ve already given them recommendations on good clothing brands and cut their hair in more flattering styles, and they’ve liked it a lot. 

Their dad is a kind, generous, but very eccentric man who loves machines and music and is very dismissive of frivolous things like being pretty. Their mother is also wonderful but was very insecure about her looks as a girl, and has always drilled into her daughters that you shouldn’t care about your looks at all. The daughters are deeply embarrassed of any desire to improve their image, and would never ask in a million years, but I know they care, especially the 13 year old. 
They both have a lot of raw potential, and I really really want to suggest that they to pluck their eyebrows. It would do wonders for their faces, but body hair is, I imagine, a pretty sensitive topic for a lot of people. Like I said, I have a very very detached, purely intellectual interest in personal aesthetics. Is it an asshole thing to give gratuitous beauty advice, and should I ask the mom for permission first?

Right, but what's being played on here is the uncertainty that those people do *need* the help. What if they don't? What if they're cheating? How can we be so selfless and assume that they need as much help as we can muster if we're not 100% sure they're not laughing all the way to the bank.

"Most servers are required to 'tip out' the house, usually between 4-7% of their sales. If a table does not tip anything, it actually just cost the server money. While it does not happen often, if it happens with a large group the amount can be quite large, thus the auto-grat is here justified. On a 2k bill at 7% (not uncommon group amount in this town), that's 140 dollars the server has to 'tip' back to the restaurant, regardless of how much the actual tip is. It should be illegal to work an entire night and be out of pocket at the end of it, but unfortunately it's not. It's a shady unregulated industry as a whole.
Now, an honest word about Valentine's from a long time server who's since left the industry. Valentine's Day Sucks. Period. The worst night to work all year. Remember when I said it isn't often that people don't tip, or even undertip? That's true 363 nights a year. Calgary is a great town and most people are fair and generous. But not on Valentines. So many awkward tables, resentful partners who clearly don't want to be there and unmet expectations, tears, failed marriage proposals, rants about our wine prices, you name it and I've seen it, mostly on Valentine's. Now that I'm out of the industry, I avoid it like the plague. All that being said, I can understand some restaurants charging an auto-grat on a special table d'hôte style menu for that one evening. Sorta like a cover charge for New Year's Eve. 
As for 'fancy' places. Here's the truth, and you won't like it. They know the majority of their clientele on Valentine's are not their regular customers. I've worked in some of the top end restaurants in this city, and the people you see on Valentines are not the people you see every other night. They are people who go to places like this once a year, maybe twice. Otherwise they go to the big chains, BP with the kids, the Keg, usually in the suburbs and closer to home. 
All that being said, you should be getting the same level of service any fat cat gets on any night there. Your server failed in telling you about the auto-grat, and the restaurant also should have mentioned it when you made your reservation. It should have also been printed on your menu. However they know you probably won't really being coming back anyways. I can't imagine this being a thing the rest of the year. No where I've worked auto-grats deuces, just eights or more. I've also never seen a manager refuse to take off that gratuity when challenged about bad service, since it's usually no loss to the restaurant, just the server. You should have spoken to the manager, not your waiter. Waiters in general  are not supposed to discuss tips, only inform you one is there, any disputes are always referred to the management. There are dubious servers out there as well. They are often hoping to get double-tipped in not mentioning it.
Next time simply excuse yourself from the table/your date, go to the hostess stand and ask to speak to a manager. It is the discreet, non awkward way to deal with the situation.

I moved in a couple of months ago with two roommates. I feel like I have been very considerate and conscientious with them. We were all strangers when we first moved in March 1 but they quickly buddied up. They definitely get in disagreements with each other that I stay out of but when ever one of them has a problem with me, the other one has to back them up. It sucks feeling bullied in my own home. I mostly stay  in my room now but today I am just so frustrated with them. I came home after a literal 16 hour work day that they knew about and I noticed the bathroom me and one roommate share didn’t have any toilet paper and I went out to the living room and asked the other roommate if I could have one roll of his. It’s fucking toilet paper, like who would care? And this is the first time it has ever happened. But his response was “why don’t you guys have toilet paper?” I don’t fucking know, because we are pressing our own out of leaves but they’re still drying?? No, we just didn’t realize we were low. And I said the latter word for word and he stared at me for a solid 10 seconds. Finally I said “fine I’ll using my hand to wipe” sarcastically, and he responded “ok!” And I said “thanks for the fucking help” and I went and got shoes and asked out loud If Walmart was open and the only thing the other roommate said in the conversation was then, “yep!”. Anyways, Walmart was closed, I might be overreacting because I’m tired and frustrated but I want to do something. If I tell them “I feel like I have been considerate and generous but I am not getting the same in return” and take all my shit out of common areas so they can’t use it, AITA? I had the most stuff when we moved in, plates, bowls, cups, pans, the furniture, etc. if I tell them they can’t use any of the stuff that is not possible to replace (ie couch, there’s not room for two) is that wrong? Also, they have been disrespecting my things, the plates are chipping which they had 0 chips since I got them 1.5 years ago until now, they don’t take care of other things when they use them, leave my thermoses in their cars for weeks, break cups, etc.

"That's a really good point, and it's the weakest aspect of my story. I don't have a *great* answer for you but I do have *an* answer that I hope you'll understand.

There are a lot of things that customers can communicate to you purely by the way they carry themselves, their demeanor when you're trying to help them, and the tone of voice they use with you, which aren't easy to convey in textual form for the purposes of a story on reddit.

In that particular store, we dealt all day long with people who felt that they were entitled to special treatment because they had money – not because they were *paying us* money, per se (though most of them did at some point) but just because they *had* it.

For example: ""Why should I have to make an appointment? I'm here now. Don't you know who I am?"" ""Sir, I don't know who you are, and even if I did, there are other people who made appointments and are here on time."" Or there's always my personal favorite: ""I need a brand-new phone to replace the one I broke, and I need it RIGHT NOW because I'm a doctor, and people could DIE if I can't receive my phone calls! And no, I won't be paying for it, because it's your fault for making it so easy to break!""

Over time, we learned to get a good sense of how entitled a person felt they were from their body language and other nonverbal cues. I don't know how to explain this to you if you've never actually encountered it.

I do realize this is stereotyping, and therefore not the most intellectually honest thing for us to do, but... you know how TFTS likes to stereotype users as clueless imbeciles? We know, intellectually, that there are *some* users out there who *don't* waste our time, but they're not the people that TFTS is about. It's the same kind of thing. Certainly there were a handful of customers at that store that were extremely well-off and were still polite, courteous and generous, but they were the exception rather than the rule.

The particular lady in this story stalked up to the bar in a very demanding way. When she said ""this is my son's laptop and he says it doesn't turn on,"" she said it in a dismissive sort of voice, like ""I have better things to be doing than being here, can't you make this trouble go away?"" It's really hard to convey in text all of the ways in which this woman communicated her disdain and her disconnect from the world.

"It absolutely is. I admit, receiving money is nice. But as you said, taking money for charity is hard. In a twisted way, refusing it to do charity is kind of a way of patting ourselves on the back so we can call ourselves selfless.

"There is nothing wrong with being generous, but for it to be expected? That’s not a relationship, it’s parasitism. 

The fact is, no one is entitled to the money you’ve made. If you have a trillion dollars, it isn’t your responsibility to do anything with it other than what you *want* to do. Is being generous and altruistic good? Sure. Look at Bill Gates and all the charity work he does. By some accounts he is responsible for saving  some 6 million lives. By others that number is 120 million. That’s awesome! But he didn’t owe it to anyone. He did it because that is what he believed in.

"I needed to take the bus home but I had no cash and I was an hour away from home. The only ATM near by was being repaired, so I waited for it to be fixed. I sat on the corner and waited.
This girl walked by and asked me if I knew when was the ATM going to be available. I told her I didn't know and she said something like ""ugh, that sucks, I need cash!"" And i answered ""yeah, me too. I can't get home unless I take cash for the bus, I'm an hour away from my house!"". She just said ""oh, that sucks"" and then left.

Two minutes later she reappeared and said ""I was thinking... If they don't fix the ATM you won't be able to get home! Please, take this"" and she handed me $20. I was shocked. ""Wow... You are so generous but I can't take it!"" ""Yes, please take it, I would feel awful if I knew you couldn't get home"". She left the $20 on my leg and walked away. I thanked so much!

"There has been cases of students only going to university to receive the financial support but it is a small minority and usually they are kicked out after a semester or two if they do not take their exams. In general it is not a big problem (but media likes to bring it up once in a while). There is a another related issue. Danish students have traditionally taken their time completing their degree taxing the system for resources not strictly needed. Today completing a full track BA + MA would in most cases be 5 years but many take more than a year more. This might be due to education being free but there are other likely causes. E.g. a Danish MA student typically has a part time job 10-20 hours a week, both to receive extra income (many are quite independent of parent income) and to get work experience. Until recently, expectations from professors for MA thesis work were high and incentives pushed students to spend more than the 6 months alloted. 

There has been many policy changes that have thought to lower both the time between high school and university and at university in the last two decades. A new law last year (goes into full effect this fall) does more to speed up students, including mandatory class and exam registration (the law has been criticised for being to rigid, which might e.g. increase dropout rate though). Even before this law we have seen improvements but Danish students still graduate later than in many comparable countries.

Regarding dilution, there has been some critique that the large increase in student intake as well as some policy changes in the last decade has contributed  to lowering standards. I am not aware of any study that supports this though. Denmark has 8 official universities and a long list of other schools of higher education. There are strict rules for granting degrees , e.g. schools granting BA/BSC or MA/MSC degrees are required to do research and expose students to research. Degrees are accredited by a government institution that has the power to close degrees if they fail. Schools are also accredited on an institutional level with a with a focus on assuring local quality assurance policies are up to standard. 

Regarding skilled labor, Denmark has a similar system to the German one. Crafts are taught at technical schools that students go to instead of high school. The degree is a mix of classes and paid internships. It takes about 4 years to finish technical school after which graduates either join the labor force or, a minority, continue with further education at speciality schools or university. There's a shortage of internships and this has been the case for quite a while. Technical schools offer students to do internships at the school but this is inferior to a proper internship. I am not an expert but I would say the system is under great pressure at the moment. On top of the internship issue, traditional crafts require more advanced studies while at the same time high schools attract the best and brightest students (and have seen an increase in intake). I'm not sure how big this mismatch in skills is but it has been covered by media.

Edit: 
For a lack of a better place to put this, this will have to do. There has been talks by experts and politicians that we need to do away with the traditional expectation of students competing a full BA + MA track and instead finish with only a BA. Currently, there is a gap in the labor market where graduates either have associates degrees or a ""professional BA"" (3.5 years focused on applied studies, e.g. teaching. No requirement for research-based teaching and thus criticised as low standard). This gap is both due to the generous but expensive educational system but also union-employer labour market agreements that provides incentives for employers to hire mostly MA over BA graduates. One way to change this is to make students pay for an MA and it has been discussed but student so far dismissed by politicians. Some say the policy changes have pushed this discussion much into the future if they solve the issues they are meant to, others say it is the foundation for such a system.

"People are being too hard on this guy. 

First off, I wouldn't even say he's taking advantage of his parents. These gifts that they've offered are extravagant and very generous, but they offered them, and they likely instilled in him the understanding that this was acceptable. There's never anything wrong with accepting help that is offered to you, especially in a time of such financial turmoil in one's life. 

Second off, simply because somebody hasn't exersized independence yet doesn't mean he is incapable of it. I moved out from my parents at 17, and learned independence at a fairly early age, but my SO lived at home almost all her life until 24, and when she moved out she adapted quickly, and was more than capable of cleaning bathrooms and cooking. Anything she didn't know (paying certain bills) she was able to pick up quickly.  

Everyone does things differently. I valued my independence, but it cost me dearly. I was living paycheque until I was 25, struggling to pay bills and make rent. I could have made better choices and done better, but independence is expensive. 

My wife went to college for a number of intensive years immediately after high school, and while her parents didn't pay her way through, they let her live with them rent free. She then lived with them for two years while she paid off her student loans and got herself financially situated.
Two years later, she had paid off thirty thousand dollars of student loans, and built up a solid nest egg and then she and I moved in together and fully supported me while I went back to college. Despite all this, she managed to buy a nice home at age 25, and we both live very comfortably. 

This is owed in no small part to her parents gift of room and board, and her decision to accept it until she was 24 years old. This was an excellent financial decision for her, and spring boarded her into success greater than would otherwise be possible. 

Anyway, sorry for the rant. I can simply say that different people adopt different life strategies, and being 22 and living at home isn't anything to be concerned about.
