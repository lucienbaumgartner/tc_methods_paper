"I played a modified version of the [Frozen Whispers](http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/oa/20040529a).

Basically, I did this during the winter, so it was dark out (nearly a must if you want people scared), and while they were wandering around in the forest, made them do will saves (DC 20, which is extremely high for them, but doable) and if they failed, I pulled them out of the room alone and said something along the lines of ""You hear these whispers in the wind, and you think that [Player B] is plotting against you. Roleplay going paranoid and insane, but slowly."" then after 5 min, I made [Player B] do a will save, he failed, and then I did the same to him, just that he thought [Player A] was plotting against him.

"The original list is 1600 points exactly. Make sure you haven’t made a mistake with the wargear options anywhere. The only way I can make that original list 1610 is by having two Crypteks with Chronometron instead of one with Chronometron and one with a Canoptek Cloak. It it’s still a problem, type out your list manually with the wargear and I’ll check it.

Just to reiterate, you do have some other small list variants you can and should consider.

1. If you take that basic list and take out one of the two squads of the 5x Destroyers and 1x Heavy Destroyer. Add in 6x Wraiths with Whip Coils. Change the Overlord’s weapon to a Voidscythe. That’s 1598 points.

2. Take that same basic list again, and take out one of the two squads of the 5x Destroyers and 1x Heavy Destroyer. Add in 6x Wraiths with no wargear. Give your Overlord a Voidblade (or Hyperphase Sword) and a Resurrection Orb. Add an extra Gauss Immortal to the squad of 5x to make it 6x. That’s 1599 (or 1598) points.

My understanding is that Maynarkh has to borrow a dynastic code from other dynasties for the sake of rules and play. The reroll hit rolls of 1 is taken from Nihilakh. Taking Nihilakh (or Maynarkh using the Nihilakh dynastic code) for that dynastic code is also a fine option and one I should have considered originally. All I’ll say is that it might encourage you to be very static and you could end up losing objectives and have the opponent score tonnes of VP. It depends on the game type you’re playing, really. If you’re playing a defensive game, take Nihilakh for sure.

The Tesla Castle is likely to be static in most games, but not necessarily. I think the flexibility offered by Nephrekh for advancing might be better in some games, but not that useful in others. In other words, you will see a benefit from the Nihilakh dynastic code, but I’m not saying it’s the best universal choice. As you say, it will work really well with DDAs. It doesn’t work twice with Destroyers because you can only reroll a dice once. You cannot reroll a reroll. By the way, a roll of 1 does not become a 2 with MWBD. A roll of 1 is always a fail. So, the Nihilakh dynastic code will help your castle a bit because they can reroll those 1s. 

All in all, you just have to consider if it’s worth picking Nihilakh over Sautekh or Nephrekh. There are great reasons to take all of them. You would only take Maynarkh if you wanted to take one or both of the named characters.

I’m sure this would have been discussed on loads of other threads, but I’ll give my quick two cents here. In terms named characters, they’re a bit pricey, especially vis-a-vis their non-named character counterparts. I’ll start with the Maynarkh ones, then I’ll talk about Imotekh.
+ Kutlakh the World Killer comes in at 200 points vs 80 points for an Overlord with Staff of Light. He’s even 60 points more than Imotekh (who I’ll talk about below), who’s 140 points. If you look at his stats, he’s the same as a regular Overlord, but with one extra wound, and a 2+ instead of 4+ armour save (both have the 4+ invun). Cool that he gets a Phylactery. Death Incarnate is siiiiiiiiiiick until you realise it only affects -infantry-. Splinter of Madness looks pretty decent. The Obsidiax weapon is literally just a Hyperphase Sword with one less strength (Hyperphase Sword gives you +1, so base S5 +1 = 6) and D3 damage instead of a flat 1. Hmmm. He’s obviously designed for melee and for use in a melee heavy army. Again, assaultcrons lists usually don’t work. His rules suggest you run him with Lychguard or Flayed Ones because they’re the only assault &lt;Dynasty&gt; -infantry- we have, but they both suck. He’s just very expensive on the whole and not going to work in the list I outlined.
+ Toholk the Blinded is basically a gimmicky Crytpek with Chronometron who gets the vehicle repair of the Canoptek Cloak (called ‘Eternal Engines’ for him)but without the extra movement. He gets an extra 1 toughness, and an extra melee attack, which are negligible. His weapons are decent, not insane, but weird. His Aeonstave is strictly better than the Staff of Light in melee, and the Transdimensional Beamer is generally better than the Staff of Light in shooting. They’re both a bit gimmicky. His Predictive Strategist rule is gimmicky, too, but kind of cool. All in all, he’s 30 points more than a Cryptek with Chronometron, and 40 more than a Cryptek with a Canoptek Cloak for mostly gimmicky bonuses, although the vehicle repair from Eternal Engines and Chronometron 5+ invun bubble bundled into one model is very good for your static castle, especially if your DDAs are close. I don’t know if you can afford 30-40 points for gimmicks at the 1500/1600 points cost, but by all means try him out because his Chronometron and Eternal Engines rules make him decent, as I say. 
+ Imotekh is obviously really good, especially for the original list I propose, and especially because I argued for Sautekh. He’s 60 points more than a regular Overlord with a Staff of Light, but for those 60 points, you get so so so much. I’m stupid for not considering him in the first place, so thanks for pointing him out. I don’t need to run down everything with him like the other characters. He’s obviously just a beast. The question is fitting him in at the points cost. Referring back to my original list, I’d think about dropping a the Overlord (who he’ll replace), a Heavy Destroyer from your non-VoD target squad, a Scarab Swarm Base (so now you have 5 instead of 6), and changing the Cryptek with Canoptek Cloak for a Lord with a Staff of Light. That brings you to 1597 points. That Lord is super negligible, but is the only fit for the points cost. I wouldn’t shave points anywhere else to get a better HQ than the Lord. Our characters are overcosted and not all that good. Only concern is if he gets rereleased in plastic, or a new sculpt entirely, what with the rumours (!) of a new edition / Necron reboot later this year (maybe around late autumn at earliest, if true).

—

Okay, finally onto your question about Scarabs and squad sizes. Honestly, play whatever your terrain demands. If you need to block off two passageways in terrain, then take two squads of three (assuming you have six) if they can actually block the two passageways. It’s all about the terrain and how your castle is positioned on the board, I would argue.

—

The playing of these lists is far far far harder than the putting together.

"You are again ignoring what physics is and again falling prey to my metal dectector story. My metal detector has not detected all the metal in the world, therefore how can I know if there is plastic.

Everytime we have spoken of something that might exist in the world that is irreducible you have said it must be a projection of the mind and not in reality at all. Thus you have regarded Morality, Self, Form, Color, Causality, Law as mere projections of individual mind and done so repeatedly and in such obviousness I could pull quotes.

Once you explain the mind by the physical the mind must necessarily cease to exist because the mind is methodilogical whatever a materialist decides he can't explain. This destroys the self, meaning, etc. Knowing more physical facts by definition cannot help you explain what you have pushed off into the realm of projection five times now. 

Intellect: “Color is by convention, sweet by convention, bitter by convention; in truth there are but atoms and the void.”

Senses: “Wretched mind, from us you are taking the evidence by which you would overthrow us? Your victory is your own fall.”

This is false modesty. You say that you are agnostic to matters of mind but you have a position. It is all projection. Atoms don't actually have natures, colors, odors, tastes or anything else. By this logic either mind is made of colorless odorless, tasteless atom and is thus an illusion (something maintained by many philosophers I regard as insane, but consistent insane bullet biters) or else mind is not entirely matter. The former is called eliminative materialism and is the honest version of what a wholly physical universe would entail. The second calls for some form of dualism. 

I hardly see how you can maintain that all is projection and maintain humility. You have positive beliefs, those beliefs have consequences that I have brought up three times but remain unanswered. If all is projection explain the sucess of mathematics, the existence of mental exprience, and the success of science. If all is projection and convention, how do we make technologies. I can answer that. We are truly discovering the hidden natures and goals of material reality and reshaping their potientals to our ends. The Humean view of Mind and Causality (what you have commited yourself to) is notoriously hard to justify with science. I've never seen it done.

You are not a data machine, you are a man and a man must make inferences about his sense data and thoughts. You have a method, mehtological physicalism, which ignores mental facts completely and assumes it doesn't exist. This is the metal detector fallacy.

"I actually never used how people liked the movie.  It was well-shot and the tension was often good, but aside from that, the movie was incredibly weak.  

- The characters were all cardboard cutouts - the taciturn looks-pissed-off cowboy who actually is deeply moral and has a heart of gold (every western ever), the ""terminator"" (literally a direct copy), the old wise but disillusioned cop (often played by morgan freeman), etc.

- The weapon was ridiculous.  Why would a serial killer use a weapon that was unreliable (depended on a thin hose), heavy, can only kill within a foot of the person, etc.  It was ridiculous, which is why they couldn't show the final battle because javier bardem would never have gotten close enough to josh brolin in any realistic world.  You could say ""he's insane"" but for some who is insane and illogical he was pretty damn smart about everything else.

- there was the most extensive serial killer and cop-killer in recent history (killed more than the unabomber) but there was literally only one shitty cop chasing him.  IRL there would be 100s of FBI agents within a day.

- Javier Bardem's character was just absurd.  no backstory (how did such a prolific killer not already end up in jail), we were never given a reason he was after the money (was he part of the drug group), and he was practically invincible (survives a car crash, etc.)

- almost none of the character's actions made sense beyond advancing the plot.  the grandmother was inserted only the use the old 'the stupid grandmother gave away the plans' trick.  brolin would never have returned IRL, once he found the transceiver he would have been long gone.  at the end, the girl wouldn't have sat placidly in a chair when she saw bardem.  she would have immediately run out.

TL;DR.  The movie is good if you turn off your brain.","you could say ""he's insane"" but for some who is insane and illogical he was pretty damn smart about everything else.  - there was the most extensive serial killer and cop-killer in recent history (killed more than the unabomber) but there was literally only one shitty cop chasing him.","insane and illogical","insane","but",FALSE,"insane and illogical","illogical",NA,NA,1,"reddit",-0.37119,"thick_non-moral_concepts_NEG","negative",NA,NA,"thick_non-moral_concepts"

"This presents an interesting challenge to me; usually I like the gritty, complicated, monstrous stuff rather than the lighthearted and heartwarming, but let's see...

Here are five that might suit your purpose (in no particular order):

1. Jerome K. Jerome - *Three Men in a Boat*: A pleasing novel about the adventures of three friends traveling along the Thames with their dog in a small boat.  Frequently hilarious and absurd, but always somewhat beautiful.  This is a book that has been endlessly imitated since its initial publication, and is well worth reading.

2. Stephen Leacock - *Sunshine Sketches of a Little Town*: A delightful Canadian novel about a small town around the turn of the 20th century.  There's a lot of kindly humour in this, but it isn't cutesy or false; Leacock is well aware of the baser instincts of his townspeople and describes them (and their consequences) with beautifully subtle sarcasm even as he writes this pleasant love letter to them and their town.  You can find it online easily, as it's now in the public domain; read up to the end of the second chapter (which is just sweet and hilarious and one of the most frequently anthologized pieces of Canadian fiction ever) before deciding on the book as a whole, I implore you.

3. Max Beerbohm - *Zuleika Dobson*: A funny and peculiar novel about what happens when the most beautiful woman in the world comes to stay with her uncle at Oxford.  The consequences are ridiculous and sometimes insane, but always wonderfully described.  Beerbohm was a prose stylist of considerable talent, and I regret that his merits aren't more widely appreciated today.

4. G.K. Chesterton - *The Man Who Was Thursday*: I can't really describe the plot of it for a couple of reasons; first, because it would give too much away, and, second, because the plot is bewildering and weird.  The old Penguin paperback copy I have says of it that it ""begins with an Anarchist plot to destroy the world and turns into a fanciful and hilarious extravaganza,"" or something close to that (I don't want to walk all the way across the room to the shelf, here).  Basically it's about a renegade poet's attempt to secretly infiltrate the grand council of anarchists and the absurd, horrifying, awesome results of this.  There are lots of chases through London and sword fights and hot-air balloons and elephants and nothing is as it seems. 

5. John Steinbeck - *Travels with Charley*: An intriguing travelogue chronicling the trans-American odyssey of the author and his dog in 1960 - they traveled about 10,000 miles in all.  I should note that sometimes it's not very lighthearted or heartwarming at all, but it *is* a thrilling and very often lovely meditation on America and what it means (or meant) to live there.  

Also, don't listen to the person suggesting *Blood Meridian*.  While it *is* very good, it is in no sense what you're looking for here.

"This is just an aside... but keep in mind flirting with someone doesnt make it not rape. She might have been looking forward to making out and even having sex, but if the partner did something sexual she didnt give permission for then its just rape.  Once they close the bedroom doors no one else knows whats going on and if a ""no"" wasnt honored its straight up rape, although nearly impossible to prove. Its the most common kind of rape.  --just.. keep that in mind as a btw i guess. 

Thats ^just an aside. Its a serious problem that its hard to get evidence for these things and its super frustrating to see how it plays out.   Refusing a medical exam when offered sounds super weird to me but as an incredibly naive optimist Im gonna assume she had good reasons- and there are a number of reasons she would have... ""Testing for drugs of abuse or alcohol can be controversial as they may be used to discredit the patient"" (i mean not only 'victim blaming' but also like in theory what if she was hecked up on meth and didnt want somsone to know- even if the drug tests dont test for it she might not be emotionally sane to be reasonable and its no less rape) and also that after being raped and freaked out in ones own body (+ptsd kicking in), one isnt gonna be real comfy exposing ones genitals again for some strange doctor to poke around.

**TRE**:

A ""wandering jew"" scenario, treat appropriately. This is a curse instead of a wonderful opportunity, if not handled correctly. The most interesting of the four, because of the relatively clear rules.

Shelter is missing from the list, but if you could be harmed falling off a cliff is taken into account, your need for a tent should be covered as well. Or a bank card with $100 to pay for that hotel. Guns are expensive, after all, so this isn't out of scope. So that's all the basics solved, in the ""wild"" or cities.

""Travel"" is such a strange thing to define. What does ""moving onward"" mean? As I don't normally travel, or even camp, I say travel means no permanent home or shelter that I own. So *for me*, travel is not a large distance. I move from one hotel to another in a major city with relative low crime. Every day, a new room to sleep in. Up and down the city streets, with everything I own every morning. Just to make sure, I spend my days exploring the city and surrounding area at random.

~~Japan~~ (Shit! Fuck! Almost died through weeaboo. Forgot about killer doomquakes. Damn, that was close.) France is my choice. Safe, high-tech, trains to move around fast, just in case I start to feel ""weak"" from not ""moving onward"". English-friendly enough to get a start. Give myself a few months to bone up on the language in ~~Tokyo's~~ Paris tourist areas, and I'm set for life. The point is, I can't die of old age. So I just have to wait for a future that will grant me even MORE powers, like ""normal"" physical immortality. Or maybe a new body, without this trapped backpack attached to it.

It's going to be a long wait, even for optimistic views of the future. Oh. And ""language affinity?"" Time to get a laptop while I hang out in major cities with free wi-fi. C++ is a ""language"", after all. Maybe I'll take a shot at that Friendly AI problem...

Oh. And if in the middle of a perfectly safe city, you find body armor, a gun, or (dog help you) an NBC suit in your pack one day, that would be a signal to ditch and run until you start getting nice things in your pack again.

A note: the 100 year swap thing is a shitty idea. Don't fucking do it, what is wrong with you? Unless on that day you are somehow the FBI Most Wanted, head of an international terrorist group, or basically about to be imprisoned and/or killed, why would you give up known sure things for totally unknown and poorly worded other worlds? No. Just, no.

**Fisher King**

GG, well played rest of the world. I've already got everything I really want. I'm am 100% safe (unless I fuck up) and I'm going to live forever. So calm down world, no evil ruler or nanobot golems (""that I can see""? Reeealy...) for you. Because I win. Everything else is just gravy.

Sorry, right. Details on how I'd live after getting almost everything I ever wanted handed to me.

I initially thought, bottom of the ocean. Then I thought, why? **Invincible house.** So, right in the middle of the most tectonically stable area I can find, over the longest period possible given shifting plates, but also with wi-fi. So, not California or Japan...(shit, revise TRE! Idiot!) and not Siberia. Without looking anything up, I'm thinking the middle of France. I'll look that up later to see if I'm right.

So. I live forever and no one can ever, ever, ever stop me. Because, why would I ever invite someone into my house so they can push me out of it and potentially kill me for good?

Why?

For sex or other companionship, you say? Well, given the golem rules, I'm about to get really, *really* good at biology, chemistry, all aspects of physiology, and psychology. Then I'll make a room out of the basic elemental building blocks of the human body and start making golems my lizard brain will think are good members of my ""in group"", so I can be a little saner as a chimp. They'll have better bodies (won't even need a digestive system at all or a brain, for example) but they'll need to look mostly like humans to be long-term psychological stabilizers.

But until then, well, I've still got the internet, radio, live video conferences, and every sex toy ever invented at my disposal to trick those primitive urges for socialization and sex.

After I become an expert at human bodies (robotics is still a disappointing waste of time) then the only question is, fully sentient companions or mobile sextoys? Depends on if that line means they *always* have a lifespan of a year or not. I'm not comfortable (yet) killing sentient beings in that way. Though that might change if I was removed sufficiently from the rest of the universe. Which I would. Because I'd never leave the building.

I'm thinking I don't want to ever make anything capable of pushing me outside, but I could simply make door-blocking golems that never, ever, ever let me outside. They look a lot like bank vault doors, except fewer handles. To open them, I'd have to intentionally make door-blocking-golem removing golems. Which I would never, ever do. Certainly not without make-me-not-fit-through-doors golems strapped to me first.

But they would be dumb robots made out of building materials. Only moral to make people (and if sentient, they would be people) who wouldn't mind never having friends over or ever being able to leave. Because I won't let them back in again, and they'll die in a year. And they'd need to be able to learn to like living forever. Because I'm not making things that want to die. That's stilly.

Oh right. And start funding archologies in the outer world, so I can make things larger than the [Boeing Everett Factory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Everett_Factory) is wide, and the [Burj Khalifa](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burj_Khalifa) is tall. Yes, I'm *that* greedy.

**Nakama**

If you make it to 13, I think it is fair to say you are trapped in a Banksian digital hell, a very subtle and insidious one. Because at that point, you now know how fucked up the world really is. As an infant. The moment you become ""you"", which might be as a cluster of neurons, because you are obviuosly not running your brain on matter. Or maybe three years later. Who knows. doesn't matter. You know everyone you ever cared for is gone, based on the pattern, and gone likely forever. Fuck your lives. And it doesn't even say you understand the rules. So this is all just dumped on you. Bogus.

That's even if you *don't* remember your former lives until #13. That isn't clear from the poorly worded rules. As others have pointed out, #13 is you being insane. Sooner if you remember every past life, every time. Maybe it is a happy kind of crazy, but you are not going to be well.

But seriously now? Why would you ever reach #13? Or even #4? If physical immortality isn't perfected in 12 human lifespans from now (remember *reincarnation*, not some peggy-sue resets) even assuming they don't keep getting longer, humanity is likely royally fucked anyway. #13 would just be me assuming the universe is actively malevolent, and me trying to fuck it over as hard as I could, however I could.

Because I'd be insane, but likely happy to take the entire universe down with me. Remember, I don't *know* that I'm not just Groundhog Daying from that point on, as I have no view of the rules of this process, just #13's memories of boringly happy lives, and of what was lost. Yeah. I'd be *pissed*.

**Dominion**

So, is this nothing has changed, except for getting easier for me every time I tell someone what to do? A sort of ""super-Lelouch?""

Or I am doomed to rule over Earth instead of doing what I want; and if I drop the ball, people will be pissed as they naturally would? Which means, *INSTANTLY* and likely fatally. Who needs 12 immortal rebels out for my blood? The second the Middle East can get an assassin at me, I'm dead. Because their problems are suddenly *my fault*, right? I'm not invincible, just unaging.

This one's definition and ruleset sucks. Does everyone know who I am overnight? Can I rule from secret, meeting with world leaders who all secretly acknowledge my authority? Do the 12 ~~evil exes~~ rebel scum *also* acknowledge my right to rule, per item #1? Do they simply always assume the worst and pick at the edges? Are they immune to my commands? If I say, 'no one is allowed to try and kill me', will they accept that? If I order the world to never undermine my rule, do they have to obey, thus making themselves useless? What, exactly, IS my power over others?

Disappointing. At *best*, it is simply RL++, which means I likely simply ignore the authority powers as soon as I discover the ""people expect me to rule well"" part. After that, I go about my business in obscurity while living forever.

Sooner or later, that McDonalds I accidentally took Dominion over will go out of business, and my rule will fall into the shadows of history, as will I.

Worst case, it is an inevitable death sentence, as those 12 people are not constrained as to how to take me out. Nor is *anyone else*.

"Are you sure you're not me? Honestly, what you described just now is exactly how I felt while in a relationship! I would neglect my hobbies and even friends and family because all I could focus on was them/us. Worst of all, I would go out of my way to engage in activities and hobbies they liked to ""have something in common to do"". Even worse than that: how they sometimes downplayed my tastes and instead suggested I did something else, which led me to not want to show them what I liked to do in my free time in the first place. How very toxic and incredibly dumb... Not sure if you relate but yeah.

Even now, as I'm broken up but still living with my ex, I feel like even though that overwhelming cloud has drifted away a bit, I'm still not 100% focused. It's like he sucks all my energy and attention from just existing in the house. Insane, but true.

A healthy relationship requires both parties to be independent and spend time for themselves/apart. But it's crazy how easy it is to lose oneself... 

So glad you're doing you again! It's never too late, honestly, and now you know to look for a healthy relationship instead. Being alone is not only great but necessary and it's shocking how many people have never given their romantic lives a breather. I know it's super scary but it's a good lesson, on top of genuinely being one of the best things you can do - to reconnect and find your true self again. It's especially difficult if you suffer from depression, anxiety, etc. and find that relationships ""distracted"" you from those issues because you were so consumed by them, you had no time or energy left to think about your problems. (Yup, me.) It's addicting and it will come to a point where you can no longer run away - only face them head on, and deal with all the repression.

it sounds to me like she got to you at a very young age and really made you feel worthless at times.  even if you understand what what she said was stupid and insane, its sometimes still hard to shake the feeling if she was able to get to you at a young age (under 20).  

the reason she is like this is (most likely) because someone did it to her.  she has insecurities about who she is and feels like a failure.  i know that hearing that probably doesn't suddenly make you feel better (or maybe it does), but i feel like it helps to understand why people treated you the way they did.  it isn't normally your fault.

my best advice to you is to continue to try and do good in school, but put your happiness first.  in my opinion, thats all that really matters.   now, dont fool this for ""be irresponsible.""  sometimes, putting up with crap (like a job you dont like) helps do things like pay for rent, food, movies, etc etc.  be happy, but keep the future in mind.  work hard towards things YOU want. 

but dont beat yourself up over failures.  for example, im terrible at history and i didnt get a single A through university on history (of which i was required to take 5 miserable classes).  i even failed one (i blame the fact that the teacher was totally insane...not like laugh at her insane, but she would laugh even when it didnt make sense and everyone was terrified of her; like seriously fucking detached from reality insane).  was that my fault?  i really dont feel guilty.  i wish i hadnt taken the class ever, but if i could go back, things would probably be the same.

sorry, difted off, my point was: you are human.  humans make mistakes.  if you focus on ""man, i messed up, i wish that hadnt happened, things would be so much better if that hadnt happened""... change your thoughts more towards ""how can i learn from this?  if i could go back in time, would i do it again?""  accept who you are and focus on improving who you already are.  if you focus on who you want to be, youll forget to look at yourself in your current state sometimes.

to give another example from my life, i just bought a ""special edition"" of a video game recently for a lot of money.  after opening it and seeing whats inside that made it so ""special"" i really kind of feel like i wasted my money.  BUT, on the other hand, im supporting a group of game developers that i really like.  i like being able to play their games and what to support them anyway i can.  so even if the material value wasn't worth it, ive logiced my way into feeling like it was worth it.

I'm a Mason!!
Okay okay, as excited as I am to post about my wedding I'm going to hold off until my pictures are ready. 
Until then, I'm going to write all about my incredibly interesting wedding night. 
...Well, not all the details... 
So, Ken and I stayed at a B&amp;B for our wedding night. We were convinced that it may just be our first and only night as a married couple. It was one of the oddest and most uncomfortable experiences in my life, but has made for a very funny story. Here's just a small taste of our adventure. There is so much more to it so feel free to ask for details.My mom was kind enough to book us a B&amp;B for our wedding night... It seemed like a good idea at the time. 
Turns out she booked us the most bonkers bed and breakfast of all time. That's right, and B&amp;B&amp;B...
The only thing that would've made it better would've been if the bed had a coin slot where I could put quarters in that would make the bed vibrate. 

We were also treated to the most decadent of chocolates - Misty Mints. 

The owner repeatidly INSISTED that we could make as much noise as we wanted. ""Nobody can hear you scream."" Which was especially frightening due to the amount of axes, pitchforks, and seemingly mass grave in the backyard. 

We were quite pleased to see that the room came with a TV as well as a handmade clock. This clock was made with pearls, doilies, and fake flowers. It is purely for aesthetics. It doesn't actually work at all. 

There was a fine selection of VHS tapes. Everything from The Bible to Ace Ventura-When Nature Calls!


And my favorite part of the entire experience... 
The artwork. Upon entering the owner pointed to this painting and said ""Yes. I paint. This is a social commentary on marriage and how it can be very abusive. See all the opposites?...Ya.. My first two marriages were VERY abusive....This one's...all right...."" 

Other entertaining parts: 
In the morning as we ate breakfast the owner repeatidly offered to give me painting lessons.
She complained about how hard it is to write a book. ""I'm writing 3 books...at the same time...And I just can't decide if I should write them so they can be put into a movie. It's really hard.""
There was actually veery delicious jam on the breakfast table that was in an old salsa jar. Ken jokingly asked me to ""pass the salsa"". She then bolted into the kitchen saying ""It's not salsa!"" 
...There was soo so much more, but I've blocked almost all things from my memory at this point.

Others have every right to combat this, but the US also has a right to be merciless in destroying opposition.

There is no morality, no right, no wrong, no one cares. There is only what is. And the US got to economic and nuclear dominance first— and therefore until it collapses everyone else has to listen, and be thankful for not being destroyed.

Some people find this refreshing, since it's pretty much a given anymore that candidates are going to spout whatever bullshit they think will compel voters. So, his ""honesty"" is a rare thing.

"Great Fan Fiction piece I think of everytime I see Inspector Gadget Now:

Inspector Gadget was basically Get Smart meets RoboCop: A bumbling inspector with robotic enhancements fights crime with the help of his young niece and her dog, both of whom are vastly smarter than him. Gadget's main antagonist is the evil Dr. Claw, whose face is never revealed in the series and, according to a theory posted on various sites, that's because Dr. Claw is the real Inspector Gadget. The main character is actually a robot duplicate of the man Claw once was, who was driven insane by an accident and now wants to destroy the machine that replaced him. But there's no way that makes sense, right? There are a lot of things that the show never bothered to explain, and this theory covers them better than the crappy live-action movie ever did. For starters, why does Gadget have robot parts? It seems unlikely that he would have been chosen for some sort of police-enhancing program, considering that he's a total moron and all. No, there had to be some sort of tragic accident in his past, but he doesn't seem to remember it. Then there's Dr. Claw: Not only do we never see his face in the show (the action figure that revealed it came out years after the show had gone off the air), but the only thing we see is his metal hand, almost like an artificial limb. Also, his voice sounds like someone fellating a garbage disposal -- it's pretty obvious that Claw was involved in some sort of accident, too. Coincidence? We think not. According to the theory, ""Claw"" was once a normal human detective, but a terrible explosion caused his family and friends to think him dead. That's where his conveniently smart niece comes in: Penny, in her grief, recreated her uncle as a crime-fighting robot ... ignoring that the real man wasn't dead, only disfigured and insane. This would also explain why nothing ever happens to Penny, even though Claw's cronies seem to catch her every episode: She always finds a way to ruin Claw's plans because she's the only thing he still cares for.
And hey, remember the part at the end of the opening theme where Gadget turns Claw's chair around and there's a bomb in it? A bomb that then explodes in Gadget's face? Perhaps this was meant to be symbolic. Perhaps there's no Claw, just Gadget.

TLDR: [The Claw is the real Inspector Gadget](http://www.cracked.com/article_19882_6-insane-but-convincing-fan-theories-about-kids-cartoons.html). Just something fun to think about while watching the series again.

"Disney is Marvel is Marvel Studios is Whedonverse. The only properties not owned by Marvel/Whedonverse are those which already have a movie franchise out by someone else (FF, DD, Spider-Man etc).

Well all of the villians fit honestly. They are all political opponents, trying to steal the throne by combat or guile. 

White Wolf is the head of Wakanda's black ops wing, which Black Panther disbanded when he ascended to the throne - he's the white adopted brother of T'Challa who thinks a king needs to get his hands dirty. 

Achebe is an insane but charismatic preacher who was part of a successful coup and exile of the Panther to the US, after an influx of refugees from a war he personally caused. He was part of some excellent political manuevering.

Man-Ape is the leader of the Panther tribes big rivals, and has been trying to steal the throne from birth. Wakanda is a lot of tribes constantly vying for dominance but has been led by the Panther tribe for a long time - they are animal cunning where the Ape Tribe is brute force.

Killmonger is a re-patriated american-borne Wakandan who built himself up from nothing to get the genius, wealth and fighting prowess of the Panther. His most famous ploy was total economic takeover of Wakanda's companies through stock manipulations, after which he beat Black Panther to death. He runs a powerful totalitarian portion of the Wakanda (it has a state-system similar to the US where they can vary quite a lot) and is every bit Panther's equal. Panther had to crash the world economy and get himself murdered to save the country. When Panther actually beats him (he loses a lot), its through some of the most ingenius and cunning plans in comicbooks.

I'd go for Achebe first, setting up White Wolf in story and Killmonger in background.

This Chris Pratt? The badass Special Forces guy from Zero Dark Thirty? 

http://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/chris-pratt-reveals-six-pack-abs-for-zero-dark-thirty-60-pound-weight-gain-for-starbuck-20121912

Sounds like he had to gain a bunch of weight for a different role. He had to get real flabby for some comedy movie he filmed after Zero Dark Thirty and now he's going to have to get super buff and lean for some movie where he's playing a super hero. 

Sounds a lot like the extreme body changes Christian Bale has had to go through to get his body to fit the various roles he plays. He got himself down to an extremely anorexic weight for The Machinist and back up to a ripped superhero in the span of a year. The guy is insane, but incredibly dedicated.

"It turns out that daring to take chances suits me.  I tried living the safe life when I was married, and the resulting depression wrecked me.  I had a friend that thought I was insane for walking away from my marriage.   My ex had just finished her training as an MD/Phd, and would have supported me, so long as I never really reached my potential (she had strong narc traits, and was very threatened by the idea that I might overshadow her, yes, really).  But, she was happy to support me while I used pot to deal with the depression I had.  As I told her when I left her, you defile the goodness in me, and you encourage the broken in me.  When I left, I felt like there was nothing left of me, but I rose out of that, and am making 3x what I made 5 years ago as a programmer, and doing very well.  But isn't that what the message is about, that in order to find life, we must be willing to die, to let all that is broken go, and rise out of the ashes?  A comfortable life meant nothing to me if it was a life without meaning.  I did the same thing when my parents disowned me for pursuing music at age 19.  I refused to budge until they came back months later, risking homelessness.  Comfort is far less attractive to me than it is most people.  I would much rather live in a world with exciting possibilities, but a risk of severe consequence, than die of the protracted terminal illness known as stagnation.

&amp;#x200B;

In terms of problems that come up, well, much like INFJs can use their intuition to see things coming and avoid disaster, I've found my intuition is great at dealing with problems and coming up with solutions to the impossible on the fly, and that I LIKE the challenge.  It is weird, and insane, but disaster emboldens me to rise to the occasion.  So, getting into jams that are ""impossible"" to get out of doesn't really deter me, they excite me.  

&amp;#x200B;

That's not to say that I go to efforts to make mistakes, miss the mark, or sin.  Instead, it is that I believe that often times the real sin is failing to take a chance so one can delude themselves into thinking they are perfect.  I make mistakes, because I believe it is worth it, because I believe that trying to do something original, good, meaningful, creative, and that helps push society forward, is one of those things that makes life worth living.  Making mistakes matters less to me than my overall trajectory.  Course corrections are ok, so long as I am attempting to head in the right direction.  Anything beats stagnation, at least from the ENTP persepctive.  I'm not saying it is ""right"", or the proper way to live, but it suits me.","it is weird, and insane, but disaster emboldens me to rise to the occasion.","weird, and insane","insane","but",TRUE,"weird , and insane","weird",NA,NA,0,"reddit",0.07061,"thick_non-moral_concepts_NEG","negative",NA,NA,"thick_non-moral_concepts"

"This was asked a while back, so I just copied my response again. The brains of the Think Tank: before the war, they worked with holograms, sonic frequency, genetic manipulation, cybernetics, stealth tech, weather control, auto-docs, toxins (Sierra Madre red toxin), lobotomites, and a metal known as Saturnite. Most of these innovations were tested on Chinese-American prisoners in the Little Yangtze concentration camp (think Nazi experiments on humans). Other experiments were tested over entire pre war communities, i.e. Sierra Madre Casino and Hopeville (The Divide). The ""bad guy"" is actually revealed to be insane, but ethical. He saw that the outside world would be at the mercy of Big Mountain, and thus gave the Think Tank a reason to stay there by making them scared of him. If I remember correctly, Mobius (the supposed bad guy) kept rewiring the Think Tanks way of thinking. When they got close to remembering life outside of Big Mountain, he made them forget (anyone correct me if i'm wrong). Also, as a precaution, he added pylons that would shut the brains down if they ever tried to escape Big Mountain. Anyways, when Elijah and Ulysses came to Big M, Elijah learned about the tech there and fashioned himself an improved Tesla Cannon, LAER, and a Holorifle. He worked on making the collars of Little Yangtze prisoners work (they were still alive after all this time due to ghoulification). This is how he TRIES to gets people to cooperate at the Sierra Madre Villa. At the same time, Christine is on a mission to hunt down Elijah and kill him (as they are ex-BoS), because Elijah was the predecessor of Elder McNamara (current leader of the BoS at Hidden Valley), and he left the BoS to die at Helios One during the NCR attack on them. She ends up getting caught, as Elijah sees her and sends robots to capture her. She is almost turned into a lobotomite. Ulysses saves her, but she suffers damage to her brain and voice box, due to the experiments done on her. Ulysses found Big M by way of trails that led from Big M to The Divide. Ulysses takes care for her back in his camp at ""Ulysses Point."" They discuss things. Christine: her mission. Ulysses: his philosophy. At some point they separate, but not before Christine gives a recorder to Ulysses, as a way of repaying her debt to him. That's how Ulysses has logs scattered all over Hopeville/The Divide. Elijah met the Think Tank, and asked questions they themselves started to wonder about. He ended up attacking 0 and 8, which ended up making 8's voice module malfunction (that's why the Think Tank now has a pacification field when you enter it). Elijah and Ulysses end up crossing paths, and so Ulysses points Elijah towards the Sierra Madre. Ulysses finally meets the brains at the Think Tank and asks them ""Who are you, that do not know your history?"" That set them off, as they remembered ""America, the Old World."" Elijah escaped by smashing trains into each other. Christine soon followed. Ulysses also escaped, and returned to the Mojave Express, only to see your name on the list of the 7 Couriers that were to deliver things to Mr. House. I am assuming you know the story behind The Divide. If not, long story short: Ulysses hates your guts for creating what once was Hopeville (now known as part of The Divide), and then INDIRECTLY destroying it. He grew to love the community, as it were. He saw a part of pre war America that was not the corrupt NCR nor the tyrannical Legion. And all of this, ended up tying together Dead Money, somewhat Honest Hearts (Ulysses is softly mentioned by Joshua Graham), Old World Blues, and Lonesome Road. Anyway, that was enough for the Think Tank to make them send a satellite to check the outside world, and thus, you are teleported to the Think Tank. So in the end, Elijah went to the Sierra Madre in search of new technology that would bring the NCR to its knees, with Christine following him, and Ulysses eventually returned to The Divide to make his ultimate plan. As for the Think Tank, that is only known by the Courier.

* Erikson is an anthropologist/archaeologist, so the background cultures are fleshed out to an insane degree; races and cities aren't just stage-props, they're whole histories unto themselves, and any one of them would be worthy of its own epic. 
* The emotional engagement. Poignant doesn't begin to describe it - reading his books is like being beaten bloody with a sack of Latvian jokes. He will bring you to your knees with tragedy, then throw insane black comedy out out out of fucking *nowhere* leaving you deranged with slightly hysterical laughter, swing round and kick you in the head with tragedy while you're incapacitated, then drop a hundred-pound social-commentary rock on your back while you're down. Fuck.
* Even the goddamn *chapter-heading quotes* have the stopping-power of a cupboard door to the eyebrow. 
* The size/scope/density. It's like Game of Thrones *squared*, played not between piddling little kinglets, but between empires, gods, elder gods, ancient races and stuff it would take too long to explain. 
* The intensity of the prose. To quote Erikson himself:

&gt; A couple years back it occurred to me that I never really learned how to write a novel: I learned how to write short stories, and when I set to writing a novel I simply scaled up. So you can consider the ten book series as the longest short story ever written. I approached every line as if under the burden of carrying as much information as it could withstand, balanced against the elegance, rhythm, word-choice, of the sentence itself. Just like in a short story. It's no wonder the books do well as re-reads, because let's face it, who reads a novel as if it was short story? The text is packed. It's bursting at the seams. I must have been insane.

"""How about prosecuting her after the first case?""

That was the issue I was trying to address. Setting a precedent for prosecuting women who accuse a man of rape and end up losing the case (that is what is happening at this point) can easily be problematic. What happens if this person was actually raped, and the system simply failed to find this accused man guilty? Then the rape victim is now being accused of a crime herself, which is insane. But in this particular case, of course, it is easy to look at this woman who has falsely accused 8 men of rape and to call her insane and reprehensible. This is clearly an extreme case of the central problem at hand, which is what to do with those who falsely accuse people, and how to tell the different between them and those whom the legal system has failed. 

Edit: when I said ""that is what is happening at this point"" I am referring to the hypothetical first case to which you refer.","but in this particular case, of course, it is easy to look at this woman who has falsely accused 8 men of rape and to call her insane and reprehensible.","insane and reprehensible","insane","but",FALSE,"insane and reprehensible","reprehensible",NA,NA,1,"reddit",-0.12046,"thick_non-moral_concepts_NEG","negative",NA,NA,"thick_non-moral_concepts"

"A couple years ago I spent all night in Kansas City Missouri with a white woman who’s family had lived there for a hundred years and who also somehow spoke better Arabic and French than I did despite being native.

"I would suggest doing exactly as you said: weigh carbs dry and meat raw.

I've tried doing it both ways on carbs, as an experiment. I inevitably was overserving myself rice or noodles or whatever. It's just really hard to estimate when cooked.

With meat, I'd be lost without weighing it first. Pork, for instance, is so lean in the US that it tends to be soaked in a solution of salt water. Depending on the brand, might be as much as ""contains up to 37% solution of"" followed by what they added. You know a lot comes out when you're cooking something that's over a third water. And it's weight vs calories won't be comparable to pork with only 12% solution. So weigh it raw and, if available, use the calories from tha meat producer (from the package or website). 

I eat Perdue chicken, for instance, and it contains way less solution than my grocery store's chicken breasts, so they have slightly different nutritional info.

I know this sounds insane, but little overservings add up quickly. Weighing everything while it's raw becomes second nature. I just weighed my coffee creamer, for instance. The fruit and veggies are crucial, too. They can add up very quickly. 

If you do this and still don't lose weight, then it's time to talk to your doctor and bring your logs to show you've weighed everything that goes into your mouth.","i know this sounds insane, but little overservings add up quickly.","insane, but little","insane","but",TRUE,"insane , but little","little",NA,NA,1,"reddit",0.26932,"thick_non-moral_concepts_NEG","negative",NA,NA,"thick_non-moral_concepts"

"What I'm going to say may be seen as a joke, but the Father probably, is a bit insane, but more sane then insane.

But why it would not be insane?

"In America, some places have Planned Parenthoods that will give you HRT if you sign an informed consent form. You may think, based on your responses, ""well that sounds bad"" but it really isn't. There are so many hoops we have to jump through that vary from state to state that informed consent is one of the best options in places that have it.

We also have a problem with mental health treatments in general. Therapy is pretty much never covered by insurance, so you're stuck paying exorbant prices for it. On top of that, we don't really screen our mental health ""professionals"" well enough. There is a therapy clinic in my town where literally every therapist has been accused of sexual harassment and none of them have gotten even a warning. I was one of the victims. Now I'm looking at the only 2 therapists left in my town and both are unaffordable. So its either get sexually harassed and possibly assaulted or no therapy at all. For me. Usually its just unaffordable or inaccessible.

And then gender therapists are incredibly rare and a good portion of ""gender therapists"" are actually conversion therapists or are massive gatekeepers like transmeds. ""Oh, you expressed the tiniest bit of doubt? You aren't trans. Start over.""

In America, requiring *anything* for trans medical care that we usually have to pay for ourselves anyway is insane, but common, and it kills. I'm not even allowed to change my gender marker on my legal documents until I have letters saying i've had ""sufficient treatment"" but how do I get that treatment if I need letters or proof of gender based therapy for that too? It's impossible. All that does is create these long ass, unnecessary wait times and drains our funds, which sucks even more when you factor in that trans people are more likely to live in poverty.

"/r/Baccano mod here...unfortunately doing what I did two days ago, which is to write a comment for this episode on the same day the next episode (12.5 in this case) is due to go up. Welp.

I'm not keen on spending the same amount of time on this comment as I did Episode 11's, so I'm going to try to keep this on the shorter side (and I imagine some will be relieved, heh). 

I believe the confrontation between Seiji, Mika, Celty, and Mikado didn't happen out in the open space of the square like it seems to do here. 

In the novel, Celty and Mikado hide in the shadows of an alleyway near the square to avoid being picked up by the police. (Since Mikado is wearing his school jacket in the LN, he's worried that will definitely identify him/lead to punishment). None of the passersby snitch to the police, and the police leave.

Once they do, Celty walks back to the van where ""her head [is] sitting"" aka the amnesiac girl (Mika) -- and Seiji stabs her in the back unexpectedly, as opposed to her taking the blade purposefully in Mikado's stead. Seiji hops into the van, with none of the watching Van Gang trying to stop him, and pulls Mika out of the van: ""I've come for you. Let's go.""

And Mika agrees. All (except Izaya) are in varying degrees of shock. Seiji tells Mikado that he (Seiji) owes a lot to Mikado and Namie; Mikado starts to ask if Seiji really killed someone, Seiji says he ""might"" have, and he cites the power of love. The others surround him, he compares Mikado to a ""third-rate villain"" and assumes Mikado has never been in love; he swings the scalpel downward...

..At which point Celty swings down with her blade, which he dodges. Ultimately Mika does step in front of the scythe's path and scream, ""Stop!"" The clips shown of Mika outside Seiji's door are taken from the Prologue, which if you remember is where the scene with Seiji by (Mika's) body also came from.

Seiji having failed to recognize Mika's 'head' was not the real ting... *ouch*.

""You're definitely not a stalker"" / Mikado just because you say she wasn't acting out of selfishness doesn't mean her actions weren't stalker-y...

Shinra, you selfish little... \*cue unkind grumblings*.

From the novel:

&gt; “I’m not going to say that I’ll give up if that’s truly what will make you happy. This is a battle of your love against mine. Remember what I said? I will spare no effort in seizing victory in our game of fate. So that poor girl—Mika, her name was? I used her in an attempt to make you give up on your head. I’m not going to let you go. I will use the love of others, their deaths, my own self, even your own emotions to keep you here—as contradictory as that sounds.” 

&gt; In a way, his words were extremely twisted and insane, but there was no doubt clouding his eyes. That was what broke Celty’s will. If he’d played dumb or given her some lame excuse, she would have beaten him until he couldn’t stand and left, never to return. But after such a strong, direct statement of intent, Celty had no response.

Celty's jabbed/poked at Shinra before, but the punch she gives him here is... Well, there's some real serious emotion that led up to that punch, and Shinra's non-punch back seriously does not excuse the crap he's pulled. Oooh, you sneaky, no-good...

Mika leading a stunned Seiji around...that boy sure had a nasty shock, huh. Teenagers. I swear.

&gt; Kadota and Izaya meet, old high school classmates that they are

&gt; Izaya immediately calls him his hated nickname Dotachin

&gt; Erika calls him Dotachin

Poor Kadota just can't catch a break. I *think* the scene where he speaks with Izaya (in person for the first time in ages) + the Izaya-Mikado conversation is meant to happen *before* the Seiji-Mika reveal...

...Eh, what's more important is highlighting what Izaya remarked to Mikado:

&gt; “But while you may be dreaming of a life outside the bounds of normality, life in Tokyo will become normal after you’ve been here for a year. If you still want the abnormal, you’ll need to either move somewhere else or get into drugs, prostitution, or whatever lies even deeper underground.""

&gt; [...] “Life becomes normal even for the people on the other side of the tracks. Take the plunge for yourself, and you’ll be used to it in three days. And people like you can never bear that. ...If you truly want to escape the ordinary, you’ll simply need to keep evolving—whether what you seek is above or below.”

(From the YP translation).

*That* is definitely something to remember for the coming episodes/seasons.

Anyway... Shizuo doesn't show up and do his ""Iiiizaaayaaa"" routine here in the LNs. Mikado simply bows as Izaya leaves; Izaya turns around, says he's been wanting to glimpse the person who created something ""as dumb as"" the Dollars, and does the ""Hang in there, Tarou Tanaka!"" namedrop as he walks off. 

I think this isn't the only time the anime's decided to throw in extra Shizuo-Izaya rivalry scenes/amp it up, I but don't quote me on that. It's *probably* safe to say they really like capitalizing on it.

**Seiji:** I don't love you, but I guess you're a reminder of my love/dedication toward the real deal, soooo okay sure, I'll accept your love until I get her back. then it's quits, sweet cheeks

**Mika:** I was born ready and have no problems with this arrangement. [She thinks this next bit in the volume, but the anime cuts out her reply so I think they're saving this specific sentiment for the future](/s ""in the meantime I will sacrifice everything for you and do whatever it takes to help you find the real head. You know, so I can eat it and become it. for your sake."")

&gt; A love between them that would last until the moment their true love came true. 

&gt; A love that was so straightforward and so terribly twisted.

&gt; The sight of them was so delicate and precious--and so horribly, horribly wrong. 

(From the LN). Yeah honestly Narita that might be a bit of an understatement....

This episode explicitly confirms TarouTanaka = Mikado and Setton = Celty for the viewers who didn't fully appreciate either up to this point. 

Mikado is surprised to see Seiji and Mika attending classes, but between the two he's more surprised that Mika's showed up. Also, I think she's meant to have a bandage around her neck (rather than blatantly exposing the scar to the school)...

I might repeat this factoid later since I'm not sure how many people will return to this episode thread, but: Raira Academy *does* permit students to wear casual clothes, which is while Mika can get away with her attire here... 

...However, although most people are wearing the Raira uniform in the anime, in the novels its actually people who *wear* the uniforms who stand out (e.g. Mikado and Anri). 

&gt; There's that merger with Nebula

As if I were *not* going to call out every mention of Nebula... In this case, Yagiri Pharmaceuticals *and* Nebula have been observing the incidents surrounding [Namie's/Yagiri's] research lab for the past several days, so they've been wanting to finish the merger deal before any more 'nonsense' goes down. 

And Nebula wants ""the dullahan's head,"" of course... But Namie will give the head to them before hell freezes over, so she's fled Yagiri in search of somewhere she can hide the head and have some measure of control over where it might be. 

Izaya, it seems, is her only choice. One of desperation, really. 

Izaya in the LN: *""I think your uncle was a lot like me. He believed in the afterlife less than anyone else. He feared death more than anyone else. And he craved heaven more than anyone else.""

...I told myself this wouldn't be as long as the Episode 11 comment, and look at me now... bleh. I think it didn't take as long to write as Episode 11's comment did, so that's something at least...?! 

With that said, it's 1 PM so there's less than 3 hours until the next episode thread, so I might skip Fanart Corner for this episode (sorry). In any case, we've pretty much wrapped up the first volume with the closing off this arc (the Dollars/Mika Harima arc), so prepare for new shenanigans in the second half...","i will use the love of others, their deaths, my own self, even your own emotions to keep you here—as contradictory as that sounds.”   &gt; in a way, his words were extremely twisted and insane, but there was no doubt clouding his eyes.","twisted and insane","insane","but",FALSE,"extremely twisted and insane","twisted",NA,"extremely",0,"reddit",0.12208,"thick_non-moral_concepts_NEG","negative",NA,NA,"thick_non-moral_concepts"

"After some introspection, I've decided that my current morality is based on whatever is overall best for human survival.  Currently, rape and murder are obviously immoral because it's disharmonious and causes social turmoil which is detrimental to human life and advancement.

If we suppose a God, then his power over humanity dictates my adherence to his will.  If he orders the murder of an individual then it is moral to do so because of the possible severe consequences of disobedience (he kills 1,000 people instead or sends all of us to hell. Also the possible benefits of obedience Ex: Kill this person and he wipes out AIDS - a net positive for humanity).  Does this mean God is immoral to order such a thing when he could have just cured AIDS outright? Possibly. In my opinion it's too complex an issue.  I don't believe god is something I could quantify as good or evil as I couldn't possibly begin understand him.  Perhaps there's some universal-level rationale and coherence (or maybe he's completely chaotic and insane) but it would be beyond me. Maybe it's all for the overall benefit of humanity, maybe not.  I would classify god as I currently would a volcanic eruption, asteroid, or any other event beyond our control. You do what's necessary or face destruction. If someone has a different opinion then that's for them to figure out.","perhaps there's some universal-level rationale and coherence (or maybe he's completely chaotic and insane) but it would be beyond me.","chaotic and insane","insane","but",FALSE,"completely chaotic and insane","chaotic",NA,"completely",0,"reddit",-0.09886,"thick_non-moral_concepts_NEG","negative",NA,NA,"thick_non-moral_concepts"
"It's not God... it's Skynet... sort of.

We know that the reapers are machines.  Machines don't build themselves so it follows that many many cycles ago -- billions of years perhaps -- there were no Reapers.

We know that the reapers don't innovate.  Part of the harvesting process is incorporating the advancements of organic civilizations into the Reapers.  

We know that Reaper intelligence is not a hive-mind like the Geth but a series of independent unshackled AIs... like EDI.  

If follows then that, at some time in the past, an organic civilization created AI -- probably more than one and that one of the AIs rebelled against them.  There was a war; the creators lost, the rebelling AI was destroyed, but one of the creators' AI's survived, presumably one that did not seek the destruction of the creators.  This is the AI that you encounter on the Citadel: the Lone Survivor of the first war between organics and synthetics.  

It mourned the loss of its creators alone... and it waited.  Perhaps it waited with a vast and galaxy spanning network of Mass Effect relays and other advanced structures at its disposal having already constructed the Reaper fleet in the war or perhaps it sat languishing in memory somewhere until it was discovered by another organic civilization.

One images that the AI watched that civilization develop or begin to develop synthetic life and, in a corruption of the Zeroth law of Robotics (more or less) acted to ""save"" them.  It crushed them and preserved them in Reaper form.  The AI went back to sleep and then, 50,000 years or so later, it happened again.

In this cycle, the AI detects what it believes to be a pattern.  Organic life inevitably gives rise to Synthetic  life and Synthetic life, unhindered, will eventually exterminate ALL organic life.  This is the fundamental motive of the Reapers because it was given to them by their creator -- the Lone Survivor -- and, it might be argued, one that Shepard and the player fundamentally CAN'T understand, either because the Lone Survivor is insane or just because the Geth and EDI seem so cuddly.  

The Lone Survivor sees itself as a guardian of organic intelligence and the endless variation and promise that intelligence can deliver but, above all, it feels that it must safeguard -- harvest -- the ultimate product of organic life: organic intelligence, even if it means destroying the civilizations that intelligence gives rise to.  The Lone Survivor is fundamentally psychotic and fundamentally insane but it can't see that because it is alone in the Universe.  It sees only the children it creates -- the Reapers -- and the civilizations it harvests and can trust neither to provide an objective assessment of its own stability.  It only knows that the organics resist its attempts to save them and that, in the end, since they will not trust it, fear and horror are more productive than spurned attempts at incorporation and cooperation and so it uses its time and endless resources to build an unfathomably powerful war machine.

But the Lone Survivor has a weakness.  It needs a place to sleep, a place to execute.  It needs vast amounts of energy, upkeep, and above all information.  

And so it is dependent upon the Citadel; that's why it lives there; that's why it executes there; and that's why it manifests to Sheppard there.  

It sees the end coming.  With each passing cycle the organics get closer and closer to uncovering the truth.  Long years have taught the AI that, despite its best intentions, the organics will not submit to its ""wisdom"" and thus, with each cycle the margin of victory is slimmer.  The AI must learn, adapt, and advance at all costs if it is to survive the inevitable hostility of the organics to their ""salvation.""

And so, when Shepard has finally secured the Citadel, overcome the indoctrinated Illusive man, and lies gasping at the controls, the AI knows that the next cycle will bring its annihilation.  It has become what it sought to prevent and, if it allows the next cycle to happen, it will be destroyed by the organic life it so feverishly worked to preserve with the knowledge that that civilization will, once again, fall before its own creations.  It can not hope to win... and so it pleads for a stalemate.  It offers Shepard the illusion of choice, two choices it knows he has already rejected and one which it ultimately seeks.  

1. Control the Reapers -- the AI has already watched Shepard reject this line of reasoning from the Illusive man.  It knows that he doesn't want that end.

2. Merge Synthetic and Organic -- the AI saw Shepard reject this line of reasoning from Sarin.  Not going to happen.

3. Destroy the Reapers, the Mass Effect Gates, and all Synthetic life.

Option three is what the AI wants. It knows it can't keep up what it's doing but it also wants to protect organic life from its own tendency to build synthetics which, it believes, will kill them.  It knows the galaxy is seeded with organic civilizations and it knows that, without Mass Effect gates, it'll be a very very long time before anyone manages some kind of meaningful trans-galactic travel.  Punching the reset button on synthetic development while simultaneously compartmentalizing the galaxy offers the best chance for organics to survive the introduction of a hostile synthetic race.

"""How about prosecuting her after the first case?""

That was the issue I was trying to address. Setting a precedent for prosecuting women who accuse a man of rape and end up losing the case (that is what is happening at this point) can easily be problematic. What happens if this person was actually raped, and the system simply failed to find this accused man guilty? Then the rape victim is now being accused of a crime herself, which is insane. But in this particular case, of course, it is easy to look at this woman who has falsely accused 8 men of rape and to call her insane and reprehensible. This is clearly an extreme case of the central problem at hand, which is what to do with those who falsely accuse people, and how to tell the different between them and those whom the legal system has failed. 

Edit: when I said ""that is what is happening at this point"" I am referring to the hypothetical first case to which you refer.","but in this particular case, of course, it is easy to look at this woman who has falsely accused 8 men of rape and to call her insane and reprehensible.","insane and reprehensible","insane","but",FALSE,"insane and reprehensible","reprehensible",NA,NA,1,"reddit",-0.12046,"thick_non-moral_concepts_NEG","negative",NA,NA,"thick_non-moral_concepts"

"I could just name Tetris, but where's the fun in that?

Have you considered space simulations? Games like Freespace, Freelancer, the Elite series, the X-series or the upcoming Star Citizen? Alternatively, there's the Aquanox series of underwater games, which play quite similarly. I'm very fond of the second game in the series (technically third, since Archimedean Dynasty came before the first Aquanox). FTL also doesn't have trees and is entirely set in space, so if you haven't played this incredibly hard, brilliant, perfect little game, give it a try first.

Going through my list of games on Steam, there are so many games I can name, so here they are, all of them (might take a while): Abstract endless game Race The Sun doesn't have any trees. Just gray shapes, which are so abstract that nobody can clearly tell what they are most of the time. Hotline Miamia is set entirely in interiors, so no arboreal nightmares there as well. The Chronicles of Riddick Assault on Dark Athena is a magnificent stealth game that's set in a dark sci-fi prison (on a desert planet) and a space station. I don't remember ever seeing even a decorative shrub in this outstanding game. I Am Alive is a very flawed, but interesting post-apocalyptic game, more focused on narration than typical survival mechanics. The game's gray, nothing green to see. One of those hidden gems. Orcs Must Die 1 &amp; 2 are action-heavy pseudo-tower defense games. Very frantic and enjoyable, highly polished and the only green things in them are Orks. Receiver is a short experimental game focusing on guns. Extremely interesting. Spec Ops the Line is a must-have game, a modern interpretation of The Heart of Darkness, one of the most impressive narrations of any game I've played. It's set in a decaying Dubai, so obviously no trees (IIRC). Groundbreaking narrative title Dear Esther (the first game to be called a walking simulator by people who always need to shoot stuff in games) also doesn't feature a single large brown thing with green stuff growing on it, because the island its set on is cold and barren, with just some meager bushes and grass covering the landscape. Speaking of bold narrative experiments without large brown things with green stuff growing on them, The Stanley Parable is almost entirely set in an office, which is naturally not a place for trees to grow. Trees also don't grow underwater, especially not on Alien planets, so have fun with excellent early access unter water survival and swimming the fuck away from *oh god what was that* simulator Subnautica. Alien planets don't need to be terrifying water worlds, they can also be covered in trash and populated by strange people, which is the setting of Daedelic's celebrated point and click adventure game series Deponia. As you can imagine, trees don't grow on trash (also the name of my new band). Machinarium on the other hand is set on a similar planet, this time entirely populated by robots and incredibly gorgeous. No trees, robots don't like those. Robots are a theme in the aptly named Choice of Robots, which is a text adventure. In Little Inferno, you are burning stuff (no trees IIRC), a strange game that slightly disappointed after the incredible, perfect and stunning World of Goo, which has lots of little goo creatures that can be used to solve puzzles - and some of them are green, goo monsters, not puzzles - but no arboreal thingies. AaAaAA!!! - A Reckless Disregard for Gravity (actual title) lets you jumps of things, for when you can't take this green planet anymore. You'll also get points for style and it's wonderfully weird and quirky. Audiosurf 1 and 2 are music-based games - just point them towards your directory of MP3s and they'll generate beautiful, abstract and entirely tree-free™ tracks. A ton of fun. Speaking of fun, I never imagined how much fun Cook, Serve, Delicious would be. It's a restaurant manager/cooking sim with just the right number of clever ideas, a charming presentation and gameplay that ranges from relaxing to frantic. People don't eat trees, so no trees to be seen (or eaten). Brilliant fun and the developer is a standup guy (got a Steam key after my Android version refused to work). 

*catching breath* Okay, a few more. Many more.

Pool Nation is a gorgeous and excellent pool game. Ignore the successor, ignore the F2P spinoff, ignore any other pool game, this is the one to have. Trees were harmed making tables and queues. Super Hexagon is yet another perfect little game. An intense electronic soundtrack, insane, but insanely fair difficulty and just the right balance of frustration and rewarding fun turn this title into one of my all time favorite games. Five minutes of this game are about as exhausting as three hours of any other title (or chopping down a you-know-what). Great mental workout. Surgeon Simulator. It's Youtuber-bait, but it's whacky fun. Since there are no trees, only people in it to ~~murder~~ operate on, and it being fairly cheap (and fun), I can recommend this for a cold evening in your summer home on a tree-free™ Peruvian high plateau. Gunpoint's setting is entirely urban, so nothing to fear. Fantastic little hacking/stealth game, the game Deus Ex always wanted to be, except it's 2D and your hero makes a lovely *splat* down when falling from a building. I love it just as much as you hate trees. In Thomas Was Alone, you are controlling Tetris pieces, yet somehow this game manages to tell a tree-free™, but touching storyline. A great Indie surprise hit. VVVVVV looks like a ZX-Spectrum game from back before trees were invented, but it's a great platformer/Metroidvania that doesn't have a jump button. Normally in a Metroidvania, you get further by the character gaining new equipment and skilly, but in this game, you get further by becoming better at playing it. Since it's bloody hard, this may take a while.

Halfway point. Hang in there.

Democracy 3. Slick UI, there might be a tree pictogram you can edit out. It's a politics simulator. Some people claim it's too hard and too complicated, I think it's too easy, so the truth is probably somewhere in the middle. Simulates politics with you deciding stuff. Fairly realistic, very accessible, teaches you a lot about how politics work. Frozen Synapse has a cyberpunk theme, so no trees, no Sir. Great turn-based tactics game, enjoyed it a lot. Universe Sandbox 1 &amp; Deux: What if the Moon was the size of the Earth? What if the Earth was the size of the Moon? What if I just lob them into each other and bring the entirety of *Andromeda* into play? Believe me, after a while there are no more green spots on mother Earth left, let alone an Earth to speak of. While we're at space, Red Faction Guerrilla is set on Mars, so it's again tree-free™, yet somehow people can still breathe there. Sorry for the pro-tree propaganda. Still the most impressive destruction engine of any game, just blow shit up and go home a happy ~~terrorist~~ freedom fighter. Abstract WTF-em-up Antichamber on the other hand will leave you happy (and tree-free™) as well, but also slightly to very confused. Non-euclidean spaces are the most harmless prank this puzzle game plays on you. Why not hack into something to get your mind of strange things? Uplink to the rescue, still one of my favorite Indie games with a smashing soundtrack and timeless gameplay. It's Hollywood-hacking, not realistic at all, which isn't a bad thing, because it's done so well in this title. If you're looking for something more realistic, less sandboxy and similarly focused on machines that don't grow on trees (nor have them growing in them), the Hacker Evolution series can help. Since you're basically programming in them, Human Resource Machine (aka first year of computer science simulator) shouldn't faze you. A thinking man's game, love it to bits (hehe). Osmos is eat or be eaten, with round orbs floating through tree-free™ ether. Still just as gorgeous as on the day it was released. 

Still got a few more. Fun fact: I recently killed a tree. A small one, but every little thing counts, right?

I actually managed to find a racing game without trees: Trackmania Nations. It's set in a stadium, hilariously unrealistic, entirely free without any IAPs and one of the best things that has ever happened to the racing game genre with possibly the largest selection of community-made tracks of any racing game. There's a successor that costs money, but only looks slightly better (but has massively higher hardware requirements) and doesn't add anything substantially new. Anachronox is an old and weird, but tree-free™ and interesting RPG. I love it's low-poly look, which has aged far better than most games from its era. System Shock and System Shock 2 area also old, have also aged well and are generally considered to be brilliant. Set on space stations and released only shortly after trees were invented, they lack the required technology to render them. Don't miss Bioshock's futuristic granddaddies! Tron 2.0 was heavily inspired by them and until Tron Legacy, it was the official continuation of the famous '80s movie with CGI elements. Great game by Monolith, who later made F.E.A.R., aka T.F.T.F.L.T.T.W.A.T.D. Since there are no trees on the grid, it gets the coveted tree-free™ seal of awesomeness. Nuclear Holocaust is fun, right? DEFCON certainly is, in a weird, eery thank fuck the Cold War is over kind of way. Definitely an experience.

"Are you sure you're not me? Honestly, what you described just now is exactly how I felt while in a relationship! I would neglect my hobbies and even friends and family because all I could focus on was them/us. Worst of all, I would go out of my way to engage in activities and hobbies they liked to ""have something in common to do"". Even worse than that: how they sometimes downplayed my tastes and instead suggested I did something else, which led me to not want to show them what I liked to do in my free time in the first place. How very toxic and incredibly dumb... Not sure if you relate but yeah.

Even now, as I'm broken up but still living with my ex, I feel like even though that overwhelming cloud has drifted away a bit, I'm still not 100% focused. It's like he sucks all my energy and attention from just existing in the house. Insane, but true.

A healthy relationship requires both parties to be independent and spend time for themselves/apart. But it's crazy how easy it is to lose oneself... 

So glad you're doing you again! It's never too late, honestly, and now you know to look for a healthy relationship instead. Being alone is not only great but necessary and it's shocking how many people have never given their romantic lives a breather. I know it's super scary but it's a good lesson, on top of genuinely being one of the best things you can do - to reconnect and find your true self again. It's especially difficult if you suffer from depression, anxiety, etc. and find that relationships ""distracted"" you from those issues because you were so consumed by them, you had no time or energy left to think about your problems. (Yup, me.) It's addicting and it will come to a point where you can no longer run away - only face them head on, and deal with all the repression. 

One of the reasons I was so emotionally dependent on my ex was because he helped me with my anxiety issues a lot - that is, until he started to contribute to them.

You should vote for reason, logic and willingness to help the population, you should not vote in favor of frustration, hatred and misinformation.

"Most people end up taking several attempts to finish GOTM - it's got a *really* steep immersion curve. 

As universal_straw points out, the quality increases vastly with the subsequent novels, and also you will get a lot more drawn in by then as well. 

What's good about it: 

* Erikson is an anthropologist/archaeologist, so the background cultures are fleshed out to an insane degree; races and cities aren't just stage-props, they're whole histories unto themselves, and any one of them would be worthy of its own epic. 
* The emotional engagement. Poignant doesn't begin to describe it - reading his books is like being beaten bloody with a sack of Latvian jokes. He will bring you to your knees with tragedy, then throw insane black comedy out out out of fucking *nowhere* leaving you deranged with slightly hysterical laughter, swing round and kick you in the head with tragedy while you're incapacitated, then drop a hundred-pound social-commentary rock on your back while you're down. Fuck.
* Even the goddamn *chapter-heading quotes* have the stopping-power of a cupboard door to the eyebrow. 
* The size/scope/density. It's like Game of Thrones *squared*, played not between piddling little kinglets, but between empires, gods, elder gods, ancient races and stuff it would take too long to explain. 
* The intensity of the prose. To quote Erikson himself:

&gt; A couple years back it occurred to me that I never really learned how to write a novel: I learned how to write short stories, and when I set to writing a novel I simply scaled up. So you can consider the ten book series as the longest short story ever written. I approached every line as if under the burden of carrying as much information as it could withstand, balanced against the elegance, rhythm, word-choice, of the sentence itself. Just like in a short story. It's no wonder the books do well as re-reads, because let's face it, who reads a novel as if it was short story? The text is packed. It's bursting at the seams. I must have been insane.

"/r/Baccano mod here...unfortunately doing what I did two days ago, which is to write a comment for this episode on the same day the next episode (12.5 in this case) is due to go up. Welp.

I'm not keen on spending the same amount of time on this comment as I did Episode 11's, so I'm going to try to keep this on the shorter side (and I imagine some will be relieved, heh). 

I believe the confrontation between Seiji, Mika, Celty, and Mikado didn't happen out in the open space of the square like it seems to do here. 

In the novel, Celty and Mikado hide in the shadows of an alleyway near the square to avoid being picked up by the police. (Since Mikado is wearing his school jacket in the LN, he's worried that will definitely identify him/lead to punishment). None of the passersby snitch to the police, and the police leave.

Once they do, Celty walks back to the van where ""her head [is] sitting"" aka the amnesiac girl (Mika) -- and Seiji stabs her in the back unexpectedly, as opposed to her taking the blade purposefully in Mikado's stead. Seiji hops into the van, with none of the watching Van Gang trying to stop him, and pulls Mika out of the van: ""I've come for you. Let's go.""

And Mika agrees. All (except Izaya) are in varying degrees of shock. Seiji tells Mikado that he (Seiji) owes a lot to Mikado and Namie; Mikado starts to ask if Seiji really killed someone, Seiji says he ""might"" have, and he cites the power of love. The others surround him, he compares Mikado to a ""third-rate villain"" and assumes Mikado has never been in love; he swings the scalpel downward...

..At which point Celty swings down with her blade, which he dodges. Ultimately Mika does step in front of the scythe's path and scream, ""Stop!"" The clips shown of Mika outside Seiji's door are taken from the Prologue, which if you remember is where the scene with Seiji by (Mika's) body also came from.

Seiji having failed to recognize Mika's 'head' was not the real ting... *ouch*.

""You're definitely not a stalker"" / Mikado just because you say she wasn't acting out of selfishness doesn't mean her actions weren't stalker-y...

Shinra, you selfish little... \*cue unkind grumblings*.

From the novel:

&gt; “I’m not going to say that I’ll give up if that’s truly what will make you happy. This is a battle of your love against mine. Remember what I said? I will spare no effort in seizing victory in our game of fate. So that poor girl—Mika, her name was? I used her in an attempt to make you give up on your head. I’m not going to let you go. I will use the love of others, their deaths, my own self, even your own emotions to keep you here—as contradictory as that sounds.” 

&gt; In a way, his words were extremely twisted and insane, but there was no doubt clouding his eyes. That was what broke Celty’s will. If he’d played dumb or given her some lame excuse, she would have beaten him until he couldn’t stand and left, never to return. But after such a strong, direct statement of intent, Celty had no response.

Celty's jabbed/poked at Shinra before, but the punch she gives him here is... Well, there's some real serious emotion that led up to that punch, and Shinra's non-punch back seriously does not excuse the crap he's pulled. Oooh, you sneaky, no-good...

Mika leading a stunned Seiji around...that boy sure had a nasty shock, huh. Teenagers. I swear.

&gt; Kadota and Izaya meet, old high school classmates that they are

&gt; Izaya immediately calls him his hated nickname Dotachin

&gt; Erika calls him Dotachin

Poor Kadota just can't catch a break. I *think* the scene where he speaks with Izaya (in person for the first time in ages) + the Izaya-Mikado conversation is meant to happen *before* the Seiji-Mika reveal...

...Eh, what's more important is highlighting what Izaya remarked to Mikado:

&gt; “But while you may be dreaming of a life outside the bounds of normality, life in Tokyo will become normal after you’ve been here for a year. If you still want the abnormal, you’ll need to either move somewhere else or get into drugs, prostitution, or whatever lies even deeper underground.""

&gt; [...] “Life becomes normal even for the people on the other side of the tracks. Take the plunge for yourself, and you’ll be used to it in three days. And people like you can never bear that. ...If you truly want to escape the ordinary, you’ll simply need to keep evolving—whether what you seek is above or below.”

(From the YP translation).

*That* is definitely something to remember for the coming episodes/seasons.

Anyway... Shizuo doesn't show up and do his ""Iiiizaaayaaa"" routine here in the LNs. Mikado simply bows as Izaya leaves; Izaya turns around, says he's been wanting to glimpse the person who created something ""as dumb as"" the Dollars, and does the ""Hang in there, Tarou Tanaka!"" namedrop as he walks off. 

I think this isn't the only time the anime's decided to throw in extra Shizuo-Izaya rivalry scenes/amp it up, I but don't quote me on that. It's *probably* safe to say they really like capitalizing on it.

**Seiji:** I don't love you, but I guess you're a reminder of my love/dedication toward the real deal, soooo okay sure, I'll accept your love until I get her back. then it's quits, sweet cheeks

**Mika:** I was born ready and have no problems with this arrangement. [She thinks this next bit in the volume, but the anime cuts out her reply so I think they're saving this specific sentiment for the future](/s ""in the meantime I will sacrifice everything for you and do whatever it takes to help you find the real head. You know, so I can eat it and become it. for your sake."")

&gt; A love between them that would last until the moment their true love came true. 

&gt; A love that was so straightforward and so terribly twisted.

&gt; The sight of them was so delicate and precious--and so horribly, horribly wrong. 

(From the LN). Yeah honestly Narita that might be a bit of an understatement....

This episode explicitly confirms TarouTanaka = Mikado and Setton = Celty for the viewers who didn't fully appreciate either up to this point. 

Mikado is surprised to see Seiji and Mika attending classes, but between the two he's more surprised that Mika's showed up. Also, I think she's meant to have a bandage around her neck (rather than blatantly exposing the scar to the school)...

I might repeat this factoid later since I'm not sure how many people will return to this episode thread, but: Raira Academy *does* permit students to wear casual clothes, which is while Mika can get away with her attire here... 

...However, although most people are wearing the Raira uniform in the anime, in the novels its actually people who *wear* the uniforms who stand out (e.g. Mikado and Anri). 

&gt; There's that merger with Nebula

As if I were *not* going to call out every mention of Nebula... In this case, Yagiri Pharmaceuticals *and* Nebula have been observing the incidents surrounding [Namie's/Yagiri's] research lab for the past several days, so they've been wanting to finish the merger deal before any more 'nonsense' goes down. 

And Nebula wants ""the dullahan's head,"" of course... But Namie will give the head to them before hell freezes over, so she's fled Yagiri in search of somewhere she can hide the head and have some measure of control over where it might be. 

Izaya, it seems, is her only choice. One of desperation, really. 

Izaya in the LN: *""I think your uncle was a lot like me. He believed in the afterlife less than anyone else. He feared death more than anyone else. And he craved heaven more than anyone else.""

...I told myself this wouldn't be as long as the Episode 11 comment, and look at me now... bleh. I think it didn't take as long to write as Episode 11's comment did, so that's something at least...?! 

With that said, it's 1 PM so there's less than 3 hours until the next episode thread, so I might skip Fanart Corner for this episode (sorry). In any case, we've pretty much wrapped up the first volume with the closing off this arc (the Dollars/Mika Harima arc), so prepare for new shenanigans in the second half...","i will use the love of others, their deaths, my own self, even your own emotions to keep you here—as contradictory as that sounds.”   &gt; in a way, his words were extremely twisted and insane, but there was no doubt clouding his eyes.","twisted and insane","insane","but",FALSE,"extremely twisted and insane","twisted",NA,"extremely",0,"reddit",0.12208,"thick_non-moral_concepts_NEG","negative",NA,NA,"thick_non-moral_concepts"

Title: **Roommate assaulted me and got away with it**

Original Post: 

&gt; My roommate just tried strangling me because I was walking around the house without a shirt (he's religious and insane), but when I called the cops, he called them too and said I assaulted him first.
&gt; 
&gt; The cops told me that because it's a ""he said, she said"" scenario, the most likely outcome if I don't drop the charges is that both of us will end up with assault charges on our record, so I didn't file charges.
&gt; 
&gt; This guy is a vile, racist, ignorant, manipulative sneak, but the landlord likes him because he does a lot of landscaping for free. Any suggestions?

Look, in the end this kind of thing is up to the states, just like each state has its own rules on the sale and distribution of alcohol. If it's true that a massive majority of *voters* wants it to be legal, then it will be.

Even in the blue states it would take years to put some kind of framework of regulation for sales into effect. We're better off using that time to push for state by state legalization, so that when it's legalized there's *already* a plan written by local people that they approve of and it can go into effect immediately.

Biden's plan does *so much* to encourage and hasten full legalization, as well as helping mitigate much of the harm the drug war has already caused.

"I drive more than most, and when I was younger I used to do the typical stupid shit including going at speeds well over 150 km/h. Top speed I've been at was 250 km/h, incredibly stupid and insane but I was to stuck up with the, it's not so bad attitude.

Doing 150 km/h on the 401 may not be unsafe . . . until you have something go wrong on your car, some other car, you fuck up, or someone else fucks up. Then it's all over but the burial's, but hey it save your a few minutes of your day right? Last year, doing 60 km/h I had a very small yet integral part of my steering system break, a simple ball joint. Thankfully I managed to control the car enough to put it across someones lawn and not into on coming traffic. At 150 km/h, I would sure as hell of hit something and most likely have been killed, even at 100 km/h I would have been in a very big pile of shit.

I skydive, I fall faster than most cars can move, and those speeds, 200 km/h, don't seem ""dangerous"" or ""scary"" to me, but I know that they are not to be toyed with. In under 5 seconds you travel one km, that means in less than you reaction time you travel 300 m, can you visualize 200 m ahead all the time driving? On the experience end of skydiving some people will be coming in under canopy at 100 km/h and you need to calculate your movements 80-100 feet ahead of time or you will react to slow.

The average eye to hand reaction time is 3/4 of a second if you are prepared, this number sky rockets if you are not. This is why in drivers-ed they beat you to death with the 4 second gap rule because it also takes a large fraction of a second to translate your reaction to your car's input.

Just to further add to it, hitting a barrier at 100 km/h there is roughly 100 g's exerted onto your body, at this amount of pressure you have a 50/50 chance of surviving just the force of the vehicle stopping, death usually occurs around 26 g but a car crash is only a very brief moment. At 200 km/h you are looking upwards of 400 g which would be instant death. 150 km/h sits in the middle, you do the math.

But I've said what I will, if you wish to travel at insanely high speeds because you don't understand the kinetic energy you're are carrying and how slow your reaction time really is, by all means put yourself and others at risk, hopefully you will get caught before hand and lose your license.","top speed i've been at was 250 km/h, incredibly stupid and insane but i was to stuck up with the, it's not so bad attitude.","stupid and insane","insane","but",FALSE,"incredibly stupid and insane","stupid",NA,"incredibly",0,"reddit",-0.50517,"thick_non-moral_concepts_NEG","negative",NA,NA,"thick_non-moral_concepts"

Lastly, while I like the trope that the original is an insane but otherwise identical clone, even I have to admit it's a tiny bit predictable. As a result, I'd try to give it a twist. Maybe he's NOT actually a clone, the wizard just wanted everyone to think he's dead for some reason. Maybe the reason there ARE other clones is that the clone who replaced the wizard just kept on cloning itself and made all these bad copies who then also tried to clone themselves... you know... Multiplicity style. Maybe there never was a wizard, just a fiend trying to use similar magic to be indistinguishable from a human and all these horrific monstrosities are the results. Whatever you decide, just take the predictable end and make it not quite what the players thought.

3. Ah, college. A great time in anyone's life. I have a buttload of advice to prepare for.

a.) Meals. While in college it is expected that you will take on debt. What advice can I counter to stop collected debt while there? Free meals. There are several events at my school in which I can obtain free food. These events are things such as farmer's market samples, surveys for fast food, etc. As you progress you will learn the in's and outs of each trick. In the event you are not on a food plan, ramen is king along with cheap sandwich choices, and the occasional canned good. Always remember: when someone offers you to pay the bill, you accept. When my parents offer to take me out I will accept 99.99% of the time. And finally: home cooked meals are much better than fast food or eateries. They are both healthier and cheaper, and will often taste better with the use of crock pots, rice cookers, microwave ovens, and other appliances.

b.) Be active. Don't get stuck on playing games and letting your grades slack, but don't let your grades stop you from being active and maintaining a social life. My definition of activity is inclusions of a job, and frequent visits to the gym. Many freshman become fat simply from either overindulgence when on meal plans and low activity or even mental problems such as loneliness or self inflicted low confidence. In order to keep both your physical well being and your mental well being in check, make sure you do SOMETHING that gets you out of the dorm room and inactivity that many fall trap to the first year away from home.

b. part 2.) GOOD MUSIC. Now I know this might seem insane, but good music is very encouraging and will keep you active.  It will get you off your feet and looking in the mirror saying:  ""what workout should I do today?"" In a way, music can be all the motivation you need.

c.) WORK HARD. Might seem cliche, but maintaining a job and taking in as low debt as possible is KING in college, unless you want to have an awful credit score after graduation day. If you have supportive parents, keep a great relationship and communicate frequently. Mine are well aware of college (my dad worked at least 40 hours a week while in college) and the benefits of making smart decisions. Procrastination will kill you when it creeps up.

c. part 2.) Internships. I can't stress this enough. If you want to be employed out of college quickly and efficiently, internships are great for this alone. Many people from where I am will hire college students directly out of college just for showing efficiency in a work environment based setting. Not only that, you will gain valuable experience which might help you in the future workplace!

d.) Smart spending. I'm not one to advocate over expenditures, but steam has, well, affected all of our wallets over the years. Don't spend on something unless you need it, with the occasional want if it is responsible. Before spending on something ask yourself: ""do I need this?"" or ""can I make do without it?"" In fact, I advocate keeping a budget. When you take in money from a work, donate most of it to etc (what needs to be paid) and a smaller portion to what you want. Then when something comes around that you really want you have a prepared fund for just that.

e.) Clothing and growth. This partially fits into my earlier point about ""being monetarily responsible."" Don't buy over excessive amounts of a grade clothing. I'm not saying avoid nice clothing all together, of course. I'm just saying you don't need Polo brand shirts to sleep in every night. Walmart may save you a quick buck when it gives you clothing you are not seen in. Lastly, do not buy clothing if you have plenty that fits already. 

f.) Remaining well rested. If you aren't well rested from cramming all night for an exam, it can seriously affect how you perform in a lecture settings or even how you interact with others. If you can, at least 6 hours a night is great. Just keep in mind that this might not even be possible most nights. It's tough to remain rested as well as keeping on time for classes, but a healthy night's sleep will do wonders for both.

g.) Don't be afraid to try new things. Loneliness and homesickness is killer in college, new clubs and activities will allow you to meet new people (including romantic interests). It's a great feeling to be involved in something that is not only bigger than yourself, but something that will also be life enriching for yourself. As mentioned in my last post, you will even possibly gain exercise which is difficult to get when you are busy around the clock.

h.) Don't cut class, no matter how easy the subject is. Always remember, what you do in college, knowledge is power and will only strengthen your career. ""Ya snooze, ya looze.""

i.) Don't over party, bro. I can't name how many people have dropped out from this because they couldn't handle it. Not saying it happens to everyone, but it can put you in a bad situation if you let it rule your life. make sure you keep a good balance between both a social life and keeping good grades.

h.) DON'T BE WORRIED. College is not something to be worried for, as long as you are well prepared. Everyone is affected differently by it; some blossom, others don't. As long as you are well aware of these things, you will meet success 100% of the time.

And finally, my most important advice of all...

i.) Be true to yourself. Again, might seem cliche, but stick to your morals. Not to harp on groups known for hazing or other activities, but peer pressure can seriously affect your life in a negative way. No matter what your ""friends"" tell you to do, if it is wrong don't do it. You might have heard the phrase ""but this isn't harmful to me;"" to that I add an anecdote: ""but will it harm me, my future or my friendships?

"&gt; *i probably view some of your ideas as evil and insane but I won't say that because it doesn't change minds or contribute to debate.*

First, don't be a chicken shit.  I called your idea here evil and explained exactly why, because I think honesty is the only way to contribute to debate, and if my response upsets you to the point where it's counterproductive, then dancing around your delicate feelings can only indulge them and perpetuate the weakness that you need to overcome, until you can actually handle participating in a debate where people can say honest things, even if they are harsh.  I think your argument here is evil.  Grow the hell up and deal with that, and do me the courtesy of telling me when you think my ideas are evil, and explaining exactly why.

Furthermore, you're associating people calling things evil with shitty old religious bigotry of days gone by.  People would say ""that's evil"", but then either not explain, or else would claim it was evil because some magic ""god"" rule.  Which was pure bullshit.  And that is not what I did here AT ALL.  In fact I bothered to engage you because I think we actually share the same underlying values, such as wanting to promote equal opportunity for all people, but I think you are desperately confused about how that works, to the point where your proposals constitute a grave violation of other values I'm sure we both share.  And I summarize that as EVIL to get your attention about how profoundly serious I think this is.

&gt; *That is genetics, we can't control genetics yet.*

Does that mean when we can control genetics, you would make people uglier, stupider, and/or weaker, in order to prevent them from having unequal opportunities over those less fortunate?

I'm not conflating wealth with genetics, I'm comparing it, and saying it's just as evil as messing with genetics.

And exactly what is your justification for claiming you have the right to control wealth from being inherited?  You need to fully justify the proportionality of this claim, that the harm done to those you prevent from inheriting, would be somehow sufficiently offset by increasing the opportunity of others (merely crippling some in a futile attempt to create pure equal outcomes is not justifiable, you need real gains for the losers).  One way I could see doing that is to put a maximum limit on inheritance, say max $50M, which is at least such a high number that you can't stick the accusation of leaving the person excessively deprived, because that kind of money is the factual opposite of being deprived of anything.  But that limit still prevents the unearned billionaires who carry on family dynasties without actually earning the power through merit.

It would not be remotley justifiable if was just one person. But one of the harsh truths about china is their groupthink collectivist nature. They know they are subjected to propaganda. They know their laws are unjust. They know their leaders are malevolent. They know all of this and yet they support the ccp anyway because majority rules and thats all that matters. What works is the right way to do things over there. Ends and means dont come into question the same way. The same behavior pours into chinese culture as well. If one thing works, then everyone does it and it floods the market.  Thats insane but also fine because markets self correct enough to move people to alternatives. But when the government is the subject there is no room for competition, they allow absolute power to the ccp and since theres nothing else combatting it, it just get more saturated with reckless policy yet nothing can stop it because it has the power to write off failures with a snap. The ccp controls big business, media, banking, financial policy, money printing, the miitary, social hierarchy ect. If their economy fails they can literally print more money off the books largely circumventing inflation and bail it out as if nothing ever happened. They then turn their secretly worthless currency into dollars, euros ect via manufacturing. This is why they need to control hong kongs ports and will stop at nothing to get it.

Nuking china is about to be as justifiable as nuking japan was if they dont start to show any signs of change. Every variable weighed then is just magnified now. It wasnt a benevolent play in the short term but the japanese made it clear that they would not stop supporting their government and their government would not stop.

It was racist and insane, but he was written off as a clown, a bitter little man who didn’t know an American could have a name like Barack Obama. Then he called Mexicans “rapists” during the speech announcing his candidacy. He called Elizabeth Warren “Pocahontas.” Then he brought Steve Bannon into the White House with him; worked to take away voting rights from black people; and hammered away at the idea that Chicago was a wasteland because of the violent black people living there. And now, white supremacists and American Nazis are visible and energetic and demonstrative in a way we have not seen in our lifetimes.

&gt; Donald Trump did not immediately denounce the white supremacist movement when given the chance. And now, whether he knows it or not, many of those people see him as leading that movement. The leader of our country is called the president because he’s supposed to preside over our society. His job is to lead, to cajole, to scold, to correct our path, to lift up what is good about us and to absolutely and unequivocally and immediately condemn what is evil in us. And if he does not do that, if he does not preside over our society, then he is not a president.

"I drive more than most, and when I was younger I used to do the typical stupid shit including going at speeds well over 150 km/h. Top speed I've been at was 250 km/h, incredibly stupid and insane but I was to stuck up with the, it's not so bad attitude.

Doing 150 km/h on the 401 may not be unsafe . . . until you have something go wrong on your car, some other car, you fuck up, or someone else fucks up. Then it's all over but the burial's, but hey it save your a few minutes of your day right? Last year, doing 60 km/h I had a very small yet integral part of my steering system break, a simple ball joint. Thankfully I managed to control the car enough to put it across someones lawn and not into on coming traffic. At 150 km/h, I would sure as hell of hit something and most likely have been killed, even at 100 km/h I would have been in a very big pile of shit.

I skydive, I fall faster than most cars can move, and those speeds, 200 km/h, don't seem ""dangerous"" or ""scary"" to me, but I know that they are not to be toyed with. In under 5 seconds you travel one km, that means in less than you reaction time you travel 300 m, can you visualize 200 m ahead all the time driving? On the experience end of skydiving some people will be coming in under canopy at 100 km/h and you need to calculate your movements 80-100 feet ahead of time or you will react to slow.

The average eye to hand reaction time is 3/4 of a second if you are prepared, this number sky rockets if you are not. This is why in drivers-ed they beat you to death with the 4 second gap rule because it also takes a large fraction of a second to translate your reaction to your car's input.

Just to further add to it, hitting a barrier at 100 km/h there is roughly 100 g's exerted onto your body, at this amount of pressure you have a 50/50 chance of surviving just the force of the vehicle stopping, death usually occurs around 26 g but a car crash is only a very brief moment. At 200 km/h you are looking upwards of 400 g which would be instant death. 150 km/h sits in the middle, you do the math.

But I've said what I will, if you wish to travel at insanely high speeds because you don't understand the kinetic energy you're are carrying and how slow your reaction time really is, by all means put yourself and others at risk, hopefully you will get caught before hand and lose your license.","top speed i've been at was 250 km/h, incredibly stupid and insane but i was to stuck up with the, it's not so bad attitude.","stupid and insane","insane","but",FALSE,"incredibly stupid and insane","stupid",NA,"incredibly",0,"reddit",-0.50517,"thick_non-moral_concepts_NEG","negative",NA,NA,"thick_non-moral_concepts"
"Most historical figures wouldn't have the know how to be useful in this situation. The modern world is just so complex and fundamentally different than the world was just a century ago that going back any distance is just going to be useless.

I suppose it would be cheating to pick Donald Trump?

I'm going to be picking people who are MOSTLY (edit) currently alive because as I said other people won't really be very useful.

Ok so first I go with Gary McKinnon and Kevin Mitnick. They are both Hackers who have managed to crack DoD and Pentagon systems.

Ted Kaczynski, insane but highly intelligent with the ability to vreate sophisticated explosives using materials that can be relatively easily acquired.

Julian Assange; this is sort of a Hail Mary. If he actually has some of the data he supposedly has he will be incredibly useful. If he's mostly a bullshit gasbag then this pick is mostly wasted, but I think it's worth a try. Worst case scenario I can use him as some form of red herring distraction.

Chris Kyle, because this will involve a lot of assassinations. Additionally, he has the ability to train my guerillas in useful skills.

Now here is one that I'm not sure if he works within the rules: Rupert Murdoch. If I can take him and get access to his media empire, I can use it for propaganda, spreading information that is destabilizing to the government and for disinformation when necessary.

So basically this is a slow burn with flashpoints along the way and a big bang at the end. My hackers do their best to destabilize various computer infrastructure points while also getting me intel and placing various inactive viruses in as many critical systems as possible. The hackers also interview my guerillas and any with useful skills are taken to be trained by them. I use the data Assange can provide me to blackmail as many government officials as I can and to destroy others by just dumping data. Murdoch's media empire is used to spread all sorts of false information regarding what is going on while simultaneously reporting true info I deem to be destabilizing. Kyle and Kaczynski, aided by the guerillas, embark on a campaign of assassination of meaningful individuals.

"Yeah, the sad truth is that the only difficulty scaling without mods just involves enemy damage and HP, which becomes ridiculous on Master and more so on Legendary. 

This is exactly why, to me, playing on Expert is the “Goldilocks zone” where combat is tense and exciting but not a damn chore without weapons smithed and enchanted so much they make Mjolnir look like a rusty mallet and armor that makes you a literal demigod. 

But if your heart is set on beating the game on Legendary, I agree the only sane way to do it is to go all-in on alchemy, enchanting, and if you’re not a pure mage, smithing.  Enchanting has broken the game for me in the past, to where even on Legendary I killed Miraak in like 2 hits, revenant and ancient dragons died in one hit, and I could go AFK and make a sandwich in the middle of a fight with 3 arch conjurers, no follower, and not come anywhere close to dying after 15 minutes of tanking their damage.  That is what made me give up power leveling.  

I still use the crafting skills and level them up, but without doing any deliberate exploit-esque stuff like the fortify resto loop, smithing/enchanting a million iron daggers, etc.  Without doing those things, you’re forced to use your perk points for things like increasing armor rating, reducing magica burn, improving your sneaking ability, weapon damage output, etc. 

In my current playthrough, I just finished the Civil War questline at around level 32, played as Imperial this time.  The battle of Windhelm was very challenging without OP gear, but it made me play smart, use actual tactics.  Fighting through those narrow streets against Stomies swinging war hammers that could kill me in 3 hits while their archers whittled away my health was difficult but felt very rewarding to get through.  I died quickly if I over-extended or got surrounded.  It was insane, but more satisfying than in previous playthroughs when I just steamrolled through Windhelm or Solitude.

They're just two more broken people in the ruins of the world. That's the beauty of the fallout series- it shows humanity. Not an idealistic falsehood, and not a brutal vision, but something in-between. The raiders are driven to evil because of desperation, and insanity because of drugs. The average citizen doesn't care about ancient technology or what not, only about having food and clean water and a bed to sleep in. The various factions want to bring order to a chaotic place, and it's ultimately the player's choice who wins, and which ideology succeeds.

That is why I loved New Vegas the best- the factions were so *human*. House is an old man trying to preserve the spirit of his home through any means necessary, the NCR is trying to spread their prosperity and order to New Vegas, the Legion seeks to dominate the area for new slaves and resources, and an independent Vegas is ultimately ruled by the player for better or for worse.

The Fiends are born drug addicts, they can't help but be violent and insane, but they still banish anyone who falls too deeply into addiction. The Boomers are xenophobic, and will often accidentally let their prejudice show, but still are willing to trust you if you prove yourself. The Brotherhood is... pretty much the same. The Followers seek to heal the world one person at a time. The Khans just want to have some place to call their own.

"The exotic matter is just a placeholder for 'a thing that can manipulate gravity'. Manipulation of gravity at the same level we can manipulate electromagnetism is beyond our grasp currently but we also don't fully understand gravity yet so it may be possible in the future.

But it still takes a lot of energy to bend spacetime. Mass (which via E=mc^2 we know is extremely concentrated energy) bends spacetime by its very precense though not by much. Whatever mechanism will require a crazy amount of energy. I think early calculations called for jupiter sized amounts of antimatter. Later calculations scaled that down to a still insane but more possible 4 tons of antimatter. I would assume the mechanism would require constant energy to maintain its spacetime manipulation. 

If the warp bubble is stable by itself then maybe it would be hard to disengage it but that seems unlikely that it wouldn't collapse without some energy to keep it stable.

“the writer Ti-Grace Atkinson and the lawyer Flo Kennedy, formed the bedrock of radical feminism and presented Solanas as a symbol of female rage.”

"Because murder is a natural part of the human condition. Monkeys have been shown to have a similar incidence rate of murder compared to humans. Killing is natural, as it is what we do as a species. That is why we have laws prohibiting it in order to live a human society. 

The poster above is assuming an eliminative materialist position. Brain scans cannot assume mental states. They don’t diagnose psychiatric disorders or some neurological ones. In medical terms, it is not pathognomic. It does not rule in or rules out a psychiatric disorder like schizophrenia. The use of fMRI to detect brains of killers is correlational at best. If used it court it will not by itself be enough to sustain an insanity defense. Not definitively.

 The insanity defense has a long history, especially in the western world. The insanity defense (varies by state and country), but in the US it has two statues (mostly). 

A. One that the person has a mental defect or disorder. 

B. Second that the mental defect or disorder was ACTIVE during the actions of the crime. 

Other states have statues like  “substantial capacity to appreciate the criminality of \[their\] conduct"" that is an extremely high bar to reach, which is beyond the scope of this reply. The insanity defense is used only by the defense, as it is up the defense attorney to prove those above statues. 

Now let's see how murderers are not insane. Insanity is a legal term, not a medical one. To find someone insane that is to find someone fulfilling the statues above. Insanity can be found by doing an intensive IME (independent medical evaluation). This consists of psychological testing, medical record review, and a psychiatric interview (etc.). This can be done by either a psychologist or a psychiatrist. IME's are a long and rigorous process that can take days. Plus, your report will be attacked by the opposing attorney and other forensic experts/expert witnesses. Thus, if a person does not meet the insanity defense they are not insane, but are guilty of XYZ. 

Now more information about the American legal system. One can be found guilty of a crime, not guilty, not guilty due to insanity (NGRI), not not guilty (aka unfit to stand trial, extremely sick), or guilty but insane or mentally ill"".  Guilty is when a person is found guilty of breaking a law or committing a crime. NGRI is when a person fulfills the statues above for the insanity defense. Not Not guilty as a person is unable or unfit to stand trial. They are so sick they cannot understand the charges against them and are set to a psychiatric hospital for treatment until they are fit for trial or other circumstances. Guilty but mentally ill or insane (depending on the wording of a statue) is the judge or a jury recognizing that mental illness played a rule in the act of the crime, but the person is still guilty because it did not meet the above insanity statues for finding someone NGRI.

It was racist and insane, but he was written off as a clown, a bitter little man who didn’t know an American could have a name like Barack Obama. Then he called Mexicans “rapists” during the speech announcing his candidacy. He called Elizabeth Warren “Pocahontas.” Then he brought Steve Bannon into the White House with him; worked to take away voting rights from black people; and hammered away at the idea that Chicago was a wasteland because of the violent black people living there. And now, white supremacists and American Nazis are visible and energetic and demonstrative in a way we have not seen in our lifetimes.

&gt; Donald Trump did not immediately denounce the white supremacist movement when given the chance. And now, whether he knows it or not, many of those people see him as leading that movement. The leader of our country is called the president because he’s supposed to preside over our society. His job is to lead, to cajole, to scold, to correct our path, to lift up what is good about us and to absolutely and unequivocally and immediately condemn what is evil in us. And if he does not do that, if he does not preside over our society, then he is not a president.

"""If it were a matter of bourgeois ladies voting, the capitalist state could expect nothing but effective support for the reaction. Most of those bourgeois women who act like lionesses in the struggle against “male prerogatives” would trot like docile lambs in the camp of conservative and clerical reaction if they had suffrage. Indeed, they would certainly be a good deal more reactionary than the male part of their class. Aside from the few who have jobs or professions, the women of the bourgeoisie do not take part in social production. They are nothing but co-consumers of the surplus value their men extort from the proletariat. They are parasites of the parasites of the social body. And consumers are usually even more rabid and cruel in defending their “right” to a parasite’s life than the direct agents of class rule and exploitation. The history of all great revolutionary struggles confirms this in a horrible way. Take the great French Revolution. After the fall of the Jacobins, when Robespierre was driven in chains to the place of execution the naked whores of the victory-drunk bourgeoisie danced in the streets, danced a shameless dance of joy around the fallen hero of the Revolution. And in 1871, in Paris, when the heroic workers’ Commune was defeated by machine guns, the raving bourgeois females surpassed even their bestial men in their bloody revenge against the suppressed proletariat. The women of the property-owning classes will always fanatically defend the exploitation and enslavement of the working people by which they indirectly receive the means for their socially useless existence.

Economically and socially, the women of the exploiting classes are not an independent segment of the population.. Their only social function is to be tools of the natural propagation of the ruling classes. By contrast, the women of the proletariat are economically independent. They are productive for society like the men. By this I do not mean their bringing up children or their housework which helps men support their families on scanty wages. This kind of work is not productive in the sense of the present capitalist economy no matter how enormous an achievement the sacrifices and energy spent, the thousand little efforts add up to. This is but the private affair of the worker, his happiness and blessing, and for this reason nonexistent for our present society. As long as capitalism and the wage system rule, only that kind of work is considered productive which produces surplus value, which creates capitalist profit. From this point of view, the music-hall dancer whose legs sweep profit into her employer’s pocket is a productive worker, whereas all the toil of the proletarian women and mothers in the four walls of their homes is considered unproductive. This sounds brutal and insane, but corresponds exactly to the brutality and insanity of our present capitalist economy.

"This is the same guy that is a communist which does not hold up to logic, whatsoever, yet, continues to believe in it.

Nothing against this quote, I'm just really not a huge fan of the Dalai Lama and while I may be alone in this, I think he does a poor job representing Buddhism especially with a communist belief system.

http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5iuVJiiZyLI36IqXtW4cUaj0bDGYQ

His understanding of Capitalism is very weak but Liberal minded which, again, is void of most logic. Capitalism is not about making money, it's about earning. Being compensated isn't a horrible concept. More realistically, it's about trade - I trade you tooth paste for sucks - ya, really evil (unless we Cherry Pick some rich guy but even then).

Working for free doesn't work or else the Soviet Union, Cuba, China, etc. would all be flourishing so he is pushing an ideology that keeps people oppressed, both physically AND mentally and quite often, spiritually, but condemns another because it's about profit? Ridiculous.

Hence, I don't follow this guy. He is playing a part that I don't believe he owns.

EDIT: I am quoting his political belief system as it is another system, much like the one Buddhism, Islam, etc. represent. I will openly challenge any Buddhist to a debate on politics and which one best fits Buddhist ideologies. For me, it's Libertarianism as that is truly free and allows people to truly be themselves (let alone discover themselves).

"The original list is 1600 points exactly. Make sure you haven’t made a mistake with the wargear options anywhere. The only way I can make that original list 1610 is by having two Crypteks with Chronometron instead of one with Chronometron and one with a Canoptek Cloak. It it’s still a problem, type out your list manually with the wargear and I’ll check it.

Just to reiterate, you do have some other small list variants you can and should consider.

1. If you take that basic list and take out one of the two squads of the 5x Destroyers and 1x Heavy Destroyer. Add in 6x Wraiths with Whip Coils. Change the Overlord’s weapon to a Voidscythe. That’s 1598 points.

2. Take that same basic list again, and take out one of the two squads of the 5x Destroyers and 1x Heavy Destroyer. Add in 6x Wraiths with no wargear. Give your Overlord a Voidblade (or Hyperphase Sword) and a Resurrection Orb. Add an extra Gauss Immortal to the squad of 5x to make it 6x. That’s 1599 (or 1598) points.

My understanding is that Maynarkh has to borrow a dynastic code from other dynasties for the sake of rules and play. The reroll hit rolls of 1 is taken from Nihilakh. Taking Nihilakh (or Maynarkh using the Nihilakh dynastic code) for that dynastic code is also a fine option and one I should have considered originally. All I’ll say is that it might encourage you to be very static and you could end up losing objectives and have the opponent score tonnes of VP. It depends on the game type you’re playing, really. If you’re playing a defensive game, take Nihilakh for sure.

The Tesla Castle is likely to be static in most games, but not necessarily. I think the flexibility offered by Nephrekh for advancing might be better in some games, but not that useful in others. In other words, you will see a benefit from the Nihilakh dynastic code, but I’m not saying it’s the best universal choice. As you say, it will work really well with DDAs. It doesn’t work twice with Destroyers because you can only reroll a dice once. You cannot reroll a reroll. By the way, a roll of 1 does not become a 2 with MWBD. A roll of 1 is always a fail. So, the Nihilakh dynastic code will help your castle a bit because they can reroll those 1s. 

All in all, you just have to consider if it’s worth picking Nihilakh over Sautekh or Nephrekh. There are great reasons to take all of them. You would only take Maynarkh if you wanted to take one or both of the named characters.

I’m sure this would have been discussed on loads of other threads, but I’ll give my quick two cents here. In terms named characters, they’re a bit pricey, especially vis-a-vis their non-named character counterparts. I’ll start with the Maynarkh ones, then I’ll talk about Imotekh.
+ Kutlakh the World Killer comes in at 200 points vs 80 points for an Overlord with Staff of Light. He’s even 60 points more than Imotekh (who I’ll talk about below), who’s 140 points. If you look at his stats, he’s the same as a regular Overlord, but with one extra wound, and a 2+ instead of 4+ armour save (both have the 4+ invun). Cool that he gets a Phylactery. Death Incarnate is siiiiiiiiiiick until you realise it only affects -infantry-. Splinter of Madness looks pretty decent. The Obsidiax weapon is literally just a Hyperphase Sword with one less strength (Hyperphase Sword gives you +1, so base S5 +1 = 6) and D3 damage instead of a flat 1. Hmmm. He’s obviously designed for melee and for use in a melee heavy army. Again, assaultcrons lists usually don’t work. His rules suggest you run him with Lychguard or Flayed Ones because they’re the only assault &lt;Dynasty&gt; -infantry- we have, but they both suck. He’s just very expensive on the whole and not going to work in the list I outlined.
+ Toholk the Blinded is basically a gimmicky Crytpek with Chronometron who gets the vehicle repair of the Canoptek Cloak (called ‘Eternal Engines’ for him)but without the extra movement. He gets an extra 1 toughness, and an extra melee attack, which are negligible. His weapons are decent, not insane, but weird. His Aeonstave is strictly better than the Staff of Light in melee, and the Transdimensional Beamer is generally better than the Staff of Light in shooting. They’re both a bit gimmicky. His Predictive Strategist rule is gimmicky, too, but kind of cool. All in all, he’s 30 points more than a Cryptek with Chronometron, and 40 more than a Cryptek with a Canoptek Cloak for mostly gimmicky bonuses, although the vehicle repair from Eternal Engines and Chronometron 5+ invun bubble bundled into one model is very good for your static castle, especially if your DDAs are close. I don’t know if you can afford 30-40 points for gimmicks at the 1500/1600 points cost, but by all means try him out because his Chronometron and Eternal Engines rules make him decent, as I say. 
+ Imotekh is obviously really good, especially for the original list I propose, and especially because I argued for Sautekh. He’s 60 points more than a regular Overlord with a Staff of Light, but for those 60 points, you get so so so much. I’m stupid for not considering him in the first place, so thanks for pointing him out. I don’t need to run down everything with him like the other characters. He’s obviously just a beast. The question is fitting him in at the points cost. Referring back to my original list, I’d think about dropping a the Overlord (who he’ll replace), a Heavy Destroyer from your non-VoD target squad, a Scarab Swarm Base (so now you have 5 instead of 6), and changing the Cryptek with Canoptek Cloak for a Lord with a Staff of Light. That brings you to 1597 points. That Lord is super negligible, but is the only fit for the points cost. I wouldn’t shave points anywhere else to get a better HQ than the Lord. Our characters are overcosted and not all that good. Only concern is if he gets rereleased in plastic, or a new sculpt entirely, what with the rumours (!) of a new edition / Necron reboot later this year (maybe around late autumn at earliest, if true).

—

Okay, finally onto your question about Scarabs and squad sizes. Honestly, play whatever your terrain demands. If you need to block off two passageways in terrain, then take two squads of three (assuming you have six) if they can actually block the two passageways. It’s all about the terrain and how your castle is positioned on the board, I would argue.

"/r/Baccano mod here...unfortunately doing what I did two days ago, which is to write a comment for this episode on the same day the next episode (12.5 in this case) is due to go up. Welp.

I'm not keen on spending the same amount of time on this comment as I did Episode 11's, so I'm going to try to keep this on the shorter side (and I imagine some will be relieved, heh). 

I believe the confrontation between Seiji, Mika, Celty, and Mikado didn't happen out in the open space of the square like it seems to do here. 

In the novel, Celty and Mikado hide in the shadows of an alleyway near the square to avoid being picked up by the police. (Since Mikado is wearing his school jacket in the LN, he's worried that will definitely identify him/lead to punishment). None of the passersby snitch to the police, and the police leave.

Once they do, Celty walks back to the van where ""her head [is] sitting"" aka the amnesiac girl (Mika) -- and Seiji stabs her in the back unexpectedly, as opposed to her taking the blade purposefully in Mikado's stead. Seiji hops into the van, with none of the watching Van Gang trying to stop him, and pulls Mika out of the van: ""I've come for you. Let's go.""

And Mika agrees. All (except Izaya) are in varying degrees of shock. Seiji tells Mikado that he (Seiji) owes a lot to Mikado and Namie; Mikado starts to ask if Seiji really killed someone, Seiji says he ""might"" have, and he cites the power of love. The others surround him, he compares Mikado to a ""third-rate villain"" and assumes Mikado has never been in love; he swings the scalpel downward...

..At which point Celty swings down with her blade, which he dodges. Ultimately Mika does step in front of the scythe's path and scream, ""Stop!"" The clips shown of Mika outside Seiji's door are taken from the Prologue, which if you remember is where the scene with Seiji by (Mika's) body also came from.

Seiji having failed to recognize Mika's 'head' was not the real ting... *ouch*.

""You're definitely not a stalker"" / Mikado just because you say she wasn't acting out of selfishness doesn't mean her actions weren't stalker-y...

Shinra, you selfish little... \*cue unkind grumblings*.

From the novel:

&gt; “I’m not going to say that I’ll give up if that’s truly what will make you happy. This is a battle of your love against mine. Remember what I said? I will spare no effort in seizing victory in our game of fate. So that poor girl—Mika, her name was? I used her in an attempt to make you give up on your head. I’m not going to let you go. I will use the love of others, their deaths, my own self, even your own emotions to keep you here—as contradictory as that sounds.” 

&gt; In a way, his words were extremely twisted and insane, but there was no doubt clouding his eyes. That was what broke Celty’s will. If he’d played dumb or given her some lame excuse, she would have beaten him until he couldn’t stand and left, never to return. But after such a strong, direct statement of intent, Celty had no response.

Celty's jabbed/poked at Shinra before, but the punch she gives him here is... Well, there's some real serious emotion that led up to that punch, and Shinra's non-punch back seriously does not excuse the crap he's pulled. Oooh, you sneaky, no-good...

Mika leading a stunned Seiji around...that boy sure had a nasty shock, huh. Teenagers. I swear.

&gt; Kadota and Izaya meet, old high school classmates that they are

&gt; Izaya immediately calls him his hated nickname Dotachin

&gt; Erika calls him Dotachin

Poor Kadota just can't catch a break. I *think* the scene where he speaks with Izaya (in person for the first time in ages) + the Izaya-Mikado conversation is meant to happen *before* the Seiji-Mika reveal...

...Eh, what's more important is highlighting what Izaya remarked to Mikado:

&gt; “But while you may be dreaming of a life outside the bounds of normality, life in Tokyo will become normal after you’ve been here for a year. If you still want the abnormal, you’ll need to either move somewhere else or get into drugs, prostitution, or whatever lies even deeper underground.""

&gt; [...] “Life becomes normal even for the people on the other side of the tracks. Take the plunge for yourself, and you’ll be used to it in three days. And people like you can never bear that. ...If you truly want to escape the ordinary, you’ll simply need to keep evolving—whether what you seek is above or below.”

(From the YP translation).

*That* is definitely something to remember for the coming episodes/seasons.

Anyway... Shizuo doesn't show up and do his ""Iiiizaaayaaa"" routine here in the LNs. Mikado simply bows as Izaya leaves; Izaya turns around, says he's been wanting to glimpse the person who created something ""as dumb as"" the Dollars, and does the ""Hang in there, Tarou Tanaka!"" namedrop as he walks off. 

I think this isn't the only time the anime's decided to throw in extra Shizuo-Izaya rivalry scenes/amp it up, I but don't quote me on that. It's *probably* safe to say they really like capitalizing on it.

**Seiji:** I don't love you, but I guess you're a reminder of my love/dedication toward the real deal, soooo okay sure, I'll accept your love until I get her back. then it's quits, sweet cheeks

**Mika:** I was born ready and have no problems with this arrangement. [She thinks this next bit in the volume, but the anime cuts out her reply so I think they're saving this specific sentiment for the future](/s ""in the meantime I will sacrifice everything for you and do whatever it takes to help you find the real head. You know, so I can eat it and become it. for your sake."")

&gt; A love between them that would last until the moment their true love came true. 

&gt; A love that was so straightforward and so terribly twisted.

&gt; The sight of them was so delicate and precious--and so horribly, horribly wrong. 

(From the LN). Yeah honestly Narita that might be a bit of an understatement....

This episode explicitly confirms TarouTanaka = Mikado and Setton = Celty for the viewers who didn't fully appreciate either up to this point. 

Mikado is surprised to see Seiji and Mika attending classes, but between the two he's more surprised that Mika's showed up. Also, I think she's meant to have a bandage around her neck (rather than blatantly exposing the scar to the school)...

I might repeat this factoid later since I'm not sure how many people will return to this episode thread, but: Raira Academy *does* permit students to wear casual clothes, which is while Mika can get away with her attire here... 

...However, although most people are wearing the Raira uniform in the anime, in the novels its actually people who *wear* the uniforms who stand out (e.g. Mikado and Anri). 

&gt; There's that merger with Nebula

As if I were *not* going to call out every mention of Nebula... In this case, Yagiri Pharmaceuticals *and* Nebula have been observing the incidents surrounding [Namie's/Yagiri's] research lab for the past several days, so they've been wanting to finish the merger deal before any more 'nonsense' goes down. 

And Nebula wants ""the dullahan's head,"" of course... But Namie will give the head to them before hell freezes over, so she's fled Yagiri in search of somewhere she can hide the head and have some measure of control over where it might be. 

Izaya, it seems, is her only choice. One of desperation, really. 

Izaya in the LN: *""I think your uncle was a lot like me. He believed in the afterlife less than anyone else. He feared death more than anyone else. And he craved heaven more than anyone else.""

...I told myself this wouldn't be as long as the Episode 11 comment, and look at me now... bleh. I think it didn't take as long to write as Episode 11's comment did, so that's something at least...?! 

With that said, it's 1 PM so there's less than 3 hours until the next episode thread, so I might skip Fanart Corner for this episode (sorry). In any case, we've pretty much wrapped up the first volume with the closing off this arc (the Dollars/Mika Harima arc), so prepare for new shenanigans in the second half...","i will use the love of others, their deaths, my own self, even your own emotions to keep you here—as contradictory as that sounds.”   &gt; in a way, his words were extremely twisted and insane, but there was no doubt clouding his eyes.","twisted and insane","insane","but",FALSE,"extremely twisted and insane","twisted",NA,"extremely",0,"reddit",0.12208,"thick_non-moral_concepts_NEG","negative",NA,NA,"thick_non-moral_concepts"

"I am interested in the bug that crawls into the Lost Sinner's mask at the start of the fight. The bug seems to make the Sinner quite upset which is notable because we have seen this at least once before in Dark Souls.

I have in the past had a thought that there may be something interesting to say about the Sunlight Maggot's existence. Solaire spends all of Dark Souls 1 searching for his sun and I think that, in the end, he gets exactly what he is searching for. He finds just what he has lost. The Chaos bug that drops the Sunlight Maggot is distinctive for its glowing red eyes and of course its drop. I don't know if there's a ton of basis for this, but I think its possible that, right before losing his deity-status, Solaire as the God of War hid a fragment of his power somewhere quiet and remote in the hopes that he may be drawn to find and regain it in his new life. In his new existence as a human, he may not have his memories but he may hope to have inclinations and deep-held desires that will lead him back to his sun, his power. After losing his status, as we know, he sets out on a course of action-- he is drawn to become undead, walk the lands of Lordran in search of his sun and, if he doesn't find what he is looking for, assist in killing Gwyn. If he does find his sun, he goes insane (perhaps a fail-safe from Gywn to keep him from regaining his status? Perhaps his now undead body just cant handle his old power and it makes him insane), insane but delighted because he has completed his quest- finding his sun was all he'd ever hoped for in his new life. (Obviously just my personal speculation!! :) )

Can we apply this same theory to the Lost Sinner and to the Witch of Izalith in some way?

Title: **Roommate assaulted me and got away with it**

Original Post: 

&gt; My roommate just tried strangling me because I was walking around the house without a shirt (he's religious and insane), but when I called the cops, he called them too and said I assaulted him first.
&gt; 
&gt; The cops told me that because it's a ""he said, she said"" scenario, the most likely outcome if I don't drop the charges is that both of us will end up with assault charges on our record, so I didn't file charges.
&gt; 
&gt; This guy is a vile, racist, ignorant, manipulative sneak, but the landlord likes him because he does a lot of landscaping for free. Any suggestions?

Demanding a constant connection while playing has screwed me over many times, personally. Games For Windows Live doesn't allow you to save if you aren't connected to the net, and guess what happened when I found I didn't have a connection? A few hours I needed to replay.

By the way, you know Origin? That not only requires a connection, it also requires allowing EA to scan your hard drive and access your net history, and build up a personal profile on you to sell to third parties. By the way, it says nothing about giving anonymity when they do so, too (yes, I'm serious, it's insane but true).

Apparently Origin will be required to play all EA games released henceforth, even if you buy retail. So, do you want to play Mass Effect 3, with a mouse? There goes your privacy. Or you could pirate, I suppose.

Is ***that*** enough to justify getting a lower score? Maybe you don't care about privacy (not to say you don't), but some people don't care about graphical glitches, should the games be rated without factoring in those glitches?

"wow...shes a bitch.

it sounds to me like she got to you at a very young age and really made you feel worthless at times.  even if you understand what what she said was stupid and insane, its sometimes still hard to shake the feeling if she was able to get to you at a young age (under 20).  

the reason she is like this is (most likely) because someone did it to her.  she has insecurities about who she is and feels like a failure.  i know that hearing that probably doesn't suddenly make you feel better (or maybe it does), but i feel like it helps to understand why people treated you the way they did.  it isn't normally your fault.

my best advice to you is to continue to try and do good in school, but put your happiness first.  in my opinion, thats all that really matters.   now, dont fool this for ""be irresponsible.""  sometimes, putting up with crap (like a job you dont like) helps do things like pay for rent, food, movies, etc etc.  be happy, but keep the future in mind.  work hard towards things YOU want. 

but dont beat yourself up over failures.  for example, im terrible at history and i didnt get a single A through university on history (of which i was required to take 5 miserable classes).  i even failed one (i blame the fact that the teacher was totally insane...not like laugh at her insane, but she would laugh even when it didnt make sense and everyone was terrified of her; like seriously fucking detached from reality insane).  was that my fault?  i really dont feel guilty.  i wish i hadnt taken the class ever, but if i could go back, things would probably be the same.

sorry, difted off, my point was: you are human.  humans make mistakes.  if you focus on ""man, i messed up, i wish that hadnt happened, things would be so much better if that hadnt happened""... change your thoughts more towards ""how can i learn from this?  if i could go back in time, would i do it again?""  accept who you are and focus on improving who you already are.  if you focus on who you want to be, youll forget to look at yourself in your current state sometimes.

to give another example from my life, i just bought a ""special edition"" of a video game recently for a lot of money.  after opening it and seeing whats inside that made it so ""special"" i really kind of feel like i wasted my money.  BUT, on the other hand, im supporting a group of game developers that i really like.  i like being able to play their games and what to support them anyway i can.  so even if the material value wasn't worth it, ive logiced my way into feeling like it was worth it.

Airbnbs may not be getting penalized because no one is enforcing the by-laws, but no one is renting them anyways because every major festival and sporting event has been cancelled.

"The gamepad is useable with everything. For other controllers, consult Google first depending on the game. 

*Bayonetta + Bayonetta 2 (Do you like action games? Do you like Devil May Cry? You NEED to get these, Bayonetta 1 is at its best on Wii U and Bayonetta 2 is an exclusive AND they come together!)

*Hyrule Warriors [Dynasty Warriors + Zelda, HUGE amounts of content, if you don't know anything about Musou games you're basically a powerful leader unit (Zelda, Link, Impa, Wizzrobe and other well known characters) that smashes around hordes of bad guy soldiers and duels with enemy ""officers"" (other important characters) look up musou games and if you think they're your thing, definitely get this]

*The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker HD (If you've never played the original this is worth the investment, the Wind Waker is an amazing iteration in the Legend of Zelda series that has you exploring the great ocean, a new concept that I think was executed very well)

*Mario Kart 8 (Best Mario Kart to date, has the best example of DLC in recent memory, only 1 criticism and that is that the battle mode is sort of meh, it's basically just regular stages with the battle element, there are no ""arenas"", however this is a phenomenal game that over 50% of Wii U owners have, the online is robust and very active, can't recommend it enough really)

*Pikmin 3 (The best RTS series off of PC gaming, nuff said if you don't know about Pikmin, look into the first two!)

*Splatoon (One of the games of the year. This game is fantastic, it's a competitive shooter but if you're not the competitive type don't feel too worried, it's a blast for more casual players and highly skilled ones. You don't need to worry if your aim isn't so good because you can bring value to your team just by painting the stage! I cannot recommend this game enough, it's so unique and there aren't really other games like it at the moment)

*Super Mario Maker (Amazing concept, very vibrant community. I will say that there are many levels that are painful to play because of how easy it is to upload them but don't be discouraged! The game allows you to skip them when doing the random-level 100 Mario Mode and you never have to complete a level that is painful, if you're the creative type this game has all kinds of ways of flexing that and its getting updates to its content going forward)

*Super Smash Bros. (Nintendo's take on fighting games, well established, very controversial at times. There's not much I can say, if you're not familiar with Smash this is a great way to get into it, best with other friends but has online play)

*The Wonderful 101 (Underrated game, it's challenging to break into because of the control method, but if you want an action-packed beat em' up style game that makes terrific use of the gamepad and is completely unique in execution you owe it to yourself to try it out)
https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbCOGQCF6GO0HsY1zfxStGA1Ou-7Fj6AN


*Yoshi's Woolly World (Stunning game, it's the true sequel to Yoshi's Island that people have wanted for a long time, aesthetics are great, collectables are well incorporated and the challenge is perfect and customizable)

*Art of Balance (Digital only, very simple puzzle game but I find it relaxing)

*Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze (Amazing game, if you have ever liked a Donkey Kong Country game, you have to get this, some of the best platforming experiences in years)

*New Super Mario Bros. U + New Super Luigi U (Best NSMB game, builds on the formula, very polished)

*Affordable Space Adventures (Digital only, great indie shooter style game that makes great use of the gamepad)

*Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker (You will get a taste of this game in Super Mario 3D world, the Captain Toad levels are the format for this game)

*Kirby and the Rainbow Curse (A more laid back title, nothing insane but very charming and the style of gameplay is very unique)

*NES Remix Pack (Big collection of NES games with new ""challenges"")

*Pushmo World (Fantastic puzzle game, look up Pushmo in general to learn how it works more properly)

*Fatal Frame: Oracle of the Sodden Raven (A great addition to a Japanese horror series, digital only in North America very sadly and limited physical release in Europe that likely can't be secured anymore)

*Shovel Knight (Physical version, probably the best example of a new game that successfully emulates classic NES gameplay)

******Future Titles******

*Rodea the Sky Soldier (Nov. 10)

*Xenoblade Chronicles: X (Dec. 4)

*Star Fox Zero (Q1 2016)

*Fast Racing Neo (2016)

*The Legend of Zelda U (2016?)

*Pokken Tournament (Q2 2016)

*Shin Megami Tensei X Fire Emblem (2016)

"""How about prosecuting her after the first case?""

That was the issue I was trying to address. Setting a precedent for prosecuting women who accuse a man of rape and end up losing the case (that is what is happening at this point) can easily be problematic. What happens if this person was actually raped, and the system simply failed to find this accused man guilty? Then the rape victim is now being accused of a crime herself, which is insane. But in this particular case, of course, it is easy to look at this woman who has falsely accused 8 men of rape and to call her insane and reprehensible. This is clearly an extreme case of the central problem at hand, which is what to do with those who falsely accuse people, and how to tell the different between them and those whom the legal system has failed. 

Edit: when I said ""that is what is happening at this point"" I am referring to the hypothetical first case to which you refer.","but in this particular case, of course, it is easy to look at this woman who has falsely accused 8 men of rape and to call her insane and reprehensible.","insane and reprehensible","insane","but",FALSE,"insane and reprehensible","reprehensible",NA,NA,1,"reddit",-0.12046,"thick_non-moral_concepts_NEG","negative",NA,NA,"thick_non-moral_concepts"
"""If it were a matter of bourgeois ladies voting, the capitalist state could expect nothing but effective support for the reaction. Most of those bourgeois women who act like lionesses in the struggle against “male prerogatives” would trot like docile lambs in the camp of conservative and clerical reaction if they had suffrage. Indeed, they would certainly be a good deal more reactionary than the male part of their class. Aside from the few who have jobs or professions, the women of the bourgeoisie do not take part in social production. They are nothing but co-consumers of the surplus value their men extort from the proletariat. They are parasites of the parasites of the social body. And consumers are usually even more rabid and cruel in defending their “right” to a parasite’s life than the direct agents of class rule and exploitation. The history of all great revolutionary struggles confirms this in a horrible way. Take the great French Revolution. After the fall of the Jacobins, when Robespierre was driven in chains to the place of execution the naked whores of the victory-drunk bourgeoisie danced in the streets, danced a shameless dance of joy around the fallen hero of the Revolution. And in 1871, in Paris, when the heroic workers’ Commune was defeated by machine guns, the raving bourgeois females surpassed even their bestial men in their bloody revenge against the suppressed proletariat. The women of the property-owning classes will always fanatically defend the exploitation and enslavement of the working people by which they indirectly receive the means for their socially useless existence.

Economically and socially, the women of the exploiting classes are not an independent segment of the population.. Their only social function is to be tools of the natural propagation of the ruling classes. By contrast, the women of the proletariat are economically independent. They are productive for society like the men. By this I do not mean their bringing up children or their housework which helps men support their families on scanty wages. This kind of work is not productive in the sense of the present capitalist economy no matter how enormous an achievement the sacrifices and energy spent, the thousand little efforts add up to. This is but the private affair of the worker, his happiness and blessing, and for this reason nonexistent for our present society. As long as capitalism and the wage system rule, only that kind of work is considered productive which produces surplus value, which creates capitalist profit. From this point of view, the music-hall dancer whose legs sweep profit into her employer’s pocket is a productive worker, whereas all the toil of the proletarian women and mothers in the four walls of their homes is considered unproductive. This sounds brutal and insane, but corresponds exactly to the brutality and insanity of our present capitalist economy.

"&gt; You said “imagine getting so pressed for commenting twice” but you ended up commenting twice smh...

I'm not the one who responded to a month old comment at the exact same user, you did lol. 

&gt; ... anyway there was no rhyme or reason as to separating the spirits Bryke only did it to make LOK separate from ATLA which it would always be compared too. 

I've told you the reason like 3 times now, choosing to ignore it is your problem. 

&gt; It was not yangchens fault at all she saved the human race and the promise and the north don’t try to make things tie in with LOK only the rift does when it does random crap about cabbage Corp and saying stuff like “There will never be peace as long as their is a border wink wink”

The Promise talks about Yu Dao and people of different backgrounds living together in one place, just like in TLOK. North &amp; South talks about the tension between the two tribes, which is brought up again in TLOK. Maybe read the comics you're so quick to dismiss. And it absolutely was her fault, she's supposed to be the bridge &amp; mediator between humans and spirits, and yet she took the side of humans. If it wasn't her fault then Old Iron wouldn't have come back. 

&gt; it’s just stupid and the whole avatar thing wasn’t built up whatsoever she literally used it one time and it saved her bending and allowed her to save everyone else’s bending so that only proves it could still help. 

She used it to meet the first Avatar and stop the bad guy's plans. In the second season. 

&gt; LOK contradicts ATLA in soooo many ways. 

No it doesn't, as I already showed you. 

&gt; -Aaron Ehaz said that aapa was supposed to be the last sky bison like aang was supposed to be the last Airbender of the old monks. 

Aaron Ehasz never said this and isn't the creator of the show lmao! 

&gt; -ATLA is based off of eastern culture and balance and LOK completely white washes it and makes it about western culture or “white culture” and makes it good vs evil.

Pick up a history book dude instead of listening to YouTubers who don't know what they're talking about. ATLA is based on eastern history &amp; culture that was in the process of being westernized. The Qing Dynasty, Meiji Era Japan, 1950s Tibet. By your logic, the Swampbenders, wrestlers, venetian style city of the North tribe, and the fact that the people of the water tribes are based on Native Americans &amp; Inuit/Eskimos are all based on Eastern culture. There was already good VS evil lol, the show literally ends with a good VS evil clash. 

&gt; -The lion turtle says that benders bended their energies and not the elements before the age of the avatar.

The Lion Turtle was talking about the Lion Turtles, not the people. 

&gt; -Lightning is supposed to be a rare gift which was extremely difficult to master and Iroh said himself only a select few of firebenders were able to master it regardless of how the world evolves it doesn’t just randomly get easier.

No one said it did get easier. It's not a rare gift lol, it's just a technique that requires the user to have no inner conflict, a claim by Iroh that was rendered false thanks to Azula going insane but still able to use it. 

&gt; -ATLA says blood bending is only possible in a full moon

Read up on how Bloodbending works, it's still just waterbending at the end of the day. 

&gt; -When aang went to the North Pole there definitely wasn’t a random portal their that led to the spirit realm or he would have used it to go and they said the oasis place was the center of their spiritual energy not some random portal in the woods.

But he didn't get to the actual North pole, he was in the Northern tribe. The portal is only active during the Winter Solstice, this was all explained in the show. If you bothered to watch it you'd know that lol. 

&gt; -The cycle being reset also makes no sense whatsoever because that isn’t how eastern cultures believed reincarnation worked they are still her past lives even if ravaa gets burned alive she will always be connected to them.

You don't know much about Eastern cultures then. Raava doesn't have to be around in order for reincarnation to happen, people reincarnate regardless. She can't be connected to them if her old body is destroyed, that doesn't make any sense. 

&gt; -Hama literally created blood bending herself and only ever taught it to katara.

And? Next you're going to tell me Toph created metalbending too. Katara wasn't the only one to learn of Bloodbending, that's why she banned it in the first place. 

&gt; -The most major contradiction is that ATLA is an amazing series and some how LOK was terrible it could have been so wonderful but it wasn’t it only ruined the franchise sadly.

"Imagine this. 

Therapist: provides medical quests and the quests will suddenly be worth it because instead of being able to buy IFaks you have to run a quest for them, and even when you get them up only get a few. What the Therapist is REALLY good for is post raid if you lost 300 HP and one leg and both arms are blacked out, you can spend 10K rubles and instead of having a 1 hour recovery time you have maybe a 5-10 minute one, but never instantaneous, meaning you can alternate between scav and PMC even at high levels and still have a purpose, and people will treat their scavs better because if they charge in and die, they have to wait a little while to fully recover their PMC or get a new scav. She may also still provide insurance, maybe. 

Prapor: provides insurance, and can provide you with shitty guns that are overpriced, but still cheaper than Mechanic or Peacekeeper. 

Mechanic: specialist at repairing weapons, and will trade you vital parts to a gun for optional weapon mods, as well as trade you optional mods for novelty items like the Bitcoin (obviously not the bitcoin though, because ~90k for a red dot sight is absolutely insane, but more pricey mods could still go for bitcoins) also will trade you weapons cases eventually if you do enough quests.

Skier: provides you with quicker scav runs in exchange for limiting that scav run to one or two maps. Imagine a Skier Scav that is a little more decked out, but must complete a mission in map (one that is pretty generic but will still force you to go out of your way) and you can loot while doing it. There is no penalty for killing other scavs, but if you fail the mission you must give an amount that is told to you at the beginning of the quest as ""Tribute"" before you can take your stuff. Imagine a quest where you either have to find him something like a folder with intelligence, of which there are a few spawns in a map and 1 or 2 guaranteed spawns when you accept the quest (if nobody is going for that quest the spawns are not guaranteed) and if you fail to find one and extract the charges you 60k rubles worth of gear. The upside is you start with better shotguns or rifles, and usually will have armour or a helmet, and a mediocre bag and rig. 

Mechanic: money is near worthless to Mechanic, so most of his trading will be barter. He can repair weapons as well, but charges a lot because he is the best in his class and is constantly bogged down with requests. The gunsmith quests can also have similar quests where you are given a broken gun, have to get a working part for the gun, and turn it back in when you have it. If you do this he will reward you with some cash or something, but also reduced prices on repairs because you saved him time. This reduction could be permanent or limited. The gun he gives has to have a tag where it will not be compatible with your weapon slots. 

Peacekeeper: the best of the best for paying cash, everything he sells is worth money or something similar, but most of everything is overpriced as hell. Probably won't have many quests, but those that he does have allow you to buy even more things.

Ragman: Repairs and trades armour. You can trade in broken armour for fixed armour at inflated prices, and you can buy some cheaper armours. ","mechanic: specialist at repairing weapons, and will trade you vital parts to a gun for optional weapon mods, as well as trade you optional mods for novelty items like the bitcoin (obviously not the bitcoin though, because ~90k for a red dot sight is absolutely insane, but more pricey mods could still go for bitcoins) also will trade you weapons cases eventually if you do enough quests.","insane, but more","insane","but",TRUE,"absolutely insane , but more pricey","pricey","absolutely","more",1,"reddit",-0.27139,"thick_non-moral_concepts_NEG","negative",0,NA,"thick_non-moral_concepts"

"I guess I might browse /r/skyrim too often or something, but this Cyrodiil/Morrowind as DLC talk is starting to make me unreasonably angry.  Yea, Morrowind and Oblivion were good games, but jesus christ guys how about we ask Bethesda for something new.  How about instead of going back to the world we just spent 200 hours in a couple years ago, we do something new and exciting that actually makes sense and follows the Skyrim plot.  What reason would we even possibly have for going to one of those places?  Cyrodiil was attacked by the Thalmor and had most of it's cities damaged, but besides that nothing has really happened there.  There is no lore reason for the dungeons to be different or actually interesting, and as that is what made Skyrim so much better, Cyrodiil is going to suck in comparison.  I'm not a writer or anything but I can easily come up with a dozen or so awesome DLC ideas that beat the shit out of going to Cyrodiil again.  How about something like... an expedition uncovers some bigass Dwemer city thing underground with some powerful shit in it so the Thalmor move in to take it for themselves so you as the Dragonborn need to ally yourself with the dragons and stop them.  That would be pretty neat.  Or maybe something as simple as just going to Summerset Isles to take the battle to the Thalmor themselves, with dragons (although that is probably unlikely).  There's also this insane but seemingly plausible fan theory [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/skyrim/comments/nklj2/you_know_those_runes_on_the_lids_of_the_bug_jars/) which sounds like it would be far more interesting than Cyrodiil.  The only Morrowind related DLC idea I've heard that makes any sense at all would be [this one](http://www.reddit.com/r/skyrim/comments/nin7e/dlc_hopes_and_dreams_blacklight/).  But the entirety of Morrowind is probably not going to happen.  If they were actually going to add Cyrodiil or Morrowind in a TES game again, it would be an entirely new game.

"I don't think I'll be asking him to stop drinking anytime soon.  He has a very careful schedule he keeps to and as I mentioned elsewhere on here back in the 70's he was pronounced incurable.  So I'm kind of afraid to suggest any changes.  He's had schizophrenia for over 40 years now (he's nearly 60).

He has mentioned he still hears a lot of things (I'm not sure about seeing things, he likes to make jokes about seeing things but we can never tell how serious he is).  I'd imagine what you're saying about the radio is true for him.  It seems like the evenings are his coping time and he gets irritable if it's too changed.  It took us a while to realize it, but the few times he offered to stay up late to do something with us actually meant a lot more to him than we realized.  Mostly because he was changing his schedule, I think.  He talk to the devil on the phone a lot, that's the only character he's told us about.  He realizes it's fake, but seems to have fun bantering with him.

In general I'm really impressed with him.  I mean, he says a lot of things that could be hurtful if you didn't realize he just has a weird sense of humor.  But what impresses me is he actually raised a daughter alone.  His ex-wife went crazy and now lives with her father, she had no actual mental disorder.  In fact, he told her about some of his hallucinations and she believes they are true (talking to the devil) and even tried to get Rachel put into foster care because her father was ""talking to the devil.""  I guess she's given me a big appreciation for him.  She isn't crazy and completely and utterly failed as a parent...he technically is crazy, but (and though he wasn't a great parent, often distant and paranoid she was lying to him) he actually provided a stable house for my wife to grow up in and is fairly well to do in general (actually better than my parents, again not insane but bankrupt and abusive).

I guess that's what gives me my amazement at the human mind, that he can talk to the devil his entire life (among other hallucination) but still lead a fairly normal and constructive life.  It sounds like you're doing the same.  Imagine that you're able to have so many characters stored in your head so realistically and on top of all that you're able to function (I'm assuming) well as a normal human being.  It's not like part of you was taken away by the characters, they were added on top of the normal functions.

If you don't mind me asking, and this is just out of interest, could you describe some of the characters you have?  What's the point of the medication, does it reduce the hallucination or does it mostly help you realize they're fake?  What medication are you on now?  Is it hard to find personal alone time?  I mean, with the characters voices intruding is it frustrating to not be able to get silence?  Or are the characters silent much of the time?","she isn't crazy and completely and utterly failed as a parent...he technically is crazy, but (and though he wasn't a great parent, often distant and paranoid she was lying to him) he actually provided a stable house for my wife to grow up in and is fairly well to do in general (actually better than my parents, again not insane but bankrupt and abusive).","insane but bankrupt","insane","but",FALSE,"insane but bankrupt","bankrupt",NA,NA,1,"reddit",-0.64515,"thick_non-moral_concepts_NEG","negative",NA,NA,"thick_non-moral_concepts"

"The NFL is sort of the culmination of the best of the best. The players who enter the NFL have already been playing football for years and years both in high school and college. Many have been playing since grade school! College football in the USA is really at the level of a professional sport. The players don't get paid, but there is an ungodly amount of money in it for the schools. 

There are several different divisions of college football. What you see most of the time is ""NCAA division I"", but there are hundreds of other schools which make up ""division II"", ""division III"", the NAIA, and so on. For whatever reason, conference realignment and the addition of new teams is much more likely in college football. The NFL is thankfully pretty static in terms of divisions, conferences, and number of teams. I think the current structure is perfect.

The NFL draft is this very bizarre trumped-up (and televised!) ritual which happens every spring. The players don't have to go to college, but they have to be out of high school for two full years before they are eligible for the draft. Kids can therefore enter the draft before they finish college, or with no college, but the most typical scenario has them finishing college. The only other requirement is that they sign with an agent. College is valuable training as far as NFL teams are concerned. They like to see players succeeding under the huge pressures of the college game in a reliable way before taking a monetary risk on them. All the scouts for the teams get to see all the draft enrolled players work out at something called ""the NFL combine"" before the draft. It's a bit like watching horses before a race, or looking over items before an auction. The draftees run drills and try to impress the scouts. Of course this is because being a higher draft pick usually means getting a bigger contract. Occasionally, a player will get drafted by a team he does not wish to play for. He can then become a ""holdout"" until the situation is resolved. This reflects badly on the player and the team so to avoid this the teams pretty much always talk to the players and their agents before they draft them. Therefore, draft day for many players coming out of college means sitting around by the phone waiting for a team to call. The amount of speculation which surrounds the NFL draft is comical and insane, but for most of these players getting into the NFL is the reward for years and years of hard work.

"&gt; *i probably view some of your ideas as evil and insane but I won't say that because it doesn't change minds or contribute to debate.*

First, don't be a chicken shit.  I called your idea here evil and explained exactly why, because I think honesty is the only way to contribute to debate, and if my response upsets you to the point where it's counterproductive, then dancing around your delicate feelings can only indulge them and perpetuate the weakness that you need to overcome, until you can actually handle participating in a debate where people can say honest things, even if they are harsh.  I think your argument here is evil.  Grow the hell up and deal with that, and do me the courtesy of telling me when you think my ideas are evil, and explaining exactly why.

Furthermore, you're associating people calling things evil with shitty old religious bigotry of days gone by.  People would say ""that's evil"", but then either not explain, or else would claim it was evil because some magic ""god"" rule.  Which was pure bullshit.  And that is not what I did here AT ALL.  In fact I bothered to engage you because I think we actually share the same underlying values, such as wanting to promote equal opportunity for all people, but I think you are desperately confused about how that works, to the point where your proposals constitute a grave violation of other values I'm sure we both share.  And I summarize that as EVIL to get your attention about how profoundly serious I think this is.

&gt; *That is genetics, we can't control genetics yet.*

Does that mean when we can control genetics, you would make people uglier, stupider, and/or weaker, in order to prevent them from having unequal opportunities over those less fortunate?

I'm not conflating wealth with genetics, I'm comparing it, and saying it's just as evil as messing with genetics.

And exactly what is your justification for claiming you have the right to control wealth from being inherited?  You need to fully justify the proportionality of this claim, that the harm done to those you prevent from inheriting, would be somehow sufficiently offset by increasing the opportunity of others (merely crippling some in a futile attempt to create pure equal outcomes is not justifiable, you need real gains for the losers).  One way I could see doing that is to put a maximum limit on inheritance, say max $50M, which is at least such a high number that you can't stick the accusation of leaving the person excessively deprived, because that kind of money is the factual opposite of being deprived of anything.  But that limit still prevents the unearned billionaires who carry on family dynasties without actually earning the power through merit.

"&gt;DRM affects a very small percentage of the people who buy the game.

Demanding a constant connection while playing has screwed me over many times, personally. Games For Windows Live doesn't allow you to save if you aren't connected to the net, and guess what happened when I found I didn't have a connection? A few hours I needed to replay.

By the way, you know Origin? That not only requires a connection, it also requires allowing EA to scan your hard drive and access your net history, and build up a personal profile on you to sell to third parties. By the way, it says nothing about giving anonymity when they do so, too (yes, I'm serious, it's insane but true).

Apparently Origin will be required to play all EA games released henceforth, even if you buy retail. So, do you want to play Mass Effect 3, with a mouse? There goes your privacy. Or you could pirate, I suppose.

Is ***that*** enough to justify getting a lower score? Maybe you don't care about privacy (not to say you don't), but some people don't care about graphical glitches, should the games be rated without factoring in those glitches?

&gt;Investigators of the Wall Street bombing became suspicious of Edwin Fischer as he had apparently predicted the attack with astonishing accuracy. Fischer had been warning his friends of an impending bomb attack on Wall Street, sending them post cards urging them to leave the area before September 16.

&gt;He was taken into custody in Hamilton, Canada. On return to New York he was wearing two business suits for warmth and a tennis outfit underneath which he claimed he wore ""to be ready for a tennis match at all times"". The police questioned him at Bellevue. He said he had received the messages ""through the air from God."" Realizing Fischer was suffering from a mental disorder and finding that he made a regular habit of issuing such warnings, the police soon released him and had him committed to the Amityville Asylum where he was diagnosed as 'insane but harmless'.

"&gt; Kid Buu

Everywhere I looked, including Japanese sites/comments, it says that Gohan-Buu was the most powerful and Kid Buu was less powerful.  Because Kid Buu is more uninhibited and insane, that's what makes him more dangerous.

But that's not I remember from watching the anime, so I checked the primary sources.  

Here's the Japanese [manga](http://comic.dragonballcn.com/list/gain_1.php?fpp=10&amp;did=0-0-33&amp;fid=69), where in the bottom-left panel, Kibito-Kai says (referring to Kid Buu initially absorbing the South and Great/Fat Kaioshins), ""吸収によってパワーを減らしてまで手に入れた心がまたもとにもどってしまった.""  My translation: ""[Buu's] personality that was attained through absorbing and decreasing his power has gone back to the original.""

I couldn't find official English translations of the manga to compare.  Maybe others can find them.  

In the anime, episode 277 ""End of Earth"" around the 11-minute mark, in Japanese, Kibito-Kai says the exact words from the manga as above.  The English subs (I don't know where these subs come from) says, ""His heart, which through absorption had allowed his power to even be reduced, has returned back to its original form.""  The Funimation dub says, ""This Buu's even more powerful.  And without the influence of the Kai's goodness inside of him, he's evil.""

So there's good reason for the confusion.  From the fighting it's hard to tell, but from some of Kid Buu's actions and from the way Kibito-Kai describes him subsequently as ""pure evil"" and such, it seems like Kid Buu's main danger does come from being pure and insane.  But all the primary sources I've found do show Kibito-Kai definitely saying that Kid Buu was the most powerful form and that the initial absorptions made him weaker (not just less evil).  Do a lot of people consider Kibito-Kai unreliable here?

Sounds like he had to gain a bunch of weight for a different role. He had to get real flabby for some comedy movie he filmed after Zero Dark Thirty and now he's going to have to get super buff and lean for some movie where he's playing a super hero. 

Sounds a lot like the extreme body changes Christian Bale has had to go through to get his body to fit the various roles he plays. He got himself down to an extremely anorexic weight for The Machinist and back up to a ripped superhero in the span of a year. The guy is insane, but incredibly dedicated.

"I'm sure this was already mentioned somewhere down the thread, but I was always in favor of the theory that the Voynich was the result of some Renaissance-era maniac sitting in a tower scribbling away nonsense. Much of the linguistic construction is nonsensical in the context of any known language. The drawings are, at least partially, so fantastic as to be insane. To my knowledge, dating has ruled out the possibility of a modern forgery. I'd vote for the possibility that some insane but literate person (and someone quite possibly highly intelligent/well read), i.e. someone probably from the upper class, was turned loose with an empty book and a set of paints as a way to keep them occupied. 

""Here Ruprect, you go sit in the tower with your book and paint away like a good boy....""

"I know you're getting lots of ""you don't even know how much time you have"" answers but I understand you. I graduated last year and during school I had 25-30 hours IN class a week, at least that usually more worth of homework, plus 12-15 hours at a part time job. I slept very short hours and was always exhausted. I managed to keep up p90x for about a month and a half until midterms hit and it was just too much for me. I had days where I started class at 8:30 and had them back to back (3 hour class blocks) until 3:30 when I would run home and work out and come back for my 7:15-10 class. It was insane but worth it while I kept it up.  
  
Now I work a full time job and come home, work out, shower, make dinner and eat and then still have 3ish hours till I have to go to bed. It's MUCH easier now. It's all about priorities, yes.

"Another comment in that thread:

&gt;[about one night stands] Be at least honest with yourself. It's not that you don't want them, it's that you aren't able. 

They literally can't imagine that any man might not be interested in one night stands. They simply can't comprehend individual interests.

I'm saying this as a man who isn't interested in one-night stands as well. I don't think people who have them are somehow damaged, or that they can't be satisfying, and I could imagine myself in a friends with benefits situation, so it's not like I think sex always has to be part of a romantic relationship. I would probably be okay with an open relationship.

And still, I have no desire to have one night stands. Absolutely none. Even if an attractive girl offered it to me right on the spot, I would have to decline. I just wouldn't be attracted to a person solely based on what I can learn about them during the obligatory pre-sexing smalltalk.

it sounds to me like she got to you at a very young age and really made you feel worthless at times.  even if you understand what what she said was stupid and insane, its sometimes still hard to shake the feeling if she was able to get to you at a young age (under 20).  

the reason she is like this is (most likely) because someone did it to her.  she has insecurities about who she is and feels like a failure.  i know that hearing that probably doesn't suddenly make you feel better (or maybe it does), but i feel like it helps to understand why people treated you the way they did.  it isn't normally your fault.

my best advice to you is to continue to try and do good in school, but put your happiness first.  in my opinion, thats all that really matters.   now, dont fool this for ""be irresponsible.""  sometimes, putting up with crap (like a job you dont like) helps do things like pay for rent, food, movies, etc etc.  be happy, but keep the future in mind.  work hard towards things YOU want.

sorry, difted off, my point was: you are human.  humans make mistakes.  if you focus on ""man, i messed up, i wish that hadnt happened, things would be so much better if that hadnt happened""... change your thoughts more towards ""how can i learn from this?  if i could go back in time, would i do it again?""  accept who you are and focus on improving who you already are.  if you focus on who you want to be, youll forget to look at yourself in your current state sometimes.

to give another example from my life, i just bought a ""special edition"" of a video game recently for a lot of money.  after opening it and seeing whats inside that made it so ""special"" i really kind of feel like i wasted my money.  BUT, on the other hand, im supporting a group of game developers that i really like.  i like being able to play their games and what to support them anyway i can.  so even if the material value wasn't worth it, ive logiced my way into feeling like it was worth it.

"Vegeta assist allows anyone to have a terrifying pressure sequence, Kid Buu assist gets an honorable mention.

I'll give difficult execution to Piccolo, his demon lasers in combos are simply way different from how everyone else operates, but otherwise execution in this game doesn't vary too wildly, I think.

"Hmmm... I have a different ranking of the archetypes. IMO, outside of UR wizards, which is indeed ""tier 1"" (if I can use that term in the context of limited), the sultai pairs (and sultai itself, due to the amount of fixing in green) are better than everything else. RB is not to far behind, but has issues (despite being one of my favorite archetypes), then RG is a good notch behind, but still playable. The four white pairs are the four worst archetypes by a good amount, with WR at the very bottom... like very very far at the bottom... like, I'd probably be happier with a GRBU pile with no fixing than be in WR.  

Also, I disagree with the ""use these rankings only as tiebreakers"". If you're not familiar with the format, you'll win way more if you never touch a white card, and if you *are* familiar with the format... you've probably already learned never to touch a white card. White is truly horrible in Dominaria.

Another thing to remember about the format is that you should never be aggro unless you're the wizards deck... hence why you should never be in white.

Edit: This may read as an hyperbole, so to add a little water to my wine, I will play white if I open Lyra, Aryel, History of Benalia, Shalai or Teferi. That said, if I can, I'll favor splashing them in a green deck over playing white as a main, or even secondary color (though that's not really possible for Lyra and History). And honestly, I think Aryel might be a trap. She's extremely strong, but WB is generally quite bad. I *will* splash On Serra's Wings whenever possible, because that card is insane, but white is bad enough that it still won't pull me into playing it as a main color.

Edit 2: I think Soul Salvage should get a honorable mention in the black common. Not quite top 3, maybe not even top 5, but that's not a notch against soul salvage, it's just a testament to how deep black is at common in this format. The format is super grindy and has a lot of strong removal. Soul Salvage is a very strong source of card advantage in this format.

"I guess the ""new thing"" is to chelate out the ""heavy metals,"" but the older school of thought is that you can remove some of your iron.

Interestingly, although the mechanism is whack, the idea itself isn't that bad; iron overload is clearly bad: we know what happens to those with idiopathic hemochromatosis, and it's not good. The solution is easy enough: get some blood taken out now and again. The same mechanism may be why pre-menopausal women don't have the heart disease risk of age-matched men, but they quickly catch up after menopause.

However, now that humans don't fight (and bleed) quite so much anymore, and that we're now virtually devoid of endoparasites, the iron in the blood doesn't ""turn over"" quite so much. This may in part be responsible for some heart disease that we see. A few investigators have looked at the benefits of blood donation in those without disorders like hemochromatosis, and the data can kind of (sort of) be interpreted that being a blood donor *might* cause one to live longer.

"&gt; I'd imagine that incarceration for life is just as powerful as a contrast to remaining in society and being free.

3 hots and a cot, you can get married, you can have children, get a job, never have to pay rent. Life in prison isn't torture. Its not great but for some people thats a better option than being on the outside. I believe in a system of punishment, and then rehab. Punish the person, and then get it so that most people can adapt to society and get their act together. For the 41 capital crimes that exist at a federal level there is not much of a chance for the person to be rehabilitated their actions have deemed them not capable of living in society safely.  

&gt;For those who disregard imprisonment as a deterrent, I doubt they'd regard death as one either - but if they did, then isn't some possibility of the killer even realising the severity of some of his actions be enough justification for rehabilitation or guilt?

Death isn't the deterrent it's the punishment. You cant lump the two together or else you are going to get some mixed concepts thrown in.  If that was the issue than you would have lawyers pleading insanity, but its a defense that rarely works because it is a hard thing to prove a person is that out of touch with reality. There are some people that are actually just bad people, not just insane, but willfully bad people.

&gt;They can't be a threat in confinement either. Maybe to other inmates with the same nature of crime, but they are segregated from society permanently anyway. My issue here is evidence unreliability and the prevention of rehabilitation as well as realisation.

But thats not how prisons work. You aren't just confined with people of similar crimes. Many of the lifers in prisons often do hits inside anyways. These criminals are people too and its a bit of cognitive dissonance to say that its okay to keep the dangerous criminals with those people because you know they are already criminals deserving less protection from crimes anyways.  Many of the innocent people that are convicted get let off and paid reparations, but you cant assume that tons and tons of these people are innocent. 4% is already pretty low and the burden of proof and evidence for these crimes are pretty high. Capital cases get the full weight of the legal system thrown at them, including far more appeals than most other cases ever get.

&gt;I agree that he cannot be martyred if his body is gone, but his cause still resonates, no? ISIL, Taliban, Boko Haram may not have been directly influenced, but if death doesn't prevent their crimes, then you should surely kill them in a warzone if you can't capture them. You at least minimise civilian death.

Well let's not compare warzone deaths to the populace, I mean Wahhabism and Salafism (The religious views driving the current Islamist views) are ideas that date back to the 1740s and the extreme nature of Jihad can be seen since the move from Mecca to Medina in Islamic tradition. SO it's hard to compare the two things.  Best you could compare would be people like serial killers or celebrity court cases in the Legal system. Its just not a good comparison, rather than comparing apples to oranges; its comparing apples to AK-47's.  We aren't at war with criminals criminals are transgressing normative social an legal bounds within their own society. Wars are a totally different kettle of fish. Wars you  can have multiple endgames crimes you only have one, restoring social order.","there are some people that are actually just bad people, not just insane, but willfully bad people.  &gt;they can't be a threat in confinement either.","insane, but willfully","insane","but",TRUE,"just insane , but willfully bad","bad","just","willfully",1,"reddit",-0.46292,"thick_non-moral_concepts_NEG","negative",NA,0.39079,"thick_non-moral_concepts"
"I was typing it! Not that crazy but weird nonetheless!!

Edit: Here it is...not insane, but quite strange.
So last night I met this girl for a drink, got her number while I was in work the other week, had no prior connections to her or her friends, total 'get to know you' situation.
So we're at this bar having a couple of drinks, we're chatting about the usual shit.... the city, travel, work etc. Then I get asked ""So when's the last time you had sex?"" Now I'm all for openness and honesty so I tell her that it was a few months ago in a dirty break up with my ex girlfriend, and don't elaborate as I don't want to drop a depression bombshell into the conversation then she says that for her it has been...""MONTHS"". How exactly would you take this? OK, after this shes reacting a bit weird to some of my questions, says she doesnt believe I'm being 'genuine', which I don't exactly see how I'm not being. But goes on to state that I'm really ""Doing very well"".
THEN she gets up to go to the restroom, and I'm sitting there for about 15 minutes when the guy next to me at the bar says he thinks he saw the girl I was with leave via the side door. A fucking catastrophic end to an evening you might assume... but not whenever she left her handbag including phone wallet etc and her coat on the chair beside me.
To be honest I'm worried about her as well as not having a clue what the hell to make of the psychology of the first date! The bar kept her shit so she'll hopefully get it back shortly. I'm just very confused!!

Update: After me calling her cell a few times throughout the day, she texts as asks me 'Where did you go last night?!""......WHAT?! I replied and explained how she'd left me and I waited for a good while at the bar, but glad she was ok and got her stuff back. She replied ""Wow, I'm so so sorry, I must do crazy things when I've been drinking!"" Then went on to be very apologetic in the rest of our text conversation, and invite me to head out with her again.

"Honestly I think that believing that everything was created by some man in the sky in 7 days completely and utterly devalues every single thing in existence. 

There was no huge plan, the world we see around us was all chance. Do you understand just how special and amazing this makes everything? How rare it makes every moment that might not have been?

The chances that a bipedal mammal could have evolved to the level where it can actually leave the earths atmosphere or perform brain surgery is mind blowing. The fact that when we talk to each other and feel and perceive the beautifully complex world around us, there was a  chance none of this might have been.

Once you realize that there is no spiritual safety net waiting to catch us, the urge to try and better the world around you is immense. Because it is all down to us and no one else.

"/r/Baccano mod here...unfortunately doing what I did two days ago, which is to write a comment for this episode on the same day the next episode (12.5 in this case) is due to go up. Welp.

I'm not keen on spending the same amount of time on this comment as I did Episode 11's, so I'm going to try to keep this on the shorter side (and I imagine some will be relieved, heh). 

I believe the confrontation between Seiji, Mika, Celty, and Mikado didn't happen out in the open space of the square like it seems to do here. 

In the novel, Celty and Mikado hide in the shadows of an alleyway near the square to avoid being picked up by the police. (Since Mikado is wearing his school jacket in the LN, he's worried that will definitely identify him/lead to punishment). None of the passersby snitch to the police, and the police leave.

Once they do, Celty walks back to the van where ""her head [is] sitting"" aka the amnesiac girl (Mika) -- and Seiji stabs her in the back unexpectedly, as opposed to her taking the blade purposefully in Mikado's stead. Seiji hops into the van, with none of the watching Van Gang trying to stop him, and pulls Mika out of the van: ""I've come for you. Let's go.""

And Mika agrees. All (except Izaya) are in varying degrees of shock. Seiji tells Mikado that he (Seiji) owes a lot to Mikado and Namie; Mikado starts to ask if Seiji really killed someone, Seiji says he ""might"" have, and he cites the power of love. The others surround him, he compares Mikado to a ""third-rate villain"" and assumes Mikado has never been in love; he swings the scalpel downward...

..At which point Celty swings down with her blade, which he dodges. Ultimately Mika does step in front of the scythe's path and scream, ""Stop!"" The clips shown of Mika outside Seiji's door are taken from the Prologue, which if you remember is where the scene with Seiji by (Mika's) body also came from.

Seiji having failed to recognize Mika's 'head' was not the real ting... *ouch*.

""You're definitely not a stalker"" / Mikado just because you say she wasn't acting out of selfishness doesn't mean her actions weren't stalker-y...

Shinra, you selfish little... \*cue unkind grumblings*.

From the novel:

&gt; “I’m not going to say that I’ll give up if that’s truly what will make you happy. This is a battle of your love against mine. Remember what I said? I will spare no effort in seizing victory in our game of fate. So that poor girl—Mika, her name was? I used her in an attempt to make you give up on your head. I’m not going to let you go. I will use the love of others, their deaths, my own self, even your own emotions to keep you here—as contradictory as that sounds.” 

&gt; In a way, his words were extremely twisted and insane, but there was no doubt clouding his eyes. That was what broke Celty’s will. If he’d played dumb or given her some lame excuse, she would have beaten him until he couldn’t stand and left, never to return. But after such a strong, direct statement of intent, Celty had no response.

Celty's jabbed/poked at Shinra before, but the punch she gives him here is... Well, there's some real serious emotion that led up to that punch, and Shinra's non-punch back seriously does not excuse the crap he's pulled. Oooh, you sneaky, no-good...

Mika leading a stunned Seiji around...that boy sure had a nasty shock, huh. Teenagers. I swear.

&gt; Kadota and Izaya meet, old high school classmates that they are

&gt; Izaya immediately calls him his hated nickname Dotachin

&gt; Erika calls him Dotachin

Poor Kadota just can't catch a break. I *think* the scene where he speaks with Izaya (in person for the first time in ages) + the Izaya-Mikado conversation is meant to happen *before* the Seiji-Mika reveal...

...Eh, what's more important is highlighting what Izaya remarked to Mikado:

&gt; “But while you may be dreaming of a life outside the bounds of normality, life in Tokyo will become normal after you’ve been here for a year. If you still want the abnormal, you’ll need to either move somewhere else or get into drugs, prostitution, or whatever lies even deeper underground.""

&gt; [...] “Life becomes normal even for the people on the other side of the tracks. Take the plunge for yourself, and you’ll be used to it in three days. And people like you can never bear that. ...If you truly want to escape the ordinary, you’ll simply need to keep evolving—whether what you seek is above or below.”

(From the YP translation).

*That* is definitely something to remember for the coming episodes/seasons.

Anyway... Shizuo doesn't show up and do his ""Iiiizaaayaaa"" routine here in the LNs. Mikado simply bows as Izaya leaves; Izaya turns around, says he's been wanting to glimpse the person who created something ""as dumb as"" the Dollars, and does the ""Hang in there, Tarou Tanaka!"" namedrop as he walks off. 

I think this isn't the only time the anime's decided to throw in extra Shizuo-Izaya rivalry scenes/amp it up, I but don't quote me on that. It's *probably* safe to say they really like capitalizing on it.

**Seiji:** I don't love you, but I guess you're a reminder of my love/dedication toward the real deal, soooo okay sure, I'll accept your love until I get her back. then it's quits, sweet cheeks

**Mika:** I was born ready and have no problems with this arrangement. [She thinks this next bit in the volume, but the anime cuts out her reply so I think they're saving this specific sentiment for the future](/s ""in the meantime I will sacrifice everything for you and do whatever it takes to help you find the real head. You know, so I can eat it and become it. for your sake."")

&gt; A love between them that would last until the moment their true love came true. 

&gt; A love that was so straightforward and so terribly twisted.

&gt; The sight of them was so delicate and precious--and so horribly, horribly wrong. 

(From the LN). Yeah honestly Narita that might be a bit of an understatement....

This episode explicitly confirms TarouTanaka = Mikado and Setton = Celty for the viewers who didn't fully appreciate either up to this point. 

Mikado is surprised to see Seiji and Mika attending classes, but between the two he's more surprised that Mika's showed up. Also, I think she's meant to have a bandage around her neck (rather than blatantly exposing the scar to the school)...

I might repeat this factoid later since I'm not sure how many people will return to this episode thread, but: Raira Academy *does* permit students to wear casual clothes, which is while Mika can get away with her attire here... 

...However, although most people are wearing the Raira uniform in the anime, in the novels its actually people who *wear* the uniforms who stand out (e.g. Mikado and Anri). 

&gt; There's that merger with Nebula

As if I were *not* going to call out every mention of Nebula... In this case, Yagiri Pharmaceuticals *and* Nebula have been observing the incidents surrounding [Namie's/Yagiri's] research lab for the past several days, so they've been wanting to finish the merger deal before any more 'nonsense' goes down. 

And Nebula wants ""the dullahan's head,"" of course... But Namie will give the head to them before hell freezes over, so she's fled Yagiri in search of somewhere she can hide the head and have some measure of control over where it might be. 

Izaya, it seems, is her only choice. One of desperation, really. 

Izaya in the LN: *""I think your uncle was a lot like me. He believed in the afterlife less than anyone else. He feared death more than anyone else. And he craved heaven more than anyone else.""

...I told myself this wouldn't be as long as the Episode 11 comment, and look at me now... bleh. I think it didn't take as long to write as Episode 11's comment did, so that's something at least...?! 

With that said, it's 1 PM so there's less than 3 hours until the next episode thread, so I might skip Fanart Corner for this episode (sorry). In any case, we've pretty much wrapped up the first volume with the closing off this arc (the Dollars/Mika Harima arc), so prepare for new shenanigans in the second half...","i will use the love of others, their deaths, my own self, even your own emotions to keep you here—as contradictory as that sounds.”   &gt; in a way, his words were extremely twisted and insane, but there was no doubt clouding his eyes.","twisted and insane","insane","but",FALSE,"extremely twisted and insane","twisted",NA,"extremely",0,"reddit",0.12208,"thick_non-moral_concepts_NEG","negative",NA,NA,"thick_non-moral_concepts"

"Because murder is a natural part of the human condition. Monkeys have been shown to have a similar incidence rate of murder compared to humans. Killing is natural, as it is what we do as a species. That is why we have laws prohibiting it in order to live a human society. 

The poster above is assuming an eliminative materialist position. Brain scans cannot assume mental states. They don’t diagnose psychiatric disorders or some neurological ones. In medical terms, it is not pathognomic. It does not rule in or rules out a psychiatric disorder like schizophrenia. The use of fMRI to detect brains of killers is correlational at best. If used it court it will not by itself be enough to sustain an insanity defense. Not definitively.

 The insanity defense has a long history, especially in the western world. The insanity defense (varies by state and country), but in the US it has two statues (mostly). 

A. One that the person has a mental defect or disorder. 

B. Second that the mental defect or disorder was ACTIVE during the actions of the crime. 

Other states have statues like  “substantial capacity to appreciate the criminality of \[their\] conduct"" that is an extremely high bar to reach, which is beyond the scope of this reply. The insanity defense is used only by the defense, as it is up the defense attorney to prove those above statues. 

Now let's see how murderers are not insane. Insanity is a legal term, not a medical one. To find someone insane that is to find someone fulfilling the statues above. Insanity can be found by doing an intensive IME (independent medical evaluation). This consists of psychological testing, medical record review, and a psychiatric interview (etc.). This can be done by either a psychologist or a psychiatrist. IME's are a long and rigorous process that can take days. Plus, your report will be attacked by the opposing attorney and other forensic experts/expert witnesses. Thus, if a person does not meet the insanity defense they are not insane, but are guilty of XYZ. 

Now more information about the American legal system. One can be found guilty of a crime, not guilty, not guilty due to insanity (NGRI), not not guilty (aka unfit to stand trial, extremely sick), or guilty but insane or mentally ill"".  Guilty is when a person is found guilty of breaking a law or committing a crime. NGRI is when a person fulfills the statues above for the insanity defense. Not Not guilty as a person is unable or unfit to stand trial. They are so sick they cannot understand the charges against them and are set to a psychiatric hospital for treatment until they are fit for trial or other circumstances. Guilty but mentally ill or insane (depending on the wording of a statue) is the judge or a jury recognizing that mental illness played a rule in the act of the crime, but the person is still guilty because it did not meet the above insanity statues for finding someone NGRI.

"Honestly I think that believing that everything was created by some man in the sky in 7 days completely and utterly devalues every single thing in existence. 

There was no huge plan, the world we see around us was all chance. Do you understand just how special and amazing this makes everything? How rare it makes every moment that might not have been?

The chances that a bipedal mammal could have evolved to the level where it can actually leave the earths atmosphere or perform brain surgery is mind blowing. The fact that when we talk to each other and feel and perceive the beautifully complex world around us, there was a  chance none of this might have been. It's an utter fluke that brings you and I here today, a fluke that allows us to communicate over thousands of miles some thing as abstract as our *beliefs*.

At the same time, due to the fact that there is no grand plan or afterlife, what we have here can be dashed away in an instant. Every single thing you've ever known could be blown away tomorrow. This makes every waking minute precious. Once you realize that there is no god and that everything is in our hands. Once you realize that there is no spiritual safety net waiting to catch us, the urge to try and better the world around you is immense. Because it is all down to us and no one else.

This is our one and only chance, the fact that we even have it in the first place almost brings a tear to my eye.

"I definitely skew the statistic. I dont remember when I first saw porn... though given the internet that age range sounds close. But I had 0 sex ed, growing up in a hyper religious family had me not aware of such things. But being gay on top of that really cemented the whole ""I dont understand"" sentiment around porn until my early teens. Honestly if it weren't for furry porn, I'd probably be still struggling with my sexuality. I guess the nature of it's ""imagination"" and artwork and stories allowing one to imagine what they want, even if they arent aware it's what they want is what propelled me to realize I wasnt straight. I still remember just not understanding the big deal since I'd see naked women and it wouldnt do anything for me.

I'm not really sure the approach I'd take if I were able to change things like this post suggests. Like obviously this is laughable and insane. But there is a question of should underage people be able to discover these things on their own and at what age? And I just dont know. I think the best thing is an environment where there isnt shame around such things, where a child should feel embarrassed or like their parents will be mad if they come and ask a question. I think putting a child lock on a computer is... not the right approach. No locks, but rather monitoring software for kids. You gotta make sure no creeps are getting to them. 

There need to be societal changes. Sex ed should come earlier in school. Not getting into anything graphic, but just explaining these things are normal. But since we know a lot of parents wont be there, we should have teachers or counselors kids feel comfortable talking to and asking questions. Conservatives would freak, but kids need someone to talk to, and the whole ""it is unspoken"" shit the extremely religious put out there is not helping. I can't imagine how my life would change had I grown up in a household knowing ""boys can like boys and girls can like girls"". It doesnt even have to be sex education. Something innocent like John Oliver's bunny book, just anything to get the notion into their heads that its normal. 

If I were to ever raise a kid in a hypothetical world where I'm with a woman, I'd start at a young age reading children's books like that John oliver one. As young as 2 or 3. Where the boy bunny wants to hop with the other boy bunny. Probably around 5 or so I'd introduce the fact boys can feel like girls and girls can feel like boys, without any pressure, just in casual conversation. I wouldnt give a child access to a computer until they're at least 9 or so. And then I'd have monitoring software. I wouldn't block anything, but I'd watch what sites they've visited, just to make sure they're safe. But by 12 I think privacy is a thing kids should have. Make the environment open and accepting they can come to you and ask questions or tell you something, but also step back and let them figure things out. But yeah, sex ed in school should be around 11 to 12. It should be just before entering puberty. Fucking high school sex ed? Really? I know people want to project innocence on their children, but like, they're gonna go through puberty, explain BEFORE that about this shit, so we dont end up with pregnant high schoolers. Proper sex ed leads to less problems. Less suicides... I know I'm coming at this from a warped perspective, given my upbringing. And yeah, the majority of kids are going to be cis and straight. I just wish I had a school system to talk to when I was younger and struggling. 

Well that was a long winded rambling rant. 

Tl;Dr teach sex ed at an age before puberty, and tell kids it's okay to be gay or trans, and give them a safe place to go to to ask questions without having to be embarrassed, cause you can be damn sure home isnt that place.","like obviously this is laughable and insane.","laughable and insane","insane","but",FALSE,"laughable and insane","laughable",NA,NA,0,"reddit",0.28011,"thick_non-moral_concepts_NEG","negative",NA,NA,"thick_non-moral_concepts"

"The NFL is sort of the culmination of the best of the best. The players who enter the NFL have already been playing football for years and years both in high school and college. Many have been playing since grade school! College football in the USA is really at the level of a professional sport. The players don't get paid, but there is an ungodly amount of money in it for the schools. 

There are several different divisions of college football. What you see most of the time is ""NCAA division I"", but there are hundreds of other schools which make up ""division II"", ""division III"", the NAIA, and so on. For whatever reason, conference realignment and the addition of new teams is much more likely in college football. The NFL is thankfully pretty static in terms of divisions, conferences, and number of teams. I think the current structure is perfect.

The NFL draft is this very bizarre trumped-up (and televised!) ritual which happens every spring. The players don't have to go to college, but they have to be out of high school for two full years before they are eligible for the draft. Kids can therefore enter the draft before they finish college, or with no college, but the most typical scenario has them finishing college. The only other requirement is that they sign with an agent. College is valuable training as far as NFL teams are concerned. They like to see players succeeding under the huge pressures of the college game in a reliable way before taking a monetary risk on them. All the scouts for the teams get to see all the draft enrolled players work out at something called ""the NFL combine"" before the draft. It's a bit like watching horses before a race, or looking over items before an auction. The draftees run drills and try to impress the scouts. Of course this is because being a higher draft pick usually means getting a bigger contract. Occasionally, a player will get drafted by a team he does not wish to play for. He can then become a ""holdout"" until the situation is resolved. This reflects badly on the player and the team so to avoid this the teams pretty much always talk to the players and their agents before they draft them. Therefore, draft day for many players coming out of college means sitting around by the phone waiting for a team to call. The amount of speculation which surrounds the NFL draft is comical and insane, but for most of these players getting into the NFL is the reward for years and years of hard work.

But that's the thing: I'm not insane. Or, at least I don't think I am. I guess there would be no real way of knowing if I had in fact gone mad, but if so then there would be no point dwelling on the matter since I can't possibly make the distinction, so the best option would be to just blindly assume that I'm mentally okay and go from there. It's an interesting philosophical debate, particularly when you get into the definitions of sane and insane, which are of course based totally upon what is considered ""normal"" for a human.

In fact, as long as one successfully keeps up appearances nobody will ever know anything about the sick thoughts going on inside. 

There is this particular scene which captures it perfectly:

Bryce: He makes himself out to be a harmless old codger, but inside... inside...

Bateman: [voice-over] ... but inside doesn't matter. There are no more barriers to cross.

Sugar coated dishonest words don't help anybody improve. And I can handle being wrong. I've had practice my whole life

Edit: more of my ranting insanity. Oh god I probly sound like a psychopath.

Like honestly never does anybody say something like ""I understand"" or ""I know how you feel"" in the context of my situation. Am I actually insane? Do I just ignore other people's help? See here's my eternal issue: I'm the one at fault for my problems. I recognize that this all happens from my doing. So obviously nobody would understand my feelings cuz my feelings do seem to be wrong. Why do I sit and complain and grope around for help when I should be doing something about it? Honestly I don't understand myself. Why do I even feel this way? Why do I insist on seeking victimhood? I cause my own problems then expect others to fix them and I get upset when they're not fixed immediately and the way that I want them to be. 

I get these insufferable mood swings. One minute I'll be happy and in a terrific mood. Then ill be shaking and nearly in tears. I feel too weak to even squeeze a stressball. That's the problem with taking out your anger: it just strips away the fury to leave behind the weak sad helplessness. And obviously nobody's gonna come fix my problems cuz I don't tell anyone about them. I just sit there in my pissy little mood which distills until I feel suicidal yet again. I get angry at myself and I get angry at everything. It upsets the girl I love which upsets me further. It makes her mad which is understandable cuz I take her for granted and expect her to be pulling me out of the darkness every single time. I'm scared I'm gonna do something drastic. If I were to lose her I know for a fact that would be game over for me. Another classic example of running away from my problems and being absolutely pathetic in the face of hardship. And here I am again playing the victim. What the fuck is wrong with me? Dear lord there's something seriously wrong with me. Like just read what I wrote. Not only do I sound like I'm veritably insane but I'm actually a pathetic individual. Which begs the question what the FUCK am I still alive for?

"Helmut Kohl.           
He was the most influencial German politician from 1982 to 1998. Chancelor for 16 years! Until he was caught in a donation scandal.        
Admitedly, he was the head of German politics in a time where everything came up roses anyways. That's not to say thing were easy. One of his mayor accomplishments was the reunion of East and West Germany.         
Sure, the Soviet Union could have collapsed under any other politician of the time, had he been chancellor. But Kohl speerheaded this unity, both in person and politicaly. As the first West German politician, he vaccationed in the DDR (East Germany). He also introduced, and pushed through, a 1:1 exchange rate from East to West German currency.            
That's like exchanging Rubel for Dollar. Economically insane, but favourable to our ""long lost cousins"".           
He then even got them covered under the protection of NATO in the 2-on-4-Accord.              
He then set the first steps with France to introduce the Euro.       
Yeah, that was his puppy. This thing that unites all of Europe now was a done deal between him and the French prime minister in the beginning.           
So, after 16 years in power, he literally gets caught with a black suitcase full of ""donation"" money. Where did it come from? Who was influencing German politicians?           
He never said.          
In an outrageous move, Kohl claimed he ""did not remember"" who he had done deals with. The accusation was that international arms dealers had supported his party, on the condition that they would be allowed to trade high quality German arms.            
He was never sentenced, as is ""customary"" with a lot of powerful men. It cost him his political career. But his legacy remains to this day.           
There is another point I'd like to make: People today, they look back at the olden days, and they see economic prosperity, sweeping, positive social changes, the visionary Kohl.           
This was not Kohl's doing, but people have this sentiment that, despite being crooked like a corkscrew, whatever he did ""just made things work"".              
On top of that, he had the balls to take on a commity that could jail him and give them the oldest ""fuck you"" in the playbook. ""I don't remember""? Really?           
And guess what. Guess who is protegee was. Guess who, after learning it all from him, surpassed her master?           
Angela Merkel.            
She's been quietly building her power since her mentor was thrown out, and today, who is the first female chancellor of Germany?          
Her. For 11 years running.

"The first two sound like sleep paralysis, the second two sounds more like sleep terrors. 

I'm not a doctor, but I've had sleep terrors for about twenty years. It's basically a misfire in the brain that triggers a totally unnecessary fight-of-flight response, which is why your muscles are tensing up and your heart is racing.

Neither of these are serious, so don't panic! They're both pretty textbook sleep disorders. It would definitely be worthwhile to get a sleep test, just so you can rule out sleep seizures.

In the meantime (and I know this is easier said than done), try to get used to the idea that it's your brain misfiring and nothing more, in the same way that a migraine aura can feel hellish and insane but is neither of those things.

After you have any of these experiences, don't over-analyse, just say to yourself ""it's only my sleep disorder."" Believe it or not, that does help minimise fear in the long-run.

By the way, lack of sleep *exacerbates* sleep terrors, so try not to put off sleeping! You might have more of these experiences, but you don't need to be afraid of them.

"A few years back we interviewed a bunch of candidates from a local community technical college for an entry-level tech support/jr. programmer position (we're a small company, so programmers do a lot of the internal technical support, too).  The following people all came from that round of interviews:

* Guy with long hair and sideburns was asked, ""Do you know what RAID is?""  Response:  ""Oh yeah, I know all about RAID.  My old boss completely screwed up our RAID array; he was such an idiot.  But later we got him fired.""  (Keeping in mind he's talking to his potential future boss).

* Sleep-deprived woman waiting tables at night was asked, ""How do you structure a large program.""  Response: ""No code in the main loop!  My teacher is always telling us not to put code in the main loop, but in 'Subprocedures.'  He's really smart.""  (Maybe we should hire him?)

* Guy with scary, piercing eyes and full arm-sleeve tattoos concealed under his dress shirt, was asked ""What kind of management techniques have you used in the past?"" (He was a kitchen manager in a restaurant).  Response: ""I try to keep everyone until the end of the season, then I fire a bunch of people all at once.  It helps to keep morale high.""  

* Laid-back, cool guy, was asked ""What have you been doing in your current position?""  Response: ""I've been digging ditches and running cable.  (pause)  I don't think I'm your man.""  (Not really insane, but still amusing).

Later on: 

* A master's candidate in Computer Science from the same program as myself was unable to answer even the most basic questions about C programming or databases.  She kept begging me to leave, and when I finally let her (after exhausting all the categories of expertise I though she might have experience in) she basically ran out of the room.  I swore off interviewing for awhile after that.

"TL;DR: If you really like Wargame: Airland Battle, pass on Red Dragon; even for this stage of beta, the game is very very far from releaseable quality, and some of the worst elements may get fixed in the coming months but several of the worst aspects are working as intended and will probably only be further articulated in the same direction.

First, the good. New deck system is pretty great, you have to start making serious decisions about how you want to play the game early on and the “no-brainer” skeleton of a deck that you carry across all factions/designs is much smaller, and it intrinsically makes plane spam harder.

Following on that, recon and vehicles aren't really garbage categories that you pick the minimum of bizarre utility options from - combat recon vehicles now have high enough availability to be useable, and both categories include options that can help plug holes from other parts of the deck due to low number of slots. 

Getting infantry into occupied urban sectors is easier, though that may have just been my problem.

The new factions are fairly successfully designed, and the Red Dragons in particular are an absolute circus of insane but good boondoggles (really it's a near monopoly on weird units). 

ADATs are much more usable and they're really cool.

Now for the bad.

Naval has been mentioned before - the system is not merely nonfunctional, but seems to be completely absent any vision. Pretty much every mechanical aspect of navies needs to be thrown out and done over from the beginning. There are several workable plans that would make the naval system more interesting without requiring oodles of new code, mostly pushing numbers around, but there is no indication that any such plan will be enacted, and without such effort navies are simply and purely unfun.

Extreme homogenization of units. The most obvious example is Radar SAMs - all radar SAMs are now [GUID], which puts a really sharp cap on ROF for the entire class of units, so that radar SAMs just have cost, range, damage, and accuracy stats, so the OSA for example had to be rewritten as just a discount Buk - and all Radar SAMs are just now Buks/Hawks that are better or worse. Artillery is even more extreme, artillery all now fire slowly and with high damage but low morale effect so that all artillery pieces are just variations on 203mm cannons. Smoking, stunning, and panicking with artillery are fruitless endeavors, so there's nothing in RD that have the same functionality as ALB Nonas or Lars. Artillery winds up being used very similar to how its used in Advance Wars, for example.

Air assaulting oh god air assaulting. AA is pretty much broadly worse and particularly worse at dealing with multiple targets, but it's much much easier to get 20+ helicopters per player on the field in deployment than ever, and the map design is really built around facilitating helicopter play as much as possible. A successful opening air assault has gone from “really good” to “absolutely essential.” Helicopters are much more effective at killing tanks, to the point where the lauded “supertanks” like M1A2 and Chall2 are basically like flushing points down a toilet.","the new factions are fairly successfully designed, and the red dragons in particular are an absolute circus of insane but good boondoggles (really it's a near monopoly on weird units).","insane but good","insane","but",FALSE,"insane but good","good",NA,NA,1,"reddit",0.74339,"thick_non-moral_concepts_NEG","negative",NA,NA,"thick_non-moral_concepts"

"&gt; In your comment, you single out ""normative philosophies and beliefs,"" but my example cited so-called 'hard' scientific evidence.

So Marx thought socialism would happen *whether or not* it was the ""right"" thing.  Interesting.  Slightly insane, but interesting.

&gt; You are perfectly free to question the epistemological superiority of science (as as someone who studies philosophy, I encourage it), but it's a hard road to travel, I assure you, I know from experience.

I don't question the epistemological strength of science.  I don't need to, since as you put it, Marxism was ""scientistic"", not actually scientific.

&gt;From the point of view of Marxism (and science..and philosophy!) this applies the wrong standard. The point is to obtain an objective understanding of the conditions of human flourishing, and precisely not to just let people do whatever. 

The problem is that defining human flourishing is inherently a normative task.

&gt;I'm not sure what you mean by this. If it's that liberalism verges on and may ultimately become nihilism, I agree. This is my main problem with liberalism.

True mental/intellectual freedom is only found in nihilism, in the statement that ""nothing is true, and everything is permitted"" (yes, blatant pop culture reference, but it's been a common-enough sentiment in real history).  This is why I call that kind of freedom a worthless phantasm we shouldn't even bother chasing.","slightly insane, but interesting.  &gt; you are perfectly free to question the epistemological superiority of science (as as someone who studies philosophy, i encourage it), but it's a hard road to travel, i assure you, i know from experience.","insane, but interesting","insane","but",TRUE,"slightly insane , but interesting","interesting","slightly",NA,1,"reddit",0.45217,"thick_non-moral_concepts_NEG","negative",NA,NA,"thick_non-moral_concepts"

"Helmut Kohl.           
He was the most influencial German politician from 1982 to 1998. Chancelor for 16 years! Until he was caught in a donation scandal.        
Admitedly, he was the head of German politics in a time where everything came up roses anyways. That's not to say thing were easy. One of his mayor accomplishments was the reunion of East and West Germany.         
Sure, the Soviet Union could have collapsed under any other politician of the time, had he been chancellor. But Kohl speerheaded this unity, both in person and politicaly. As the first West German politician, he vaccationed in the DDR (East Germany). He also introduced, and pushed through, a 1:1 exchange rate from East to West German currency.            
That's like exchanging Rubel for Dollar. Economically insane, but favourable to our ""long lost cousins"".           
He then even got them covered under the protection of NATO in the 2-on-4-Accord.              
He then set the first steps with France to introduce the Euro.       
Yeah, that was his puppy. This thing that unites all of Europe now was a done deal between him and the French prime minister in the beginning.           
So, after 16 years in power, he literally gets caught with a black suitcase full of ""donation"" money. Where did it come from? Who was influencing German politicians?           
He never said.          
In an outrageous move, Kohl claimed he ""did not remember"" who he had done deals with. The accusation was that international arms dealers had supported his party, on the condition that they would be allowed to trade high quality German arms.            
He was never sentenced, as is ""customary"" with a lot of powerful men. It cost him his political career. But his legacy remains to this day.           
There is another point I'd like to make: People today, they look back at the olden days, and they see economic prosperity, sweeping, positive social changes, the visionary Kohl.           
This was not Kohl's doing, but people have this sentiment that, despite being crooked like a corkscrew, whatever he did ""just made things work"".              
On top of that, he had the balls to take on a commity that could jail him and give them the oldest ""fuck you"" in the playbook. ""I don't remember""? Really?           
And guess what. Guess who is protegee was. Guess who, after learning it all from him, surpassed her master?           
Angela Merkel.            
She's been quietly building her power since her mentor was thrown out, and today, who is the first female chancellor of Germany?          
Her. For 11 years running.

"Truly insightful.

The common individual is not broken or insane, but confused.

As groups we assimilate and act in ways that we never dream of individually. 
It's this lack of congruence that has created the society that we live in. 

A lack of self belief instils a level of reliance and codependance, which in turn reinforces not only our own lack of self worth but that of our leaders.  Our Outlook has turned inward if you will. 

Why would a leader cease to act in a way that hurts others, when the people that he hurts tell him to keep doing it?

On a moral level he/she may know if to be wrong, but we are creatures of habit and not of morals.

If he/she truly understood that he/she was creating pain for others,  then his behaviour would change in an instant. If you think this is incorrect,  ask yourself why. 

The governed are collectively caught in a circle of incongruence. The cycle will continue for as long as a critical mass of individuals(as is the present case) expresses another persons ideas before their own. 

Believing that we are special is a meme, a behavioural program executed within us. It's code so well developed that people seldom ever see its limitations.  The worlds problems are not due to our leaders, or the people. To say this is to merely perpetuate that we are victims and continue the ideas propagation.

Civilized society requires that a new meme takes hold, and this will occur as a natural process. Survival depends on progression. 

A change in environment creates a change in behaviour,  and our current society is saturated to the point that business as usual requires increasing levels of thought effort.  Therefore, our brains will follow the path of least resistance and a new behavioural pattern will reach critical mass.

"This is a kind of tangential answer but...

It comes down to the idea ""what is a right?""

We commonly think that rights are either ""god given"" or derive from our nature as humans. This is actually wrong. Rights are created and removed frequently throughout history.

For example, the right to bear arms traces it's origin to 17th century England (the times of Oliver Cromwell). This right was exported to America with the early settlers. Since then, the right to bear arms has largely been extinguished in England. The right was not god given nor did it arise from anything inherent in being human... it was created and removed by the will of government representing the people (at least ostensibly).

Another example: universal health care. In most of the world this is considered a right, but not in America (at least not yet). If it was obvious that it should be a right, then it wouldn't even be a debate, instead it would be obvious that people should have it, but it's not obvious that people should have universal health care in America, and so the solution is not obvious.


Basically, rights are created and extinguished. We only feel we have a right to something if we've had it for a while and we enjoy it's privileges. There is no ultimate source for rights. They don't come from god, they don't come from being human... they only exist because we are used to having them and would object to having them removed. They are only created when we come to expect a privilege that we have had for a while (e.g. the way universal health care is considered a right in most of the world).

American gun laws are so lenient because access to guns has always been easy in America, so restricting that access would immediately be felt by many in American society.

-Harry doesn’t get control of the company but instead is hired by his dad offscreen as part of special projects

-Harry has no amnesia and only fights Peter once

-Venom has a changed voice

-The day Doc Ock robs the bank, Sandman Robs the truck and later Spider-Man fights the Goblin in the burning building

-Aunt May is not in the hospital

-Norman is not insane but just deranged and wants revenge after being kicked out of his own company

-A lot of the fights were trimmed and the Wrestling Match was removed and only shown in brief moments

-A lot of the goofy dialogue is removed

-John Jameson is not in the edit, nor is Spider-Man no more

-No Harry and MJ love triangle

-Peter only becomes a jerk after the symbiote

-No Gwen and Eddie relationship

-The First movie no longer has that orange tint","some changes include:  -sandman is not ben’s killer  -harry doesn’t get control of the company but instead is hired by his dad offscreen as part of special projects  -harry has no amnesia and only fights peter once  -venom has a changed voice  -the day doc ock robs the bank, sandman robs the truck and later spider-man fights the goblin in the burning building  -aunt may is not in the hospital  -norman is not insane but just deranged and wants revenge after being kicked out of his own company  -a lot of the fights were trimmed and the wrestling match was removed and only shown in brief moments  -a lot of the goofy dialogue is removed  -john jameson is not in the edit, nor is spider-man no more  -no harry and mj love triangle  -peter only becomes a jerk after the symbiote  -no gwen and eddie relationship  -the first movie no longer has that orange tint","insane but just","insane","but",FALSE,"insane but just deranged","deranged",NA,"just",1,"reddit",-0.34088,"thick_non-moral_concepts_NEG","negative",0.39079,NA,"thick_non-moral_concepts"

"What a response! Thank you for the time you took to put this together. :)

&gt; For the 41 capital crimes that exist at a federal level there is not much of a chance for the person to be rehabilitated their actions have deemed them not capable of living in society safely.

I agree here in terms of rehabilitation and capability of reintegration, I just don't believe that they necessarily deserve this opportunity. They can live on in prison and possibly aim to spread a message of regret of their actions and enforce a positive image towards others from, perhaps, similar backgrounds susceptible to be driven to a similar path. I don't think freedom after their crimes is a desirable outcome, and serves as a harsher deterrent.

&gt; Life in prison isn't torture. Its not great but for some people thats a better option than being on the outside. 

This is sadly the case for many abused peoples and the homeless, though they mainly commit misdemeanours in order to get off the streets/away from family for a while. I think that social welfare needs drastic strides forward in order to prevent people from seeking prison as a better option that their live in society.

&gt; Death isn't the deterrent it's the punishment. You cant lump the two together or else you are going to get some mixed concepts thrown in. If that was the issue than you would have lawyers pleading insanity, but its a defense that rarely works because it is a hard thing to prove a person is that out of touch with reality. There are some people that are actually just bad people, not just insane, but willfully bad people.

Definitely agree, apologies for the horrendous wording I used. I believe that death is a deterrent for all, but not necessarily a punishment for all (martyrdom). You do get a lot of lawyers pleading insanity however, and some are genuine victims of insane mental conditions. Even if they are willfully bad, is it not a harsher punishment for them to live a restricted life filled with loneliness and boredom at the absolute least? 

&gt; But thats not how prisons work. You aren't just confined with people of similar crimes. Many of the lifers in prisons often do hits inside anyways. These criminals are people too and its a bit of cognitive dissonance to say that its okay to keep the dangerous criminals with those people because you know they are already criminals deserving less protection from crimes anyways.

Hmm, this is very true. The burden of proof isn't being laid on you here, but what do you view as an alternative? (I have to award a ∆ here, because I am truly stumped.)

&gt; Many of the innocent people that are convicted get let off and paid reparations, but you cant assume that tons and tons of these people are innocent. 4% is already pretty low and the burden of proof and evidence for these crimes are pretty high. Capital cases get the full weight of the legal system thrown at them, including far more appeals than most other cases ever get.

True, but it's still a harsh margin considering the amount of cases and the fact that innocent lives are concerned. And reparations will never make up for that time, I don't think. Even if the full legal system is used, the absence of some conclusive evidence that proves their innocence isn't covered by judicial realms unfortunately. (such as multiple eye-witnesses perhaps not coming forward, etc)

&gt; We aren't at war with criminals criminals are transgressing normative social an legal bounds within their own society. Wars are a totally different kettle of fish. Wars you can have multiple endgames crimes you only have one, restoring social order.

I can't agree with this, although you're correct that the bounds are completely different, if the serial killer puts himself in exile in another country and never kills again, social order is restored, but is it a justifiable outcome? What if it is a war criminal that has fled from custody? I think that although warzones and domestic crime are worlds apart, the two have to have be applied to similar rules due to both of these circumstances perhaps leading to possible death sentences.","there are some people that are actually just bad people, not just insane, but willfully bad people.","insane, but willfully","insane","but",TRUE,"just insane , but willfully bad","bad","just","willfully",1,"reddit",-0.46292,"thick_non-moral_concepts_NEG","negative",NA,0.39079,"thick_non-moral_concepts"

"I had a bit of a pause there, too. 
But I studied German and English and I knew I wanted to go into diachronic linguistics, but I still had to do literary studies for my BA. So I went to my classes and decided for myself: I'll learn it. And I'll use it for fanfiction!
That's how I motivated myself. Now I still write as a way to take time off. 
Fanfiction is just an amazing thing, if you want to try some crazy things you learned in class. You don't have to establish characters or do much world building. You can just go crazy!

Maybe find a way to utilize writing for your studies, too? What are you studying?

*Bayonetta + Bayonetta 2 (Do you like action games? Do you like Devil May Cry? You NEED to get these, Bayonetta 1 is at its best on Wii U and Bayonetta 2 is an exclusive AND they come together!)

*Hyrule Warriors [Dynasty Warriors + Zelda, HUGE amounts of content, if you don't know anything about Musou games you're basically a powerful leader unit (Zelda, Link, Impa, Wizzrobe and other well known characters) that smashes around hordes of bad guy soldiers and duels with enemy ""officers"" (other important characters) look up musou games and if you think they're your thing, definitely get this]

*The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker HD (If you've never played the original this is worth the investment, the Wind Waker is an amazing iteration in the Legend of Zelda series that has you exploring the great ocean, a new concept that I think was executed very well)

*Mario Kart 8 (Best Mario Kart to date, has the best example of DLC in recent memory, only 1 criticism and that is that the battle mode is sort of meh, it's basically just regular stages with the battle element, there are no ""arenas"", however this is a phenomenal game that over 50% of Wii U owners have, the online is robust and very active, can't recommend it enough really)

*Pikmin 3 (The best RTS series off of PC gaming, nuff said if you don't know about Pikmin, look into the first two!)

*Splatoon (One of the games of the year. This game is fantastic, it's a competitive shooter but if you're not the competitive type don't feel too worried, it's a blast for more casual players and highly skilled ones. You don't need to worry if your aim isn't so good because you can bring value to your team just by painting the stage! I cannot recommend this game enough, it's so unique and there aren't really other games like it at the moment)

*Super Mario Maker (Amazing concept, very vibrant community. I will say that there are many levels that are painful to play because of how easy it is to upload them but don't be discouraged! The game allows you to skip them when doing the random-level 100 Mario Mode and you never have to complete a level that is painful, if you're the creative type this game has all kinds of ways of flexing that and its getting updates to its content going forward)

*Super Smash Bros. (Nintendo's take on fighting games, well established, very controversial at times. There's not much I can say, if you're not familiar with Smash this is a great way to get into it, best with other friends but has online play)

*The Wonderful 101 (Underrated game, it's challenging to break into because of the control method, but if you want an action-packed beat em' up style game that makes terrific use of the gamepad and is completely unique in execution you owe it to yourself to try it out)
https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbCOGQCF6GO0HsY1zfxStGA1Ou-7Fj6AN


*Yoshi's Woolly World (Stunning game, it's the true sequel to Yoshi's Island that people have wanted for a long time, aesthetics are great, collectables are well incorporated and the challenge is perfect and customizable)

*Art of Balance (Digital only, very simple puzzle game but I find it relaxing)

*Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze (Amazing game, if you have ever liked a Donkey Kong Country game, you have to get this, some of the best platforming experiences in years)

*New Super Mario Bros. U + New Super Luigi U (Best NSMB game, builds on the formula, very polished)

*Affordable Space Adventures (Digital only, great indie shooter style game that makes great use of the gamepad)

*Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker (You will get a taste of this game in Super Mario 3D world, the Captain Toad levels are the format for this game)

*Kirby and the Rainbow Curse (A more laid back title, nothing insane but very charming and the style of gameplay is very unique)

*NES Remix Pack (Big collection of NES games with new ""challenges"")

*Pushmo World (Fantastic puzzle game, look up Pushmo in general to learn how it works more properly)

*Fatal Frame: Oracle of the Sodden Raven (A great addition to a Japanese horror series, digital only in North America very sadly and limited physical release in Europe that likely can't be secured anymore)

*Shovel Knight (Physical version, probably the best example of a new game that successfully emulates classic NES gameplay)

******Future Titles******

*Rodea the Sky Soldier (Nov. 10)

*Xenoblade Chronicles: X (Dec. 4)

*Star Fox Zero (Q1 2016)

*Fast Racing Neo (2016)

*The Legend of Zelda U (2016?)

*Pokken Tournament (Q2 2016)

*Shin Megami Tensei X Fire Emblem (2016)

"I guess the ""new thing"" is to chelate out the ""heavy metals,"" but the older school of thought is that you can remove some of your iron.

Interestingly, although the mechanism is whack, the idea itself isn't that bad; iron overload is clearly bad: we know what happens to those with idiopathic hemochromatosis, and it's not good. The solution is easy enough: get some blood taken out now and again. The same mechanism may be why pre-menopausal women don't have the heart disease risk of age-matched men, but they quickly catch up after menopause.

However, now that humans don't fight (and bleed) quite so much anymore, and that we're now virtually devoid of endoparasites, the iron in the blood doesn't ""turn over"" quite so much. This may in part be responsible for some heart disease that we see. A few investigators have looked at the benefits of blood donation in those without disorders like hemochromatosis, and the data can kind of (sort of) be interpreted that being a blood donor *might* cause one to live longer.

Federal agents are allowed to enforce federal laws in states. In this case, they're invoking defending the destruction of federal property (which would be a crime).

The second is that agencies like CBP have broad authority anywhere within 100 miles of the border (including oceans), to enforce border security. 

The problem with the first one is that they're clearly going beyond just defending the buildings themselves. That doesn't give them the ability to arrest protesters and the like.

The second is likely legal (SCOTUS came up with the 100mi limit), and it's been a huge problem. 100 miles of any border in the US is basically most of the US, including basically every major city. It's insane but legal.

Those laws also just allow them to operate, though. Even in cases where they're legally there, they're still not supposed to be violating things like due process (which grabbing people suspected of protesting is a violation).

There's a good chance some of this will eventually be ruled illegal. The problem is the time/effort it takes, and this is still going on. Unless a judge gives an injuction, it could be a while. And in a lot of cases, even if it's illegal, the result is basically the courts telling the government ""you can't do this"", and that's about it.","it's insane but legal.","insane but legal","insane","but",FALSE,"insane but legal","legal",NA,NA,1,"reddit",0.03732,"thick_non-moral_concepts_NEG","negative",NA,NA,"thick_non-moral_concepts"

mod your weapons for lower VATS costs and more crit damage (reflex sights, short barrels, severe or snappy receivers)

Look for instigating weapons (.308 combat rifle would be ideal, good damage, and very low AP cost in VATS for a semi auto rifle). If you need more damage, a gauss rifle will be insane, but slow. In close range, a combat rifle will do wonder, you don't even need shotgun perks. Anti Armour is going to be nice late game, and you could also get the +30% dmg vs. creature types you don't like (maybe +10% players or Zealot if it works vs. scorchbeasts). I found that aiming for the right part with concentrated fire does more than enough dmg. (head, belly, fusions core, face, combat inhibitor, thruster...)

Because of the way armour works, you'll always get more out of semi auto weapons. If you shoot a single 100 dmg bullet at a 100 armour, you'll deal 50. If you shoot two 50 dmg bullets (same damage out of your muzzle) you'll only deal 20x2 dmg. 50% mitigation vs. 61.1% (one of the many reasons Instigating wins vs. Two Shot in burst dps builds).

It's more or less the build I run, and I one-shot most targets. (does great for the durability of your weapons and ammo consumption too).

Chameleon on one or two armour piece will be enough to get sneak bonus on most shots.

A Medic’s weapon can be fun in team, since you crit most shots.

"You are not intolerant in the Sam Harris way. Pay attention to the way Sam Harris speaks. No, he doesn't give undeserved respect to religious belief, but he also goes out of his way to treat individuals with respect. He will refer to their views as deranged and insane, but he won't call individuals pathetic or idiotic. I appreciate you spreading Sam Harris links; many of us who have been fighting this fight for years find Harris to be an inspiring and intelligent individual. But your attitude (below, not above, for confused followers of this exchange) is nothing like that of Sam Harris.

What he does is speak his mind about beliefs. In the very video you link to, you notice he compares belief in religion to belief that Elvis is alive. Would you treat Elvis believers the same way you treat religious people, calling them idiots and assholes and pathetic people? Perhaps you would, but Harris wouldn't and I wouldn't. Sam Harris and I would both look at that belief and say ""That's absurd. Why do you believe that?""

None of Harris, Dennet, or Dawkins would dream of treating people the way you do. Hitchens would, of course, but don't think for a second that Hitchens is trying to convert religious people. He is serving a rather valuable purpose, in giving atheists a focal celebrity who shares their views publicly and isn't ashamed of them-- similar to what Sarah Palin is doing for certain people on the right, only are views aren't batshit crazy. Like Palin, Hitchens is energizing and polarizing, but also like Palin, does much more to drive moderates and indecisive people away from his cause than towards it.

"I don't think I'll be asking him to stop drinking anytime soon.  He has a very careful schedule he keeps to and as I mentioned elsewhere on here back in the 70's he was pronounced incurable.  So I'm kind of afraid to suggest any changes.  He's had schizophrenia for over 40 years now (he's nearly 60).

He has mentioned he still hears a lot of things (I'm not sure about seeing things, he likes to make jokes about seeing things but we can never tell how serious he is).  I'd imagine what you're saying about the radio is true for him.  It seems like the evenings are his coping time and he gets irritable if it's too changed.  It took us a while to realize it, but the few times he offered to stay up late to do something with us actually meant a lot more to him than we realized.  Mostly because he was changing his schedule, I think.  He talk to the devil on the phone a lot, that's the only character he's told us about.  He realizes it's fake, but seems to have fun bantering with him.

In general I'm really impressed with him.  I mean, he says a lot of things that could be hurtful if you didn't realize he just has a weird sense of humor.  But what impresses me is he actually raised a daughter alone.  His ex-wife went crazy and now lives with her father, she had no actual mental disorder.  In fact, he told her about some of his hallucinations and she believes they are true (talking to the devil) and even tried to get Rachel put into foster care because her father was ""talking to the devil.""  I guess she's given me a big appreciation for him.  She isn't crazy and completely and utterly failed as a parent...he technically is crazy, but (and though he wasn't a great parent, often distant and paranoid she was lying to him) he actually provided a stable house for my wife to grow up in and is fairly well to do in general (actually better than my parents, again not insane but bankrupt and abusive).

I guess that's what gives me my amazement at the human mind, that he can talk to the devil his entire life (among other hallucination) but still lead a fairly normal and constructive life.  It sounds like you're doing the same.  Imagine that you're able to have so many characters stored in your head so realistically and on top of all that you're able to function (I'm assuming) well as a normal human being.  It's not like part of you was taken away by the characters, they were added on top of the normal functions.

If you don't mind me asking, and this is just out of interest, could you describe some of the characters you have?  What's the point of the medication, does it reduce the hallucination or does it mostly help you realize they're fake?  What medication are you on now?  Is it hard to find personal alone time?  I mean, with the characters voices intruding is it frustrating to not be able to get silence?  Or are the characters silent much of the time?","she isn't crazy and completely and utterly failed as a parent...he technically is crazy, but (and though he wasn't a great parent, often distant and paranoid she was lying to him) he actually provided a stable house for my wife to grow up in and is fairly well to do in general (actually better than my parents, again not insane but bankrupt and abusive).","insane but bankrupt","insane","but",FALSE,"insane but bankrupt","bankrupt",NA,NA,1,"reddit",-0.64515,"thick_non-moral_concepts_NEG","negative",NA,NA,"thick_non-moral_concepts"
