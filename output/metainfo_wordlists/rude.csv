"It would have been very simple for her roommate to tell her ""Yeah, I plan on having some people over and a couple of them might crash on the couch, so don't freak if someone's sleeping out here tomorrow.""

But to wake up to a stranger in your house can be a little alarming for anyone, let alone a small woman. 

I grew up with 3 older brothers and many parties were had and there were tons of times when I'd wake up to dudes on couches, but my brothers were also home, so I didn't feel I needed to be afraid. 

Her roommate left her alone with a stranger, and it made her uncomfortable in her own home. That's not only rude, but potentially dangerous.

"Your response to that quote of Dr Howell's is fallacious, an *argumentum ad hominem*. Is what that paragraph says wrong? You're side-stepping it completely and simply attacking the man.

With regard to ""antipodal"" evidence, you have used the correct term if you are from the northern hemisphere. My friend is not ""lactase"" intolerant; rather it is because he cannot produce his own lactase that he is *lactose* intolerant. The FDA's ""information point #8"" is disingenuous: while pasteurised milk certainly doesn't *cause* lactose intolerance, it can most certainly make life temporarily miserable for those without the genetic ability to manufacture lactase. The FDA is diverting attention from the question that should have been posed: ""Can drinking pasteurized milk cause issues for people with lactose intolerance?"" The answer to that question is, of course, a resounding *yes*.

If you were confused and wished to speak of anecdotal evidence, I would comment that while anecdotal evidence does not make something true, it also does not make something false either. Anecdotal evidence can be rated as to its reliability by: 1)  the number of eyewitnesses, testimonials and claims; 2)  the consistency of the observations and claims; 3)  the credibility of the witnesses; 4)  the clarity of and proximity of the observation; and 5)  The state of mind of the witnesses. Bearing these in mind, I have confidence in the anecdotal evidence of my friend and his family about pasteurised milk causing him discomfort. The FDA's ""information point #8"", that pasteurised milk doesn't cause lactose intolerance I would also be pretty confident in, since I'm of the understanding that the inability of someone to produce their own lactase is genetic, and not caused by the milk. But the FDA's point addresses a different issue, so your use of it to attempt to imply my friend is a liar is not only rude, but erroneous as well.

Re your remark on shelf life, I was not comparing shelf life at all. If that subject interests you, then feel free to look into it. If keeping milk around for long periods is more important to you than freshness, there's always the unrefrigerated dead ultra-pasteurised milk that stores well in its box for six months or more. 

&gt;*I guess I can see how you would feel that it should be your right*

If not an individual's right to choose what he eats, are you saying then with the ""FDA taking steps"" that a US Federal government organisation instead has the right to decide what food citizens put in their mouths? Please, can you point me to the paragraph in the US Constitution where this right over food choice is granted to the government? Not being from the USA, this authoritarian concept I find surprising and shocking.

If you feel happy trusting the Federal Disinformation Agency, I wish you the very [best of luck](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB120225742208745785.html), as their food monitoring is reportedly [sketchy](http://www.cspinet.org/new/200707171.html) and their drug advice tends to kill and harm a lot of people. Ask the estimated [60,000](http://www.drugresearcher.com/Research-management/Whistleblowers-reveal-FDA-exacerbated-Vioxx-scandal) [Vioxx](http://www.naturalnews.com/011401_Dr_David_Graham_the_FDA.html) victims.. oh, sorry, you can't (but there are apparently some [9,200 lawsuits you can look for](http://www.lawyersandsettlements.com/articles/00118/fda.html)). [Rezulin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rezulin), [Ketek](http://www.lawyersandsettlements.com/articles/00680/ketek-scandal.html), [cancer drugs](http://www.lawyersandsettlements.com/articles/01635/provenge.html), are just some interesting reads. Some others include a 2009 report of some FDA scientists [who stated](http://www.healthcarepackaging.com/archives/2009/01/fda_scandal_bursts_but_quietly.php) the FDA is ""fundamentally broken,"" and ""corrupted and distorted by current FDA managers, thereby placing the American people at risk."" As recently as July 2010 the FDA is hard at work protecting industry, making sure that the drug [Avandia](http://www.foodconsumer.org/newsite/Non-food/Drug/diabetes_drug_avandia_should_stay_on_the_market_1607100206.html), which may raise heart attack probability by 43%, stays on the market.

You yourself resort to anecdotal evidence in quoting four news articles (two of which are about the same story). If you've ever known the truth of an incident and then seen it presented in the media, you would know that it's possible for stories to have an ""angle"" which can portray events in a particular light. But let's look at these ""resent"" (sent again?) articles more closely.. 

* ""Illness halts"" &amp; ""15 Fall Ill"" - the latter article on Alexandre Family EcoDairy Farms is brief and slanted, but the former is longer and includes illuminating details. The health department officer stated the food poisoning ""*appeared* to come from the same source"".. but this does not sound conclusive. [It's reported](http://www.triplicate.com/2008081696352/News/Local-News/Illness-halts-raw-milk-progra) that the farm owner, 

&gt;""Alexandre also questions whether the Campylobacter came from his farm. *He said he spoke to a person who is listed by the county health department as contracting the infection who said he didn't even drink raw milk during the time of the outbreak.*"". ""Campylobacter can be contracted through eating undercooked meats or by drinking water that has been contaminated by Campylobacter, such as if animal faeces with the bacteria in it was in contact with the water. ""

In other words, as soon as raw milk was found to be in a victim's diet, the search for a culprit unscientifically stopped, and guilt was established by assumption. If you take a look at [this old CDC chart](http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00044241.htm#00002040.htm) I was able to find, in 1989 you were more likely to contract food poisoning from fruit &amp; vegetables, ham, salad and beef than from milk. Of the 48 cases listed for milk, it's not broken down into pasteurised and non-pasteurised products, but we can assume some of each would be in there. Even though your Bnet article suggests the figure for raw milk is higher at almost 200 in 2002, can the claim be trusted if statistics are generated by assumptions such as seems to be the case in the Alexandre Family EcoDairy Farms incident.

* The ""[Boulder county"" article](http://www.coloradodaily.com/ci_15422954#axzz0tsnxJETv) mentions at the end that 60 raw milk dairies exist in Colorado and that claimed food poisoning at just 2 dairies has affected just 36 people in the last 5 years. Assuming the claims are correct, these are pretty small numbers, and nobody's died - it's not another Vioxx scandal, by any means. I'd be interested to find out the food poisoning data for pasteurised dairy and other products in Colorado for some context.

* The Fiji Times story ""Dairy Farms under quarantine"" is about bovine brucellosis (the bovine strain has been eradicated in Australia, just as a point of passing interest). There, with the fourth paragraph all to itself, is the statement 

&gt;""Boiling of raw milk does not kill the pathogen bacteria"" 

What were you trying to prove with this article? Don't you know that pasteurisation is just heating milk to 72C for 15-20 seconds, and not boiling it? If subjecting milk to higher temperature by boiling isn't going to kill the brucellosis pathogen, then what use do you think pasteurisation would be? None at all, obviously!

It's sad to see how, in the last century, fear propaganda has turned people away from foods that nourished the human race for time out of mind and allowed it to flourish, and directed them towards nutrient-depleted, artificial, and low-value substitutes; which have seen the rates of heart disease, cancer, diabetes, obesity, osteoporosis, arthritis, and other chronic diseases keep increasing, despite advances in medical science. Something is very wrong with official food and [medical](http://www.wnd.com/index.php?pageId=41256) advice, and more and more [people are realising it](http://www4.dr-rath-foundation.org/pharmaceutical_business/pharmaceutical_industry.htm), notwithstanding strident attempts to maintain the economically profitable status quo.","but the fda's point addresses a different issue, so your use of it to attempt to imply my friend is a liar is not only rude, but erroneous as well.","rude, but erroneous","rude","but",TRUE,"only rude , but erroneous","erroneous","only",NA,1,"reddit",-0.15207,"thick_moral_concepts_NEG","negative",NA,0,"thick_moral_concepts"

"Quoting /u/todoloqueentiendo 

Ron gets more shit than nearly any other character in the series but I think he's wonderful.
First Year: Generally people complain that he made Hermione cry and said she had no friends and other mean things. He was right though. Hermione was being a stuck up bitch and what he said was mean and rude but at the end of the day she humiliated him and he reacted like an 11 year old. But he made it up to her, he fought a troll to save her and then became her friend. At the end of the year he sacrificed himself, frankly risking death, in order that Harry and Hermione can go on with no thought to his own safety.
Second Year: Now Ron has spent his whole life being told Slytherins are evil and parseltoungue=dark magic. Yet when his best friend is caught speaking the language and is widely believed to be Slytherins heir, being bullied in the corridors, does he abandon him? No of course not, he's too loyal. Then at the end of the year he goes to fight Slytherins monster because his friend and sister were hurt, facing death for the ones he loves.
Third Year: Hermione was a bitch and went behind their backs about the broom, didn't even think to mention that she went to speak to McGonagall. She was also wrong about it being cursed as much as she was right about it being from Sirius. She also was heartless about Scabbers (idgaf that he was Wormtail, she was still heartless about her cat having ""killed"" his pet). Ron again reacts normally,hurt by his friend but he can't stay mad for long and ultimately forgives her. End of the year Ron stands up to what he believes is a mass murderer ""if you want to kill Harry you'll have to kill me too"". He's also there for Harry all year when a murderer is trying to kill him, not even when Sirius ""almost kills"" him with a knife in the dorms does he try and distance himself from Harry. He stands by his friend.
Fourth Year: This is the only thing I have against him, shitty thing to do but I can still understand it, he believes Harry put his name in the Goblet. Imagine you're Ron though. You spend weeks dreaming that maybe you'll be picked for the tournament, yeah you're underage but maybe just maybe you'll get to shine for once publicly and do something none of your brothers got to do, make your Mum proud and hey maybe Hermione will notice...she's been getting cute lately. But nah it's your famous bff. He reacts like a normal teenager. You know what though? End of the year there's not one doubt in his mind about Harry saying that Voldemorts back despite much less evidence.
Fifth Year: They were right not to write to him, one wrong word could have been a disaster for the Order. Harry was being a child, they were at war and couldn't risk any sensitive information being leaked. He spends the entire year supporting Harry being a little bitch, he defies the ministry and trains for the fight ahead mastering magic many adults cant do (on that note his Patronus? A dog. Loyal to a fault). End of the year he goes to fight Death Eaters at the ministry because his friend had a dream and he knew fighting Voldemort (who he thought would be there) was the right thing to do.
Sixth Year: He is nothing but a good friend. He even does the mature thing and hooks up with Lavender because he accepts nothings happening with Hermione. Also, at this point he knows his best friend is prophesied to kill or be killed by the most powerful dark wizard in history. Does he run away? Nope, he duels said dark wizards followers at the end of the year and pledges his loyalty to Harry on what seems like an impossible mission.
Seventh Year: So Harry has no family and Hermione hides hers in Australia with no one noticing cause their muggles, grand. Ron on the other hand by the time he leaves for the hunt has one earless brother and another mauled by a werewolf. He doesn't have to go, Hermione and Harry can't go back to Hogwarts cause mudblood and chosen one. Ron can. Ginny does, Neville does, Luna does. Ron goes on the hunt anyway, putting himself and his family at risk. He's also human and worries about them, then they get a Horcrux, great.
By this point his sister has been in a Death Eater ran school for 3 months and 2 of his brothers are being hunted for taking a stand and his whole family is under surveillance, (this is especially worrying as they are involved in a long term lie about him being sick). If they are caught they will be tortured into insanity and killed. He still goes because he knows it is the right thing to do. He also goes without a clear idea of what is going to happen but he goes because he knows his friend has a plan, except he has no fucking clue.
Then the Horcrux plays on all of this and he snaps and in a moment of weakness, after hearing his sister was punished at the school she is trapped in ran by Death Eaters and no one but him even pauses to think about it, Harry tells him to go and he does. He immediately regrets it and tried to go back but Harry and Hermione have already left, it's not his fault they didn't wait and he couldn't find them.
He eventually comes back, after being completely off the hook, saves Harry's life and destroys a Horcrux, overcoming his insecurities and completing the growth of the most compelling character arcs in the books. The scenes with the mirror in The Philosophers Stone, when Harry catches him sneaking out to practice Quidditch and the horcrux lays out every problem with Ron perfectly; his insecurities about his family, not being good enough for his mother, the girl he loves preferring his friend, being the weak member of the group. The Horcrux then throws all this and more back at him...so he stabs it in the face. Because he has finally realised he is good enough, that he does have value and that he should be happy with who he is.
We also see a notable change in him from this point on. He is much more confidant and calm, he gets Hermione and is able to be possibly the most valuable he has been in the entire series.
He then goes on to help destroy 2/3 remaining horcruxes, fights in the Battle of Hogwarts and is one of only three people to directly stare down Voldemort and defy him (""He beat you"") and continues to fight for what is right, even knowing Harry is dead and being one of only two people who knew the prophecy he actually thought the fight was futile at that point but he kept going because it was the right thing to do.
Ron is the heart of the trio, he's the only one who shows true character growth in a realistic manner. Sure he makes mistakes but he overcomes them and ultimately becomes a better person for it. He can be insensitive at times but he more than makes up for it by being the most loyal and decent person in the series.","hermione was being a stuck up bitch and what he said was mean and rude but at the end of the day she humiliated him and he reacted like an 11 year old.","mean and rude","rude","but",FALSE,"mean and rude","mean",NA,NA,0,"reddit",-0.6657,"thick_moral_concepts_NEG","negative",NA,NA,"thick_moral_concepts"

1.
&gt;Yes, annoying marketing people in some parts of the world would like you to think that ""LED TV"" means LED-backlit LCD.

2.
&gt; semiconductor LED displays are still pretty uncommon in consumer applications

3.
&gt; Dark mode is often harder on your battery unless you're using an LED-based display


1.
That is *exactly* what a TV marketed as an “LED TV” is.

2.
Consumer LED displays are not “uncommon.” Consumer LED displays don’t exist (yet).

3.
Naw, buddy. Dark mode is easier if the electroluminescent element in your display is an LED. The only consumer displays containing LEDs are LCDs backlit by those LEDs. In other words, by definition only “LED-based displays” are backlit by said LEDs. See again your comment:

&gt; Dark mode is often harder on your battery unless you're using an LED-based display

When a display is *backlit* by LEDs—in other words, a display with driven LEDs as an electroluminescent layer behind a tinted liquid crystal layer—we call that an LCD. This type of display *uses* LEDs, to be sure and it uses them in combination with a second driven element: an LCD. A **l**iquid **c**rystal **d**isplay.

The electroluminescent layer (you might call this a “lightbulb”) is an LED. It creates light. Like a [lightbulb](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ).

That light shines through a tinted liquid crystal transistor layer which causes that light to appear as one of three (sometimes four) colors.

In this design, “black” takes more energy than “white” (which is not really white, but I’m not going in to the different ways to create the perception of “white”) because we need the liquid crystal layer to turn [on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) to [obscure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) or [block](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) the backlight completely. When the backlight is blocked, you perceive no color, therefore “black”. (Or close to it). When a device is [on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) it generally consumes more energy than when that device is [off](https://www.pornhub.com].

I’ll put that *another* way in case you need an ELI2 instead of an ELI5: when the liquid crystal layer creates an image through reflectivity or tint, white is the *easiest* color to make because the liquid crystal layer is “off” and you can see the light behind it. That light is white. Easy things take less energy to do. Therefore displaying the color white uses less energy than any color that requires obstruction of the backlight.

OLEDs need no backlight. Each pixel is itself an electroluminescent element. Therefore we can organize many OLEDs in such a way that they create a cohesive, driven, display. Each OLED becomes a pixel coordinate in that larger display.

In order to create the appearance of “black” in a display comprised of many electroluminescent pixels, we can simply turn the pixel at a specific coordinate off. That makes the “easiest” color for a display of this design to produce black; a “black” pixel is an “off.” Things that are “easier” take less energy than things that are not easy—or [hard](http://www.pornhub.com)—if you will. Therefore a display comprised of OLEDs will use significantly less energy when displaying black than when displaying any other color.

Note again that this is the opposite of the way an LED backlit display operates. Therefore your assertion that dark mode is harder when using an LED based display—and your rude comment that I should feel

&gt;sad about correcting someone that's already correct

is not only rude, but laughable, as you were quite incorrect. Indeed your explanation conflated LED, LCD, and even OLED many times over.","therefore your assertion that dark mode is harder when using an led based display—and your rude comment that i should feel  &gt;sad about correcting someone that's already correct  is not only rude, but laughable, as you were quite incorrect.","rude, but laughable","rude","but",TRUE,"only rude , but laughable","laughable","only",NA,1,"reddit",0.28011,"thick_moral_concepts_NEG","negative",NA,0,"thick_moral_concepts"

&gt;No, the scumbag was just [lumping together ""they"" and ""xir""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equivocation) in order to force people to choose between ""he"" and ""she"". Do you think university administrators were (or should be) stupid enough to fall for his pathetic excuses?

&gt;Q. Will “gender identity” and “gender expression” be defined in the Bill?

&gt;A. In order to ensure that the law would be as inclusive as possible, the terms “gender identity” and “gender expression” are not defined in the Bill. With very few exceptions, grounds of discrimination are not defined in legislation but are left to courts, tribunals, and commissions to interpret and explain, based on their detailed experience with particular cases.

&gt;Definitions of the terms “gender identity” and “gender expression” have already been given by the Ontario Human Rights Commission, for example. The Commission has provided helpful discussion and examples that can offer good practical guidance. The Canadian Human Rights Commission will provide similar guidance on the meaning of these terms in the Canadian Human Rights Act.

The creators of the bill itself admit they will not clarify the issue and leave it up to be interpreted, however they do say that gender neutral pronouns must be used when requested. They do note clarify on what constitutes a gender neutral pronoun. 

Furthermore, we can look at the cited example of a body who gets to interprets the law, the OHRC:

http://www.ohrc.on.ca/en/gender-identity-and-gender-expression-brochure

&gt;Gender expression is how a person publicly presents their gender. This can include behaviour and outward appearance such as dress, hair, make-up, body language and voice. A person’s chosen name and **pronoun are also common ways of expressing gender.**

I find no further clarification. They do not list a set of valid or nonvalid gender pronouns anywhere I can find. They list ""they"" as a valid gender neutral pronoun because it is in the Oxford dictionary, that is the extent of the clarification. 

With that being said, it is hard for me to find an argument that pronouns like xir and other such nonsense aren't included under this law. Until such clarification is made than the argument stands. Also, even if there is a set list of gender neutral pronouns it doesn't mean this law is just. It still doesn't justify gender neutral pronouns but still compells speech. 


&gt;&gt; On him being angry and bitter I don't really see it.
&gt;
&gt;Because people well above your age tend to know how to hide that in order to avoid being perceived as emotionally vulnerable?
&gt;
&gt;The term ""passive-aggressive"" exists in social vernacular for a pretty good reason, you know.

This is both incredibly patronizing and borderline hypocritical, considering you're already flirting with being passive aggressive with me. However, I'd say your being plainly aggressive by the end, although only mildly aggressive. I am going to ask you to stop. 

Also, I don't see him as being passive aggressive to a significant extent. 

&gt;&gt; I've seen interviews where he gets very passionate but I've never seen him be outright mean or nasty to someone. 
&gt;
&gt;Maybe you should consider taking off your rose-coloured spectacles whenever Dr. Zoidberg starts blathering about abolishing gender studies or speaking bitterly of bogeymen on ""the left"" with [Stefan Molyneux](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOScYBwMyAA)?

I'm not watching a 45 minute video, but I see no connection between this and Jordan Peterson. I just see Molyneux stating some shit that is probably false or a misrepresentation and making a title with a blatantly false assertion that certainly goes against Peterson's beliefs, seeing as treating mental disease is his actual profession and he talks about it constantly. 

&gt;&gt; Lastly, the article you cited may be very well made and accurate but considering you've done nothing to tie it into anything Peterson has said I don't really feel any need to address it, it's completely off subject. 
&gt;
&gt;The guy was literally attempting to justify his argument on human behaviour with *lobster physiology*. Are you really this wilfully ignorant of just how big a delusional crank he is?

No, the argument is that hierarchies have existed throughout almost every species we have evolved from, and even existed as far back as lobsters. The argument he is making is that it is so ingrained into our biology that even ancestors who we broke off with hundreds of millions of years ago have it, and our closest cousins the chimpanzees have it, and we have it. Hierarchies are something that we evolved to create, and we can't just get rid of them any more than we can get rid of fear or sadness. That's why he argues in favor of structuring society in a way that our hierarchies are as fair as reasonably possible, because it is the best we can ever hope to do.

The assertion that he believes human psychology is the same as lobsters is incorrect and intellectual dishonest. All it is is pointing our that we evolved to be hierarchical and not much else.

So. Want the help doing what your trying to do, or the answer why it’s not working for you? Excellent, put the pee-pee away, I don’t care about it’s size, and get down to business. 

I came from construction to tech support work (Verizon contract) back in 08 after the crash, and one of my first calls after 3 days of super inadequate training was this dude who thought he was gods gift to everything. 08 was the heyday of blackberry’s, and usually a good restart fixes them.... but no joke, it could take 20 Minutes to power off and another 20 to power back on, and some settings changes required multiple restarts between steps, so I get the dude’s reluctance to restart. Anyway, the call starts off with douchey mcdoucherson telling me how important he is, and how important his company is (never heard of either him or the company before, so how important could he be?) and how this gawdam piece of donkey shit was going to be replaced with a brand new phone right now. 

Except his problem was fixable with a restart. A simple restart. So I tell him that, and he lost his shit. Demanded a supervisor. Now, i was hired as a T2, and i was feeling like maybe I shouldn’t have been, cause I had no experience in call centers, and didn’t yet know that my call center was a super shitty call center, so I tried to get a supervisor when the dude demanded one, but was refused... i was told that they wouldn’t take an escalated call and to de-escalate any way i can. I will never forget this conversation: 

“you listen here you little shit! I went to (school I’d never heard of) and payed over $500,000 for my degree! I now make more in a MONTH than you do in a fucking YEAR! I will NOT restart this fucking phone! You will send me a new one NOOOOWWWW!”

How rude, but funny... I’m mad at the disrespect, but not like raging mad... more like incredulously annoyed.

“Wow! How exciting for you! But no, we won’t be sending you a new phone. This is the step, and this is what we’ll do.”

Now a bit madder

“Yeah, great job at school and career choices bud, your parents must be proud! But you called me.... I didn’t call you. So if you want to fix the phone, we will. If you want a new one, we won’t, and if you want to disconnect the call, that would be fine too. My coffee is getting cold, and I have break after this.... so it’s up to you”

“Fine, we’ll restart it. Once. And if this doesn’t fix it, you WILL send me a new phone.”

We restarted, it fixed the problem, and we disconnect the call.

1.
&gt;Yes, annoying marketing people in some parts of the world would like you to think that ""LED TV"" means LED-backlit LCD.

2.
&gt; semiconductor LED displays are still pretty uncommon in consumer applications

3.
&gt; Dark mode is often harder on your battery unless you're using an LED-based display


1.
That is *exactly* what a TV marketed as an “LED TV” is.

2.
Consumer LED displays are not “uncommon.” Consumer LED displays don’t exist (yet).

3.
Naw, buddy. Dark mode is not easier if the electroluminescent element in your display is an LED. [Easy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) is the opposite of [hard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ). Unless is a conjunction, it means “except if” and is used to form a juxtaposition of two clauses.
Therefore what you wrote means “dark mode is harder, except if you are using a display based on LEDs, then the opposite is true: dark mode is easier when using a display based on LEDs”. You further specify what you mean by “opposite” thusly:

&gt;OLED and some other technologies are the exception

The exception to “dark mode is easier when using a display based on LEDs” is OLED? Dark mode is *[harder](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)* when using OLEDs? Not the case, my anvil-dwelling friend.

The only consumer displays containing LEDs are LCDs backlit by those LEDs. In other words, by definition only “LED-based displays” are backlit by said LEDs. See again your comment:

&gt; Dark mode is often harder on your battery unless you're using an LED-based display

When a display is *backlit* by LEDs—in other words, a display with driven LEDs as an electroluminescent layer behind a tinted liquid crystal layer—we call that an LCD. This type of display *uses* LEDs, to be sure and it uses them in combination with a second driven element: an LCD. A **l**iquid **c**rystal **d**isplay.

The electroluminescent layer (you might call this a “lightbulb”) is an LED. It creates light. Like a [lightbulb](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ).

That light shines through a tinted liquid crystal transistor layer which causes that light to appear as one of three (sometimes four) colors.

In this design, “black” takes more energy than “white” (which is not really white, but I’m not going in to the different ways to create the perception of “white”) because we need the liquid crystal layer to turn [on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) to [obscure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) or [block](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) the backlight completely. When the backlight is blocked, you perceive no color, therefore “black”. (Or close to it). When a device is [on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) it generally consumes more energy than when that device is [off](https://www.pornhub.com].

I’ll put that *another* way in case you need an ELI2 instead of an ELI5: when the liquid crystal layer creates an image through reflectivity or tint, white is the *easiest* color to make because the liquid crystal layer is “off” and you can see the light behind it. That light is white. Easy things take less energy to do. Therefore displaying the color white uses less energy than any color that requires obstruction of the backlight.

OLEDs need no backlight. Each pixel is itself an electroluminescent element. Therefore we can organize many OLEDs in such a way that they create a cohesive, driven, display. Each OLED becomes a pixel coordinate in that larger display.

In order to create the appearance of “black” in a display comprised of many electroluminescent pixels, we can simply turn the pixel at a specific coordinate off. That makes the “easiest” color for a display of this design to produce black; a “black” pixel is an “off.” Things that are “easier” take less energy than things that are not easy—or [hard](http://www.pornhub.com)—if you will. Therefore a display comprised of OLEDs will use significantly less energy when displaying black than when displaying any other color.

Note again that this is the opposite of the way an LED backlit display operates. Therefore your assertion that dark mode is harder when using an LED based display—and your rude comment that I should feel

Well, that's the definition of being rude.

You are doing something you know other people don't like because you find it normal or more important than their opinion or well-being.

Men are generally better at focused and tunnel vision activities. There's good science behind these statements and there are studies to back it up. Men, incidentally, are generally better at staving off hunger.

There are 78 specific genes differentiating men and women. To disregard them in terms of behaviour is foolish. I'm not saying they can't be overidden through social conditioning, or that they are absolute, they do lead to statistical behavioural differences though. It's hard to condition someone, a woman, to not feel the effects of having far more pain receptors than someone else, a man, though. I hate to have to point out these scientific facts to you but they're there. 

Now, I don't think any of this deserves consideration in order to prohibit anyone from doing or being anything they want. I'm merely pointing out that the differences exist and they have their effects on our societies and need to be considered. I am not a sexist!

This is all particularly pertinent in context. A group of women are better suited to supporting female victims of male violence. I'm not going to retract that. My resolve on it is only strengthened.

I live in a predominantly Asian neighborhood so naturally seeing a couple of those pictures were kinda cringe-inducing for me. Being Asian myself (born outside the country) I always set out to break apart from the normal dudes with snapbacks and skinny jeans or the foreign exchange students with their dyed hair and domo accessories.

Your hair is one of your biggest assets. It, along with your sense of style, is what most people will judge when they first look at you. Sad, but true. I understand these are just a couple of pictures you're taking of yourself at home and I myself rarely wear anything other than a wifebeater/t shirt + shorts at home.

So as for hair, you can go with the good ol' swept back that everyone is doing these days:

Being in highschool I know that this won't really be an option for you, because most 'big' changes in high school are met with teasing and such, but you could just do a military buzzcut. That way you can let your hair grow out to lengths that you've never really seen it, and test what looks good on you and on your facial/body structure. Like someone said earlier, work out. Don't go to the gym and just start pumping iron; but get fit. Athletic. Know your way around your own body so that you can begin exploring the outside world. Don't fall into a clique. Never let yourself feel comfortable by looking the same as the people around you. Be original. Do yo thang, brother.

 However, I completely agree that voidweavers age going to be a sleeper unit. I don't even use the voidweavers to guard a Death Jester after the nerf to Harvester of Torment as I went back to taking a single Jester, but they have the potential of guarding any of our characters, as they can even keep up with a blitzed Solitaire. What I've mainly been using them for is to sit on midfield objectives while the rest of my army positions for a counter attack and flanks along their sides. This forces them to choose between removing a relatively resilient vehicle off of an objective and destroying the things attacking them and causing havoc. If I absolutely HAVE to control an objective, rarely can my opponent remove a buffed up unit of skyweavers AND a voidweaver, even with focusing them down.

Also, between 10 jetbikes, 2 fusion boats, and 2 voidweavers, people see all those fast, scary bikes and vehicles and they tend to forget all about the little slender space elves running about until it's too late.

"A bonus per each child? Please tell me more. As I understand it, they give more money to households with more mouths to feed. This is not just targeted at women. A household with four members having the same income as someone with three will always get more money, even if the four consists of a married couple and two children. Also, single fathers get the same benefits as single mothers, if they make the same amount of money. Lumping all food stamp recipients into the category of women who pump out children with abandon is not only rude, but unfounded. Furthermore, being on food stamps is no walk in the park. It is riddled with complications, requirements, and visits to offices of underpaid staff members who are resentful of the process. 
I also do not understand your contempt for a government program that feeds the hungry. I am a single mother of two children. By single, I mean really single.

I am going to say this once, if it wasn't for food stamps, my children would not be able to EAT. (Of course, I would probably steal before letting them starve.) By no fault of their own, I chose a poor partner who after the divorce, was not supportive. By no fault of their own, I chose to wait tables instead of going to school.

I'm pre-HRT mtf living with my unsupportive elderly parents. I'm currently doing my PhD but due to COVID19 and health problems from anxiety I'm working from home.

A couple of years ago I had tried to transition and make them understand that I had to do it but they became so bad shit crazy screaming that they would die if I did it and ""nobody would support me"" yada yada... and I backed down (which caused my health to go rapidly downhill).

Few days ago I was stupid enough to tell my mother - after her asking me persistently - where I was going to go - to have laser (6th session now). Since then she has been very worried and angry regarding me going out saying that she's afraid I will contact COVID19 and infect them too. And that she doesn't want to die that way.

  
She has set an ultimatum that if I go and have laser again I shouldn't come back and go find a place to rent. Keep in mind we live in a big house and I have tried to convince my father to empty the basement from old apparatus and things he has (unfortunately he's a hoarder) so I could go there while he could go upstairs but he has blatantly refused.

Strictly speaking they can't make me leave and I can't leave in the condition I am (have difficulty walking - adrenal issues, plus being on the verge of crying all day).

Past few months - weeks I've kept my mother on an information diet. A couple of days ago I finally told both of them that we are not going to discuss anything regarding my transition and that it's a personal matter. She got angry saying that as long as we live together she has to know what I'm doing, where I'm going. She also stressed that me saying I have personal issues is rude and that I didn't used to be like that.

So, what do you think? Also, advice on changing my behavior? I don't want to appear rude but firm.

Thanks!

"I'll say this one last time. You said if AA is necessary, minorities are less qualified than whites. Think about that sentence for a bit.  AA was not implemented because minorities are less qualified.  And Just because AA is necessary does not mean minorities are less qualified. 

When I say employers are biased, I mean all employers. If all the employers are white, they will all be biased to hire white people.  There's studies shown that a white male with a criminal record has a better chance of being hired than a black male with no record, even if they have the same qualifications. Your proposed solution that somehow someone else will hire the minority does not actually play out in real life.  And having qualified employees does not mean that the business will prosper.  That's being idealistic.

Secondly, white are almost never under represented in one field.  If they were underrepresented yes, than AA would make people hire white people.  However reality isn't like that. And yes, AA is biased.  But it is implemented on the premise that society is biased.  And that there has been a biased against minorities for the past hundreds of centuries.

"I don't think they are, really! I live in Paris and, being from the French countryside, I grew up having quite a poor opinion of Parisians, but I really think it's just a misunderstanding. People seem to accept that New Yorkers, who live in one of the biggest and busiest cities on Earth, can sometimes be snappy and rude, but somehow Parisians aren't allowed to be, despite living in a big capital too? Many tourists tend to forget that just because it's quaint and pretty, Paris isn't a theme park (I'm sure you're not like that though).  

Contrary to what many people think, politeness is actually very important in France, and in Paris too. The problem is that most of the rules are unwritten. Many tourists, especially Americans, tend to expect cultural differences and odd social norms when going to exotic places likes Japan or China, but assume that everything in France works just like at home. It doesn't: some things that Americans think is polite, French people will think is rude. It's important to know what to expect and what to do, because while French people would usually give you a pass if you don't abide by every little unwritten rule, Parisians who have to deal with tourists all year long might not be as understanding. Here are a few things to keep in mind:  

* You shouldn't walk up to people in the street and start asking for directions right away. You have to say hello, apologize for disturbing, wait for them to say hello back, and then you can ask what you wanted to ask. It sounds complicated, but it's a second nature to most people here and forgetting it might result in people answering very snappily or even walking away. Seriously: I like to think I'm a relatively nice person and I love to help out tourists, but when they walk up to you in the street and just go ""hello I want to know how to go wherever"" without letting you say a word, it's extremely annoying and doesn't make me want to help them very much.  

* Little shops like bakeries and such aren't public spaces: you have to say hello when entering, even if the shopkeeper can't hear you, and idealy say goodbye when leaving. The divide between public and private spaces isn't the same in France than in America, at all, and those little shops are considered extensions of the owner's home (they often actually are), so you have to behave like you would in a home, and say hello. It's a little thing, but it'll be appreciated and the shopkeeper will be that much friendlier towards you! You don't have to do it in big supermarkets and the like, though. 

* Waiters. What to do, what to do. You've probably heard everything about Parisians waiters, and it's true that some of them are downright unpleasant. As a rule of thumb, avoid touristy spots when eating or drinking, they're too expensive anyway. A good example of something that Americans find polite that is considered rude in France is the check: French waiters won't bring you the check until you ask. An American might think it's rude and that they're being ignored, but it's actually bringing the check unsolicited that would be considered rude in France: it pretty much means the restaurant is asking you to get out.  

* Last thing: smiling. By American politeness conventions, it's pretty much a requirement. It simply isn't in France, so don't think people dislike you or anything if they don't smile when talking to you, we only smile when we mean it. You can take advantage of your vacation in France to relax you facial muscles!

&gt;&gt; Well I don't think it's trivial to refuse to use pretend pronouns
&gt;
&gt;If you can somehow make a [stink](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-37875695) out of having to call someone ""they"" in this day and age, then I'm sorry, but you are simply being obnoxious and unyielding.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; he said he won't use the pronouns of people who use made up ones like xir, which I think is not only reasonable but absolutely necessary
&gt;
&gt;No, the scumbag was just [lumping together ""they"" and ""xir""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equivocation) in order to force people to choose between ""he"" and ""she"". Do you think university administrators were (or should be) stupid enough to fall for his pathetic excuses?

&gt;Q. Will “gender identity” and “gender expression” be defined in the Bill?

&gt;A. In order to ensure that the law would be as inclusive as possible, the terms “gender identity” and “gender expression” are not defined in the Bill. With very few exceptions, grounds of discrimination are not defined in legislation but are left to courts, tribunals, and commissions to interpret and explain, based on their detailed experience with particular cases.

&gt;Definitions of the terms “gender identity” and “gender expression” have already been given by the Ontario Human Rights Commission, for example. The Commission has provided helpful discussion and examples that can offer good practical guidance. The Canadian Human Rights Commission will provide similar guidance on the meaning of these terms in the Canadian Human Rights Act.

The creators of the bill itself admit they will not clarify the issue and leave it up to be interpreted, however they do say that gender neutral pronouns must be used when requested. They do note clarify on what constitutes a gender neutral pronoun. 

Furthermore, we can look at the cited example of a body who gets to interprets the law, the OHRC:

http://www.ohrc.on.ca/en/gender-identity-and-gender-expression-brochure

&gt;Gender expression is how a person publicly presents their gender. This can include behaviour and outward appearance such as dress, hair, make-up, body language and voice. A person’s chosen name and **pronoun are also common ways of expressing gender.**

I find no further clarification. They do not list a set of valid or nonvalid gender pronouns anywhere I can find. They list ""they"" as a valid gender neutral pronoun because it is in the Oxford dictionary, that is the extent of the clarification. 

With that being said, it is hard for me to find an argument that pronouns like xir and other such nonsense aren't included under this law. Until such clarification is made than the argument stands. Also, even if there is a set list of gender neutral pronouns it doesn't mean this law is just. It still doesn't justify gender neutral pronouns but still compells speech. 


&gt;&gt; On him being angry and bitter I don't really see it.
&gt;
&gt;Because people well above your age tend to know how to hide that in order to avoid being perceived as emotionally vulnerable?
&gt;
&gt;The term ""passive-aggressive"" exists in social vernacular for a pretty good reason, you know.

This is both incredibly patronizing and borderline hypocritical, considering you're already flirting with being passive aggressive with me. However, I'd say your being plainly aggressive by the end, although only mildly aggressive. I am going to ask you to stop. 

Also, I don't see him as being passive aggressive to a significant extent. 

&gt;&gt; I've seen interviews where he gets very passionate but I've never seen him be outright mean or nasty to someone. 
&gt;
&gt;Maybe you should consider taking off your rose-coloured spectacles whenever Dr. Zoidberg starts blathering about abolishing gender studies or speaking bitterly of bogeymen on ""the left"" with [Stefan Molyneux](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOScYBwMyAA)?

I'm not watching a 45 minute video, but I see no connection between this and Jordan Peterson. I just see Molyneux stating some shit that is probably false or a misrepresentation and making a title with a blatantly false assertion that certainly goes against Peterson's beliefs, seeing as treating mental disease is his actual profession and he talks about it constantly. 

&gt;&gt; Lastly, the article you cited may be very well made and accurate but considering you've done nothing to tie it into anything Peterson has said I don't really feel any need to address it, it's completely off subject. 
&gt;
&gt;The guy was literally attempting to justify his argument on human behaviour with *lobster physiology*. Are you really this wilfully ignorant of just how big a delusional crank he is?

No, the argument is that hierarchies have existed throughout almost every species we have evolved from, and even existed as far back as lobsters. The argument he is making is that it is so ingrained into our biology that even ancestors who we broke off with hundreds of millions of years ago have it, and our closest cousins the chimpanzees have it, and we have it. Hierarchies are something that we evolved to create, and we can't just get rid of them any more than we can get rid of fear or sadness. That's why he argues in favor of structuring society in a way that our hierarchies are as fair as reasonably possible, because it is the best we can ever hope to do.

The assertion that he believes human psychology is the same as lobsters is incorrect and intellectual dishonest. All it is is pointing our that we evolved to be hierarchical and not much else.

"Your explanation of these beliefs is fascinating, so thank you.

However, I'd like to point out that your assumptions of atheists/agnostics are not very informed and I feel betray a certain amount of close-mindedness on your part. 

Let alone the assumption that atheism is a result of teenagers trying to rebel/establish their identities. Adolescents have always been around, growing up and rebelling as they like to do, but secularization is a very modern thing. 

Additionally, you've stated two things which don't seem to me to match up. Could you explain? 

&gt; So, as you can see, we've been in kali yuga a long time. (Since ~3000 BC!)

But: 

~The second begins to see some ""darkness"" enter into the world. People are no longer governed by God, but by kings and emperors. Our works and understanding of the world begin to become increasingly perverted.

I might be remembering my history wrong, but I thought that in 3000 BC, there were only a small scattering of civilizations complex enough to even have kings or emperors (if they could really be considered that)...I think the first monarchs were only in ~3100 BC or thereabouts.

So how did people start turning from ""God"" to kings and emperors, two ages before these were even starting to exist? Am I getting my history wrong, or does this belief system you've explained reject archaeological and historical records?

Nevermind that the year you mark as the beginning of a decline, not just in spiritual but in moral and social terms, was around the time civilizations began to rise and become stable.

"I didn't ""come out"" as an atheist to my family until very recently, because I saw no point in discussing it; I felt it would only place myself in an unnecessarily stressful situation. 

I laugh at the jokes on r/atheism and facepalm at the delusional facebook statuses, but in ""real life"" I try to be a kind, nonjudgmental person. What you do or don't believe in is your own business, and so long as you keep it that way, I have no problem with it. I try not to be resentful of or consider myself intellectually superior to the religious community -- as difficult as it can be -- because I don't want to be an asshole. Most of us have been there, anyway. From experience, arguing from any type of righteous, high-horse point of view (on any side of the fence) tends to make the opposition hold on even more desperately to their position. I'm not confrontational about my lack of beliefs unless it's absolutely imperative.

HOWEVER, my sister is a very loudmouthed, outspoken critic of religion. While I agree with her position on just about every issue, she comes off as rude and demeaning, and she can be a real jerk about it. 

I only came out because she made it easier on me. Even then, I probably wouldn't have come out because I don't feel a compulsive need to talk about it, but my family was complaining about her atheism and bemoaning about where they could have gone wrong to ""raise an atheist"", so I came out mostly as a way of defending her and pointing out that yes, she may be rude, but she's not the irrational one. I had to explain to them that like Christians or Muslims or any other group, there can be bad and good apples. 

After I came out, my parents said some pretty generic, hurtful things (mostly regurgitated fear-mongering). But eventually my Mom came around a little bit, and I think she's relieved to find that atheists can be normal, moral people. So I guess that's the reason to do it -- so less and less people will face discrimination.","while i agree with her position on just about every issue, she comes off as rude and demeaning, and she can be a real jerk about it.","rude and demeaning","rude","but",FALSE,"rude and demeaning","demeaning",NA,NA,1,"reddit",-0.58459,"thick_moral_concepts_NEG","negative",NA,NA,"thick_moral_concepts"

"A propensity is a tendency or an inclination. It's not absolute. There is some cross over but there are distinct male and female behavioral traits and skill-sets. Studies of humans and other animals have shown this, given certain tasks women perform better than men and vice versa. Women, generally outperform men in multitasking and reading social situations. Men are generally better at focused and tunnel vision activities. There's good science behind these statements and there are studies to back it up. Men, incidentally, are generally better at staving off hunger.

There are 78 specific genes differentiating men and women. To disregard them in terms of behaviour is foolish. I'm not saying they can't be overidden through social conditioning, or that they are absolute, they do lead to statistical behavioural differences though. It's hard to condition someone, a woman, to not feel the effects of having far more pain receptors than someone else, a man, though. I hate to have to point out these scientific facts to you but they're there. 

Now, I don't think any of this deserves consideration in order to prohibit anyone from doing or being anything they want. I'm merely pointing out that the differences exist and they have their effects on our societies and need to be considered. I am not a sexist!

"As an atheist I have a very simple test to determine if someone is Christian or not: I go by what they say.  Given my lack of involvement in that region (or any religion) I think it'd be not merely rude, but presumptuous and foolish for me to say that someone who professes to be a Christian isn't.

And, of course, as you say we get into No True Scotsman territory that way too.

Some Christian sects (Catholics especially) do provide explicit mechanisms for declaring that an individual is not considered, by the Church officials, to be a member of that sect.  But excommunication, and its various Protestant equivalents, is pretty rare, and that really describes more the attitude of the official church to its former members than the internal processes of the ex-member.

As for ""good morals and values"", that's always a somewhat slippery thing to define.  Most people don't think of themselves as evil, even when they do evil.  I'm sure that most of the people who supported Prop 8 in California were convinced that they were doing what was right.  It'd be nice to imagine them as cackling cartoon villains gleefully plotting to harm their fellow citizens, but I doubt that's true for more than a handful of them.  Mostly the people who do moral evil (such as supporting Prop 8) think of themselves as doing moral good.

Similarly, I'm certain that ""Bull"" Conner wasn't acting from what he considered to be evil motives when he so viciously attacked the civil rights protesters.  Rather, he most likely considered that he was acting from the ""good morals"" of protecting the social order, protecting society from the evils of integration, etc.  

Look at [this photo](http://contexts.org/socimages/2009/10/10/race-mixing-is-communism/), for example, of those who opposed integration.  Note especially the sign that is somewhat obscured by a person's head, it reads: ""STOP the race mixing march of the antichrist"".

The protesters in that picture weren't marching from what they thought of as bad morals, quite the opposite, they were convinced they were marching against immorality and for morality.

Like every other bit of genuine human knowledge, our understanding of morality improves over time.  People 500 years ago were less moral than people today, because they lacked our better understanding of morality.  Just as they were less healthy because they lacked our better understanding of disease.  People in the 1950's were less moral than people today for the same reason: they just didn't understand morality as well.

&gt;But in a relationship, to me, the key value is to fight for the relationship, for each other, and not being willing to give up.

Hmmm, there I think I may disagree completely.  A relationship shouldn't be a struggle, and if it is I think it's probably better to end it.  A certain degree of give and take, of working to make time to talk and whatnot, isn't a bad thing, but if maintaining a relationship becomes a genuine effort why continue it?  

Obviously there may be special circumstances, the relationship between people who need to cooperate because they're coworkers, for example, but even there I'd argue that when the effort of maintaining the relationship gets to a certain point it's better to find a different job and avoid possibly explosive relationship problems.

Even in the case of a couple with children, I don't think I can agree that it's best to maintain the relationship when it gets past a certain point.  Divorce is no good for kids, but it is likely better than parents who do nothing but scream at each other.

The truth is that I do largely agree that people with wildly different values aren't likely to form a good relationship, it isn't impossible I've seen it and likely so have you, but the likelihood isn't that great.

Where I disagree is with the idea that meddlesome people in positions of authority should make an effort to break up a relationship, especially armed with arguments from authority that one person in the relationship considers to be sinful to disagree with.  People make mistakes, that's how we learn.  If the OP and his girlfriend are incompatible, they'll find out soon enough and no harm done.

To me the situation, as described by the OP, looked like a clear and ugly case of atheist/agnostic/non-Christian bashing by youth minister.  ""You're better than those nasty **others**, dump your boyfriend or Jesus won't love you anymore.""  This seems not merely meddlesome, but like an abuse of authority, and for what seems to be genuinely petty reasons.","given my lack of involvement in that region (or any religion) i think it'd be not merely rude, but presumptuous and foolish for me to say that someone who professes to be a christian isn't.","rude, but presumptuous","rude","but",TRUE,"merely rude , but presumptuous","presumptuous","merely",NA,1,"reddit",-0.22793,"thick_moral_concepts_NEG","negative",NA,NA,"thick_moral_concepts"

He’s still learning to read so I help with the text, but otherwise he’s gotten the hang of it and can do everything himself. Lifelong gamers may complain about how “back in their day” games were hard as shit and they coped, but it’s great to have a game he can definitely work out and play himself. 

He really loves his partner (“Nev”) and is very proud of catching and evolving his team. He found and caught a Bulbasaur, his fave, in Viridian Forest, and had a look of pure joy that melted my heart a little. 

I also started my own save and caught a shiny Bellsprout an hour in with only a moderate combo bonus - the second shiny I’ve ever caught outside of Go.

"Yea, I've done some of these things in the past and it's definitely not something I did to intentionally be an asshole, but it's also not just a simple introvert thing. (I'm not trying to excuse this behaviour for the record, because I get how inconvenient and annoying it can be, just explain it.) During some of my worst depression/anxiety episodes, I would sometimes just cancel my plans with an hours notice because I couldn't stop shaking at the thought of leaving the house or I was too physically exhausted to make it to the shower to clean myself. And that's not really the type of thing you can explain to some people, especially teenagers who don't understand mental illness and see depression and anxiety as just being a pessimistic coward. Now that I'm an adult, I have to take responsibility for myself so I take medication for my mental illnesses and have learned coping techniques to allow me to push through and fulfill my obligations (and on the occasions that I absolutely can't, I just tell people the truth and apologize profusely or get help from my partner.) 

I also have a hard time believing that people who never ask about your day are getting offended if you don't ask about theirs. I have trouble picking up on social norms and have to either have things explicitly explained to me or actively observe people's social interactions over and over before I figure out how I'm supposed to communicate with people. (My mom and doctor suspect autism, but it's a whole annoying process getting diagnosed as an adult and my doctor and I agree that I have more pressing issues that need to be addressed first.) I didn't realize that when someone asks you how you are or how your day was, you're supposed to reciprocate until I was 22.

One tip I will give you: If you come, you MUST be prepared to be patient, mum and dad have american friends come through all the time on holidays and they get infuriated with people from stores etc just because there is no urgency compared to their home country which makes everybody angry.

"I don't believe that  [u](https://www.reddit.com/user/axolotl_peyotl/)/axolotl\_peyotl genuinely cares about r/UFOs.

He has long since stopped performing even the most perfunctory mod duties here.

His sole activity in this series of events was to foment a torches and pitchforks kind of furore on other subs.

He does not know what reasoning ASK47 had for removing the Rio posts. He did not contact the mods here at  all in mod chat or anywhere else, he unilaterally opened up the automod script here, he took the list of mod actions done and published them on another sub. How is that in any way a professional or ethical thing to do? He communicated his actions more to randos than to the mods here.

The only times I've seen axolotl\_peyotl on the mod mail comms is to talk shit about r/UFOs months ago. It may have been longer.

It seems to me that he is misrepresenting the facts. I challenged him on this in the other thread. I suggested he was being unethical, that he was using his position in a hypocritical way. He didn't answer that challenge, he instead came and made this thread after an hour or two. There's a word for that behaviour, but apparently people get unreasonably upset if I speak too plainly.

He presents himself here as taking the moral high ground, but what he's really done is hold on to a mod status that he doesn't use - he does not moderate this sub, timmy and ASK do nearly all of the work - and use it to his advantage in manipulating the people who listen to him in his other sub for opaque reasons. No, I don't accept his justifications on their face, because he has not been open with his concerns privately with the mods here.

He's undermining any principles he claims to have in doing so. He came into the sub which he doesn't even post in let alone moderate and altered the automod script. I don't see that as an ethical or principled thing to do. He published the data of the internal mod actions on another sub.

Yeah, I handled the thread yesterday poorly, to say the least, and I shot my mouth off when I didn't have the full info. I thought accusations of removal of threads were false, and said so, because I didn't see them in the log. I was wrong. Boy did you let me know it.

Yes, I was rude, because of what I saw as abusive messages in the post, and that was out of order. I didn't see the origins or reasons for people being upset, because I hadn't seen the series of events that had transpired. I saw what I thought was a concerted attempt at trolling and flipped out. I absolutely do feel shit for doing that, right in the guts, I know I fucked up.

I said r/conspiracy is a cesspool. Frankly that is my honest personal opinion. I don't see that my moderation position requires me to withhold my personal opinions of this nature, and obviously axolotl\_peyotl agrees, because he's says what he thinks about r/UFOS, right?

axolotl\_peyotl also told you that the keywords in the automod script were permanent, but how does he know this? How does he know that they aren't going to be removed after the flood of new posts has been dealt with? In this sub, when a news story comes out, we get multiple reposts of the same story in a short period of time, which is one of the things we were asked to deal with. I pointed this out to him and he said nothing.

Once again, axolotl\_peyotl doesn't have the full picture, and barged into the sub's moderation code and altered it without talking to ASK47 or timmy242, and *he told you something that he couldn't know was true*.

He does not have clean hands in this. What are his true motivations? I haven't the faintest idea. But if I had no particular opinion of his character before, I certainly do now.

I called the actions of some people stupid. That was rude of me, but the statement was accurate.

The way some people here have conducted themselves over this Rio hoax - and it is a hoax - is downright childish. Like screaming bloody idiots. The abusive reactions were absolutely pathetic, and it is to my shame that I reacted emotionally in response. But I stand by saying that these people should have acted like adults and not hysterics imagining some grand conspiracy. There isn't any. I see that axolotl\_peyotl's posts on r/conspiracy went some way to stirring up that hysteria. You should all be ashamed of yourselves.

Should the thread about the Rio Event have staid up? IMHO yes. I don't think there's anything to the story and the videos are garbage. The main promoters of the story appear to be promoting a hoax, maybe knowingly. Does that mean it should have been culled? In my opinion no, but I didn't make the call and I will not change the actions of another mod, because that is not ethical. I'm not going to undermine someone else's decision in that way, it is not my place.

This upset could have been dealt with better, and I am mostly to blame for being particularly dense and typically rude, but axolotl\_peyotl has created much more drama by trying to foment this unpleasantness by presenting the information he obtained through the retaining of his mod permissions in an unethical way. I'll go even further: the word for it is corrupt.

I am a lot of things. I'm an asshole. I'm cynical and misanthropic. I'm arrogant and difficult to like. But I'm not bloody corrupt and I've never censored anything in my life.

I am absolutely OK with being unmodded from the sub. I throw myself upon the mercy of the court.

But axolotl\_peyotl  should unmod himself from the sub that he has clearly shown he viscerally despises and remove all moderation permissions he has here.

What I've seen shows me a mean and vindictive man who will abuse the rights he holds for personal reasons. If he really has principles, he will do this. I predict he will not.

Why bother accepting a job that doesn't pay enough just to avoid the stigma of being unemployed? It inconveniences the employer who will then have to renew his search, and on paper, it makes the person look disloyal to potential employees.

"I don't think they are, really! I live in Paris and, being from the French countryside, I grew up having quite a poor opinion of Parisians, but I really think it's just a misunderstanding. People seem to accept that New Yorkers, who live in one of the biggest and busiest cities on Earth, can sometimes be snappy and rude, but somehow Parisians aren't allowed to be, despite living in a big capital too? Many tourists tend to forget that just because it's quaint and pretty, Paris isn't a theme park (I'm sure you're not like that though).  

Contrary to what many people think, politeness is actually very important in France, and in Paris too. The problem is that most of the rules are unwritten. Many tourists, especially Americans, tend to expect cultural differences and odd social norms when going to exotic places likes Japan or China, but assume that everything in France works just like at home. It doesn't: some things that Americans think is polite, French people will think is rude. It's important to know what to expect and what to do, because while French people would usually give you a pass if you don't abide by every little unwritten rule, Parisians who have to deal with tourists all year long might not be as understanding. Here are a few things to keep in mind:  

* You shouldn't walk up to people in the street and start asking for directions right away. You have to say hello, apologize for disturbing, wait for them to say hello back, and then you can ask what you wanted to ask. It sounds complicated, but it's a second nature to most people here and forgetting it might result in people answering very snappily or even walking away. Seriously: I like to think I'm a relatively nice person and I love to help out tourists, but when they walk up to you in the street and just go ""hello I want to know how to go wherever"" without letting you say a word, it's extremely annoying and doesn't make me want to help them very much.  

* Little shops like bakeries and such aren't public spaces: you have to say hello when entering, even if the shopkeeper can't hear you, and idealy say goodbye when leaving. The divide between public and private spaces isn't the same in France than in America, at all, and those little shops are considered extensions of the owner's home (they often actually are), so you have to behave like you would in a home, and say hello. It's a little thing, but it'll be appreciated and the shopkeeper will be that much friendlier towards you! You don't have to do it in big supermarkets and the like, though. 

* Waiters. What to do, what to do. You've probably heard everything about Parisians waiters, and it's true that some of them are downright unpleasant. As a rule of thumb, avoid touristy spots when eating or drinking, they're too expensive anyway. A good example of something that Americans find polite that is considered rude in France is the check: French waiters won't bring you the check until you ask. An American might think it's rude and that they're being ignored, but it's actually bringing the check unsolicited that would be considered rude in France: it pretty much means the restaurant is asking you to get out.  

* Last thing: smiling. By American politeness conventions, it's pretty much a requirement. It simply isn't in France, so don't think people dislike you or anything if they don't smile when talking to you, we only smile when we mean it. You can take advantage of your vacation in France to relax you facial muscles!

There's the issue. Not to be rude, but public education has drastically changed to the point kids truly don't get ""change"" as I'm sure she's not the only one who would be ""flubbed"" by this.

"My personal favorite is the 6th Doctor, Colin Baker, but I am in the EXTREME minority on this one. 6 is generally disliked even by longtime Whovians like myself, but I love him as an actor and think he did great considering his time and circumstances: The head of the BBC was actively trying to kill the series, and it was the first attempt to make a ""darker"" Doctor (well 4 had his dark side but very understated.), and a lot of people didn't get it after 3 years of the boyish charm and straightlaced heroics of 5. I like him because he brought back the ""alienness""  and mystery that I felt had been missing from Davison's era (Doctor #5) and I liked that he was unstable and rude but that's me. Most people seem to prefer more of a straight heroic instead of an anti-hero type Doctor (like 6 or 9 or even 7 come to think of it, but by his time the production values and writing were so abysmal that it's hard to tell sometimes what they were going for with him). Most longtime fans prefer the 4th (the one with the scarf, longest running, considered the ""golden gothic"" era of Who), 3rd or 5th Doctors from the classic series pretty much in that order, but it seems since New Who that everyone loves Tennant most, and I won't say he doesn't deserve it because I liked him a lot, but I liked Eccleston better (I know I'm weird).

"So lying is ilegal? Then all politicians should be put into prison (not a bad idea really). As I said to someone else in this thread:

The necessary limitations on free speech occur when there is quantifiable damage, like in a defamation lawsuit where you can show the action harming your ability to earn a living, or with freedom of expression the line gets drawn at snuff films and child pornography because crimes must be committed in order to create the content, that is, real people being hurt.

When we talk about hate speech we are talking about opinions. The opinions may be horrible, ignorant, and incredibly rude, but telling people they cannot voice said opinion is akin to telling them they are not allowed to have that opinion, which is getting into the territory of telling people what they are allowed to think.

A simple look at history shows why it is important to protect everyone's right to freedom of speech. In the dark ages you had scholars imprisoned for suggesting the earth is round, the equivalent of a flat earther in our time, an idea that contradicted basic scientific knowledge of that era. Then there was the inquisition and the protestant reformation where people were executed publicly and brutally over religion, ideas based on belief that can be neither proven nor disproven, it was the reason the americas founders wanted a separation of church and state. And history is littered with the corpses of people murdered by tyrants for speaking out against them.

1.
&gt;Yes, annoying marketing people in some parts of the world would like you to think that ""LED TV"" means LED-backlit LCD.

2.
&gt; semiconductor LED displays are still pretty uncommon in consumer applications

3.
&gt; Dark mode is often harder on your battery unless you're using an LED-based display


1. That is *exactly* what a TV marketed as an “LED TV” is.

2. Consumer LED displays are not “uncommon.” Consumer LED displays don’t exist (yet).

3. Naw, buddy. Dark mode is easier if the electroluminescent element in your display is an LED. The only consumer displays containing LEDs are LCDs backlit by those LEDs. In other words, by definition only “LED-based displays” are backlit by said LEDs. See again your comment:

&gt; Dark mode is often harder on your battery unless you're using an LED-based display

When a display is *backlit* by LEDs—in other words, a display with driven LEDs as an electroluminescent layer behind a tinted liquid crystal layer—we call that an LCD. This type of display *uses* LEDs, to be sure and it uses them in combination with a second driven element: an LCD. A **l**iquid **c**rystal **d**isplay.

The electroluminescent layer (you might call this a “lightbulb”) is an LED. It creates light. Like a [lightbulb](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ).

That light shines through a tinted liquid crystal transistor layer which causes that light to appear as one of three (sometimes four) colors.

In this design, “black” takes more energy than “white” (which is not really white, but I’m not going in to the different ways to create the perception of “white”) because we need the liquid crystal layer to turn [on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) to [obscure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) or [block](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) the backlight completely. When the backlight is blocked, you perceive no color, therefore “black”. (Or close to it). When a device is [on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) it generally consumes more energy than when that device is [off](https://www.pornhub.com].

I’ll put that *another* way in case you need an ELI2 instead of an ELI5: when the liquid crystal layer creates an image through reflectivity or tint, white is the *easiest* color to make because the liquid crystal layer is “off” and you can see the light behind it. That light is white. Easy things take less energy to do. Therefore displaying the color white uses less energy than any color that requires obstruction of the backlight.

OLEDs need no backlight. Each pixel is itself an electroluminescent element. Therefore we can organize many OLEDs in such a way that they create a cohesive, driven, display. Each OLED becomes a pixel coordinate in that larger display.

In order to create the appearance of “black” in a display comprised of many electroluminescent pixels, we can simply turn the pixel at a specific coordinate off. That makes the “easiest” color for a display of this design to produce black; a “black” pixel is an “off.” Things that are “easier” take less energy than things that are not easy (or [“hard”](http://www.pornhub.com) if you will). Therefore a display comprised of OLEDs will use significantly less energy when displaying black than when displaying any other color.

Note again that this is the opposite of the way an LED backlit display operates. Therefore your assertion that dark mode is harder when using an LED based display—and your rude comment that I should feel

"Hey Gutsy. :(

I'm sorry to hear that she tried to hurt you. Just keep in mind that she actively tried to rub it in that she was with a new boyfriend. You don't need that sort of person in your life. Like you said - she's crumbling and becoming a terrible person. Immature and ugly and rude, but you are becoming better! You're in a lot of emotional turmoil, yeah, because you don't just stop caring for someone overnight. At least, most people don't. I still care deeply for my ex, and I want her to be happy, but more and more I am coming to terms with the fact that I should just stop thinking of her, because what she does isn't something that I can 'control' anymore.

Clearly you had some positive influence on her life, and now that you're out of it, either she's reverting or showing her true colors or just hitting rock bottom. You are taking this time to heal and better yourself - don't let yourself falter! Just keep repeating to yourself how much she hurt you and how much you deserve to be happy. It's a mantra that I focus on whenever I feel sorry for myself or think about breaking NC.

"If I implied you were stupid for possibly not knowing the difference between a therapy animal and a service dog, I sincerely apologize. Having a service dog I run into people all of the time who are genuinely confused not because they are stupid but because they are not well informed.

And as far as telling you not to eat the dogs food - that was flippant and rude. But, again with a service dog you cannot expect them to do anything that a reasonable person wouldn't do. Your roommate relaxes in your room presumably without sleeping on your bed, licking your things or contaminating your stuff. A service dog would be no different. Even while relaxing you could expect it to stay on her side of the room. And your roommate somehow manages to feed herself without contaminating the room, I don't see how a service dog would be an issue. 

As to why I'm being an arse, do you seriously not see how coming to a forum of disabled people with service dogs who potentially face discrimination for their disability on a daily basis and asking about kicking your roommate out of her room might strike a nerve? Do you not see how rude and self centered that is?? If you want to be prepared for her arguments in this situation, you should expect demanding her to move to probably strike a nerve with her as well.

And no I will not relent on the it could be worse point. I get it your young, you love your dorm community, it's a big part of your identity and you do have a medical condition that limits part of your social interaction by not being able to eat out freely with people. But here's the thing legally none of that matters, at all. And I'm sure when you're older you'll look back and realize how much that pales in comparison to being disabled. 

Let's say you need to go to the bank, what do you do to prepare? What about the library? Or the post office? Or the movies? Can you just go and do those things? 

As someone who spent two months of the past year in the hospital, who sees a doctor an average of 2.5 times per week, who lives in constant fear of rudeness and (illegal) refusal of service based on my disability, it's extremely hard to not be rude to someone who is asking how to best discriminate against someones disability. 

As much as I love my SD and would not be able to function without him (it's humiliating to be in your mid-20s and NEED your parents to go to the grocery store with you), I would give anything to not be disabled. I would give anything to be able to just go to the bank on my own with no preparations or concerns.

So seriously, just take a breath and a step back and realize that the likelihood of your roommate getting a service dog before the year is out is low. And even if it happens, the chances that it would affect you at all is basically nothing - whatever your roommate does to feed herself without bothering you should work for the dog to. And even if somehow your allergies are bothered by the dog, you have no idea someone might love dogs and be dying to switch with you so you can stay in your community. And absolute worst case scenario, you have to live in a different dorm which makes seeing your friends in your current dorm slightly more of a hassle. **It definitely could be worse.**

PS Seriously you would expect your roommate to feed the dog raw food? Like dog sashimi 24/7? And the biggest issue you see with this is the fridge size??

For some perspective... in one of your comments you said you've only been coding for a year. Let's assume you somehow started (successfully) job hunting the day you started coding (which is also a bullshit assumption). That gives us roughly 365 days. If this has happened to you over 70 times, that means you've literally been hired and then fired once a week every week. Sometimes twice a week. I seriously doubt that's even a little bit plausible.

But let's assume you aren't lying. Then I can only guess that you're misunderstanding the process. There are often multiple rounds of interviews before you receive a job offer. Perhaps you're making it through the first round(s), filling out some more serious paperwork, and then not cutting it in the later stages.

"&gt; Strangers are just adults, statistically the chances of a ""stranger"" that you randomly pick at any given moment being an evil monster who will abduct you, as opposed to a human that will help you, are thankfully pretty godamn slim.

Yes, but chances that a stranger that randomly offers you a ride is attempting to abduct you is pretty fucking high.  Aside from the fact that most people don't offer rides for that very reason.  My own personal anecdote is that the one time I was ever offered a ride from a stranger while I was a child was someone asking me how to get to the hospital.  The hospital was literally a block away and visible through a few trees.  I pointed to the hospital, and then the guys says ""Why don't you hop in and show me.""  I froze for a minute, afraid of being rude but also mindful of all the ""after school special"" alarm bells going off in the my head and politely declined.

"There’s nobody in the back. It’s just you and me at this point. I promise nobody else cares about your little meltdown; just me because you were rude. Not only rude, but wrong, and then you doubled down.

So: I want to know why, other than pure narcissism, you are avoiding these comments (I will also explain your mistakes to you once again, just for the sake of clarity):

1.
&gt;Yes, annoying marketing people in some parts of the world would like you to think that ""LED TV"" means LED-backlit LCD.

2.
&gt; semiconductor LED displays are still pretty uncommon in consumer applications

3.
&gt; Dark mode is often harder on your battery unless you're using an LED-based display


1. That is *exactly* what a TV marketed as an “LED TV” is.

2. Consumer LED displays are not “uncommon.” Consumer LED displays don’t exist (yet).

3. Naw, buddy. Dark mode is easier if the electroluminescent element in your display is an LED. The only consumer displays containing LEDs are LCDs backlit by those LEDs. In other words, by definition only “LED-based displays” are backlit by said LEDs. See again your comment:

&gt; Dark mode is often harder on your battery unless you're using an LED-based display

When a display is *backlit* by LEDs—in other words, a display with driven LEDs as an electroluminescent layer behind a tinted liquid crystal layer—we call that an LCD. This type of display *uses* LEDs, to be sure and it uses them in combination with a second driven element: an LCD. A **l**iquid **c**rystal **d**isplay.

The electroluminescent layer (you might call this a “lightbulb”) is an LED. It creates light. Like a [lightbulb](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ).

That light shines through a tinted liquid crystal transistor layer which causes that light to appear as one of three (sometimes four) colors.

In this design, “black” takes more energy than “white” (which is not really white, but I’m not going in to the different ways to create the perception of “white”) because we need the liquid crystal layer to turn [on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) to [obscure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) or [block](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) the backlight completely. When the backlight is blocked, you perceive no color, therefore “black”. (Or close to it). When a device is [on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) it generally consumes more energy than when that device is [off](https://www.pornhub.com].

I’ll put that *another* way in case you need an ELI2 instead of an ELI5: when the liquid crystal layer creates an image through reflectivity or tint, white is the *easiest* color to make because the liquid crystal layer is “off” and you can see the light behind it. That light is white. Easy things take less energy to do. Therefore displaying the color white uses less energy than any color that requires obstruction of the backlight.

OLEDs need no backlight. Each pixel is itself an electroluminescent element. Therefore we can organize many OLEDs in such a way that they create a cohesive, driven, display. Each OLED becomes a pixel coordinate in that larger display.

In order to create the appearance of “black” in a display comprised of many electroluminescent pixels, we can simply turn the pixel at a specific coordinate off. That makes the “easiest” color for a display of this design to produce black; a “black” pixel is an “off.” Things that are “easier” take less energy than things that are not easy (or [“hard”](http://www.pornhub.com) if you will). Therefore a display comprised of OLEDs will use significantly less energy when displaying black than when displaying any other color.

Note again that this is the opposite of the way an LED backlit display operates. Therefore your assertion that dark mode is harder when using an LED based display—and your rude comment that I should feel
&gt;sad about correcting someone that's already correct

is not only rude, but laughable, as you were quite incorrect. Indeed your explanation conflated LED, LCD, and even OLED many times over.","therefore your assertion that dark mode is harder when using an led based display—and your rude comment that i should feel &gt;sad about correcting someone that's already correct  is not only rude, but laughable, as you were quite incorrect.","rude, but laughable","rude","but",TRUE,"only rude , but laughable","laughable","only",NA,1,"reddit",0.28011,"thick_moral_concepts_NEG","negative",NA,0,"thick_moral_concepts"

"Teaching is a tough job if you do it properly, but sadly many professors are not really qualified for it.

"NTA. First comment, I was let know would be removed, so I deleted it, because in fairness, I really wasn't following the rules (specifically Be Civil). 

But, in an attempt to be civil: 

You shouldn't be made to feel bad about a personal life choice (be it one you made for work) and it is rather undecorous of the aunt to mention the body hair/choice/real woman thing in the first place, especially on what is essentially a public forum.

I've seen some comments calling to play OPs career and futuee and I'm surprised that those are seen as civil or in fact, relevant. OP's career is not the key point here, and honestly how this seems to be a sticking point is quite... incredible for the 21st century. 

I don't care how people get their money, so long as people aren't getting hurt. If OP is happy and safe at work, then jolly good. 

P.S. I CACKLED. I wish I could have seen the reactions. I know people say what OP did was unrealistic, but these things have a way of coming out and often in ways we don't like. So at least this was OP being honest and taking a stand for her views.

"For The Little Mermaid, it depends what one's definition of feminism is. The first Part of That World song essentially describes Ariel as having body disphoria. It's easy to apply that song to the transgender movement.

Forgive me. Some people think transgenderism should be part of the feminist cause, and others do not. Without transgenderism, there's not much feminism of note in The Little Mermaid. I'll say that the woman and hero are both women, and Ariel being an interesting female character almost makes it a feminist movie by default because of how hard it is to find those in film. (It's been a year since I've seen Frozen or The Little Mermaid, so it's tough to put up a great defense for them.)

---

Basically the lesson is that I haven't seen very many feminist movies.

I've written a response to that *Frozen* article already, luckily for me. The response is mostly me tearing apart the article without offering my own case for why Frozen *is* feminist, so here it is:

Elsa chooses her own identity. Compare this to something like Disney's *Mulan*, in which Mulan is forced to act like a man.

---

Once again Let it Go is called [award]-bait. Apparently feminists are allowed to take power away from people who they don't think deserve it. And the idea that a character isn't good because they have personality flaws (which actually exist in the real world) is discriminatory to the point of disgust.

The practices described in Let It Go are not healthy but they are logical short-term decisions based on what Elsa has put up with. Eventually she would come around, or could be persuaded to return. Anna came up within the next day. If she waited a week, a month, a year, she'd be more open to discussion. Again, Elsa had just lived her life in a cage, and she can't even go a day without having to be put back in a cage. Of course she'd find that frightening.

&gt;Faced with her misdeeds, Elsa sets a golem on her sister and has to be dragged back to Arendelle in chains when she’s knocked unconscious by her own chandelier. This is not a strong woman. This is a frightened, repressed, vulnerable woman who starts running at the beginning of the movie and doesn’t stop until her sister literally turns to ice in front of her.

Women can't be strong unless they're physically strong? And if you're strong, you're not allowed to be bested ever? If the (male) Avengers are so strong, how come they occasionally face setbacks? Why isn't the movie just the unstoppable Avengers, going bowling and eating pizza, free from any threat?

Strong character to me means well-developed and/or realistic character. It has nothing to do with physical strength or even emotional strength. Don't believe me? A weak character isn't one who can't bench-press 50 pounds - a weak character is one dreamed up in 5 minutes by a toy department.

&gt;Elsa is a relatable antagonist who claims her identity and tells us it’s okay to be an individual.

No. Elsa is a relatable antagonist who claims her identity and tells us it’s okay to be an individual. She also shows us how hurtful individualism and selfishness can be.

The movie doesn't end with Anna's heart getting Frozen, does it? Character development can happen during the whole thing, right?

&gt;Quick trivia question: in how many Disney princess movies is the day saved by True Love’s Kiss™?

Who said that was the question? ""True love"" is pervasive in Disney, in fairy tales, and in culture as a whole. It's a really important concept to address, kiss or no.

The ""It gets worse."" sub-section is probably the worst of this whole article. The well-meaning trolls are comedic interpretations of the well-meaning parents and relatives who hope that anyone brought home or mentioned might finally be what gets them some grandkids.

The trolls are naive. It's a joke. They are rude and they don't know any better. They're desperate for their adopted son to finally have a girlfriend / wife. And do you [the author of the article, that is, not you the reader] really think Kristoff would have nonconsensual sex with Anna? Or that the trolls endorse that? At worst, the trolls say ""get married first and you'll fall for each other later. Just give it a shot!"". So imagine traditional courtship but with an arranged marriage at the beginning. Nobody's getting raped, a troll marriage isn't legally binding (and might be more casual in troll culture than human culture), and neither the trolls nor Kristoff are going to keep her there against her will.

""Her quote engagement is a flex arrangement"" -  this woman is the only chance the trolls have for their son, so they ignore and twist the truth to suit them. Naive and rude, not rape-endorsing.

&gt;And what’s worse is that we agree with the trolls. That moment reads as comedic because the audience isn’t expected to respect Anna’s agency either. We’ve already assumed she’ll end up with Kristoff. We’ve made the choice for her too.

Uh, thanks? I expected that because Kristoff is one of two relevant male characters in the movie, and the movie was so obviously setting up some issue with Hans that he's the only remaining choice (if you assume she marries one). A million other Disney movies are predictable as well.

&gt;And, just like Hans, the trolls don’t suggest the match with Kristoff for Anna’s benefit. The song is about how she can fix him.

""We're only saying that love's a force that's powerful and strange. ... Throw a little love their way and you'll bring out their best.""

Basically, you might grow to like him. Not the best message in the world (again, rude), but if you take the trolls at their word, Anna's getting something out of this.

The writer has the luxury of taking the best elements of past movies and making one super, perfect movie. Frozen doesn't do some things as well as other movies, but the other movies you're comparing it to also aren't as good as Frozen in some other ways. Frozen is all-around good, which is less than you can say for some of the Disney movies that are 90% crap except for the one thing this writer brought up.

**Stick with these sections if you want just the more reasonable arguments:**

* Elsa claims her sexuality as well as her individuality! She’s a modern woman!
* But Elsa doesn’t end up with a guy — and she’s just as important as Anna! (1/2 credit for bringing up some smart points and some idiotic ones)

I don't come to reddit for maturity and intellectual discussion, although that can be an added benefit, I actually come for the jokes, the comments (intelligent or otherwise), and the interesting content.

"Your response to that quote of Dr Howell's is fallacious, an *argumentum ad hominem*. Is what that paragraph says wrong? You're side-stepping it completely and simply attacking the man.

With regard to ""antipodal"" evidence, you have used the correct term if you are from the northern hemisphere. My friend is not ""lactase"" intolerant; rather it is because he cannot produce his own lactase that he is *lactose* intolerant. The FDA's ""information point #8"" is disingenuous: while pasteurised milk certainly doesn't *cause* lactose intolerance, it can most certainly make life temporarily miserable for those without the genetic ability to manufacture lactase. The FDA is diverting attention from the question that should have been posed: ""Can drinking pasteurized milk cause issues for people with lactose intolerance?"" The answer to that question is, of course, a resounding *yes*.

If you were confused and wished to speak of anecdotal evidence, I would comment that while anecdotal evidence does not make something true, it also does not make something false either. Anecdotal evidence can be rated as to its reliability by: 1)  the number of eyewitnesses, testimonials and claims; 2)  the consistency of the observations and claims; 3)  the credibility of the witnesses; 4)  the clarity of and proximity of the observation; and 5)  The state of mind of the witnesses. Bearing these in mind, I have confidence in the anecdotal evidence of my friend and his family about pasteurised milk causing him discomfort. The FDA's ""information point #8"", that pasteurised milk doesn't cause lactose intolerance I would also be pretty confident in, since I'm of the understanding that the inability of someone to produce their own lactase is genetic, and not caused by the milk. But the FDA's point addresses a different issue, so your use of it to attempt to imply my friend is a liar is not only rude, but erroneous as well.

Re your remark on shelf life, I was not comparing shelf life at all. If that subject interests you, then feel free to look into it. If keeping milk around for long periods is more important to you than freshness, there's always the unrefrigerated dead ultra-pasteurised milk that stores well in its box for six months or more. 

&gt;*I guess I can see how you would feel that it should be your right*

If not an individual's right to choose what he eats, are you saying then with the ""FDA taking steps"" that a US Federal government organisation instead has the right to decide what food citizens put in their mouths? Please, can you point me to the paragraph in the US Constitution where this right over food choice is granted to the government? Not being from the USA, this authoritarian concept I find surprising and shocking.

If you feel happy trusting the Federal Disinformation Agency, I wish you the very [best of luck](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB120225742208745785.html), as their food monitoring is reportedly [sketchy](http://www.cspinet.org/new/200707171.html) and their drug advice tends to kill and harm a lot of people. Ask the estimated [60,000](http://www.drugresearcher.com/Research-management/Whistleblowers-reveal-FDA-exacerbated-Vioxx-scandal) [Vioxx](http://www.naturalnews.com/011401_Dr_David_Graham_the_FDA.html) victims.. oh, sorry, you can't (but there are apparently some [9,200 lawsuits you can look for](http://www.lawyersandsettlements.com/articles/00118/fda.html)). [Rezulin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rezulin), [Ketek](http://www.lawyersandsettlements.com/articles/00680/ketek-scandal.html), [cancer drugs](http://www.lawyersandsettlements.com/articles/01635/provenge.html), are just some interesting reads. Some others include a 2009 report of some FDA scientists [who stated](http://www.healthcarepackaging.com/archives/2009/01/fda_scandal_bursts_but_quietly.php) the FDA is ""fundamentally broken,"" and ""corrupted and distorted by current FDA managers, thereby placing the American people at risk."" As recently as July 2010 the FDA is hard at work protecting industry, making sure that the drug [Avandia](http://www.foodconsumer.org/newsite/Non-food/Drug/diabetes_drug_avandia_should_stay_on_the_market_1607100206.html), which may raise heart attack probability by 43%, stays on the market.

You yourself resort to anecdotal evidence in quoting four news articles (two of which are about the same story). If you've ever known the truth of an incident and then seen it presented in the media, you would know that it's possible for stories to have an ""angle"" which can portray events in a particular light. But let's look at these ""resent"" (sent again?) articles more closely.. 

* ""Illness halts"" &amp; ""15 Fall Ill"" - the latter article on Alexandre Family EcoDairy Farms is brief and slanted, but the former is longer and includes illuminating details. The health department officer stated the food poisoning ""*appeared* to come from the same source"".. but this does not sound conclusive. [It's reported](http://www.triplicate.com/2008081696352/News/Local-News/Illness-halts-raw-milk-progra) that the farm owner, 

&gt;""Alexandre also questions whether the Campylobacter came from his farm. *He said he spoke to a person who is listed by the county health department as contracting the infection who said he didn't even drink raw milk during the time of the outbreak.*"". ""Campylobacter can be contracted through eating undercooked meats or by drinking water that has been contaminated by Campylobacter, such as if animal faeces with the bacteria in it was in contact with the water. ""

In other words, as soon as raw milk was found to be in a victim's diet, the search for a culprit unscientifically stopped, and guilt was established by assumption. If you take a look at [this old CDC chart](http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00044241.htm#00002040.htm) I was able to find, in 1989 you were more likely to contract food poisoning from fruit &amp; vegetables, ham, salad and beef than from milk. Of the 48 cases listed for milk, it's not broken down into pasteurised and non-pasteurised products, but we can assume some of each would be in there. Even though your Bnet article suggests the figure for raw milk is higher at almost 200 in 2002, can the claim be trusted if statistics are generated by assumptions such as seems to be the case in the Alexandre Family EcoDairy Farms incident.

* The ""[Boulder county"" article](http://www.coloradodaily.com/ci_15422954#axzz0tsnxJETv) mentions at the end that 60 raw milk dairies exist in Colorado and that claimed food poisoning at just 2 dairies has affected just 36 people in the last 5 years. Assuming the claims are correct, these are pretty small numbers, and nobody's died - it's not another Vioxx scandal, by any means. I'd be interested to find out the food poisoning data for pasteurised dairy and other products in Colorado for some context.

* The Fiji Times story ""Dairy Farms under quarantine"" is about bovine brucellosis (the bovine strain has been eradicated in Australia, just as a point of passing interest). There, with the fourth paragraph all to itself, is the statement 

&gt;""Boiling of raw milk does not kill the pathogen bacteria"" 

What were you trying to prove with this article? Don't you know that pasteurisation is just heating milk to 72C for 15-20 seconds, and not boiling it? If subjecting milk to higher temperature by boiling isn't going to kill the brucellosis pathogen, then what use do you think pasteurisation would be? None at all, obviously!

It's sad to see how, in the last century, fear propaganda has turned people away from foods that nourished the human race for time out of mind and allowed it to flourish, and directed them towards nutrient-depleted, artificial, and low-value substitutes; which have seen the rates of heart disease, cancer, diabetes, obesity, osteoporosis, arthritis, and other chronic diseases keep increasing, despite advances in medical science. Something is very wrong with official food and [medical](http://www.wnd.com/index.php?pageId=41256) advice, and more and more [people are realising it](http://www4.dr-rath-foundation.org/pharmaceutical_business/pharmaceutical_industry.htm), notwithstanding strident attempts to maintain the economically profitable status quo.","but the fda's point addresses a different issue, so your use of it to attempt to imply my friend is a liar is not only rude, but erroneous as well.","rude, but erroneous","rude","but",TRUE,"only rude , but erroneous","erroneous","only",NA,1,"reddit",-0.15207,"thick_moral_concepts_NEG","negative",NA,0,"thick_moral_concepts"

&gt; First Year: He was right. Hermione was a stuck up bitch and what he said was mean and rude but at the end of the day she humiliated him and he reacted like an 11 year old. At the end of the year he sacrificed himself, frankly risking death, in order that Harry and Hermione can go on.

Second Year: He goes to fight Slytherins monster because his friend and sister were hurt.

Third Year: Hermione was a bitch and went behind their backs, didn't even think to mention that she went to speak to McGonnegal. She was also wrong about it being cursed as much as she was right. She also was heartless about Scabbers (idgaf that he was Wormtail, she was still heartless). End of the year Ron stands up to what he believes is a mass murderer ""if you want to kill Harry you'll have to kill me too"".

Fourth Year: Imagine you're Ron. You spend weeks dreaming that maybe you'll be picked for the tournament, yeah you're underage but maybe just maybe you'll get to shine for once publicly and do something none of your brothers got to do. But nah it's your famous bff. He reacts like a normal teenager. You know what though? End of the year there's not one doubt that Voldemorts back despite much less evidence.

Fifth Year: They were right not to write to him, one wrong word could have been a disaster for the Order. Harry was being a child, they were at war. He spends the entire year supporting Harry being a little bitch and then goes to fight Death Eaters at the ministry because his friend had a dream.

Sixth Year: He dates a girl because he thinks Hermione doens't like him. I don't get the big deal here? End of the year faces Death Eaters, again.

Seventh Year: So Harry has no family and Hermione hides hers in Australia with no one noticing cause their muggles, grand. Ron on the other hand by the time he leaves for the hunt has one earless brother and another mauled by a werewolf. He doesn't have to go, Hermione and Harry can't go back to Hogwarts cause mudblood and chosen one. Ron can. Ginny does, Neville does, Luna does. Ron goes on the hunt anyway, putting himself and his family at risk. He's also human and worries about them, then they get a Horcrux, great. By this point his sister has been in a Death Eater ran school for 3 months and 2 of his brothers are being hunted for taking a stand and his whole family is under surveillance, especially worrying as they are involved in a long term lie about him being sick. If they are caught they will be tortured into insanity and killed. He still goes because he knows it is the right thing to do. He also goes without a clear idea of what is going to happen but he goes because he knows his friend has a plan, except he has no fucking clue. Then the Horcrux plays on all of this and he snaps and in a moment of weakness, after hearing his sister was punished at the school she is trapped in ran by Death Eaters and no one but him even pauses to think about it, Harry tells him to go and he does. He immediately regrets it and tried to go back but Harry and Hermione have already left, it's not his fault they didn't wait and he couldn't find them. He eventually comes back, saves Harry's life and destroys a Horcrux, overcoming his insecurities and completing the growth of the most compelling character arcs in the books. He then goes on to help destroy 2/3 remaining horcruxes, fights in the Battle of Hogwarts and is one of only three people to directly stare down Voldemort and defy him (""He beat you"") and continues to fight for what is right, even knowing Harry is dead and being one of only two people who knew the prophecy he actually thought the fight was futile at that point but he kept going because it was the right thing to do.

"Unfortunately, terminally ill and suffering often go hand in hand.  I want to reiterate that I never said I disagreed with you.  I just pointed out that NEVER EVER EUTHANIZING is not always the ""right"" choice, and you sounded rude.

I am going to assume that you truly don't understand how anything you said could have been construed as having better morals.  I'll lay it out for you.  I'm truly not trying to be mean, I'm just making an attempt to explain why people may have issue with what you have said.

1. You asked someone flat out why her 17 year old cat was put to sleep.  That's a little rude, but forgivable, seeing as you may just be very, very curious and less tactful because, hey, it's the internet.

2. After an explanation of some pretty awful issues (for the cat), you tell her you would have put on a topical analgesic and sang to her.  As soothing as that may have been, that only treats the symptoms, while completely disregarding the underlying problems.  A sore mouth is not the only issues that cat would have had.  It came across as rude, and a bit presumptuous, as if they wouldn't have tried various things before they made the agonizing decision to put their pet to sleep.

3.  &gt;""If possible you did that right. I personally will NEVER euthanize an animal.""

Don't you think this could come across as mean or as a condescending?  You then told a story about your grandma who didn't give up and said how if she were a cat she would have been put down.  When you do that, it seems like you're showing an allegorical situation to this woman's, and saying how quick people are to kill animals off... likely including her cat.

While I'm writing this out, I want to point out a couple more things: Your uncle may have had more reasons for putting his dog down than it was just pooping everywhere.  Maybe he wasn't comfortable discussing it.  Maybe it got too hard to explain to everyone.  Maybe it was easier to let people think he was just an asshole than to break down trying to explain how he did so much to save the dog, and in the end there was more and more wrong with the dog and it was cruel to keep the dog hanging on.

Also, painkillers can be hard to keep pets on, so it's not quite as easy to keep pets free from pain when they're sick.  Painkillers often repress an animal's appetite and its desire to drink water.  Combined with already sick pets, this can actually decrease the quality of its life.  With people, we can explain to them why we need them to continue eating and drinking, and it's a bit easier to give them IVs when necessary.","that's a little rude, but forgivable, seeing as you may just be very, very curious and less tactful because, hey, it's the internet.","rude, but forgivable","rude","but",TRUE,"rude , but forgivable","forgivable",NA,NA,1,"reddit",0.17826,"thick_moral_concepts_NEG","negative",NA,NA,"thick_moral_concepts"

&gt; I have had over 70 companies make it sound like I was going to be hired, all of them negotiated pay had me walk inside the building and told me my starting date, they all said that they seen no reason to not hire me, when I double checked with them ""Is there any reason you might not hire me?"" I would ask them and 100% of the time they say no. Then they pick another candidate.

&amp;nbsp;...is bullshit. You have not had over 70 jobs offered to you and then rescinded at the last minute. One or two I'd believe. That happens. It's extremely unprofessional and rude, but it happens. But it **does not** happen over 70 times to the same person.

For some perspective... in one of your comments you said you've only been coding for a year. Let's assume you somehow started (successfully) job hunting the day you started coding (which is also a bullshit assumption). That gives us roughly 365 days. If this has happened to you over 70 times, that means you've literally been hired and then fired once a week every week. Sometimes twice a week. I seriously doubt that's even a little bit plausible.

But let's assume you aren't lying. Then I can only guess that you're misunderstanding the process. There are often multiple rounds of interviews before you receive a job offer. Perhaps you're making it through the first round(s), filling out some more serious paperwork, and then not cutting it in the later stages. My only real suggestion for that problem is more technical studying. I wouldn't be surprised at all that someone with no experience and only a year of programming under their belt wouldn't make it past a second round interview.

"See, what people don't understand is not that The Simpsons doesn't succeed in being funny from time to time - that's not the complaint from Simpsons fans. 

It's that The Simpsons has morphed into a completely different show than the one it once represented. It's characters have warped into complete opposites of what they once were, becoming almost unrecognizable - Moe is now a lovesick loser, when he used to be the surly bartender with a short fuse, Burns is a misunderstood old man with good intentions but ideas that are ultimately poorly implemented, instead of the cutthroat, psychopathic villain he used to be. Not to mention the change in the main characters. Bart used to be the mascot for the show, and that has now shifted to Homer, who has made the most drastic change in character. Before, he used to be the lovable oaf, who was often stupid, insensitive and rude, but ultimately loved his family and would do what he had to for them when it came to the crunch. Now, Homer more closely resembles a mental patient, or someone with a legitimate disability. We laugh *at* Homer now, instead of with him like we used to. 

They can still make good episodes from time to time, even hilarious ones, like tonight's, but the show is not 'The Simpsons' anymore.

"I didn't ""come out"" as an atheist to my family until very recently, because I saw no point in discussing it; I felt it would only place myself in an unnecessarily stressful situation. 

I laugh at the jokes on r/atheism and facepalm at the delusional facebook statuses, but in ""real life"" I try to be a kind, nonjudgmental person. What you do or don't believe in is your own business, and so long as you keep it that way, I have no problem with it. I try not to be resentful of or consider myself intellectually superior to the religious community -- as difficult as it can be -- because I don't want to be an asshole. Most of us have been there, anyway. From experience, arguing from any type of righteous, high-horse point of view (on any side of the fence) tends to make the opposition hold on even more desperately to their position. I'm not confrontational about my lack of beliefs unless it's absolutely imperative.

HOWEVER, my sister is a very loudmouthed, outspoken critic of religion. While I agree with her position on just about every issue, she comes off as rude and demeaning, and she can be a real jerk about it. 

I only came out because she made it easier on me. Even then, I probably wouldn't have come out because I don't feel a compulsive need to talk about it, but my family was complaining about her atheism and bemoaning about where they could have gone wrong to ""raise an atheist"", so I came out mostly as a way of defending her and pointing out that yes, she may be rude, but she's not the irrational one. I had to explain to them that like Christians or Muslims or any other group, there can be bad and good apples. 

After I came out, my parents said some pretty generic, hurtful things (mostly regurgitated fear-mongering).

"“Fucks sake, Ace…” He rubbed his temple slowly.


“I ain’t leavin’ yuh till I heard the whole story!” The younger survivor stood up straight, in an effort to show his stubbornness.


“Fine. I picked the lock, got in, the end.” Nick grunted quickly.


“Nick, that ain’t all to it. Yuh were giving so much passion into it earlier!” Ellis protested.


“Christ, why can’t I remember that. Oh yeah, because I don’t want to remember sharing information to a dumbshit redneck.”


“Start from the beginning, then.” The change in tone caught Nick off guard. It was suddenly soft and soothing. He looked at Ellis for a moment. Hell, the other wasn’t even looking at him. He was just staring at the sunset with that stupid smile. When his blue gaze drifted back to the gambler, he only said, “Take your time.”


Nick looked ahead quickly, letting out a frustrated sigh. The silence clung onto the two for what felt like ages. One part of Nick’s mind yelled at him to say nothing or leave, but another park of his mind told him to just say it. He allowed this to happen, this was his punishment.


“I was in high school.” He tapped the cigarette softly. “It was raining hard that day. My parents were working, again. So, my uncle was going to pick me up. Drunk ass would take forever to come back…”


He saw that excited blue gaze staring into him. He should have been used to it, or at least not cared. But that wasn’t the case. He continued anyway.


“I didn’t want to stay in the rain and risk my health. So I used my tricks to pick at the lock to my history teacher’s classroom. Worked a charm, or it should have. Once inside, I closed the door and slumped into my seat. I didn’t realize that the teacher was still in there as well, since… well, the lights were off.”


He paused to take in more nicotine. He got a reassuring low hum that told him the other was keeping up.


He sighed and continued. “I panicked at first, stumbling in my seat. But he only pulled up a seat next to his desk and invited me to sit. Then I realized that he was smoking. Not that I cared. He still bargained to let me stay in as long as I kept my mouth shut. I sat and he offered me a cigarette. No, I didn’t smoke it. Just held it awkwardly.”


The snicker he heard broke his train of thought. He glared at the Georgian.


“S-sorry…” He was muffling a laugh. “‘s just funny to think of yuh awkwardly holding that when yuh smoke like… everyday.”


“Yeah, I know. Do you want me to finish or not?” the Northerner snarled. When he only got silence in return, he looked at the sky and went on.


“My uncle kept having to pick me up. It kept raining for a few days, so I kept going back. He actually got me to give a shit about history, not like I remember it now, though. In exchange, I kept my mouth sealed and told him my tricks. Sometimes…” He stopped for a moment. He closed his eyes. “It felt like he was the only one who gave a shit.”


Silence made its return to them, clinging onto them desperately. A small whistle from the Georgian made it flee.


“That’s… pretty neat man…” he said quietly. The gambler only huffed with a smirk.


“It was something, alright.” He shook his head.


“‘ey, Nick..?”


Nick hummed, simply waiting for the hit.


“Were yuh a nice kid before..?”


Nick opened his eyes. He hung onto that question for a moment, wondering about it. He spit a response out to hide his thoughts, even if he knew the Georgian could see through him like no one else could. “What can I say? Was born bad, baby.” He looked at the younger survivor and smirked.


Ellis scrunched up his nose. He stood up and crossed his arms. “Nah, Nick. I think yuh were a good kid.”


“Oh my god, spare me your pity…” Nick groaned.


“Nick, ‘m jus’ sayin’. It ain’t like you’re evil anyway, just rude as hell.”


The gambler looked up at Ellis. Even that split second of surprise was too much to show off. He tried to hide behind his anger and growl out a response, but couldn’t get a word out before Rochelle’s distant voice cut them off.


“Boys! Dinner’s ready! We’ll eat your food if you guys don’t!”


Ellis quickly looked up at her and laughed. “Nah, girl, we’re coming!” He waved her off before looking down at the gambler one last time.


“Yuh don’t gotta tell me anythin’, just saying.” The Georgian didn’t allow a response. Instead he practically ran inside to follow Rochelle.


Nick was left to stare off into the distance. He was motionless for a while, maybe not even breathing. He was just thinking. How the hell did the dumbshit even think he was remotely good at all when he’s been nothing but rude and cruel to everyone, even his own team? It upset him for some reason. He clenched his empty hand and growled lowly.


The gambler took in his last bit of cigarette before pressing the bud against the table. He held the smoke in his lungs for a while, then let it flow out.


Good kid. Maybe somewhere inside. Somewhere in that hidden, raw side of him. Ellis wasn’t really wrong. He wasn’t evil, per say, but was rude.


Nick stood up and wandered back into the building.

You didn’t get the eye fuck male gaze. You got the negative/aggressive wtf is that male gaze. The kind that might escalate into something verbal or physical quick. 

It’s a sad reality but if you’re a trans woman and some random guy is staring you down, I guarantee it isn’t cause he wants to fuck you. It means he’s about to start some shit with you. Leave the situation, don’t escalate. 

Trans women need to realize this. You can have the hair, wear the clothes, get gender reassignment surgery - have the outward of appearance of someone dressing traditionally feminine and have a vagina/breasts - but even with all of that, heterosexual men can spot that you’re trans and aren’t sexually attracted to you.

&gt; Two traveling monks reached a town where there was a young woman waiting to step out of her sedan chair.

&gt; The younger monk noticed the woman, said nothing, and walked by. The older monk quickly picked her up and put her on his back, transported her across the water, and put her down on the other side. She didn’t thank the older monk, she just shoved him out of the way and departed.
&gt;

I'm pre-HRT mtf living with my unsupportive elderly parents. I'm currently doing my PhD but due to COVID19 and health problems from anxiety I'm working from home.

A couple of years ago I had tried to transition and make them understand that I had to do it but they became so bad shit crazy screaming that they would die if I did it and ""nobody would support me"" yada yada... and I backed down (which caused my health to go rapidly downhill).

Few days ago I was stupid enough to tell my mother - after her asking me persistently - where I was going to go - to have laser (6th session now). Since then she has been very worried and angry regarding me going out saying that she's afraid I will contact COVID19 and infect them too. And that she doesn't want to die that way.

  
She has set an ultimatum that if I go and have laser again I shouldn't come back and go find a place to rent. Keep in mind we live in a big house and I have tried to convince my father to empty the basement from old apparatus and things he has (unfortunately he's a hoarder) so I could go there while he could go upstairs but he has blatantly refused.

Strictly speaking they can't make me leave and I can't leave in the condition I am (have difficulty walking - adrenal issues, plus being on the verge of crying all day).

Past few months - weeks I've kept my mother on an information diet. A couple of days ago I finally told both of them that we are not going to discuss anything regarding my transition and that it's a personal matter. She got angry saying that as long as we live together she has to know what I'm doing, where I'm going. She also stressed that me saying I have personal issues is rude and that I didn't used to be like that.

So, what do you think? Also, advice on changing my behavior? I don't want to appear rude but firm.

Thanks!

"&gt;not because it is rude but because they care about you

Well, that's the definition of being rude.

You are doing something you know other people don't like because you find it normal or more important than their opinion or well-being.

It feels better if a person is fully engaged in a conversation, looking you into the eyes and reaffirming what you say... even if you aren't talking at that very moment. You contribute (=pay) attention to the conversation. 

&gt;if you are their friend you wouldn't consider breaking off your friendship because they did

If I want to have a private conversation with them and connect to them on a personal level and they start texting, then I feel that they divide their attention between me and something else. This applies to two friends or a group of friends meeting each other. I ask them what's so important and if it's not important, then I ask them why they text instead of talking to me. If they say ""It's not that important, I just replied back for no reason."", then I'll tell them that I'm not comfortable with it as I want to talk to them in a private setting and not be disturbed by some other affairs. If they continue texting, then yes, I will consider giving up such a ffriendship as they show me that other things are more important/just as important as their friends. This has nothing to do with there being an emergency somewhere else.

My point here is that I don't view reddit as the internets unique, beautiful, snowflake, but rather a website that can be whatever you want it to be.

"It is a classic thing you notice when dealing with both Americans and Europeans.


Americans in Europe often describe Europeans to be a little bit cold and unfriendly, while Europeans traveling the US often complain about all the fake friendliness. Both views are true, because of our cultural differences. 


I'm from Central Europe, too, and people can be a bit closed off. But most interactions are much more honest, direct and genuine. What you see is what you get.  
Americans, on the other hand, often appear to be fake and spend so much effort on an apparently skin-deep joviality. But they often are just open, friendly and curious and use positive interactions as social lubricant. They often won't say negative things directly, rather choosing a more subtle approach to get the message across.  
At my company we have people from several European countries and also from the US - it takes new employees some time to adjust to people from ""across the pond"". Americans actually teach other Americans not to take things we say personally - that we are not rude, but just direct and mean well. On the flipside we teach Europeans (mostly Germans and Austrians) to read more between the lines when dealing with Americans and add more niceties.


European and North American countries often get thrown into this huge superculture called ""the West"". But while it appears to be all the same, there are many differences; even within Europe.

Given this, your response was that it is
1. Obvious.
2. the semantic part, which I hope that you understand is a mundane error.

My only response, then, is that what is obvious is subjective. I can also say that your response

""Doing things that piss off large numbers of excitable people that are in your proximity is often rude and dangerous. Doing things that piss off large numbers of excitable people that are far away from you may still be rude, but is less dangerous.""

"As an atheist I have a very simple test to determine if someone is Christian or not: I go by what they say.  Given my lack of involvement in that region (or any religion) I think it'd be not merely rude, but presumptuous and foolish for me to say that someone who professes to be a Christian isn't.

And, of course, as you say we get into No True Scotsman territory that way too.

Some Christian sects (Catholics especially) do provide explicit mechanisms for declaring that an individual is not considered, by the Church officials, to be a member of that sect.  But excommunication, and its various Protestant equivalents, is pretty rare, and that really describes more the attitude of the official church to its former members than the internal processes of the ex-member.

As for ""good morals and values"", that's always a somewhat slippery thing to define.  Most people don't think of themselves as evil, even when they do evil.  I'm sure that most of the people who supported Prop 8 in California were convinced that they were doing what was right.  It'd be nice to imagine them as cackling cartoon villains gleefully plotting to harm their fellow citizens, but I doubt that's true for more than a handful of them.  Mostly the people who do moral evil (such as supporting Prop 8) think of themselves as doing moral good.

Similarly, I'm certain that ""Bull"" Conner wasn't acting from what he considered to be evil motives when he so viciously attacked the civil rights protesters.  Rather, he most likely considered that he was acting from the ""good morals"" of protecting the social order, protecting society from the evils of integration, etc.  

Look at [this photo](http://contexts.org/socimages/2009/10/10/race-mixing-is-communism/), for example, of those who opposed integration.  Note especially the sign that is somewhat obscured by a person's head, it reads: ""STOP the race mixing march of the antichrist"".

The protesters in that picture weren't marching from what they thought of as bad morals, quite the opposite, they were convinced they were marching against immorality and for morality.

Like every other bit of genuine human knowledge, our understanding of morality improves over time.  People 500 years ago were less moral than people today, because they lacked our better understanding of morality.  Just as they were less healthy because they lacked our better understanding of disease.  People in the 1950's were less moral than people today for the same reason: they just didn't understand morality as well.

&gt;But in a relationship, to me, the key value is to fight for the relationship, for each other, and not being willing to give up.

Hmmm, there I think I may disagree completely.  A relationship shouldn't be a struggle, and if it is I think it's probably better to end it.  A certain degree of give and take, of working to make time to talk and whatnot, isn't a bad thing, but if maintaining a relationship becomes a genuine effort why continue it?  

Obviously there may be special circumstances, the relationship between people who need to cooperate because they're coworkers, for example, but even there I'd argue that when the effort of maintaining the relationship gets to a certain point it's better to find a different job and avoid possibly explosive relationship problems.

Even in the case of a couple with children, I don't think I can agree that it's best to maintain the relationship when it gets past a certain point.  Divorce is no good for kids, but it is likely better than parents who do nothing but scream at each other.

The truth is that I do largely agree that people with wildly different values aren't likely to form a good relationship, it isn't impossible I've seen it and likely so have you, but the likelihood isn't that great.

Where I disagree is with the idea that meddlesome people in positions of authority should make an effort to break up a relationship, especially armed with arguments from authority that one person in the relationship considers to be sinful to disagree with.  People make mistakes, that's how we learn.  If the OP and his girlfriend are incompatible, they'll find out soon enough and no harm done.

To me the situation, as described by the OP, looked like a clear and ugly case of atheist/agnostic/non-Christian bashing by youth minister.  ""You're better than those nasty **others**, dump your boyfriend or Jesus won't love you anymore.""  This seems not merely meddlesome, but like an abuse of authority, and for what seems to be genuinely petty reasons.","given my lack of involvement in that region (or any religion) i think it'd be not merely rude, but presumptuous and foolish for me to say that someone who professes to be a christian isn't.","rude, but presumptuous","rude","but",TRUE,"merely rude , but presumptuous","presumptuous","merely",NA,1,"reddit",-0.22793,"thick_moral_concepts_NEG","negative",NA,NA,"thick_moral_concepts"

 However, I completely agree that voidweavers age going to be a sleeper unit. I don't even use the voidweavers to guard a Death Jester after the nerf to Harvester of Torment as I went back to taking a single Jester, but they have the potential of guarding any of our characters, as they can even keep up with a blitzed Solitaire. What I've mainly been using them for is to sit on midfield objectives while the rest of my army positions for a counter attack and flanks along their sides. This forces them to choose between removing a relatively resilient vehicle off of an objective and destroying the things attacking them and causing havoc. If I absolutely HAVE to control an objective, rarely can my opponent remove a buffed up unit of skyweavers AND a voidweaver, even with focusing them down.

Also, between 10 jetbikes, 2 fusion boats, and 2 voidweavers, people see all those fast, scary bikes and vehicles and they tend to forget all about the little slender space elves running about until it's too late.

Setting up an IDE (Eclipse is easier, Intellij IDEA is more intuitive and arguably more powerful but v14 is a bit.. temperamental with ForgeGradle at the moment) and working through some tutorials will be of more benefit to both of you I think.

As for progression I would go; create a new item, then create a new block, then do something clever with the block (play around with redstone, blocklight, metadata, change the icons around based on criteria) then maybe make an ItemBlock to allow you to combine what you've learned. Then move on to a TileEntity - try to make an equivalent to one of the minecraft ones, a chest or a furnace or something - this will introduce you to GUIs and sync issues which are ""tons"" of fun and an interesting challenge to complete efficiently.

Once you've done that, try extending it, make it automatable with ISidedInventory or make it do something wacky with the items inside it.

Additionally - Make the most of open source mods, look at what others have done and try to understand why they've done it that way, generally modders do things a little differently to the tutorials, so try to understand what extra capabilities are added by the way they've done it, as well as any limitations.

Being in highschool I know that this won't really be an option for you, because most 'big' changes in high school are met with teasing and such, but you could just do a military buzzcut. That way you can let your hair grow out to lengths that you've never really seen it, and test what looks good on you and on your facial/body structure. Like someone said earlier, work out. Don't go to the gym and just start pumping iron; but get fit. Athletic. Know your way around your own body so that you can begin exploring the outside world. Don't fall into a clique. Never let yourself feel comfortable by looking the same as the people around you. Be original. Do yo thang, brother.

"The backlash is mostly bullshit. Look at it case by case, and being ""PC"" is just simple courtesy and accuracy--treating people with respect, calling them what they prefer, and using current terminology once you're aware of it.

"Good to hear you're ready to start doing this on your own.  I didn't really learn to start saving until my car died and I had to spend a few months scrounging to pay for a new one.  I've definitely got it down now. Anyway, here are some high-level thoughts.

* There's going to be lots of good advice here but I just want to stress one thing. The most important rule of saving money is to **know where your money is going.** Once you know that then you can actually know how to cut into your spending.  There are a ton of good ways to save money listed here and you can get started right away (read: don't put off saving money) but you won't be maximally effective until you know which spending habits are hurting you the most.  Take a month and write down all of your expenditures.  I mean everything.  Then analyze and go from there.  

* Also keep track of the mediums in which you spend your money.  For me, the biggest hurdle to financial flexibility for me was ATM withdrawals.  I learned that when I have cash in my pocket I spend it FAST.  It's also hard to track how cash is spent out, so it was like a huge chunk of my money was disappearing into a black hole.  Not to mention the ATM withdrawal fees:  $20 a month!  In any case once I started limiting my cash expenditures I started paying more attention to the things I was buying, and started spending less as a result.  I'm not recommending that *you* switch away from cash though; that's just an example of how paying attention to your spending medium can help you big time.

* You're not paying any interest on credit cards, are you?  If so, I don't mean to be rude but fucking stop it right now.   Pay off the CC with the highest interest rate first.  When it's paid, cancel the card and redirect payments to the next card.  You should not have more than 2 CC's and you should carry a 0 balance on ALL of them. When you're done with this redirect the now-large sum towards savings.

* Get yourself to having 3-8 months of your expenditures in liquid savings, then worry about investing elsewhere.

* Find out if your company does 401k matching.  If they do, invest at least that percentage.  It's free money.

* As you get raises in your job, redirect the pay increase towards savings or paying off old debts, and live the same way.

* Don't consider utility costs to be set in stone. Is there cheaper car insurance in your area? Can you manage with a cheaper cell phone plan or cable tv plan? Can you survive with only a cell phone instead of cell+home phones? Do you really need a web connection at home if you have one at work? All of these things can save you big money, but your needs may vary :).

"Well, firstly, I'm going to say that your comments can definitely been seen as racist, or at the very least, very rude. To say ""Why are the Chinese so rude and disgusting"" is definitely not a good way to ask your question, even if you excused genuine hate. Secondly, I'm hoping that someone else can answer your questions better than myself, as, despite living in China for a year, I still feel naive to a lot of Chinese culture.

It's a really different culture. You can't ask why they don't understand common decency because you're thinking about it from what you and your culture considers polite! Chinese culture has very different considerations. When I first arrived in China I was very angry that I would be shoved out of the way to get on a bus. I mean, I'm British, where were the queues!? Then I realised, after missing a few buses, there are so many people that you have to be a little forceful or you'll miss out. Imagine being raised in a family of 15 and cookies only come in packs of 12. Tiny Tim better bring his A Game if he wants some chocolate chip. Despite the pushing, there's still a lot of care. Elderly folk and those with children we're respected and given seats or made room for.  

With regards to spitting. I can't answer much more than, it's considered healthy. I spent a night in a temple and, the next morning, the halls were echoing with the sound of phlegm being coughed up. I learned that it's to remove the badness from ones body. Who am I to argue? Of course, I may feel that it's rude but that's why it's a different, wonderful culture. Shit, if the world said ""Sorry!"" As much as British people, we wouldn't get anywhere. My American wife still laughs when I say ""Sorry, please could I have some water?""

I made lots of cultural mistakes while I was there. I was too forward nod caused a lot of people to lose face. ""DeZoet, would you like to come for dinner?"" I would be asked and sometimes I would reply ""No, thanks."" To not make an excuse and to be so direct, especially in front of others, caused loss of face. In other places I was too polite, and some friends told me this could be seen as offensive as it creates a wall between you and the other person, one that deters true familiarity.

I can't give you an in-depth, Reddit gold worthy explanation reaching back through Chinese history. But I can recommend you go there. See the people, try and witness the culture first hand. It's different, it really is. It will challenge your conceptions of rude and polite and would hopefully make you realise that your standard of living and what is socially acceptable doesn't hold up universally.","to say ""why are the chinese so rude and disgusting"" is definitely not a good way to ask your question, even if you excused genuine hate.","rude and disgusting","rude","but",FALSE,"so rude and disgusting","disgusting","so",NA,1,"reddit",-0.66804,"thick_moral_concepts_NEG","negative",NA,NA,"thick_moral_concepts"

"Your explanation of these beliefs is fascinating, so thank you.

However, I'd like to point out that your assumptions of atheists/agnostics are not very informed and I feel betray a certain amount of close-mindedness on your part. 

Let alone the assumption that atheism is a result of teenagers trying to rebel/establish their identities. Adolescents have always been around, growing up and rebelling as they like to do, but secularization is a very modern thing.

I might be remembering my history wrong, but I thought that in 3000 BC, there were only a small scattering of civilizations complex enough to even have kings or emperors (if they could really be considered that)...I think the first monarchs were only in ~3100 BC or thereabouts.

So how did people start turning from ""God"" to kings and emperors, two ages before these were even starting to exist? Am I getting my history wrong, or does this belief system you've explained reject archaeological and historical records?

Nevermind that the year you mark as the beginning of a decline, not just in spiritual but in moral and social terms, was around the time civilizations began to rise and become stable.

1.
&gt;Yes, annoying marketing people in some parts of the world would like you to think that ""LED TV"" means LED-backlit LCD.

2.
&gt; semiconductor LED displays are still pretty uncommon in consumer applications

3.
&gt; Dark mode is often harder on your battery unless you're using an LED-based display


1. That is *exactly* what a TV marketed as an “LED TV” is.

2. Consumer LED displays are not “uncommon.” Consumer LED displays don’t exist (yet).

3. Naw, buddy. Dark mode is easier if the electroluminescent element in your display is an LED. The only consumer displays containing LEDs are LCDs backlit by those LEDs. In other words, by definition only “LED-based displays” are backlit by said LEDs. See again your comment:

&gt; Dark mode is often harder on your battery unless you're using an LED-based display

When a display is *backlit* by LEDs—in other words, a display with driven LEDs as an electroluminescent layer behind a tinted liquid crystal layer—we call that an LCD. This type of display *uses* LEDs, to be sure and it uses them in combination with a second driven element: an LCD. A **l**iquid **c**rystal **d**isplay.

The electroluminescent layer (you might call this a “lightbulb”) is an LED. It creates light. Like a [lightbulb](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ).

That light shines through a tinted liquid crystal transistor layer which causes that light to appear as one of three (sometimes four) colors.

In this design, “black” takes more energy than “white” (which is not really white, but I’m not going in to the different ways to create the perception of “white”) because we need the liquid crystal layer to turn [on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) to [obscure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) or [block](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) the backlight completely. When the backlight is blocked, you perceive no color, therefore “black”. (Or close to it). When a device is [on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) it generally consumes more energy than when that device is [off](https://www.pornhub.com].

I’ll put that *another* way in case you need an ELI2 instead of an ELI5: when the liquid crystal layer creates an image through reflectivity or tint, white is the *easiest* color to make because the liquid crystal layer is “off” and you can see the light behind it. That light is white. Easy things take less energy to do. Therefore displaying the color white uses less energy than any color that requires obstruction of the backlight.

OLEDs need no backlight. Each pixel is itself an electroluminescent element. Therefore we can organize many OLEDs in such a way that they create a cohesive, driven, display. Each OLED becomes a pixel coordinate in that larger display.

In order to create the appearance of “black” in a display comprised of many electroluminescent pixels, we can simply turn the pixel at a specific coordinate off. That makes the “easiest” color for a display of this design to produce black; a “black” pixel is an “off.” Things that are “easier” take less energy than things that are not easy (or [“hard”](http://www.pornhub.com) if you will). Therefore a display comprised of OLEDs will use significantly less energy when displaying black than when displaying any other color.

Note again that this is the opposite of the way an LED backlit display operates. Therefore your assertion that dark mode is harder when using an LED based display—and your rude comment that I should feel
&gt;sad about correcting someone that's already correct

is not only rude, but laughable, as you were quite incorrect.

For many reasons, biological taxonomy, I think, *does* matter - even in economic terms, biodiversity is a good thing - we may, for example, discover a fish that we currently think of as food actually has medicinal value as well.  To maximize the chances of that happening, you want to keep alive as many species as you can, even setting aside for the moment the bigger point that diverse ecosystems allow for more stable and ultimately profitable resource bases.  But there's a negative externality affecting biodiversity because the choices are made on the level of producers and consumers who, at some level, see one fish as being just as good as another, and because the costs of harvesting a fish and the benefits of harvesting a fish are not distributed to the same sets of people.

"I think the intended effect of segregation was to allow racist white people to stay away from black people, and separating cultures was most likely a secondary byproduct.

Stereotyping is to say ""you are black, so you must be louder in public than someone who is not black."" Stereotyping is not saying that black people tend to be more openly gregarious. An Asian stereotype is that they're all great at math. It is not a stereotype to say that Asians as a group do better at math.

You should not be laughed out of the thread for pointing out that white people are quieter on trains. It probably is non-controversial to say that white culture is more subdued in public. What's ridiculous is to then ascribe these differences in culture to individual differences. It's different to say ""white people are quieter in public because that is their social norm"" than to say ""white people are quiet because they're all so unfriendly."" Differences in culture should be OK to acknowledge and even choose to like or dislike. 

But my point is that racism occurs not when these differences are pointed out but when one is made inferior to another. There are a lot of people in this thread saying ""black people are loud and rude,"" but the loud judgment is very different from the rude judgment. ""Rude""ness is only relative to your own culture--essentially you'd be saying ""this person doesn't live by my cultural norms, so they are worse than me.""

"Most places are overmoderated. I haven't seen this toxicity problem in the years I've been hanging around here. Maybe one or two mildly offensive comments that can easily be handled by community downvotes. 

In the examples of toxicity OP provides there is like a paraphrase of -one- offensive comment that allegedly happened that I see and all the rest are basically at most controversial opinions or people talking about offensive stuff that supposedly happened earlier.  

The OP also singles out comments that are not rude but simply controversial. 

I'd like to see actual evidence of widespread toxicity

I'd like to see evidence aside from hearsay that this sub is hemmoraging people or that theres a bevy of stars that would be here if not for this toxicity problem that supposedly exists. 

This reminds me of Stack Overflow where by far the biggest problem is people mistreat and mass downvote newbies for 'dumb' questions which happens everywhere but the admin is focused on the 'sexier' problem of gender pronouns. Granted I do not have a crystal ball to know whether this indeed is a problem on SO but I've never seen it or any reason why this sort of thing should regularly come up in technical coding discussions and it seems disingenuous when they focus all their attention and proclamations on this while giving little to no attention to the obvious and serious problem you see hundreds of times over and over 

'Toxicity' beyond obvious things like posting swastikas or saying the n word over and over is an inherently vague and opinion based thing.  These newer more broad and expansive CoCs that are all the rage usually end up as blunt weapons in the hands of those with an axe to grind to tailor and shutdown opinions they don't like. 

As a science and technical sub it is important that we allow controversial opinions as much as feasible. In the history of science freedom of thought and expression is a more fundamental value that being comfortable/inclusive (which usually means making one group comfortable included while excluding another). Its sad that scientists have begun to value the latter more and more to the exclusion of the former. We do not want to grow the hivemind which infects much of academia and the scientific community. 

If you want my opinion a far bigger and more important problem that this sub has is that it monopolizes attention and there is a dearth of qualified people in the Beginner ML subs that can help the growing flood of newbies learn or make sense of the confusing material out there. 

Another far bigger problem is people coming here trying to impose CoCs here and every where in science. It frankly starting to seem like the start of some sort of inquisitorial movement. The only time I see toxicity is when people talk about it. 

In the end I urge people to use their reason rather than emotions. If the OP and likeminded say there is a toxicity problem they should actually show real evidence of it. Controversial opinions are not the same as toxicity. Eschew vague and broad CoCs revolving around amorphous concepts and buzzwords like toxicity and inclusivity which can be hijacked for personal ends for simple clear rules 'no personal attacks' etc. Value freedom of thought at least somewhat if not more than creating a 'comfortable' environment.","the op also singles out comments that are not rude but simply controversial.","rude but simply","rude","but",FALSE,"rude but simply controversial","controversial",NA,"simply",1,"reddit",-0.05793,"thick_moral_concepts_NEG","negative",NA,NA,"thick_moral_concepts"
"Japanese people are not ""polite"" and French people are not ""rude"".  What is considered polite and rude is very cultural.  French people are actually, on the whole, remarkably concerned with protocol and politeness, and a big part of the reason that American and Japanese tourists get treated badly is because within the context of French culture their behavior *is* rude.

Americans think Japanese people are polite because most of the things that are considered rude in an American context are things the Japanese would never dream of doing.  That doesn't mean that within a Japanese cultural context, which after all is the appropriate one to go by if you're in Japan, that Japanese people are not rude.  Japanese people can be fantastically rude, but they do it within the context of their cultural norms.  They can be particularly rude to non-Japanese, and Westerners in particular are simply oblivious in my experience, which generally constitutes an even more serious loss of face for the person being insulted.

In general, if a French person is behaving in a manner that you consider rude, there are two possibilities:

1. The most likely explanation is that their notion of what constitutes rude behavior is different from yours.  For example, Americans generally feel that being friendly is the same as being polite.  This is not wrong *per se*, it's just how American people view politeness norms and so really only valid if you're in the US.  Americans smile and try to be familiar and friendly.  French people hate this.  French has a T-V distinction and a large part of being polite is addressing people properly.  In general, using people's first names if you don't know them or not greeting them or not saying please and thank you are far bigger gaffs that not smiling or being curt.  Moral: don't judge what's polite based on your idea of what politeness is when you're traveling.  Politeness is a social thing, and varies from place to place (majorly -- check out the dirty looks you'll get from Russians if you even inadvertently show them the soles of your feet).

2. You've done something rude (see above for examples).  You probably didn't mean it, but the French person you're talking to likely doesn't know anymore about your culture's notion of politeness than you do his, and you're in *his* country.  So you behave accordingly.

"Two traveling monks reached a town where there was a young woman waiting to step out of her sedan chair. The rains had made deep puddles and she couldn't step across without spoiling her silken robes. She stood there, looking very cross and impatient. She was scolding her attendants. They had nowhere to place the packages they held for her, so they couldn't help her across the puddle.
The younger monk noticed the woman, said nothing, and walked by. The older monk quickly picked her up and put her on his back, transported her across the water, and put her down on the other side. She didn't thank the older monk, she just shoved him out of the way and departed.
As they continued on their way, the young monk was brooding and preoccupied. After several hours, unable to hold his silence, he spoke out. “That woman back there was very selfish and rude, but you picked her up on your back and carried her! Then she didn't even thank you!”

"&gt;!I saw that scene in All Might's office in a different way. Bakugo was being super rude as usual but he was also not being malicious. He was just being extremely petty (which he always does) especially when he yelled out that he ""won"" and then you see deku and bakugo bantering with each other back and forth. Although bakugo seems to be acting the same way he always does you can see how relaxed and easygoing deku is around him, which I felt really highlighted the difference in their interactions with each other from the beginning of the series. Deku wasn't hurt by any of what he was saying, he was joining along and saying competitive words like ""I'm going to catch up and surpass you"" as well (however due to his mild and kind personality his words were a lot nicer than bakugo's). !&lt;In the beginning of the series, bakugo wouldn't have even been bantering with deku like that, he would have been a lot more hostile and been a lot more serious with his threats. Deku would have been a lot more nervous and uncomfortable around bakugo. I think with bakugo you have to be able to ignore his disrepectful demeanor around people because his default state is being angry. He's always insulting people and doesn't really seem to know how to converse with others without being rude. If someone shows him kindness, &gt;!like endeavor did when they rescued natsuo!&lt;, he doesn't know how to react. 

I think we're still seeing him slowly develop into a person who will learn how to interact with other people without always being rude, but until then his default state is being a rude and crude guy who's always telling everything to die. However, the people around him who see him often know that he's not truly a bad person (which probably wouldn't happen in real life, so you have to use a bit of suspension of disbelief here), so they're able to look past his rude words and pay attention to the way he's acting instead. I think they probably look for cues in his body language and act according to that.&gt;! And in that scene in All Might's office, if you don't take what bakugo is saying too seriously then you see bakugo and midoriya actually being able to have somewhat of a conversation with each other which is a vast improvement from the beginning where they avoided each other at all costs. I think that's why all might was smiling, since he saw how much they had improved from the beginning of the series, and maybe also just smiling at how far they've both come individually as well. I'll be honest I also thought it was a cute scene because to me it looked like bakugo was showing a rare nice side of him for one moment, since he was calmly talking about the quirks, but then his default personality bursted out as his competitive side flared up when he realized that deku was going to get a quirk that allowed him to do things that bakugo himself had already mastered. And then, since he's a super petty person, he had to flex his superiority on deku and enjoy the fact that he won in that aspect. I thought that whole thing was hilarious because of that. If he hadn't bursted out with that, I would have found it a little out of character for bakugo to be so nice and calm like he was being before, especially since they were talking about how deku was going to get stronger, which should be fueling bakugo's competitive spirit.  !&lt;","i think we're still seeing him slowly develop into a person who will learn how to interact with other people without always being rude, but until then his default state is being a rude and crude guy who's always telling everything to die.","rude, but until","rude","but",TRUE,"rude and crude","crude",NA,NA,1,"reddit",-0.47494,"thick_moral_concepts_NEG","negative",NA,NA,"thick_moral_concepts"

&gt;  Description book **The Good Neighbor by A.J. Banner**:

&gt;  I don't even know where to start in on this shitfest. Honestly. It was terrible. TERRIBLE. For a quote-unquote ""psychological thriller"" that is less than 200 pages long, it took me forever to read, because every other sentence I'd have to stop my eyes from trying to roll out of my head. This was quite possibly the stupidest thing I've read all year, and that includes Sliver, which previously held that esteemed honor. At least Sliver kinda had a plot. This garbage had no plot, no point, nothing. Zip, zero, zilch. Which, thankfully, is also what I paid for it, so I guess all I've really lost is a couple dozen IQ points and two days of my life. I don't really have the energy to recap this book. It's too stupid, and trying to lay it out in a coherent and concise way for anyone reading my review would just take more patience than I have.The plot was non-existent, and the resolution came completely out of left field. Of course, none of the book made any sense at all, so maybe it was just trying to fit in. There were too many characters, and they were all bullshit stock characters, and all of them were OH SO BEAUTIFUL. Breathtakingly beautiful. Stunning, gorgeous, voluptuous (unless one needs to be waiflike in memory!), sultry, etc. Every woman who lived next door to our main character was literally the world's most beautiful woman, and each successful in their own way. First was the model, who was successful at being pleasant to look at. Then there was the art person, who is so beautiful and successful at art that she can make paintings not be burnt anymore. Then there's the real estate agent who is so beautiful and successful that she could sell a house to a... house buying person. I don't fucking know. Didn't I just say that this book cost me IQ points? I rest my case. But to counter all these gorgeous vagina-bearers, there were men. I think. One who... did something? But he's dead now. Another one who looked really grumpy and rude. But he was only there for literally like one paragraph. Supposedly there's another guy... has a kid named after him? Ate dinner once? Yeah him. But then there's JOHNNY. JOHNNY is perfect! He is totally not controlling or creepy at all. I give you exhibit A, which finds us with Sarah (JOHNNY'S wife) following him on a run and watching him go into another woman's house. I had already broken a promise by clandestinely following my husband. You can always trust me, he'd said on our honeymoon. Never question my love for you. I had replied, I promise, and he had squeezed my hand, his gaze clear and unflinching. I want this marriage to work, so you have to talk to me. Tell me everything that's on your mind. Right away. Don't hide anything. Don't omit any details. Johnny would have a good explanation [for secretly visiting another woman's home].Yeah. See? Totally not weird or big flashing warning signish at all! JOHNNY is perfect and leaves newspapers strewn on the counter, and cooks, and leaves crumbs under his chair, but knows that his wife's favorite foods are challah bread and... fucking I don't know, she lost me at challah bread. Is that really a thing? Challah being a favorite food? It's bread. BREAD. Pretty bread, tasty bread, but just... fucking... bread. I wonder if the crumbs are from the bread, and whether JOHNNY'S wife gets upset at the waste. Also: Also JOHNNY wraps his arms around his wife person. Because that is love and stuff. Well that's how you SHOW love, apparently. How you TELL love is this nauseating phrase: ""I love you only."" I think that's supposed to be sweet, in a saccharine fucking nightmare world, but MY cynical ass is like ""Why are you specifying? Got something to hide?"" I kinda feel sorry for JOHNNY, actually, because the author has no fucking idea what to do with him. He is either a perfect husband, or the cheating asshole. The author can't make up her mind, but doesn't have the guts to go full on bad-guy, because you know, then she - I mean the main character, who is totally not author wish fulfillment material - wouldn't have a man, and remember all those beautiful women? They all are validated by men... except the crazy one. So, the moral of this story is: if you don't have a man, you're a psychotic murderer. There were some other people in the book, I mean, names of people, since they never actually APPEARED in the book. But whatever. I'm over the cardboard characters. Let's get to the ""writing"". Because OH GOLLY GEE, wasn't THAT a blast. This... I can't. I had to stop there and go back and put those quotation marks around the word writing in the last sentence. These are a collection of random sentences that occasionally go together, but more often are just bizarrely placed. During dialogue, it's like the people are having two completely different discussions. Random descriptive detail is added at the most awkward times, and things happen, only to be a convenient method of getting to a given outcome, and then the thing that happened will just be completely glossed over or forgotten. For instance, a 4 year old little girl steals a pair of shoes from a store and runs out to lock herself in the narrator's car, where she ""conveniently"" forgot her keys. The purpose of this was to get a teenager who was with them to tempt the little girl out of the car with ""magical princess makeup"" - which the narrator recognizes from the ENGRAVED INITIALS on the lipstick and compact (because apparently people do that?) and confronts her about it, because those belonged to the little girl's dead mother. The fact that the little girl stole shoes is completely forgotten, and in fact later on in the story, she still has the fucking shoes. So not only did her theft and running away go unpunished, even unscolded, but one is to assume that she was actually rewarded for it. But the more pressing matter is the confrontation of the teen who has lipstick that didn't belong to her. Of course. Chapters are ended in the most awkward times, I'm guessing in an attempt at suspense, but it was just pathetic. And speaking of pathetic, I pegged the killer the absolute moment she was introduced, and then every single time she was around, I just couldn't understand how everyone else seemed oblivious to her. Ridiculous. This book was awful. Not the worst I've ever read, but if I'd paid money for it, I damn sure would be getting that refund. Save your time and brain cells and use them on something worthwhile.

"How am I making this seem like I'm wanting someone to feel bad for me? It's disgusting and rude but it's something that literally has/will happen to *everyone*. Every human will have an asshole creep who went to far with something they said.  

Someone asked a question and I responded with something that happened to me. I literally wrote a fact down. 

2+2=4

I've had assholes hit on me.

Each one of these men I mentioned only have said *one* disgusting thing to me before and haven't cross the line of something extreme. And each of these occurrences, I've reported it to a supervisor, making them aware of what they said and who. My managers have banned someone on my behalf because they verbally harassed me, calling me a 'racist bitch', my first two weeks on the job.

Would you call the cops because you're walking down the street and someone stops you, saying, ""damn, I'd like to have sex with you!""

No.. You roll your eyes, think they're an asshole and move on. When you see them again, you know they're a jerk. But if they repeatedly did something, you'd absolutely file a complaint.  They've done nothing since then and I've seen them over 50 times each by now. 

My aunt is the head for her human resources department in her large company. Know what would happen since it's only a one time thing? 

""I had a man comment that he'd like to take me home if he could.""

""That's gross.. What else has he done?""

""Nothing.""

""Has he been disrespectful since?""

""No. They're actually really polite.""

""Did you tell your manager?""

""Yes.""

""Okay. Make sure to write down what they exactly said and on what date. If this continues inform your manager.""

I'm not keeping this to myself, I'm telling my superiors, literal minutes after they happen, I know by name who the comments were from. I'm not going to go above my managers and call corporate over a single comment. My managers can't handle anything because there *is barley anything to handle*. If one of these men made a second comment, they'd do something. A single, mostly harmless and stupid comment is just logged into their heads in case these acts continue.","it's disgusting and rude but it's something that literally has/will happen to *everyone*.","disgusting and rude","rude","but",FALSE,"disgusting and rude","disgusting",NA,NA,0,"reddit",-0.66804,"thick_moral_concepts_NEG","negative",NA,NA,"thick_moral_concepts"
"There are times when it's appropriate to say ""get the fuck over it"". Usually that happens if there's something I don't want to do but need to get done (i.e: homework, obligations, chores, etc.) Or if I have to attend a wedding or funeral and need to dress up very nicely for it, but don't feel like it. Well, tough, those events aren't about me, they're about the people being honored on the occasion. So that's a good time to say, ""get over it."" Usually because how you feel about those events simply do not matter and/or putting your feelings first would be selfish and rude.

But for something like this... yeah, I was taught to think and discuss my feelings, and that for the most part my feelings (and others') are valuable.

But this time, there's two sides to this situation. One would be the guy's, where he doesn't want to have to get up even *earlier* than usual (and maybe he doesn't sleep well with others?), drive home, get ready for work, then go to work. The other is mine, where I'd get that feeling of being left/abandoned even with his logical explanation. Ultimately, communication, even lighthearted communication, would be really helpful here beforehand to get an idea of what both parties are expecting and why. Because really, what makes that hurt isn't just the fact that he's leaving, but that it feels like it's completely out of left field-- that's what gives it kick. If you know beforehand that he has to go at the end of the night, then your expectations can adjust accordingly. Does that make sense?

But yeah, you're probably right. Two different ways of reacting and dealing with something like this.

"For The Little Mermaid, it depends what one's definition of feminism is. The first Part of That World song essentially describes Ariel as having body disphoria. It's easy to apply that song to the transgender movement.

Forgive me. Some people think transgenderism should be part of the feminist cause, and others do not. Without transgenderism, there's not much feminism of note in The Little Mermaid. I'll say that the woman and hero are both women, and Ariel being an interesting female character almost makes it a feminist movie by default because of how hard it is to find those in film. (It's been a year since I've seen Frozen or The Little Mermaid, so it's tough to put up a great defense for them.)

---

Basically the lesson is that I haven't seen very many feminist movies.

I've written a response to that *Frozen* article already, luckily for me. The response is mostly me tearing apart the article without offering my own case for why Frozen *is* feminist, so here it is:

Elsa chooses her own identity. Compare this to something like Disney's *Mulan*, in which Mulan is forced to act like a man.

---

Once again Let it Go is called [award]-bait. Apparently feminists are allowed to take power away from people who they don't think deserve it. And the idea that a character isn't good because they have personality flaws (which actually exist in the real world) is discriminatory to the point of disgust.

The practices described in Let It Go are not healthy but they are logical short-term decisions based on what Elsa has put up with. Eventually she would come around, or could be persuaded to return. Anna came up within the next day. If she waited a week, a month, a year, she'd be more open to discussion. Again, Elsa had just lived her life in a cage, and she can't even go a day without having to be put back in a cage. Of course she'd find that frightening.

&gt;Faced with her misdeeds, Elsa sets a golem on her sister and has to be dragged back to Arendelle in chains when she’s knocked unconscious by her own chandelier. This is not a strong woman. This is a frightened, repressed, vulnerable woman who starts running at the beginning of the movie and doesn’t stop until her sister literally turns to ice in front of her.

Women can't be strong unless they're physically strong? And if you're strong, you're not allowed to be bested ever? If the (male) Avengers are so strong, how come they occasionally face setbacks? Why isn't the movie just the unstoppable Avengers, going bowling and eating pizza, free from any threat?

Strong character to me means well-developed and/or realistic character. It has nothing to do with physical strength or even emotional strength. Don't believe me? A weak character isn't one who can't bench-press 50 pounds - a weak character is one dreamed up in 5 minutes by a toy department.

&gt;Elsa is a relatable antagonist who claims her identity and tells us it’s okay to be an individual.

No. Elsa is a relatable antagonist who claims her identity and tells us it’s okay to be an individual. She also shows us how hurtful individualism and selfishness can be.

The movie doesn't end with Anna's heart getting Frozen, does it? Character development can happen during the whole thing, right?

&gt;Quick trivia question: in how many Disney princess movies is the day saved by True Love’s Kiss™?

Who said that was the question? ""True love"" is pervasive in Disney, in fairy tales, and in culture as a whole. It's a really important concept to address, kiss or no.

The ""It gets worse."" sub-section is probably the worst of this whole article. The well-meaning trolls are comedic interpretations of the well-meaning parents and relatives who hope that anyone brought home or mentioned might finally be what gets them some grandkids.

The trolls are naive. It's a joke. They are rude and they don't know any better. They're desperate for their adopted son to finally have a girlfriend / wife. And do you [the author of the article, that is, not you the reader] really think Kristoff would have nonconsensual sex with Anna? Or that the trolls endorse that? At worst, the trolls say ""get married first and you'll fall for each other later. Just give it a shot!"". So imagine traditional courtship but with an arranged marriage at the beginning. Nobody's getting raped, a troll marriage isn't legally binding (and might be more casual in troll culture than human culture), and neither the trolls nor Kristoff are going to keep her there against her will.

""Her quote engagement is a flex arrangement"" -  this woman is the only chance the trolls have for their son, so they ignore and twist the truth to suit them. Naive and rude, not rape-endorsing.

&gt;And what’s worse is that we agree with the trolls. That moment reads as comedic because the audience isn’t expected to respect Anna’s agency either. We’ve already assumed she’ll end up with Kristoff. We’ve made the choice for her too.

Uh, thanks? I expected that because Kristoff is one of two relevant male characters in the movie, and the movie was so obviously setting up some issue with Hans that he's the only remaining choice (if you assume she marries one). A million other Disney movies are predictable as well.

&gt;And, just like Hans, the trolls don’t suggest the match with Kristoff for Anna’s benefit. The song is about how she can fix him.

""We're only saying that love's a force that's powerful and strange. ... Throw a little love their way and you'll bring out their best.""

Basically, you might grow to like him. Not the best message in the world (again, rude), but if you take the trolls at their word, Anna's getting something out of this.

The writer has the luxury of taking the best elements of past movies and making one super, perfect movie. Frozen doesn't do some things as well as other movies, but the other movies you're comparing it to also aren't as good as Frozen in some other ways. Frozen is all-around good, which is less than you can say for some of the Disney movies that are 90% crap except for the one thing this writer brought up.

**Stick with these sections if you want just the more reasonable arguments:**

* Elsa claims her sexuality as well as her individuality! She’s a modern woman!

So: I want to know why, other than pure narcissism, you are avoiding these comments (I will also explain your mistakes to you once again, just for the sake of clarity):

1.
&gt;Yes, annoying marketing people in some parts of the world would like you to think that ""LED TV"" means LED-backlit LCD.

2.
&gt; semiconductor LED displays are still pretty uncommon in consumer applications

3.
&gt; Dark mode is often harder on your battery unless you're using an LED-based display


1.
That is *exactly* what a TV marketed as an “LED TV” is.

2.
Consumer LED displays are not “uncommon.” Consumer LED displays don’t exist (yet).

3.
Naw, buddy. Dark mode is easier if the electroluminescent element in your display is an LED. The only consumer displays containing LEDs are LCDs backlit by those LEDs. In other words, by definition only “LED-based displays” are backlit by said LEDs. See again your comment:

&gt; Dark mode is often harder on your battery unless you're using an LED-based display

When a display is *backlit* by LEDs—in other words, a display with driven LEDs as an electroluminescent layer behind a tinted liquid crystal layer—we call that an LCD. This type of display *uses* LEDs, to be sure and it uses them in combination with a second driven element: an LCD. A **l**iquid **c**rystal **d**isplay.

The electroluminescent layer (you might call this a “lightbulb”) is an LED. It creates light. Like a [lightbulb](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ).

That light shines through a tinted liquid crystal transistor layer which causes that light to appear as one of three (sometimes four) colors.

In this design, “black” takes more energy than “white” (which is not really white, but I’m not going in to the different ways to create the perception of “white”) because we need the liquid crystal layer to turn [on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) to [obscure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) or [block](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) the backlight completely. When the backlight is blocked, you perceive no color, therefore “black”. (Or close to it). When a device is [on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) it generally consumes more energy than when that device is [off](https://www.pornhub.com].

I’ll put that *another* way in case you need an ELI2 instead of an ELI5: when the liquid crystal layer creates an image through reflectivity or tint, white is the *easiest* color to make because the liquid crystal layer is “off” and you can see the light behind it. That light is white. Easy things take less energy to do. Therefore displaying the color white uses less energy than any color that requires obstruction of the backlight.

OLEDs need no backlight. Each pixel is itself an electroluminescent element. Therefore we can organize many OLEDs in such a way that they create a cohesive, driven, display. Each OLED becomes a pixel coordinate in that larger display.

In order to create the appearance of “black” in a display comprised of many electroluminescent pixels, we can simply turn the pixel at a specific coordinate off. That makes the “easiest” color for a display of this design to produce black; a “black” pixel is an “off.” Things that are “easier” take less energy than things that are not easy—or [hard](http://www.pornhub.com)—if you will. Therefore a display comprised of OLEDs will use significantly less energy when displaying black than when displaying any other color.

Note again that this is the opposite of the way an LED backlit display operates. Therefore your assertion that dark mode is harder when using an LED based display—and your rude comment that I should feel

&gt;sad about correcting someone that's already correct

is not only rude, but laughable, as you were quite incorrect. Indeed your explanation conflated LED, LCD, and even OLED many times over.","therefore your assertion that dark mode is harder when using an led based display—and your rude comment that i should feel  &gt;sad about correcting someone that's already correct  is not only rude, but laughable, as you were quite incorrect.","rude, but laughable","rude","but",TRUE,"only rude , but laughable","laughable","only",NA,1,"reddit",0.28011,"thick_moral_concepts_NEG","negative",NA,0,"thick_moral_concepts"
"\- If you understand free speech in a weird absolute sense, sure, in the same way that not being allowed to yell obscenities in a library is a violation of ""free speech"". 

Again another person which instead of constructively adresing the point attacks and ridicules what i wrote which is provable in next few sentences 

\- Communities have rules so that they can function though, and it's pretty arrogant for someone to wander into a community and demand that their ramblings are given priority over the general interests of the entire community, and argue that the rules shouldn't apply to them. 

If you was speaking the truth you would not say this . I gave my short opinion on what i think about the topic and ive been told iam speaking bullshit . Isnt this closer to yelling obscenities to library , again , no constructive answer and just dumb copying of someone elses work to prove point . You basically just said : its pretty arrogant for someone to wander into community and state their different opinion which we dont like which is absolute opposite of what we want people here to believe . Calling it rambling another word for ridiculing what i said . General interest ? How do you know what general interest is ? Because its being formed . This statement is absolutely against individuality of each person and letting themselves create their own opinion hiding behind role of protector of people who merely fights for general interest . 

\- It has nothing to do with ""lies and deception"", your post hasn't been removed for the content of the ideas but because it broke the rules.  

This is one big lie and deception because rule state :  Please do not solicit psychological, psychiatric, or medical advice. It is unethical for professionals to respond to such inquiries, and those not qualified shouldn't respond anyway. 

And that basically means that my post have been removed for the content of ideas . You lie and deceive. You just used the rules point to hide behind it so it would make you look like you did not violate my rights for free  speech at all because its not about what i wrote but about rules but rules say that you cant state opinion different than what is accepted to be true . This rule is also hiding behind attack on emotion and victimization of these proffesionals calling such people who speak their opinions , unethical , what is supposed to create outrage from other people against violator . 

\- Well they can't read it because it's been removed for breaking the rules. 

This is enforced control and censuring the information . 

\- Asking all users to follow the rules doesn't prevent ideas ""from all sides"" to be presented, why would you think that? 

You can re-read what i wrote in the lies and deception part. It does . Thats why i would think that . You answered by asking me ? What kind of answer is that ? Avoidant . 

 

\- So you're saying that if a knitting community deleted your comment that simply included a link to porn, you'd similarly be arguing that they shouldn't violate your free speech and they should allow people to critically analyze it?

&amp;#x200B;

Well , i see no reason to post such a thing into knitting community but if i posted photo of car or phone it would be less outrageous or it would be ignored at all . What i wanted to point at was that people act like they are ashamed of human body while they crave for sex because its all over the inernet . Last sentence did not belong to part where i stated my opinion about porn but i admit that i did not write it correctly because i wanted to adress the porn part amidst my thoughts about true core of the problem . 

... thus creating half truth by manipulating field of view and deceiving people . What is wrong about porn and human body and act of reproduction ? Do you cover your eyes when going to shower ? These rules you talk about are not to protect but to narrow the view and enforce control . 

Last sentence shouldve been before the porn part so i created confusion which gave you great position to attack me but its all right . 

\- In other words, you think your opinions should trump everyone else's in the community and you shouldn't have to follow the rules. 

You yet again cover behind the rules which basically defy free speech as i stated before . I have right to state my opinion and rules forced you to intervene because of the content of my answers what i proved already .

\- I'm not being rude here but I assume you have a few personal issues. If you have medication please make sure you're following the dosages that have been recommended by a professional, you need to look after yourself. 

Im not being rude but whole time iam ridiculing you and hiding behind rules (which basically says what you should or should not say otherwise you are unethical and you will be ridiculed)  yet again leaving no real counstructive answer or counter evidence . Heres one last ridicule to nail you into ridicule/ rule coffin : you should take your medication . 

&amp;#x200B;

Not only your rules defy free speech , you are enforcer of control and policeman of this illusionary freedom which is in truth controlled environment or should i say in lie ? Lies and deception everywhere protected by rules . Also iam not taking any kind of medication because i know that all  diseases have core in mind and body reflects mind . Iam healthy because i think so and thats what you call placebo effect and cant really explain and call it phenomena or whatever and its just another proof that materialistic world is under heavy influence of mind thus absolutely annihilating all the raional ridiculing points made by guy before . This mightve worked on someone who dont think but i do and iam proud of it . I will not bow because you want to force me to do so . This people is price for true freedom. Ridiculing as you couldve see , violent opposition and what is next ? I cant do otherwise than repeat quote of Arthur Schopenhauer.

 

All truth passes through three stages. First, it is ridiculed. Second, it is violently opposed. Third, it is accepted as being self-evident.

"The accounts of feminists who ""attacked and threatened"" Pizzey are muddy, and in her own AMAs here she more or less admits she has no proof that any threats against her were from feminists. The example of ""harassment"" that she provided was of a particularly ornery female book publisher who told her that her books were worthless and didn't deserve another printing. I don't know if I'd agree with that, and it seems harsh and rude, but that doesn't really constitute a threat. Also, you have to bear in mind that a publisher of scholarly books has every right to reject Erin Pizzey as an authority on anything because she didn't apply academic rigor to her sociological books, and indeed has no type of degree in any stripe of sociology. The whole ""violent feminists and Erin Pizzey"" thing seems to have stemmed from one incident, when she was involved in a radfem group who wanted to blow up a large chain store - I think it was a Harrod's but I can't remember now - and that (pretty sensibly) put her off of feminist groups.

You also have to take the context of the time into consideration. EVERY ""liberation"" group - the Black Panthers are an example that history has made sure comes to mind - talked of violence as a revolutionary tactic in the early 70s. Margaret Atwood has written more than once about Canadian Nationalist groups who wanted to blow up the Peace Bridge between Toronto and Buffalo as a symbolic fuck off for the US. Social change groups all pushed the envelope with that sort of stuff. Very few had the stomach to follow through. Those who did were mostly killed or thrown in jail.

Erin Pizzey can't cite a single example of anyone actually saying to her, ""You can't say that women are as violent as men, and if you do say so, we'll fucking take you out"". She has suspicions, she has theories, and she has (perfectly justifiable) hostility towards people who binned books she worked hard on.

"Thank you! That's very kind. I have considered moving out of London for a variety of reasons, but I'd end up going somewhere north I think. Wouldn't leave the UK.

I first came to London as a wide-eyed 15-year-old craving a 'cooler' place to live than my little coastal town, and I fell in love with the fast pace, the cultural offerings, the architecture.. And these are things I genuinely and thoroughly still love about London, along with the people. I know many consider Londoners to be rude and awful but I've found people to be warm, interesting, welcoming, intelligent, funny. I like the melting pot aspect of this city as well. 

In contrast, Swedes are very cold, reserved and like to keep to themselves and their established friendship groups. Often, they've all grown up together and are suspicious of new people trying to enter the circle. I realised this when I moved back home for a few months during my third year at uni. I had a very hard time meeting people and reconnecting with old friends and acquaintances and their friends were... not outright rude but not very friendly, and not very interested in getting to know me whatsoever. Conversation was forced. I'm a very chatty person who loves asking questions (trained journalist and natural busybody), and I just wouldn't get anything in return. Now, if you speak English and you come from another country (especially US, Canada, Australia or UK), you'll get the royal treatment. People LOVE English speaking people because it's a novelty and exotic and they get to practice their English. You'd see a very different side of things, which is why a lot of people don't believe me when I tell them. Now, naturally, there are tons of really friendly Swedes who are awesome to get to know but they don't seem to be from where I'm from! I much prefer the English, but perhaps it's the same thing there - they're nice to me because I'm foreign and it's more interesting to talk to me than some bird who grew up in Clapham. I don't know.

As for the country itself, that's what I'm missing the most. WOODLANDS. I go to Hampstead Heath as often as I can for that reason. I also miss the sea a lot. I'm going back home soon for a weekend and can't wait to go into the woods and just be. London's way too hectic for me these days and WAY TOO MANY PEOPLE. 

As for whether or not people are happier - I don't know. People are obsessed with status. My mother told me a few years ago that they were having problems in my home town with teenagers selling sex so they could buy luxury items and keep the whole 'Instagram lifestyle' going, and I don't doubt it for a second. It all comes down to who you know obviously but my friends here seem pretty happy, and we don't have much.","i know many consider londoners to be rude and awful but i've found people to be warm, interesting, welcoming, intelligent, funny.","rude and awful","rude","but",FALSE,"rude and awful","awful",NA,NA,1,"reddit",-0.70536,"thick_moral_concepts_NEG","negative",NA,NA,"thick_moral_concepts"

1.
&gt;Yes, annoying marketing people in some parts of the world would like you to think that ""LED TV"" means LED-backlit LCD.

2.
&gt; semiconductor LED displays are still pretty uncommon in consumer applications

3.
&gt; Dark mode is often harder on your battery unless you're using an LED-based display


1.
That is *exactly* what a TV marketed as an “LED TV” is.

2.
Consumer LED displays are not “uncommon.” Consumer LED displays don’t exist (yet).

3.
Naw, buddy. Dark mode is not easier if the electroluminescent element in your display is an LED. [Easy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) is the opposite of [hard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ). Unless is a conjunction, it means “except if” and is used to form a juxtaposition of two clauses.
Therefore what you wrote means “dark mode is harder, except if you are using a display based on LEDs, then the opposite is true: dark mode is easier when using a display based on LEDs”. You further specify what you mean by “opposite” thusly:

&gt;OLED and some other technologies are the exception

The exception to “dark mode is easier when using a display based on LEDs” is OLED? Dark mode is *[harder](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)* when using OLEDs? Not the case, my anvil-dwelling friend.

The only consumer displays containing LEDs are LCDs backlit by those LEDs. In other words, by definition only “LED-based displays” are backlit by said LEDs. See again your comment:

&gt; Dark mode is often harder on your battery unless you're using an LED-based display

When a display is *backlit* by LEDs—in other words, a display with driven LEDs as an electroluminescent layer behind a tinted liquid crystal layer—we call that an LCD. This type of display *uses* LEDs, to be sure and it uses them in combination with a second driven element: an LCD. A **l**iquid **c**rystal **d**isplay.

The electroluminescent layer (you might call this a “lightbulb”) is an LED. It creates light. Like a [lightbulb](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ).

That light shines through a tinted liquid crystal transistor layer which causes that light to appear as one of three (sometimes four) colors.

In this design, “black” takes more energy than “white” (which is not really white, but I’m not going in to the different ways to create the perception of “white”) because we need the liquid crystal layer to turn [on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) to [obscure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) or [block](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) the backlight completely. When the backlight is blocked, you perceive no color, therefore “black”. (Or close to it). When a device is [on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) it generally consumes more energy than when that device is [off](https://www.pornhub.com].

I’ll put that *another* way in case you need an ELI2 instead of an ELI5: when the liquid crystal layer creates an image through reflectivity or tint, white is the *easiest* color to make because the liquid crystal layer is “off” and you can see the light behind it. That light is white. Easy things take less energy to do. Therefore displaying the color white uses less energy than any color that requires obstruction of the backlight.

OLEDs need no backlight. Each pixel is itself an electroluminescent element. Therefore we can organize many OLEDs in such a way that they create a cohesive, driven, display. Each OLED becomes a pixel coordinate in that larger display.

In order to create the appearance of “black” in a display comprised of many electroluminescent pixels, we can simply turn the pixel at a specific coordinate off. That makes the “easiest” color for a display of this design to produce black; a “black” pixel is an “off.” Things that are “easier” take less energy than things that are not easy—or [hard](http://www.pornhub.com)—if you will. Therefore a display comprised of OLEDs will use significantly less energy when displaying black than when displaying any other color.

Note again that this is the opposite of the way an LED backlit display operates. Therefore your assertion that dark mode is harder when using an LED based display—and your rude comment that I should feel

&gt;sad about correcting someone that's already correct

is not only rude, but laughable, as you were quite incorrect. Indeed your explanation conflated LED, LCD, and even OLED many times over.","therefore your assertion that dark mode is harder when using an led based display—and your rude comment that i should feel  &gt;sad about correcting someone that's already correct  is not only rude, but laughable, as you were quite incorrect.","rude, but laughable","rude","but",TRUE,"only rude , but laughable","laughable","only",NA,1,"reddit",0.28011,"thick_moral_concepts_NEG","negative",NA,0,"thick_moral_concepts"

You basically just said : its pretty arrogant for someone to wander into community and state their different opinion which we dont like which is absolute opposite of what we want people here to believe . Calling it rambling another word for ridiculing what i said . General interest ? How do you know what general interest is ? Because its being formed .

This is one big lie and deception because rule state :  Please do not solicit psychological, psychiatric, or medical advice. It is unethical for professionals to respond to such inquiries, and those not qualified shouldn't respond anyway.

You just used the rules point to hide behind it so it would make you look like you did not violate my rights for free  speech at all because its not about what i wrote but about rules but rules say that you cant state opinion different than what is accepted to be true . This rule is also hiding behind attack on emotion and victimization of these proffesionals calling such people who speak their opinions , unethical , what is supposed to create outrage from other people against violator . 

\- Well they can't read it because it's been removed for breaking the rules. 

This is enforced control and censuring the information . 

\- Asking all users to follow the rules doesn't prevent ideas ""from all sides"" to be presented, why would you think that? 

You can re-read what i wrote in the lies and deception part. It does . Thats why i would think that . You answered by asking me ? What kind of answer is that ? Avoidant . 

 

\- So you're saying that if a knitting community deleted your comment that simply included a link to porn, you'd similarly be arguing that they shouldn't violate your free speech and they should allow people to critically analyze it?

&amp;#x200B;

Well , i see no reason to post such a thing into knitting community but if i posted photo of car or phone it would be less outrageous or it would be ignored at all . What i wanted to point at was that people act like they are ashamed of human body while they crave for sex because its all over the inernet . Last sentence did not belong to part where i stated my opinion about porn but i admit that i did not write it correctly because i wanted to adress the porn part amidst my thoughts about true core of the problem . 

... thus creating half truth by manipulating field of view and deceiving people . What is wrong about porn and human body and act of reproduction ? Do you cover your eyes when going to shower ? These rules you talk about are not to protect but to narrow the view and enforce control . 

Last sentence shouldve been before the porn part so i created confusion which gave you great position to attack me but its all right . 

\- In other words, you think your opinions should trump everyone else's in the community and you shouldn't have to follow the rules. 

You yet again cover behind the rules which basically defy free speech as i stated before . I have right to state my opinion and rules forced you to intervene because of the content of my answers what i proved already .

\- I'm not being rude here but I assume you have a few personal issues. If you have medication please make sure you're following the dosages that have been recommended by a professional, you need to look after yourself. 

Im not being rude but whole time iam ridiculing you and hiding behind rules (which basically says what you should or should not say otherwise you are unethical and you will be ridiculed)  yet again leaving no real counstructive answer or counter evidence . Heres one last ridicule to nail you into ridicule/ rule coffin : you should take your medication . 

&amp;#x200B;

Not only your rules defy free speech , you are enforcer of control and policeman of this illusionary freedom which is in truth controlled environment or should i say in lie ? Lies and deception everywhere protected by rules . Also iam not taking any kind of medication because i know that all  diseases have core in mind and body reflects mind . Iam healthy because i think so and thats what you call placebo effect and cant really explain and call it phenomena or whatever and its just another proof that materialistic world is under heavy influence of mind thus absolutely annihilating all the raional ridiculing points made by guy before . This mightve worked on someone who dont think but i do and iam proud of it . I will not bow because you want to force me to do so . This people is price for true freedom. Ridiculing as you couldve see , violent opposition and what is next ? I cant do otherwise than repeat quote of Arthur Schopenhauer.

 

All truth passes through three stages. First, it is ridiculed. Second, it is violently opposed. Third, it is accepted as being self-evident.

"So lying is ilegal? Then all politicians should be put into prison (not a bad idea really). As I said to someone else in this thread:

The necessary limitations on free speech occur when there is quantifiable damage, like in a defamation lawsuit where you can show the action harming your ability to earn a living, or with freedom of expression the line gets drawn at snuff films and child pornography because crimes must be committed in order to create the content, that is, real people being hurt.

When we talk about hate speech we are talking about opinions. The opinions may be horrible, ignorant, and incredibly rude, but telling people they cannot voice said opinion is akin to telling them they are not allowed to have that opinion, which is getting into the territory of telling people what they are allowed to think.

A simple look at history shows why it is important to protect everyone's right to freedom of speech. In the dark ages you had scholars imprisoned for suggesting the earth is round, the equivalent of a flat earther in our time, an idea that contradicted basic scientific knowledge of that era. Then there was the inquisition and the protestant reformation where people were executed publicly and brutally over religion, ideas based on belief that can be neither proven nor disproven, it was the reason the americas founders wanted a separation of church and state. And history is littered with the corpses of people murdered by tyrants for speaking out against them.

Free speech is the lifeblood of academics, culture, and politics, infringing upon it does incredible harm that far outweighs any emotional damage an individual or group may experience.","the opinions may be horrible, ignorant, and incredibly rude, but telling people they cannot voice said opinion is akin to telling them they are not allowed to have that opinion, which is getting into the territory of telling people what they are allowed to think.","rude, but telling","rude","but",TRUE,"ignorant , and incredibly rude","ignorant","incredibly",NA,0,"reddit",-0.45899,"thick_moral_concepts_NEG","negative",NA,NA,"thick_moral_concepts"

&gt; Two traveling monks reached a town where there was a young woman waiting to step out of her sedan chair.

They had nowhere to place the packages they held for her, so they couldn’t help her across the puddle.

&gt; The younger monk noticed the woman, said nothing, and walked by. The older monk quickly picked her up and put her on his back, transported her across the water, and put her down on the other side. She didn’t thank the older monk, she just shoved him out of the way and departed.
&gt;
&gt; As they continued on their way, the young monk was brooding and preoccupied. After several hours, unable to hold his silence, he spoke out. “That woman back there was very selfish and rude, but you picked her up on your back and carried her! Then she didn’t even thank you!”

To say ""Why are the Chinese so rude and disgusting"" is definitely not a good way to ask your question, even if you excused genuine hate. Secondly, I'm hoping that someone else can answer your questions better than myself, as, despite living in China for a year, I still feel naive to a lot of Chinese culture.

It's a really different culture. You can't ask why they don't understand common decency because you're thinking about it from what you and your culture considers polite! Chinese culture has very different considerations. When I first arrived in China I was very angry that I would be shoved out of the way to get on a bus. I mean, I'm British, where were the queues!? Then I realised, after missing a few buses, there are so many people that you have to be a little forceful or you'll miss out. Imagine being raised in a family of 15 and cookies only come in packs of 12. Tiny Tim better bring his A Game if he wants some chocolate chip. Despite the pushing, there's still a lot of care. Elderly folk and those with children we're respected and given seats or made room for.  

With regards to spitting. I can't answer much more than, it's considered healthy. I spent a night in a temple and, the next morning, the halls were echoing with the sound of phlegm being coughed up. I learned that it's to remove the badness from ones body. Who am I to argue? Of course, I may feel that it's rude but that's why it's a different, wonderful culture. Shit, if the world said ""Sorry!"" As much as British people, we wouldn't get anywhere. My American wife still laughs when I say ""Sorry, please could I have some water?""

I made lots of cultural mistakes while I was there. I was too forward nod caused a lot of people to lose face. ""DeZoet, would you like to come for dinner?"" I would be asked and sometimes I would reply ""No, thanks."" To not make an excuse and to be so direct, especially in front of others, caused loss of face. In other places I was too polite, and some friends told me this could be seen as offensive as it creates a wall between you and the other person, one that deters true familiarity.

I can't give you an in-depth, Reddit gold worthy explanation reaching back through Chinese history. But I can recommend you go there. See the people, try and witness the culture first hand.

"So let me get this straight:

- You have never performed any sort of evocation before, meaning you have no skill in this area, and may not get any results, but you're still choosing it as your chosen method of verification.
- You're doing it in a graveyard where a bird rustling in the branches of a tree is probably going to make you all shit bricks and think it worked whether it did or not.
- You're choosing a demon for your evocation, meaning that even if your scepticism were entirely correct and such things didn't exist, you'd probably lay the seeds in your mind to spend a long time worrying about what happened or didn't happen - and if your scepticism proves to be misguided, you're inviting an entity that is more than happy to fuck you (and not in the fun kinky way) into your life. You're also doing it in a rude and unprofessional manner, meaning said demon has even more of an excuse to delivering an ass whooping. You're also doing it at a burial grounds, meaning probably engendering an ass-whooping from a whole lot of other local spirits too.

This all reeks of someone whose impression of the occult is Ouija boards and horror movies, or paranormal investigation documentaries.

---

I really hope you don't take this as me being rude, but literally everything about your plan is pretty much a bad idea.

Okay, so now to propose a solution:

- If you really want to perform any sort of evocation, and get your evidence, you're going to have to be a little more patient. While you might not have the patience for years of study, you could certainly pick up a copy of **Franz Bardon's Practice of Magical Evocation** and read that from cover to cover before doing anything.
- If you just want quick proof that there's more to this world than meets the eye, then there's a simple and easy way to do this. Today, out loud, ask the universe, God, your relevant deity in question, your subconscious, whichever of those seems most fitting to you - for some kind of proof. Say it out loud, and specify that you are giving him/her/it one week to answer a question of your choice. Now, this is where the hardest part of this simple method comes in, you must, sincerely, give it the benefit of the doubt, put your previous scepticism aside and say ""Alright, for one week, I'll completely get behind this idea, and give it some belief, and if I see my proof, I'll accept it. If I don't, I go back to the way I was before. Simple"". At some point during the week you are going to feel drawn to a particular book, maybe one you own, maybe one in a library, or one that a friend shows you. You'll know when. At that point, open the book, to the page you feel like opening it to. Now read. Was the answer suitable? ;) I have never seen this method fail once and it probably has a higher rate of converting sceptics to believers than anything else I know of.
- Back to evocation, if you must start already, start with benevolent entities. The angels/archangels, friendly nature spirits, deceased ancestors/relatives of yours that you were on good terms with. Don't go to them just for proof, but think of something they could genuinely help you with, and when performing the evocation, petition them for it. See with little experience in occult practice you probably aren't going to see or hear anything at this stage, at best you might feel some kind of presence. You can however verify if you succeeded by if they answer your request. A good simple one is ask to receive a nice surprise of some kind during the next 24 hours. If you aren't sure what to pick out of angels, archangels, nature spirits, or other benevolent entities, my advice is trying one of the archangels. They're pretty accommodating and won't be annoyed by someone inexperienced or sceptical calling upon them, and will usually answer your request or point you in the right direction to answer it yourself.

I suggest the instructions in the Franz Bardon book I mentioned, but if you're working with the archangels, the process of their evocation can be as simple as chanting or vibrating (resonating your voice, a bit like when you hear monks chanting ""OMMMM"") their name repeatedly 3-4 times. After you have done this, whether you feel like they've arrived or not, act as if they have. Greet them, state your intentions, ask for whatever help you need, then thank them for helping you (yes, you should thank any entities you ask for help **before** you receive it, as if it was already received. This is a token of you having faith that they'll complete your request.), bid them farewell, and let things be.

Almost forgot, four archangels that you may already be familiar with and that are suitable for general requests (albeit all having their own speciality): Raphael, Michael, Gabriel, Uriel. When you vibrate the names, vibrate each syllable, i.e. ""RA-PHA-EL"". I recommend 4 times, and then making your request as stated above.

Hope this helps. :)

"Try to avoid ""So, do you come here often?"" type lines. 

I find it way better to start with some humor. Jokes are hard but poking fun at others isn't. If you're in a bar you could say something like ""Check it out that guy's sweater it's straight out of the 50's"". Or, ""Looks like that guy over is getting laid tonight"" (with or without sarcasm). Or ""Damn, I might have to go for double popped collars next time too, like that guy"" (sarcasm). ""Do you have a camera on your phone?"" - ""Euh yeah, why?""  - ""I want to get a photo of that guy's mullet / 'great' hair do, I'm getting a haircut myself tomorrow"". These are not chat up lines but a good way to fill a conversation and make her laugh. 

Girls love spying and commenting on other people's behavior and provided you don't overdo it and sound like a gay fashion designer, it's a great way to break the ice.

Girls also go for the funny / mysterious / slightly arrogant type alot more than the ""nice guys"" who spend the entire evening buying drinks, being polite and agreeing with everything she says. 

Get a drink for yourself and come back saying ""Sorry, you drink way too fast for me"" or ""You don't like _insert drink here_ anyway right?"" (while she blatantly does). The former line will set her back, worrying if she appears to be an alcoholic, and then she'll appreciate anyting nice you say after that so much more (""phew, I don't look like a freak""). 

This is being borderline rude but when tipsy she'll just try to figure out what that all meant exactly, and the intrigue starts there. Obviously the setting needs to be right and you need to say this with a slight smirk.

Also, offsetting your arrogance with self mocking works really well. Saying something like ""Shit, if I get on that dance floor you'd be embarrassed to have even spoken to me!"" should crack her up.

After you've been making small talk for a bit, ask: ""Could I just ask your for a sec: I have to buy a gift for a real close female friend I've known for years and I'm thinking of X. Would YOU like to get that as a gift?"". Girls love chatting about this stuff and it will make you seem considerate, trustworthy cause you have a close female friend and it's an entirely plausible question to ask a stranger.","this is being borderline rude but when tipsy she'll just try to figure out what that all meant exactly, and the intrigue starts there.","rude but when","rude","but",FALSE,"rude but when tipsy","tipsy",NA,"when",1,"reddit",0.13843,"thick_moral_concepts_NEG","negative",NA,NA,"thick_moral_concepts"

not all atheists are alike, just like not all christians are alike. this would be out group dynamics at work. it's a mentality that religion particularly causes. WE are unique individuals with differing view points, we are people. THEY are the same all one, the unformed uniform OTHER.
We don't think you have the 'Truth' (tm). we think you are wrong. some of us try to convince others of that, some of us don't. Some of us are rude, some of us are not. But when you consider we are talking about an entire _world view_ a conceptual framework you hang your sense of self upon, even the most casual of disagreement seems rude. 'we think you are wrong' is not rude, but more then one christians complaint around atheism stems from no more then that.

""They also told me that atheists are only atheists because something traumatic happen to them and they hate God for it.""

do you hate Thor? what caused you to hate Thor?

this is a projection. Most christians, being christians, view the world from within there world view. when you see someone saying 'i don't believe in god and these claims of morality and these actions stemming from this belief is wrong' many would say 'well how could someone say these things...how could someone like *me* possibly say something like that? they must be angry at god'. it's an inability to view things from another perspective rather then an intentional misunderstanding.

/ B. Legal and licensed means to view DVD formats as well as any popular proprietary media format out there are available. If this post were truly here to educate Linux users in Canada and elsewhere, then the OP could have endorsed the support of Linux developers. 

/C. there are so many formats out there that are absolutely better than the mainstream in every way that are completely open source. Endorse these methods and as a bonus, your songs sound better than some mp3 format.

/D. The fundamentally lost idea to most new Linux users is that the community was never about free as in beer only. The community absolutely encourages the support of developers who have created legitimate software for Linux.

"I don't believe that  [u](https://www.reddit.com/user/axolotl_peyotl/)/axolotl\_peyotl genuinely cares about r/UFOs.

He has long since stopped performing even the most perfunctory mod duties here.

His sole activity in this series of events was to foment a torches and pitchforks kind of furore on other subs.

He does not know what reasoning ASK47 had for removing the Rio posts. He did not contact the mods here at  all in mod chat or anywhere else, he unilaterally opened up the automod script here, he took the list of mod actions done and published them on another sub. How is that in any way a professional or ethical thing to do? He communicated his actions more to randos than to the mods here.

The only times I've seen axolotl\_peyotl on the mod mail comms is to talk shit about r/UFOs months ago. It may have been longer.

It seems to me that he is misrepresenting the facts. I challenged him on this in the other thread. I suggested he was being unethical, that he was using his position in a hypocritical way. He didn't answer that challenge, he instead came and made this thread after an hour or two. There's a word for that behaviour, but apparently people get unreasonably upset if I speak too plainly.

He presents himself here as taking the moral high ground, but what he's really done is hold on to a mod status that he doesn't use - he does not moderate this sub, timmy and ASK do nearly all of the work - and use it to his advantage in manipulating the people who listen to him in his other sub for opaque reasons. No, I don't accept his justifications on their face, because he has not been open with his concerns privately with the mods here.

He's undermining any principles he claims to have in doing so. He came into the sub which he doesn't even post in let alone moderate and altered the automod script. I don't see that as an ethical or principled thing to do. He published the data of the internal mod actions on another sub.

Yeah, I handled the thread yesterday poorly, to say the least, and I shot my mouth off when I didn't have the full info. I thought accusations of removal of threads were false, and said so, because I didn't see them in the log. I was wrong. Boy did you let me know it.

Yes, I was rude, because of what I saw as abusive messages in the post, and that was out of order. I didn't see the origins or reasons for people being upset, because I hadn't seen the series of events that had transpired. I saw what I thought was a concerted attempt at trolling and flipped out. I absolutely do feel shit for doing that, right in the guts, I know I fucked up.

I said r/conspiracy is a cesspool. Frankly that is my honest personal opinion. I don't see that my moderation position requires me to withhold my personal opinions of this nature, and obviously axolotl\_peyotl agrees, because he's says what he thinks about r/UFOS, right?

axolotl\_peyotl also told you that the keywords in the automod script were permanent, but how does he know this? How does he know that they aren't going to be removed after the flood of new posts has been dealt with? In this sub, when a news story comes out, we get multiple reposts of the same story in a short period of time, which is one of the things we were asked to deal with. I pointed this out to him and he said nothing.

Once again, axolotl\_peyotl doesn't have the full picture, and barged into the sub's moderation code and altered it without talking to ASK47 or timmy242, and *he told you something that he couldn't know was true*.

He does not have clean hands in this. What are his true motivations? I haven't the faintest idea. But if I had no particular opinion of his character before, I certainly do now.

I called the actions of some people stupid. That was rude of me, but the statement was accurate.

The way some people here have conducted themselves over this Rio hoax - and it is a hoax - is downright childish. Like screaming bloody idiots. The abusive reactions were absolutely pathetic, and it is to my shame that I reacted emotionally in response. But I stand by saying that these people should have acted like adults and not hysterics imagining some grand conspiracy. There isn't any. I see that axolotl\_peyotl's posts on r/conspiracy went some way to stirring up that hysteria. You should all be ashamed of yourselves.

Should the thread about the Rio Event have staid up? IMHO yes. I don't think there's anything to the story and the videos are garbage. The main promoters of the story appear to be promoting a hoax, maybe knowingly. Does that mean it should have been culled? In my opinion no, but I didn't make the call and I will not change the actions of another mod, because that is not ethical. I'm not going to undermine someone else's decision in that way, it is not my place.

This upset could have been dealt with better, and I am mostly to blame for being particularly dense and typically rude, but axolotl\_peyotl has created much more drama by trying to foment this unpleasantness by presenting the information he obtained through the retaining of his mod permissions in an unethical way. I'll go even further: the word for it is corrupt.

I am a lot of things. I'm an asshole. I'm cynical and misanthropic. I'm arrogant and difficult to like. But I'm not bloody corrupt and I've never censored anything in my life.

I am absolutely OK with being unmodded from the sub. I throw myself upon the mercy of the court.

But axolotl\_peyotl  should unmod himself from the sub that he has clearly shown he viscerally despises and remove all moderation permissions he has here.

What I've seen shows me a mean and vindictive man who will abuse the rights he holds for personal reasons. If he really has principles, he will do this. I predict he will not.

"My personal favorite is the 6th Doctor, Colin Baker, but I am in the EXTREME minority on this one. 6 is generally disliked even by longtime Whovians like myself, but I love him as an actor and think he did great considering his time and circumstances: The head of the BBC was actively trying to kill the series, and it was the first attempt to make a ""darker"" Doctor (well 4 had his dark side but very understated.), and a lot of people didn't get it after 3 years of the boyish charm and straightlaced heroics of 5. I like him because he brought back the ""alienness""  and mystery that I felt had been missing from Davison's era (Doctor #5) and I liked that he was unstable and rude but that's me. Most people seem to prefer more of a straight heroic instead of an anti-hero type Doctor (like 6 or 9 or even 7 come to think of it, but by his time the production values and writing were so abysmal that it's hard to tell sometimes what they were going for with him). Most longtime fans prefer the 4th (the one with the scarf, longest running, considered the ""golden gothic"" era of Who), 3rd or 5th Doctors from the classic series pretty much in that order, but it seems since New Who that everyone loves Tennant most, and I won't say he doesn't deserve it because I liked him a lot, but I liked Eccleston better (I know I'm weird).

"Have all the players make a will save. Pass a private note to everyone except the one with the lowest save (I'll refer to him as Bob), explaining what is about to happen.

From Bob's perspective, nothing now changes. He and the rest of the party are just standing in a seemingly normal room. However, the rest of the party starts to act differently towards him. It starts out as just mean-spirited and rude, but soon becomes outright hostile. Bob will eventually have to fight back against the players. Fudge their rolls so that Bob doesn't get hurt very much (attacks either miss often or don't do much damage), but make it so that Bob will eventually kill the entire rest of the party. This solves the puzzle.

Although Bob didn't sense it, when he failed his Will save, he actually fell to the ground and entered a dream state. The rest of the party is actually perfectly safe, but Bob can't discover this until he's killed the rest of the ""dream party"" and woken up from his stupor. 

If all goes well (and the other players are into it), Bob (the player) will start to feel paranoid and uncomfortable as all of this is happening, and will probably feel terrible about having to kill everyone else's characters, only to discover that none of it actually happened.

So: I want to know why, other than pure narcissism, you are avoiding these comments (I will also explain your mistakes to you once again, just for the sake of clarity):

1.
&gt;Yes, annoying marketing people in some parts of the world would like you to think that ""LED TV"" means LED-backlit LCD.

2.
&gt; semiconductor LED displays are still pretty uncommon in consumer applications

3.
&gt; Dark mode is often harder on your battery unless you're using an LED-based display


1. That is *exactly* what a TV marketed as an “LED TV” is.

2. Consumer LED displays are not “uncommon.” Consumer LED displays don’t exist (yet).

3. Naw, buddy. Dark mode is easier if the electroluminescent element in your display is an LED. The only consumer displays containing LEDs are LCDs backlit by those LEDs. In other words, by definition only “LED-based displays” are backlit by said LEDs. See again your comment:

&gt; Dark mode is often harder on your battery unless you're using an LED-based display

When a display is *backlit* by LEDs—in other words, a display with driven LEDs as an electroluminescent layer behind a tinted liquid crystal layer—we call that an LCD. This type of display *uses* LEDs, to be sure and it uses them in combination with a second driven element: an LCD. A **l**iquid **c**rystal **d**isplay.

The electroluminescent layer (you might call this a “lightbulb”) is an LED. It creates light. Like a [lightbulb](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ).

That light shines through a tinted liquid crystal transistor layer which causes that light to appear as one of three (sometimes four) colors.

In this design, “black” takes more energy than “white” (which is not really white, but I’m not going in to the different ways to create the perception of “white”) because we need the liquid crystal layer to turn [on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) to [obscure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) or [block](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) the backlight completely. When the backlight is blocked, you perceive no color, therefore “black”. (Or close to it). When a device is [on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) it generally consumes more energy than when that device is [off](https://www.pornhub.com].

I’ll put that *another* way in case you need an ELI2 instead of an ELI5: when the liquid crystal layer creates an image through reflectivity or tint, white is the *easiest* color to make because the liquid crystal layer is “off” and you can see the light behind it. That light is white. Easy things take less energy to do. Therefore displaying the color white uses less energy than any color that requires obstruction of the backlight.

OLEDs need no backlight. Each pixel is itself an electroluminescent element. Therefore we can organize many OLEDs in such a way that they create a cohesive, driven, display. Each OLED becomes a pixel coordinate in that larger display.

In order to create the appearance of “black” in a display comprised of many electroluminescent pixels, we can simply turn the pixel at a specific coordinate off. That makes the “easiest” color for a display of this design to produce black; a “black” pixel is an “off.” Things that are “easier” take less energy than things that are not easy (or [“hard”](http://www.pornhub.com) if you will). Therefore a display comprised of OLEDs will use significantly less energy when displaying black than when displaying any other color.

Note again that this is the opposite of the way an LED backlit display operates. Therefore your assertion that dark mode is harder when using an LED based display—and your rude comment that I should feel
&gt;sad about correcting someone that's already correct

is not only rude, but laughable, as you were quite incorrect. Indeed your explanation conflated LED, LCD, and even OLED many times over.","therefore your assertion that dark mode is harder when using an led based display—and your rude comment that i should feel &gt;sad about correcting someone that's already correct  is not only rude, but laughable, as you were quite incorrect.","rude, but laughable","rude","but",TRUE,"only rude , but laughable","laughable","only",NA,1,"reddit",0.28011,"thick_moral_concepts_NEG","negative",NA,0,"thick_moral_concepts"

"The accounts of feminists who ""attacked and threatened"" Pizzey are muddy, and in her own AMAs here she more or less admits she has no proof that any threats against her were from feminists. The example of ""harassment"" that she provided was of a particularly ornery female book publisher who told her that her books were worthless and didn't deserve another printing. I don't know if I'd agree with that, and it seems harsh and rude, but that doesn't really constitute a threat. Also, you have to bear in mind that a publisher of scholarly books has every right to reject Erin Pizzey as an authority on anything because she didn't apply academic rigor to her sociological books, and indeed has no type of degree in any stripe of sociology. The whole ""violent feminists and Erin Pizzey"" thing seems to have stemmed from one incident, when she was involved in a radfem group who wanted to blow up a large chain store - I think it was a Harrod's but I can't remember now - and that (pretty sensibly) put her off of feminist groups.

You also have to take the context of the time into consideration. EVERY ""liberation"" group - the Black Panthers are an example that history has made sure comes to mind - talked of violence as a revolutionary tactic in the early 70s. Margaret Atwood has written more than once about Canadian Nationalist groups who wanted to blow up the Peace Bridge between Toronto and Buffalo as a symbolic fuck off for the US. Social change groups all pushed the envelope with that sort of stuff. Very few had the stomach to follow through. Those who did were mostly killed or thrown in jail.

Erin Pizzey can't cite a single example of anyone actually saying to her, ""You can't say that women are as violent as men, and if you do say so, we'll fucking take you out"". She has suspicions, she has theories, and she has (perfectly justifiable) hostility towards people who binned books she worked hard on.

"I'm sorry... but this

&gt; I have had over 70 companies make it sound like I was going to be hired, all of them negotiated pay had me walk inside the building and told me my starting date, they all said that they seen no reason to not hire me, when I double checked with them ""Is there any reason you might not hire me?"" I would ask them and 100% of the time they say no. Then they pick another candidate.

&amp;nbsp;...is bullshit. You have not had over 70 jobs offered to you and then rescinded at the last minute. One or two I'd believe. That happens. It's extremely unprofessional and rude, but it happens. But it **does not** happen over 70 times to the same person.

For some perspective... in one of your comments you said you've only been coding for a year. Let's assume you somehow started (successfully) job hunting the day you started coding (which is also a bullshit assumption). That gives us roughly 365 days. If this has happened to you over 70 times, that means you've literally been hired and then fired once a week every week. Sometimes twice a week. I seriously doubt that's even a little bit plausible.

But let's assume you aren't lying. Then I can only guess that you're misunderstanding the process. There are often multiple rounds of interviews before you receive a job offer. Perhaps you're making it through the first round(s), filling out some more serious paperwork, and then not cutting it in the later stages. My only real suggestion for that problem is more technical studying. I wouldn't be surprised at all that someone with no experience and only a year of programming under their belt wouldn't make it past a second round interview.

"Japanese people are not ""polite"" and French people are not ""rude"".  What is considered polite and rude is very cultural.  French people are actually, on the whole, remarkably concerned with protocol and politeness, and a big part of the reason that American and Japanese tourists get treated badly is because within the context of French culture their behavior *is* rude.

Americans think Japanese people are polite because most of the things that are considered rude in an American context are things the Japanese would never dream of doing.  That doesn't mean that within a Japanese cultural context, which after all is the appropriate one to go by if you're in Japan, that Japanese people are not rude.  Japanese people can be fantastically rude, but they do it within the context of their cultural norms.  They can be particularly rude to non-Japanese, and Westerners in particular are simply oblivious in my experience, which generally constitutes an even more serious loss of face for the person being insulted.

In general, if a French person is behaving in a manner that you consider rude, there are two possibilities:

1. The most likely explanation is that their notion of what constitutes rude behavior is different from yours.  For example, Americans generally feel that being friendly is the same as being polite.  This is not wrong *per se*, it's just how American people view politeness norms and so really only valid if you're in the US.  Americans smile and try to be familiar and friendly.  French people hate this.  French has a T-V distinction and a large part of being polite is addressing people properly.  In general, using people's first names if you don't know them or not greeting them or not saying please and thank you are far bigger gaffs that not smiling or being curt.  Moral: don't judge what's polite based on your idea of what politeness is when you're traveling.  Politeness is a social thing, and varies from place to place (majorly -- check out the dirty looks you'll get from Russians if you even inadvertently show them the soles of your feet).

2. You've done something rude (see above for examples).  You probably didn't mean it, but the French person you're talking to likely doesn't know anymore about your culture's notion of politeness than you do his, and you're in *his* country.  So you behave accordingly.

I guess it's possible that he's actually being rude, but I didn't list that because in my experience 99% of the time that's not the case (just as 99% of the time, the American is not trying to be rude, nor the Japanese person, etc -- most people are decent, no matter where they're from.)","what is considered polite and rude is very cultural.","polite and rude","rude","but",FALSE,"polite and rude","polite",NA,NA,0,"reddit",0.40311,"thick_moral_concepts_NEG","negative",NA,NA,"thick_moral_concepts"
"To your very good answer I may add other factors such as  : being robbed as soon as they arrive, or not too late after, which usually does not make for the best start, and also the absolute NEED of Japanese people to eat Japanese (most notably rice, nori), which we don't do in France,  so they feel very quickly that they lack something vital. You see, when your country's history is to have been locked on itself for centuries, you're not really prepared to live abroad, and when you're in a place that doesn't accommodate you very well (EVERYTHING is different), it's easy to feel helpless and to panic.

I would also say that Paris is a capital, and a capital is usually not the best place to feel at ease (Tokyo is the same : people are cold and rude, but that's the ""capital syndrome"").

"^^^^AUTOMOD  ***This is a copy of the above post. It is a record of the post as originally written, in case the post is deleted or edited.***

There is a bit of a back story to this. So originally I placed an order a few months ago on Uber Eats, when the delivery guy got here I was brushing my teeth and didn’t immediately here the door bell. He might’ve waited a max of 5 minutes. When I got to the door he was not only rude but extremely threatening. He questioned me aggressively “What took you so long you know I’m waiting?” It was hostile and actually odd. Never been in a situation where I thought an employee was a danger or something. I then made the comment “Hey man, sorry I kept you waiting I’ll throw in a couple extra bucks” genuinely trying to be nice. He proceeds to make me uncomfortable. I can’t really describe the situation but it wasn’t just him being mad about waiting, he actually felt like a loose canon and he might hit me or something. He then leaves, but instead of tipping him I said screw that, left him nothing and went on about my life. 

A few months goes by and that brings me to today, I made an order on Uber Eats and what do you know he is my driver. The last time I saw him made me so uncomfortable I almost canceled it, but he was to close and decided not to. He gets to the door and I know he remembers me but a split second before I opened it I thought I’d be polite. I said “Thank you sir.” He sort of just shoves it in my hands and doesn’t say a word. 

I contacted Uber and asked them to blacklist him from coming to my house. Never asked for a refund or anything like. Just want to be able to order food without that turd coming here again. Oh well. 

So AITA

tl;dr Uber Eats driver was a dick, contacted support and pretty sure he doesn’t work there anymore

"Thank you! That's very kind. I have considered moving out of London for a variety of reasons, but I'd end up going somewhere north I think. Wouldn't leave the UK.

I first came to London as a wide-eyed 15-year-old craving a 'cooler' place to live than my little coastal town, and I fell in love with the fast pace, the cultural offerings, the architecture.. And these are things I genuinely and thoroughly still love about London, along with the people. I know many consider Londoners to be rude and awful but I've found people to be warm, interesting, welcoming, intelligent, funny. I like the melting pot aspect of this city as well. 

In contrast, Swedes are very cold, reserved and like to keep to themselves and their established friendship groups. Often, they've all grown up together and are suspicious of new people trying to enter the circle. I realised this when I moved back home for a few months during my third year at uni. I had a very hard time meeting people and reconnecting with old friends and acquaintances and their friends were... not outright rude but not very friendly, and not very interested in getting to know me whatsoever. Conversation was forced. I'm a very chatty person who loves asking questions (trained journalist and natural busybody), and I just wouldn't get anything in return. Now, if you speak English and you come from another country (especially US, Canada, Australia or UK), you'll get the royal treatment. People LOVE English speaking people because it's a novelty and exotic and they get to practice their English. You'd see a very different side of things, which is why a lot of people don't believe me when I tell them. Now, naturally, there are tons of really friendly Swedes who are awesome to get to know but they don't seem to be from where I'm from! I much prefer the English, but perhaps it's the same thing there - they're nice to me because I'm foreign and it's more interesting to talk to me than some bird who grew up in Clapham. I don't know.

As for the country itself, that's what I'm missing the most. WOODLANDS. I go to Hampstead Heath as often as I can for that reason. I also miss the sea a lot. I'm going back home soon for a weekend and can't wait to go into the woods and just be. London's way too hectic for me these days and WAY TOO MANY PEOPLE. 

As for whether or not people are happier - I don't know. People are obsessed with status. My mother told me a few years ago that they were having problems in my home town with teenagers selling sex so they could buy luxury items and keep the whole 'Instagram lifestyle' going, and I don't doubt it for a second. It all comes down to who you know obviously but my friends here seem pretty happy, and we don't have much.","i know many consider londoners to be rude and awful but i've found people to be warm, interesting, welcoming, intelligent, funny.","rude and awful","rude","but",FALSE,"rude and awful","awful",NA,NA,1,"reddit",-0.70536,"thick_moral_concepts_NEG","negative",NA,NA,"thick_moral_concepts"

"Here are the ones that stood out to me for Lebanese:

- No شو عامل (it seems to me to mean ""what have you done [before]"", not ""what are you doing"")
- No ممتاز (you can probably say جيّد instead, but take care not to overuse it — it's kind of funny because it's a super-formal, unused word for ""good"" on the one hand, but on the other hand it's a slangy/informal way of saying ""awesome"" or ""great"")
- You can also use مش فهمان instead of مش فاهم if you like (pronounced either fahmēn or fihmēn)
- I don't think most of us use ""2azonn"" أظنّ for ""I think/I suppose"". You can say بتصوَّر/بعتقِد (negated with ما) or قَوْلي (negated with مش, unless you're learning from people who use ما for everything). I'd be wary of trying to translate ""I guess"" directly with any of these though, hmph
- Probably the biggest one: for ""be quiet"", say سكوت skōt (long ō, not long ū!), not 2uskut... but if you must say it that way, then go with 2iskut instead of 2uskut. The other word is pretty rude, but same idea: خراس khrās is preferable to ""2ikhras"".
- &amp;lrm;ولا يُمكن wouldn't fly (especially not with that يُـ). Depending on the meaning of ""no way"" that you're going for, you can try something like لاء أبدا (second word being either 2abadan or 2abada) or مش معقول
- I hate to say it but ""sorry"" سوري is probably used more than آسف lmao. You can also go with عفوا ""excuse me/pardon""
- Our معلش is usually معلَيش ma3lēsh with a long ē (or even ma3laysh in areas up north), and you'll hear معلَيه ma3**lē** (stress on the second syllable) equally often.
- The use of مالك is one I have hard numbers for! In a survey of 98 Lebanese people, مالك was picked by 3. Admittedly, the question was for ""what's with you?/what's your problem?"" instead of ""what's wrong?"", but TBH those both translate to mostly the same expressions (and the actual meaning conveyed depends on context + tone of voice). Common alternatives on the aggressive ""what's your problem?"" end include شو إشبك؟ and شو قصّْتك؟, and a more-neutral option is anything similar to شو بيك (shu bēk, shu bīk, 2esh bāk, shibak, shubak, 2aysh bak...). If you really just want to ask ""what's wrong?"" with no chance of being misconstrued, then go for شو في؟, literally meaning ""what is there?"".
- Definitely do شو عم تسوّي/شو عم بتسوّي or شو عم تعْمل for ""what are you doing?"", not شو بتسوّي.
- For ""lying down"", use مسَطَّح (less-commonly متسطِّح)
- Certain Lebanese use ضجران for ""bored"" along with ضجِر for ""to get bored"" (instead of زهقان and زهِق)
- Use هيّاني instead of هيّني for ""here I am"". (FYI, the literal meaning of the chart's هيني جاي is ""here I am, coming"")
- For ""relaxation, leisure"", you can use رْياحة instead of راحة. I say ع رياحتك fire ""take your time"" (""at your leisure""), not براحتك
- Same as with ""shut up"" above: you want khōd rā7tak/ryē7tak خود راحتك/رياحتك with a long ō, not خُد.","the other word is pretty rude, but same idea: خراس khrās is preferable to ""2ikhras"". - &amp;lrm;ولا يُمكن wouldn't fly (especially not with that يُـ).","rude, but same","rude","but",TRUE,"pretty rude , but same","same","pretty",NA,1,"reddit",-0.00292,"thick_moral_concepts_NEG","negative",NA,0.63762,"thick_moral_concepts"

"I think the intended effect of segregation was to allow racist white people to stay away from black people, and separating cultures was most likely a secondary byproduct.

Stereotyping is to say ""you are black, so you must be louder in public than someone who is not black."" Stereotyping is not saying that black people tend to be more openly gregarious. An Asian stereotype is that they're all great at math. It is not a stereotype to say that Asians as a group do better at math.

You should not be laughed out of the thread for pointing out that white people are quieter on trains. It probably is non-controversial to say that white culture is more subdued in public. What's ridiculous is to then ascribe these differences in culture to individual differences. It's different to say ""white people are quieter in public because that is their social norm"" than to say ""white people are quiet because they're all so unfriendly."" Differences in culture should be OK to acknowledge and even choose to like or dislike. 

But my point is that racism occurs not when these differences are pointed out but when one is made inferior to another. There are a lot of people in this thread saying ""black people are loud and rude,"" but the loud judgment is very different from the rude judgment. ""Rude""ness is only relative to your own culture--essentially you'd be saying ""this person doesn't live by my cultural norms, so they are worse than me.""

"My dad built our family home from the ground up. He would get super pissed about stuff because the house was an extension of himself. He put blood, sweat, and tears into it. That house is his life's work. He's a woodworker and a stonemason. He said he felt our house should be a showplace. 

He never flipped out about us steaming up the shower or anything.  It was a lot more about keeping the house tidy. I never felt uncomfortable or weirded out about his behaviour though. It was more like, every once and awhile the frustration of cohabitation would rear up and present itself in that way. My mom was also passive.

My father in law got a new truck a few years ago. At the time they were living in a large apartment complex. He literally had to walk across the entire parking lot because he was paranoid someone would hit the truck or scratch it and refused to park near other vehicles. Because nothing takes the shine of off a new vehicle like that first scratch. 

Point is, people get attached to material things, especially material things they've worked hard for. However it's a fools errand because houses get lived in and trucks get driven.

To me it sounds like he's marking his territory and demanding respect over something he really values. But it's silly because it's a bathroom. Of course it should be kept clean and hygienic because people wash their dirty bodies and take craps in there. But it's not worth it to alienate your family over material things.

The only thing that ever changed my dad was that my sister moved out on her own after high school, soon after my parents divorced, and then I eventually moved out. So now when he looks around at a messy house ... it's his mess. 

Is there a way that you could let your dad be the only person that uses that bathroom? Is it the only bathroom? If he wants to control it that bad let him be the sole user. 

If he's alienating everyone it's irrational. If he's just being annoying it's rude but normal considering the bathroom is brand new. Doesn't make it right though! It's a space that will be used. He should have been cognisant of that from day one of the project.

"Have all the players make a will save. Pass a private note to everyone except the one with the lowest save (I'll refer to him as Bob), explaining what is about to happen.

From Bob's perspective, nothing now changes. He and the rest of the party are just standing in a seemingly normal room. However, the rest of the party starts to act differently towards him. It starts out as just mean-spirited and rude, but soon becomes outright hostile. Bob will eventually have to fight back against the players. Fudge their rolls so that Bob doesn't get hurt very much (attacks either miss often or don't do much damage), but make it so that Bob will eventually kill the entire rest of the party. This solves the puzzle.

Although Bob didn't sense it, when he failed his Will save, he actually fell to the ground and entered a dream state. The rest of the party is actually perfectly safe, but Bob can't discover this until he's killed the rest of the ""dream party"" and woken up from his stupor. 

If all goes well (and the other players are into it), Bob (the player) will start to feel paranoid and uncomfortable as all of this is happening, and will probably feel terrible about having to kill everyone else's characters, only to discover that none of it actually happened.

"The only reason I can think is they deal with so much shit one-to-one and all day.

I know what you mean regarding other customer service jobs... restaurants, even supermarkets... so here is my opinion.

Bus drivers (at least in Scotland) have to deal with:

Junkies/people smacked out their face in the day time. Being aggresive. Restaurant workers don't get that as much. Supermarkets may... but then there are several managers and workers to help de-escalate. As well as a direct link to the police. Bus drivers are alone.

Timed breaks. If your bus driver stops at a depot at 1.30 for lunch, and is back on at 2.00 on another bus... it is frustrating if they have to deal with people dilly dallying around, or being rude. If they get to the depot at 1.40, then they may still have to get on next bus at 2.00

Traffic laws. People treat buses like taxis. Stop here. Let me off here. Hurry up. (Again... i have heard it all). Bus drivers cant break the law or they risk losing licence and job.


Are they wrong to take it out on you? Yes. Absolutely. But look at other ""service"" jobs where people are rude (but not in a one-to-one scenario).

Local shopowners who stand on phone talking to suppliers when serving you.

"There’s nobody in the back. It’s just you and me at this point. I promise nobody else cares about your little meltdown; just me because you were rude. Not only rude, but wrong, and then you doubled down.

So: I want to know why, other than pure narcissism, you are avoiding these comments (I will also explain your mistakes to you once again, just for the sake of clarity):

1.
&gt;Yes, annoying marketing people in some parts of the world would like you to think that ""LED TV"" means LED-backlit LCD.

2.
&gt; semiconductor LED displays are still pretty uncommon in consumer applications

3.
&gt; Dark mode is often harder on your battery unless you're using an LED-based display


1. That is *exactly* what a TV marketed as an “LED TV” is.

2. Consumer LED displays are not “uncommon.” Consumer LED displays don’t exist (yet).

3. Naw, buddy. Dark mode is easier if the electroluminescent element in your display is an LED. The only consumer displays containing LEDs are LCDs backlit by those LEDs. In other words, by definition only “LED-based displays” are backlit by said LEDs. See again your comment:

&gt; Dark mode is often harder on your battery unless you're using an LED-based display

When a display is *backlit* by LEDs—in other words, a display with driven LEDs as an electroluminescent layer behind a tinted liquid crystal layer—we call that an LCD. This type of display *uses* LEDs, to be sure and it uses them in combination with a second driven element: an LCD. A **l**iquid **c**rystal **d**isplay.

The electroluminescent layer (you might call this a “lightbulb”) is an LED. It creates light. Like a [lightbulb](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ).

That light shines through a tinted liquid crystal transistor layer which causes that light to appear as one of three (sometimes four) colors.

In this design, “black” takes more energy than “white” (which is not really white, but I’m not going in to the different ways to create the perception of “white”) because we need the liquid crystal layer to turn [on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) to [obscure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) or [block](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) the backlight completely. When the backlight is blocked, you perceive no color, therefore “black”. (Or close to it). When a device is [on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) it generally consumes more energy than when that device is [off](https://www.pornhub.com].

I’ll put that *another* way in case you need an ELI2 instead of an ELI5: when the liquid crystal layer creates an image through reflectivity or tint, white is the *easiest* color to make because the liquid crystal layer is “off” and you can see the light behind it. That light is white. Easy things take less energy to do. Therefore displaying the color white uses less energy than any color that requires obstruction of the backlight.

OLEDs need no backlight. Each pixel is itself an electroluminescent element. Therefore we can organize many OLEDs in such a way that they create a cohesive, driven, display. Each OLED becomes a pixel coordinate in that larger display.

In order to create the appearance of “black” in a display comprised of many electroluminescent pixels, we can simply turn the pixel at a specific coordinate off. That makes the “easiest” color for a display of this design to produce black; a “black” pixel is an “off.” Things that are “easier” take less energy than things that are not easy (or [“hard”](http://www.pornhub.com) if you will). Therefore a display comprised of OLEDs will use significantly less energy when displaying black than when displaying any other color.

Note again that this is the opposite of the way an LED backlit display operates. Therefore your assertion that dark mode is harder when using an LED based display—and your rude comment that I should feel
&gt;sad about correcting someone that's already correct

is not only rude, but laughable, as you were quite incorrect.

"I think the intended effect of segregation was to allow racist white people to stay away from black people, and separating cultures was most likely a secondary byproduct.

Stereotyping is to say ""you are black, so you must be louder in public than someone who is not black."" Stereotyping is not saying that black people tend to be more openly gregarious. An Asian stereotype is that they're all great at math. It is not a stereotype to say that Asians as a group do better at math.

You should not be laughed out of the thread for pointing out that white people are quieter on trains. It probably is non-controversial to say that white culture is more subdued in public. What's ridiculous is to then ascribe these differences in culture to individual differences. It's different to say ""white people are quieter in public because that is their social norm"" than to say ""white people are quiet because they're all so unfriendly."" Differences in culture should be OK to acknowledge and even choose to like or dislike. 

But my point is that racism occurs not when these differences are pointed out but when one is made inferior to another. There are a lot of people in this thread saying ""black people are loud and rude,"" but the loud judgment is very different from the rude judgment. ""Rude""ness is only relative to your own culture--essentially you'd be saying ""this person doesn't live by my cultural norms, so they are worse than me."" That's where racism occurs--and therefore tolerance isn't in ignorance of race, but in paying attention to the differences.","there are a lot of people in this thread saying ""black people are loud and rude,"" but the loud judgment is very different from the rude judgment.","loud and rude","rude","but",FALSE,"loud and rude","loud",NA,NA,0,"reddit",-0.10682,"thick_moral_concepts_NEG","negative",NA,NA,"thick_moral_concepts"

""Bullshit.""

Minor, but hardly what I want to put up with.  Check how many times I said similar words about your views.

Here I am being very conciliatory and you simply use it as an opportunity to baselessly attack the soundness of my views in a way that I could equally easily turn around with equal base[lessness].  Only minorly rude, but useless in terms of discussion.

1.
&gt;Yes, annoying marketing people in some parts of the world would like you to think that ""LED TV"" means LED-backlit LCD.

2.
&gt; semiconductor LED displays are still pretty uncommon in consumer applications

3.
&gt; Dark mode is often harder on your battery unless you're using an LED-based display


1.
That is *exactly* what a TV marketed as an “LED TV” is.

2.
Consumer LED displays are not “uncommon.” Consumer LED displays don’t exist (yet).

3.
Naw, buddy. Dark mode is not easier if the electroluminescent element in your display is an LED. [Easy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) is the opposite of [hard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ). Unless is a conjunction, it means “except if” and is used to form a juxtaposition of two clauses.
Therefore what you wrote means “dark mode is harder, except if you are using a display based on LEDs, then the opposite is true: dark mode is easier when using a display based on LEDs”. You further specify what you mean by “opposite” thusly:

&gt;OLED and some other technologies are the exception

The exception to “dark mode is easier when using a display based on LEDs” is OLED? Dark mode is *[harder](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)* when using OLEDs? Not the case, my anvil-dwelling friend.

The only consumer displays containing LEDs are LCDs backlit by those LEDs. In other words, by definition only “LED-based displays” are backlit by said LEDs. See again your comment:

&gt; Dark mode is often harder on your battery unless you're using an LED-based display

When a display is *backlit* by LEDs—in other words, a display with driven LEDs as an electroluminescent layer behind a tinted liquid crystal layer—we call that an LCD. This type of display *uses* LEDs, to be sure and it uses them in combination with a second driven element: an LCD. A **l**iquid **c**rystal **d**isplay.

The electroluminescent layer (you might call this a “lightbulb”) is an LED. It creates light. Like a [lightbulb](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ).

That light shines through a tinted liquid crystal transistor layer which causes that light to appear as one of three (sometimes four) colors.

In this design, “black” takes more energy than “white” (which is not really white, but I’m not going in to the different ways to create the perception of “white”) because we need the liquid crystal layer to turn [on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) to [obscure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) or [block](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) the backlight completely. When the backlight is blocked, you perceive no color, therefore “black”. (Or close to it). When a device is [on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) it generally consumes more energy than when that device is [off](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ).

I’ll put that *another* way in case you need an ELI2 instead of an ELI5: when the liquid crystal layer creates an image through reflectivity or tint, white is the *easiest* color to make because the liquid crystal layer is “off” and you can see the light behind it. That light is white. Easy things take less energy to do. Therefore displaying the color white uses less energy than any color that requires obstruction of the backlight.

OLEDs need no backlight. Each pixel is itself an electroluminescent element. Therefore we can organize many OLEDs in such a way that they create a cohesive, driven, display. Each OLED becomes a pixel coordinate in that larger display.

In order to create the appearance of “black” in a display comprised of many electroluminescent pixels, we can simply turn the pixel at a specific coordinate off. That makes the “easiest” color for a display of this design to produce black; a “black” pixel is an “off.” Things that are “easier” take less energy than things that are not easy, or hard, if you will. Therefore a display comprised of OLEDs will use significantly less energy when displaying black than when displaying any other color.

Note again that this is the opposite of the way an LED backlit display operates. Therefore your assertion that dark mode is harder when using an LED based display—and your rude comment that I should feel

&gt;sad about correcting someone that's already correct

Sarcasm is rude and aggressive, but it's not a personal attack except possibly by implication. You could make an argument that I was trying to imply that cycle2 is stupid because he failed to notice that some people will decide to install Linux after making their purchasing decision. I wasn't trying to do that, just employ some sarcasm to make my comment funnier.

A personal attack is statement that there is something wrong with a person. ""You are stupid"" is almost certainly a personal attack, but ""You have an IQ of 70"" may not be, e.g. when a psychiatrist informs a patient of his test results.

*Ad hominem* is a logical fallacy involving a personal attack. Personal attacks aren't always an *ad hominem*; this is only the case when the attack is used in argument. Its basic form goes like so:

1. Alfred says this.
2. Alfred is stupid/a liar/an adulterer/something else unsavory.
3. Therefore, Alfred is wrong.

You can see this on Reddit when someone makes a comment like, ""Of course a *Java* programmer would prefer static typing."" I was rude, but I didn't make a personal attack on cycle2 so no *ad hominem* occurred. I could have made the following comment, which contains a personal attack, without employing *ad hominem*:

&gt; I know, anyone who buys a laptop and later wants to install Linux should buy another laptop.
&gt; 
&gt; You're stupid.

That's a pretty bad comment, and even if I thought cycle2 was stupid and wanted to tell the world, I probably would have phrased it differently.

Point out the yellow arrows &amp; marks on the map that indicate where a quest is located, found &amp; turned in. 

Or in specific, teach him to read. Have him sit on your lap while you &amp; him play together and help him learn to read using the game. It will be a great bonding exercise between you both and it will be great fun I'm sure. Praise him well when he masters/figures something out.

On the flip side, you could just let him poke at it on his own and come to you with questions. If EVERYTHING is pointed out to him, he wont build critical thinking/puzzle solving skills which are greatly needed for gaming. best of luck.

"It is a classic thing you notice when dealing with both Americans and Europeans.


Americans in Europe often describe Europeans to be a little bit cold and unfriendly, while Europeans traveling the US often complain about all the fake friendliness. Both views are true, because of our cultural differences. 


I'm from Central Europe, too, and people can be a bit closed off. But most interactions are much more honest, direct and genuine. What you see is what you get.  
Americans, on the other hand, often appear to be fake and spend so much effort on an apparently skin-deep joviality. But they often are just open, friendly and curious and use positive interactions as social lubricant. They often won't say negative things directly, rather choosing a more subtle approach to get the message across.  
At my company we have people from several European countries and also from the US - it takes new employees some time to adjust to people from ""across the pond"". Americans actually teach other Americans not to take things we say personally - that we are not rude, but just direct and mean well. On the flipside we teach Europeans (mostly Germans and Austrians) to read more between the lines when dealing with Americans and add more niceties.


European and North American countries often get thrown into this huge superculture called ""the West"". But while it appears to be all the same, there are many differences; even within Europe.

"Right here! I lived in Berlin for a year and just came back to the States about a week ago, as Charisma said. Honestly, though, the advice that has been given here is really everything I was going to say. The Germans aren't much for beating around the bush. They're not rude, but small talk just isn't something they engage in as often as we do. Your best bet is to go by the apartment, greet them in German and ask if they can speak English (this is just a courtesy thing, as most Germans do have a working knowledge of English), and then explain your situation. In my experience I never got the cold shoulder before being given at least a chance to explain myself; they would listen, and if the answer was ""no,"" that's what they'd say, and likewise for ""yes."" But if their plants are in a window, it's probably reasonable for them to expect to get a few questions from inquiring minds, so I'm sure it won't seem totally out of the blue.

I will say that the first time I saw really excellent bud in Germany was when I was studying with some friends at the beginning of the semester. When I asked where one of the guys had gotten it, he'd said from a friend. When I asked if he could hook me up with his friend so I could get some better stuff than I was getting in the parks at the time, he seemed a little uncomfortable and seemed to imply that his dealer only dealt to personal friends. You may have to exert a little extra effort to really befriend the person/people in the apartment, but if you're able to find weed elsewhere (like in the parks or something), even if it's kind of schwaggy, you may be able to use that as a pretense, something like ""I saw your plants and I have some weed of my own, I was wondering if you wanted to smoke sometime.""

tl;dr - Give it a shot. Start out in what German you know (introducing yourself, asking if they can speak English), and explain yourself thoroughly but politely, and you'll probably have good results, especially if they're younger (late teens to early 20s). I wish I could give you some more specialized advice, but really it's a similar situation to what you'll find everywhere else.

Good luck!

"I didn't ""come out"" as an atheist to my family until very recently, because I saw no point in discussing it; I felt it would only place myself in an unnecessarily stressful situation. 

I laugh at the jokes on r/atheism and facepalm at the delusional facebook statuses, but in ""real life"" I try to be a kind, nonjudgmental person. What you do or don't believe in is your own business, and so long as you keep it that way, I have no problem with it. I try not to be resentful of or consider myself intellectually superior to the religious community -- as difficult as it can be -- because I don't want to be an asshole. Most of us have been there, anyway. From experience, arguing from any type of righteous, high-horse point of view (on any side of the fence) tends to make the opposition hold on even more desperately to their position. I'm not confrontational about my lack of beliefs unless it's absolutely imperative.

HOWEVER, my sister is a very loudmouthed, outspoken critic of religion. While I agree with her position on just about every issue, she comes off as rude and demeaning, and she can be a real jerk about it. 

I only came out because she made it easier on me. Even then, I probably wouldn't have come out because I don't feel a compulsive need to talk about it, but my family was complaining about her atheism and bemoaning about where they could have gone wrong to ""raise an atheist"", so I came out mostly as a way of defending her and pointing out that yes, she may be rude, but she's not the irrational one. I had to explain to them that like Christians or Muslims or any other group, there can be bad and good apples. 

After I came out, my parents said some pretty generic, hurtful things (mostly regurgitated fear-mongering). But eventually my Mom came around a little bit, and I think she's relieved to find that atheists can be normal, moral people.

"Your char is definitely a huge tank. AC 17 with Aura of Antipathy is probably the single most broken thing thing you can do with multi class--I'm not sure WotC knew of that synergy during design.

I honestly wound never worry about going toe to toe with anything from the play test packet (barring über powerful things). A giant that has to roll a 12 or better and choose the worse of two will seldom hit.

That being said, you've sacrificed raw melee prowess due to the multiclass. Except for your daily dramatic spells, you're mostly a 1d8+3 per round kind of guy. Your 6th level wizard friend will be blowing stuff away with 6d6 fireball while you're still pumping 3d6 burning hands. Your 6th level fighter friend is attacking twice and reaping greater pathway benefits. Unfortunately, this often causes the DM to just ignore you in combat, as you're too hard to hit and you're not as much of a danger as everyone else. 

Keep burning hands, but I'd really focus on status effect spells: cause fear, sleep, etc. And you really don't need shield. That one time you get hit next play session you'll probably hate me, but if you've never seen AC 17 aura of antipathy before, you're in for a treat (so's your DM). Characters increase their offensive capabilities by being able to finish the battle quickly, which can be done by turning a person unconscious.

Now your offense is not bad per se, your spells will be good when they go off and you have action surge. From here on out, I recommend favoring one class and dabbling a bit in the other in order to increase offense. Consider 5/15 wizard or 8/12 wizard.

I'm pre-HRT mtf living with my unsupportive elderly parents. I'm currently doing my PhD but due to COVID19 and health problems from anxiety I'm working from home.

A couple of years ago I had tried to transition and make them understand that I had to do it but they became so bad shit crazy screaming that they would die if I did it and ""nobody would support me"" yada yada... and I backed down (which caused my health to go rapidly downhill).

Few days ago I was stupid enough to tell my mother - after her asking me persistently - where I was going to go - to have laser (6th session now). Since then she has been very worried and angry regarding me going out saying that she's afraid I will contact COVID19 and infect them too. And that she doesn't want to die that way.

  
She has set an ultimatum that if I go and have laser again I shouldn't come back and go find a place to rent. Keep in mind we live in a big house and I have tried to convince my father to empty the basement from old apparatus and things he has (unfortunately he's a hoarder) so I could go there while he could go upstairs but he has blatantly refused.

Strictly speaking they can't make me leave and I can't leave in the condition I am (have difficulty walking - adrenal issues, plus being on the verge of crying all day).

Past few months - weeks I've kept my mother on an information diet. A couple of days ago I finally told both of them that we are not going to discuss anything regarding my transition and that it's a personal matter. She got angry saying that as long as we live together she has to know what I'm doing, where I'm going. She also stressed that me saying I have personal issues is rude and that I didn't used to be like that.

So, what do you think? Also, advice on changing my behavior? I don't want to appear rude but firm.

Thanks!

"Two traveling monks reached a town where there was a young woman waiting to step out of her sedan chair. The rains had made deep puddles and she couldn't step across without spoiling her silken robes. She stood there, looking very cross and impatient. She was scolding her attendants. They had nowhere to place the packages they held for her, so they couldn't help her across the puddle.
The younger monk noticed the woman, said nothing, and walked by. The older monk quickly picked her up and put her on his back, transported her across the water, and put her down on the other side. She didn't thank the older monk, she just shoved him out of the way and departed.
As they continued on their way, the young monk was brooding and preoccupied. After several hours, unable to hold his silence, he spoke out. “That woman back there was very selfish and rude, but you picked her up on your back and carried her! Then she didn't even thank you!”
“I set the woman down hours ago,” the older monk replied. “Why are you still carrying her?”","“that woman back there was very selfish and rude, but you picked her up on your back and carried her!","selfish and rude","rude","but",FALSE,"very selfish and rude","selfish",NA,"very",0,"reddit",-0.45258,"thick_moral_concepts_NEG","negative",0.1983,NA,"thick_moral_concepts"
"Japanese people are not ""polite"" and French people are not ""rude"".  What is considered polite and rude is very cultural.  French people are actually, on the whole, remarkably concerned with protocol and politeness, and a big part of the reason that American and Japanese tourists get treated badly is because within the context of French culture their behavior *is* rude.

Americans think Japanese people are polite because most of the things that are considered rude in an American context are things the Japanese would never dream of doing.  That doesn't mean that within a Japanese cultural context, which after all is the appropriate one to go by if you're in Japan, that Japanese people are not rude.  Japanese people can be fantastically rude, but they do it within the context of their cultural norms.  They can be particularly rude to non-Japanese, and Westerners in particular are simply oblivious in my experience, which generally constitutes an even more serious loss of face for the person being insulted.

In general, if a French person is behaving in a manner that you consider rude, there are two possibilities:

1. The most likely explanation is that their notion of what constitutes rude behavior is different from yours.  For example, Americans generally feel that being friendly is the same as being polite.  This is not wrong *per se*, it's just how American people view politeness norms and so really only valid if you're in the US.  Americans smile and try to be familiar and friendly.  French people hate this.  French has a T-V distinction and a large part of being polite is addressing people properly.  In general, using people's first names if you don't know them or not greeting them or not saying please and thank you are far bigger gaffs that not smiling or being curt.  Moral: don't judge what's polite based on your idea of what politeness is when you're traveling.  Politeness is a social thing, and varies from place to place (majorly -- check out the dirty looks you'll get from Russians if you even inadvertently show them the soles of your feet).

2. You've done something rude (see above for examples).  You probably didn't mean it, but the French person you're talking to likely doesn't know anymore about your culture's notion of politeness than you do his, and you're in *his* country.  So you behave accordingly.

I guess it's possible that he's actually being rude, but I didn't list that because in my experience 99% of the time that's not the case (just as 99% of the time, the American is not trying to be rude, nor the Japanese person, etc -- most people are decent, no matter where they're from.)","what is considered polite and rude is very cultural.","polite and rude","rude","but",FALSE,"polite and rude","polite",NA,NA,0,"reddit",0.40311,"thick_moral_concepts_NEG","negative",NA,NA,"thick_moral_concepts"

"Just gonna leave this here. Thanks /u/AWookieeFromKashyyyk

&gt; First Year: He was right. Hermione was a stuck up bitch and what he said was mean and rude but at the end of the day she humiliated him and he reacted like an 11 year old. At the end of the year he sacrificed himself, frankly risking death, in order that Harry and Hermione can go on.

Second Year: He goes to fight Slytherins monster because his friend and sister were hurt.

Third Year: Hermione was a bitch and went behind their backs, didn't even think to mention that she went to speak to McGonnegal. She was also wrong about it being cursed as much as she was right. She also was heartless about Scabbers (idgaf that he was Wormtail, she was still heartless). End of the year Ron stands up to what he believes is a mass murderer ""if you want to kill Harry you'll have to kill me too"".

Fourth Year: Imagine you're Ron. You spend weeks dreaming that maybe you'll be picked for the tournament, yeah you're underage but maybe just maybe you'll get to shine for once publicly and do something none of your brothers got to do. But nah it's your famous bff. He reacts like a normal teenager. You know what though? End of the year there's not one doubt that Voldemorts back despite much less evidence.

Fifth Year: They were right not to write to him, one wrong word could have been a disaster for the Order. Harry was being a child, they were at war. He spends the entire year supporting Harry being a little bitch and then goes to fight Death Eaters at the ministry because his friend had a dream.

Sixth Year: He dates a girl because he thinks Hermione doens't like him. I don't get the big deal here? End of the year faces Death Eaters, again.

Seventh Year: So Harry has no family and Hermione hides hers in Australia with no one noticing cause their muggles, grand. Ron on the other hand by the time he leaves for the hunt has one earless brother and another mauled by a werewolf. He doesn't have to go, Hermione and Harry can't go back to Hogwarts cause mudblood and chosen one. Ron can. Ginny does, Neville does, Luna does. Ron goes on the hunt anyway, putting himself and his family at risk. He's also human and worries about them, then they get a Horcrux, great. By this point his sister has been in a Death Eater ran school for 3 months and 2 of his brothers are being hunted for taking a stand and his whole family is under surveillance, especially worrying as they are involved in a long term lie about him being sick. If they are caught they will be tortured into insanity and killed. He still goes because he knows it is the right thing to do. He also goes without a clear idea of what is going to happen but he goes because he knows his friend has a plan, except he has no fucking clue. Then the Horcrux plays on all of this and he snaps and in a moment of weakness, after hearing his sister was punished at the school she is trapped in ran by Death Eaters and no one but him even pauses to think about it, Harry tells him to go and he does. He immediately regrets it and tried to go back but Harry and Hermione have already left, it's not his fault they didn't wait and he couldn't find them. He eventually comes back, saves Harry's life and destroys a Horcrux, overcoming his insecurities and completing the growth of the most compelling character arcs in the books. He then goes on to help destroy 2/3 remaining horcruxes, fights in the Battle of Hogwarts and is one of only three people to directly stare down Voldemort and defy him (""He beat you"") and continues to fight for what is right, even knowing Harry is dead and being one of only two people who knew the prophecy he actually thought the fight was futile at that point but he kept going because it was the right thing to do.

"Well, firstly, I'm going to say that your comments can definitely been seen as racist, or at the very least, very rude. To say ""Why are the Chinese so rude and disgusting"" is definitely not a good way to ask your question, even if you excused genuine hate. Secondly, I'm hoping that someone else can answer your questions better than myself, as, despite living in China for a year, I still feel naive to a lot of Chinese culture.

It's a really different culture. You can't ask why they don't understand common decency because you're thinking about it from what you and your culture considers polite! Chinese culture has very different considerations. When I first arrived in China I was very angry that I would be shoved out of the way to get on a bus. I mean, I'm British, where were the queues!? Then I realised, after missing a few buses, there are so many people that you have to be a little forceful or you'll miss out. Imagine being raised in a family of 15 and cookies only come in packs of 12. Tiny Tim better bring his A Game if he wants some chocolate chip. Despite the pushing, there's still a lot of care. Elderly folk and those with children we're respected and given seats or made room for.  

With regards to spitting. I can't answer much more than, it's considered healthy. I spent a night in a temple and, the next morning, the halls were echoing with the sound of phlegm being coughed up. I learned that it's to remove the badness from ones body. Who am I to argue? Of course, I may feel that it's rude but that's why it's a different, wonderful culture. Shit, if the world said ""Sorry!"" As much as British people, we wouldn't get anywhere. My American wife still laughs when I say ""Sorry, please could I have some water?""

I made lots of cultural mistakes while I was there. I was too forward nod caused a lot of people to lose face. ""DeZoet, would you like to come for dinner?"" I would be asked and sometimes I would reply ""No, thanks."" To not make an excuse and to be so direct, especially in front of others, caused loss of face. In other places I was too polite, and some friends told me this could be seen as offensive as it creates a wall between you and the other person, one that deters true familiarity.

I can't give you an in-depth, Reddit gold worthy explanation reaching back through Chinese history. But I can recommend you go there. See the people, try and witness the culture first hand. It's different, it really is. It will challenge your conceptions of rude and polite and would hopefully make you realise that your standard of living and what is socially acceptable doesn't hold up universally.","to say ""why are the chinese so rude and disgusting"" is definitely not a good way to ask your question, even if you excused genuine hate.","rude and disgusting","rude","but",FALSE,"so rude and disgusting","disgusting","so",NA,1,"reddit",-0.66804,"thick_moral_concepts_NEG","negative",NA,NA,"thick_moral_concepts"

"&gt;Who gives that advice? 

I have, but that's coupled with the advice to be courteous, read body language and back off if she/he isn't receptive to it. When someone is working, it could be rude to hit on someone in front of other customers or co-workers. But I don't think it would be rude to discretely pass your phone number or email and offer a coffee date, forever leaving you alone if you choose to not contact them. Anyhow, whether it's rude or not has a lot to do with the recipient. I'm very open, outspoken and assertive. I'm not offended when I'm hit on. I'm flattered.


&gt;I personally do not being hit on ever.

You're entitled to be how you are, but wow! You never want to be hit on? Please don't put people in the rude catagory for wanting to get to know you better. (Some people actually are rude, but most people I'd guess are just being friendly.) And some of these experiences might not be ""hitting on you,"" but flirty friendliness instead. If you're that awkward, you may not know the difference. If you want a better time of dealing with the outside world, change your attitude about it and find ways to respond so you don't feel so awkward. (Because they're not going to change for you.)

Try some new things. If someone tells you that you're pretty, look them in the eyes and confidently say, ""Thank you."" If someone asks you for your number or for a date, look them in the eyes, be happy and confident and say, ""That's flattering, but I'm not dating. I'm way too busy. Thanks, though."" You'll get better at it. Be friendly. Thank people for compliments. When a man compliments you, odds are he's not trying to offend. He might not even be hitting on you. This is just how a good portion of society interacts. 

I'm not trying to be rough on you. I just really think you should change your attitude and develop skills to deal with this and maybe even turn it into something positive where you enjoy the interactions. 

I had an old man hit on me not long ago. He was actually being rude and sleazy about it, but I'm not one to be offended. I was laughing and told him, ""I have a vintage car, but I'm not in the market for a vintage man. Nice try, viagra."" I laughed. He laughed. I high fived him. All was good. That was the end of it. I could have been upset and creeped out, but why? I'd rather dish it back.

"I wouldn't recommend it.

Setting up an IDE (Eclipse is easier, Intellij IDEA is more intuitive and arguably more powerful but v14 is a bit.. temperamental with ForgeGradle at the moment) and working through some tutorials will be of more benefit to both of you I think.

As for progression I would go; create a new item, then create a new block, then do something clever with the block (play around with redstone, blocklight, metadata, change the icons around based on criteria) then maybe make an ItemBlock to allow you to combine what you've learned. Then move on to a TileEntity - try to make an equivalent to one of the minecraft ones, a chest or a furnace or something - this will introduce you to GUIs and sync issues which are ""tons"" of fun and an interesting challenge to complete efficiently.

Once you've done that, try extending it, make it automatable with ISidedInventory or make it do something wacky with the items inside it.

As for tutorials and resources, I have heard very good things about VSWEs Summer Courses which take you from the very basics of Java to some of the intricacies of modding. It's in 1.6.4 but from a CS point of view that's probably a good thing as it will prevent you from just blindly following exactly what he says and for you to think a bit ;)

Beyond that, if you need help the best place to get help is in IRC; #minecraftforge varies between very helpful and very rude, but is generally quite busy, some of the smaller channels are much more friendly and you might be more likely to get help with basic pointers.

I'm neither judging nor throwing derogatory terms. My only argument was, and will continue to be, that calling a promiscuous person a slut is insulting and rude, but not ""incorrect"" nor unfounded. 

Sexual promiscuity doesn't make someone ""beneath me"", in fact, I'm envious of all the action I'm missing out on.

I'm pre-HRT mtf living with my unsupportive elderly parents. I'm currently doing my PhD but due to COVID19 and health problems from anxiety I'm working from home.

A couple of years ago I had tried to transition and make them understand that I had to do it but they became so bad shit crazy screaming that they would die if I did it and ""nobody would support me"" yada yada... and I backed down (which caused my health to go rapidly downhill).

Few days ago I was stupid enough to tell my mother - after her asking me persistently - where I was going to go - to have laser (6th session now). Since then she has been very worried and angry regarding me going out saying that she's afraid I will contact COVID19 and infect them too. And that she doesn't want to die that way.

  
She has set an ultimatum that if I go and have laser again I shouldn't come back and go find a place to rent. Keep in mind we live in a big house and I have tried to convince my father to empty the basement from old apparatus and things he has (unfortunately he's a hoarder) so I could go there while he could go upstairs but he has blatantly refused.

Strictly speaking they can't make me leave and I can't leave in the condition I am (have difficulty walking - adrenal issues, plus being on the verge of crying all day).

Past few months - weeks I've kept my mother on an information diet. A couple of days ago I finally told both of them that we are not going to discuss anything regarding my transition and that it's a personal matter. She got angry saying that as long as we live together she has to know what I'm doing, where I'm going. She also stressed that me saying I have personal issues is rude and that I didn't used to be like that.

So, what do you think? Also, advice on changing my behavior? I don't want to appear rude but firm.

Thanks!

"I open my phone and start playing angry birds

I aggressively shout about any missed shots taking the game as seriously as my home team being in the super bowl even in the middle of a crowded restaurant

If she makes any comment on this I immediately begin acting as though I’m receiving a phone call. Angry birds is still visibly and audibly on the screen but I begin talking to my phone as though my other girlfriend is on the line. I am misogynistic and quite rude but also make it clear that I am on another date with a “real Uggo” but that I’m doing it to make my “real girlfriend” jealous.

"NTA. First comment, I was let know would be removed, so I deleted it, because in fairness, I really wasn't following the rules (specifically Be Civil). 

But, in an attempt to be civil: 

You shouldn't be made to feel bad about a personal life choice (be it one you made for work) and it is rather undecorous of the aunt to mention the body hair/choice/real woman thing in the first place, especially on what is essentially a public forum.

I've seen some comments calling to play OPs career and futuee and I'm surprised that those are seen as civil or in fact, relevant. OP's career is not the key point here, and honestly how this seems to be a sticking point is quite... incredible for the 21st century. 

I don't care how people get their money, so long as people aren't getting hurt. If OP is happy and safe at work, then jolly good. 

P.S. I CACKLED. I wish I could have seen the reactions. I know people say what OP did was unrealistic, but these things have a way of coming out and often in ways we don't like. So at least this was OP being honest and taking a stand for her views.

"He was always very impulsive and rude but never in a sexual way. Sexist definitely though. He used to wave the bible around yelling about how women should serve men barefoot and pregnant, blah blah blah... And a lot of racial rants or complaining about politics. But I was always used to him yelling and being an ass in general. What I wasn't used to was him being calm. Since he was diagnosed and put on meds he rarely talks anymore and when he does it's very mellow, almost completely lacking any emotion. I hadn't seen him barely at all since he started meds until a few months ago. Could explain why suddenly his voice took me back to that memory. Whoever I was talking to on the phone was pretty nice and cheery up until the tone changed to a dark one.

"I wouldn't recommend it.

Setting up an IDE (Eclipse is easier, Intellij IDEA is more intuitive and arguably more powerful but v14 is a bit.. temperamental with ForgeGradle at the moment) and working through some tutorials will be of more benefit to both of you I think.

As for progression I would go; create a new item, then create a new block, then do something clever with the block (play around with redstone, blocklight, metadata, change the icons around based on criteria) then maybe make an ItemBlock to allow you to combine what you've learned. Then move on to a TileEntity - try to make an equivalent to one of the minecraft ones, a chest or a furnace or something - this will introduce you to GUIs and sync issues which are ""tons"" of fun and an interesting challenge to complete efficiently.

Once you've done that, try extending it, make it automatable with ISidedInventory or make it do something wacky with the items inside it.

As for tutorials and resources, I have heard very good things about VSWEs Summer Courses which take you from the very basics of Java to some of the intricacies of modding.

"The only reason I can think is they deal with so much shit one-to-one and all day.

I know what you mean regarding other customer service jobs... restaurants, even supermarkets... so here is my opinion.

Bus drivers (at least in Scotland) have to deal with:

Junkies/people smacked out their face in the day time. Being aggresive. Restaurant workers don't get that as much. Supermarkets may... but then there are several managers and workers to help de-escalate. As well as a direct link to the police. Bus drivers are alone.

Timed breaks. If your bus driver stops at a depot at 1.30 for lunch, and is back on at 2.00 on another bus... it is frustrating if they have to deal with people dilly dallying around, or being rude. If they get to the depot at 1.40, then they may still have to get on next bus at 2.00

Traffic laws. People treat buses like taxis. Stop here. Let me off here. Hurry up. (Again... i have heard it all). Bus drivers cant break the law or they risk losing licence and job.


Are they wrong to take it out on you? Yes. Absolutely. But look at other ""service"" jobs where people are rude (but not in a one-to-one scenario).

Local shopowners who stand on phone talking to suppliers when serving you.

GP receptionists, who also deal with rude people and junkies, are obnoxious and rude themselves to others.

Maybe I should clarify what I said with some context.  I meant to say that harshly calling someone a slut, as using it as a derogatory, demeaning term.  I'm not referring to those who use it jokingly or as some kind of term of endearment.

&gt;I'm neither judging nor throwing derogatory terms. My only argument was, and will continue to be, that calling a promiscuous person a slut is insulting and rude, but not ""incorrect"" nor unfounded.

That's exactly my point.  It is insulting and rude because it insinuates that the person is beneath you.  For the most part, calling someone a slut is making a moral judgment.
