"My biggest, and it's afucking huge, pet peeve with Dota2 is one thing alone: The fact that every single entity seems to exist in it's own dimension. My biggest example, from what I've seen is Beastmaster's attack animation. It basically seems like it doesn't connect. At all. It seems like a weapon is swung, and not a single fuck is given. No impact, no feeling of impact, ripples, blood gushing or anything. It makes the game feel strange and kinda boring in a strange way I just can't let go of. That's a big one for me.

Otherwise, I'm personally a fan of the more ""realistic"" approach on graphics, so I'm favored towards HoN because of that. Dota2 choosing the cel-shaded artstyle seems to me like a way to save money when betting in an uncertain market (e.g. using the simplistic designstyle taken from TF2), and it looks childish to me. So graphicswise AND aestheticswise I lean to HoN. LoL falls in last on both accounts, because I read comics for comics, and play games for games. Not games for comics.

Maybe the graphics are more detailed and clean in dota2, but better; im not so sure... I'd say HoNs engine is more economical than it should be, I think it can pack a lot more punch, but is held back by the programmers.

I won't say anything on voiceacting, since I haven't seen enough of DOTA2 yet.  I enjoy HoNs stuff, it's all good except the comical bits (Drunken Brawler skin, seriously? It's funny, but stupid), but DOTA2 has some nice voiceacting on the heroes I've seen, and BMs shout sounds nice. They talk all the time after killing stuff though, which annoys me.. :p

Soundwise: Don't tell me that the sound of Maliken's sword stabbing the face of poor souls, or Magebanes gracing swings sounds like crap, because you must be drunk!","it's funny, but stupid), but dota2 has some nice voiceacting on the heroes i've seen, and bms shout sounds nice.","funny, but stupid","funny","but",TRUE,"funny , but stupid","stupid",NA,NA,1,"reddit",-0.50517,"thick_non-moral_concepts_POS","positive",NA,NA,"thick_non-moral_concepts"
"In that context it aren't just ""jokes"".
Joking about stuff like that is not only not funny, but also stupid and dangerous. Especially when considering the audience PDP has. Making casually racist jokes or comments can have a negative impact on people. Casual racism can fuel prejudice and discrimination.
People will start to think stuff like that is OK. Will start doing those ""jokes"" themselves in real life. In the end impacting the people's lives that are on the other side of these ""jokes"" or clichés etc

First of all: it is not just a word.
And why even use that word? So many words out there, but that is his go to word?
And of course he apologized. Because he had to. And then it was one of those many ""sorry I got caught and offended someone"" kind of apologies.
It tells you something when this is a person's go-to word that he probably used countless times before already.

There was more than that ""accidentally shout out"".

Good candidates are items already marked as TODO (funny but true) and increase reuse.  
Getting feedback and aiming for a goal (e.g., not just refactoring but refactoring aimed to reduce coupling) increase the probability of beneficial refactoring.

After you do some such refactoring, measure them. Once you can show that you provided a benefit (e.g., a reduction in the number of bugs in the refactored file), you will be trusted more and get more opportunities to refactor.

"well if he's confident he won't have a problem making decisions. Confidence and leadership naturally go hand in hand. You can't be strong and independent and want a man to lead at the same time.

But for him to be confident at specific times, there will have to be a power imbalance. That doesn't mean he can't take you seriously.

Idk if you've observed but women have a hard time deciding what they want in a relationship. 

Idk, in mine, and basically any guy's experiences there's always the usual ""babe you hungry"" ""no"" ""ok cool"" *makes food* ""babe wanna share"" guy: ""I thought you weren't hungry.""

Or the ""where do you want to eat tonight""  ""your call"" ""ok let's go here"" ""no I don't like that place"" guy: ""wtf""

Riv is even more funny than Phreak, his timing is just perfect, and he say the best one liners. And Riv also gives lots of room for his co-caster to come in and explain all sorts of things.

Brian and Veronica seem to be getting more comfortable (not in THAT way) talking to each other. Thus, the conversations are coming across more natural and more fluid with each episode. Keep that aspect going. It's hard to tell which of either of their dialogue to each other is in the script or actual adlibbed stuff. I guess when people can't tell the difference then that means you're doing a damn good job guys.


* Console love

Initially I loved the attention to consoles. Even better, a guest within IGN to sort of give you guys directly his scoops and predictions. However, overall, it felt like more of a Q&amp;A on consoles. I was hoping for more of a discussion. Brian chimed in shortly on how ""it's unfair to compare pc power to console power"". That was it though. The rest of it was a Q&amp;A. I was hoping for more discussion, more thoughts on consoles. What are your stances on the subject of next-gen consoles? Brian seemed into it but Veronica...I don't know when she made the whole comment, ""Aw that's my OLD pc. Hm."" when Daemon was talking about the ""superxbox's"" new graphics card being based on the Radeon HD 6670. That comment just seemed unbecoming of her. I took it as if she was saying ""ewww old graphics card I used on my old pc. Blah, consoles."" Since I know Veronica has had a lot of experience and interest in consoles and seeing her awesome work on Qore, I was a bit taken aback by that. Maybe I took it the wrong way and if I did I'll apologize and shutup. In no way am I trying to maliciously attack her or anything (trust me I like Veronica just as much as everyone else and initially began watching this show for her), I'm just giving honest feedback. I'm just hoping for more of a discussion where the hosts are enthusiastically/actively discussing, chiming in, making points and predictions about anything regarding consoles. My other disappointment here which isn't a big deal is lack of discussion on the PS4. I know there's not that much info on the ps4 out there yet, but there are rumors such as it having 30X more polygons from Naughty Dog's recent job listing and the fact that half of ND worked on The Last Of Us and deducing the other half working on Uncharted 4. All rumors I'm sure the senior editor would have known and could've shortly discussed and given his thoughts on.

P.S. C'mon Brian....what's your beef with blu-ray? :)

* PSA's

The funniest skits this week go to those PSA's. They were both equally funny but I think seeing Veronica's super sad face, pouty lip and her play with a random ball of yarn was a bit funnier. Mostly because of Brian laughing about her playing with yarn after her PSA was over...but....I don't know Brian's ""beard"" and egg-eating....as I said equally funny! Oh and I liked OMGchad being put into some of the skits too! He did a good job. I'm hoping for more of the funny you delivered in these ""PSA's"".

* The Score 

Interesting. Loved the ""DIC-tator"" comment. From a person that's never played Tropico before, it was very informative, Veronica showed that she played it thoroughly and she really liked it. I like when Brian and Veronica go off-topic in the conversation sometimes like they did here. Was Brian supposed to talk about a game as well? I was hoping that each week you both showcase 2 games you've been playing you really like and want to show to everyone. I'm thinking short games that are downloadable titles either from PSN or XBLA. A great game idea to showcase in a couple of weeks on The Score is ""Shank 2"". It comes out Feb 7th and I'm super stoked for it!

* This weeks ""Leet Sheet"" was fun! See this is what I'm talking about when top ""whatever"" lists can be fun.


* Interview

AWESOME. She spoke to freaking ASURA! So excited about that game and I had NO IDEA he was Asura. Off-topic please showcase Asura's Wrath in the future! Back on topic; Veronica asks such great questions I would have never thought of asking this guy. I have an interest in the VA field, especially in anime, so it was very informative for me. Great job as usual Veronica! I'm still hoping for some kind of backdrop during interviews to cover up the equipment off camera but keeping it dark and adding the purple accent light worked for me. I really liked Brian chiming in with a question. I know this is primarily Veronica's job to interview and she does an AWESOME job, but I feel Brian asking a real good relevant question(s) from time to time should be encouraged. Should've have got Liam to do more Asura yells!

* Appdiction

It was great. Loved the game showcased there. Alas, I don't have an Ipad....but in regards to how it was presented. I loved it. I didn't get the reference at first since it wasn't mentioned until afterwards. To me appdiction managed to be informative and funny at the same time. I couldn't help but love the info on the game but at the same time I was lmao at Veronica's ""whiskey binge drinking and cigar smoking"". Good work there.

I'm glad you're taking on-air feedback and having OMGchad lead with that. It's a great idea ending the show with audience feedback. I hope it becomes a staple in the show's lineup. Same goes for ultimately ending with either a funny, weird or quirky video. Now, I watched the YT upload since I missed 20 min of the first part of the show. I sort of like the funny comments, the giggles Brian and Veronica have when they watch these. I like seeing their reactions. It makes a video funnier, more interesting or even stranger. In the YT upload I didn't hear them as much. I would like to hear more of a ""mystery science theater 3000"" approach by the two to these weird and funny videos. Also, this is the first time I heard the ending theme song for the show and I like it a lot.

* My suggestions

Not really much I haven't already said. Continue the fluid conversations. I may sound like a nag but even more console love. Perhaps showcase some console only games that are coming out soon. If needed, myself and the rest of the audience can give you lists of top upcoming games.

* My questions

What is the possibility of having Game On! at PAX East in 2 months? Or maybe some kind of off-air event? I'm thinking slim, but it's a big gaming event and always sells out every year. I think it would be a great idea to get the show out there to new viewers. I know it's kind of far in Boston but I would love to participate as a studio audience or be one of those ""Hear ye, Hear YE. All needeth watch Game On!"" type people at PAX. I'll even bring a lantern and swing it around and such. Well, that is, if you guys could ever do something like that.

Well guys, this train is on the rails now, all it needs is a continued push to make it better each week. Which is what you all of you guys are so splendidly doing. Keep it up.

P.S.

"I find some older Twisting to be sillier, and he did more crank calls. He's had on a lot more serious guests layely, which is still cool, but yeah. It also may depend on who you like.


TJ Miller has a hilarious pod with Cash Levy, a man I had no idea even existed until I listened, and he's become one of my faves. The format is silly, with lots of riffing and kind of improvised bits in the way Bone Zone does it. This is also the pod with like the longest running in jokes and things like that. You will get more out of later episodes by being familiar with older ones, but they aren't required listening to enjoy it.


Pete Holmes podcast You Made it Weird is great too, but it's conversational more, but still very silly. I recommend Josh Ruben episode as a starter to this one. Though other episodes will be a lot more serious, but still 'silly'.


Houndtall by Moshe Kasher is a great new one where he has a panal of one expert, and 2 comedians and they discuss a subject in a live theater. Really fun one. Informational, but silly.


Bertcast with Bert Kreischer is another good one, often times VERY funny, always interesting. He's just a hilarious guy so any conversation he has is tinged with hilarity. 


Duncan Trussells podcast is fantastic, but might not be your style. It's often very funny, but he also often has serious guests. This is the guy that recorded a podcast with his mother hours before her death. Powerful stuff, has made me cry on multiple occasions. But still just so damn funny.


Here We Are by shame mauss is great, but more interesting subjects than just random conversations, but still very funny. Check out some descriptions of the episodes.


Ten Minute Podcast is always funny, and short and sweet. Never too much, given that you enjoy the hosts. 


Harmontown is also a great one, a weekly live podcast hosted by Dan Harmon, the creator of community and co creator of Rick and morty. He is always accompanied by a group of great hilarious people, and they usually play a bit of Shadow Run at the end of the episode, which is like d&amp;d but in the future, or something(it used to be d&amp;d, but they switched it up). It's nerdy, but always hilarious. The way the people deal with the situations in the game are extremely amusing. Dan also once had all the black people at the show come up on stage and play as one single character. It's beyond absurd sometimes.


That's Deep Bro is a great one, the tagline is something like, ""serious conversations with silly people"". Hosted by the very funny and insightful Christina patsizky, who is married to Tom Segura. Another kind of philosophically based one, but woven in with funny moments.


As for non comedy associated ones, 99% invisible is a great, very informative show, I recommend looking thru the ep listing and finding something that interests you as a good starter. Same with Memory Palace, very similar format and set up. Thinking Sideways is a good one where they explore unsolved, or unexplained mysteries and the like. Recent episodes were about the Mills Family, the Tylonal murders, and an episode about the wife of the current president of scientology, who has been missing or something for a few years I believe.

"That was an interesting and funny, but also a bit depressing read. Just the way I always feel after going to a lecture/presentation from a non-denominational church or even a prayer group.

I've got one funny story for you: A friend of mine, an atheist, went to a prayer group once, and he took another friend with him, who was a Roman Catholic. The people there welcomed them and asked them if they believed in God. My friend said, no, he didn't, but they were eager to assure him that was totally okay, and that maybe he'd enjoy the prayer group and find the way to Jesus yadayada. Then they turned to his friend, who told them he was Catholic. They looked a bit embarrassed, there was an awkward moment of silence, before they started with their songs or reading the bible or whatever.

So essentially they still had hope for the atheist, but the Catholic… Well, there wasn't much they could do for him, his soul was lost, he would go to hell. :-D

When they told me the story afterwards they found it hilarious, but they felt very weirded out about what came afterwards, which was similar to what you described, except that it took place in one of the guys' living room and not a church: Singing songs, shouting “Oh Jeeeesus”, getting real ecstatic, throwing their hands in the air.

I'm nto saying you behave like this, just explaing to you a a concept.

Another attitude is, home from work, say something funny (but sexy) like ""mmm dear you look edible"". Playful bite on the neck, keep discussion light and sexy and funny.

This will change how you two talk, and soon change what you talk about.

Not only that itl be fun both for you and her. It will Definitely not happen in a few days, weeks maybe even months but people do and can change.

"One winter day I thought it would be kinda funny to prank our volunteer assistant swim coach by looking like I was going to launch off the diving board with his only dry shirt.  He didn't think the prank was going to turn out so well, so he picked up the long squeegee and swung for the shirt.  I guess he thought he could snag it away from me and save it from getting soaked.  (Really, it was supposed to be scary and funny but I'd never actually do any harm to someone's stuff like that.)

Of course, I was 10-12 feet away and bouncing on the board, so instead of hooking the shirt the rubber and metal squeegee blade sliced across my knee just above the kneecap - hurt like hell, blood everywhere...  My reflexes kicked in and my hand slammed down on the cut, so instead of getting the shirt wet I got it bloody.

"I'm one of those odd introverts who is loud and funny but I get exhausted really quickly because o draw my energy from being alone: I.e. I'll go to a party and be the life of it and then need a week to recover. So when I lived at home I spent a lot of time in my room studying or gaming. My mum was always very understanding (my brother is the same) and I was always happy for her to come and talk to me and I always had dinner with them when I wasn't feeling too ill. 

One day my Yiayia comes to visit and she exhausts me like no one else ever could. I've actually secretly gone LC with her. I spend about 15 mins sitting there while she bitches to my mum about her own daughters (standard conversation). As I wasn't feeling very chatty, I went off to my room (keep in mind I'm 20 at this point, I'm an adult). I pull out my notes and do some study when I hear a kerfuffle outside my door. My Yiayia comes BURSTING in saying ""Why do you hate your FAAAAMILY?!"" with my very exasperated looking mum behind her. 

She starts ranting that I can't be in my room all the time (I'm not, I went to uni full time and had a job as well as a social/sex life) and that I hardly talk and how does my mother stand it??? 

My mum coldly replies, ""Well, I've always loved her just the way she is. Some of us do that with our kids you know. She's a healthy, productive young woman who loves her siblings, contributes in the home and never says a disrespectful thing to her parents. More than *some* people can say.""

My SO does seem like you in that regard (that she loves to talk and learn about me and getd upset when we do too little of this) and i personally think it may also be a difference in men and women in general. 

That last point is because i red that men, mostly bond when doing things together and once i taught about that that it explains perfectly how i got my (best) friends.
Women however bond by learning about eachother. Now ofc the book i red that in doesn't say this is true for all men and women.. Just a general ""huh that's funny but seeminly true in many cases"".

We do have things to talk about but i'm trying to give her the amount of attention she craves a bit more. 
Like sending her ""goodmorning, what are you doing, i love you's"" during the day.. But then she gives me a low-energy response back like ""i do too"" which kindoff indicates to me that she doesn't want that kindoff attention so much?

It certainly does not motivate me to give more attention.

Maybe you're right that it isn't the amount of attention which is the problem here but the quality (which is kindoff being impeded because of the lockdown..

"She may have been in the date zone but has now moved to the fun zone. Please watch the wife zone chart find a girlfriend on YouTube video. It's funny but true and I'm 40m so I've lived a lot of this.

Now your problems. Covid I feel is a cleaner of masked bad relationships. Some can be repaired while most will seperate. People are learning a lot about themselves, their others and the relationship when there aren't all these other distractions available to mask it. 

You said she doesn't talk about things and you get blindsided..get use to that. I've been with my wife 10 years now she holds things in, builds resentment then implodes I'm to blame for all of it. Most is her not talking, not wanting to start a fight. Then we finally talk I realize things I am actually to blame for and things she is doing that she has created blame on me that is actually her once I lay down unjudging evidence. So notice the signs early and promote communication or they will self detonate with their own crazy.

She's messy. Woman are not as together, clean, homemakers as society makes them out to be especially when they are younger. My wife's apartment looked like fucking horders when I met her, our first apartment the same most of the time, now we are older own a home that behavior has changed. Once again get use to it and unjudgingly communicate you find this unacceptable. ""Hey can WE keep the place cleaner because WE have to always be cleaning up a bunch of mess that becomes exhausting"" but you better have your cleanliness spot on cause if your contributing to this she's gonna throw that right at you. Cause woman have an issue admitting to faults in a relationship. You leave dishes laying around, clothes laying around etc etc even if it contributes only 10% to the problem your gonna get beat with the crazy stick.

This is not being sexist my wife is a true feminist, I love and respect but her but this shit is real we've talked extensively about these things and she laughs at how it's true.

Your young, this may have been an adulting relationship for you to practice, learn and let go so when you find the better one the, wife zone one you don't fuck it up. 

Central themes I see. Distance, friends, having fun, finding yourselves, improving your future selves, keeping you around but distant. Aka the fun zone. Accept that it's more of a friend's with benefits relationship or move on. She enjoys everything about you but she doesn't sound like she's quite ready to fully commit. She was probably looking for that excuse to go to nl and see/speak with you on occasion. When that fell through it became real again that she would be long term close to you longer. Now she just wants to move out. She is holding you around cause you are a potential partner for marriage but she is not there yet. She has more living she wants to do before she fully commits. You have a choice give space manage your expectations see where it leads in time or save yourself the limbo experiment and focus on yourself for a while and see if you stumble on someone else.

I found my wife when I stopped looking and trying to make things work. We also we're in and out of each other's lives for years before we got serious. 

Now you..your living abroad, seperated from friends family barely making your life work just for a relationship. Relationships that matter both people bend together if they choose to bend at all. They don't allow their partners to live like you are living and don't see an issue with it. Truly think about what you want, need where do you see yourself in 5 years and block her out of the picture. Then once you figure that out see if you can truly see her in the picture of those goals.

I say this with the best intentions. Best of luck finding yourself.","it's funny but true and i'm 40m so i've lived a lot of this.","funny but true","funny","but",FALSE,"funny but true","true",NA,NA,1,"reddit",0.26806,"thick_non-moral_concepts_POS","positive",NA,NA,"thick_non-moral_concepts"

"My best friend from high school has schizophrenia, so this isn't first-hand experience, but I obviously was there the whole time that she was slipping.

In 8th grade, we were on a field trip, and had to walk from one park (where we did a bunch of science experiments) to another park (where we did fun stuff and had a picnic).  Sarah\* told me an elaborate story of traveling to Cuba illegally via France with a few of our teachers.  She'd often go on long tangents of ""what if"" sorts of stories in such a manner that you'd think that she believed they'd actually happened.  She also had a terrible time concentrating in school.   She shouldn't have passed 8th grade based on how much school she missed and how bad her grades were, but she was passed on to high school.

By 10th grade, she had a voice in her head that no one believed her on.  Charles\* was a flamboyant, promiscuous gay man inside of her head.  Everyone thought that this was cute and funny, but in reality, she was fighting for control of her mind with Charles.  By the end of 11th grade, two more voices emerged in her mind- one a timid, bottle-up-the-emotions girl named Kara\* and a very angry man named Casey\*.  When they weren't actively whispering into her mind/ears, she referred to it as them being in their ""board meeting"", on how they were going to influence her actions next.

I know that she has looked back quite a bit on her childhood and looked at the exceptionally elaborate fantasy worlds that she created, and wondered if pro-dromal schizophrenia was to blame.  I didn't meet her until 6th grade, when we were 11 and 12.  She was absolutely obsessed with Rob Zombie and would lose herself in the universes that he'd create within his movies and music.  Losing oneself within an obsession or addiction can be a sign of hiding from how one's brain is actually functioning, too.  She also had a very hard time processing her emotions and understanding why/how others felt the way that they felt.

The last straw was covering the windows in foil so that she wouldn't feel like she was being watched.  Her parents finally admitted soemthing was wrong and got her into a doctor.  Her personality has changed drastically with the medication she is on- she has near 0 symptoms, but she and I are no longer friends.  I have texted her maybe 4 times since her birthday in June, and she has been very short with me since.  I'm not sure what happened, exactly, but I know she went on new medication in June, just before her 22nd birthday. 

**TL;DR:** Watched my best friend slip over the course of 7 years before getting help at age 18.  Story telling, losing herself in fiction, ""voices in the head"" symptoms, lack of emotion, etc.","everyone thought that this was cute and funny, but in reality, she was fighting for control of her mind with charles.","cute and funny","funny","but",FALSE,"cute and funny","cute",NA,NA,0,"reddit",0.59606,"thick_non-moral_concepts_POS","positive",NA,NA,"thick_non-moral_concepts"

"Stand up - James Acaster, Lee Mack, Jimmy Carr, John Mulaney, Ricky Gervais, David Mitchell, Sean Lock, Richard Ayoade, Jon Richardson.

I really recommend British panel shows like Would I lie to you?, The Big Fat Quiz, Nevermind the Buzzcocks, Cats does Countdown, Taskmaster, etc. They usually have comedians on and it's mostly not scripted. Brits are known for their sense of humour and having indulged in those kind of shows for the past 5 or so years, I see a huge difference in myself. I can think on my feet and come up with interesting things to say on the spot. These panel shows have comedians interacting with each other which is much better for people on this thread, you want to learn how to have a fun back and forth rather than shooting off one liners. If you've good company, they're not just going to laugh at your jokes, they're going to respond to them. I used to just worry about being funny but real life is less like a stand up show, your audience is not passive. A few years ago, if I were in a social setting, I'd come up with something hilarious and say my joke, most of the times, somebody else would respond with something funnier and get a bigger laugh but having only cared about being funny and coming up jokes, I struggled to keep up the momentum and used to get annoyed that the 'responder' to my joke actually stole the show by being way funnier. So yeah, I'd say that it's far more important to know how to keep the momentum going and feed off of other people's jokes instead of just coming up with one liners. I think these shows help a lot with that.

There's always something to learn from the comedians I mentioned above, they don't all do stand up per se but are well regarded in the comedy scene.

Ricky Gervais can put a comedic spin on dark and morbid situations.

James Acaster is, I think, one of the greatest comedians of our generation who hasn't been discovered by many. I really recommend his Netflix special but also his classic scrapes. It's a part of a radio show where he talks about how he gets himself into ridiculous situations. For his comedy, he plays this super socially awkward guy who struggles to make eye contact, etc but he sometimes breaks his character in this show which makes it evident that he's actually kind of cool but is not embarrassed by coming off as a nerd. I find it really attractive when people seem to have an onion like personality, i.e, they have different layers to it instead of trying to be the cool guy or the funny guy or the nerdy guy. I usually play the part of a shy introvert, that is me 90% of the time and that's what my jokes are based on but then sometimes I'd break it and say something savage which makese come off as really cool (According to my friends), even though I'm not.

David Mitchell and Richard Ayoade are really nerdy comedians. DM is very eloquent and so is Ayoade. Ayoade is so ridiculous! He wrote a book on a movie called  ""A view from the top"", this movie is a mediocre, mindless work of fiction but he reviewed it as though it's a classic. Y'all, this guy wrote a whole ass book about it. I really recommend watching [this clip](https://youtu.be/o0BWXXM8Q9o) of him promoting the book on Graham Norton.

If you read the transcript of John Mulaney's stand up, you'll notice that it's just a collection of stories but his delivery is what makes him hilarious.

I can go on and on about these comedians but the point I want to make is, if you want to learn how to be funny, watch these shows to observe how these jokes are written or framed not just as an audience but as an analyst. If you watch enough content by each comedian, you'll notice how there's always a recurring theme. For eg, Lee Mack (legend) is always making jokes about how he's from the north/working class and pointing out the differences between middle class and working class people. Richard Ayoade jokes about his reclusive behaviour, John Mulaney jokes about his run in with drugs and alcohol.

Try to learn from them and see if there are things that apply in your life. Really get to know yourself, ask yourself what kind of person you are and if you don't know then ask those who are closest to you. If you don't have an extremely low self esteem, try to be a little self deprecating and laugh at yourself, this, I feel, kills two birds with one stone, you're getting a laugh but you're also telling people that they can't hurt your feelings by saying something rude because you know how to take a joke. Most people are worried about offending others, self-deprecation solves that problem because you can't offend yourself. 

To end this rant, I feel like you don't have to be hilarious to be popular or whatever it is you're trying to get. Having a cute personality is enough to do the trick, regardless of your gender.

"Every pancake has two sides. I’m the other side of the pancake. Just here to say, as I’m a business owner, I have a lawyer on retainer. If photos of my bloody and bruised face are sent online along with my name there will be a cease and desist. 

I’m not getting into the details that OP posted, or the way certain things are entirely false, twisted, or left out. I will have a police report number soon enough but I agree to no contact moving forward, as it really is best. OP can find the report himself as I’m sure he’ll keep calling the cops about it

Yes OP. When you called the cops multiple times to do a check person on me for whatever reason, after explaining the attack on me, I was told you have called repeatedly and I should get a restraining order against you based on your calls. 

I’m embarrassed on your behalf you would post this online, and reading these comments about me being crazy really hurt and I’m sad people would validate whatever is going on with you as being the healthy opinion to have, even if I was lying and you had evidence to prove it.

For the record, because I have lived so long with this burden, and in case anyone else is a survivor of incest or abuse of any kind, there will be people who don’t believe you. Especially if it’s someone charming or successful or well known as was my abuser was in childhood. Please see a psychologist or psychiatrist who specializes in these things. In my case I have complex PTSD which is a different diagnosis in the DSM. It’s more common in women than men. I have accepted I am mentally ill - I have depression, CPTSD, anxiety, panic disorder, and dissociative/derealization symptoms. I have never been diagnosed with a personality disorder. But if anyone reading has, that does not make you crazy. BPD is under reported in men. So there is a bias that it’s just crazy women doing crazy women things. You don’t matter any less. Mental illness is just that, it is a tangible thing, it’s all in your head literally. You can not control serotonin dopamine, side effects of certain drugs, etc. just hang in there and you will find the medication that works for you if you have a team of professionals.

OP, I have a degree in psychology. I was drawn to that field because I wanted to help others. Not to use that knowledge to be a sociopath, as you are making me out to be. 

If anyone receives a photo from OP, once you marvel at my alleged movie worthy special effects and makeup. Please report it. I’m a business owner and don’t want this shit out there. And OP I have taken down all my social media so no one can find me. I live with fear that that “man” will find me and finish what he intended.

I met my half brother, turned out we weren’t related, we started dating, and I think that’s a pretty funny “how did you meet” story. Weird, but funny.

She could just say the kids underestimated how big the damage was to the boat where it got them killed or something. Lily is also a good liar but yeah, you’d think they’d come back, especially if Lily was killed as well. 

Clem probably wouldn’t get involved in the war or risk being in that and besides, she can’t really do much about it anyway. She only has one leg and the kids don’t have to help in that war.

"The funny but sad thing is that modern academic philosophy is much more about believing or comparing philosophers at individual face value instead of trying to reach what they sought through assimilating and understanting the multitude of points of view they gifted us and putting them to the test.


In my view everyone that puts his/her love of knowledge in action should be deemed a Philosopher. One who is merely studying other philosophers without putting what was learned in practice through his/her own unique view of it is practicing ""love for the ""love of knowledge"""", a philophilosophia if you will, with too much philos, and not enough sophia. These I would say are the vast majority, the ones you righly labelled in your OP as ""believers"". I think the cure for this accute ""beliefitis"" could be convincing some of them believers, or in others words, make them believe, that they can be Philosophers too, achieve high peaks of human and even universal understanding, and be greater than every single one of his/her predecessors by learning how to stand on their shoulders.

I'm not your dad but if you say, even if jokingly, that you are a Philosopher, knowing the scope and importance of the contributions you made, i'd have but to nod and agree.

&gt;Rarely was there a mention of any other factors, that she was feeling tired from overwork, that he was exhausted from being a new father, or finding it hard to come to terms with the fact that his wife was now the milky mother of his children, and no longer the nubile sex vixen he first snogged on the floor of the student union building to the sound of Don't You Want Me? by the Human League in 1983.

"The training area at Meaford is home to a huge population of racoons. Troops in the field have to be constantly aware of the furry bandits and the list of precautions is long. Most encounters are harmless and even funny, but not always. We were advised not to take food into our tents, because racoons can sniff their way through any camouflage. A buddy of mine took a four pack of Dad's cookies, wrapped in cellophane, and popped it into a zip lock bag, which he put into the outer pocket of his ruck. In the middle of the night he awoke to find a small racoon working to open the pocket flap. The animal was right beside his bed, so he reached over and whacked it on the end of its nose.

"Based on my many games in casual Conquest you have the following roles before the match starts:

Role #1: The **Insta-locker** Person who picks a god like Sun Wuking, that can jungle, support, or solo. This person never communicates which role they want to play, then randomly wanders around the map. Very common in EST morning times.


Role #2 **Know-It-All** Person calls a role, and selects the Uber-God-du-Jour. Then they tell other people what to pick for the roles they called. If you pick differently then their recommendations, then you're ""Noobs, and should uninstall and go back to LOL""


Role #3 **META-Breaker** These are they people who want to play Ra in the Jungle, Thanatos as a tank, Ares mid, Chang'e Jungle, or Merc as an ADC. When someone questions their selection the reply is always centered around how they are in the Diamond league, and they do this all the time. They are not in Diamond, and they always fail.


Role #4 The **Grinder** Selects a god before calling the role, then trying to make the god selection fit whatever they can. They don't insta-lock, but they refuse to change because they are ""one win away from mastering."" This is my personal hell for the first two weeks after a new god is released.


Role #5 The **AFK asshat** Starting to be come more common in Bronze league, this person clicks accept for match selection then is either abducted by aliens, or is distracted by a nearby shiny object. They forget that they are playing a game and wander off, never to be heard from again.


Then there are the In-Game roles:

Role #1 **The General** There is a reason Generals no longer lead from the front lines. They are so focused on the big picture they cannot direct troops or fight at the tactical level. This asshat is so busy telling you how to play your role that they cannot play theirs. Inevitably, when they begin to lose their lane, it is obviously everyone else's fault because they are not following orders. 


Role #2 The **Bad Mouther** I had a match a month ago with one clown, playing Agni, was ripping everyone a new asshole all match. I was playing jungle as Arachne, and was doing very well. A lot of chance encounters with the other jungler, a Thor IIRC, ended with me the victor. In short order i was dominating the match. (not bragging here, I'm a solid player, not some God playing Gods.) I was like 10/0/2 and trying to ignore this guy. Normally, I would have muted him, but he was very good at communicating when mid left his lane and he'd shoot me a ping when he saw Thor cross his lane or try for a Mid XP camp. I went to steal their Speed, and ran into four of the other team. I died. So this asshole starts laying into me for being 11/1/2 - I killed one of them with my poison - and I couldn't take it. I shouldn't have, but I began BM this clown right back. I KS'd every kill by pulling them out of his Ult with mine. It was quite funny, but very sad at the same time.


Role #3 The **MMO player** They almost always play Jungle, but occasionally someone in Solo or the ADC does this. They just want to level. They never leave the jungle to gank, or leave the lane. It is all about the EXP. To these guys, the game doesn't start until level 20, when they can go raiding. 


Role #4 The **Build Master** They have every build used by the top players memorized and heaven help you if you buy any non-approved item. They usually revert to being a Bad Mouther when you don't follow their perceived builds exactly. I forgot about these nitwits until I was recently experimenting with not buying boots on Sun Wuking in solo lane when facing  predominately physical teams, and a physical solo on the other side. Witchstone has a 15% movement rate. Tabi have 18%. Sun Wuking has no problems with mobility. Anyways I finished 8/5/16 or so, but I had to mute the **Build Master**.


Role #5  **The Camper** This player has a Viagra fueled hard-on for the Gold Fury, the Fire Giant, or both. As soon as he hits level 12 he begins spamming VAF or VAG endlessly. The second they spawn, his is mashing that macro key every 2 seconds. You could have all the enemies towers down, the phoenixes dead, just scored a Diecide, and the ~~Minotaur~~ Titan at half health. If his binky camp spawns, though, he expects everyone to rush over there to kill it, instead of finishing the match. I've seen these chuckleheads leave the enemies room, when ONE more hit could have ended the damn game.

"At the risk of being overly annoyingly obscure here are my picks. Three of which I implore you to watch and two of which you all have almost certainly seen:

\*\*Marlina the Murderer in Four Acts\*\* dir. Mouly Surya (2 points)

An Indonesian spaghetti western directed by and starring women. Every frame of this movie is impeccable, everything is just so perfectly framed always. That's a great thing for any movie, but it's especially wonderful for a western that holds on its sweeping vistas letting us just drink in how beautiful it is. I'm struggling to come up with other things to write about this. But it's beautiful, deliberately paced, surprisingly sweet and funny at moments, and not quite as violent as expected for a rape revenge western where the weapons used are machetes. As of now it can be rented on Amazon in the US.

\*\*Tigers Are Not Afraid\*\* dir. Issa Lopez (1 point)

A magical realist story about children living through Mexico’s cartel wars. Beautiful, scary, funny, and super affecting. I'm a sucker for movies about kids and this pulled in my love for horror and magical realism and swirled them all together into a movie that made me both jump at a jump scare and tear up with joy and sadness, sometimes at the same time. And yes, it's definitely similar to Pan's Labyrinth, but the way it brings us into a group of kids and the way that they are genuinely sweet and angry with one another really adds something.

\*\*November\*\* dir. Rainer Sarnet (1 point)

An Estonian folk story, or amalgamation of folk stories. It’s full of different creatures and things that seem absurd to an outsider perspective so I don't know what it means, but it's one of the most gorgeous movies I've ever seen and it made me feel spooked and also made me laugh way more than expected. 

\*\*Annihilation\*\* dir. Alex Garland (1 point)

I won’t say that I understand it but I loved a lot of it, which is maybe why the not great expository dialogue and awkward dialogue in general at many points hurt me more. But hey if you just keep swinging from tension to gore to pretty colors the way this does there’s no way I’m not gonna like it. Also the score and the way it switches in the finale brought me great joy. 

\*\*First Reformed\*\* dir. Paul Schrader (1 point)

Ethan Hawke can eat my ass

On first viewing I walked out of the theater and didn’t want to do anything but just think about the movie for a bit, so that’s a big win. On second viewing it became clear that I love this movie. There's an early conversation where Ethan Hawke's character references my favorite Kierkegaard book that on my first viewing grabbed me and pulled me into the movie, and during my second viewing I couldn't stop thinking ""fuck I love this."" It’s also surprisingly funny. But it doesn’t treat its female characters well at all which is disappointing for a movie this good, and I do not like the ending and it’s weird loving a movie and not liking its ending. 

Honorable mentions:

\*\*Thoroughbreds\*\*, a truly amazing thriller with two fantastic lead performances and a beautifully painful final performance from Anton Yelchin. \*\*Blindspotting\*\*, the best movie about race and gentrification in America in a year that was really good for movies about race and gentrification in America. \*\*Sweet Country\*\*, a beautifully shot Australian western that investigates Australia’s racist history in powerful and often brutal ways. 

Superlatives/oscar snubs:

\*\*Director:\*\* Lynne Ramsey for You Were Never Really Here. While this didn’t make my top 5 or honorable mentions it’s definitely one of my favorites of the year and the only movie that made me think “holy shit she’s a genius” in relation to a director. That moment came during the brothel scene if you’ve seen it. And if you haven’t, please do. I'm glad to see that it's getting a good amount of love here. 

\*\*Actor:\*\* Ethan Hawke in First Reformed. I don’t think this one needs anymore discussion, it’s just ridiculous. And while I didn’t love the movie, Matt Dillon in The House That Jack Built was really fantastic. 

\*\*Actress:\*\* Again didn’t love the movie but Toni Collette was incredible in Hereditary. One thing the Oscars did get right (for me) was nominating all three leads from the Favourite. 

\*\*Cinematography:\*\* If Beale Street Could Talk was the most lush movie I’ve seen since Phantom Thread, which no wasn’t long ago, but they’re both just so gorgeous to look at. 

\*\*Score:\*\* Johann Johansson’s score for Mandy is otherworldly, I’ve loved him for years and cried when he died last year, but he left us with an incredible testament to his genius as his final score. And Annihilation’s score, the way it builds an acoustic world for an hour and a half only to suddenly switch to wonky electronics in the finale is brilliant.

"So I would say something like this chapter where she makes no moves on Komi herself, but rather obsesses over something she gave her is very different from, like, the twister chapter.  Or the multiple chapters where she tries to make Komi exercise to get a look at her leggings or something.  You are right, it's blurry, but I'm able to find ""character obsesses over another one from afar"" a lot more funny than ""character tries to put other character in compromising positions and touch her.""  The first is kinda along the lines of how the other students worship Komi, the second is a sexual preditor.  So I guess in the case of Yamai I would define it as whether Komi is being actively manipulated/touched.

(And yes, I know in real life that is ABSOLUTELY NOT where the line is, but in the case of this gag comic that's where I draw it.  Similarly to how I find slapstick funny but real life violence not)

Also I think the bigger distinction is ""side character"" vs ""focus of a chapter.""

"This week I read Charlie Kaufman's new novel, _Antkind_. It's roughly what you'd expect from him: the first-person pov of an extremely neurotic, hapless, vain, obsessive movie critic. Memory, consciousness, time, doubles, etc. He finds an outsider artist who has made a film that's 3 months long that nobody has ever seen, the director dies and the film burns up, and things start going crazy in a zany Kaufmanesque way as the critic tries to recover his memories of the film. 

The first half or so is extremely funny, until it goes completely off the rails into repetitive psychedelic weirdness at which point it loses most of its charm. There's a long digression on clown fetishism which starts like this:

&gt;At the trade show, I meet a woman in greasepaint, well, not in greasepaint, well, not only in greasepaint, but also selling it. So to be clear, both in greasepaint and in greasepaint. I picture her naked but with the clown makeup on, and instantly I realize a new fetish has been born. My synaptic train has a new stop: Clowntown. This is not at all like me, I think. Once home, I type clown fetish into my computer. I hesitate before hitting RETURN. There is no going back after RETURN; of this, from past experience, I am certain. The only thing the virtual world offers that the real world doesn’t is both complete privacy and a complete lack of privacy. I am alone with it but being watched: my activities recorded, files made, boxes ticked. But, alas, my needs are larger than my concern. It will all be there for me at the press of a button. I consider the button itself: ENTER/RETURN. I consider the world I am about to enter; I know I will return again and again. There is no end to it. And what deranged Pandora’s box will I be opening? Are there laws against clown porn? I think I’m safe as long as I don’t search underage clown porn, which I would never, ever do. I am not a monster. Yet once I taste clown, will I be able to go back to regular women, either in my fantasies or in reality? Will there come a point, if I ever manage to find a woman who will have me, when I will pull the clown white out from the bottom of my sock drawer and ask her to apply it, just so I can get hard? That will not go well. Best to not press RETURN and just accept that— I take the plunge and … it is better than I could’ve imagined. Luscious naked clown women. So many choices! FYI, there are some naked male clowns, which it turns out are as disturbing as naked female clowns are alluring. I refine my search to exclude them and this time don’t hesitate to press RETURN. I come upon (both literally and figuratively!) the image of one young female clown who embodies everything I have ever wanted in a female naked clown. She goes by the name Rainbow Sunshine and she is … everything.

There's all sorts of contemporary references that are going to be dated within a year (including an entire chapter told from the perspective of president Trump in which he fucks an animatronic version of himself). The main character is also woke which Kaufman satirizes on virtually every single page...sometimes funny, but mostly tiresome.

&gt; I telephone my friend Ocky, who coincidentally has been in therapy starting from when we first became friends.
&gt; 
&gt; “Hello?”
&gt; 
&gt; “Ocky, it’s me,” I say.
&gt; 
&gt; “Hello.”
&gt; 
&gt; “I’ve been thinking of seeing a ‘shrink.’ ”
&gt; 
&gt; “OK.”
&gt; 
&gt; “I am calling to ask for the number of your ‘shrink.’ ”
&gt; 
&gt; “Sorry.”
&gt; 
&gt; “Sorry?”
&gt; 
&gt; “I can’t let you see my therapist, B.”
&gt; 
&gt; “Why?”
&gt; 
&gt; “We talk about you. It would be a conflict of interest for thon.”
&gt; 
&gt; “Your therapist is a thon?”
&gt; 
&gt; “No. But I prefer not to even be specific about thon’s gender.”
&gt; 
&gt; “Why?”
&gt; 
&gt; “I’m afraid it might allow you to track thon down and see thon behind my back.”
&gt; 
&gt; “Just by knowing thon’s gender?”
&gt; 
&gt; “Thon’s gender is so specific as to be almost unique.”
&gt; 
&gt; “Fine. Well, do you know of any other ‘shrinks’ who are supposed to be good?”
&gt; 
&gt; “I have heard tell of a Dr. Bismo in Harlem.”
&gt; 
&gt; “B-i-s-m-o?” I ask, spelling it out.
&gt; 
&gt; “H-a-r-l-e-m.”
&gt; 
&gt; “No, the therapist’s name.”
&gt; 
&gt; “Oh. Yes, then.”
&gt; 
&gt; “Do you know his first name?”
&gt; 
&gt; “Interesting that you assume it is a he. Sexist much?”
&gt; 
&gt; “Her name then?”
&gt; 
&gt; “It’s a male.”
&gt; 
&gt; “Then, why—”
&gt; 
&gt; “I just thought your assumption was telling.”
&gt; 
&gt; “What is his first name?”
&gt; 
&gt; “Frederick G.”
&gt; 
&gt; “Thank you,” I say.
&gt; 
&gt; “I hope it helps you. I really think this is long overdue.”
&gt; 
&gt; “Thank you, Ocky.”
&gt; 
&gt; I hang up. Ocky, my oldest and dearest friend, is a terrible person. The thing is he is even more cisgender than I. His high horse is a defensive mechanism. I would pity him if I didn’t despise him. Dr. Frederick G. Bismo is an African American, I hope. There is a good chance because his office is in Harlem, although with the current gentrification (the Harlem Shame-aissance, I call it) of that area, it is impossible to know. But I would enjoy talking about this issue with an African American. He would undoubtedly notice how seriously I take the artistry of his fellow African Americans and we would bond over that since he would recognize me as an ally.
&gt; 
&gt; Frederick G. Bismo is white. Possibly Scandinavian, that’s how white. Tall, blond, and severe. He seems to despise me. Perhaps he is not a good fit. Or perhaps this is just what I need—a form of tough love. Or tough hate. Perhaps I should give him a chance.
&gt; 
&gt; “Tell me how I can help,” he says.
&gt; 
&gt; You tell me, I think. You’re the goddamn “shrink.”
&gt; 
&gt; “I’m having some problems,” I say.
&gt; 
&gt; “I see,” he says.
&gt; 
&gt; What do you see? I think. I’ve told you nothing. Why don’t you ask me what the problems are? Must I play both of our parts? Must I always—
&gt; 
&gt; “What sort of problems?” he asks.
&gt; 
&gt; Finally.
&gt; 
&gt; “Thank you for asking. For starters, I’m having some problems remembering.”
&gt; 
&gt; I’m hoping he will say, //Oh, that’s quite common at your age. Nothing to worry about.//
&gt; 
&gt; “That is worrisome,” he says.
&gt; 
&gt; “Really?”
&gt; 
&gt; “Do you get lost trying to get home?”
&gt; 
&gt; “No! For God’s sake! No! Egads, man!”
&gt; 
&gt; “Well, what sort of memory problems then?”
&gt; 
&gt; This man is a joke.
&gt; 
&gt; “I cannot remember the details of a film I have watched.”
&gt; 
&gt; “Oh,” he says. “That is nothing. Movies are a disposable art form.”
&gt; 
&gt; I hate this man.
&gt; 
&gt; “I am a film critic by profession, as well as by passion,” I say.
&gt; 
&gt; “I see. Well, then, why not just watch it again and take notes this time?”
&gt; 
&gt; “The one copy of the film has been destroyed.”
&gt; 
&gt; “Destroyed?”
&gt; 
&gt; “Yes, in a terrible fire or tsunami.”
&gt; 
&gt; “This is a very unusual circumstance.”
&gt; 
&gt; “Perhaps,” I say.
&gt; 
&gt; I don’t want to get pally-wally with this man. I am not about to make small talk.
&gt; 
&gt; “What should I do?”
&gt; 
&gt; “Why don’t you discuss it with the filmmaker? Perhaps he remembers it?”
&gt; 
&gt; “He?”
&gt; 
&gt; “She?”
&gt; 
&gt; “She?”
&gt;

"Again, it would make the most sense if Lily is alive to say that they all just died, including the kids. She could just say the kids underestimated how big the damage was to the boat where it got them killed or something. Lily is also a good liar but yeah, you’d think they’d come back, especially if Lily was killed as well. 

Clem probably wouldn’t get involved in the war or risk being in that and besides, she can’t really do much about it anyway. She only has one leg and the kids don’t have to help in that war. Also, what I meant about that idea, included having both of her legs. I think the story would be better that way. They could save Clem losing her leg for later if they want to end the series with her being alive. People wouldn’t shut up about wanting another continuation if she’s still alive and had both her legs.

Stephen Colbert plays a character. His entire letter format is written in his character's voice.

Do you know who owns Comedy Central?

A guy named Sumner Redstone who has a habit of [bribing reporters](pr-blunder-of-the-year-sumner-redstone-says-reporter-will-be-well-rewarded-for-disclosing-a-source).

He owns Viacom, which is a massive media conglomerate that is made up of Comedy Central, BET, CBS, MTV and a bunch of movie studios and other stuff.

He's basically the leftist version of Rupert Murdoch.

Stephen Colbert is great and funny but me personally, I think his bosses are fucking scary. You guys are happy about the fact that he just got his PAC allowed. I am not happy about that.

It opens a door where corporations on both sides can fund any kind of fucked up campaign message they want and the general public will get a shitload more disinformation.

"I just reached this part of the game. I’ve been staring helplessly at the tv screen for a couple of minutes, shocked, silent, my grieving is still not over and I will be taking my time with this. I have never imagined that a very cute, lovely and lighthearted game like this would hit me at the back like a sudden brick on the face. As the player, when I first met Bobby the bomb-omb it was awkward but funny and adorable. At first I didn’t know what to do with him. Then we knew that he had amnesia. When me and Olivia offered for him to join us to create new memories. He joined us, we laughed, ran from bad guys, we even fought some of them fearlessly. We even ate together some canned tuna and it was an amazing time. The thing is, he did now even know what his story was so this is why he didn’t tell mario and olivia anything. But when olivia was crushed under the boulder and would be stuck forever, bobby looked at me and said that he wanted a favor. He asked if we could go to that ship and fetch something important because he assured us that that it would save Olivia. So we went on another adventure, little did I know that it would be the last time I would ever see his innocent and adorable little face. That friend face that made me miss him so much after all these adventures. I can’t stop crying over this. I am now running out of breath as I am typing this because I tend to succeed at expressing myself a lot when I write so I could let it out. My dear friend, our lovely, kind, adorable, funny, courageous and white-hearted Bobby. Our friend is gone. I’m crying now and I can’t continue this game. I need to take a little break. If I knew, if mario knew, if anyone of us knew what was going on in his mind we would have NEVER agreed to go to that ship. Olivia would have NEVER agreed to this. I love you bomb-omb. I love and miss you Bobby already. So much, you poor, sweet courageous little boy. Our buddy had already a tough time before all this. Then this happens.. damn you nintendo.

The charm made you like the show, which meant you were emotionally invested in the characters when it got more serious.

The thing was, Buffy (and Angel, and Babylon 5, and Firefly, and other good sci-fi/fantasy) has *charm* - it's confident and self-deprecating, and even when it's clever it doesn't let on that it knows it.  If it was a person it would be Nathan Fillion or Neil Patrick Harris - confident and clever, but not taking themselves too seriously and never afraid to take the piss out of themselves.

Abrams' sci-fi is like the kind of self-important idiots you sometimes run into in r/science or r/conspiracy - utterly charmless people convinced of their own genius, unaware that there's anything more to the subjects they're opining on than their own shallow misapprehensions, and apparently incapable of realising they might be less than perfect, let alone capable of making a *joke* about their own fallibility or at their own expense.

If his shows were people they'd be Deepak Chopra, or Jenny McCarthy, or Ben Stein, or a small toddler that's shuffling about in his dad's shoes with a tie looped around his neck, throwing noisy tantrums when everyone refuses to talk to him like and adult and let him drive cars.

An adult doing an impression of a kid can be funny, and a kid pretending to be an adult *who knows he's pretending* is funny, but a kid who pouts and throws a tantrum and runs around kicking shins because you won't let them drink and stay out all night is just obnoxious and annoying.

Basically, *if you could adequately judge a creator from his work*, Whedon would be confident, self-deprecating, funny and very smart.  J. Michael Straczynski would be nerdy but intelligent, but Abrams would be a self-important retard who insists what he's doing is sci-fi, even while writing stories about ""m̶a̶g̶i̶c **science** flying ponies"" and ""m̶y̶t̶h̶i̶c̶a̶l **hyper quantum superstring multiverse** elves"".

The sad thing is that while his method of storytelling is a bit ""all foreplay and no fuck"", if he stopped trying to play grown-ups and stopped taking his plots and characters *so goddamn seriously* he'd actually be a much better writer. :-(","basically, *if you could adequately judge a creator from his work*, whedon would be confident, self-deprecating, funny and very smart.","funny and very","funny","but",FALSE,"funny and very smart","smart",NA,"very",1,"reddit",0.6418,"thick_non-moral_concepts_POS","positive",0.1983,NA,"thick_non-moral_concepts"

True story here. When I was little, like 3 years old, my mom's best friends family had a pet turtle that I was completely terrified of.

Also, there is a slight delay on quest turn in sometimes that makes you unable to move for a second upon exiting the quest giver screen.

The list of mechanical bugs in this game is scary long and in lapse repair.  But, with how they develop and their priorities, I don't see it ever changing.  So many that a lot of people just expect and work around it til a new game comes along.  It'll impact them most if they ever try to launch another new game.  People will take pause on investing in another game from ZOS unless they are just ES junkies.

"This is just a fall limerick I wrote for you, not an entry. It's not funny, but full of seasonal imagery.

Sweet Summer fades out of existence
While Autumn takes over the business
Rebranding it all, nicknaming it 'Fall'
But surely, she'll need some assistance.

The flowers and grasses they've laid in?
Their flourish, their flair is now fading.
Prepared to retire, but not yet expire,
It seems it's first frost they're evading.

They plaintively cry to the trees
'Protect us, oh willn't you please?
Oranges and yellows make pleasant bedfellows,
So blanket our beds with your leaves!'

The trees are a sight to behold.
Now emerald! Now auburn! Now gold!
In one long encore, just a few shivers more
Leaves them naked, but ah! who can scold?

The wind is a clever enchantress
She flits and she floats and she dances
She nips at the beasts, warns them to retreat
""It's nearly that time, take no chances!""

The beasties have heard this fair warning
Gather in the food they've been storing
So no cold bites their bones, they'll spruce up their homes:
The dens and the caves and the warrens.

So, you see, it's not all without effort
Miss Autumn's employees are clever.

The comment itself was deleted but if you check FastOCR33's comment history, it capped at +63 before it got deleted by an /r/Videos mod. Not to be confused with a later comment where he also said ""niggers gonna nig"" and got downvoted en masse.

Also, considering I got banned for using the word ""stinkpipe"" on SRS, then had the illegitimate ban upheld and labelled a homophobe and shitposter by their moderators, just because I said ""faggot"" in a different subreddit some time ago within my comment history and this guy **didn't** get banned for using the word ""nigger"" twice, I think SRS have gone downhill.

"I have a friend who has been completely blind from birth and he has difficulties with women as well.  A lot of it is mental... because he's blind he is extremely habituated and organized (a place for everything, everything in its place), so doing things spontaneously is more difficult for him.  He lives in a place that is not convenient to a major city or mass transit, so dates are much harder as well.

He's charming and funny, but he never escalates because kino is much harder to establish.  For instance when he goes to shake hands he just sort of puts his hand in the general right area and it's up to the other person to put their hand in his.

Honestly one of the best things we ever came up with was to use his blindness as a direct ice breaker.  He would go up to a girl, act like he was looking her up and down and then say ""I may be blind but you're looking fine!"" or something else goofy as hell.

Youtuber James Marriott showed me her so I didin´t even know she got to have her own ""late night show"" thing but .. ugh it pains me to say this but it was SO UN-funny that Jimmy Kimmel is funnier that her and to me he is Not funny , maby he has his few moments but it´s just not for me. Which is fine!  
But Lilly and Amy has this Narcessistic vibe and pull the ""feminist"" card out where its just not necessary.   


Also Amy reminds me of this mythomaniac girl I went to school with and it doesn't help but thats besides the point and just a personal thing but it sure dosen´t help that Amy steals jokes AND denies it - atleast she could have saved herself by saing she got inspired by some comedians and didin´t realize and take it better and grow from it , it would have gotten her some respect from me but STILL - she is naturally UN-funny in my opinion - and her vagina jokes are just bad.

The truth is that, as is often hinted at but rarely stated, Starfleet is the most efficient, well-trained and well-equipped organization in the galaxy.  Their best officers are literally the finest heroes of the entire world-spanning Federation, much less the Earth.  They are not incompetent in any way, shape or form.

"As mentioned, Bable is very prevalent in smaller towns and rural areas, less-so in larger cities (such as Gijón or Oviedo). The official road signs of the names of towns and cities (those seen upon entering and exiting) are written in Castellano and Asturiano (i.e. Entrepeñas/Entrepenes). It is offered as a course in many secondary schools and universities. Bable is the generic denomination yet in Asturias it can be divided into western, central, and eastern dialects. The official version, as taught in schools, is the central version. In my opinion, it is just as much a language as Gallego or Catalán, employing distinct linguistic phenomena such as the “che vaqueira”, distinct vocabulary, and distinct verb forms. Many Asturians take pride in their language, even the “pijos” from the big cities that think Bable is for “paletos” will still pretend to speak it and say they like Dixebra (funny but true).

There is good evidence that this was done because they didn't want us to be associated with ""Nestorians"", the Assyrians belonging to the Church of the East, since they were known to fight back, which led to the Simele massacre of 1933 in Iraq, after which the clergy of the SOC became hardcore anti-Assyrian to the point where they would disrespect anything to do with the Church of the East.

"His Novels: The reason people are still going to be reading Wallace in 150 years. Again, you've got 3 to choose from, the freshman effort [Broom of the System](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6750.The_Broom_of_the_System), the magnum opus [Infinite Jest](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6759.Infinite_Jest), and the posthumously published [The Pale King](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9443405-the-pale-king). I think Wallace's strengths as a writer, the long, coursing passages and psychologically damaged characters talking past one another, are best captured in this form. Harold Bloom characterizes his style as ""maximalist,"" as opposed to ""minimalist,"" and while I'm not sure I agree completely with that characterization it does a good job of capturing what it feels like to read pages of Wallace. All the information you thought you could need and then some. But it's worth it! All the information you are being inundated with comes with a payoff. The only thing is that payoff is usually 250 pages down the road or hidden in a footnote. That makes his novels feel very dense, but also gives them a feeling of claustrophobia and inter-connectedness reminiscent of Pynchon but not nearly so paranoiac. What this style allows him to do is present the total deluge of information and competing realities (the corporate reality, the objective reality, the televised reality, the microcosmic reality of the nuclear family,) in a way where they can all coexist and confuse and compete with one another, in a way that I feel is very reminiscent of contemporary American life. I'm sure of life in any modernized country, but it is presented in a particularly American way. People can agree or disagree with that, but it's for that kind of artistic portrayal that I keep coming back to his works.

Broom of the System, if we want to continue the Pynchon comparison, is to Infinite Jest as V is to Gravity's Rainbow. But not quite as good as V. Probably my least favorite Wallace book. It comes off as a book written by a really smart college kid trying to show you how smart he is. Which it is.

Infinite Jest. This is the big one. Certainly his best work. After Broom of the System in '87 and Girl with Curious Hair in '89 he doesn't publish another fiction book until 1996. Before it comes out it's hyped to high heaven by his publisher, and oddly enough, lives up to it. The New Sincerity wiki article I linked at the top really starts to come through here, where the tenets of AA are considered as actual philosophical imperatives. Cliches are cliches because they work. Wallace's first two works are ironic and funny, but Infinite Jest has soul. And the name of that soul is Don Gately. Unarguably the best character he ever created, and completely original. The (literally) block-headed employee at the halfway house, a recovered thief and opiate addict, his story of redemption (confused as it is by the structure of the novel itself,) is a strong dramatic arc that serves as the engine of this gigantic book. I am not going to attempt a plot summary here, suffice to say it involves an advanced tennis academy, a halfway house, one fucked up family (the Incandenzas,) and a plot by wheelchair-bound assassins to destroy the world using the ""Entertainment,"" an irresistible movie created by the father of the aforementioned family, which forces the viewer to continue watching until they die. But don't get lost in the plot. Wallace is an incredible writer, and just reading sentence-by-sentence is a pleasure. If you know a lot of the Western Canon the book is more enjoyable, but you certainly don't have to know about Brother's Karamazov or Hamlet. Although if you do read one thing before, I would suggest Hamlet. That story is mirrored in the book in maaaaany ways, I mean, the title comes from the graveyard scene where Hamlet is holding up Yorrick's skull, ""Alas, poor Yorick! I knew him, Horatio, a fellow of infinite jest, of most excellent fancy."" And an interesting fact, the PGOAT (Prettiest Girl Of All Time) in the book, Madame Psychosis, and her relationship with Orin is based on Wallace's actual relationship with (and unhealthy obsession of,) the writer Mary Karr. Some readers have faulted the ending of the book, for not tying it up, but without spoiling it, it's actually structurally apropos, and I found it very satisfying. However, the book is not without it's shortcomings. It actually is too long, I think he could have safely lost about 100-150 pages of the Quebecois politics stuff and the book would have been better for it. That said, Infinite Jest is a masterpiece that will stand the test of time. The hype is real.

The Pale King, unfortunately not completed before his suicide, he left the manuscript along with instructions for editing in his office when he hung himself, so he certainly intended that it would be published in some form. Unfortunately not as good as Infinite Jest, and there are some jarring repetitions of phrase and scenes he almost certainly would have cut had he been around to write the thing himself. This book does get the closest to an average American experience. He was a lifelong student/scholar/outsider, and this book marked his first attempt to tackle contemporary American working life. He set the thing in an IRS center in the Midwest, and the book is, mainly, an examination of boredom. Consequently, it is, at times, boring. All in all though, if you take it for what it is, it's another solid novel. Not as structurally interesting as Infinite Jest, but that's what you get when you have an editor organizing it and not the writer. Certainly better than his first novel, but a pale shadow of his second.

"True - Buffy did it the right way; all the time Whedon was messing around with silly, cute stories in a silly, cute universe it didn't take itself seriously, and had considerable charm.  Then as the story got darker and more serious, it started taking itself more seriously (less the odd just-for-laughs episode thrown in to keep you on your toes).  The charm made you like the show, which meant you were emotionally invested in the characters when it got more serious.

The thing was, Buffy (and Angel, and Babylon 5, and Firefly, and other good sci-fi/fantasy) has *charm* - it's confident and self-deprecating, and even when it's clever it doesn't let on that it knows it.  If it was a person it would be Nathan Fillion or Neil Patrick Harris - confident and clever, but not taking themselves too seriously and never afraid to take the piss out of themselves.

Abrams' sci-fi is like the kind of self-important idiots you sometimes run into in r/science or r/conspiracy - utterly charmless people convinced of their own genius, unaware that there's anything more to the subjects they're opining on than their own shallow misapprehensions, and apparently incapable of realising they might be less than perfect, let alone capable of making a *joke* about their own fallibility or at their own expense.

If his shows were people they'd be Deepak Chopra, or Jenny McCarthy, or Ben Stein, or a small toddler that's shuffling about in his dad's shoes with a tie looped around his neck, throwing noisy tantrums when everyone refuses to talk to him like and adult and let him drive cars.

An adult doing an impression of a kid can be funny, and a kid pretending to be an adult *who knows he's pretending* is funny, but a kid who pouts and throws a tantrum and runs around kicking shins because you won't let them drink and stay out all night is just obnoxious and annoying.

Basically, *if you could adequately judge a creator from his work*, Whedon would be confident, self-deprecating, funny and very smart.  J. Michael Straczynski would be nerdy but intelligent, but Abrams would be a self-important retard who insists what he's doing is sci-fi, even while writing stories about ""m̶a̶g̶i̶c **science** flying ponies"" and ""m̶y̶t̶h̶i̶c̶a̶l **hyper quantum superstring multiverse** elves"".

The sad thing is that while his method of storytelling is a bit ""all foreplay and no fuck"", if he stopped trying to play grown-ups and stopped taking his plots and characters *so goddamn seriously* he'd actually be a much better writer. :-(","basically, *if you could adequately judge a creator from his work*, whedon would be confident, self-deprecating, funny and very smart.","funny and very","funny","but",FALSE,"funny and very smart","smart",NA,"very",1,"reddit",0.6418,"thick_non-moral_concepts_POS","positive",0.1983,NA,"thick_non-moral_concepts"

The argument was that there are two aspects to good comedy: jokes, and delivery.  You need both of these elements to be a truly funny comedian.

Dane Cook's problem is that his act is essentially all delivery.  He talks about mundane, every day things, but says it in a way that's like ""ISN'T THIS RIDICULOUS AND FUNNY?!!!""

It’s one of his lesser known works so usually people haven’t read it, but any book by Kurt Vonnegut is good - another one I liked was Cat’s Cradle.

Me Talk Pretty One Day, and When You Are Engulfed in Flames, by David Sedaris are biographical compilation of stories about his life growing up as a gay kid and man and are kind of dark but hilarious in the way he tells them. Can’t recommend him enough. He also has a lot of recorded pieces you can listen to, and the way he reads his work is amazing - so dry, so witty.

"Email.  In person, my boss is intelligent, capable and funny... but she has the *worst* email communication skills I have ever seen.  She sends everything from her iPhone and apparently punctuation is too difficult so she sends every phrase in a separate email, stream-of-consciousness style.  She doesn't include much clarification or direction, so it's difficult to figure out what she wants.  These emails might as well be haiku.  She usually doesn't return emails for hours, sometimes days, so I have to choose between plowing ahead with something that might be wrong or losing an entire day of work while I wait for her.  

Her email writing style is extremely curt and it comes off as rude, angry or dismissive (even when she's not).  She's *capable* of sitting down at a computer and composing a decent email when she's contacting a client, but when she emails employees it feels like she's giving commands to a dog.  I'm not the only employee who feels this way.

Since most of the employees (including me) work off-site and she ""doesn't have time"" for phone calls or online meetings, email communication is extremely important.  I've only been working there for a few months and I already know people who have quit over problems with email.  I was unemployed before and the job is otherwise *perfect*, so I don't want to be the next person to leave.   The stress is killing me, though.  I lose sleep and have panic attacks over these awful emails.  I feel like there's no way to approach her about the issue... apparently other people have tried, and she says they're just being ""defensive"" or ""incompetent.""

"The following were events that ""allegedly"" happened, but remain unproven. And are funny as fuck. 

Someone resembling myself, was in a fraternity in college. Pranking was par for the course. However, it should be said, we were quite good at pranking. Usually it wasn't malicious; more so simply creative and funny. But this one time, a rival fraternity took it a little to far with us, so we were forced to whip out a trump card prank, (allegedly)....this is what what went down.

We had security cameras outside of our fraternity house. Right after school let out around the beginning of June, a rival fraternity stole our letters. And they took a shit in the drivers seat of my personal vehicle. There would be hell to pay. 

We threw a party that weekend and padlocked out bathroom doors shut. All peeing and shitting via all patrons, was to be done into plastic five gallon buckets in plywood ""stalls"" we built on several porches of our triple decker. We capped 16 buckets of fucking awful, &amp; let these ferment for like a week and a half in unrelenting 90 degree heat. 

One of our brother's fathers owns a pyrotechnics company that sets off 90% of the fireworks in the Northeast U.S.....so we got some of his equipment, some detonation wires, a detonator, and 16 quarter sticks of dynamite.

That Sunday night, 4 in the morning, we take 2 rented, nondescript vans and take the seats out from them, load 16 buckets of fermented shit &amp; piss into them with 10 of my fraternity brothers. Each of these buckets is capped, with a hole drilled in the top. Inside each bucket is a quarter stick, wired up to some det wire, wired up to a panel detonator (one where you just hit a single switch and it will set off multiple charges simultaneously). 

We rolled up to their house just prior to the asscrack of dawn, cardboard over the licence plates, ski masks,  all black gear, and unloaded the buckets onto their lawn and had one brother go try and pick the lock. The douche bags LEFT THE DOOR OPEN. So everyone took one or two buckets a piece and ran into the house, and put at least one in every room on the ground floor. After this was done (which took all of 10 seconds, as we had lined up the buckets in the order they were wired on the lawn prior to making our entry and just kind of circled them around the ground floor.....) We went outside and emptied the gas out of an airhorn. The lights go on. We wait five seconds or so, till we hear the first, ""What the fuck...""

BANG! Every window on the ground floor of the house blows out. And everything is coated in a fine mist of fermented fecal matter, piss and wet nasty TP. We see a lone brother of theirs, stagger out the door, and fall to his knees screaming, ""I can't hear, what happened....FUCK!"" Covered head to toe in shitspray so dank he had changed races. We peeled out laughing our asses off. Shit in my car? Fuck all y'all. Not. Even. Sorry.

"I fear I'll never find my favorite kind of game again. When I was younger, I absolutely loved games like **Runescape and Mabinogi** because they had the most living worlds I could find. The trick with games that encourage exploration is that they rarely leave any reason to return to the places you've already been. Everything is packaged up nice and neatly into zones that are level-bound, and once you're past that level range, being there is just a waste of time.

For all the crap they get, RS and Mabi definitely did something right in terms of never making you feel like you've ""completed"" an area. There's always more quests left (Maybe small in scale or reward, but never meaningless.) and NPCs were non-player *characters* rather than living mailboxes for quest requests. One of the things that I, to this day, consider to be one of the best design choices *in gaming* is the right-click menu in Runescape. Everything has two shared options - use and examine. Every item has flavor text, but you have to make a conscious, in-character decision to look at it and see what you can glean from the item. Sometimes it's a funny but pointless bit of humor, sometimes it's insight into the world, and sometimes it's a subtle hint. Combine that with the ability to ""use"" any item on any other item and suddenly everything is covered in possibility. 99% of the time when you use two random items together, they do nothing. That makes sense. But it's figuring out that you can just combine two half doses of a potion into the same vial that makes it interesting. It's your axe head breaking off, then fixing it by reattaching the head to the handle. It's using a tinderbox with some logs to start a fire, then trying to cook something you found on it, or picking up the ashes to chalk your hands before your character goes to try shotput. *Nothing* feels like there's only one possible use. Things simply are what they are.

As the obsession with huge open worlds has continued, large worlds became a tick-box rather than a style of game. They're thrown in the game as features like a leveling system in a game that doesn't need one. They're marketing before they're game features. Combine that with the advent of procedurally-generated crap, towns and dungeons become something disturbingly similar to a ""Find your elf name!"" chart you'd see on facebook. You get a seed (Your name/birthday) and a finite amount of equally dull responses, are entertained for a moment, then move on.

One of the reasons I enjoyed the original **Dark Souls** was that it had a lot of what I wanted. The two closest areas to Firelink shrine are super-lategame areas, for example. There's a character in the game who has a story about his own meaninglessness *who still has more fucking meaning that 99% of the characters in modern gaming.* Few/none of the weapons are completely useless unless their very purpose is to be useless. The game isn't afraid of you missing Ash Lake, and never tells you about Shiva's craziness. The witch's ring's only purpose could only be figured out through coincidence (or incredibly sharp lore-sense) and even then, it's only a story usage. That story usage, though, is *intensely* cool and memorable. Hell, there's even the pendant. It's completely and utterly useless in every way known to gaming, but its very existence spawned so many stories and experiences.

**Stardew Valley** was a breath of fresh air. It embodied a lot of what I liked about games in this style; combat is a part of life, not the point of life. Areas don't freeze in time when you're gone, people aren't a checklist of objectives to tick off, and progression is solely based on what kind of things you like to do with your time. I thought **Black Desert** might be able to deliver that kind of experience, but similarly to **Archeage**, I was left disappointed.

So, is there anybody out there with similar taste in games that could throw me a bone? Something I could really throw myself at. Characters that would leave me upset when I finally run through all of their quests and character arc the way you get attached to Zanik while trying to sort out all the messes cave goblins get in to; quests that are less hired thug, more person in the right place at the right time. A player character that isn't defined by how they beat the crap out of things, and a world that doesn't feel like it fades away when you aren't looking, like that one episode of Rick and Morty with the simulation.

**Long story short, I want a game that role playing game where you play a role, characters have character, quests that involve being a person more than a thug, and where the first settlers in a city don't decide to limit their problems to level 10 and under.**

"Even with your edits I don't think it's appropriate to label the postdocs' behavior as misogyny, since it could merely be a cultural misunderstanding or communication issue.

"* **Kamichu** - A middle school girl wakes up one morning and realizes that she is a goddess.  A funny, sweet series, and it compares quite favorably to Miyazaki.

* **Midori Days** - A reluctant juvenile delinquent wakes up one day and discovers he has a small girl attached to his arm, puppet-like, where his hand used to be.  Yeppers, you read that right.  A very funny and sometimes emotional show.  

* **Haré+Guu** - (The Japanese title is a complicated pun).  The Green Acres of anime.  A young boy living in a tropical paradise with his dingy mother get's a new younger ""sister"" named Guu.  Strange, disturbing, and extremely funny.  

* **Potemayo** - A boy discovers a small human/cat like creature living in his refrigerator between the potato salad and the mayonnaise.  Very strange cuteness occurs. 

* **Love Com** - A romantic comedy about a short boy and a tall girl.  Very sweet show with lots of wackiness. Half the fun is watching all the mugging and funny faces that Risa, the girl, makes.

* **Moyashimon** - A college comedy about a guy who can see microbes; which comes in pretty handy if the college you are going to is an agriculture school.  

* **Nanaka 6-17** - Nanaka is a serious girl high school student. Too serious according to her childhood friend.  Then one day Nanaka develops a brain disorder that causes amnesia such that she thinks she's 6 years old again.  Mostly light comedy with some equally light drama. Very likable characters.

* **NieA Under 7** - Probably the darkest of the shows listed here, but not very dark.  Set in near future Japan about 20 years after a large UFO crashed and stranded it's inhabitants. The aliens look like us except they have slightly pointy ears and some have antenna sticking out of their heads.  The show is part slice of life, part allegory about immigrants.   Think _District Nine_ but with likable characters and none of the political drama.  One of my all time favorite anime series.  The musical score, which is particularly distinctive, can only be described as Hawaiian UFO music.

* **Sketchbook Full Colors** - Slice of life show with almost no plot what-so-ever.  About a shy, quite girl who joins the school art club.  Not much ever happens in the show, and that's okay.  Watch an episode or two a week. Or a month.  Great animation and funny non-stories.  

* **Soredemo Machi wa Mawatteru** - The antidote to _Sketchbook_. Funny, raucous, and strangely thoughtful. A ditzy high school girl who wants to be a detective goes to work in a run down cafe, in a run down shopping arcade, that is trying to drum up some business by having the waitresses cosplay as maids. The head maid is in her 80s.  Stylish SHAFT animation and great vocal performances.  The OP animation is one of the wonders of the modern world.

* **Windy Tales** - Funny, but thoughtful show about a girl and her friends that become involved with a small village of ""wind tamers"".  The art style is very different, and excellent.  Another series to watch slowly over time.

"Interestingly enough, this all went down in PA, which is where I am originally from (Pittsburgh area)

Back then, things were different (early 80's).  I think she was wrong in hindsight, but I am not opposed to corporal punishment at all.  People should stop being such pussies with their kids and crack em once and a while.  It's been done since the dawn of time as a way for parents to manage their kids.

Funny but true story of when I was ""arrested"" in 7th grade for lighting a trash barrel on fire in the recess yard:

I was near the smokers and the trash bin when a teacher came out during recess.  They all threw their cigs into the trash and moved away.  I was about 5 feet away with 2 other kids and didn't notice the thing turning to smoke and fire behind us as the teacher walked toward us.  We were busted for causing the fire, even though none of us had anything to do with it.

They called the cops who took us to the station (to teach us a lesson I guess).  I was terrified.  They couldn't reach my father, and were trying to reach my mother.  I remember crying and begging the officer not to call my mom, just keep trying for my dad.  I mean, I was freaked out as I knew what was in store.  

At one point he asked me why I was so afraid of my mother.  I told him whole heartedly I thought she would kill me the second she sees me if she found out.  He looked at me in good humor said, do you think with all of these officers around here that we would let your mother kill you?

I distinctly remember looking around the room and telling him ""You don't have enough.""

I meant it.

They put me in a holding cell, called my mother anyways.  OMG, I was terrified.

When they released me to her she drug me by my hand out of the building and started laughing and laughing.  I kept telling her I didn't light thing on fire it was the other kids, but she kept laughing.  I was told to go to my room, and nothing happened.

Years later my mother recounted this story to me from her side.  She said that when the officer called her and said why I was at the police station, he concluded with ""Lady, what is your secret?  Your son is absolutely convinced you will kill him and our entire police force won't be enough to stop you.""

This apparently amused her greatly and thus I got out of a whooping.","funny but true story of when i was ""arrested"" in 7th grade for lighting a trash barrel on fire in the recess yard:  i was near the smokers and the trash bin when a teacher came out during recess.","funny but true","funny","but",FALSE,"funny but true","true",NA,NA,1,"reddit",0.26806,"thick_non-moral_concepts_POS","positive",NA,NA,"thick_non-moral_concepts"

"As a big RE fan since the 90s, I bought it day one. It was one of the biggest disappointment in my life as a gamer. RE5 was flawed but funny, especially in coop. It was ""new"", over the top. My main problem with RE6 is Chris' lame campaign. Leon's is alright, Sherry is cute, I was glad to see her again, because one of my favorite aspect of the series is the ""precise"" timeline. But man... Chris' campaign is terrible. Piers is terrible. Worse, I was expecting so much from Ada's campaign. But it went only meh in the end...

Don't misunderstand me, the game is ambitious, generous, but it's so, so far from what RE meant originally... I really think they could have named it something else. I'm sure Capcom realised something was wrong, because even though it sold well *(a little less than RE 5)* they went back to real stuff with RE 7, which I really, really enjoyed on PSVR. Like really enjoyed. *Maybe one of my most memorable experience as a gamer*. So yeah, they did the right thing, imo. 4 players boss fights are not RE. Dead Space 3 was released right after and made me feel almost the same. Really disappointed, almost jaded.

"Yes... Masturbation seems to be the only way to do things for me. Luckily, I have rather low sex drive, I can go for days without thinking about it so...

I started with DS2 first, then DS1, so I've gotta say that DS2 has got a large impact on me? The maps linkage is kinda wonky though... Other than that, I think it works just right for me. (Fun fact: During my first run through I was cautious as can be, killed every foe till they no longer respawn, take all the souls to level up... Then I lost 36k soul by dying twice... - This was before I know about Giant Lord + Bonfire Ascetic exploit. So, dumb me restarted after hours of grinding.)

I don't remember Artorias, actually, I didn't finish the first game... I kinda lost interest halfway through. Catarina Knight looks so freaking huggable.

I think lean bodies, be it male or female is good looking. But when the bulk comes in... I... Get a little... uncomfortable? Especially on females. Those who cheat have their 'reasons', but in an evolutionary perspective they are more 'successful' in spreading their genes. Although humans have evolved to care for our young in order to ensure that the new specimen can become of service to the community, so... sex hoppers would eventually be weeded out? I sure hope so.

The girls that I grow up around really do scare me quite a bit, more so than the guys. The guys merely disgusted me, the girls... they are quite the enigma to me. One of my 'goals' as a trans is to show that I be a model woman? Like... I don't know, be the independent, rational and modest type? I think females are brought up with the idea that they may try to succeed in life, but if all else fails, you can always get married..? I wouldn't wanna go down that rabbit hole, it could evoke sexism and I wanna stay as neutral as possible. After all, I dislike all humans.

Perhaps it just comes naturally to me, when online, I tend to give off that vibe too, my gender comes off as ambiguous, leaning toward the feminine side.

I've seen 'successful' transgenders on YouTube and some... not-so-successful ones on the streets. I hope those not-so-successful ones are still undergoing the change, cocoon stages are usually unpleasant.

I'm thinking of earning my own money before I take actions, sure, I do have savings with me now but... gotta keep them as reserves, who knows when I'd need them as emergency money. Gotta get my psychiatrist to give me the green light before I can proceed, but damn it, I'm hesitant as heck.

I did try to courteously break the illusions of religions in general whenever I'm in the presence of religious people. It doesn't seem to work... So I've watched/read up on why religious people are so stubborn with their POV, apparently, being subjected to religious doctrines as a kid has that effect on you. The truths told during those years become cemented and usually it's hard to break away from. Although a religious classmate of mine says that sometimes he doubt his own faith, feels bad about it, tries to be logical, but can't seem to put down faith... At least he's questioning. Then there's this other fellow I know, who is a half-believer, he goes to church, believes in afterlife but is pretty laid back and open to discussions.

I always imagined this scenario where ancient humans were camping in the caves one night, suddenly a storm brewed. One of the men went out to take a look at the rain, he turns around and raises his arms, just then, a bolt of lightning flashes through the skies. He shouted something, everyone else couldn't hear him over the voice of the roaring thunder, so they assumed that he just 'summoned' lightning. This supernatural coincidence made caught them in awe, this is when that man realized... 'I could use this to my advantage'. Tada, my hypothetical origin on how 'deities' come to be.

I always think that prayers are a lazy way to 'help' someone.

Oh yeah, there's this quote that I found pretty funny but true - ""when one person suffers from a delusion it is called insanity. When many people suffer from a delusion it is called religion."".

It's all about a common consensus that becomes mutually verified and gradually solidified.

"People are already proposing ammunition taxes and trying to gut the 2nd any chance they get- it's clearly treated as a 2nd class right by half this country (the other half unfortunately treats \*all the other rights\* as 2nd class rights though, which is funny but tragic).

My personal problem is that there's already too many people who want \*less\* guns in society. There isn't really a way to get there other than 2 options: 

1. Restrict the right of the 2nd Amendment or physically take their guns away.
2. Make America so safe that nobody will feel the need to own a handgun for protection

being

-I wish they had revealed it at THIS e3 instead of the last, and made a beta for dedicated players to test until release. 

-like many said there's not a lot of reason for multiplayer as it doesn't add a whole lot to the game. A couple things are easier with a group, like events, but still doable solo. 

- I'd be okay with a shortage of NPCs if they're leading up to you actually finding a settlement or just something.

-still see a lot of bugs while I play, whether it be graphical or just straight up ""wtf"" moments.

-the AI seems kinda dumb. In one event at the airport the mobs spawned at the top of a cliff and just sorta..jumped off and died trying to get to us.  I found it really funny but also annoying, an entire wave of enemies spawn in the same spot for you to mow down, but subsequently fall to they're doom and neglecting to give me exp or loot for it.

-even with all the randoms running around the game feels empty and lonely. 

- they should have released a better more polished version this year or next year. I would have waited or even paid something like 15$ to get access to a beta for testing, especially if that initial cost would get you a discount on the final product or something.","i found it really funny but also annoying, an entire wave of enemies spawn in the same spot for you to mow down, but subsequently fall to they're doom and neglecting to give me exp or loot for it.  -even with all the randoms running around the game feels empty and lonely.   - they should have released a better more polished version this year or next year.","funny but also","funny","but",FALSE,"really funny but also annoying","annoying","really","also",1,"reddit",-0.53363,"thick_non-moral_concepts_POS","positive",NA,NA,"thick_non-moral_concepts"

"Completely re-edited version of previously useless list of just titles (14hrs after originally posted) with brief descriptions of each podcast added (these are in no particular order):

* 
**In Our Time** - In-depth discussion of a different topic each week (from Arts, Science, History, Philosophy) with 3 expert academics in the subject and the cantankerous Melvyn Bragg bullying them to talk sense.

* 
**Answer Me This** - Listeners' questions on any topic at all (several q's per show) answered by Helen and Ollie with engaging wit. You could look most of the questions up on Google, but this is much more entertaining.

* 
**Adam and Joe** - Great humor and interaction between these two British broadcasting legends that is simultaneously both subtle and silly. This would be my pick for the absolute best of British humor and possibly my favorite podcast of all, but unfortunately they're on hiatus at the moment. Due back within a couple of months though they say, and back episodes are available.

* 
**Skeptics' Guide to the Universe** - Panel of skeptics headed by Steven Novella look at science and pseudoscience stories in the news with humor. Informative and often funny, but can verge towards being a little 'preachy' at times.

* 
**The Sporkful** - Short food podcast for 'eaters, not foodies'. In-depth discussion of issues such as the best buffet strategy, what toppings a pizza should have, and how to eat a bagel.

* 
**Philosophy Bites** - Short (~20min) podcast on a topic from philosophy.

* 
**History of Philosophy** - Similar to Philosophy Bites, but as the name suggests, on a historical philosopher or topic.

* 
**The Cultural Gabfest** - Intelligent discussion about and reviews of latest movies, books, tv etc.

* 
**The Ethicist** - Two ethical queries sent in by readers answered in this very short podcast (5min) by Randy Cohen each week, e.g. things like 'My professor said he'd give me a higher grade if I help out after class'.

* 
**The Infinite Monkey Cage** - Witty science and comedy chat with Prof Brian Cox, Robin Ince and guests and audience.

* 
**The Dave Gorman Podcast** - Humorous chat with Dave, Danielle and Martin. Half the podcast is the chat from the live weekly radio show, and the other half podcast-only material including listener's submissions of real-life businesses for Pun Street.

* 
**Savage Love Podcast** - No-holds-barred sex advice for listeners' problems from the open-minded and highly entertaining Dan Savage.

* 
**The Perfect Ten** - Phil and Phil answer 10 listeners' questions in their inimitably funny way. Definitely adult-only comedy.

* 
**Frank Skinner on Absolute Radio** - Highlights of Frank's radio show with Emily and Gareth; often sparkling wit from one of Britain's top funny men.

* 
**The Moth Podcast** - People telling real stories from their lives on stage; can be compelling, funny, sad, bizarre, unsettling - depending upon the story and storyteller.

* 
**Buzz Out Loud** - Daily tech news from Molly Wood and the gang.

* 
**Stuff You Should Know** - Chuck and Josh give you the lowdown on a different topic each week in their easy-going and likeable yet informative style.

* 
**Stuff You Missed In History Class**, **Stuff to Blow Your Mind** - Also from the SYSK stable, 2 podcasts covering history and 'mind-blowing ideas'. Presenters not quite as engaging as Chuck and Josh, but good informative content.

* 
**Wiretap** - Surreal slices from the comedy life of Jonathan Goldstein.

* 
**Friday Night Comedy** - Weekly topical comedy from the BBC. Alternates between the brilliant News Quiz (panel comedy news game) and the not quite so funny Now Show (sketch show based on the week's news).

* 
**Material World** - Latest developments in science with the astoundingly enthusiastic Quentin Cooper interviewing the actual scientists and other people involved.

* 
**Great Lives** - Biography series: A celebrity chooses someone who's no longer with us as their great life, and discusses why with an expert on the person they've chosen and host Matthew Parris. Often fascinating alternate views even of people you thought you knew all about.

* 
**The Front Row Podcast** - Latest in the world of movies, plays, books, and culture with intelligent interviews with the directors, stars and authors by the incisive Matthew Lawson, who caused Russell Crowe to storm out in anger last year.

"I decided to have some fun this time and rank order the shows from favorite to least favorite! 

**Wake Up Girls**

This was one of my surprises for the season. I'm not one of those who think that Yamakan is a talentless hack, but I wasn't expecting him to redeem himself on an idol anime, of all things. He says he hates moe, but ironically I think that's what he's best at. Oh poor cursed Yamakan!

This isn't to say the show didn't have it's weaknesses. The fundamental premise seemed to be about making a more realistic idol show, but this seemed quite frequently forgotten for the sake of an easy resolution to problems or even just a comedy moment. The comedy was pretty mediocre, and whatever value it had in lightening the mood was lost by the fact that it made the show seem schizophrenic and even a bit stupid. The only time this show realized its true potential was in the first episode (the movie version). It was a bunch of normal girls joining a dysfunctional agency on the verge of bankruptcy for a chance at maybe getting a glimpse of their dream, and it was pretty grim and sobering. This was followed by another episode about them being exploited at seedy venues just because they were that desperate, and it seemed like the show was going to be amazing, but then the problem got resolved in a tidy and comedic way, and the show lost any pretense of wading more than ankle deep into the subject. 

As the show carried on, it became more about the girls and less about the business, and I have to say that the character depth *far* surpassed any other idol shows I've seen. I inevitably find these type of idol shows super addicting. I don't really like idol groups too much; the whole ""cute"" factor seems to pervade both the music and the choreography to the point where everything seems glossy and fake, but there's something in the shows that I can relate to. I guess really that anyone who's been on a stage can relate to. And that's probably why I get more excited at that moment right before they start performing than in the best shounen action sequences. 

**Inari, Konokon, Koi Iroha**

This show is another one of the surprise gems of the winter anime season, a diamond in the rough that most of you guys didn't notice. It's just a simple show about the trials and tribulations of a schoolgirl, combined with a dose of magic. The only thing that makes this show great is how utterly devoid of bullshit it is, and how utterly filled with life it is instead. Sure, our protagonist is given magical powers, but she quickly finds out that they are worse than useless if she can't muster up the courage it'd take to achieve her goals without magic even helping her. It's a sweet romantic drama, with no otaku stereotypes, very limited fanservice, and only authentic character interactions. Sadly, this also means that it's probably going to be a commercial failure.

**Nourin**

More proof that the better shows flew under the radar, IMO. Silver Link productions always get the short end of the stick, so I'm not surprised this was less popular than most of the lower-ranked shows on my list. And just like the shows ranked above this one, it also goes for the ""no bullshit"" angle quite frequently. 

One moment in this show really impressed me: the showdown between a student and his father, where the student was preaching all these organic principles, yet he lost the showdown because his food couldn't sell as well. It was a bit of a surprise because the show had seemed pro-organic up until this point, and indeed, most comparisons between foods favored the organic product. Yet at the end of the day, the customers preferred the father's ""scientific"" product that had been treated with fertilizers, sprayed with insecticides, and whatnot. 

I also liked the love triangle. This is coming from a love triangle hater. I liked this one because one of the girls was very clearly less attractive than the other one, forcing her to overcompensate and thus giving the love triangle a much more unique dynamic than most. The ending of this show surprisingly brought back memories of Macross, [where our protagonist wasn't just choosing between two girls, he was really choosing between two ways of life](/spoiler). The last scene was my favorite though, ""a bird can't fly with one wing"" indeed, you perv!  If only I could come up with such memorable sayings to justify my selfishness!

**Engaged to the Unidentified**

Is it just me, or are of my favorite shows the ones that nobody was really talking about? [According to this /r/anime survey](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/20uwqi/ranime_winter_2014_what_are_you_watching_top/), none of my top 3 choices were in the top 10 most watched shows this season. Well, we can add this show to the list of personal top choices that didn't make the top 10. This show was a superbly well-balanced romantic comedy executed with full confidence and none of the typical traps. ~~As a huge SHAFT fan, I have to say that this puts Nisekoi to shame.~~ Originality can't beat quality after all!

Of all the shows, I think this is the one I most want a second season of. 

**Kill La Kill**

So, it was basically another version of the ""make it as super and crazy as possible"" game. I don't know why they're still playing, TTGL won pretty conclusively at that game several years ago! Honestly, I was never a fan of this animation style (my apologies to all the Hiroyuki fans out there), and I feel like this is the anime that pretty conclusively shows the limitations of the style. Once you stretch things too far, they lose meaning, right? You don't even question the fact that they're yelling at each other in outer space, because it's been established that anything goes. But where goes the suspense? Kill someone, and you have no way of knowing if they really died or not, because normal indicators of death are meaningless in this style. This was Miyazaki's nightmare when he warned about ""excessive expressionism"" in anime. 

Oh, and the fanservice? No, fuck you guys, I'll be the person that complains about something *else*, thank you very much! Even if Trigger seemed a bit reluctant, they did make an earnest gesture towards including provocative shots of naked male bodies, and they did have a real point behind all that, even if it wasn't a very great point and served just as much as an excuse for perverted animators to have their fun. I honestly find that we're way too damn critical of sexuality anyways, but I've already had that rant and I'll save the rehash for another day. 

**Sekai Seifuku**

When the series turned dark, I just had one thought: ""please, don't let this show cop out with silly nonsense!"" Not that I mind catharsis, mind you, but even that can be overdone, turning too many anime finales into a whiplash from dungeons to rainbows. Unfortunately, that's basically what happened. Rather than something with actual meaning, we got the usual ""laugh and be happy"" combined with some half-assed attempts at philosophical messages. 

This show was *okay*. I can see why people were excited over it, but in the end the series felt like little more than a wisecrack. The intro was never justified (perhaps signaling an intent for a season 2? Well, they'd better deliver now!), and none of the characters or themes were really fleshed out. It was funny, but ultimately shallow.

**The Pilot's Love Song**

The amusing forum reactions to the destruction of Isla really revealed a big flaw in the show; it doesn't put nearly enough effort into explaining shit. According to people who've read the novels, [Isla began picking up speed as it approached the end of the sky, eventually reaching the point where it was uncontrollable and everyone had to bail out](/spoiler). Wow, isn't that kind of… a really crucial plot point? I did like the ending though, quickly snuffing out a potential love triangle instead of making the usual drama out of it (I even found Ari to be more attractive and interesting than Claire, but I'd rather leave her with a bittersweet farewell than go through tons of cliche drama just for a happy ending), and I actually felt like this was a perfectly fine open ending (IMO that sense of ""new beginning"" is crucial to a good open ending)

I'd say that overall this show was somewhat inconsistent, with both clear hits and misses. Death flags were way too obvious, the battle scenes were sadly unrealistic, that whole ""little brother"" ""little sister"" thing was totally stupid and annoying, yet still the whole affair had a bit of earnest charm that I couldn't ignore.

"When I was that age (~15 years ago), I discovered the comics of Nick Knatterton in my parent's library, which was actually a stuffed room in the basement.

It's a german comic from the fifties. It's [english Wikipedia page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Knatterton) sadly doesn't have as much content as the [german one](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Knatterton). 

Anyway, Nick Knatterton is a private detective and his mental capabilites are pretty awesome. Sherlock Holmes seems to have been a model for this character, but the stories are funny, but still serious, if I remember it correctly. The wikipedia article says that the humour is mostly derived from the political stuff going on in the fifties, but it was still funny for me as a kid and I didn't care much about politics back then.

[This page](http://www.karikatur-museum.de/Nick-Knatterton.html) has a few pictures of the comic as examples.","sherlock holmes seems to have been a model for this character, but the stories are funny, but still serious, if i remember it correctly.","funny, but still","funny","but",TRUE,"funny , but still serious","serious",NA,"still",1,"reddit",0.27333,"thick_non-moral_concepts_POS","positive",-0.27675,NA,"thick_non-moral_concepts"

"That last phrase is very well put. I grew up in the military and having done so never signed up.

"Pedobear has the type of face you just want to trust, but underneath those saucer-like black eyes and cheerful smile, there is a much darker side. Though is appearance is that of a cute stuffed animal, his name tells you there is something deeper in there. Something more sinister, and that is indeed the truth.

The appeal of Pedobear is not a huge mystery. On the internet, where cute images and obscenities mix and mingle, he works as a mixture of both to appeal to both the sinister and the less than deviant corners of the internet -- this is what makes him so universally recognized and accepted. Anyone can understand the humor in Pedobear, as long as they do not take him seriously.

Casual web users and internet addicts alike can find solace in his cute face, while getting a nice chuckle out of the fact that he is indeed not what he seems. This is not an effect that many people are fully aware of, but in fact if Pedobear were somehow less cute and more menacing, he would likely not be anywhere near as popular; he definitely would not have lasted from 2004 to today. No -- Pedobear is and always has been so popular because of his looks. The jokes are funny, but the well-tuned mix between naughty and nice is what makes him shine.

Pedobear's mixture of appeals is what makes him stand out from the hundreds of other memes. Some internet communities may know of some memes while others have their own, but Pedobear has found his way into nearly all of the facets of the internet. In some cases, some of which by clever individuals with Photoshop, he has even made his way into the real world.

Another thing that makes him so popular is the controversy surrounding his love of little girls. The vast majority of people do not advocate this type of behavior, and some of which do not see the black humor in Pedobear. This has caused some trouble in the past, and is likely to again. The internet, with its vast trolls and lovers of inside jokes, is often overjoyed at someone's misunderstanding of the Pedobear meme, especially if it makes it into the media. His mentions in the media are also a contribution to his popularity, as awareness grows from people who had never heard of him before. He is one of the few memes to actually make it outside of our computer screens and into the newspapers.

Though not for the easily offended or simply easily confused, Pedobear does have a solid place in internet culture as what a meme should be. Though he obviously does not come up with his material on his own, hundreds and even thousands of people have put thought into different ways to make the meme funny and resilient. Black humor, a charming face, and the appreciation of hundreds of thousands of people worldwide are what have ultimately led to his continuous popularity. With no relation to politics, race, or social issues Pedobear falls into a category that makes it difficult to actually ""get old"". This may actually be the biggest driving force behind his continued dominance in comparison to other, more current event-relevant internet fads and memes.

"Islam solved all of these issues long before women sacrificed becoming a mother and taking care of her home and children for the sake of chasing an unnecessary career, leaving her children in daycare if she ever has any, and waiting until she is so old to start caring more about her family than her selfish financial goals that her children reject her and drop her in a ""retirement"" home as soon as they possibly can.

Feminism is an arrogant, egocentric, systemic sabotaging of the home and of the natural relationship between a man and woman. Without the mother loving her role, the home falls apart and the children are neglected. Saying that it's justified because men mistreated women in the last 50 years is like saying that black gang violence is justified because black people were enslaved 50 years go.

Islam rejects feminism. Islam sets roles for each gender. There is no equality. Women have more rights than men in some situations, and men have more rights than women in other situations. The Qur'an clearly says ""And men have one degree (of authority) over women."" This blatantly goes against everything feminism calls for.

And if it contradicts Islam, we must reject it, no matter how much we were taught to love it.

As I said, Islam solved this problem entirely 1400+ years go, and ""feminism"" was nowhere to be found. We don't need this broken and trouble-filled belief founded and propagated by arrogant, argumentative women and silly lesbians (lol funny but true).","we don't need this broken and trouble-filled belief founded and propagated by arrogant, argumentative women and silly lesbians (lol funny but true).","funny but true","funny","but",FALSE,"funny but true","true",NA,NA,1,"reddit",0.26806,"thick_non-moral_concepts_POS","positive",NA,NA,"thick_non-moral_concepts"

Rihanna just hit me on a text
Last night I left hickeys on her neck
Wait, you just dissed me? I'm perplexed
Insult me in a line, compliment me on the next
Damn, I'm really sorry you want me to have a heart attack
Was watchin' 8 Mile on my NordicTrack
Realized I forgot to call you back
Here's that autograph for your daughter, I wrote it on a Starter cap
Stan, Stan, son
Listen, man, Dad isn't mad
But how you gonna name yourself after a damn gun
And have a man-bun?
The giant's woke, eyes open, undeniable
Supplyin' smoke, got the fire stoked
Say you got me in a scope, but you grazed me
I say one call to Interscope and you're Swayze
Your reply got the crowd yelling, ""Woo!""
So before you die let's see who can out-petty who
With your corny lines (""Slim, you're old"")—ow, Kelly, ooh

Go to sleep six feet deep, I'll give you a B for the effort

You would suck a dick to fuckin' be me for a second
Lick a ballsack to get on my channel
Give your life to be as solidified

How the fuck can him and I battle?
He'll have to fuck Kim in my flannel
I'll give him my sandals
'Cause he knows, long as I'm Shady he's gon' have to live in my shadow
Exhausting, letting off on my offspring
Lick a gun barrel, bitch, get off me!
You dance around it like a sombrero, we can all see
You're fuckin' salty
'Cause Young Gerald's balls-deep inside of Halsey
Your red sweater, your black leather
You dress better, I rap better
That a death threat or a love letter?
Little white toothpick
Thinks it's over a pic, I just don't like you, prick
Thanks for dissing me

I'm sick of your mumble rap mouth
Need to get the cock up out it
Before we can even talk about it (Talk about it)
I'm sick of your blonde hair and earrings
Just 'cause you look in the mirror and think
That you're Marshall Mathers (Marshall Mathers)
Don't mean you are, and you're not about it

"A man becomes the class clown because he so chooses, because he desires attention but lacks the patience to truly understand the kind that he wants

The way I see it, just opinion of course, is that you seem to want to rush everything you are doing. You want a loving girlfriend but you've only been on the first date with a few girls and clearly you committed too hard to those. A date is just supposed to be an outing to sort of...test the waters at first. Later it can be more romantic.

You can't expect someone to just drop into your hands like that though, it leaves people much too exposed and there are too many cruel people out there for that to even be remotely safe.

In terms of friends....you can call people and ask if they are up to something every now and again, hang out with them and talk about plans. It lets them know you are open and want to hang out. You just need to speed quality time with them, or get on their minds. It takes time to get into an established group.

I guess what I am saying is that all of these things take time and patience. It is good to be funny but important to show you can be serious as well. 

I understand your feelings though...I want deep and passionate love and I feel like relationships are often my burden, especially if they go astray. Still that's something you just need to work on, and hope that you will find the right person eventually.

"As someone who's somewhat conservative, I've the same problem.  I think I'm a pretty progressive person, well educated, and politically active, but there's no where like Reddit.  [IHateTheMedia] (http://www.IHateTheMedia.com) is a good site as is [LittleGreenFootballs] (http://www.LittleGreenFootballs.com), but they're there to respond to what many conservatives view as slanted or hypocritical media stories.  

Not that I can't blame them, especially as an NPR listener.  They've got great reporting and they're thorough, but as a Washington, DC policy attorney, I know what both sides of the story usually are, and they often times don't report both sides.  What a reporter *doesn't* say is often times more telling about their slant than what they *do* say.  After a while, I just get so frustrated that I end up listening to some Morning Zoo shit for a while just to purge myself.

Of course, the same thing applies to Reddit.  The posts here are very intelligent and really funny, but the constant attack on conservatives just gets too much.  The funny thing is that I HATE conservatives - or at least the stereotypes that most folks on Reddit lambaste, too.  Bible thumping, racist, stick-up-the-bum, don't-suck-never-mind-spit-or-swallow, evangelical, homophobic pricks/prickettes give us a bad name.  

Personally, I consider myself conservative because I don't want to see the country get in deeper debt, I believe that markets work (with minimal but affirmative government oversight), I'd rather pay les taxes than more, Presidents should negotiate from power, the ouster of Saddam was right but the way we went about it was ass-wrong, I thought John McCain would be an okay President (but an awful campaigner 8 years past expiration), and I believe in God.  

However, my conservative friends look at me askance because I thought Sarah Palin was an idiot (but probably a good lay), Obama is inspiring (but not yet ready to lead or govern effectively), W was unable to lead or govern effectively (but could be impressive in person), I'd like to see education get funded like we really mean it, and we should have a health-care plan for everyone (not like medicare, but more like the one Federal employees get).  Socially, I honestly feel that raunchy-kinky-woo-hoo sex is awesome, abortions are awful but who the hell am I to say you can't have one, and everything in the Bible is inspired by God but not everything is revealed by God.   Who, for all I know, is probably the sum of all the laws of physics who likes to touch off Big Bangs every now and then. And who doesn't give a rat's ass whether or not you touch yourself.

"&gt;what kinda of sick motherfucker doesn't like turtles?

True story here. When I was little, like 3 years old, my mom's best friends family had a pet turtle that I was completely terrified of. Of course everyone knew this, and one day when I was acting up, my moms friend suggested she use the turtle to scare me into being good. For a very long time after that when I was 'bad' they would make me take my shirt off, lay down, put the turtle on my stomach and let it crawl on me while I screamed and begged for them to take it off. They actually thought it was funny, but needless to say, I didn't.

"Put a hat down in front of your performing area, and throw some change in it to start with. That lets passers-by know your busking. A hat with change in it is the Universal Sign of the Busker! Everyone knows it!

Then, carry on with what you are doing right now with silent magic. If your choices are good, and your magic skills are decent, people will stop and watch. Magic just has that effect. 

FYI - Chinese Linking Rings has angle problems if you are not using a Locking Key Ring. People behind you will see how its done. So, if you are going to carry on doing it, either get yourself a Locking Key Ring, or be aware of where your angle problems are. 

If at all possible, if your performing area is licensed to have live music, get a Ghetto Blaster and play some loud music (Under no circumstances DO NOT USE RAP or Gangsta! Choose Middle-of-the-Road stuff. Something everyone knows. Your choice of music is actually critical - if the public don't like it, they will leave just to get away from it. Funny but true!). Turn it off once you've got a captive audience. 

If passers by don't see your magic taking place, the music will alert them that ""something"" is going on. Curiosity will get the better of them, and they will actively seek out what the music is for. 

However, sadly, as most public places no longer have licenses to have live music, you will probably have to ignore all of the above as worthless advice!

All of the above worked for me over a 10 year period performing at Covent Garden in the late '80s and early 90s. I used to make a fortune in the Summer Holidays, especially after the introduction of the Pound Coin! Before that, the largest denomination was the 50 pence piece. But once the pound coin was introduced, my earnings jumped through the roof, because everyone started throwing them in my hat (I used to use an Opera hat, as at Topper is sort-of the trade mark symbol of a magician (beside the magic wand and a white rabbit!)","funny but true!).","funny but true","funny","but",FALSE,"funny but true","true",NA,NA,1,"reddit",0.26806,"thick_non-moral_concepts_POS","positive",NA,NA,"thick_non-moral_concepts"

https://encyclopediadramatica.rs/GamerGate

To be honest though I think the description of it as a proxy war is a totally accurate one. I think it was probably one of the major proxy conflicts of the 'gender/cultural cold war' as it heats up. Differs heavily from things like Poundmetoo etc in that there was actually direct opposition, as opposed to the usual way it goes, like Russia invading the Ukraine situation where there was some mild bitching and scattered rebel fighting but no real 'war' or 'conflict' against them. Gamergate was much bigger, and probably won pretty hard by 'our side', although MSM considers it their victory. Just look how hard the advertising bux got hit.

"I have the same one, in the same stock, runs pretty good mostly. The one issue I have noticed is the USGI pinned 5/10 round Mags sometimes do a double feed or mis-feed on the 4th round. I think its whoever placed the rivet made some of them too tight to the placement for the 4th round and it gets pushed up into the feed when the 4th round is chambered. So far its only been one of my USGI mags experiencing that issue. 

The other issue is due to this AO version having the original early model safety push button, it's so close to the mag release that ocassionally (when wearing gloves, especially in winter) you end up ejecting the magazine when you take the safety off but the mag won't completely fall out until you fire the 1st round.

"How has **[raocow](http://www.youtube.com/raocow)** not been mentioned yet? I will admit his new stuff isn't as amazing as his old, but when he was on form, it was multiple crowning moments of funny per episode.

Other favourites are;

**[samuraikarasu](http://www.youtube.com/samuraikarasu):** Definitely one of my favourite LP'ers. Very abrasive and very funny. I'm always looking forward to new videos from him. I can't believe he's so under-appreciated too. Does older games, mostly SNES and NES games.

**[HCBailly](http://www.youtube.com/hcbailly):** Plays a lot of RPGs, mostly final fantasy and Dragon quest/warrior. Good for filling in the blanks for the games in the series you may not have played. If you wanna see a quality final fantasy LP, you'll most likely find it on his channel. More cheese than funny, but still enjoyable.

**[quill18](http://www.youtube.com/quill18):** Does mostly strategy games, but also some others. I only really watch the strategy ones, they're very informative and it's obvious he really cares about the games he plays.

**[biborkiraly](http://www.youtube.com/biborkiraly):** Only does Civilization V playthroughs. Very knowledgeable and goes into a lot of detail. Being funny isn't the focus, but he's still funny at times.

**[Yogscast](http://www.youtube.com/bluexephos):** Minecraft LP's are way overplayed nowawadays, but these guys still make them fun.

"I went through the same thing there. They laughed at me. ""You're on acid, go do acid things"" They were still fucked up from the day drinking. I didn't trust them. I ran back to my apartment. By the time I got there, I had forgotten my hand had hurt and was more concerned about my beating heart. I think my hearts gonna explode. I might die of exhaustion. Am I thirsty? ""Water!"" I panted, collapsing on the ground. My friends look up from the TV, ""Are you alright man?"" ""I'm dehydrated, I need water."" Sober friend says ""Here, I'll go to 711 and get you water."" I throw him my wallet too distressed to deal with it. 

He's gone and 30 seconds later, I'm pacing. Where is he? This is how people die on LSD, dehydration. OH. WHAT AM I DOING. Water comes out of the faucet duh. I spend 5 minutes looking for a clean cup. ""Dude, just use your hands"". Duh. I'm drinking water faster than ever before, when OH NO. This is how people die on LSD. Drinking too much water. I stop and and I sit very still. I wake up my roommate 

""John! John! are you sober?!"" 

*grunt* ""What? Aren't you on acid right now""

""John I hurt myself. Can you check me out?""

""Dude. Acid."" He puts on a CLEARLY fake smile and starts making childrens noises and jumping around. I know he's faking it. But I feel better. 

""John, I think I hurt myself. I might have to go to the hospital""

""WOOO!! WOO!! ACIDDD YEAHH!! Let's listen to some Ronald Jenkees and dance"" still in a I-just-woke-up-and-out-of-it stage. 

My friend comes back with the water and I forget all about it. Im tired. What am I doing. ""Guys, I'm going to sleep. I'll seeya tomorrow"" They look unphased. I undress into my boxers and get into bed. Bed feels weird. Wet. I get a text message, ""Yo, what're you up to right now?"" I send one back ""Tired and confusded"". Of course, my friend rushes over to check on me. By the time he had gotten there, I was convinced I was stuck forever. My heart was beating so loudly that the cops were gonna come. I imagined the cops busting through my door and arresting me for being too loud. My parents would see me tripping on LSD. My parents. They can help me here. I dial in my Mom's number. I hesistate. Wait. I should not call my mom on acid. But I love my mom and my dad. They would understand. I can do anything and they would still love me. My rational mind kick it. I run outside my room in my boxers and throw my phone across the room. ""KEEP THAT AWAY FROM ME! Only bad things can happen if I use that"". John had invited two girls over and three guys were there too. I looked at them kind of laughing at me. I didn't care. 

I went back to sleep. Nope. No sleep. I'm gonna shower. I get out of bed, get naked in the bathroom and feel the hot shower on me. It feels funny but refreshing. I step out of the shower, dry off. I open my eyes. Im in bed. Naked. Completely dry. What? I realized I had only imagined going in the shower and my mind had literally reenacted every sense necessary for me to believe I took a shower. I felt and saw everything while lying in my bed dreaming. What was going on? I went outside, and beckoned my sober friend out onto our balcony.

""Dude. After this acid trip, I'm never doing acid again. I'm throwing it all away, I don't want it""

He laughs. Unfortunately he's a very sarcastic person. ""Really? You're gonna throw it all away huh?""

""Yep. I'm done with this. I almost called my mom. Kyle. I think I'm gonna kill myself."" I peered over the edge of the balcony

He laughs again, ""Are you being serious dude?"" 

""Whats the point of living man?""

He stammers for a second. He looks inside as if for reinforcement. ""There's a lot to live for. You wanna smoke a cigarette?""

""Sure""

""My lighters inside, help me find it""

I go inside and forget that whole conversation happened for the mean time. I go back to my room, go in the bathroom and start to puke into the toilet. The most awkward strange feeling ever. I don't know why I'm puking. I feel like I'm dying. I finish puking and go back outside to the living room where my friends are watching a Star Wars marathon laughing at all the unfunny parts. I think they're laughing because they're having as bad of a time as I am and they're laughing to keep their mind from leading them down a bad trip. I start to laugh too. Not because anythings funny, but... just because. The movie ends, and my friends decide to leave except for one of them. He hangs out, the others leave. Right when the others leave we start to come down from the peak, roughly 6-7 hours after we had taken it. A 6-7 hour peak on acid.

We start to listen to music and my other roommate comes home on a bunch of MDMA. We start listening to music and dancing and singing and life is good. I go to my other LSD trip buddy's place and we play beerpong. I learn a lot about myself. We run into a bunch of friends on molly and we start giving each other light shows and massages and we meet new people. Life is good. But the experienced has scarred me.

I may never to LSD again. The thought of it scares me. But I want to.

"I'd love to follow you with a camera, because I have a guess that some of the the ""scary black dudes"" are people who I would say ""hi"" to, maybe exchange a few polite words, and then sit on the bench beside.

[edit] I want to expand on why I am reacting to Kdubya's comments this way (not that I think this will reduce the downmods--I suspect the opposite--but because I don't want to be perceived as making an unfair judgment or being an advocate of political correctness). I see many people these days using ""rebellion"" against political correctness as a convenient cover for *actual* racism. These people are paranoid and overreact to the actions of a minority to strengthen their opinions. 

A great example is the ""I wish I could say 'white' or 'black,' but we are so politically correct we can't say it anymore."" This is bullshit. I say white and black frequently, and avoid annoying terms like ""African American"", and I've NEVER been called for it-- not by my friends (among them a multicultural advocate at my university, who is in charge of racial relations in a dorm, and my black ex-girlfriend), not by black people I've been arguing with about racial issues, and not even by whiny liberals. I'm sure there are some small group of people protesting the label ""black"", but they wield no power and are not representative. To act like you're threatened, or your freedom of speech is impaired by these people, is to be paranoid or worse, to be intentionally misrepresenting the other side.

KDubya said ""what's so scary about it? It's a white guy surrounded by scary black dudes."" For the record, I upmodded the comment, because I appreciate a blunt/crude observation as much as the next guy. I make racist jokes/comments from time to time. The difference is, I would never try and defend it as not being racist, or act like a phrase like that is not racist. How can you justify describing uniformed men with every appearance of being calm and professional as ""scary black men?"" The comment was funny, but absolutely racist.

Finally, further down the thread, he defines the new racism as ""people assuming you're racist."" What does this mean? We can look at it a lot of ways, so I'm gonna pick two-- first, let's take the black man who assumes that white people around him are thinking racist thoughts. KDubya, I am certain, would be the first to point a finger at the man and say he's racist for assuming that whites are being racist towards him-- and I would agree. So would most people, although depending on his history, we may empathize with him (it's likely most black men have encountered racism at some point in their lives.) So in this case, the paranoia itself is because of racism. 

I say it applies equally in the opposite case-- when someone like KDubya looks at a black person and assumes that the black person thinks he's racist, KDubya is being racist. It's a symptom, or perhaps a self-defense mechanism. And if he's saying things that he thinks may be deemed racist by whites, he's going to be paranoid that the liberal whites around him are considering him racist-- but if saying these things makes you uncomfortable in this way, most people would stop saying them. That he feels compelled to continue under the guise of ""fighting political correctness"" to me indicates some level of racism.

So anyway, yes, I'm making a snap judgment on little evidence, but what evidence I have all points in the same direction, namely, that kDubya is just a little bit racist. (And yes, I've seen Avenue Q-- the important point is to get him to acknowledge it instead of defending it or using as a badge of honor.)","the comment was funny, but absolutely racist.","funny, but absolutely","funny","but",TRUE,"funny , but absolutely racist","racist",NA,"absolutely",1,"reddit",-0.74158,"thick_non-moral_concepts_POS","positive",NA,NA,"thick_non-moral_concepts"

"I have a hard time believing that white people are somehow ignorant of their own stereotypes. I mean, if black people can ridicule a black stereotype by showing how ridiculous it is, then I highly doubt white people are somehow that much dumber in their ability to recognize that insulting minorities *is* a white stereotype. For instance,

&gt;That is, black male criminality is funny, but white male emasculation is not.

No, that wasn't the reason at all. Minus the possible timing of the tweet, it isn't a stereotype that a white guy can't please a girl. It is a stereotype that a black guy can please a girl more than white guys, but the latter is still the baseline. Shit, black guys are also a part of the joke about men not being able to please women in bed.

"I'm not sure where you are, but this is simply not how employment discrimination analysis works under federal, california, or new york law. There are two options: intentional discrimination or disprite impact. Intentional discrimination must be discriminatory on it's face, so a corporate document says ""X gender cannot be hired for this job"" (without a bona fide gender based reason, which is a difficult exception to fall under based on case law). Dispirited impact is an a cause of action that ends up being a battle of the experts as both sides must bring in studies showing there is either an unexplainable wage difference between genders for the same job or an unexplained unwillingness to hire a certain gender for a certain job. Neither are present here. Thus, if an attorney filed this lawsuit, the corporation could get the lawsuit thrown out with a single filed document called a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, ending the issue in a matter of days.

"&gt; To me existing means something like ""just being there"" while living is rather something like...living actively, enjoying life, doing something etc.

What is wrong with just being there? Many meditations have ""just being in the moment"" as a goal. 

&gt; The things I wrote about. The dissatisfaction of my current situation.

I will re-read the thread. 

&gt; I was not referring to extreme circumstances such as war. What I wrote was more about common situations. Actually I'm glad that I never had to experience war. 

Right. But I would think it is a same thing. You were a child and you were scared so you did not run from your mother. In fact, many women end up with boyfriends that abuse them and they never try and ran away. People are like that sometimes. 

&gt; This seems to be the best thing one can do. How far did you go; did you do something really extraordinary such as embarrassing yourself in public (thinking something like ""if I can go through this I can go through everything"") or did you face more ordinary situations?

I did nothing too outrageous that I would remember. There would be times when I would try and say something funny, and it was not funny but incredibly embarrassing. But that does not phase me anymore so it did not stick with me.

&gt; Indeed it is. That's something I realized some time ago. It's just society that wants to tell you ""you have to have many friends, you need to be popular..."" etc. Sometimes it's hard to stay true to oneself under that pressure...but it's better to have few real friends than many false ones I think.

Yes, popular society is a bit twisted because people watch TV and Movies and they implicitly assume that what they see there is the norm. Many people, for example, think that going to dance clubs is fun. It is fun for some people, but not for all. So they are at the dance club, they are not having fun so they think that they need to drink more to have fun. But for most people fun is simply having a quiet conversation with a close friend. TV does not show you people who like to have a nice conversation with couple of close friends because that would be boring to watch.

\#7 is funny but very true :)  But I really like #6...

I found #6 out by accident a few years ago.  When I get stressed, or depressed, or angry, or anything like that, the combination of going for an adventure, or even a short drive, and looking at something simpler... it tends to bring some very simple solutions to mind for, previously, very complex problems.  I've done this with animals in a pasture, waves on an ocean, or even people at a crosswalk in a busy city... it brings perspective to solve complicated problems.  It's extremely versatile... useful if you're trying to figure out how to reconcile a friendship, or solve a complex programming problem.

"What really bugs me about the selective reddit comedy circlejerk is that no credit is ever given to the Opie and Anthony Show. They had Louie on for years- way before he got his first special or series. They found out about him from other New York comics, and cultivated an eclectic guest list of hilarious talent.

These were the guys who had Patrice O Neal on at least once a month. The only reason we're lucky enough to have over a hundred hours of Patrice's comedy is because of the show. Bill Burr has also been a regular since Norton joined but like Louie is now too busy to visit all the time.

These guys gave us hundreds of hours of comedy with three great comedians; lost one to disease and the others to the business- and where is the credit? And they're still doing it! They still have on the occasional c-list comedian on who is actually conversationally funny. Not podcast-y canned snarky circlejerk funny, but real brutal NYC comedy scene funny.

I've posted about this before and others have pointed out that reddit is innately hypocritical. Everyone champions free speech and pats themselves on the back for 'fighting SRS', but when it comes to taste itself? Nope, only safe comedy like the daily show is acceptable. Reddit -as far as I can tell- has regularly rejected O&amp;A for a few reasons:

1. [Right wing] O&amp;A is politically fairly right-leaning. I'm solidly left, but I still enjoy the jokes. Redditors don't want to admit that the right can be funny. That's somehow giving them credit, or letting them win.
2. [Brutal comedy for the sake of comedy] Reddit needs a safe ""out"" with most comedy. The comedy has to be pandering milquetoast, snarky smarter-than-you self absorbed bits, or an approved comedian who can 'get away with it.'
3. [Honesty about race and controversy] Redditors think they're so edgy and sincere when they devolve into a racist circlejerk. Now the opening volley is fine- the first guy to say he hates black people is at least getting the conversation going. But the difference is that on reddit there is no opposing voice like Patrice to even things out. When it comes to race reddit has a very British condescending attitude. I mean that it isn't ""don't say nigger"" it's ""Oh don't say that dear, you'll remind them that they're niggers.""","not podcast-y canned snarky circlejerk funny, but real brutal nyc comedy scene funny.","funny, but real","funny","but",TRUE,"funny , but real","real",NA,NA,1,"reddit",0.52159,"thick_non-moral_concepts_POS","positive",NA,NA,"thick_non-moral_concepts"

"Completely re-edited version of previously useless list of just titles (14hrs after originally posted) with brief descriptions of each podcast added (these are in no particular order):

* 
**In Our Time** - In-depth discussion of a different topic each week (from Arts, Science, History, Philosophy) with 3 expert academics in the subject and the cantankerous Melvyn Bragg bullying them to talk sense.

* 
**Answer Me This** - Listeners' questions on any topic at all (several q's per show) answered by Helen and Ollie with engaging wit. You could look most of the questions up on Google, but this is much more entertaining.

* 
**Adam and Joe** - Great humor and interaction between these two British broadcasting legends that is simultaneously both subtle and silly. This would be my pick for the absolute best of British humor and possibly my favorite podcast of all, but unfortunately they're on hiatus at the moment. Due back within a couple of months though they say, and back episodes are available.

* 
**Skeptics' Guide to the Universe** - Panel of skeptics headed by Steven Novella look at science and pseudoscience stories in the news with humor. Informative and often funny, but can verge towards being a little 'preachy' at times.

* 
**The Sporkful** - Short food podcast for 'eaters, not foodies'. In-depth discussion of issues such as the best buffet strategy, what toppings a pizza should have, and how to eat a bagel.

* 
**Philosophy Bites** - Short (~20min) podcast on a topic from philosophy.

* 
**History of Philosophy** - Similar to Philosophy Bites, but as the name suggests, on a historical philosopher or topic.

* 
**The Cultural Gabfest** - Intelligent discussion about and reviews of latest movies, books, tv etc.

* 
**The Ethicist** - Two ethical queries sent in by readers answered in this very short podcast (5min) by Randy Cohen each week, e.g. things like 'My professor said he'd give me a higher grade if I help out after class'.

* 
**The Infinite Monkey Cage** - Witty science and comedy chat with Prof Brian Cox, Robin Ince and guests and audience.

* 
**The Dave Gorman Podcast** - Humorous chat with Dave, Danielle and Martin. Half the podcast is the chat from the live weekly radio show, and the other half podcast-only material including listener's submissions of real-life businesses for Pun Street.

* 
**Savage Love Podcast** - No-holds-barred sex advice for listeners' problems from the open-minded and highly entertaining Dan Savage.

* 
**The Perfect Ten** - Phil and Phil answer 10 listeners' questions in their inimitably funny way. Definitely adult-only comedy.

* 
**Frank Skinner on Absolute Radio** - Highlights of Frank's radio show with Emily and Gareth; often sparkling wit from one of Britain's top funny men.

* 
**The Moth Podcast** - People telling real stories from their lives on stage; can be compelling, funny, sad, bizarre, unsettling - depending upon the story and storyteller.

* 
**Buzz Out Loud** - Daily tech news from Molly Wood and the gang.

* 
**Stuff You Should Know** - Chuck and Josh give you the lowdown on a different topic each week in their easy-going and likeable yet informative style.

* 
**Stuff You Missed In History Class**, **Stuff to Blow Your Mind** - Also from the SYSK stable, 2 podcasts covering history and 'mind-blowing ideas'. Presenters not quite as engaging as Chuck and Josh, but good informative content.

* 
**Wiretap** - Surreal slices from the comedy life of Jonathan Goldstein.

* 
**Friday Night Comedy** - Weekly topical comedy from the BBC. Alternates between the brilliant News Quiz (panel comedy news game) and the not quite so funny Now Show (sketch show based on the week's news).

* 
**Material World** - Latest developments in science with the astoundingly enthusiastic Quentin Cooper interviewing the actual scientists and other people involved.

* 
**Great Lives** - Biography series: A celebrity chooses someone who's no longer with us as their great life, and discusses why with an expert on the person they've chosen and host Matthew Parris. Often fascinating alternate views even of people you thought you knew all about.

* 
**The Front Row Podcast** - Latest in the world of movies, plays, books, and culture with intelligent interviews with the directors, stars and authors by the incisive Matthew Lawson, who caused Russell Crowe to storm out in anger last year.

"Interestingly enough, this all went down in PA, which is where I am originally from (Pittsburgh area)

Back then, things were different (early 80's).  I think she was wrong in hindsight, but I am not opposed to corporal punishment at all.  People should stop being such pussies with their kids and crack em once and a while.  It's been done since the dawn of time as a way for parents to manage their kids.

Funny but true story of when I was ""arrested"" in 7th grade for lighting a trash barrel on fire in the recess yard:

I was near the smokers and the trash bin when a teacher came out during recess.  They all threw their cigs into the trash and moved away.  I was about 5 feet away with 2 other kids and didn't notice the thing turning to smoke and fire behind us as the teacher walked toward us.  We were busted for causing the fire, even though none of us had anything to do with it.

They called the cops who took us to the station (to teach us a lesson I guess).  I was terrified.  They couldn't reach my father, and were trying to reach my mother.  I remember crying and begging the officer not to call my mom, just keep trying for my dad.  I mean, I was freaked out as I knew what was in store.  

At one point he asked me why I was so afraid of my mother.  I told him whole heartedly I thought she would kill me the second she sees me if she found out.  He looked at me in good humor said, do you think with all of these officers around here that we would let your mother kill you?

I distinctly remember looking around the room and telling him ""You don't have enough.""

I meant it.

They put me in a holding cell, called my mother anyways.  OMG, I was terrified.

When they released me to her she drug me by my hand out of the building and started laughing and laughing.  I kept telling her I didn't light thing on fire it was the other kids, but she kept laughing.  I was told to go to my room, and nothing happened.

Years later my mother recounted this story to me from her side.  She said that when the officer called her and said why I was at the police station, he concluded with ""Lady, what is your secret?  Your son is absolutely convinced you will kill him and our entire police force won't be enough to stop you.""

This apparently amused her greatly and thus I got out of a whooping.","funny but true story of when i was ""arrested"" in 7th grade for lighting a trash barrel on fire in the recess yard:  i was near the smokers and the trash bin when a teacher came out during recess.","funny but true","funny","but",FALSE,"funny but true","true",NA,NA,1,"reddit",0.26806,"thick_non-moral_concepts_POS","positive",NA,NA,"thick_non-moral_concepts"

"Had one of the seniors streak through the school in a wrestling mask when I was a freshman. Yelled ""catch me if you can bitch. I oiled up before this"" at the school officer pushing his way through the crowd of students. 

Had another kid in my French class stand up and say "" miss this paper is a piece of sheet"". Teach tells him to gtfo, he refuses. Calls the principals, still refuses to leave and taunts them for not getting his name right. Cops come in, still refuses to leave. They think he's whacked out on acid or something but the guy was just protesting the fact that all this shit was happening because he made a joke. 

Saw the same kid stop traffic to throw snowballs at cars after class in January of freshman year. That same year I convinced him that if he ate an entire eraser he could have my (newish at the time) xbox360.... He only ate half, followed me home and loitered outside of my house with a stick for a half hour before I threw ten bucks out my door and told him to fuck off. 

In elementary school he purposefully pissed himself and chased kids (and teachers) around with his pissy hands. 

In the fourth grade he identified as a squirrel for the ENTIRE year. He kind of rekindled that passion during senior year when he got really into parkour. Guy was in a tree like most of the time. This got to the point that he scaled the outside of the school during his spare, climbing past three stories of classrooms full of kids.... That one had the Cops involved again, but the school was REALLY hard to climb and they didnt have any ladders on hand anywhere near tall enough. They kinda just yelled at him to get the fuck down until he eventually got bored and complied...he still got to walk and graduate a couple weeks later so I don't really know if he was charged with anything. 

Last we heard was three or four years ago he dicided he was a woman.

As unfortunate as this is, and as shallow as it may or may not be, when it comes to messages you  **must** stand out. I go on three or so dates a week with people I meet on OkCupid, so it's not as though all us girls are on there just to frustrate and not respond to guys.

"When my fiance and I first starting dating he lived in an apartment building that a lot of elderly people also lived in. He had a neighbour who seemed to be in his 70s who was friendly and funny, but there was something about him that just didn't sit right with me. I told my fiance (boyfriend at the time) about it and he said he got the same kind of feeling.

A few months later he was kicked out for exposing himself to an elderly woman who lived in the building too.","he had a neighbour who seemed to be in his 70s who was friendly and funny, but there was something about him that just didn't sit right with me.","friendly and funny","funny","but",FALSE,"friendly and funny","friendly",NA,NA,0,"reddit",0.70614,"thick_non-moral_concepts_POS","positive",NA,NA,"thick_non-moral_concepts"
"Well, I actually like that system. I agree that it's somehow weird and contr-intuitive, but in reality, it would be difficult to hit anyone with weapon you aren't proficient with, especially when you out of stamina. While in Skyrim you can gently smash enemies with warhammer even if you exhausted, your strength is about 0 and you don't like weapons in general. Same with magic, you can be illiterate barbarian, but somehow Skyrim still allows you to cast spells. Also, I like Morrowind skill system, because it visibly rewards you for making progress - on 50th rank you succeed in almost every common task, on 75th you easily pass hard checks and on 100th you are demigod of particular skill. In Skyrim you have perks tho, they are very funny, but best ones I get in the moment, when game becames boring and this ruins the fun for me.","in skyrim you have perks tho, they are very funny, but best ones i get in the moment, when game becames boring and this ruins the fun for me.","funny, but best","funny","but",TRUE,"very funny , but good","good","very",NA,1,"reddit",0.74339,"thick_non-moral_concepts_POS","positive",NA,0.1983,"thick_non-moral_concepts"
"I had two— they’re very rewarding! Very sweet and funny. But they are in fact a very big responsibility. They need all of what you’ve said plus large amounts of attention. If you’ve left something for them to get into, they will. They’re like ferrets but so so soft and marginally more maintenance. Definitely not a match if you don’t want to put in a decent amount of effort.","very sweet and funny.","sweet and funny","funny","but",FALSE,"very sweet and funny","sweet",NA,"very",0,"reddit",0.66504,"thick_non-moral_concepts_POS","positive",0.1983,NA,"thick_non-moral_concepts"
"I can relate. And in my case even nobody did anything wrong. It just so happened that there was no appropriate warning, the movie was advertised as odd and funny but suddenly I saw gang rape. Burnt itself deep into my brain and haunts me now and then still. It's been about 17 years now. 

The whole idea that kids are too young to remember is the same as they are too young to be harmed is horse shit! Small kids, any kids, are very receptive towards any emotional display, especially strained voices, angry or loud tones. And that they don't understand them makes it worse! The world they experience is so closely connected to them, they have no means to distance themselves or distinguish play from reality. 

If OP says the play is so tough that it is hard to take for adults, she was already way deep into abusing her kid by ENTIRELY neglecting her kid's being, needs and health. Cps should know about this.
