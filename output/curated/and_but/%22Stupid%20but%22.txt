(as long as you don't have dietary needs) obviously during lockdown you're not allowed to travel 40-90 miles for you're weekly shopping especially as quite a few fueling station's are shut. (only unmanned supermarkets petrol stations are open from what I have seen)   The other problem is holiday lets are generally owner by two people up here from England and cities in Scotland like Glasgow and Edinburgh which would be easier for local shops to cope with just two more people in towns with say 100-200 houses that are mostly empty 60% of the year but many of these holiday let owners have brought other family members. (nearby me I have about 20 holiday lets in my street and the one behind me and my neighbors ( an old English couple let out the property for holidays have brought about 6 people with them to stay during lockdown this is obviously stupid but many people have done this and has made towns of between 500-2000 people turn into towns of 1000-5000 people depending on the quantity of people they brought with them and the amount of holiday lets in each town)"

'  i thought that normal people my age would make plans to go out, but they didnt. and i thought that i was the only one who had to make the effort into hanging out, because i was constantly the one reaching out to them. but turns out, i was wrong and that was their thing.   so my advice, is to go to a place ( it doesnt have to be a bar. it could be a restaurant, fast food joint etc. )  and try mingle with anyone in your way. go about the same hours - noon, or after 5 when people get off work. get to know the regulars there and try striking up simple conversations with them. just remember that its ok to have small talk at first in order to form much more deeper bonds, if thats what you say you want. also, try befriending the bartender/the staff working there.  trust me on this."
