[hell, there's books written and effect kits for all this](https://www.penguinmagic.com/tricks/tagged/seance), as it's been a staple of stage magic for a very long time, going in and out of fashion every decade or two.    doing it on a stage in las vegas and throwing some humor in it can make a great act, or [a gun thing to do if you are penn and teller at stephen spielber's bachelor party](https://www.wired.com/story/penn-jillette-spielberg-seance/).   claiming to be a medium, or spirit guide or talker, or shaman and taking money from folks mad with grief from losing a husband  or daughter or best friend *and pretending to talk to the spirits their dead loved ones on the other side* is cruel and unethical *at best*, and ***truly scummy when they charge for it or do it on tv or video to build a reputation and brand, as well as grooming potential marks for later fraud***. these fuckers prey on the people weakened by grief and loneliness, and will bilk your grandparents out of everything they can.   context and honesty is everything with stuff like this."
