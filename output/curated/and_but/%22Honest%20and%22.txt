"honest","and",NA,"open",NA,0,"text13141","i tried it with a partner and it failed miserably, because my partner didn’t know how to go to therapy. i had been in therapy for a few years and made a lot of progress on my personal issues, so when i suggested we see a couples therapist together to talk about our joint problems (primarily sex), they agreed.   the first session, she asks why we’re there and i explain to the best of my ability everything that’s happening. my partner clams up and is stoic. after we get out they turn to me with this betrayed look and ask how i could tell her all our personal stuff like that.   i was completely shocked and realized we were going in with such different approaches. i tried explaining to them that that’s how therapy is and we went a few more times, but they remained pretty quiet and ended up more shut off. it wasn’t doing anything so we stopped going and eventually broke up. since we separated i’ve come to suspect that they realized things they didn’t want to say in front of me, like how they were harboring anger towards me. if they had had their own therapist so they could have spoken in privacy, or if we had gone to our couples one at separate times a few times, maybe it would have worked better.   i am still a huge believer that therapy and couples therapy can be helpful and even life changing, but for any kind of therapy the person or people involved need to be willing to be honest and open about their thoughts, otherwise there’s no way to make progress.   i think it’s also important to remember that couples therapy is meant to reach a solution, and it may not be the solution you’re hoping for. the goal is to either improve the relationship or end it on as good terms as possible. people want to go to couples therapy to fix their messy relationships so they can stay together, but therapy is about making a healthy choice, and sometimes there’s no way to make staying together a healthy choice. couples therapy can result in a separation and still be a positive experience if the alternative would be staying together and being miserable or a much more messy breakup without therapy to help smooth it out."

(from antizionism to antisemitism). this was a writing written after the anti-zionist turn of the western european left around 68, but not a polemic, poliakov analyzes more like a historian. essential content are chapters on the soviet union, the arab world and the french left. the chapter on the soviet union is actually the essential one. he shows the history of the antizionism of the soviet union, from the question of nationality to the antisemitic turn in stalinism, doctors plot, slansky trial. in the end, zionist simply replaces the word jew, which was veiled in the soviet union anyway. the writing is supplemented by an essay on the german left. i am also surprised that there seems to be no english translation for a standard reference like poliakov.  \- bucharin - ökonomik der transformationperiode (i think it is in english economy in soviet russia?). is surprisingly boring. actually the seventh chapter is only interesting because he goes crazy about proletarian coercion from forced labor to shootings.   \- moses hess - ökonomische schriften (economical writings). this is a reader who actually wants to answer the question of what influence hess had on the critique of political economy. but in the end, it is a very general selection. interesting, but it misses the topic. but i do not know if one has to read more from hess regarding these writings. with rom und jerusalem it would have been a very round thing.  \- marx - kapital 1.1. i had it for a while so i read it. i was a bit confused in the meantime, but actually it is just an edition of marx results of the direct production process, which was rearranged in the chapter order. but of course it was quite a nice read.  \- jacek ossowski - rosa luxemburg. eine streitschrift. (rosa luxemburg. a polemic) this is a short document that was smuggled out of the soviet union. rosa luxemborg always becomes a theme, but in fact it is a criticism that goes back again and again to showing fundamental problems in dealing with pink luxemburg in the soviet union. that wasnt the most interesting thing at all. that was the foreword, which was very knowledgeable and left-communist. but that is not even the point at all. the author of the foreword was **joschka fischer**. well i dont know. you always think that those who came from the road werent \"pure\" enough or without thorough knowledge, but these things make it even more complicated."
