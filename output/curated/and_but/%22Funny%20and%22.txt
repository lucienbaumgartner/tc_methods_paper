"funny","and",NA,"great","pretty",1,"text14733","its a continuum...cheaper quality usually needs lower heat. higher quality concentrate can usually tolerate a wider variety of temps before charring up. so, thats one issue. charred or too-high temp on the banger means a bad hit. just my experience with terrapin and prism...they need super low temps, and still, they suck. the better the quality, the more range it has, to be dabbed at low or mid temps and all in between.      for consistency, price usually means a better quality   1. live resin   2. sugars, sauces   3. waxes   4. shatter     i like the live resins, but since they cost more, better deals can be with the sugars. sauces taste fantastic, but arent my favorite due to being tricky to work with. the live resin is easy and gives the best overall everything, but the cost. wax is nice to work with- easy to scoop and all, but needs a lower temp. shatter is the same and can even ben used to twax a joint and such. shatter has a lot of uses, but one of them is also just hanging out on the low end of the totem pole, effect wise. having said that, for some devices, like the pax3, the lower temps which is required for the shatters, is the only option- so if you can get good shatter, the devices are cool.      concentrates are where cannabis shines. be careful to be scientific about your dosing. dont get carried away or your tolerance will get unmanageable. soon, like many, you'll find that flower just doesnt satisfy you anymore, which for me, is pretty funny, and great. i have flower, and it can get me stoned, but not nearly as good, which for me, means more satisfaction and relief...which is the whole dang point anyways eh."

(dc gets the greeks, marvel gets the norse) which is why they seem like the norse are on top, cause easier for marvel to use them often  so in the end, there all pretty much the same powerwise, though odin may be more powerful if he kept the iron man suit, iron allfather (war of the realms read it, its funny and awesome)"

(i am not a conservative ash hole and believe medicare 4 all / socialized medicine is a smart move and investment. the corona virus is a perfect example why to do it. it just makes sense for multiple reasons.)"
