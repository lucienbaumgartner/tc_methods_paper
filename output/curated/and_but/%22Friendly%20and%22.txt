"friendly","and",NA,"cool","really",0,"text18795","the people/social environment are generally really friendly and cool. there are some clique tendencies in some social circles, but not really in an unhealthy way -- it's more that people form tight-knit friend groups and stick with them. there is a limited party scene, but it's not necessarily a big part of social life (kickbacks are much more common than parties, especially on campus).   the learning environment is really good imo. you end up forming close connections with professors just by virtue of being in small classes with them, and that goes a long way in making learning more personalized and effective. for instance, i'm a biochemistry/molecular biology student and i know basically everyone in the bio department and they know me. if you make the effort to reach out and form connections like that, you'll learn a ton and get plenty of opportunities to go above and beyond expectations in terms of major/graduation requirements.  as for ADHD, the student support services (SSS) office exists explicitly to mediate between students and faculty to ensure that you get the accomodations you need. you can talk with SSS staff at the start of the semester and they'll help you work out the accomodations you want and how to implement them in your classes. i admittedly don't know too much beyond that (my mental health disorders aren't well suited for accomodations), but there is a support apparatus for students with ADHD.  i hope that helps!"

Once again, Thaddeus’s ungodly 23 AC and use of *spirit guardians* utterly demolishes an encounter   &gt; Party continues through the stronghold, dealing handily with some floor traps and reaching a vast open space   &gt; Meet a giant human-faced snake construct, which greets the Deus and Freydis surprisingly warmly   &gt; It claims to be a construct made to guard the stronghold and the fragment until needed, and agrees to let them take it   &gt;

Continuing over a bridge constructed of pure energy, party finds a massive crowned figure reclining on a stone throne   &gt; Logan recognises it as one of the undead he fought previously, a desiccated corpse which rotted flesh with a touch   &gt; Party see a floating item under magical protection behind it, which they deduce to be Freydis’s artefact fragment   &gt; They decide to attack it, and Tiberius orders his armour to lift him and soars upwards as combat begins   Here is where it gets good.   &gt; Tiberius gets to go first, thanks to a natural 20 on initiative   &gt; Tiberius uses his bonus action to mark the dead king with *hex*, then casts *scorching ray*, firing off six blasts of fire   &gt;

Artefact is some sort of doomsday device, which could be used to end the world or save it from god-like machinations  &gt; She claims there is a stronghold under Forge, and she offers to keep her piracy out of the Republic in order to enter it  &gt; Tiberius recognises her description of the strongholds as that of the crypt from yesterday, confirming her claim  &gt; The Deus asks the party's opinion before agreeing to her deal, as they're his \"adventuring companions\"  &gt; Logan doesn't care, and Thaddeus bows to whatever the Deus wants but insists on going along to watch her  &gt; Tiberius says they should do it to protect the people from piracy (but is actually just curious about this old magic shit)  &gt; The Deus agrees to her terms and they decide to go down and try find the fragment immediately  &gt; Tiberius and Logan are the only ones who know how to get there, so lead the way into the sewers and to the crypt  &gt; In the crypt, Freydis presses her hand against a wall, causing it to react to her presence and magically retract  &gt; Group process onwards to another door and get jumped by 10 shadows, but actually deal with them with no trouble  &gt; Once again, Thaddeus's ungodly 23 AC and use of spirit guardians utterly demolishes an encounter  &gt; Party continues through the stronghold, dealing handily with some floor traps and reaching a vast open space  &gt; Meet a giant human-faced snake construct, which greets the Deus and Freydis surprisingly warmly  &gt; It claims to be a construct made to guard the stronghold and the fragment until needed, and agrees to let them take it  &gt; Tiberius asks about potential dangers, it says some of the people stored here in eternal sleep have risen as undead  &gt; Snaky directs them to a magical lift, they descend and find a massive maze, so Logan summons his pegasus mount  &gt; He flies over the maze, sees a route through as well as several open chambers, and is shot at by animated armour  &gt; Logan returns and tells them he saw chambers with animated armour, piles of gold, and nothing  &gt; Thaddeus suggests them go through the empty ones but Tiberius suggests dealing with the armour to avoid an ambush  &gt; Logan wants to kill shit so off they go  &gt; Party goes to find armour, is attacked by oozes disguised as the stone floor, easily butchers through them  &gt; Party reaches armour to find them friendly and obedient, Tiberius excitedly takes control over them  &gt; One carries him, flying through the air with the others flying in flanking formation  &gt; Party checks out the gold next, finds it's an illusion and kill the four mimics that attack them  &gt; Continuing over a bridge constructed of pure energy, party finds a massive crowned figure reclining on a stone throne  &gt; Logan recognises it as one of the undead he fought previously, a desiccated corpse which rotted flesh with a touch  &gt; Party see a floating item under magical protection behind it, which they deduce to be Freydis's artefact fragment  &gt; They decide to attack it, and Tiberius orders his armour to lift him and soars upwards as combat begins  Here is where it gets good.  &gt; Tiberius gets to go first, thanks to a natural 20 on initiative  &gt; Tiberius uses his bonus action to mark the dead king with hex, then casts scorching ray, firing off six blasts of fire  &gt; MFW four of blasts land and three of them are critical hits  &gt; That's 14d6 fire damage and 7d6 necrotic damage, and mummy lords just happen to be vulnerable to fire  &gt; I roll and tell the DM my damage, and he stares at me through the internet  &gt; DM.exe has stopped working  &gt; MFW the DM describes four hellish blasts of fire slamming into the dead king, instantly incinerating him on the spot  &gt; MFW the boss fight ends in a single round (there were some minions we curb stomped) thanks to a single spell  &gt; Tiberius and his imp Destromoth just cackle madly in midair, then descend and search for items of interest  &gt; While the others grab the fragment, he finds a bunch of magic items he tucks away to identify for the party later  &gt; Party leaves the area and head back to Snaky, and the DM ends the session there  &gt; I chuckle as he curses my climax-fucking lucky rolls, and we all sign off until next session    ---  v0.6.0 | This message was posted by a bot."
