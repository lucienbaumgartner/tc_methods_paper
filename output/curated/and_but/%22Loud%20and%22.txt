 the guy who sold it said he got it new, barely played it for 3 years as a kid, and then left in a corner for a decade, and i'm inclined to believe him. the frets were covered in corrosion, but they had basically no wear on them. after polishing the frets and oiling the fretboard the neck looks like new. the body has a couple of dings on them, but only on the front, and none on the back. all in all it's in really good condition where it matters, it was filthy as hell when i got it, but after a cleanup it's really nice  &amp;#x200B;  spec wise this is an alder body, maple neck, rosewood fingerboard superstrat. jackson JT580 licensed floyd, 24 massive frets as you'd expect, 12-16\" compound radius, and a HSS configuration with a TB4 in the bridge and 2 STK1 noiseless single coils. 5 way switch which does not split the humbucker, tone, volume, done. really straight forward, tried and proven recipe.  &amp;#x200B;  playability wise this thing is utterly insane. i have not gotten the setup perfect yet cause i went from 9-42 strings to 9-46, but it already play insanely well. i'm shocked to say that it might even beat my SLSMG in terms of sheer playability. the neck shape is that shallow D that jackson just do better than anybody else, the neck is wide, the compound radius makes it comfy from the first fret to the last. love it. the floyd flutters OK and holds the tuning really nicely, the arm comes loose after a bit of use though. it's one of the screw over top types, i might need to do something about that. not the best floyd ever, but it does the job and hasn't caused me much headache so far, which is my main concern. the only thing hindering the playability a bit is the old school blocky heel. its recessed a bit, but that doesn't really help much. i've played neck through guitars for the past 5 years, i need to get used to that again  &amp;#x200B;  sound wise, there's sustain in this guitar, there's an excellent response to tapping and legato, it's loud and resonant when played unplugged. nice prominent mids on it, lots of floyd rose bite on top, just as you'd expect from what is an 80s shred machine at heart.  pickup wise i'm not sure i'll get along with the JB though. it's super popular, it's a proven choice for the hair metal crowd, but i don't know whether i might end up swapping it out. the JB has an insane amount of midrange, to the point where it can sound pretty nasal. add that on top of the already mid heavy sound of the unplugged guitar and i think it might be overdoing it. i found an 80s gibson HB-L (those are the Bill Lawrence made ones with the PCB on the bottom) in a drawer a while ago, and it's is currently in my strat. i think that might be a better fit.   the STK1s though completely blew me away. first of all they are REALLY noiseless. you'd think you hit a killswitch when you flip to them. second, they sound really great. i expected that i might want to put an SC size humbucker in the neck position, but i'm really enjoying those pickups. you need a bit more gain, but there's so much clarity in fast picking runs, so much detail in the pick attack, i adore those things. also they made me appreciate guys like yngwie even more, your picking has to be 100% on point with these things. but when you get it right it's so rewarding. they sound great clean too, but i haven't spent much time playing clean cause this guitar just wants to shred so hard.  fit and finish is great as you'd expect from a japanese jackson, apart from the trem arm coming loose i have no complaints. i think the potentiometers are a bit heavy and the 5 way switch is very notchy, i missed the bridge position a couple times. idk whether i'll just get used to it or swap it out yet. the finish is glossy black. because of course it is... idk why people ever thought it would be a good idea to put high gloss black on a surface that you are constantly touching. it proudly displays all the smudges, dust and scratches. you clean the thing, and 2 minutes later it looks disgusting again... i hate gloss black. my gloss black SLSMG is being refinished right now, as soon as i can buy spray cans again this thing will get a similar treatment. preferrably in some super shrill 80s colour, cause that's what this guitar should have come with in the first place  overall, unexpected addition to the collection, but definitely a good one. this is a really inspiring guitar to play, it just wants you to dig out all those iconic 80s riffs and licks. i've ben playing Whitesnake and Dokken for 2 days straight now. it's so easy to play, it wants to throw pinch harmonics everywhere, it's got a floyd, it's just an awesome guitar. even more so for 200 bucks lol"

"loud","and",NA,"loud","too",0,"text35103","i dunno, i use them interchangeably in my mind, as i'm not expert enough to tell you why db's versus lufs versus lkfs.  the compressor i couldn't really give you specific settings for, since it will really depend on your specific audio and how it sounds and how it was recorded. this tool/plugin is a bit harder to learn than the limiter or the eq. mike russell has a long video on the compressor, but it was super helpful to me. the short videos sort of said the same thing, but his video really got indepth and allowed me to understand the functionality.  basically what you want to set a compressor to do is to boost the quiet parts of your audio (so they're not too quiet), and also simultaneously it'll be aware of loud parts which it will compress down to your specifications. this has the effect of even-ing your audio out more. if you do it too much you'll lose the dynamic range of your audio (quiet parts are now too loud and louder parts have lost their oomph).  if you want to go down a rabbit hole of audio repair, look into izotope software. they occasionally have sales or cheaper packages with fewer tools/plugins available. definitely some very useful tools to deal with bad audio (although your goal is to get good audio from the get go so that you don't have to open up the doctor's audio repair kit at all).  good luck, hope this helps."
