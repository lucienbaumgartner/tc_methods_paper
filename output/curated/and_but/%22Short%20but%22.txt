"short","but",NA,"good",NA,0,"text1493","Overall thoughts on ROTE:  * Art was very nice much better than Turf Wars * Plot was a lot more interesting/intense and more things were going on * Fights were short but good in this trilogy   * P1 did a great job of setting things up with the Guan's plans, the democracy storyline, setting up Kuvira's background  * P2 had some great moments like team avatar getting captured, Kuvira escaping, Wu and Korra in the swamp, though near the end things were a little rushed * P3 at least devoted a significant amount of time to the brainwashing plot but it's impact wasn't that strong and was tied up quickly just like the flashbacks * Kuvira's final scenes were a bit too \"Kumbaya\" I think they should have toned it down a bit * Overall it was good and tried a lot of different things but should have worked on the ending and saved Kuvira's reintegration in the family much further in another trilogy perhaps, but I get they basically just wanted to get rid of her and move the series out of her shadow  * I still think it was better than Imbalance for at least trying new and many things and being more entertaining, but the ending was a bit out there with Kuvira's storyline being hastily finished * Excited for the next trilogy to finally move on from these S4 plotlines"
