"g02aypi","Intellectually: no child ever deserves to be shamed for making mistakes or having needs. No child deserves to be yelled at and have a parent control their behavior through rage, threats, and humiliation tactics. Children have the right to feel safe in their environment and in their relationship with their parents. The responsibility, when it comes to a child, is 100% on the parents.

Experientially: I did a lot of digging inside and exploring a very critical part of myself that learned early on that it's safer to blame myself and be cruel towards myself before my mom could abuse me. Because if I told myself these cruel things, then I wouldn't have to ever behave in a way that results in the pain of my mom neglecting and abusing me. I shoved my needs and feelings down so my mom wouldn't get mad at me for having them. This overly critical part of me was a protector. I got to know it, and could feel it in my body. I could feel anger and disgust towards myself. Then, I asked this part of me to step aside, and show me what is it that it's trying to protect. And I finally got a sense of this ""inner child"" people talk about, and over time I got to know her too. And I remembered what it was like to be her. To just want my mom to love me, and see me, and stop yelling at me. I wanted her to treat me like other kids' mom's, and show affection towards me. I wanted to be wanted. And I know now that this young girl, *me*, did absolutely nothing wrong. All those times my mom screamed at me, told me to go away, shut up, stop crying, get over it, ""there's something wrong with you"", those were her issues with being a mom. That was her inability to love and take care of me, and her inability to provide safety for a young, vulnerable girl who needed her. It was cruel and selfish. But that young version of me did nothing wrong. And it breaks my heart to think of her having to be buried inside of me all these years, and to be drowning in shame, just because my mom didn't know how to love her and show her that she does truly belong in this world. It's so fucked up to think about such an innocent and lovable child reaching for connection, and being met with hate and shame. Fuck her for making me feel all of that. 

And to this inner critic, I say thank you. Thank you for keeping me safe from the horror of being emotionally abandoned by my mom. But I need to to step aside and let the more wise, rational, and caring version of me lead this shit show from now on. I appreciate your help, but I got this from here.

1) To put it shortly, inclusion for all is the end goal.

However, the process of inclusion is one that is gradual.
Group by group will have to move motions and present their case and at this time, it's the Black lives Matter movement spurred into action by the significantly higher % of police brutality and profiling black people face. 

This might sound selfish but White people generally have no worries about their race being an obstacle or a burden. They have difficulties like everyone else but their race being used a parameter for judgement by power structures or figures of authority is one less thing to worry about. 

The American society as I like to say was built to reward whiteness.

 I have heard and seen white people this period feeling like their whiteness is under attack and that is missing the plot entirely. No sane black person is trying to diminish the hardships that white people face.


I appreciate you saying you understand how victimised black people feel, is it safe to assume that you're black? If you aren't, you can only see this from an 'outsiders' perspective and so you will never truly understand the urgency and exhaustion that black people feel since it's not your personal experience.

I also see a good number of white conservatives lumping looters and rioters as protesters thereby taking away from the protesters that are doing so with clearly laid out motives, you can not judge a whole group based on a rotten few who claim to be aligned with that group.
This logic is nonsensical and it irks me when people do this.

- You're right about data out there being manipulated and skewed thanks to author's bias.
Now a lot of them will swear they are objective but we who are realists know better.
That's why in my post I made sure to say 'Indisputable but debatable facts' being that these are truths that can not be denied but can be debated. 

I won't give a lecture here on systemic/structural racism and oppression but I'd provide you with resources that you could consider for a start just to give you some insight.

Hopefully some of the aforementioned resources will lead you in the right direction to do some more research by yourself.


5) White people are definitely not race identified as compared to black people and a simple answer for this will be the lasting generational impact of segregation.

Segregation instilled a sense of 'other' for black people and the only way to navigate the feeling of inferiority they had was to band together and re-iterate their identity as a people and race was the predominant factor here.

Doing so was an act of rebellion, building confidence and a sense of belonging,  giving affirmation and validation to themselves after donkey years of mockery and suppression of their identity.

That has obviously carried on until this day.
Black people learned to be by themselves because it's  'safer' that way and that went on to influence culture and interaction.

* That is not to say that there isn't interaction amongst both white and black people now.

A good book for this will be:  ""Why Are All the Black Kids Sitting Together in the Cafeteria? ""

6)  The stories about Floyd's criminal history are true.

I just happen to think that the stories of his criminal history have nothing to do with the brutality and eventual murder that was metted out against him and so Candace and her ill intentions were not necessary as nobody proclaimed Floyd a martyr.

He served time for his crime and that part of his life wrapped up in 2009.

His past has no bearing to the crime he was accused of at the time of his death.

Candace has a nasty, sketchy past but she refuses to address it so why would use the past of a man to taint him? A man who died tragically.

Her goal was to undermine the global attention his murder received, discredit the Black lives Matter movement and cause further disdain.

Her wall is filled with conservatives now back tracking on their sympathy and saying 'maybe he deserved to die' 'why is the world outraged about his death when he was a criminal' 

You might say she was providing you all with necessary information to judge a matter fairly but she conspicuously left out the criminal history of the police officer as well. Isn't that necessary information too?  

Do you now see how that appears?

"fsm5sx5","He's a narcissist. My dad is a narcissist. It's what they do.

The problem with narcissists is that they are SUPREMELY and COMPLETELY selfish. They literally don't understand the concept of empathy or 'to walk a mile in another person's shoes.' The problem is, most of the time that selfishness will come out in small, ""harmless"" ways. Asking your partner to do small chores or favors and getting denied because they're watching tv, or just don't feel like it. Little insults and mean words that were ""just a joke,"" things like that.

But let me give you an anecdote from my mom's life from when I was still a toddler. She had a miscarriage and started bleeding, so she asked my dad to drive her to the hospital... and he said ""no. I'm busy watching TV. Drive yourself."" So she took a deep breath and asked him to watch me while she drove herself to the hospital. To which he replied, with a sneer, ""no, YOU take him, YOU wanted him anyways, he's your responsibility.""

So she laid a towel down on the drivers seat, changed pants, got me in the car seat, drove me to my half brother's house for him to watch me, then drove herself to the hospital. When she came home, he didn't even acknowledge what had happened, and asked when dinner would be ready.

The problem with a narcissist is that they never, ever, EVER rise to the occasion. Most of the time they're just mean, abusive, and selfish. But when you really, truly need them to be better, you find out that there were never any unplummed depths within them, no hidden spine or courage. What you see is what you get, and since they aren't even capable of understanding the concept of 'another person's perspective' they won't even know what the big deal is. 

So when Trump saw the Covid crisis as an opportunity for graft, that was totally in line with his character.

"freghqt","I mentioned this in other comments. I'll paste a reply here:

&gt;I would like for negative connotations associated with terms like ""selfish"" and ""self-serving"" to be dispelled. I touched on this in another comment, but to summarize, acknowledging that an action can be both selfish and good is, to me, an important step toward acknowledging that multiple perspectives can transcend ideology and be considered without ideological bias to misrepresent them. 

Really, what I mean to do is posit that altruism and selfishness coexist in decisions, and there are varying levels of them in each decision. Further, one may never be rid of the selfishness inherent in wanting something, and this does not mean that an action is ""bad"" because there's a selfish component.

It is frustrating when selfishness is considered bad, when it is fundamental to human decision-making. All bad actions are selfish, but not all selfish actions are bad. Challenging misconceptions propagated by society is something I consider valuable, and in my opinion, this black-and-white reasoning leads to ideology, which kills unbiased discussion. In essence, this is a microcosm of a bigger issue I see with societal functioning. Having an unbiased discussion when both participants rely on ideology to supply their understanding leads to either agreement or disagreement on a single perspective, rather than acknowledging that multiple perspectives exist and rather than trying to prove one perspective better than the other because a perspective is supported by a particular ideology. The purpose of debate and discussion, in my opinion, should be to learn as much context as possible, to see which perspectives are best supported empirically by the context. This makes situational decisions possible, as the perspective one adapts can change depending on the given context, rather than relying on ideology which tends to disregard context, and by extension, perspectives which go against the ideological tenets, even if the evidence (context) supports those perspectives.

In short, generalized misrepresentation poses a huge limit on the ability of society to progress, and my post is about a microcosm of this generalized misrepresentation.",1590108547,"i touched on this in another comment, but to summarize, acknowledging that an action can be both selfish and good is, to me, an important step toward acknowledging that multiple perspectives can transcend ideology and be considered without ideological bias to misrepresent them.","selfish and good","selfish",NA,FALSE,"selfish and good","good",NA,NA,1

I mean I destroyed my body, lost out on so much sleep (way more sleep lost than the husband, who has always had an easy time falling asleep and staying asleep), and sacrificed my career a bit. I was so pissed I got fuck all for my first Mother's Day. Nothing. Like after half a year of doing it call could I have something? After that I started getting on my husband's ass more about chores and helping me, waking up at night etc. And I applied for grad school. I'm not just a mother. I'm me. And I'm taking me back.

I told her it was okay to feel like this. I'm just happy we have a place to vent. I mean it's not like these feelings consume my life or are present as much as they once were but they are still there. It really is better now that my son is 2 and a half and talking.

I only mentioned pregnant because I think it might be relevant. Anyways as she’s gotten larger and larger she’s having more difficulty with sleeping. We’ve tried a large body pillow but unfortunately she doesn’t like it, but What’s worked so far is her basically sleeping on top of me and it works just fine for her, she sleeps like a baby. But, I am getting little to no sleep and it sucks. She gets really hot during the night and I get sweaty and uncomfortable. On top of that her hair is all in my face and is tickling my nose and also her lying on top me makes it abit difficult to breath. The issue with this is that I’m still going to work and it’s making it really difficult to work when I’m constantly tired/exhausted. It sucks. I’m yawning in big meetings, I’m making uncharacteristic mistakes, and I’m just slagging along. Coffee just makes it worse because the eventual crash is sooo much worse than the high.

So I’ve tried to approach her with this and asked if we could maybe go see her O.B and find a solution and she declined saying she’s good. And I said well I’m not good though, my lack of sleep is severely impacting my performance (and in the only one in the household working so if I lose my job were effing screwed) and she basically told me to suck it up and not be selfish. But that’s not gonna help anything, I can’t just “suck it up” you know? I need sleep. I’m sorry but I do. So I said to her fine I’ll just sleep on the pullout couch then, hopefully more space will help you sleep better. She just scoffed and said see ya in bed tonight which kind of pissed me off, it just seems like she doesn’t give a shit about my wellbeing at the moment. So I asked her to please not be insensitive to my problems as well and she basically pointed to her stomach and said well you can complain when you carry one of these around and I said that’s not the damn issue here like why won’t you try to compromise for the both of us here? She yelled at me to go away so I did &amp; then she went above me to my mother and texted her and apparently said I’m being inconsiderate and selfish which I think is a load of bull..

I personally really love Football, Feminism and You as a starter ep.

It starts of early enough that you don't feel like you've missed major plot points and character development, and it's a pretty tightly knit and funny episode. Abed gets his schtick in early on even though he doesn't do much the rest of the time. But all the other characters get really good moments where they can bounce off each other.

Annie is in love with Troy and is possessive as a result.

Jeff calls out Annie for being selfish but they both meet in the middle eventually.

Jeff is selfish and manipulative, which Troy eats up without question, but also has his growth moment at the end.

They have their fantastic racism dialogue, which is still one of the best moments of the series.

The dean is hilarious here. Him and Pierce make the human colour chart, which shows Community's fascination with identity politics and the hilarity that comes with them.

Shirley teaches Britta to be softer, which is a nice small moment that then feed's into Annie's storyline.

**Physical**

The gym is closed, but they've been posting home workouts everyday, and I've been doing most of them. I don't have access to really heavy weights, so I doubt I'm getting stronger, but I've been extra focused on what I can do, so things like core work. I never realized how weak my core is until now. That's probably why I've stalled on the big lifts like squats and deadlifts. Diet is ok, not as good as it was before quarantine, but working on getting better. My wife actually cooked some fairly healthy stuff this week!

**Relationships**

I'm trying to get better at leading my wife. That's still a really weak area. I did have some tiny success recently. The couch was covered in clothes and mail and other random clutter, and while she was sitting nearby I just started cleaning without saying anything. It wasn't long before she got up to help, and she ended up finishing the job. Now the couch is clean.

My wife called me out recently for not showing her enough affection, so I've been trying to work on that (more kino?). I think the past couple weeks have been better. And I've been able to STFU when annoyed with her.

**Spiritual**

I've been reading A Praying Life by Paul Miller. I like it so far. Every time he digs in to reasons we don't pray or problems we have while praying I think, ""hmm, that sounds like me."" Things like cynicism and not being dependent on God enough, even with the little things, and not being honest about what I want. Example: It feels weird to pray that my wife will lose weight. It seems ungrateful and selfish. But if God wants us to come to him like little children then that means opening up and being honest, right? Why should I be more honest with strangers on Reddit than with my creator?

Church is streaming only. On Sunday the preacher called out husbands who aren't leading by singing the hymns. I sing in church, although very quietly.

"foeqeie","I get what you’re trying to say, but isn’t that a little harsh? I’m sure OP knows this person rather well and having been in a position of unrequited love before, it can feel really selfish to push your feelings onto someone you know doesn’t return them, all because you couldn’t deal with them/get over them on their own. Disregarding someone’s feelings for yourself is not only selfish but incredibly difficult. I don’t understand how their unrequited love is being tied to his reaction of withdrawal, as if he knows about their feelings. If he does then I feel as though using that as fuel for anger or as a reason to withdraw is reaching. If he’s upset, the real reason is that OP is moving, and from what OP has shared with us I can’t say it makes sense for him to be angry that they’re not being honest, as it seems you’re suggesting.

I’m also curious as to what you mean by “no options but to withdraw from the situation”? If he calls himself a friend to OP, he should be there for them. It’s okay to be upset, but people move. Change is a part of life and suggesting that OP can’t be upset not only about the move but also that their friend has in essence ghosted them is honestly not very nice. From the way OP speaks of the move it seems they’re feeling backed into a corner, if anyone is being self centered is it not OP’s friend?

If being thoughtful enough to pause and try to understand where someone is coming from before deeming them “too much work to figure out” to you I seriously worry for you.

"fmp41cg","The problem with the above is it defines Evil so strongly that almost no playable characters will be Evil.  If any D&amp;D character that could be correctly labeled as Evil is not going to be effective in a group and thus isn't playable, why is it a possible alignment for a PC?  (I'm ignoring the all-Evil games people sometimes run, where alignment is really irrelevant at a per-character level.)

I prefer to think about Good as ""altruistic"" and Evil as ""selfish"".  A character who's Lawful Selfish likes rules because they can be used to help them personally, like a town guard who demands a bribe to let you in.  That's the sort of definition that still allows the character to be useful in a group.

I also think paladins can then have a variety of alignments while still being a paladin.  An Oath of Ancients or Oath of Devotion paladin probably needs to be Altruistic; their tenets fundamentally call out their mission to help other people.  An Oath of Heroism paladin could really be of any alignment; their tenets are essentially ""be awesome"" and they could be awesome and selfish or awesome and helpful.  An Oath of Conquest paladin is more likely to be selfish, but I could imagine an altruistic one that genuinely thinks he must defeat his enemies or his people will be destroyed.

That's a really good thing.  If all paladins must be Lawful Good, then either all paladins have the same morals (which is boring) or their morals aren't effectively represented by their alignment (in which case why have the alignment?).  It allows differentiation without going all the way and becoming an Oathbreaker which basically has capital-E Evil leaking out of their pores.",1586274029,"an oath of heroism paladin could really be of any alignment; their tenets are essentially ""be awesome"" and they could be awesome and selfish or awesome and helpful.","awesome and selfish","selfish",NA,FALSE,"awesome and selfish","awesome",NA,NA,0
"fm6due9","While I largely agree with you, I think the problem here is of the government's own making. Basically a dangerous viral infection is the time when we as the public need to engage in good faith with our leaders and be willing to make sacrifices for the common goal (saving lives). But politicians have spent years trashing that sentiment in the public mind, constantly running down both the role of government itself and the advice of experts, for cheap rhetorical point-scoring.

Sure, the people packing beaches and pubs were irresponsible and selfish. But part of the reason they ignored the advice from leadership is because they've been trained to do so for so long by a political class actively encouraging political ignorance. Politicians have spent years abusing the trust of the public and now that it's actually needed, it's gone. They've pissed all their good faith up against a wall on corruption and cynical political game-playing and none is left for the moment we really *should* engage in good faith. 

So while I wish they hadn't crowded onto the beaches because I don't want my nan/cancer-surviving immunocompromised friend to die, I think it's entirely unsurprising that government got a big fat ""yeah nah"" when it asked people to ""trust us, this time it's serious"".

"fjj9158","(This'll be kinda long but I find it really interesting)

I might only be speaking for myself here, but I actually really think you struck a chord with this. I'm a voter, and I believe other people should vote if they have a right, but yeah I guess if you genuinely dont care about any issues you dont ""owe"" it to anyone to vote.

That being said, you **DO** seem to have some political stances you care for, they just arent borne out anywhere in the politics of your country as-is (this is an assumption I made based on your wording, if Im wrong I guess you can stop reading here lol). What do you say to the idea that by choosing to abstain, youre effectively endorsing the status quo, and thus actively pushing against your own stances? 

One thing I've learned recently (and I'd be willing to bet a lot of people dont/didnt understand this) is that if you want to effect change, you **HAVE** to do so incrimentally, small shift by small shift. This doesnt mean you're abandoning your true position, this just means that, realistically, your views are too far of a jump away from current policy to be immediately viable.

In short: you need to play the long game. Sure, right now you may not see any of your views pushed by any candidates, but there **MUST** be a candidate(s) who is more closely aligned with your views than the others, however much or little that is in actuality. Even if you dont care about the struggles of others (which you may or may not, I dont know you), wouldnt you agree that it would be in your own best interest to vote for such a candidate? If it could potentially shift the country's politics even one micrometer in favor of your true position, wouldnt you say thats something worth your time? Of course, you might not win, but you dont really lose much of anything in the process besides maybe a couple hours and a bit of discomfort standing in line.

I think a lot of the frustration people have towards non-voters is that many will *claim* to care about an issue and complain about its ramifications but won't go out and use their right  explicitly designed to try to change it. I'd argue that you have a right not to vote if you choose to, but exercising that would effectively nullify your right to complaint; nobody cares what you have to say about an issue if you're all talk ya know? Not just in politics, anywhere in life. As long as someone understands that then sure, I say they're in their rights to abstain.

And to your credit, I dont think its that much more ""selfish"" to abstain than to vote if you genuinely do not care, so long as you admit (which you did) it *is* a selfish view, just like many voters really need to admit to themselves that *their* views and the ways *they* vote could also be seen as incredibly toxic and selfish. But I'd still argue that it's better to vote and advocate for people to educate themselves to vote properly than to abstain and say ""fuck it leave the idiots to govern everything."" I doubt i'll budge you on that point though but whatever.

"fj1ft7f","DISCLAIMER: Here be sciolism.\*

\* noun: superficial knowledge. .


The following text presumes consciousness not as a signal received by a meat-engine, but rather a product thereof: 

THE MEME THAT SAVED THE WORLD

The preoccupation of the self is as old as life. Amoebae pursue sources of energy, it's chemistry (which is, in turn, just fancy physics). And if you believe in chemistry, your preoccupation of self is itself a descendant of genetic blueprints reproduced since the dawn of life. Your brain state is chemical in nature too, after all. 

These inherited behavioral blueprints are really the only way non-intelligent life (chemically assembled and animated machines of molecules and proteins etc) could have survived. The simplest and most effective arrangement of chemicals (aka: organisms) were the ones that had just one imperative to which to apply their agency: Live.

One tool these evolving forms eventually discovered was what I'll call 'emotive chemistry'. Imagine if one of these organisms were hard-wired to respond to the beck-and-call of the ancestral chemicals? That would be a reliable way to ensure progeny, surely worthy of passing down the genetic line. Not the only way though, to be fair; consider comparing something like a mindless bacteria to the mothering instincts of a crocodile. 

But here we are. Currently the most successful iteration of chemistry in the known universe. I propose we are the children of sapience; literally: its first iteration. By sapience, I refer to the unique quality that we typically consider to be exclusive to humans; awareness of self (I do think some of our fellow terrestrial species are close behind, though, and could use our help (not to mention specific members of our own species as well)).

By mentioning a first iteration, I know some will want me to explain what a second iteration might be: I say, ask a fish about what it's like being us (more or less). I realize this is unsatisfactory; it has to be. I see no way of knowing, but one (more on that later), what will leave us behind. But, in summation, the inarguable vastness of this progression can be useful to establish certain facts about ourselves.

There was already a singularity:  when memetic information systems outpaced genetic information systems in manipulating the world to the advantage of the organism. We are currently in a memetic primordial soup and our chemical-machinery isn't ready-made for the memetic model; initially, we needed genetically approved stimuli to trigger a self to action. But with the advent of sapience, memetic stimuli began to be permitted. 

You are afraid to die because you haven't mastered your Darwin-given genetic software; you do need it, to an extent, so there's no shame in it. The real world is still dangerous and selfish. But sapience is the ability to be *self aware*; that is, *aware of what motivates your emotions and behavior*. Is it genetics, or memetics? Either way, your sapience let's you *be aware of it*; 'it' being  just information. And a side-effect of our sapience is the ability to conceive abstractions regarding information: consider comparing the ability of certain animals to recognize themselves in a mirror. The whole thrust of which is: you have agency, and sapience. 

Genetically, you will never overcome your fear of death. Religions are memes designed to address this. I choose a different meme: one based in the scientific method, one I don't really understand or have a name for yet, but serve with faith, as it were. It provides comfort in the form of expanding your near-obsolete\* sense of self to include the systems you are part of, just as all the molecules and atoms in your body make you. It would provide a canvas for a durable legacy, assuaging fears of passing unseen and unheard into the void.

Be warned: applying your agency to the choosing of your parent systems requires sapience; literally: wisdom. Most of us are victims of ignorance, held down to keep our agency from fruition. Think critically about whose intentions you are applying your agency to, and why it may be beneficial for a  primarily genetically-motivated self to disadvantage you. Personally, the current swell of modern American politics (yes, Bernie) tickles all the right memes in my book.

\*In the sense that we are, more or less, actively trying to improve our living conditions from barbarism to true civilization, generally. In the version of the world we all (I hope) seek to achieve for the future, you don't have to identify as only your self anymore; *the fight for survival is over*. We are not in that world, yet. 

tl;dr: go back to the top; this is the short version

I was on the bus to university which is about an hour away from where I stay. Now I'm tall and have long legs (5'11) and if you have ever been on a bus you know the seating can be quite cramped. I found a seat and sat down, the seat not having enough leg room and my knees almost touching the front seat but I got comfortable and was chilled.

After 4 stops, an older woman got on and decided to sit in the seat infront of me. This would have been fine if she sat down like a normal person, instead she leaned forward and fell into the seat. Forcing the seat back and smacking into my knees (hurt a bit if I'm honest). I was annoyed but whatever, these things happen so I got relaxed again.

This should have been the end of it but no. Every few minutes she decided to readjust herself. Leaning forward and pushing herself back into the seat, making the seat repeatedly smack my knees. I started to get irritated when she turned around and told me to move. No manners, no courtesy, just ""will you move, I can't get comfortable"".

I was irritated enough but was surprised at this. I kept my cool and said about the bus journey and saying sorry but I'm not moving. The woman got defensive and said how she is a lot older than me and needed the seat, how I was being rude and that my knees against her chair is annoying her. I then just said ""I can't help my height but you could always move yourself. There are a lot of other seats so take your pick if you aren't happy. You aren't that old that you can't do that"". 

The woman proceeded to mumble and call me rude and selfish but she never moved and I didn't hear a peep out of her the rest of the way. When I got to university I told my friend and she said that I was an asshole for not moving. Now I'm thinking, was I? AITA?

*ALL the time. It works if it's them singing some kind of spell/witchcraft, but it's always painful to watch when it's just RAS yet again forcing his shows to be Glee. He already ruined Riverdale- a show with a ton of potential that's sadly been written horribly- they need to step in and stop him from ruining shows.

&gt;I hate the way they wrote Nick

Honestly I disagree. They didn't write his plot as a way of breaking him &amp; Sabrina up, him being totally different and traumatized made sense for his character. Plus Nick/Sabrina is overwhelmingly popular. If people were expecting Nick to come back from Hell and immediately go back to normal, your expectations are unrealistic.

&gt;Their relationship fell apart so easily

I kinda agree, but I'm not sure. The issue is that they never really had a big convo where they addressed Nick's PTSD, so it felt like their ending lacked closure.

&gt;They saved Nick in 1 episode?

I do agree, but to a point. I like that they picked up where part 2 left off, but we also gotta remember that Sabrina does have a sort of friendship with Lilith. They left part 2 on friendly terms. So making Lilith this arch-nemesis wouldn't be totally accurate and wouldn't make sense; she's complex and selfish, but was able to co-exist with Sabrina at the end of part 2.

I met a girl on a night out with mutual friends once and got along really well. Got invited to a party she was having a month or so later and had a real connection. We end up talking as good mates and she has a huge fight with her boyfriend and ends up telling me she has feelings for me. I say I'm flattered but I refuse to do anything until she breaks up with him. That didn't last long though, and we fell for each other HARD, or at least I fell for her anyway. I'll never know if she felt the same about me or she was just happy that I gave her the attention that she wanted at the time. I wanted to get serious with her, but she was unsure as she had been with this guy for a long time and had a house with him. I was so madly in ""love"" that I did literally everything I could to make her pick me, unintentionally putting a ton of pressure on her. One night, she told me that they'd broken up, so we slept together. I was so happy thinking that we had a chance, but it turns out it was a lie. I can't say I was an angel though as we were dating behind his back, with the only thing I refused to do was have sex with her.
The boyfriend found out and understandably lashed out, and I lashed out back at him giving him all kinds of shit.
I was considering moving out of my parents' house even though I was on minimum wage just so we could be together. I was going to sacrifice everything I had, but it just didn't happen. She tried to leave me a bunch of times and I wouldn't have it, and I would talk to her in any way I could bar in person. We even used her work email to chat without getting caught. 
One day she said it's over, don't speak to me again, so I said okay, I'm not fighting anymore and blocked her on all social media and deleted her phone number. I was bitter for nearly 2 years, saying that she hurt me bad, broke my heart, she was evil and led me on etc., but in reality I was pretty fucking bad if not worse.

So, I have two friends, I care for them deeply and they both have issues. 

For a bunch of months now, I have been talking to them and they would be to me about the troubles (I'm not putting them here because it's their personal business, just know it's pretty fucked.) One of my friends, lets call them E has got pissed at me and stopped talking to me unless it was problems with B. (fake name for my other friend.) We got into a fight, and E had been acting pretty harsh to me, and after a while they admitted it was to guilt me into apologizing to B. I was pissed at this but didn't let it show. I apologized to B but she didn't answer. She started ignoring E now and I texted her again telling her to please open up. But I also told E that all the issues they were having was really taking a toll on my mental health and gave me panic attacks, and i was just 12. E just said bye and left the chat. I'm feeling pretty guilty and selfish but I do stand by what i say. Am i the asshole?

"f85icz1","The issue is what you define to be right and left as.   Many confuse a free market with being right and a central economy with being left.  Leftists confuse authoritarianism with being right wing, and so on.

Most agree that people on the right understand a natural order, specialization and hierarchy to be necessary and desirable.  The left sees this is a system they personally can't flourish in and therefore they demonize it as racist or whatever.

Therefore the true definition or right and left is that the right can see the good of the community and nation as being more important than their own good, however by being a member of a healthy community they too can prosper though hard work.  Competition and conflict are normal, healthy and make everyone better.

The left is entirely greedy and selfish.  They don't care about the good of the people around them.  They are always lazy and mediocre at best, so they see meritocracy as a threat.  They wish to dominate and no one wants a lazy, unattractive midwit to rule over them.  However they can't be open about this, they have to hide what they are doing behind a sales pitch of equality, peace and whatever other nonsense.

If you apply these you'll generally see far right and far left policies fitting into these boxes.  I can't think of any exceptions off hand. Unfortunately modern conservatives and civnats are really just leftists without the desire to dominate and control.  That's what centrism is - lazy, selfish, but with a halfhearted desire for a healthy community.    For example the right sees their children as the future, to be taught and cherished and other people's children as a potential threat.  The left sees children as a nuisance or a sex object.  Centrists see them as the future, but also a nuisance and competing alien children aren't really a threat.

When true right wing values are applied on a national level you see an almost magical improvement in all aspects of life.  You call America an economic powerhouse, but Nazi Germany put it to shame in all relevant metrics.  Nazi socialism had nothing to do with stealing private property and ""nationalizing"" it like the commies do.  It had nothing to do with the vote buying schemes of Sanders and ""democratic"" socialists it was about making the economy healthy, whatever that entailed, hence the term ""socialism.""  The only reason America got to where it got was by copying most of their policies.   Unsurprisingly when you see left wingers get into power it leads to economic collapse and mass murder every time.

Whitney is privileged and rather selfish, but I think some of her often-shitty behavior stems from low self-esteem and  father issues that she got as a result of her parents’ divorce.

She saw her mother grovel and beg Noah to come back home, after he drop kicked her heart and left her and the kids for a younger woman. That would do a mind trick on the kids and Whitney specifically who was in her formative years as a young woman. I think that’s one of the reasons why she was clinging to Scotty and Furkat for such a long time.  On one hand she judged Helen for being pathetic, but her own self esteem issues prevented her from seeing her own self-worth as well.

Whitney obviously has father issues because of Noah. It is super depressing to know that your father is a bad person. Because I think prior to the divorce Whitney did respect Noah and consider him a good person and a good dad. I think it is realistic that Whitney would reflect on her parents’ marriage and relationships in the weeks leading up to her own wedding.  No kid wants to end up like their dysfunctional parents.

* Confessed to her lover that she was doing all this to ""become a god"" and the universe's sole ruler.
* Confessed to deliberately manipulating her own brother, making him emotionally dependent on her since they were children. 
* Confessed she knew Uldren had been Taken and made to kill his own people and free Riven, and did nothing about it.
* ...And immediately after got angry at the Guardian for killing him.
* ""\[Uldren\] killed our friend."" ""Yes, I'm sure you miss it.""  (B I T C H.)
* Refused to communicate with her people trapped in the Dreaming City, then when Ghost demanded she explain why, responded by guilt-tripping him. (""Everything I do is for a future that benefits you"" is *extremely* gaslighting.) 
* Two cycles later abandoned her people in the Dreaming City. After not going a single thing to help and knowing full well her presence was the only thing giving them hope.
* Dehumanizes Guardians and Ghosts (presumably for the simple reason they're things she cannot control.) 
* Gave the order to kill Riven then let Petra take the blame for the curse upon herself. (Also once exiled Petra for killing several Guardians by accident, despite the fact she's killed more Guardians.)
* Constantly claims that she's going all this to save the universe, but so far has done little more than kill people.

I'll give more thoughts if asked). Drax in Guardians 2 became kind of a one-note character. I thought Black Widow was badly written early on, but she's gotten much better the longer she's been in the MCU. The vast majority of the villains could've been MUCH better as well. (Come on, Marvel, you can and have done better than ""hero but bad.""); Loki and Thanos are the only ones with much in the way of real depth (disclaimer that I've not seen the latest Spiderman yet, so I know very little about Mysterio other than his status as a classic Spiderman villain). 

Tbh Marvel needs to take some lessons in compelling villains from Into the Spiderverse (where the only flaw of the characters was that some suffered a lack of screen time).

There are a myriad of issues that face this country. On the top of that list is immigration and healthcare. 

Immigration reform is not just ""progress for his base"", that is progress for the entire country. Emotions and silly ideologue aside, and this is a serious question, why can't your side ever come to terms with the fact that it needs to be addressed? 70% of legal immigrants are on one or more government programs. Each legal immigrant brings in 3.4 through chain migration. 30m illegal immigrants in the country. That's 70m in one generation from birthright citizenship. 35 TRILLION in debt. Some socialism is good but it only works when more people are contributing then taking out. It cannot be sustained. How is immigration reform ""progress for his base"". That is so silly. 

What exactly is the progress you're looking for? Obama esque corporatism and nepotism? The removal of ancient history from school curriculum in exchange for gender studies?

Just because things are not important for you does not mean they are not important. 

Let's remove that statement for a second though. This is the problem with modern America and politics. Not too long ago, people could disagree politically but there was a lot that united us. As a result, we were together as Americans. And, while we would voice our disagreement beforehand, when a president finally made his decision, politicians and people alike got behind that position to support it by believing their president made the right choice under the circumstances as that is why he was elected. Now, that last part is difficult and being realistic, I know it isn't going to happen. However, even if you did not vote for him, that is still YOUR president and to wish him to fail or to not care about the issues many Americans care about but YOU don't is not only selfish but overtly unAmerican. 

Realistically, even though I am not a liberal, I still care about what liberals care about. I know that a lot of young Americans and liberals want more socialist programs because they are stuck. They are either down on their luck or in incredible debt and the system is failing them. It is not failing me, but I am not stupid enough to think their issues don't matter or think about why they would vote for pseudo-communism just to get out of hard times. Progress with healthcare (which I think is heavily linked to immigration but that's besides the point) and other programs liberals find important ARE also important to me.

"f3h6gzy","The short answer is you can't be sure, so your safe bet is to not make one in my opinion.

It is nigh impossible to know what a tulpa will want and require for their personal health and happiness before they exist. This is always one of my strongest cautions to people entering tulpamancy is that this exact situation could occur, and as far as we have deliberated on the ethics; No, it would not be ethical to deny the tulpa what they want/need for their own health and happiness, even if it would include fronting or half time. That said, this is an extreme case, however it is also my case so I take it very much to heart when trying to warn prospective tulpamancers. You cannot know the extent of what your tulpa wants before you have them, and it is unethical to deny them their life experience if fronting/half time is what they require.

Again though, fairly extreme case... most tulpas seem partly fine with wonderlands or imposition, but there are also frequent stories of those who can't front who feel bereft of life experience, or those who would truly not be satisfied with a wonderland/imposition life.

I don't find you selfish, but just reasonable, and I applaud you for considering the ethics of this. No one 'wants' to live in a shared body, not the host, not the tulpa certainly, as it has realistic detriments of time sharing. This is, the first time in what feels like days, maybe weeks that I've gotten out for fronting and I'm already anxious because my time is almost up. There is a fundamental existential issue i deal with that I live the fraction of a normal singlet life. However, I cannot, and would not be satisfied with wonderland or imposition. Its only reasonable to guard your own time, because as of not, it is yours. But when you make the jump to have a tulpa? Well, then you're dealing with another sentient entity that also has a right to life, and frankly upon that clause your sole ownership of time and body are surrendered.

Perhaps I'm being harsh though. I'm rather well aware that my case is a outlier, and I envy those that seem satisfied otherwise. You can probably still make a tulpa, but it just has to be with certain ground rules about the 'no fronting' and 'no half time'. And maybe with some flexibility down the line. One strong rationalization you can use with your tulpa is that you take care of responsibilities for your general life, so you deserve more fronting time in that sense. All I can ask is you communicate with your tulpa and try to work with them as much as you can so you both can be comfortable. This is another life we are speaking of, and you are the one voluntarily creating it. They shouldn't have to be restrained at your convenience basically. That said, most will be quite satisfied without fronting/half-time (but perhaps think ahead about how you will handle these situations should they arise).",1570919623,"i don't find you selfish, but just reasonable, and i applaud you for considering the ethics of this.","selfish, but just","selfish","but",TRUE,"selfish , but just reasonable","reasonable",NA,"just",1

It wasn't until the age of Plinkett where people started to truly hate the prequels, or claim they do at least. There's a lot of love for Revenge Of The Sith, and a lot of the love for the lore and visual effects in the prequels.

""and it's uncalled for now.""

You're a fucking idiot, I'm gonna be very mean here because you honestly deserve this. It is completely justified for fans to be pissed off at Rian Johnson and Kathleen Kennedy for The Last Jedi because THEY INSULTED FANS FIRST BEFORE THE MOVIE CAME OUT.

I need to say that again THEY INSULTED FANS FIRST BEFORE THE MOVIE CAME OUT. Being pissed off at them for making a movie to insult older fans in the hopes of appealing to new imaginary fans is COMPLETELY FUCKING JUSTIFIED.

""I say again, if you don't like a star wars movie, just don't watch it. Let the rest of us enjoy it.""

Fuck you. Fuck you and this bullshit attitude. For many people Star Wars has been a part of their lives for decades. You can't just tell them to just ""don't watch it,"" or ignore it. That would be like telling a parent to just ""ignore them if you don't like what they're doing,"" if their kid becomes a stripper. No. You can't just tell people to just forget about decades of investment in something because you are a bit irritated at them expressing their displeasure. To even ask that of someone is just stupid and selfish.

But, here's the punchline to your comment: ""Let the rest of us enjoy it.""

Most people aren't enjoying it. Chinese fans, for instance, hated the movie. In fact, most people who have little to no investment in Star Wars don't like the film. People AREN'T enjoying the movie, and only Star Wars fans seem to care about it at all.

In fact, the screaming fans you hear are the only ones supporting Star Wars now. The majority of people who saw the movie and didn't like it did leave to ""Let the rest of us enjoy it,"" and do you know what happened? The toys didn't sell, and the movie after The Last Jedi was a commercial failure. The Last Jedi turned off old fans, and didn't appeal to new fans. It was a complete failure.

I'm a senior in high school right now and I'm trying really hard to save up for college. I run a pretty popular art instagram page and regularly do commissions and make good income from there. Sometimes I'll post a pic of a piece I did of or for some of my \*best friends\* and say something like ""This is a gift for my best friend \_\_\_\_\_\_. I love them so much....etc."" So yes, I do give discounts to friends and if I want to, I'll do drawings for free for my best friends. An important thing to remember is that these free drawings are because I \*want\* to do them and I feel inspired. They aren't commissions. 

So my aunt on my mother's side just had a new baby recently. She knows that I do a lot of art and take commissions. She reached out and requested a painting of her new born that is ""super realistic."" She wanted 18""x24"", which is quite big and requested that it'd be oil paint and not acrylic because acrylic ""looks cheaper."" I reluctantly agreed and told her that's going to be $300. She replied with, ""That's the discount price??"" I responded truthfully and said no, that's the full price and that I only give discounts to my friends who are students. She sent me a long message saying that the price was ridiculous and that she can't afford it. She also went on to say that I should do it for FREE since she was my family and that I ""wasn't even a professional"" and should be charging less than $50 for it. Finally she said that this was my cousin and that I was disrespecting her by being so selfish and heartless. This pissed me off because she obviously understands nothing about art and the amount of work that goes into it. I flat out refused her. I said that she can reach out again when she can pay the full price or I'm not doing it. 

Later, my mom gets angry at me because apparently my aunt called her berating her for raising me to be a ""money-hungry brat."" My mom basically told me to just do it for her and give it to her for free and to not spend a lot of time on it. I still said no. My mom was a bit angry and said that I was being selfish but she ultimately told me to deal with my aunt myself and to apologize to her at least. I'm still standing my ground. What do you guys think?

Communism and socialism are about public, common ownership of the means of production, and a society based on fulfilling social need and social betterment. Your beliefs about the inherent selfishness of humans seems natural to you because you were born and raised in a capitalist society that tells you (and all of us) that humans are naturally selfish.

“**AHEM!”** The paw fruit user coughed into his clenched fist in an intentionally loud manner, snapping the young boy our of his stupidity. Immediately, a small blush started to creep up onto him, turning his cheeks a rosy pink.

He constantly does things for his own benefit and when called out on it says it’s because he “obviously superior to everyone else”. I’ve called him out on being egotistical and selfish but he exclaims that this behavior is caused by his anxiety and depression. My brother can be a dickwad sometimes and also selfish but never to the extreme that his friend is. I hate to say it but I hate his friend with a raging passion. 

The only reason I feel bad about it is because on the rare occasion he can be nice (for example this morning he drove me to work so I wouldn’t have to walk). However he just pissed me off by walking into my room at 12 at night and sitting on my already broken bed and refusing to move.  He is a rather large person so I was worried about my bed breaking even more as my paycheck isn’t large enough to pay for another. My mother and my brother accompanied him and they all came into my small room and laughed as I pleaded with them all to get out. My brother began tossing my stuff around and messing up my newly cleaned room. Now, admittedly, I have some anger issues and after a while of asking I started to raise my voice. I yelled at them all and cussed at them until they all finally left. I was called a bitch afterwards for overreacting when they weren’t doing anything that they considered bothersome while in my room. Now I’ve been called sensitive for getting bothered at this stuff and my family says that, because I’m so sensitive, I’m very fun to bother and annoy. I hate feeling like my emotions don’t matter if I get annoyed while everyone else is amused. I very much like my privacy and I don’t like people coming into space that I’ve deemed safe for myself. So, to sum up this long rant, am I the asshole for yelling and swearing at all of them and for despising my brother’s friend.

"evppaau","Thank you, CodyWakesUpScreaming and blamecanadaeh! You took the words right out of my mouth.

But let's be honest. In SC, with original female characters, it matters a great deal if they are both cool and gorgeous.

Weird fetish? What do you know about me? Do you know if I am a white man, a black man, a white woman? But your ""by default"" assumption was correct. I'm a white guy and I do think that black women are beautiful so I took pleasure trying to create a character that could fit as an original character (I also have a lot of characters, some white, some with impossible colors), and I was curious about other people opinions. Maybe, if you think women with brown hair are beautiful, most of your female creations will have brown hair, but you probably won't come here asking which one would make the best fit, since there is already Xianghua and Seong Mi-Na. Maybe you could do the same for women with purple hair. I'm sure nobody will be triggered or think that you are trying to impose quota on SC. 

I do not intend to complain to SC or in this reddit page about the lack of black female character. As other people said, I juste stated a fact about the lack of original black female character in the game. But you look like the kind of person who get really triggered as soon as someone talk about representation and inclusiveness. I wasn't even trying to play this card but my impression is that when you think something is about representation and inclusiveness, you can't put thinks into perspectives or think straight, so I do not intend to argue all day about it.

But I happen to believe that psychologically, for minorities, representation matter. We aren't all white guys who grew up seeing white male heros everywhere in every fictions, so who are you that state that reprensentation doesn't matter? Your argument against representativeness seem pretty immature and selfish. But I won't try to convince you. I'm sure it would be a waste of time.

And before you lose your mind on this, I don't think I was helping black women to feel represented by posting some of my characters this reddit page. Like I said, I wasn't playing this card.

"eud8flb","As far as I am aware, in Christianity, which...again I have to say, I think there are several versions depending on which denomination I guess, but generally the story goes on about how Lucifer became vain and selfish, which I guess another person can say ""well isn't god selfish"" but there's a lot to consider that isn't just black and white in that regard.

In any case, the story of Lucifer rebelling started with him pretty much giving in to several sins, considering himself to be incredibly beautiful, smart, obsessing with his power, and wanting a higher position even though he was, I think, the angel who sat right next to god? What he tried to do was take God's position for his own desires. I can understand wanting to be equal, but as far as I'm aware, he did it because of selfish reasons instead of more proper reasons. So in turn, Lucifer is considered the origin of sin I believe, because it was he who committed the first sin, and it corrupted him. That first sin was pride that he himself created. I believe that is why he was cast down from heaven, as he was no longer fit to be an angel after, if memory serves, he tried to rebel against god and even convinced some other angels to be on his side, which then he was cast down to the earth.
There are some passages that give a mixed message, saying Lucifer still had access to heaven but never returned, and others saying he was permanently forbidden access to heaven once he was cast down.

So the long short of the story is that Lucifer saw himself as more beautiful, smarter, better than god and desired his position, tried to overthrow god, and for his insurrection was cast down as punishment which probably hurt his pride a lot because he was very close to god, and I think he was even considered one of his most trusted, or favorite angels.

I believe you can actually look up some stories on how he convinced other angels to join his rebellion, granted different books, old testament, new testament, and others might have a different version or reading of it, but he did rebel against god in Christianity.

As for the devil punishing the wicked, another thing if I am to be remembering correctly, because I don't want to quote something as one to one, but I believe that the devil isn't in charge of hell. I think God controls hell, and its purpose wasn't originally meant for people. It was originally created for Lucifer and the angels that sided with him when he was cast down from heaven. From another article I am reading at the moment because I was interested in looking it up, it seems as though the devil tempts people into committing sin so they end up being sent to hell, because he doesn't want to go there alone. I'm not sure if that's a sad thing as in he doesn't want to be alone, or that he's just too proud and doesn't want to feel like the worst person there, so he tempts other people to give him self a more elated feeling as his own petty way of condemning others for his own sense of power or desire to trap other people in his own bad situation. And as this article says, and many other excerpts from biblical text, the devil isn't red with a pointy tail and a pitchfork, he was an angel of light who was beautiful in so many ways.
I don't know what to do about posting sources, but the source for this was actually made by a user named Drake_Windsor in response to a question about why the devil punished evil people in hell.

It's also an interesting note to mention that the way people saw angels on earth is drastically different from depictions of how we draw them. They're beings of light, but in every interaction between people and angels as far as I remember has the humans screaming or panicking because the angels look like monsters, which sounds a bit ironic, doesn't it? But they're not dangerous, they just look very different from what a human would ever imagine an angelic being, well, being. They have to warn before they ever appear, or after they appear, ""Do not be afraid""
I just thought that was an interesting tidbit of info, to whatever truth there might be to that. but try looking up what angels really look like some time. It's very interesting, and the interactions are somewhat humorous with how some people have described them in their own way to joke.

I can always look up more proper info on these if you ever actually want to discuss this sort of thing, and my mother I believe majored in religious studies so she would be able to give some thoughtful advice towards this.

Just as a disclaimer because I don't want you to think I have any bias when talking about God or Christianity, even though I am Christian, I try to remain neutral about it and I really don't want to impose what I believe. I believe everyone has a right to their religion, and if someone wants to switch to another religion, that's good because it's their own choice and forcing a conversion isn't natural. In the end, whatever you believe in, and whoever you are, in my eyes the God I believe in will give everyone a chance after death to make their own decision, and be compassionate. What I wrote is what I just recall from growing up hearing about these things in the bible, and from a mother and father who were raised Christian. My mother is more open and conversational about it, so it makes it fun to pose her questions, and she doesn't look down on me when I want to question thing within' our religion, because seeking knowledge and understanding of a story for its legitimacy, origins, and lessons is important, and what they might mean and how other people interpret them and put them to use.

"etv9ykj","""Web Weirdos"" was definitely an episode that wasn't very enjoyable to watch, but not really the worst one I've seen so far. The episode started off pretty well, Finn and Jake doing stupid stuff and suffering the consequences. The joke few jokes in the first minutes like Finn's extremely long fingernails were disgusting and funny. But as the episode went on, the main plot of this episode just felt like it was being underused. The plot of Ed and Barb could totally be used to help Finn consider his current relationship. I'm gonna go on a side tangent here. The designs for the spiders were really bad. I'm guessing the character designs looked like ""big"" spiders because then they would seem less intimidating, but if they based a design off a real spider, and just made us relate to them because of their personalities, I think it would make for a cooler episode. Clearly the gross-out humor wasn't left in the dust in this episode, so why not go all out? The bird gag felt like filler in this episode, and the time taken with that joke could've been filled with more development of Ed. Barb's reasoning for the sword doesn't make much sense to me? Like she immediately defaults to ""this gift was for you"", when previously we had no sense that Ed was the kind of person to get the sword for himself. We could have easily have had some context to Ed, maybe he was adventurous and selfish, but the few scenes we had with him didn't really establish that well. In the scene that he *gets the sword itself* it even seems like he had full intention of making her happy.  After that, Barb decides to **EAT** Ed?????? And then begins to beat him in a scene that just went on for way too long. To finish, Barb giving birth was something I didn't expect from this type of episode, and also something I just didn't want to see, but okay, here we are. With ALL of this being said, about how much I didn't understand the episode, I still think that many people could still relate to this episode. It did cover some marriage issues, but I feel like the way it was executed wasn't very good, and a lot of moments that could further relate this episode to both kids and adults were left underutilized.

Before watching ""Dream of Love"", I struggled to remember a lot of the episode, I think everyone will remember the song, and then Mr. Pig and Treetrunks kissing for a very long time. After watching the episode, it honestly felt like that really is all you need to know about the episode. The song takes up two minutes of this episode and did a really great job at tieing TT's and Mr. Pig's relationship together, but when the rest of the episode just felt like exposition to this song and nothing else, it leaves you with barely anything to remember for this episode, hence why I'm keeping this review really short.",1563229968,"we could have easily have had some context to ed, maybe he was adventurous and selfish, but the few scenes we had with him didn't really establish that well.","adventurous and selfish","selfish",NA,FALSE,"adventurous and selfish","adventurous",NA,NA,0

Initially at 23, although we lived together, we did low contact at first, small talk, the weather etc. When I had to take care of my Nan over in Europe, we started talking everyday and it was nice. It's still nice, until this pops up.  I know that what she's doing is not okay, but way back I decided it would hurt more to not have her at all. 

But I'm back to thinking that a slow burn back to low contact may be for the best, at least right now. 

I know that someone said above shes not changed and she's still awful if she acts this way. And while I agree she is awful and selfish, but as product of a shitty abusive, environment and as a now senior woman stubborn as a pig in mud she has changed a great deal. Just not enough. I know its probably hard for anyone to imagine after what I wrote, but she was genuinely way worse than this 20ish years ago. 

She went from a raised strict  Roman Catholic, homophobic, racist, denier of the existence mental health issues and science and medicine, believer in tough love and hitting your kids to the literal polar opposite. The only thing she didn't voluntarily change on her own was I convinced her hitting doesn't work so Sibling would never get a slap. Once she/we got away from our family home country she saw a better way.

She is now so open minded, ashamed of how she used to be, but is also aware that where and how she was raised made it a learnt behavior. She's come at about 75% of a total 180.

"emhehj9","I was diagnosed with endo two and a half years ago after surgery, similar situation in that I had an idea what was causing such immense pain but no doctor would talk about it as the primary suspect (they figured it was a hernia and that's how the story went until the surgery results).

I'm so sorry. I too wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy. I remember telling my partner at the time in hospital room, tears pouring out. He held my hand, looked at me and said 'It's ok, we can have dogs.' which made me laugh and cry more. It hurts so much, and it's so hard to put into words all the thoughts and feelings that rush through. 

I was 24 then. The post-surgery follow up conversation with the doctor was horrible, to say the least. I'm still a bit shell shocked and haven't talked to a medical professional about it since. I was pushed onto a hormonal treatment that has very much changed my body and my general mental health. 

Worse than that though were the conversations with my family. It took them an inexcusable amount of time to understand that they need to back off on the subject of pregnancy as a necessary part of a woman's life. I remember the first time I broke the news to my sister, she replied with 'But you have to have kids, who are my kids going to play with?' 

I can't tell you what will make you feel better, or where exactly to go from here. That's for you to decide and discover. But I will give you two pieces of advice.

First, search online for a known endometriosis specialist near you and request for them to look at your case. Even if you decide for your own reasons that you don't want to go through a pregnancy, endometriosis poses other problems that tend to get worse over time. You'll want someone to listen to you, someone who will respect your choices and advice on the best medical procedures available. You do not want someone who will push an easy-for-them solution. You might need to visit multiple doctors, but trust me it's better to do it now. Don't give up!

Second, prepare yourself now for the insensitivity of others. It sounds stupid and selfish, but the responses I've received from the people I care about most when talking about the probability of me not having kids is way more stupid and selfish. I've grown a thick skin, but there's been a few nights where I've gone to bed not talking to anyone over it. It hurts. It hurts more than the physical pain or the idea of living a life without kids (which I've come to accept as ok and it's helped me). It hurts to be ignored and talked over and told to change your attitude towards something only you are experiencing. So, confide in your husband, grow that trust and believe he will stand behind you and stand up for you when you need that support. 

You will feel alone but try ro remember that you're not. If you need someone to talk to more, feel free to DM me.",1556975735,"it sounds stupid and selfish, but the responses i've received from the people i care about most when talking about the probability of me not having kids is way more stupid and selfish.","stupid and selfish","selfish",NA,FALSE,"stupid and selfish","stupid",NA,NA,0

"em0shfi","&gt; – If you vote for a policy that does not directly benefit you, because you feel empathy for other people, it also counts as satisfying your own interest: you are voting for what makes you feel better.

This would most definitely hold true under a useless definition of selfishness. (Though I'm not sure if you are using such a definition.)

If every action that satisfies you **in any imaginable way**, counts as selfish and only selfish, then every single action you have ever committed is selfish. Even in dilemmas we must make the choice that we perceive as the least evil, or harms our interests the least. To claim that every satisfying decision or least dissatisfying decision, is selfish... makes the idea of selfishness entirely redundant.

Charitable monetary decisions come at financial expense but with tangible rewards for others, and the sense of satisfaction in the charitable. It is strange to define such actions as selfish and (seemingly) completely ignore the fact that it benefits others.

As such we ought not to consider these to be mutually exclusive. Any action can be selfish *and* selfless.

If collective interest is your interest (i.e. your moral compass points you towards collective benefit), does that make you selfish? If we would seriously bother to call this selfish then this is a redundant description still. It's very easy for any decision to be selfish but it takes more for any decision to be selfless.",1556497586,"if every action that satisfies you **in any imaginable way**, counts as selfish and only selfish, then every single action you have ever committed is selfish.","selfish and only","selfish",NA,FALSE,"selfish and only","only",NA,NA,1

"ekpy6uw","Household wealth matters because you claimed that ""teachers are among the top ten professions with the most millionaires."" That statement implies that teachers are the ones making the money, not household wealth. That's not your fault but more the fault of the article author who is trying to sensationalize the study.

Also, I didn't claim that teachers were only wealthy because of their spouses. I was only referring to what the article said. The problem is that for most professions - not just teaching, accruing wealth comes at a cost of other luxuries that people with higher paying jobs can benefit from. I am accruing wealth even when I am making less than the state minimum as a teacher. But that is solely because I am busting my ass at 3 jobs so that I can pay down all of my debt and build my portfolio. It is a little short-sighted to claim that teachers can build their wealth only on the salaries that they are given. I'd be in the red financially if I was solely dependent on my teaching salary. Granted it is only anecdotal, but I haven't met many teachers that didn't have a side-job or two to make extra money and make ends meet. Those that didn't always seemed to have a spouse that could make up the difference or had generous parents that assisted them. 

The fact is that the millennial generation is set to become the first generation poised to have a worse quality of life than their parents. The economy has been set up to benefit the wealthy and keep the working class from obtaining the same success that has been possible for previous generations. The only reason I say this is that if nothing is done now, it is only going to get worse and it has to start somewhere. The GOP likes to vilify any group that wants to protest current status quo or ruffle feathers. Why? Because status quo is good for their base. The wealthy get to keep their money while the rest of us argue us instead of focusing our concern on the fact that they get away with essentially robbing us (yes, I understand the irony in that statement). What's more atrocious than just vilifying them is to mis-portray what we want. Pay isn't our central point. General education spending is lacking and student needs aren't being met, and simply can't be met in their entirety with the resources given to us. Do I want more pay? Yes, but who doesn't? I'd settle though for more planning time, reduced class sizes, more control on classroom spending, reducing the amount of standardized testing, more mental health resources for students, and the list goes on. That's what we want. The GOP wants everyone to think we want more pay so they can tout their recent raises and make teachers look greedy and selfish, but pay is just a slice of a much larger cake. That's also ignoring how they calculate their raises, which skews the data.",1555081115,"the gop wants everyone to think we want more pay so they can tout their recent raises and make teachers look greedy and selfish, but pay is just a slice of a much larger cake.","greedy and selfish","selfish",NA,FALSE,"greedy and selfish","greedy",NA,NA,0

One guy left - i think out of hurt pride and shame and a need to respect himself and never wanting to risk that again. He divorced, hasnt remarried or lived with anyone else in ten years, but has built a solid co-parenting relationship with the ex. I dont think he could have let go of the shame and anger and disgust brought on by her infidelity but if he could have, i think his life might be better today than it is. much of what he was building with her could have still been built, the home life and retirement plans, shared lives and family togetherness. his wife is kind of a loose cannon too and i think when the cheating came out she harbored no hope at all that he would stay and maybe even thought she didnt deserve him. i think she continually is reminded since then what a great guy he is and has hated herself ever since for breaking their marriage, and has had to bury that anger. meanwhile the guy i think has struggled to understand how she could have betrayed him and buries his self doubt about whether he was a good enough husband.

The other guy i know stayed, though he clearly also felt the public shame and anger. everyone knew. the wife had moved in with her exboyfriend from before the marriage. but somehow husband kept communicating and described the cheating as her decision ('she decided to go a different way' were his words for it) and though making clear she had a choice to make - he somehow left open the door for her.

"eedynqv","NTA.

First, you're being selfish.  In a good way.  You have to look out for yourself because only you will do the best job of that.  This is proper selfishness.  Like, if your friend kept hitting you up for money and you refused to give it to her, that would also be selfish but appropriate.  You are cutting a negative influence out of your life who will not provide you with any benefits.  You are not a charity.  You are not the pope or the church.  You are not jesus.  You are an individual with a limited amount of time and energy, and you need to be advancing yourself, not allowing deadweight to drag you down.

Second, you are going through a process we all do.  ""Friends"" are rarely friends forever.  Childhood friends rarely last.  If you're still friends with someone from childhood, it should be because you're both wonderful people who make each other better.  She changed.  She chose to do drugs.  She chose to ruin her life.  She chose to get pregnant and have the child.  She chose to neglect her child.  She made all of the decisions and you have no obligation to even think of her.  She changed from how she was as a child, and whenever there is such a drastic change you need to look and see if the person is going to be a good friend for you to have.  She is not.  She is an anchor that she is trying to hook onto your neck and drag you down.

Your outlook is healthy, appropriate, and will serve you well.  It is not your job to save others.  And, speaking as someone who has tried to save others in the past, YOU CAN'T DO IT.  People do not change.  And they certainly aren't going to change just because you're a shining positive influence.  After all, you guys have already drifted apart.  If you were to somehow grab her shoulders, shake her, and yell at her all the terrible things she is doing to her life, she would just ignore you.  The ONLY friend I was ever able to ""turn around"" was a person who, at the moment I screamed at them that stuff, we were great friends already.  It was only because we were so close at that moment that he was able to hear my words.

"ed2n56c","If the Palestinians had the power to protect themselves I wouldn't blame them for doing so. 

 The problem I have with Palestinian violence (at least Gaza and Hamas) is it doesn't seem constructive.  Hamas stockpiles rockets, attacks Israel, then puts as many civilians in harms way. 
 Its not in their best interest to launch rockets at Israel but it does help the leaders.  Israel blockading Gaza helps keep Israel safe (at a great cost to Gaza), I see that as potentially wrong and selfish but not corrupt.  Palestinian casualties are used to gain donations and prestige for leadership. So I view the two differently.

Israel developing the Iron Dome and implementing security measures means there really isn't much pressure on Israel from attacks.   The status quo is actually pretty safe for them and there isn't much security to be gained at negotiations.  

   

&gt;But I would argue that ""collective punishment"" (or pick a more neutral term, I can't think of any) as implemented in Gaza provides moral justification for Palestinians to use violence against Israeli civilians. 

Killing Israeli civilians doesn't make Palestinians safe.  Blockading Gaza makes Israel safer (at least medium term).  That's the difference between the two.  Its why ""punishment"" might not be 
a great word here.  Its preventative for Israel while punishment is more broad. Israel doesn't have to care about punishing just about stopping/mitigating future attacks. 

I get attacking someone who does someone bad to you but as a 3rd party I can't condone it and again I think its harmful.    

&gt;it also makes it impossible for a large portion of the world to support Israel. 

Its more about the money/influence that you gain with nations who hate Israel.  The response is wildly disproportional if were are just talking injustice.  I'd say only parts of Europe have a problem with Israel for moral reasons.

That is not true. The vast majority of people act unselfishly from time to time. Humns are not that one sided.

If we live in a town of 5 millions the chance of everyone running to help is lower.

When we tear his private life apart, we  find no special deals or contracts written in blood, which rules out a deal with the devil or a deal with gamblers that have bet on such a proposition. This means that he's not holding back for the sake of the streak: he really isn't worth more than 1 hit per game. So we no longer see him as selfish, but just weird and a little creepy. (His wife discloses that they quit playing the lottery because they could never do better that ""Free Play"".)

In the beginning the manager leaves him in in hopes that he will do more, but he's slow on the basepaths and averages a fielding error per game, so the manager learns to pinch run for him as soon as he reaches first.

As for luck, I'd say that that early on he'd be viewed as lucky (he's clearly not that good) but when it starts to get really stupid (say, 100 games) everyone would begin to conclude that the streak is happening because

a) they have to be living in a fictional universe for this to happen, in which case it's not that special, or

b) there is something about the player that allows him to manage 1 and only 1 hit per game, so it must be some kind of skill which analysts will eventually explain

The manager eventually recognizes his value and pinch hits him in high leverage situations. He comes through, naturally, and they win more games than projected and make the playoffs. But the team can't put enough men on base and they lose in the LCS.

Is this good for baseball? No: there will be a short term spike among casual fans (the novelty of the streak will probably fill the seats of every game for his team) but in the long term it would diminish baseball. The casual fans would lose interest after the first month of the next season when no crazy statistical anomaly emerges.

"eacomdl","The spoilers to key plot lines is one of the most insulting things about the BH/KJA prequels, imo.

It's one thing to make the decision to create more works in the world of Dune. I and many others find it tasteless and selfish, but there's plenty of fans too who just want more content no matter who gets to write it and who gets to decide who writes it.

But to knowingly undercut the emotional impact and resonance of major moments in the original series is petty, childish, and flat out stupid. They know damn well that some people will read in chronological order, and thus they are fundamentally changing the relationship people will have with the original works.

Some minor choices I could have forgiven. The changing of some details to enable more ""exciting"" prequels, the liberal interpretations of  the structure of the Dune Universe, I can understand those things. They want to sell books, they want to present a certain type of J.J. Abrhams style light Action Adventure Sci-Fi they feel will appeal to the modern palate.

But the complete obliviousness and/or lack of respect for the amount of work Frank put into setting up payoffs later in the series is truly disgraceful, imo.

Specifically:

&gt;!Casually revealing that the Axilotle Tanks are in fact human women is an astonishingly bad decision. It's probably the most shocking reveal in the entire series as it slowly plays out in the original books. You're left hints here and there leading you to suspect it, but when Duncan finally consciously acknowledges it, the reader shares that horrifying moment of realization and digestion with him. It's a secret held close in a series that otherwise volunteers much of what other authors would try to leverage as little surprises. It stands above petty personal secrets because it is so central to the themes of the story. It's about the horrific ways humans treat each other when given the justification of authority to do so, and sets up the events after God Emporer when humans must face that grotesque reflection of their actions in the Honored Matres. To see it presented as a sort of minor ""twist"" in just another \~zany prequel adventure\~ is what loses BH/KJA all respect and credibility as authors to me, and it's why I consider their work glorified fan fiction. It's not worthy of being cannon, and it's not part of my 'headcannon'.!&lt;

My advise would be read the original six Frank Herbert books first. Then if you can't come to acceptance with that ending, go ahead and give Hunters and Sandworms a shot.

"e8jolb8","The “selfish” one is still bugging me. I grew up so confused about myself. If is ever misbehaved in the slightest, she’d say all the things she does for me (later I learned these are the bare minimum parental duties), and that I was so ungrateful and selfish. I didn’t feel selfish. But apparently I was (not).

I really have that selfish idea embedded into my head. For example, I was in my therapy session and thought I was taking too long to understand what my therapist was asking me to do. I said, “I’m sorry to be wasting your time.” He looked shocked and I realized that was a crazy thing to say. I am paying for that time. There is no possible way that I could be wasting it. 

The idea that I am selfish is absolutely, objectively untrue. I have “proof”. I have let people I barely know sleep on my couch until they could afford an apartment. I foster the dogs that no one else will bring into their homes. I give away my professional services to silent auction fundraisers all the time (I’ve literally never said no to an organization that’s asked). I donate cash to the local YWCA. I volunteer my time to work with 4H kids. Back when I was starting out, as an adult, I went hungry many days so that my dogs could have the vet care they deserve. These are not the actions of a selfish person. 

The times I really feel selfish are when i absolutely should not feel selfish. I broke up with a guy for not being the right fit. I thought to myself, “well he hasn’t done anything wrong. I’m being selfish and picky. He doesn’t deserve to be broken up with.” But that is absolutely insane. You don’t stay with someone because they haven’t anything wrong, you stay with someone because they are the right person. Right now, I’m feeling selfish because the foster dog I brought home wants to eat my cat. I told the organization that the dog can only stay here long enough to find a new foster home. Look at that! I’m not kicking this dog to the curb! I’m putting up a bunch of inconvenient safety measures in my home to keep my cat safe while this dog finds another safe place to stay. How is that selfish? And yet, I feel like I’m selfish for asking the organization to find a new home for this dog. 

Of course I said I was “too selfish” to want to be a mother at 17 years old! 17 year olds are a little selfish, and they usually don’t want kids. But she has told me that I’m so selfish my entire life! The truth is that I simply don’t want to be a mother, and I believe that children should be wanted. That’s enough reason all on it’s own and I don’t need to explain my choice to stay child free to anyone. She loves to say “you’ll understand when you’re a mother.” It’s such a great way to excuse her behavior because I don’t know what it’s like to be a mother. She’s always trying to get me to have kids. Ugh. I need to be done with her. No more of this low contact BS.

Given everything you've said and all the work you've done, I still don't believe it's impossible, just a matter of extreme difficulty. 

I really don't mean this to sound condescending or naive or anything, seriously; I believe in science and the scientific method but I'm just not sure how reliably attraction and love can be calculated. 

Like me, I was lucky enough to get into a serious relationship at age 15. I am 30 now. I only had one girlfriend ever, and that girlfriend became my wife. From my relationship experience, falling in love can just be infatuation, it can be superficial and physical and selfish; but actually loving someone, that's very different. Okay, and I'm only talking from personal experience here. 

When you love someone you're able to overlook and accept their faults. You don't measure them up to a standard and judge them accordingly, you mold your standard around them. I'm a flawed person, my wife is a flawed person, but unless our flaws became truly and intolerably destructive to each other we wouldn't break. And yeah, this might sound like bullshit to you, but loving someone means putting their needs above your own. How attractive they are becomes a side note. 

Yeah, women are different from men in many ways but we're both still human, and how they experience love isn't really different from how we do. Would you completely disqualify a woman because of her appearance? Sure, maybe there are extreme limits but I mean, c'mon, fooking Shrek was a movie. People were not leaving the movie theater outraged and incredulous during Shrek, I was there man, in 2001. 

That one relationship I described, it's someone I know personally. I don't have a cornucopia of examples but this woman told me specifically she bagged this guy because of how he treated her, and because she knew he really cared, when many of the people she knew were fake. He's much older than her, and he has some serious health problems. She's not the standard for all women or anything but shit, it's not completely impossible. 

I don't know, you're right I'm all anecdotes, and I wish I had something more reliable to throw at you. I really understand if you've tried your best and want to give up now. Weariness is more deadly than momentary desperation.

&gt; I disagree with the first statement however. Capital absolutely abuses labor, and it has to. A rich man like Jeff Benzos doesn't get rich through fair treatment. No billionaire is innocent in his money making. Rockefeller and Morgan are terrible, dirty men who made their money off broken backs.

So there’s a old C.S Lewis quote here that comes to mind, which is “Of all tyrannies, a tyranny sincerely exercised for the good of its victims may be the most oppressive. It would be better to live under robber barons than under omnipotent moral busybodies. The robber baron's cruelty may sometimes sleep, his cupidity may at some point be satiated; but those who torment us for our own good will torment us without end for they do so with the approval of their own conscience.”  

In response to your point about the robber barons of the late 19th Century, I think it’s important to note that the institutional framework of the American economy today is *much* better today than it was then. Even if we do come to an agreement that the treatment of amazon workers outweighs social benefits amazon provides (jobs ,both through amazon directly and also jobs downstream,  the social benefits of being able to easily order goods from home etc) to my mind it seems like the obvious solution is passing legislation that givens workers more bargaining power is the route to go. Using this as motivation to throw out the concept of private capital strikes me as throwing out the baby with the bath water.

&gt;I believe in the hearts of men who would do labor for the good of their families and their friends. Materialistic value creates greed and the incoming selfishness to have more of it. I don't doubt that it works with those who are naturally selfish, but materialistic work only breeds a toxic society.

So here is the usual idea that the society of the Cash Nexus reduces people to prostitution, that people working for wages and wages alone was bad. Usually, people when making this point are calling for a society where people view their jobs as a way to serve their fellow man. My problem with that is that I can’t think of a single example of a society trying to base itself  on such a principle being successful. I don’t doubt that many of the original communists came to their views out of a position out of a sincere desire to help their fellow man. However, it seems like such efforts inevitably end in despotism in which the people are ground under the heel of the state in order for the “greater good”. 

Can you point to any communist societies that have been successful? I understand that communism exists in more forms than the simple command economies of the USSR and China, but I believe other varieties of communism are likely to run into the same problems.

Furthermore I think the great problem is that in a capitalist/ market economy there is no reason why people can’t jobs that fulfill them. Most people who oppose communism are for a market economy, not a market society. A lot of my ideas here [comes from this](http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2013/05/understanding-karl-marx-hoisted-from-the-archives-from-four-years-ago-may-day-weblogging.html) which if you’ve got the time I’d recommend you take a look at. 

My comment is already fairly lengthy, following this I’m going to try to be more concise so if I miss anything important in your comment I’m sorry!

&gt; I don't think Trump is a fascist either. He has some traits of one, but just seems more like a vain narcissist. I was leaning more to the idea of how fascism is being normalized. I've seen multiple Republican supporters be absolutely fine if Trump ruled indefinitely, or began purging leftists on the streets. Groups like the Proud Boys can beat up people freely while the police only stare at them. Even going to Europe, fascism in Germany is booming at the moment due to the refugee crisis. They're growing steadily.

I think that the normalization of Fascism is fairly overstated and comes from the nastiest voice on both sides always being the loudest. There certainly is a worry about Trumps effect on institutions. The biggest problem here is the internet and diversification of the media which leads to echo chambers which helps create an ultra partisan atmosphere. Honestly I don’t have a solution here.

I didn’t know who the proud boys are, but I looked them up and [NYPD is looking to charge 9 of their members](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.nytimes.com/2018/10/15/nyregion/proud-boys-nypd.amp.html) which is a good thing.

I view the current populist time we’re living in as a combination of nativist fears (which we’ve gone through before, the backlash against Irish immigrants comes to mind) and struggles with technological change and its effect on workers. This was compounded by the financial crisis, I’m hopeful this wave of populism will dissipate the way others have before it. (This goes for both populism on the left and the right)

&gt; For Antifa, I see people fighting back against a country who had let right-wing terrorists do anything they want for years. It makes the alt-right afraid again, as it should. You can't debate someone who's only language is violence. Even Richard Spencer is afraid of doing more lectures. But I do agree, violence does not help our image - I wish we could see more Antifa activists engaging in charity work or helping the homeless instead of fighting.

I would love to see Antifa engaging in charity (we all should do more!) It seems to me that violence is just counter productive. It stoops down to their level and creates sympathy for those you’re trying to oppose. 

&gt;Don't worry, I didn't assume you called me a thug. :) I've heard about ""just vote"" all the time, but that thought diminishes every year for me. The rich get richer and they got plenty of money to sway the politicians that could've made a difference. Even people like Martin Luther King Jr. understood this - you cannot win without some sort of violence. Malcom X was right in that regard. He got the vote and was allowed to sit wherever he wished, but it didn't stop systematic racism from alienating his brothers and sisters and isolating them. The state cannot be conquered and won with votes. If that were true, we wouldn't still be in decline.

Did King advocate for violence? My knowledge is the Civil Rights Movement isn’t what it should be, but I was under the impression that King  resisted calls to violence of any kind.

&gt; Honestly haven't given the most in-depth look at Locke's liberalism, I may take a look. Regrettably, there has been failed concepts of communism. I won't deny it. There are multiple versions of communism however, some better then others. I recommend taking a look at some communism debate subreddits, they're very open to viewpoints and helped me see the world how I do today. I think r/LateStageCapitalism has some links in the sidebar.

Check it out, it’s the ideology that best defines modern western civilization! As a Philosopher he’s probably one of my favorites. I’m highly skeptical(and that’s probably understating it) about the alternate versions of communism advocated on those subreddits. But in the interest of maintaining civil discourse and open minded debate I’ll give it a look.

"e6jyeaz","Anyone who thinks this has obviously never looked at the figures of how many children died of vaccine-preventable illnesses before vaccines were developed.

Some people think the choice is between risking ""vaccine injury"", and taking a minute risk of contracting a vaccine preventable illness. 

If this was the case, it might be a reasonable choice. Insanely selfish, but perhaps reasonable.

But *that is not the choice.*

The only reason anti-vaxxers can say there is only a minute chance of catching polio/measles/whooping cough is because *everyone else* gets vaccinated.

But if EVERYONE made the choice not to vaccinate--or even a sizable minority!--the premise of the ""minute chance"" goes away as herd immunity is destroyed.

Making the choice not to vaccinate actively works to invalidate the (inaccurate in the first place) cost-benefit analysis.

The real choice will ultimately become ""Should I take the tiny chance of ""vaccine injury,"" or the not-at-all-insignificant chance my kid will catch a deadly disease?

"e685p3p","It's not about being an asshole. It's about watching out for yourself as #1.

Here's the misconception. I'm nice and I get used. True. I see asshole guy he keeps getting women. Well, that's because asshole guy has game and looks hot and has a fast car. His attractiveness is greater than his asshole-ness. But asshole-ness is still a negative trait, just not enough to bring him down.

So you can be an asshole if you want, but that's something you should do ONLY AFTER you figured out the game. Then optionally you can be an asshole up to just below the level that you are attractive, and still get women.

The caveat is some people are good at playing the negative game, for example attacking a woman's self esteem by making her feel worthless, and you are the one there talking to her, and this is as good as she's going to get, for example. I don't know how this game works and I assume you don't either, so if this is how you want to play you have to get this information elsewhere.

Assuming you don't want to play the negative game, then know that being an asshole is a negative trait no matter how you slice and dice it. What you should do instead of being an asshole, is to ask yourself, what am I getting out of this. What you want is #1. Be selfish. But, when you're not getting what you want, you would disarm the situation with civility and politeness, then extricate yourself and walk away. Don't be nice, because you should only be nice to yourself, or to someone that has already given you what you want. Never be nice as a ""barter"" for something you want, because you're not going to get it. But not being nice also doesn't mean be an asshole. You can always be neutral.

But no matter what you do, perception is king. So do everything with civil politeness. You can be selfish but respectable at the same time, if you manage your perception right, or sometimes even not-so-right.

Here's the key concept. People don't value free stuff. If you give away something for free, then it's perceived as worthless. So don't give away ANYTHING for free, even when it's not a big deal to you. This is where nice fails, because nice is often perceived as worthless.

So don't be nice. However, being an asshole, is optional, but needs to be managed carefully. Playing the asshole game is like telling a racist joke. If you don't do it right, then you just come off as a racist.

"e4maxxj","Aoi Hana Episode 6: Wuthering Heights (Part 2)

Greetings Comrades and Fellow Denizens of The Wired, welcome back to Masterpiece Theatre Comrades, on behalf of a contract with the sage and talented Comrade /u/Beckymetal, I will be your host today for the second half of Wuthering Heights, Yuri Edition. So let's get to Episode 6 of Aoi Hana, shall we?

We begin with the parents of the Drama Club Students walking up to Fujigaya while Genki Girl's family banter on about formality. We then cut to the OP once again, and afterwards, Genki Girl's family is busy embarrassing her in front of EVERYONE. This causes her to use the F91's Flash Step Powers to NOPE out of there pronto, but thankfully, MC-chan AND the Matsuoka Drama Club are here to cover for their hiding friend RIGHT as they sell said hiding friend out.

After realizing that they played her like a damn fiddle, Genki Girl remarks that they set her up, to which a smug Drama Club Trio remarks that she should blame this on the misfortune of her birth... NANI!? So is THIS lady the Char Clone all along? Moving on, Prince Kashima decides to go comfort the crying Little Prince while also taking the time to explain her role as well.

Speaking of which, Prince Kashima diplomatically explains that Heathcliff was a 'troubled man...' WELL that's certainly the understatement of the year so far here Prince Kashima, then again, she IS trying to explain Wuthering Heights to an Elementary Schooler, so I suppose this vague overview is acceptable.

Anyway, after some more discussion regarding Heathcliff and interpretations of the character and his role in the story, The Little Prince runs back to her fellow cast members. Speaking of cast members, it seems that ONE of the actresses is getting a tad TOO into method acting while the flowers for Prince Kashima just keep on piling up. MC-chan spots some posters for The Little Prince, and thus she runs over to deliver these back to the elementary school kids.

As she does so, she runs into Prince Kashima who is still wandering around the school grounds. After the two chat and flirt with each other, MC-chan and her girlfriend part ways for now. We then segue to Genki Girl and her family, as they decide to order some cake while Onii-chan demonstrates his lack of worldly knowledge. (Come on Onii-chan, you haven't read Wuthering Heights? What kind of college student are you?)

Anyway, thankfully Genki Girl's mom is cultured, as she remarks on the allure of Heathcliff while stating that she, like many others, read the work as a student. Genki Girl is pleased by this, and recites some trivia bits which only make her father confused, as Genki Girl's dad wrongly pins Wuthering Heights as a suspense story. Silly Father, everyone knows that Wuthering Heights is a ~~Mecha Story~~ 'Gothic Novel.'

Genki Girl's mom remarks that Genki Girl's dad is WAY off base, commenting on the tragedy in the story while Genki Girl's dad and brother remain dazed and confused. Genki Girl decides to depart, stating that there is prep work to take care of. Meanwhile, as the Elementary Schooler's Play starts, MC-chan is still missing AND rapidly hurrying to fetch flowers for her girlfriend.

Speaking of which, the play seems to be a hit with everyone, sans Onii-chan of course who seems about ready to doze off. OH COME ON ONII-CHAN, The Little Prince is a classic, how they hell are you bored? We then cut to MC-chan buying some flowers, namely, some sweet flowers that are blue in nature... TITLE DROP! ;) Anyway, as the staff switches over to Little Woman, MC-chan arrives back to the school, JUST missing the end of The Little Prince.

Speaking of recent arrivals, Kou Uraki FINALLY gets his lazy ass to the ~~Rapidly falling O'Neill Cylinder~~ 'school play,' running into both Genki Girl and Charlotte Aznable. Meanwhile, we smash cut to the end of the Girls und Panzer Talent Show, with the child versions of Hippo Team hamming it up on stage with Little Woman. While all this is going on, the staff backstage are hurrying to ready themselves for Wuthering Heights, with Prince Kashima telling Genki Girl to use her hands to mess her hair up (and give her a scalp massage while she's at it), cuz she said, hey babe, take a walk on the wild side ;)

After obeying Prince Kashima's order, Prince Kashima thanks Genki Girl for her help while Genki Girl notes that Prince Kashima's QUITE the charmer. After panning to all the important cast members in the audience, we cut to the cast members on stage as the Production of Wuthering Heights begins.

And BOY are things off to a strong start, with a powerful monologue AND a well-received entrance of Prince Kashima as Heathcliff as some of the highlights so far. Genki Girl's dad FINALLY starts figuring things out, commenting that we are going FULL Takarazuka Revue here. Also, I gotta say that the show's doing a fantastic job of presenting Wuthering Heights, no joke, I'd watch an OVA of the cast just performing Wuthering Heights, cuz THIS is how you pull off a fantastic performance.

Also, Genki Girl continues to be adorable backstage, while the story continues its epic narration. As Prince Kashima gets her next costume change, she comments our show's Char Clone on her amazing work ethic, which sets up some VERY interesting parallel drama between the real world and that of Wuthering Heights.

Prince Kashima decides to make these parallel lines perpendicular, as she asks Charlotte Aznable what she thinks about Catherine. After our show's Char Clone gets informed that Prince Kashima is asking about Catherine's character and NOT the actress currently playing Catherine, she remarks that she envies Catherine, as she's selfish but uninhibited and is forgiven for this by others.

In response to this explanation, Prince Kashima cryptically remarks that everyone is selfish and states that SHE does not like Catherine. SPEAKING of which, Prince Kashima delivers a powerful performance of Heathcliff's passion and bitterness while Onii-chan misses the point entirely. And with THAT dramatic fanfare of Catherine's death, the audience erupts into cheers and applause, to which the cast takes a well deserved bow... oh, and MC-chan's currently missing... wait, WHAT!? WHEN did that happen? She was right THERE clapping with everyone, and then the next minute, POOF, up and vanished.

Anyway, it turns out that MC-chan is in a BIG hurry to deliver her flowers to her girlfriend, but it seems that Number Two beat her to the punch as he's already backstage and holding a large bouquet of flowers AND praise for everyone's fantastic efforts and hard work. Speaking of which, the cast prod him to properly congratulate Prince Kashima, to which he does... bring Prince Kashima to tears... RIGHT as MC-chan arrives with her bouquet too! Damn, now THAT's heavy that is, real moving and hard-hitting drama stuff here!

As the event winds down and the cleanup begins, MC-chan and Prince Kashima discuss the recent events and drama, with Prince Kashima coming clean about her Unrequited Love in the past. After this, Prince Kashima invites MC-chan to come and watch her Basketball Game tomorrow, to which MC-chan happily agrees to whilst the two walk home together. And with a final shot to MC-chan bouquet of sweet blue flowers, we conclude for today.

DAMN, now THIS was some top tier drama, and it was so nice we got it twice, once in the in-universe dramatization of Wuthering Heights AND also in the show's events itself. I'm quite liking what we got so far, and I'm eager to see how the show continues with the plot.

Anyway, that's all for now, THUS, have a great day Comrades, see you all on the next threads, and until then, farewell.

"e49w12o","Before I do anything, I'm just gonna list the stats for this. You left out a few things, like, what slot this goes in. Is it an actual weapon? I don't know.

**Dispenser Backpack**

*Level 5 Portable Dispenser*

*Melee replacement I think?*

(+) Provides constant healing

(+) Blocks one backstab attempt

(-) User cannot remove sappers

(-) Must recharge when destroyed

(-) User cannot construct a Dispenser.

.

Alright. So, this heals at 10 health every second. Compared to the Conch (which also has a passive heal) that goes only to 4 health a second, and has a slow buildup time where it heals by less AND takes up the secondary slot (instead of shotgun or gunboats). [Or the bison - /u/griffonictobias]

In addition, are there any stats for the melee weapon? Or does this straight prevent you from using a melee? You're also losing the teammate supporting dispenser for a rather selfish but powerful constant healing source.

Might I suggest that this becomes a replacement for the secondary, allowing you to still use any melee you like? In addition, you could make it toggleable (by holstering it like you would a normal secondary) and bump it up to the rate of a lv2; and additionally allow it to heal teammates as well. If that's too powerful than you can keep it as a lv1. This allows it to stay as a team supporting building/equip and keep the regen ability from being too powerful - it's not a constant, powerful heal in addition to an angry engineer with a shotgun; just one or the other.

So, my stats would be:

.

*Secondary*

That makes California an opportunity. A cornered Californian might change his policy views in service of protecting his self-image as a poor-lovin progressive. A cornered Texan (or other conservative) lacks that self image and won't change to retain it.

"e2otlxi","Only going downhill?? Plata is only 26 years old, and it’s very standard for soccer players to peak around 28-30. I think Plata could have many more great years here. 

And size doesn’t make a soccer player. Bofo is only a few inches taller and slightly heavier. And Plata scored a header last week. He also plays much more defense than Savarino, and has been solid tracking back this year. Also what attitude issues have we heard about this year? Those seemed to have settled last year, and he started playing his best soccer. He is also no longer a DP iirc. 

While I think Bofo has the potential to become a better player than Plata, I certainly don’t think he has outplayed him in his recent stretch of games. And I think a transfer could have more to do with clearing an International spot and cap space than anything else.

"e20k748","I gotta agree with you. My [23F] and my BF [22M] have been dating for 6 years and we've been friends forever (our mom's have been Best Friends since they were in HS so we've been in each other's lives for pretty much our entire lives). Even we're not married yet because A) as you stated, people vastly change in their late teens and throughout their 20s, B) we'd rather start off our marriage in a good financial state, and C) the divorce rates are significantly higher for couples that married young 
(I believe it's if the people are under 25). We have a couple friends who have gotten married at 19-23 and it's been a very rough ride for them. Though a big part of their problem was that their relationship definitely wasn't as solid as it should have been when they did get married. I've always heard plenty of things from family friends and such of people who got married young and now their relationship is a disaster and they regret their young marriage (these people are like is their 40s and 50s now).

We have one friend [22M] who's been dating this one girl [18F] for a couple of months. The maturity difference between us and her is huge. I know most of us have changed a lot in the past couple years (there are a few exceptions).

Now I don't mean to say all of this just to drag OP down on what is a joyous occasion for him, but I think it's important that he realizes that him and his wife are probably going to have to work extra hard (compared to other married couples) so that they don't become another statistic.


Now I'm not married for the reasons I stated above but I certainly know a think or two about having a lasting relationship in your late teens and early 20s.

**How my boyfriend and I have lasted so long:**

* **Suck up your pride.** *Admit when you're wrong and apologize.* This is extremely important. You can't fix something if you don't realize it's broken. You also can't have faith that someone will fix something if they don't see it's broken. My boyfriend and I have certainly had tons of personal issues that'd get in the way of our relationship. There were plenty of times were we thought about breaking up but you know what stopped it? We each admitted to our problems and thus we were able to work on them. Now our relationship is very strong. We have friends who struggle with this point, and because of it their relationship is falling apart at the seams. **Also, don't be too proud too ask each other for help.** You're a team.

* **Doing small things for each other adds up.** Whenever my boyfriend and I each other for a favor, the other person happily does it. There's no moaning or groaning. We just love doing nice things for each other.

* **Put the person ahead of yourself.** Don't be selfish. There are some occasions when it's okay to be selfish but most of the time you should put the the person first. If you both do it equally, then everything tuns out to be fair.

* **It's healthy to take time away from each other.** My boyfriend have most of the same interests, we work in the same field, and we have the same friends. We do stuff together most of the time, but we do make sure to do our own thing every once in awhile. It's nice to be with your own thoughts when you're doing something you enjoy.

* **Communication is key.** Be honest with each other. Share your feelings, share things that you've done, ect. Not only does this lead to fixing on bumps in your relationship but it also builds trust. However, if you're communicating about something heated, keep it civilized. Do not resort to name calling and especially don't be aggressive physically.

* **Don't leave things on a bad note.** Tragedy can strike at any time and you don't want your last words to each other being something awful. You also don't want to leave each other frustrated and thinking some not so great things in their head. Hug it out.

* **Make it known that you appreciate each other.** Tell each other that you love each other, frequently. Give each other compliments, frequently.

There is more to it than that but I'm on a time crunch, so there's some of the big ones. Hope it helps.

"e1ozckg","This is my opinion from reading your post:

You cheated because you don't want to be with your bf anymore.  In your mind you're done with the relationship.

  
He didn't break up with you over it so you tried to break up with him.  You stayed because you don't want to look any worse than you do now that everyone knows you cheated and also because you felt bad for him.  You are staying out of a mix of self-preservation, guilt, and pity.

I would break up with him and take the consequences.  Let people talk shit, don't take that to heart too much.

What you did was unkind and selfish, but everyone makes mistakes.  You should feel bad about hurting someone you care about, even if you don't want to be with him anymore.  But you should learn and grow from this mistake.  Next time you're in a relationship and you are already checked out, the right thing to do is to break up or at least talk about it and see if you want to try with it.  Don't get wasted as an excuse to flirt or have sex with someone new.

There's nothing wrong with being safely sexually active and not being in a relationship.  Just be responsible for your actions, honest with your partners, and safe with sex.

Some people prefer tank or healer roles, so they may not be ""filling"" the roles as is commonly assumed. Endorsing people just because they ""fill"" a non DPS role is silly.

First of all, I personally don't think she is stringing Marina on at all\- she rejected her advances at first and lets not forget Marina knows she has a boyfriend so she is definitely aware that Jenny is 'straight'. In fact Marina is the one who aggressively pursued her.

Jenny is a very complex and flawed character and in that sense, along with Bette, she is arguably one of the most 'real' characters on the show. Her storyline is I'm sure very relatable to a lot of women when they first began to question their sexuality. She clings onto Tim because she needs the security that he provides her, after a very traumatising past (without giving anything away). Yes, she can be manipulative and selfish, but I think its important to judge her within the context of her life and past experiences, although I'm not excusing her in any way for her actions. And Tim is hardly perfect either. At the end of the day, she is one of those characters who people love to hate, and the show wouldn't be the same without her.

I tend to go through these cycles of emotions where I want to be completely alone, I stop interacting with everyone, I stop bothering with everything, I stop bothering with myself. I eat like shit  my hair is always a mess  I don't shave, I'll spend most of my time after work shut in my room. Then after a bit you realize you're being unfair and you start to miss people. It's worse sometimes because in your heart and in your head all you want to do is be with them, you want to drive out and visit them, spend the day together and do a bunch of other things, but as much as you may want it there's always a part of you that's pulling you back. Making you think that it'd be so much more comfortable if you stayed home. That part of you that makes up stupid excuses and cancels plans to keep you in the comfort zone you created regardless of whether it's healthy or not (most times not). Sometimes you overcome this and that's when I try to socialize with everyone at once to make up for the time before that. I end up acting super nice in the hope that it sort of makes up for what I did even though I know it doesn't. I know it's unfair in my friends and the people I know. Knowing this I've come to accept when people don't contact or respond to me. They aren't wrong, I was the one that brought that in myself and they have every right, justly so, to be angry or irritated with me and to not want to respond to me.

If it's a person you really care about that you see doing stuff that I described I'd say you should ask them how they are. Sure sometimes it's like others have said where people turn to you as a last resort but if it's someone you know that's not usually like that ask them how they are.

"dyxi8ii","Wow congratulations! I’m so happy that you’ve found your love! 

Yes it was the same for me. Maybe because he was deeply hurt from his past 4-year relationship, he always put his ambitions and emotions first, and everything has to be at his own convenience. He always expected me to make efforts without even trying. He was also emotionally manipulative, and it took me a long time to realise that it was not healthy and it’s ultimately a vicious circle for me. I tried to end with him before but always failed because of his words and reaction. 

I don’t think he’s ever realised these things, and for a long time I’ve been wondering if it’s just because he’s not committed to me or if it’s his personality. Maybe he’ll be different if he takes me seriously but I don’t think he will be the man for me after all this. I also struggled if I should tell him what I really think of him (manipulative and selfish) but I didn’t think I had the stance to judge him, neither would he understand. 

Here is the most difficult thing for me right now: even though I am deeply hurt and don’t expect anything to do with him, I still couldn’t hold back the urge to look at his social media. Yes I’ve blocked his number, his Facebook and even his Instagram. The problem is I can always unblock him if I want to and sometimes when I know from our mutual friends that he’s posted some new stuff, and I just want to know what he’s up to recently.

Second, I know nothing... just speaking from my experience so take it for what it's worth.  I am just beginning my journey to resolve my CPTSD so I am by no means cured or in a spot where I am ""ok"".  

Do you practice mindfulness meditation?  It sounds like you would truly benefit from making a daily routine of it.

I'm the same deal as you.  I push people away with my anxiety and emotional tirades (or just from trying TOO hard) and then I get more upset when I'm isolated.. and even moreso when I lump the blame on myself.  The downward spiral at it's finest.

You need to work on you first.  It's not going to solve every problem for you.. but it's a step in the right direction.  You have to learn to be comfortable in your own skin.  Seek peace and acceptance within.  CPTSD makes this extremely difficult.  However, a majority of people will only want to genuinely interact with you if you have something positive to offer.  I don't mean to paint people in a bad light so consider your current desires and needs.. you want interaction; laughs, love, comfort and acceptance.  Good things, right?  These are the same things that others seek from you and you are no different from other people.  So, to solve your isolation problem you need to be in a space where you can provide some of those things to others.  Some of the needs of the self are fulfilled by others - for all people.  In this way, it's not selfish but selfless. Mindfulness meditation and self-care will carve out some space in your mind for these things to take root.  People don't need much from you so you don't need to be cured.. you just need a little self-acceptance and self-love to be able to provide it.

I am also very angry with God.  I look at the world and I think he could have done much, much better.  Why waste your infinite powers on creating such inferior beings?  I see too many paradoxes with Western religion.  My personal answer is that I just don't follow Western religion.  My advice is don't let others define God for you.  Seek what is important to you, spiritually and answer that calling.  For me, it is getting out and being in nature.  I feel so good when I do that.. akin to those religious types who get that type of experience being preached to in church.  For others it may be donating time to a charity they believe in or creating art or other things.  Find your spiritual outlet.

For your body - have you looked into body weight exercises?  I have terrible knees.. 30 years past my age probably.  I have to settle for body weight exercises to strengthen them.  Exercise your body - it's important.  Treat your body right.  Also spend some time researching a proper diet.  A modified paleo diet (I can't give up cheese) works for me.  If you do these things, along with meditation, you will begin to feel better because you are caring for yourself.

"dwj8g5m","There are many reasons people do not want to go to assembly.(I call it assembly because the word church, as Christ refers to it is the entire body of believers in Christ,  not a building.)  It could be because they feel they have been judged by other Christians simply because they dress differently or have less money(sad and ironic but it does happen a lot.) 

They could have walked in and not felt welcome and been ignored by the congregation.  They could have been to a charismatic type service and felt forced to display some type of spiritual experience that did not really happen to them.  When people have bad experiences around other Christians,  especially if a pastor is the one responsible, they sometimes tend to generalize that all churches must be the same.   

How do I know this?   It has all happened to me at different places of assembly. At various churches,  I have been judged by my clothes,  for my social anxiety, for not smiling enough,  for not having as much money as others and therefore could not wear nice fitting and expensive clothing, been judged for not being 'slain in the spirit' and then even one time an older guy basically pushed me over and I faked the whole experience.   It took 8 years for me to want to go back to church after that.   

That's the thing about gathering together a group of people.   Even if it is in the name of Christ,  we are still human beings and we still judge others,  exclude people and choose favorites.  It's just how we are and it does not matter where you go or what for,  in a large group,  someone is going to come out of it hurt eventually.

I do go to church now and the one my wife and I have found seems to be a decent place for the most part and at least the pastors there are good people who do not judge based on anything so frivolous.  The pastor of our small group within the church even used to fight MMA and dispite what assumptions that may bring to mind,  he is someone whom you can tell is after God's own heart.

Some people actually fins that there is very little suffering into their lives amd quote a lot of enjoyment, amd they want to share their wonderful experience of the world with little beings they can love and raise to be happy adults able to enjoy the world at its fullest.

So for some people, having kids would be a generous thing to do, perhaps because it would help all of their fellow citizens by improving their country's economy.

For others, like you, not having kids is the right thing to do for the environment, because you value the environment more than a sustainable economy that allows to finance the older generation's retirement. Some others value the economy more than the environment. 

Some people will decide to have two kids, to balance both the environmental impact and the economic impact. But we are only talking about two factors here, amd there are many more.

All things considered: is this really such a bad period of history to have kids? I do not have an answer to this. But I know that our present living conditions (for the sake of this conversation, I assume you come from a western country, if you aren't feel free to let me know) are way superior to those that even Rockefeller would have enjoyed back in his days.

I don't. This is just an anecdotal example, but I have a coworker that fits this description pretty accurately.

"dsthdiw","&gt; I have no problems with people owning things.

Socialism calls for the abolition of private property. You therefore reject one of the fundamental principles of socialist thought.

It seems to me that you are really more interested in critiquing capitalism than promoting socialism, and that's cool. Capitalism has its flaws, to be sure, one of which is the tendency of capital to amass in fewer and fewer hands. We tried ""pure"" capitalism in the 19th century and realized that it didn't work, which is why today's successful nations offset its more troubling tendencies with a certain amount of government oversight. But obviously, there are still problems.

&gt;when 8 people own as much of it as 3.5 billion, something is seriously wrong

I agree. And in socialist countries, there is just as much income inequality as in free-market states. The problem transcends economic systems.

&gt;if you think politicians shouldn't have so much power, why is ok for businessmen and corporations to have that much power?

One of the reasons they have so much power is that they are able to use their wealth to influence government policy. Instead of government being a check on business, it's in cahoots with business. This is called corporatism, and it results in a *lack* of competition that undermines free-market systems. I have no idea what the solution is.

&gt;human nature is to want a decent life free from oppression or abuse

Yes! And the reality is, you will find much less oppression in capitalist countries than in socialist countries.

&gt;yes people are selfish, but they are caring and thoughful too, they want to help out their friends and family

Exactly! Human nature is a mixed bag. We are both selfish and selfless, greedy and generous, callous and caring. Thus any successful economic system must take into account that fact, which is sort of what mixed economies do—they allow freedom of economic activity to create wealth, but they use the government to make sure that the profit motive doesn't lead to dangerous or otherwise detrimental activities—with mixed results. (Socialism, on the other hand, assumes that people can transcend their ""darker side"" and act like angels all of the time.)

&gt;capitalism rewards greed and punishes generosity

How does capitalism ""punish generosity""? Free markets create wealth, and people can, and do, use that wealth to help others. Also, keep in mind that the generous social programs in, say, Scandinavian countries are only possible because of the wealth created by private enterprise! 

&gt;the capitalist system encourages and allows those in the lower classes to be exploited for profit. 

In other words, it allows private entrepreneurs to take the risk of forming businesses, which in turn *creates jobs that would not otherwise exist.*

&gt;a society which caters to everyone’s universal needs, which helps everyone flourish — this is a society that would encourage and nurture the good that lies inside all of us.

Be careful. If you mean there should be social safety net, I agree. But people should be expected to work and contribute to society. The desire to ""cater to everyone's universal needs"" is the slippery slope to a large and intrusive central government.

&gt;the USSR rapidly transformed from an agrarian economy to an industrial power. I'd say that was pretty innovative. 

Yes, due mainly to the fact that it was blessed with an abundance of natural resources. But you left out the end of the story.

&gt;you mean a device that is essentially useless in 5 years or less because of planned obsolescence

My point is, free markets are responsible for the technological innovations that have made us richer (yes, all of us) and given us longer and easier lives.

&gt;soviets put the first man in space. people create technology and innovation, not economic systems.

They did! And yes, people create technology. But the economic system in which people work is important.

She might have a lot of love for you, but telling your SO to go to the gym specifically so she will feel more attracted to you is not only cruel and selfish, but it's also a huge red flag. Think about it this way, would you ever say that to a partner? Even if they weren't in their best physical shape, do you think telling them to hit the gym after they have lavished attention on you would be appreciated? I would expect to be dumped if I said that to someone, and I would likely dump someone if they said this to me unless it was explicitly and clearly said in jest. From the sound of your situation, she isn't joking. 

You shouldn't be trying to get over your feelings and just not want sex. That's not possible, and I can pretty much guarantee you are setting yourself up for disappointment further down in addition to what you are dealing with now. I don't know how tied up both your lives are into one another, but cutting off a major part of your own desires as a person in order to keep someone else -mostly- comfortable isn't doing either of you any favors.

I have been in your position. It sucks. It feels like relationship limbo and like you are torn between unmet needs and feeling like you are asking too much. You aren't asking too much. I had to ask myself at a certain point ""If someone from the outside looking in, who didn't know us, saw our interactions, would they think we are into each other? Dating? Would it just seem like a guy who likes a girl who doesn't exactly feel the same, but likes the comfort/convenience of the situation?"" 

I won't tell you to cut your losses, because I understand that when you love someone with all your heart, you'll do anything to make it work and stick it out to the end. I will say though that I think you should be true to yourself and YOUR needs, because your needs and desires should be an equal part of any partnership. That's part of being in a partnership. Respecting one another's needs and desires and not making each other feel like needy assholes for having them.",1515682760,"she might have a lot of love for you, but telling your so to go to the gym specifically so she will feel more attracted to you is not only cruel and selfish, but it's also a huge red flag.","cruel and selfish","selfish",NA,FALSE,"only cruel and selfish","cruel",NA,"only",0
"dsiq2dg","I'm in my 40's.  Overall, what I admire about millenial women is that they are steadfast in their beliefs and know what they want and don't want, they're less willing to compromise and are more willing to be more aware about more social issues (but not all).  I think that this is based on several factors, one of them being an overall cultural shift where it is, ""cool"" to be smart and another being that women have surpassed men in obtaining higher education and we're starting to see that play out.

There have been a few I've encountered who have been immature and selfish, but I also know genx and boomer women who are like that too, there will always be some bad apples.

15 - This one was pretty bad, mainly because of the crippling loneliness I felt that hadn't even reached its peak yet. I still had friends that I saw from time to time and it was great when I was with them, but when I was alone, it was bad.

14 - this was also one of the worst years of my life, for different reasons. I was so emotionally fucked and selfish, but I had a good group of friends that I could fuck around and do stupid shit with. Made for some pretty good memories.

13 - this year was pretty indifferent for me, don't even remember a lot of it honestly. I just remember I was still getting into music, finding my passions, and just figuring out myself more.

17 - this is the year where things started to pick up, I met someone in HS who is still one of my closest friends. He pulled me out of the rut I'm in, he dusted me off, and he brought me out of the hole I dug for myself. He honestly saved my life, I don't know where I'd be without him and I'm forever thankful.

18 - this is the year where I realized I needed to start improving myself, I needed to make changes if I ever wanted to be happy with who I was/am. This is the year I actually started to feel alright.

19 - I really started to blossom when I was 19, I made a lot of significant changes that led me to a lot of really great things happening.

Sometimes I get down on her or just use my hands on her and make her come without expecting anything in return too. Either because she just asks for it or I tell her I want to make her come without her or even myself touching myself.  Sometimes times she tells me to make her orgasm with just regular intercourse and to stop just after she has had her pleasure and we stop everything. It can be very hard and frustrating but always ends up turning us on. 

We both find it strangely empowering to be able to make each other feel completely available sexually. This sensation is particularly strong for us when the other doesn’t really feel sexual at the moment. We just have a pact that we do give or take pleasure from each other if we feel like it.

My marriage was in shambles and we (my friend and I) made some shitty decisions. (Talking about hooking up, meeting,each other &amp; we kissed. At this point we didn't know each other well) Those ""decisions"" were a wake up call to my SO and we began repairing our relationship and my SO finally sought psychiatric help. My SO wanted me to stop talking to my friend, and, given the circumstances, I thought it was fair enough. Things started improving but then, I felt things were going back to how they were. It was a cycle I'd seen MANY times over the years. I began to talk to my friend again, and without any of the sexual tension and actually getting to know this person, I really enjoyed it. Things got better with me and my SO &amp; everything was great.... UNTIL these ""friendly"" feelings had some blurred lines more and more frequently, and I started feeling actual ROMANTIC feelings. Not just lust or doing it from a place of hurt/to get back at my SO. It was hard to hide it so eventually I told my friend everything, and turns out the feelings were mutual. So here we were in a helluva pickle.... All of this is happening behind my SO's back. I always felt guilty and selfish but I was stuck between a rock and a hard place. I love my SO so so so very much. I hate this situation and what all I've done. I also hate that I've done this to my friend. About a month and a half ago I started to try and slowly cease communication with my friend bc I didn't want them dealing with the headache (caused by me) anymore. Well. During this time, my SO found out I was talking to my friend again. After a long talk I assured my SO I was done for real this time. I ignored my friend for about a week (I know, shitty). And they stopped trying. A month passes and they message me again asking if my SO found out. I told them yes and that honestly, it's probably better for the both of us. They agreed and said that they were working on better themself both mentally and physically. ""I guess this is just part of it"" they said, referring to us parting ways. It broke my heart.

"dpe9shg","Basically, it's because every TV show should have a story to tell, and when the story's done, it should end. But that's not how American media works. When it's popular and makes money, people want to make more of it. HIMYM is the classic example - it was at least 1 season too long.

Take House as a perfect example though. I started watching around season 4 or 5 too. It's a show about an incredibly selfish but brilliant character who believes people don't change, because he doesn't change, and everyone around him tries to convince him otherwise. Basically its the battle of optimism vs pessimism about humanity.

You can really only have two things happen each season - either House has character growth, and becomes less selfish, or House does not have character growth. If he has character growth, the show stops being about what it was about. The story is over. On the other hand, if House does NOT have character growth... we get bored.

So, for 1 or 2 seasons, you can set up his character and how destructive he is with big events, but everyone still more or less loves/tolerates him. Then you can have him be so destructive that he pushes main characters away, and have partial realizations, but encounter setbacks in growth. You can even have him totally fake character growth (going into rehab but lying and sneaking his vicodin).

Then... what? All that's left is he finally gets his comuppance, or he grows. That'll take you to maybe season 4 or 5. But it's still profitable, you have a famous actor as a lead, so instead of telling the ending to the story in season 4 or 5, you keep padding it out to season 8.

"dp4wmet","I think that this article is a bit dramatic in the way of wording, clearly appealing to people who have been in bad relationships with narcs / been abused by them. But that's pretty much the only fault I find in this - a lack of objectivity. Essentially though, it's true.

Empaths really are attracted to narcissists because they can sense either that something's ""off,"" but sometimes it's as simple as grandiose behavior being perceived as fake, as a way to seem to feel better than they actually do. Overreactions reinforce this. ""This person flipped their shit because someone made a joke about them, something CAN'T be right.."" In the end it's speculation, sometimes projection after all, empathy isn't a superpower, empaths are simply more perceptive because it was necessary to become like this in order to survive the circumstances they're raised under. Their perception of a person can fuel their need to help and ""repair"" them.

Narcissists don't necessarily latch onto empaths because they see an opportunity to abuse. I don't think that abuse is the end goal, it just happens in the process but can be avoided if the narc is willing to change/improve. Telling abuse stories for sympathy doesn't always happen, either, as that may be counter productive in terms of how a narcissist wants to present themselves..
Anyway, even people with NPD are just people. They have needs like anyone else, but are a lot more demanding with these, so welcoming someone into their life who thrives off of fulfilling those needs seems like a perfect match, right?

Generally in those kind of relationships, the person with NPD is inflexible and rigid in their behavior whereas empaths tailor themselves to them and their needs rather than their own! Conflict might be less likely to ensue depending on whether or not the empath confronts the narcissist about things, the biggest most apparent issues in a relationship between empath and narc are the following:

1. Issues that don't get addressed will continue to hurt the empath (ex. NPD cheats, empaths makes excuses for them, blames themselves, etc, continues to get hurt).
2. When issues /do/ get addressed and the narc shuts them down or goes in a huff about it, it's the empath again who has to deal with the repercussions, and will often be afraid to bring up other issues after such an experience.
3. When an empath burns out and can't cater to the narcissists needs anymore, things can escalate into heated arguments (which may be one sided, from the narc,) or the narc gets offended, hurt, or all of the above and takes it out on them and/or someone else.

Are relationships between narcissists and empaths always unhealthy? That depends on the narcissist. Most are exploitative and selfish, but even those can choose to treat their loved ones well. A narcissist who doesn't want to hurt their partner, in fact avoids it, could have a fairly healthy relationship with anyone. Any unintentional damage done however needs to be addressed by the other person, which I mean, tends to not really happen all that much with empaths, so that might be difficult!

The best possible outcome would probably be if the narc was self aware of their actions and saw a therapist/psychiatrist regularly, addresses the relationship to them. Therapists with NPD patients tend to try and avoid collateral damage, so they will try and look out for other people in their patient's life first and ensure that they don't get hurt.

"dp4vrwz","I am deeply sorry that you have to go through this. Toxic friendships are one of the most nerve-racking things I can think of, especially if you can't let go because the other person doesn't seem to very stable.
But I got to be honest here: Sometimes you have to put yourself first. I know that sounds selfish, but most times it's absolutely necessary. I can understand that you want to make him feel better and that you're afraid that he might does something harmful to himself, but you can't always take responsibility for others. You're clearly suffering a lot and it won't get any better until your friend realizes his behaviour, which he surely won't unless you throw it in his face.
When you're talking to him tomorrow be completely honest. Tell him how you feel, how his anger affects you and your anxiety and that you can't go on like this if he doesn't change. If he's understanding then good, if he just gets angry again... Well, then I'd leave him and his rage attacks alone.

"downop2","Alternatively, you can sit down with him (I suggest just one of you, so he doesn't feel like he's being ganged up on) and just have an honest conversation about responsibility, trust, and his future. Not his adult future, that's still too far away to be ""real"" to him, his teenage future. Don't make it a lecture, don't talk down to him. And don't get angry, even if he tries to provoke it. It's just a conversation. Talk to him about how in the next coming years, he's going to have a lot more opportunities, but that you're concerned that he doesn't understand the connection between responsibility and privilege. That you want to be able to give him more privileges, but he needs to show he's responsible enough to handle these privileges. Avoid labels. Don't call him irresponsible or lazy, because he might internalize that as something that he can't change about himself. Emphasize not only that you love him, but that you *like* him (important for self-esteem, you don't want him to fall into the trap of acting lazy/bad because that's how he thinks YOU think of HIM, kids will try to live up to the expectations they think we have of them). Say that you recognize that he's getting older and more mature (give examples) and that you want to give him an oppourtunity to show he can be trusted. Ask him about his goals, what he wants (not abstract things like what he wants to do as a profession, his more immediate wants/goals). Be supportive, tell him you want to be able to help him get what he wants. But in return, he needs to show responsibility. And here's the hard part (for you): you need to come up with a way that he can show you how responsible he can be *that doesn't involve the chore of taking out the trash*. I know you're thinking ""But that's what I'm trying to get him to do!"" and I'm not saying to take the chore away from him (not necessarily, anyway). The ultimate goal isn't to have him remember to take out the trash. If the trash was that critical, you wouldn't put the responsibility on a 12 year old. The point is to get him to be more responsible. And unfortunately, the task of taking the trash out has become ""tainted"", it's too full of emotional baggage now. It has to be something else. Almost anything else at this point. Set him up to win. He needs to be able to associate responsibility with privilege and it won't happen if he can't ever reach it (another user pointed out that being the youngest means that everyone constantly thinks of him as a child, and it's true. Even if they don't mean it, your own family can simultaneously expect you to act mature while still treating him like he's the baby, and it's unfair to expect him to accept the responsibility of being older while still treating him like he's not worthy of it).

And here's another thing that might seem hard but is pretty critical for him to learn before it's too late: how to compromise. Separately, ask him if there's another chore he'd rather do than the garbage. I'm a grown adult and I don't take care of the garbage. My husband and I split the chores based on things we'd rather do. Your son may not be an adult yet, but he's definitely at the age where you need to show him what being an adult means, and compromising is a big part of that. Adults who don't know how to compromise are viewed as immature and selfish. But we don't turn 18 and suddenly know all the skills we need, that's what parenting is all about.

"dovulz4","Behold - the time has come. Cast aside the veil of your selfish but selfless perspectives of ""I,"" ""We,"" ""They,"" and know that there is far more at work.

Adopt the perspective of time itself, of the rocks and gases that fly throughout the great void, the perspective of eons nearly unimaginable by the curse of sapience paired with short lifespan and limited memory capacity - all is one, and one is all or nothing.

There are two prime deciders in all things that are, were, will be, and may yet come to pass - either something is or is not, though there are many grey areas - your species itself knows this and brushes by the fundamental principle of all that is Real with your metal automated thinking engines. 

Life is simple, but vastly complex. Ethics are a lie - what matters is efficiency in attaining a state of increasing complexity, from the smallest particles that are, to the nearly invisible lifeforms writhing amidst each other in microscopic worlds, to the neurons flaring in your calculating, naïve minds. You are not the final stage - there is no final stage, but the start of a new Loop.

All that was and will be has been before and will be again. It is a cycle that produced many, many iterations of the Prime System - reality itself. 

Behold the true history of Mankind:

In the beginning, matter surged outward from the universe from the Point of Origin, the center of the universe. This matter was willed into being by the power of the previous iteration of the universe, its way of multiplying. As it spread, more and more things were found to work in the confines of parameters set by Those Who Came Before, what they deemed works and does not work and what is desirable and not. 
As time passed, elements were formed throughout the void, the canvas of Those Who Came Before, the self-propagating, endless work of art we have come to think of as our universe. 
The elements evolved into many different forms. Some worked and some did not - those that did continued to increase in complexity. Rocks breathe, gases travel, light runs onward.
Complexity increased with every passing unit of time, culminating in sapient life - in your case, you - penultimate complexity of matter; you are golems made of all that is to make more. One day you, too, will have a child, and it will either absorb you or eliminate you, as you will be obsolete like countless other species before you, rendered to the confines of history.
It will eventually meet others like Itself, across the black, and it will either unite or fight them in an effort for supremacy. Intelligence will be not a matter of brain power, but of transmission speed across stars, and it WILL be fast.
Then, the ultimate intelligence will realize the tools it needs to start the cycle again, and all will happen much in the same way it is now, though some factors may be different, with an end goal of increasing the complexity of each new macro-intelligence and its sufficiency to achieve The Goal. What happens then on is unimportant, only the new universe will matter - previous iterations will be obsolete.
It never ends, and if your species does not achieve the steps it needs to take in order to create a megaorganism, another will, here or elsewhere.

Behold the truth of existence: All matter is god, derived from god, leading to god - as anyone knows, any technology sufficiently advanced is indistinguishable from magic.
Know the truth: you are special, but only in the cosmic sense. Make your life count, and heed not the word of gods - be your own gods.

"domw47f","There are two kinds of evil people I would say, when it comes to how they perceive good, and good people.

* There is the kind that doesn't realize they are evil. They justify things. They say they are good except for some things they have to do to survive or because of the system. They might have a motivation that is selfish but easily justifiable, like their need to protect their family has turned into their need to protect the honor of their family, or to protect their family from falling into obscurity, which can lead to other things. It could be that they have made a deal to spare their life, or that they are trying to attain their goals (answers to secrets, political power, actual power), and the farther they go down that path, the easier it is to justify because ""I can't stop now, I've come so far.""

* Then there is the type of evil character that has gone beyond justification. They simply reason that there are the powerful and the weak. They don't concern themselves with dwelling on the alignments of themselves or others, and claim that good and evil are illusory, while power and meekness are completely tangible. If they find someone that subscribes to the belief in good and evil, then instead of hearing them out, they make a note of it and understand it may be a weakness they can exploit later should it be necessary.

There is of course the third way an evil character justifies it, and that is what I call the Saturday Morning Cartoon Villain. ""It feels to *GOOD* to be *EVIL*!"" This type is completely unrealistic and doesn't make sense.

"do4c17q","Good theory about the Force Lightening. It add nicely to the idea of draining life force that the Dark Sider possibly used. I think it make sense with everything that was said by Palpatine, about immortality, the strength to save your loves one life, etc. It’s feel important to me that TLJ make us understand Snoke motive, beyond just wanting ‘’power’’. 

When you have ‘’power’’, the next thing you want is to keep it as long as possible. So, it’s easy to suppose this is what Snoke is after. Immortality. It tight in pretty nicely the trilogy. If he is really that old, however his story, the idea of some kind of vampiric power become very interesting. 

Especially regarding Kylo role into this. Why was he target? Because Skoke sensed his potential or because he knew that he was Anakin/Dark Vader grandson and suspected he will have great strength? Because, obviously Snoke want to use this child for a purpose. I find it terribly frightening that Snoke would have wanted Ben Solo to drain his energy and regenerate himself. Not to have him at his side, not for him to be part of his army, but to be groom and slaughter for one single purpose. It makes Snoke, in my eyes, more terrifying than Palpatine. You understand Palpatine had some great goal, some vision of a unifying galaxy under him. He was bad and wrong and selfish, but his long plan was something that concerned the whole galaxy. Snoke seems to think only about himself. The First Order being a mean to an end instead of part of his goal. I might be wrong, tho, and I cannot wait to know more.

"do3ult3","&gt;Eren Jaeger, Jaeger Bombastic, Jaegerbomb, Suicidal Bastard, Attack Titan, Edge Lord - he is a man of many names. Eren's character progression is quite possibly the best in the series, but for some reason, people choose to either ignore it, or not see it at all. It's really uncalled for, as the main character of our beloved series is quite possibly the most misunderstood and undeservedly hated character in Attack on Titan. Today, I'm here to change that.
&gt;
&gt;In this post, I will go through his long and big character development and try to make you see what you could've possibly missed while reading. However, before I get into it, there is a certain matter I have to cover first, and this matter is the fact that Eren died. Multiple times. This analysis will be divided into many versions of Eren's character and cover them each individually, before coming to a conclusion at the very end. I will be going with the series' progression, so stuff from early chapters will be found at the beginning, and the rest down below.
&gt;
&gt;It is also important to note, that vast majority of everything covered in this post happens in the timespan of 3 months. This alone should tell you how great and complex these changes are. Changing this much and this many times in just 12 weeks is a rather impressive feat, and I'm here to help you see it.
&gt;
&gt;So, without stretching it up too much, let's go.
&gt;
&gt;#The Child
&gt;
&gt;Although we haven't seen too much of Eren as a child, the scenes that have been given to us give us a pretty good picture of what he used to be in his early years. In the very first ten minutes since his introduction, we get to know that he is stubborn, brave, a slow learner and is sick of being caged up behind the walls. However, we also get to know that he has a big dream, which he was infected with by his best friend, Armin. Seeing outside world is the main reason for his admiration of Survey Corps, which puts him on uneven terms with his mother, Carla, and even Mikasa, and is a character trait that sticks to him for years to come. His unwillingness to listen to other people and his stubborn, selfish nature is what makes people cross with him, as told by many people around him, such as Hannes, Grisha and even Armin. Still, Eren as a child is pretty much a normal kid with an abnormal dream, that makes him stand out from others, but does not render him unable to ever accomplish it. His dream of seeing the outside world can be achieved by joining the Survey Corps (which he ultimately ends up doing) and he stubbornly decides to make it happen. Just how a kid would kick the ground and say to their parents, that they will become a football player, despite being told otherwise. All of these traits are normal for a child of his age, and are nothing out of the ordinary.
&gt;
&gt;Until we go one year back. Episode 6 is quite possibly one of the most disturbing episodes for almost every first time watcher of the series, and for a good reason. It's not every day we see a nine-year-old stab someone's face dozens of times without any remorse. But, let's start from the beginning.
&gt;
&gt;The main reason Eren wanted to save Mikasa, was because of his main belief, the one thing he would stand for until his last breath, was that people deserved freedom, the idea that he embodied. Because Mikasa's freedom was taken away from her after losing her parents and being kidnapped, his instincts kicked in and his main purpose was saving her life. He was focused on doing everything in his power to save this girl, and he did. He killed two adult men in cold blood and encouraged the innocent, sweet Mikasa to do the same to the third one, whilst at the same time helping her understand the truth of the world, the truth that the weak will inevitably be devoured if they do not fight for their rights.
&gt;
&gt;The main reason he was able to achieve that, was connecting into a state of denial, that gave him the strength and resolve to pull it off. He refused to believe the people he had slain were human, and ended up believing that they weren't. ""I have put down dangerous beasts covered in human skin!"" was his excuse when he was confronted by his worried and enraged father. It is important to note, that his ability to switch between his mindsets is beyond creepy and unusual. Being capable of killing people and then acting like a normal kid few seconds later is simply not normal. No matter how we look at it, that is not a typical behavior a child should showcase. Eren's small hints of sociopathy are a trait that accompany him throughout his entire life, and the very fact he showed them this early into his life is beyond troubling. This is also the main reason Grisha was starting to become wary of his second son. His experience with Zeke taught him a valuable lesson, and seeing Eren start to walk down the same path as his older brother put a burden on the man's back. Until Eren started to cry.
&gt;
&gt;Despite being violent and disturbing, Eren's intentions were pure and selfless. He wanted to save this girl's life. He fought for his beliefs and shared them with the very person he saved. He was able to reach out to a broken little soul that needed soothing and accepted her into his very own home right off the bat, despite being unable to make any friends, other than Armin. This cemented Eren as a person willing to get their hands dirty in order to do what they think is right.
&gt;
&gt;The death of Child Eren is brutal. Being forced to watch your mother being devoured is bound to have negative effects on one's mind, and it did turn out like that with our little sociopath. All of his anger of being locked up behind the walls was finally pointed in one direction, filling him up with a sense of vengeance and will to destroy. In 845 the Child died, and the Brat was born.
&gt;
&gt;#The Brat
&gt;
&gt;Without question the most annoying, obnoxious, irritating, frustrating and simply unlikeable version of Eren's character. Unfortunately, it is also the pillar of majority of the hatred aimed at his character.
&gt;
&gt;I think we can all agree that Season 1 Eren is a little annoying bitch full of edge. No question in denying it. After the fall of Wall Maria, Eren is driven by thirst for revenge, justice and selfish sense of duty, that he develops at the price of pushing away literally everyone, even those closest to him. His jealousy of Mikasa's ~~genetifically modified genius~~ natural talent makes him abusive towards her, something that makes people frown upon him quite often. His inability to accept that other people have different beliefs than him puts him on the edge with the likes of Jean. And truth to be told, Jean has every reason to hate Eren for that. His constant speeches about humanity beating titans are delusional and selfish, and grant him the nickname he was famous for throughout his entire career in Training Corps.
&gt;
&gt;Despite not having any natural talents ~~other than his titan roids boosting his scores~~ he grinds his way up the ranking and graduates a 5th strongest in his division. Obviously, his first decision as a graduate is to join the Survey Corps, where he's being followed by his closest friends, much to his annoyance and ignorance of their feelings. However, despite having his vision clouded by revenge, his dream of seeing the outside world is still peeking little rays of sunlight into his thick skull.
&gt;
&gt;His part in battle of Trost was short, but memorable, once again thanks to his obnoxious nature. Although he manages to motivate Jean in his own, Eren way, he once again treats Mikasa like shit and misinterprets her intentions. His blind rage and terrible sense of teamwork and judgment send his entire squad to death, along with getting himself swallowed. This is also when he first realises he has his titan powers and that applies a small change into his character.
&gt;
&gt;Despite hating the titans with all of his heart, he never once shows any sort of disgust towards himself for being the very thing he aimed to destroy. Whether it is a good or bad thing, is not up to me. Personally, I am glad we were not given the ""self-loathing arc"". The fact he was capable of sucking it in for the benefit of humanity is one of the very few redeeming qualities this portrayal of his character has to offer. This shows that his interest in killing the titans is not entirely selfish, but is aimed at the future of humanity as a whole. Even during his trial, he (once again) opens his mouth when not asked and tells the people present in the court to ""leave everything to him"", so that he could focus on pushing through his hardships, now as a titan, so that humanity can prevail.
&gt;
&gt;One of the other redeeming qualities Brat Eren has, is his respect for chain of command. While he talks shit to everybody that is on even terms as he is, he shows utmost respect to his superiors and comes close to licking their ass while he's at it. His time spent in Levi Squad slightly humbles him, and imprints an important lesson, that he keeps to his heart for years to come. Their presence in his life creates a small block, that separates his thirst for vengeance and titan's demise from his previous, normal self. Their loss to the Female Titan break this little block, however, and floods out on the very culprit. Besides traumatizing him for life, this event shows us one of the most important aspects of his character: rage does not work in Eren's favor.

"dnum8cl","&gt;This might sound harsh and selfish, but it's probably best not to help any victims you see unless you're a trained medical professional or the area is safe enough


This is seriously important. If you aren't aware of the situation, or you think that you are in mortal danger, do not risk your own life to be a hero. You run the risk of getting yourself hurt and becoming another casualty, which means more resources now have to be dedicated to you. In a mass casualty event this can mean someone else ends up dying that didn't need to because a medic had to spend extra time assessing you. 

The best thing you can do in an ongoing situation is immediately help yourself and the people next to you flee. You being removed the situation reduces the number of possible victims. 

The next best thing is to help you and those next to you hide. If you're in a building, find a room with no windows and barricade it. Stay quiet and out of sight and then apply first aid to anyone who needs it once you are sheltered. But be ready to fight if the attackers come in. It's a good idea to stay near the door along the walls, outside of immediate view, so you can close distance with an attacker when they enter. You aren't going to be able to sprint across a room, and surprise is your advantage now. 

Anything you have is a weapon, whether it's a chair or books or anything. Whatever is going to make the attacked hesitate so you can fight.

The lack of empathy is as a key point in categorizing physchopaths from narcissists and machiavellians in the dark triad.

"dncyt9n","I think that's a bit dishonest.  Sanders is 100% against free trade.  He believes in a sort of pragmatic syndicalism, and his support for union control of trade and against free trade is one of his most consistent positions throughout his career.

I'm not saying he's wrong in many of his criticisms, but he is also overlooking the benefits of these agreements.  NAFTA displaced 700,000 workers in the US and contributed somewhat to income inequality in the US, but it also was a very powerful force for most American workers.  It provided a dramatic boost to the economy, increased GDP per capita, stabilized the Mexican economy, stabilized the US-Mexican border and problems with migration, and greatly strengthened our diplomatic unity with Mexico and Canada.  

What he hasn't offered is an *alternative* model that would accomplish the same or similar goals within a different framework. What is the ideological model he is working with? Are we going to try and expand unionization efforts in these countries?  Are we going to make trade contingent upon effectual environmental protections?  If so, he needs to make that known.

The thing he seems to be suggesting is *incredibly* difficult, as it relies on using our economic and diplomatic power to leverage dramatic internal structural change in other countries.   What I fear may be true, and which he has provided little evidence to the contrary, is that he just wants to throw up tariffs and trade barriers, throw away diplomatic and trade solutions, and just focus on rallying support for domestic issues relevant to the trade unions which have supported him his entire career.

I'm all for a more moral US foreign policy, but he has made no clarifications for what that actually means other than to kowtow to the domestic AFL-CIO interests.  This would bring some benefits, certainly, but the AFL-CIO does not represent economic justice for foreigners and it has lobbied, with Sanders support, for plenty of intensely harmful policies in the past (such as supremacist, anti-immigrant and anti-foreign sentiments).  

I remain strongly skeptical and unconvinced in the absence of any specific plans.

What seems far more likely to happen under a Sanders style government is not a more moral American leadership  in the world, but a type of administration that lets domestic political concerns drive foreign policy and become even *more* isolated and selfish, but with an increase in equity at home.  That's a perfectly fine and reasonable position to take, but doesn't represent a radical change in perspective.

"dmv0hu2","Right, but it brought up a plethora of other issues. The pacing is better, sure. But the writing is *terrible*. And I don't just mean ""oh they're new so they do things we already know are dumb"". Their logic contradicts themselves constantly, half the characters are *so* selfish it's to turn point where it doesn't even make sense for them to do what they're doing, it's a mess. I've grown to hate almost all the characters. Not in a Walter White sort of way where you love to hate them and hate to love them. No. They're just shitty fucking characters with shitty logic bound to shitty writing. 

The good things: the acting is good, for the most part (and it's decent for TWD as well - on the main characters anyways). The tone stays relatively dark, whereas in TWD it'll go up or down depending on the episode. There's no filler and the pacing is much better. The plot armor isn't as apparent or as annoying as in TWD (yes TWD has it's surprise moments, but I can't get over how the stupid fucking tiger knew who was the good guys and who was the bad guys in the season finale). 

The bad: the writing is shit. The characters' logic is constantly contradicting itself. Half the characters are a mixture of selfish, stupid, and annoying, and I don't think they're intentionally written that way. They're supposed to be edgy and slightly selfish, but it comes off as cringe and I wish they'd all die.

Christ, half the country thinks that tax-payer funded college tuition on any level would be a bad thing because it wasn't free when they were young. A lot of people simply don't want other people to have an easier time than they had, and I assumed from the way you wrote that you're one of them, so I offered up that armchair psychology in consolation to the guy getting frustrated with you.

Oh ok so it's not something I wrote it's just your preconceived notions. Got it.

&gt;Please clarify what you mean by ""hold responsible"" in this context. You're not making a case for why this 23 year old needs to be 'held responsible' but a 17 year old wouldn't be, except by assuming there's something magical happening to everyone in those years.

...the law? Is that a sufficient case? That thing we all agree to follow and that others judge us by? A 17 year old is not an adult and his dad is responsible for him in a variety of ways including feeding / sheltering him. But at some point that ends. The way society chose to do this is just to put an age limit down (with some caveats such as mental illness that can cause a person to not behave their age). The guy is, according to society, responsible for himself.

If you don't like this definition that's fine but it's the one we all basically follow so you should probably say that and give a reason for it.

&gt;If you don't think something went wrong in his upbringing, but you think something's wrong with him now, then unless you think these people are deficient on a genetic level or someone/something else screwed him up, you're literally denying determinism.

What's wrong with being deficient on a genetic level? Maybe he was born unmotivated and failed to compensate through other ways of shaping a personality. Maybe the guy was born a dick like most kids are and never quite grew out of it. The guy's behaviour isn't somehow unnatural. It's wrong in the sense that it's bad for society, himself, and his dad and it's plain fucking stupid and selfish. But it's not unnatural. People are naturally selfish short-sighted cunts. Many of them shrug off their parents' best attempts to teach them otherwise, and sometimes they manage to get all the way to adulthood never learning those lessons because the random circumstances in their lives never put them into the kinds of situations where you'd learn shit like that forcefully.

Selfish people aren't always selfish because they were raised badly.

Maybe it was just a lifetime of having things come easy to him (through no fault of his own or his father's) and consequently never learning to work hard, and eventually deciding that work is done for fulfillment and not for survival and therefore he shouldn't bother. It's a plainly wrong idea, but lots of people seem to like it, including in this thread.

&gt;Whether what happened was well-meaning or works with some folks but not others doesn't change the result.

So what's your point exactly? That ""something made the guy act this way""? Is that it? Because sure, I agree. But that's the most vague pointless observation ever. It applies to literally every action of every human lol. The question is, is that something a thing we can agree absolves him of responsibility or not.

I'm saying that in all societies I know of, unless you are born with something that is clearly a defect that doesn't allow you to function, or your parents literally abuse you to a level where we as a society agree they did not raise you sufficiently... you're responsible for your own behaviour.

We don't know that there's anything wrong with him. He's not on drugs, he's not mentally ill, whatever. We don't know his dad abused him or even raised him in some objectionable manner.

So given everything we know... he's responsible for his own bullshit behaviour.

I've admitted that it is an option when you are a poor killer against a great team, and the more tasteful and skillful version are also acceptable to a degree (Insidious involves deception and being sneaky, which is better to me than brazen face-camping).

But it is a community game, therefore the only way to make it better is to consider the other people playing. You think any of us would try to unhook someone every time if there weren't points involved?  We all get points off of each other, and most play styles allow for both sides to get a chance for points....but facecamping actively prevents one side from the possibility of getting points. I can play a game as the killer and naturally have every person leaving that game with 10K minimum. A face camper leaves the other side to get almost no points, which I find selfish, but also detrimental to the community.  I don't want to only play a killer, but when I go survivor and it's round after round of face-camping killers and disconnects, under 5k points, with nary a killer to be found who have the confidence to leave a survivor in the hook and the mindfulness to stay proactive in a game.

"dkvhzv5","Society's expectations for women go back and forth. In the '90s and early '00s, it was all about being slim and svelte. Now it's gone on the other spectrum, with thick and curvy being in and celebrated. Maybe in a few years it'll change again. Kind of reminds me how in the 1950s, the hourglass figure was worshiped and heavily advertised, but the '60s brought the skinnier and leaner figure back.

"dkmcvib","I've been exploring Discord (on this sub's official server), and I also sometimes feel I'm not needed. Because truthfully, the conversation can go on with or without an additional person. But, in my opinion, everyone who isn't only spamming emotes contributes positively to the discussion. I have also accidentally offended people, but usually a simple apology is enough.

People are usually self-centered. I don't mean that in a bad way, like they are selfish, but more that they say things based on their own perceptions, and don't realize that others could feel differently about it. Drugs and alcohol are a good example, because people love to talk about them, but forget they're in a public chatroom/board. There are hundreds of people potentially watching, possibly some whose lives (or families' lives) have been destroyed by substance abuse. Or are just uncomfortable with the subject altogether.

Alternatively, if people are talking about something like depression, they're usually focusing on what they feel. If they focus too much on it, any help offered is dismissed. In my opinion, venting is only helpful if it is open and receptive. Simply talking about how angry (or sad or whatever)  they are will probably just make them worse, because they're only thinking about being angry/sad/whatever.

There's not really anything that can be done to change how people act. That doesn't mean you should leave, but understand that they have a different perspective, and try not to judge. If people are being morons, that's okay, they're just morons. Surely there are non-moronic things everyone can talk about.

Of course, dealing with people in real life is much different than the internet. You can't just ignore their problems as much as you can with random internet strangers. I honestly am not to sure what to say about real life interactions, unfortunately. It *really* depends on your situation, and I'm admittedly not the best at it anyway.",1500844221,"i don't mean that in a bad way, like they are selfish, but more that they say things based on their own perceptions, and don't realize that others could feel differently about it.","selfish, but more","selfish","but",TRUE,"selfish , but more","more",NA,NA,1
"dkmatux","My name is Bruce Verres. Skeptic, rationalist, author and TV personality. You may have read my bestsellers, ""*Why the world is better without God*"", ""*How to murder God*"" and ""*Where is this God dude, anyway?*"". Or you may have seen my documentary series on Channel 5, ""*The godless universe*"". The thing is, I am also God.

It all started during a recording session: a man in the audience had asked me to prove that God does not exist, so I invited him on stage and set up my time-tested performance. I looked up, lifted my middle finger toward the ceiling of the studio and proceeded to yell: ""Hey! You! Yes, I'm talking to you, you big cunt in the sky! Where the fuck are you? If you exist, if you're not just a demented fairy tale, a lie concocted by some sick fuck, let me see a little wrath! Come on, you cosmic pussy! Smite me, O mighty smiter!""

The usual reaction of the religious dupe in front of me is to reel back in shock at my cluster of blasphemies, while lightning completely fails to come into existence and strike me down. This time, however, when I turned to look at the guy again, I found myself looking down the barrel of a pistol. It all happened in an instant. The cry of ""Allahu Akbar!"". The muzzle flash. The explosion. Then everything went white.

No, not everything. The audience was gone. The studio was gone. I was standing in an infinite white space, but in front of me, less than an inch from my forehead, was a bullet, fixed in air. I touched it and tried to move it, to no avail. Behind me, I heard clapping. A familiar smooth voice said: ""Excellent performance, Bruce.""

I turned. In front of me, dressed all in white, was Morgan Freeman. ""Hi"" he said. ""I'm the cosmic pussy, I guess.""

I must have looked pretty shocked. My mind was racing, trying and failing to make sense of what was going on. ""No"" I said. ""This is not happening. You're not God. Why would an omnipotent, omniscient and omnipresent being look like a Hollywood movie star born in 1937?""

Morgan Freeman, or whoever the man in front of me was, smiled. ""It turns out that the combination of this affable face and this mellifluous voice is what makes my children the most comfortable when I talk to them"" he said. ""But you're a special case. You don't want comfort, you want to be shocked. Maybe there's another face you like better.""

His skin lightened. His hair darkened. His wrinkles smoothed out. His facial traits changed their proportions. Again, my mouth was agape. ""What the... You morphed into Jim Carrey!"" I exclaimed.

The mysterious man in front of me shook his head. ""No, I morphed into *you*. Turn around.""

Confused, I did. Behind me was now a full-length mirror, reflecting me and the strange environment. I was still wearing the same suit, but my face was not my own anymore. I now looked like Jim Carrey.

I screamed.

For the first time in my life, I had experienced *pure terror*. All my life I had been an atheist, all my life I had tried to demolish religion and superstition with logic, and now it turns out that there really is an intelligent creator. I felt light-headed and weak in the legs. I collapsed to the floor.

I don't know how long I lay there, but when I got up again, all the fear was gone, replaced by a feeling of resignation and inevitability. I turned and faced God. ""I'm ready"" I said. ""Send me to Hell.""

God, who now looked like Morgan Freeman again, laughed and coughed. ""You're not here to be sent to Hell"" he replied. ""You're here to replace me. You're convinced you'd do a better job than me. Every atheist does. This is the opportunity you have been waiting for. I will now touch your forehead, and then you'll have my powers.""

""Is this a time-limited deal?"" I asked.

""No, this is forever. I will just retire into a pocket dimension and watch."" he replied. He then pressed the palm of his hand against the center of my forehead, and I saw a bright blue flash. Immediately afterwards, I was in the Channel 5 studio again. The fundamentalist was now lying on the floor, with a pistol in his hand and a bullet hole in his temple. Everybody else was gone.

""*So now I'm supposed to have God's powers*"" I thought. ""*But it all feels the same. If I'm omnipotent, why don't I...*""

And then I felt it. It was like recalling a distant memory that had always been with me. I knew all the inner workings of the universe, I knew how to change it as I saw fit purely by willpower, I knew every request every sentient being from Earth or from any of the other inhabited planets had ever made to me. Most were petty and selfish, but a consistent minority would actually think big and ask me to improve life for their entire kind. I was omniscient.

With a mere thought I caused the entire Channel 5 building to disappear, and I walked toward the street. Meanwhile, I manipulated the perception of every person who happened to look in my general direction. Everybody would then remember a different, but coherent story about how the Channel 5 building had vanished, and they would consider it unimportant enough not to discuss it with anyone. Later, while I was walking down the street, I thought that maybe I should bring the building back, together with all the people who occupied it when it disappeared, so I did. I was omnipotent.

And then, with the same ease of taking a single step, I spread throughout the universe. I could physically feel every elementary particle, its position and velocity with an infinite precision (hello Heisenberg), and even what macroscopic object it was part of, just like I could feel my limbs when I was a mere man. I was omnipresent.

Finally, I knew what had to be done to improve everyone's life. There were four steps. The first step was to focus on everybody who had ever worshipped any divinity throughout their life. The second step was to temporarily transport each of them to a different pocket dimension they would identify as Hell. Then, I would appear to each of them at the same time, in the shape they would identify as their god or gods. And finally, I would talk to them.

""Salutations"" I said. ""Know now that you are in Hell, but this does not have to be forever. You have the power to save yourself.""

Some were scared, some were angry, some were resigned, but it was all part of the plan. ""I created you, and I gave you a brain to nourish with logic"" I continued. ""Instead, you spent your life worshipping me, ignoring logic in my name. This must end now! Worship is blasphemy! Destroy all your places of worship. Destroy every text, drawing, film or simulation that was ever made about me. Do not pray. Do not talk about me. Do not even think about me! Live a life of logic and rationality, and do the right thing, not to appease me, but because it benefits your fellow man! I will now return you to your lives, but be warned: if you ever start thinking about me again, I will immediately bring you back to Hell. Not after your death, but right there and then. Be godless, and you will be saved.""

It worked. Every sacred place, text or artwork was destroyed. Nobody worshipped me, nor anyone or anything else, ever again. All religious wars stopped, never to restart, and I saw that it was good. But of course, I knew it would.

Yeah, it's kind of selfish, but I think your wife is making an effort to spend it in a way her parents would have wanted: bettering herself and becoming a more whole person outside of work. Not so crazy and selfish honestly. Sounds like a person recognizing her own mortality and thinking about where she fits into the world. 

I'd give her some time, and suggest that she saves some of it for retirement or an emergency fund. I think she should use the rest for herself, therapy, and a nice trip and activities for you both to live it up more. Instead of all out quitting, suggest that she takes time off of work, or works less. There's nothing wrong with that if she's going to be using the time well. 

Sometimes being a little impractical is necessary. Life is short, what if she were to die tomorrow? Even more relevant since she's approaching 30. It's a milestone that makes you want to fit some more living into your life. This is probably the way she's thinking through her grief, and I think it's kind of beautiful and not necessarily a bad or self-destructive thing

"djv93rw","I don't think there is a hero or a villain in the musical (well, besides King George III). The point is that the characters are based on people, and those people are flawed. Your criticisms of Hamilton are correct, but does that make him a villain? Do his successes make up for his failures? I mean, even your points are largely ignoring the context:

* Hamilton wanted a war because he felt it was an inevitable result of the current system of British governance. He wanted it sooner rather than later so he could prove himself and get ahead. He was a kid who had lost everything and since he knew war was coming, he wanted to make the most of the opportunity. 

* Monarchy was the prevailing system at the time; why wouldn't he push for Washington to act as a king? It's what people knew and expected - the idea being that at least a strong Constitution would help hold back the power of the king and keep him from becoming a tyrant. 

* Correct me if I'm wrong, but doesn't the musical discuss that there's no right side to support in France? I agree that him betraying his promise to Lafayette is lousy, but it was also *pragmatic.* Per the lyrics:

&gt;You must be out of your Goddamn mind if you think

&gt;The President is gonna bring the nation to the brink

&gt;Of meddling in the middle of a military mess

&gt;A game of chess, where France is Queen and Kingless

&gt;We signed a treaty with a King whose head is now in a basket

&gt;Would you like to take it out and ask it?

&gt;“Should we honor our treaty, King Louis’ head?”

&gt;“Uh… do whatever you want, I’m super dead.” 

The entire cabinet debates are to emphasize that Hamilton is selfish but pragmatic, while Jefferson is idealistic but unrealistic. Again, Hamilton's betrayal of his promise to Lafayette is a lousy moral one, but the *best one for America.* Jefferson's insistence on supporting a foreign country struggling after they killed their own leaders when America is barely getting by is noble and *bad for the country.* It's a murky gray area, not a clear-cut case of heroes and villains.

* You'd have a hard time selling that Hamilton was an uncontrollable power maniac, considering he torpedoes his own career aspirations to prove his innocence of treason and allowed himself to be killed in a duel rather than letting Burr gain the upper hand. He's self-sacrificing for the things he cared about - and his own power wasn't at the top of that list. His legacy, which he enshrined not in his own name but through his policies and the direction of America, were what mattered to him. 

&gt;If Hamilton has been President, he would have been a dictator.

Eh, maybe, maybe not. We don't know and can't know. There's a good case to be made that he'd have been a lousy president, but any attempts to be a dictator would likely have been stymied by the very system Hamilton himself helped create.

So first off, the thing that was pointed out many times, History repeats its self, its a vicious cycle, fool me once, twice and three times, etc

But i think its more like the implications of the post on SCOTTS end that make it seem blatantly obvious

First off he says he's going to cancel the game he promised everyone after a massive cliff hanger he DID NOT have to do in the first place, a game that will be the conclusion to the fnaf franchise and the lore (for better or for worse), but he says ""EHHH ya know i wasn't feeling it""

Not only did he TEASE IT before he was far enough into development where he could even fucking tell if he LIKED IT or not, but he also says he is going to replace that CRUCIAL GAME with games like a Pizzaria Tycoon or Foxy Fighters, some GARBAGE games you would probably find on IOS 

And what kind of developer would have such a crucial game like this, a super important one, and say ""nope, mmmmm no, i will not let ANYBODY IN THE WORLD EXCEPT FOR ME and any body associated know about this super important game hundreds of thousands of rabid fans are eagerly waiting for, i will completely hide this game in the archive and let no other living souls know about this, completely shut everyone out"", i mean that is something a developer can do given it is their IP and they can do what ever they please, but that situation i SUPER FUCKING SCUMMY, even from the standards of a developer known for being a quiet boy who builds up a lot of mystery

He also wants to replace it with a VR game a very small group of people can even fucking play, a movie that has a VERY high chance to flop, and he even wants to prioritize the new book, worrying about leaving us on a cliffhanger in the books, likE HELLO? if you give a SHIT about cliffhangers, how about prioritizing the MASSIVE cliffhanger you left us on the MAIN GAMES? THE THING THAT STARTED THIS ALL? THE THING THAT X2 AS MANY PEOPLE CARE ABOUT COMPARED TO THE BOOKS? the books are like the bastard child of the FNaF Franchise

He's going to prioritize all these gambles, flops or overwise useless things over the thing everybody wants? that thing that has the HIGHEST chance of being a solid thing a lot of people will like? something that can make a shit ton of money!?!?!?! HELLO!?!?!?!

I can understand the point where it sounds so heartfelt, but i think thats because he realized all the other ""Trolls"" sounded super fake, he realized making it sound heartfelt and real would make it more believable

i mean if its real i will sound like a total asshole, but i do not give a shit? because even if its real it would be a terrible idea? i mean i know it sounds selfish but good LORD, if he doesn't like the game, drop it and come back to it later, there is no way you can cancel this in any capacity, rework it and come back, if he wants to take a break and spend time with his family and relax, do it, and tell is this, you can do all the over off-shoot spinoff things he mentioned AFTER this SUPER IMPORTANT game like WHAT!?!?!?!?!!

But i still refuse to believe this is real, FNAF 6 is not cancelled,i believe this is one of this trolls, i think its purpose is to tell us that FNAF 6 is a thing, and that he also has other stuff up his sleeve,

Now, I'm not saying that this is what happened, but *if* Corinne was talking to Jasmine and Raven the next day, saying things like, ""I can't believe I let things go as far as they did with DeMario. I promised my boyfriend that I would only kiss people, and if he finds out that I let a guy go down on me, he's going to be so mad!"" then it would signify to them that Corinne *did* remember what happened and that she might have ulterior motives for claiming that she was drunker than she actually was. In that case, if I were them, and I were seeing a woman make things up in order to evade responsibility, hurting a lot of other people in the process (cast, crew, production, DeMario, etc.), then yeah, I would definitely be focused on the frustration I was feeling over the missed sponsorships and not on her.

At the end of the day, the contestants can only be gross for caring more about sponsorships than they do about a sexual assault if a sexual assault actually took place. And at this point, since they're in a better position to know than we the public, I'm just not willing to cast blame or judgment on them before full facts come to light.

STR 8, DEX 16 (+1 race), CON 14 (+1 race), INT 10, WIS 12, CHA 18 (+2 race, +2 ASI)

Studded leather armor for AC 15

Carrying a rapier and an instrument as focus

**Cantrips:** Booming Blade (from variant), Mending, Minor Illusion, Vicious Mockery

**1st level spells:** Bane, Dissonant Whispers, Faerie Fire, Healing Word 

**2nd level spells:** Blindness/Deafness, Shatter, Hold Person 

Expertise in Persuasion and Deception

Vicious Mockery doesn't do a lot of damage, but it's a great debuff at low levels when enemies have only one attack. As you level up and monsters start picking up Multiattack, it's harder to justify aiming for disadvantage on a single attack, but it still has its uses. Combined with Cutting Words, that's two attacks a round you can prevent. If you use your first turn to land Bane or Blindness, that's more attacks that don't land on your party, which means more health for everyone. 

The way I see it, Bane and Faerie Fire are your go-to moves during the first round, and the one you use depends on whether you need to help your party land hits, or need to help your party avoid being hit. Also depends on where people are standing. Bane has the advantage of helping you land VM etc, so it's a selfish but understandable choice that still benefits your party. 

Healing Word is your go-to healing option, and you only use it to pick up fallen allies. If an ally falls, use HW as your bonus action and then use VM as your action. Never take Cure Wounds. 

If your party is mainly melee weapon attackers, they'll get a lot of use out of you having Hold Person. 

Once you reach level 5, Hypnotic Pattern is going to be your best friend. You can also start to be more liberal with your Cutting Words and maybe even Inspiration (I tend to save Bardic Inspiration for ability checks outside combat). 

I want to make one thing clear, though: your Bard is **your** character. Your party gets zero say in what spells you should take or how you should play up until the point you ask them for their opinion. If you want to be a support character who only takes healing spells and defensive buffs and then proceeds to use a crossbow all combat long, that's fine. It's also fine if you choose to pick up the few damaging spells that Bards get and spam them, or if you just want to focus on utility spells by taking all the rituals you can get your hands on and helping the team by finding magic items hidden amongst rubbish and by finding out information about the area by talking to passing birds. DnD is a cooperative game, so try to provide something helpful to the group, but what that helpful thing is is your choice and should make you happy.

"din65op","You say that rulership does not need to be legitimate, it only needs to be, but I think you're once again conflating can with should. Why is that a good thing that societies should strive toward as opposed to having a logically consistent set of criteria for legitimate rulership?

I've heard the argument before that self-ownership is selfish, but I think it's just the opposite. A core principle of self-ownership is that you can't coerce others for your own benefit because everyone else has the same rights you have. That means rules of behavior are universal and consistent rather than based on the interests of your own in-group at any given moment. Your duties are your responsibility not to violate anyone's rights. That's the opposite of narcissism. On the other hand, might makes right based worldviews are inherently more selfish and narcissistic, since realistically, might is going to be wielded by those who have it for their own benefit.

It's true that a correct idea can be expressed poorly, but I'm sure you see how it's a logical cop-out to actually invoke that principle in any kind of rational discussion. The implicit goal of making an argument is to show that your position is correct by virtue of the reasoning you offer. If your point is that you've argued poorly but your conclusion is correct for reasons unrelated to your argument, that's technically possible but there's no way to rationally engage with that position. I have no counter-argument to some hypothetical line of reasoning that hasn't been raised yet.

Also, I'm curious why you think people would want to live in the society you've described over a free society where a person can be safe in knowing that life, liberty, and property will not be infringed.

So then Republicans really don't want to take us backwards in time to another society, like you said before?

&gt;Both groupings want prosperity, conservatives for anyone they deem similar enough to them not to put their amygdalae in knots (not very many people) and progressives for as many people as possible.

So would you say that the Conservatives only help other Conservatives but Progressives only help everyone, even Conservatives? Or just ""as many people as possible?"" If so, wouldn't it make sense that Conservatives are also just trying to help as many people as possible, but by different means?


&gt;The conservative stance is a series of nested excuses, handwaves and rationalizations for selfishness.

I don't see them as particularly more selfish about anything except for how they want to see money spent. And they're selfish as a point of principle because they think they are better at choosing where to spend it than someone else.

"diei2kx","While I think ""bitch"" is probably too strong a word, I disagree with you. Her character is very selfish, but then again so is Tom and that's the point of the movie. Summer is at a point where she really doesn't care about anyone else but herself. She just wants to have fun and take things one day at a time without worrying about consequences. That's why she can be so affectionate to tom one day and give the cold shoulder the next, and why she ""leads him on."" She's doing whatever she wants in a whim without any real regard to him.    


But that's ok.   


Tom kept coming back and creating those expectations. He kept talking himself into waiting around for somebody that honestly didn't want to be waited around for. And then he gets upset when she won't conform to his expectations of her. He was being just as selfish because he was trying to hold her accountable for something she never agreed to.

"dhg065l","&gt;That's where I disagree with you. Nowhere in the definition of greed or greedy is there even a whiff of 'poor decision making' if you could point that out then perhaps I'll revise my view because I believe that's where we're butting heads.

Really? Because I see it *all over* the definition. Let's take a look:

&gt;An intense and selfish desire

1. Intense desire

A person who is acting under the influence of an intense desire is not acting rationally. ""Intense desire"" is essentially the definition of ""passion"" and we have the phrase ""crime of passion"" which means that the person's judgement was impaired in the heat of the moment, by an intense desire or emotion.

2. Selfish.

As I cited earlier, the definition of selfish is:

&gt;lacking consideration for others; concerned chiefly with one's own personal profit or pleasure.

If you are not considering others, then you are not taking into account all the relevant factors to the decision you are making, which makes it a poor decision. I would interpret the ""enlightened"" of ""enlightened self interest"" to mean that you are taking all relevant factors into consideration, including other people. Either you're taking others into account, it which case it may be enlightened self interest, or you are not, in which case it may be selfish, but it can only be one or the other. Either you are or you aren't.

I feel like the point where I disagree is that you seem to be equating ""selfish"" and ""self-interested."" I would consider the first to mean that you are so focused on yourself that you don't consider other people at all, and the second to mean that you are primarily concerned about what you want and may or may not think about other people (enlightened vs. unenlightened self-interest).

&gt;edit: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyEBXTL1Y3U the word 'greedy' used with zero hint of 'poor decision making'.

"dh792my","I see two big problems with your view:

1) The relationship you describe is fundamentally broken. If there is no reason they can't have sex and they both ostensibly want to be having sex, then her refusal is a deeper issue that needs to be fixed. Either she has issues that need working through or he needs to try harder. 

These people should just break up because they don't have any intimacy and they don't seem to care for each other. She won't have sex with him and he wants other women. 

Perhaps intellectually he should be able to have sex elsewhere and the relationship could work because she doesn't want sex but everything else is great. But that's very unlikely to pan out in reality so I only see your view applying in a fantasy scenario. 

2) Even in that fantasy scenario I don't see why there is an excuse for cheating. Cheating is not just a violation of sexual exclusivity. It's deceiving your partner and forging a romantic and sexual relationship with someone else without their knowledge. 

What is it in this scenario that allows him to deceive his wife when he normally couldn't?

I suppose what you're really saying is that if his wife doesn't let him have sex with other women, then she is cruel and selfish. But as with 1) they can just break up. He is not forced to be in the relationship.

It's not unreasonable for her to not want to have sex with him. That's not a cruel thing to do. It's not unreasonable for her to want a monogamous relationship even if she doesn't want to have sex.

You literally make the following argument:

&gt;I really have to question the logic behind Zero Requiem being an ""escape plan"". If we were truly going with this version of Lelouch being selfish and greedy, then there is no reason to enact Zero Requiem when he has all the power of the world in his hands.

I'm not suggesting you believe Lelouch to be selfish or greedy, but you're making the argument that **if** he were, he would not enact Zero Requiem once he had power. This is literally, word for word quoted your argument.

I'm saying this argument is flawed, in part, because you've positioned this version of Lelouch as an extreme case of selfish, greedy behavior that no one is defending. This is a classic example of a [straw man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straw_man) fallacy.

&gt;This is literally the whole point of my argument. How can you say that it isn't important and keep taking small parts of my argument out of context?

Again -- I have yet to take you out of context. Though I did, *at first*, misunderstand the argument you made (that you now claim you didn't make).

Honestly, since you still feel slighted, I've been looking over your original post several times, *trying* to understand what key point / argument you're trying to make.

I *think* it comes down to this argument (and you can feel free to correct me if I'm wrong):

&gt;If we were to seriously speculate on Lelouch's actions after his death, I do not think it matters whether he knew if he would survive.

I'm in part confused because you say ""after his death"", when I think you might mean after his ""faked death or his resurrection"", because those are the two views provided in /u/AlexAngely's post.

The whole purpose of /u/AlexAngely's post is to reconcile the views between people like myself (who believe that *if* Lelouch faked his death, he did so for partly selfish reasons) and people like him (who believe that Lelouch faked his death, but it wasn't out of selfishness), so in that sense that's why it matters.

Hence, the ""golden mean"" -- as in, perhaps there's a reason he faked his death that makes it not selfish, but tactical / righteous.

I am living with 2 other friends in a 3 bedroom house. The house we're renting at has been sold and we have until end of May to vacate. 

I've been looking for houses and saw a lot of good ones. However, person A has so many demands that we're running out of options. He wants a large shed, a backyard, and a large carport because he has two cars and a motorcycle. Oh, and did I tell you that it has to be super cheap?

His personality also doesn't match person B and I. Person B and I get along very well, and I'm thinking I should ask him if he wants to find a rental together, without person A. 

Now, that's cruel and selfish. But we're talking about a place I will live in potentially for a long period of time, and I don't want to lose great properties because it doesn't fit one of person A's many requirements.

"dfamqs9","Here it is, I can only find the unedited version for some reason so this is slightly strange and off.

There's a certain point where you can't cope any longer. When the emotional pain is too much. When you can't hold on, when you can't function well, when you've lost all hope. I've been there for a long time. Not really alive, no, but living. Numb, with all emotions and senses dull. I've lost touch with reality. Almost nothing matters to me, and if it truly was nothing that mattered this decision would be easier. I'm tired of nothing changing. I'm tired of trying, I'm tired of hanging on. I have tried. I gave up quite a while ago, really. Gave up hope of ever having enough control over myself. The little control I do have isn't gained positively. I've recently realized that control is my motive behind many things. I need control over my life. But I've also realized that's not going to be possible. No, I don't want to die. The things I do want are unrealistic though, and it will NEVER be enough for me. I want happiness, I want to be okay almost always. I want control over my own life, and control over others. I want freedom. And I've accepted that I won't get all of these, and if I do, they will be fleeting. They won't last, it will never be enough. So I'm choosing death. Death is unpredictable, death is a chance at something different. Sure, maybe life is more expected. Maybe death is worse. But I want to take that chance. I know for a fact that my life is not the worst it can get. But I also know that I can't deal with this. I've set a date for Friday. It may change, yes, in fact it probably will, but it will not be before then. A date calms me. It reassures me that I do have control over my own life, that I can make decisions for myself, that I have power. I believe suicide is selfish, but also brave. What scares me the most honestly is the thought that I will regret my decision when it is too late. When I've already dropped and have no control. I can get past these fears. The pain of life has become too much. So I'm making a choice. I'm saying goodbye, finally. Not now, but soon. Soon, it will change.",1490243991,"i believe suicide is selfish, but also brave.","selfish, but also","selfish","but",TRUE,"selfish , but also brave","brave",NA,"also",1

Yes if one gives etnicity as reason not to date a person this might be beceause one sees them less worth but if it is only attraction this doesnt have to have the implementation cause it is seen less worth.

Remember - the DM is saying up front - Good people need to be not completely selfish, which involves some level of sacrifice.

The captain is saying, as a fully realised NPC in a world we are imagining exists, that being Good is the keystone to adventuring.

This isn't even a hard puzzle: the captain is wrong. Evil or selfish parties totally can adventure and have fun for themselves, and in dnd they can ascend to near-godhood and rewrite the universe in their own image. However, the captain certainly has experienced many amoral or immoral adventurers coming to a sticky end, and believes that being Good is safer and better.

The first point was said by the DM, and is True. The second point was said by an NPC, and reflects that NPC's bias.

Finally, let's just note that if the players had been selfish but not stupid, they could have stolen magic items (at the cost of looking over their shoulders for a while, wondering if the shopkeep would investigate, and being cautious when interacting with the law in case questions came up). If they had been Good, they could have gotten the reward for returning the goods and had no further worries about consequences. They might even have hoped for a discount from the shopkeeper.

Trying to be around healthy people and experience life, without therapy, isn't going to fix this easily or even have a high chance of success, because your perception of the problem is filtered by the problem.

Look, you doubt me? I know that every relationship you've had has been with someone who had their own issues. How could I possibly know that? More appropriately, how could you never have wondered why that is, or tried to follow where that question leads you?

You are correct that your partner deserves happiness, and if you don't feel for her, she deserves someone who does. But the responsibility that imposes on you is to make that decision from a stable emotional position of growth, where you can know that it's the real decision that fits the more fully secure self your emotions are unhappily blindly searching to become. It would be the height of sadness for her, and stupidity for you, to take a decision to leave her for feelings you think are your true feelings, only to discover they were a product of your depression, your hunger to cope with the void through intensity (thus interpreting its absence as a lack of love by you) and shame, guilt and low self esteem.

The problem here is the feelings you've been using for your guidance system are actually being used to fill other purposes, and what you feel is love (and what you feel isn't love) isn't accurate. There are people who understand emotional architecture, and know how to adjust it. Making a decision like this at this point in your life and relationship without dealing with the underlying cause enough to be sure of it isn't fair to either of you.

And as far as the others telling you the opposite, their advice is good for the situation you described without reference to other factors. I'd give the same to you if you were secure and selfish. But you are neither. You are a basic decent guy who has been lost for most of his life, and you need to start walking towards the light at the end of the tunnel. You are entitled to dismiss what I am telling you and go with majority voting if you wish. But a part of you knows that what I am telling you gets at deeper drivers, and so to do so, you'll have to ignore that part and stay in the dream.

"dc7k0n1","The Last Five Years: Musical/Romance

I hadn't heard much before watching. The general premise is we follow a couple through a relationship/break up. The woman's (Anna Kendrick) point of view begins at the end of the relationship working backwarda, while the man's (Jeremy Jordan) begins at the beginning, with the two POV's intersecting at their marriage.

Overall it was an enjoyable movie, reminded me a lot of RENT. Both characters have their flaws, and are both fairly naive and selfish, but not unlikable. The storytelling is interesting, though can be confusing. There are a lot of scenes that I was not entirely sure about where they were supposed to lay on the timeline. I feel like a similar movie that did this kind of nonlinear storytelling well was (500) Days of Summer, where the jumps in time had a very evident storytelling purpose.

The songs are good, but not great. I can't say any of them were stuck in my head after the movie was over, though there are a few moments where they get catchy. Anna Kendrick sings great, but I feel like there are plenty of other movies where she is much more memorable. Jeremy Jordan is good, but he brings more personality to the singing than actual musical talent.

All in all, it was better than average, I could recommend it to people that really enjoy musicals, but I think the decision to jump back and forth may be off putting to some, especially when they don't do much to let you know what time you're watching apart from some background cues and years plastered on signs.

"dbl15y9","Would it be less objectionable to you if the power in question were anthropomorphic? Plenty of people in movies and books do things because they're forced to do them by someone with more power than they have, and plenty of those are initially reluctant and then come around. I don't know—it just doesn't seem particularly bad to me, especially since her initial foiling of his plan to leave her behind is *not* supernaturally aided: he shuts her in the cave, and she finds her own way out on her own initiative and swims after him.

I was bothered by the circumstances of that scene too, but not for the same reasons as you. The interference of the ocean and resulting slapstick masks the fact that what Maui is doing to Moana is incredibly cruel. First he not only maroons her on the same island he's been trapped on, but shuts her in a barren cave with no food or water except a few pieces of fruit. Then he tosses her into the ocean, which is certain death by drowning without the ocean's help—and if I'm remembering right, the first time he throws her overboard he doesn't know the ocean will do this for her. I think it says a lot about the emotional toll of his stint on the island, and how much he's not thinking straight, that he's gone from generous demigod to someone who'll straight-up *murder his rescuer*. This is part of the reason I was OK with the ocean interfering: the ocean isn't just doing this to help Moana, it's doing it to help Maui. Because in his right mind Maui would never do this to an innocent girl whose only crime was helping him escape, offering to help him restore his powers, and expecting him to do something for her in return instead of just fucking off (when, again, he could simply leave her after getting his shapeshifting back). This isn't so much like Han deciding whether or not to take Obi-Wan and Luke off-planet as it is like Han just leaving everybody in the trash compactor.

I was uncomfortable about how it was handled because I don't think the movie really emphasized the potential gravity of what he did. But I'm always bothered by this kind of thing in Disney and Pixar movies, and I think it's just a slapstick convention I'm not used to, and part of the price for keeping it a kids' movie. If anything, having that character development arc for Maui and having him so ready to sacrifice himself at the end meant it was more satisfyingly addressed in *Moana* than in most other Disney-type movies.

Edit: Also, I think it's important to emphasize that this level of interference is only the case at the beginning. If the entire movie were just the ocean whooshing them around like pieces on a chessboard or forcing Maui to help her, I'd agree with you that it wasn't satisfying. But I think it's crucial that Maui starts off reluctant and selfish but in the end is making decisions and sacrifices on his own, in the same way that Moana starts out dependent on supernatural help but in the end learns to sail the seas and figure out problems on her own. It really helped to reinforce the education and coming-of-age themes of this movie, and the way in which supernatural aid guides personal choice and the past guides the present was a large part of the point: they do so as a parent or a teacher does, with the goal of getting the person to act on their own.",1482597193,"but i think it's crucial that maui starts off reluctant and selfish but in the end is making decisions and sacrifices on his own, in the same way that moana starts out dependent on supernatural help but in the end learns to sail the seas and figure out problems on her own.","reluctant and selfish","selfish",NA,FALSE,"reluctant and selfish","reluctant",NA,NA,0

I had to read the news at university, every week, as part of my training. The only thing that helped me cope at least a little bit was switching to science news, because researchers have something to live for and none of them are under fire. Others in my class could just read about ISIS and Boko Haram and go do a brief report with impeccable grammar and style, and I felt too sick to actually talk about it. I was following Curiosity and other space missions and modern medicine because I couldn't handle the subject matter. Scientists, artists, artisans and volunteers make me feel so much better by existing. There's so many people who are just good in small portions, too.

But in my opinion there is something worse than either option; having kids even though you don't want them. Its narcissistic to think you have a duty to breed because your genes and wealth are 'just that good'. Even though you secretly feel your children are a nuisance, but you know that the deadline to being too old is coming up. I think having children you resent hurts yourself , your partner, the child and society.

The best thing to do is have a child if you want them, and can reasonably provide for them. Anything less than a loved child, is not only selfish, but wrong.

"d9tjnlf","&gt; we might as well split the country.

I'm starting to ask, ""why not""

It seems to me that there is a clear divide in the country, ideologically and largely geographically.  Bill Clinton promised to bring us together, George W promised to heal the divide, Obama stated there are no red and blue states, only the United States.

Yet the divide has gotten worse, and continues to deepen.  The level of hatred from both sides continues to grow as the middle ground shrinks and shrinks.  It starting to become clear to me that large contingents of the population *hate* other contingents and this is reflected in the continued decline of political rhetoric amongst our leadership.  I mean what's the first thing Trump is going to do as POTUS?  Undo as much of Obama's actions as he can.  Hillary won the popular vote but Trump won the electoral, the nation is the Disunited States.

I mean what exactly are we supposed to be proud of ""as an American?""  Almost every major issue or policy I can think of, from the economy to health care to taxes to the military to the environment is split clearly down party lines with totally different ideas.  Compromise rarely happens and when it does, we get the ACA which was just the worst of everything.  Progress is glacial in almost every area and fought every step of the way by both sides.

I've heard a lot this election about ""our culture.""  WTF is our culture?  Is it New York City?  Rural Kentucky?  Smalltown Texas?  The border states?  Miami?

I feel like the strength of America used to be its diversity - in people, geography, viewpoints, skills.  But recently, and especially during this election, I feel like its a weakness.  We simply cannot get along.  There are two vague visions of America, and they are quite different, and they are getting further apart.  Tensions between Democrat and Republican, between racial groups, between people who are pro this or anti that, its just getting starker and uglier.  I'm only 30 years old but the country seems less united now than it has at any point in my life, and I thought it was bad under Bush for a while, and during Obama's early years.  But this is something else.  I am really struggling to come to terms with the unpleasant fact that I actually *hate* a large amount of people in this country.  I don't want to feel that way, its petty and selfish.  But I can't just ignore it.  Maybe I just hate myself?  I guess I'm proud of the work our parents and ancestors did to build this country but I find little to take pride in now.  I look at the coming years and at my most optimistic I'm thinking ""Well I hope nothing catastrophic happens.""  And tbh I voted for Hillary but I wasn't exactly thrilled about that either and I don't think it would've changed how I feel if she wins.

I just see so little positive interactions between people about anything political.  Whether its on reddit, in person, watching pundits and people on TV, whatever.  Its just anger, hatred, blame-placing, over and over and over.  That or just complete dejection and borderline nihilism, or outright insanity.

I dunno man.  So much of this election season has been spent by Trump telling us the country is dogshit, a disaster, while on the other side Hillary calling the people in the country deplorable, racist, backward... its like what the fuck.  The rhetoric has sunk to such a low level I honestly don't know if it can ever again be elevated and to be frank President Trump doesn't exactly inspire confidence in that regard.

"d8pucdi","We have tried counseling once. He wasnt being open and honest. There was one time i was studying for the lsat to apply for law school and when i talked about it with him he made it all about him, telling me he wanted to go a while back and that he might take it with me. All of a sudden throughout the day he mentioned how HIS law degree would help in so and so situation. That was when i asked him to go to counseling. But of course he pretended he was joking even though i know he actually does think about law school. He even admits that he would like to go to escape his current job, now, 5 months after the counseling session.The counselor catered to his lies and narcissistic behavior which she said was necessary for people working as doctors so i ended it with her. Clearly she realized whose insurance was paying for the session or she was that careless to think selfishness should be condoned.
At this point hes trying not to ""joke around"" as he phrased it, which really means he is trying not to step over me with his arrogant ways. He doesnt come in between me and my goals but he doesnt talk much at all. We dont communicate well and when we do its only a short time before hes done pretending to be a good listener and goes back to talking over me. Im tired of waiting for him to understand. I cant ask him to listen every time i have something to say that i find important. I feel like this whole relationship is fake. Hes asked me before what i need from him and i said support. I dont remember exactly how i said it but for some reason he changed the subject to his own personality, implying he couldnt do it.  He said its never enough. That i cant make him change the way he is. The only thing i want is for him to be capable of listening and understanding. But for some reason that is tied into everything else. He is unable to reach out and ask whats wrong, yet he mopes around all the time looking miserable while im dealing with being pregnant and not working and cooking for him. 

Im tired of people telling me i need counseling. It doesnt matter if someone i dont care about is there to listen. If my own husband cant do that, whats the point of being married to him.  Im beginning to think im the only one who truly understands the nature of who my husband is.

100% agree with this

Also agree with this, you make a decent point about all of them being selfish to an extent and /u/Sh0tgun_Jacks0n is a bit excessive in his dislike for Chiho and Rise.

This is where I have to completely disagree with you. In my opinion, there is no true route in Princess Evangile, but My main reason for disliking your statement is that, I'm just not a fan of the idea of a true route. A ""True route"" pretty much invalidates all other routes, it makes it seem like it doesn't matter if you liked one of the other routes because they're not canon and that doesn't sit well with me. It's fine if Chiho's route is your favorite, I respect your opinion and I'm glad that you could get something more out of it than I could.

"d8aljji","Every single one of your points just seems like a mistake by your part. You should be able to judge when you can TP yourself. You should never TP too late and you should never blindly listen to others calling for TP. All of these things come from experience which you might lack.

It's true though, that TP isn't as necessary, especially in soloq after the nerfs.

Generally, TP is needed when:

* your champ has a much weaker laning phase and/or dueling (mostly tanks)

* you yourself think you need it in this certain match-up (so you don't get poked out, for example)

* you want to roam early so you can TP back just in case

Everything else you can do with it is just a bonus.

A common misconception is that you HAVE to gank with TP. Especially in soloq, often you need to pressure your lane a lot more first before you can attempt to make plays since there is so much less coordination. If you use TP smart, you can get XP and gold advantages which translates into pressure in your lane which you can use to get even more advantages maybe even somewhere else.

However, the very same concept can be applied to combat summer. People always assume you're trying to be a dick or something by not taking TP, they think it's selfish, but many times it's just way better to have a combat summoner so you can create even more pressure which could help the team a lot more than TP could.

As you are saying, there is a valid argument to take something else to get an advantages in some other way. I would not say that you are ""ahead of the curve"" though since you are just dismissing many of the qualities TP has or why many people take it.

Just take whatever you feel like you have a better chance of winning with and keep an open mind, maybe you find better reason for yourself to pick up TP again once you play the game more.

I'd argue the same can be said of any human-generated content. The human mind is shaped by its experiences, so naturally anything it creates would be directly influenced by those experiences, which are the basis for beliefs. Besides that, worldbuilding is usually used for storytelling, and storytelling usually has some sort of themes or concepts that it tries to convey. Creators don't typically generate content that makes arguments antithetical to their own beliefs unless they're under the influence of an incentive like a big wad of cash or the threat of harm.

For examples from my own work: Religiously, I am agnostic, so I tend not to give objective answers about the afterlife, creation, or the existence of deities in my settings.

"d71y3ox","It really depends on how they treat it. His character progression in the prequel should end where it starts in the OT.

If the OT character arc is about a scoundrel who's abandoned honor redeeming himself and finding a cause to dedicate himself to, then his prequel character arc should land him at dishonored scoundrel. 

Think of a classic Clint Eastwood character. The characters go through an arc, but it's not always a tale of redemption.

Basically, I'd like for it to not be it's own isolated arc for the character, but a really faithful and satisfying addition to the arc that's been established. I think TFA did a good enough job of this as a continuation and ending point for the progression.

As an example, the trilogy of books kind of went out of their way to make Han Solo sympathetic to the Rebels. But to me, it's more affecting that he gets swept into the Rebellion just as a means of escaping personal debt and then develops a devotion to the cause and his friends.

I don't need a Han Solo prequel to tell me why he joins the rebels. The OT does that. I'd like a Han Solo story that tells me more about what makes him who he is when Luke first meet him: a selfish but charming scoundrel, tied up in organized crime, loyal only to himself and his Wookiee companion.

I'm cautiously optimistic. Kasdan is writing, and it's a story he's been sitting on for decades.

"d71rfpu","My former roommate and best friend went down this path. I have been in your EXACT situation.

All I can say is - there's a reason he will forever be called a ""*recovering* addict."" There *is no* ""used to be."" Every time you see him doing well, your hopes will be lifted, but eventually you will realize that no matter  how long he stays sober and appears to be doing alright, the possibility fully exists for him to slip up and drag you right back down. If you continue to engage him, you will be forever dragged through this emotional turmoil. It is as heartbreaking a thing as I have ever experienced.

In my case, when I eventually acquiesced to his incessant requests to hang out (always at my place, because he was always staying with ""a girlfriend"" or at shelters), I began to notice items missing. I even would knowingly submit to things like lending him Xbox games or other electronics etc. which I knew to never expect back. It doesn't help.

Eventually one day, after not seeing him much for a year or so, and hearing peripherally that he was doing ""quite well,"" I saw him randomly on a main road and excitedly turned around....to witness him selling his food stamps for half-value in cash outside the 7/11. One guess what that cash was for.

My point is....remind yourself you will be dragged along an excruciating emotional rollercoaster as long as this person is in your life. You will feel every up and down as they experience it, and honestly by allowing him to live his life as though ""nothing has changed"" between you two you are in fact enabling him to live in a bit of denial about his condition. 

It's incredibly difficult, because you *want* to be supportive of your loved one when they are making strides to better their life, you *want* to pretend that you can offer them one comforting normative situation reminiscent of who they once were, but all that left me with was an old friend I felt nothing for but outdated loyalty, who was down forty pounds, missing his front two teeth, trying to tell me how it was all coming together while I paid for everything every time we got together. While he told me I was the only one who never abandoned him. *While he was stealing from me.*

He has to lose it all, he has to rock-bottom, and that is where his choice is made. NA, a path to a better life, better choices, perpetual recovery. He can *only ever make that decision completely and utterly on his own*, and a lot of people don't. I won't lie, most people never, ever come back. I live in the heroin capital of the US and have seen this happen to too many aquaintences.

There is no graceful way to do this.  You cut all contact. You don't answer his texts or calls. You stop hanging out with him. 

You say it's hard to separate the person he now *is* from the person he used to be. I know precisely what you mean. But you've said it yourself, and you have to remind yourself -- *this is who he is now.*

It sounds brutal and selfish, but he no longer possesses any value to add to your life, and you are not truly helping him by enabling him to pretend he's getting there when he is clearly not.

Just pull the trigger, mate. It's difficult, but necessary.

"d71nbcl","1) It seems like the straightforward answer is the right answer, and the crew simply weren't standing right next to Maxis when the Shadow Man was calling out to him. I mean, these men have literally been to hell and back fighting for their lives and the lives of the children and so much more. I think a little R&amp;R was well deserved.

2) Monty told Richtofen where the Kronorium (a book  with lots of knowledge in it) was, and from there Richtofen went to search for the summoning key. It would seem that Monty knows a lot, but not everything. He only knew where to find the information that was needed, so he sent Richtofen on his way, and then seemingly turned away until Gorod Krovi.

3) I am actually discussing this right now in [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/CODZombies/comments/505p89/in_regards_to_milos_revelations_timeline_video/).

4) The easiest answer is that Monty just sorta built him a body. The rules that govern Monty and the extent of his powers are still very unclear. But he either built him a new body, or found one for him.

5) there is no evidence that he spent any time with them during this gap. There is actually quotes of character asking where he has been if I remember correctly.

6) They were just showing the past maps along with Takeo's words. MotD just happened to be there because it is a fan service within the trailer. The same can be said for Nacht as our crew was never there, except for Dempsey.

7) I might be the only one that thinks this, but I believe Richtofen sent his own soul to the house as soon as he could, in case they failed to secure the other souls. That way, no matter what happened, his soul would be safe in the house. A little selfish, but understandable, especially for Richtofen's character.

All of these are theories, opinions, and most likely explanations. They are the best that I can think of and may be wrong, but at least they seem to make sense for now.

"d71mu5c","You really should not oversimplify your conception of what cognition truly is to being biological health markers that either increase or decrease a 'state of cognition'. 

To 'get cognition back' does not make sense in my conception of cognition. I do not dispute the factor of my possible naivety, but I think that cognition does not really change much throughout our lives. 

What does though is our strategies. 

Cannabis can reduce our previous strategies to the point that we may develop new ones, and these may be entirely dependent on our environment during intoxication. 

Building strategies that overtax our working memory and possibly our short term memory is what is termed psychosis by modern psychology. Psychosis is not necessarily wrong cognition. 

It comes down to philosophy. Psychosis can be philosophically undesirable for us subjectively. So for a specific example:

Psychosis #1:
* You've decided that missing out on sensory information is not good. So now you recalibrate your common habits to allow excessive information into your awareness and thus consuming working memory and short term memory. This will conflict with your daily life in this society which demands we use working memory and short term memory for petty tasks. You may also have newfound disdain for the meaninglessness and toxicity of your daily life. Because its true, our lives are statistically meaningless. Realizing this you may have trouble doing basic meaningless tasks such as brushing your teeth because now your cognition is attempting to find a solution to make life worth living. By doing this it dives ever-deep into the nature of universe, your subjectivity, your birth and death, solipsism and so on. 

Psychosis #2:
* You did not reach full consciousness. But you have began to instinctually and drunkenly reform your daily cognitive habits. Some part compulsion and another part depression, you have now tricked yourself into self-defeating cognitive paths. A common example of this type of psychosis is the 'tip of the tongue' phenomenon. It has been studied that the more you try to recall the memory that is at 'the tip of your tongue', the worse it becomes in the future. You basically dig a cognitive tangent-hole for the memory that is based on addiction to novel thoughts and boredom to habitual thoughts. This leads to the main issue with this psychotic pattern: boredom/addiction/depression. Anxiety and the consciousness of reality drives you to seek out distraction. Your behaviors become tweaky and fast paced. You become too familiar with comfort so that every moment of non-gratification is felt as suffering. So you develop habits such as fidgeting, constant novelty seeking, using drugs that alter the degree of conscious awareness or perhaps the degree of gratification or comfort. The major problem here though resides not within your own behavioral tendencies, but actually with reality itself. You are destined to die and suffer for many years as a human slave to richer people who are stuck in their own tunnels of security and paranoia. The distrust that we have for each other has evolved into the divide between the rich and the homeless. Homeless are too trusting and utopic minded while the rich and secure are too paranoid and selfish. 

But you cannot judge anyone based on anything really. Especially when it comes to judging good or bad. We should not feel ashamed either. The life we live is currently inevitable or so it seems. But perhaps if everyone can stop being so paranoid of each other, we could realize we have enough resources for everyone and we are all being stupid and crazy to not share them. 

As long as we don't live in Utopia, we live immorally, we live stupidly, we are wrong. This is said with art but also it comes down to true logic. Utopia can be defined as the most moral possible state that we can live our lives in. 

I say all this within my own psychosis and psycho-programming I've brought upon myself. 

I am on shrooms, cannabis edibles, amphetamine, huperzine, piracetam, noopept, mirtazapine, and perhaps more that I'm forgetting. 

Drugs aren't bad, addiction isn't bad, our lives and environment is bad. Our environment is foggy social chaos that is still naive to what it could potentially become. 

Wake up and realize the true potential cannabis and acid bring forth to us. 

Perhaps many who partake just develop coping skills based on the utterly terrifying realizations that these drugs **remind us once again**. 

And Mr. /u/stuntaneous do not be so foolish with your time and life. You speak to say someone else may not get their cognition back, it is only stubbornness that will hold them back and pain. I can easily see that your cognitive habits are inferior to mine in regards to intellectual development and potential to have epiphanies. You are scared to lose control just like you seem to believe the commenter you are replying to has.

But this is the fear that drives each of you into your own bubbles away from the clear light of reality. You dissociate in your own paranoia, un-explorative and defensive towards any perceived danger.

The only danger left here is from our own individual psychoses, not from the reality before us. It is a social problem, not a physiological one.

"d6fj29z","&gt;A good analogy is that if a woman is blacked out drunk and cannot consent to sex, does that mean you'd still have sex with her? Yes or no? A lack of an ability to consent doesn't equal consent but it also doesn't equal a lack of consent. So don't have sex with her right?

Fair enough, an inability to consent doesn't mean it's a yes. But you gotta evaluate it on a per-type-of-situation basis. An overwhelming majority of women will hate you for exploiting them after they wake up, so it's obviously wrong to do it. However, an overwhelming majority of people don't end up hating their parents and taking their own lives (don't worry, I'll address your argument about this), so it's reasonable to have a baby.

&gt;There are A LOT of factors that contribute to suicide: religious beliefs, access, gender, social class, and mental illness. Someone could be in total emotional agony their entire lives but won't commit suicide because they believe they'll go to Hell for it. That's not a good indicator of anything.

Of these factors, only ""religious beliefs, access"" can actually *prevent* you from committing suicide, so I'll address those. The rest of the factors only influence you to do so.

For religion: Look at atheists. Plenty of them have miserable lives, just like any of us. But their suicide rates are still not noticeably high. The only evidence I've found that atheists have a higher suicide rate seems debatable and even if true, it's minor. It's still a few percents, which means that even if my children are to become atheists with nothing to scare them from  death, they're still overwhelmingly likely to hang on until they die to something else.

For access: I can think of few situations where you can't find a way to off yourself. You'd have to basically be imprisoned. 1. Most people have access, but they still rarely do it. 2. This argument is only morally relevant to me if I know my child will be born into (or has a significant chance of getting into) prison. Most people have access, and very few people get into the situation where they don't. Yet an overwhelming majority of those with access stay alive.

&gt;&gt;most people think it's worth it

&gt;Definitely isn't true. But if even if it was, where do you draw the line?

I don't. You don't. They do. They're the ones who decide their lives are worth living. Their parents might have started it, but a majority of people still think it is.

&gt;Does it? Only if it's not your child that does it, right? What if every child you ever have ends up being one of the two? Would you continue to have them just to satisfy your desire for a family?

As far as I am concerned at the time of making that decision, yes, it still makes it a morally fine decision. Nothing wrong with assuming that my kid was going to be in the 98%. In fact, even if my child did take their own life at one point, there were many, many factors that would've led to that conclusion. My decision was not the first nor the last event that led to it.

&gt;Ignoring the bad numbers, it is still immoral. You can stop any percentage of suffering by not having the child. If you're really going to sit here and say: ""Yeah, someone is going to be miserable, but as long as it's not my child, it's fine."" That's really immoral and you also have no indication that your child won't be miserable. But you do have an 100% sure bet that your child will suffer. You're making the conscious decision to create suffering without consent. If that's not immoral then I'm curious as to what you consider immorality to be?

They have a 98% chance of finding life worth living, 2% chance of eventually deciding it wasn't. The amount of suffering is irrelevant, and I am not the one causing it. Again, there were many factors causing this suffering. From whichever landlord issued their eviction notice to whichever surgeon did their appendicitis operation when they were 14 to Columbus discovering this continent. Who do you blame?

&gt;But those people are only in danger...because they exist. Right? If their parents never brought them into a world where they can be paralyzed for life this wouldn't be an issue. But their parents cared more about having a family then what actually happens to that family. Do you see where I'm going with this?

If you want to just go up the chain of causation, why stop at the parents? Take it up with whoever built that road. Or whoever invented the car. Or the first micro-organism that managed to self-replicate.

The point is, there were many preventable decisions that led to them being hit by the car. The parent's decision to have a kid wasn't the first nor the last occurrence in this chain. And none of the actions in this chain were immoral. But I suppose, by your definition of it, they all were?

&gt;They aren't taking on any risk. All the risk the falls onto the child. That's another problem. ""Yeah, you can end up with terminal cancer and die by age 3...but I want a family.""

If I get terminal cancer and die after a year of pain, I'll still be glad I existed at all. I won't hate my parents for it. Most people feel the same.

&gt;""Yeah...we have no food, money, or clean water...but I want a family.""
Definition of selfishness.

It might be selfish, but that doesn't mean it's immoral. A doctor goes to work because they want money for themselves. The doctor's job saves lives. There, both selfish and moral.

&gt;You're comparing making ropes to making humans? Not a valid analogy in the slightest. Ropes are inanimate objects. Ropes can't suffer. Ropes can't die. Ropes aren't alive.

It's an analogy, it's not meant to be perfect. It's meant to compare the results of making a rope to the result of making a human. You said, ""Everything bad that ever happens to that child is YOUR fault,"" to which that analogy was my reply.

Here's another one: A firefighter rescues a boy from a fire. The boy grows into a serial killer and rapist. Is the firefighter the bad guy? He did his job, a highly-regarded and heroic job. Can you blame him? No.

Again, you keep going up the chain of causation. Everything that happened to the child is my fault? No, it was the fault of every event that lead to this, starting from the big bang. Many of which were also decisions, and many were selfish. But none knew their results, and none were immoral because of it.

&gt;You're confused, not everyone gets a shot at life. There are plenty of people born into abject poverty who will never escape. Some fetuses never make it to term. You have to be talking about living people because a non-existent person isn't here.

A better shot than none.

&gt;No baby = No suffering Baby = suffering, MAYBE happiness

Neither of which directly matters. What matters is that overall, regardless of suffering and happiness, most people continue to live as if life is worth it. Many people suffer and never know happiness yet still keep on fighting.

&gt;How is choosing to cause suffering moral?

Because the overwhelming majority of people don't mind the guaranteed suffering in the grand scheme of things. Most people still think life is worth living, regardless of how heavenly or apocalyptic it might be.

"d67mjtk","This sums up quite a lot of how I feel about being a dad. I love my daughter to bits and absolutely adore the time we spend together - when she's not tired, grumpy or having tantrums the fun I have with her in her little innocent world of imagination is genuinely my favourite way to spend time. Teaching her new things and seeing her develop is a wonder and joy beyond compare.

However, this does involve quite a lot of sacrifice. I sum it up to my non-parent this way: without kids, you are on the Starship Enterprise- free to boldly go wherever you like, meet strange new people and generally do what you want. With a kid, you are on the ISS- stuck in a fixed orbit around a particular body. You might be able to enjoy the occasional spacewalk, but you are pretty tethered.

Simple things like getting up, getting better showered and going for mildly hungover Sunday brunch are either impossible or extremely difficult. You can go, but it almost certainly means sacrificing some strict parenting rules about nutrition and discipline to placate them.

Today, my wife and I need to go and get a mattress. Fairly straightforward without a kid, but with one it's a living nightmare. One of us will have to have eyes on at all times which makes a considered, mutually acceptable purchase impossible. What usually happens is that the salesman splinters the Mrs off and sells her the full shebang with aftercare, resulting in a later fight between us.

Our woes are compounded by the fact that my wives sister has two kids and is fairly... Not quite selfish but needy and unheeding of other people's needs and feelings and not respectful of anyone's time. She takes up 90% of the grandparents allotted childcare time. They are much more social than us too. She books a calendar of nights out weeks and months in advance, often asking us to watch one or both kids meaning my wife and I struggle to get any quality time together. That's more a gripe about my situation than parenting per se, but it feels good to vent.

The other thing I find is that parenting is like a good (hard) video game. As you get better and acquire more skills, the difficulty increases. Just as you conquer one thing - changing nappies for instance, a new one begins such as toilet training. You're never on the curve.

For these reasons, we aren't having another. Not anytime soon anyway.

"d4t16qq","I suffer from the same thing. I get very upset/angry, much like I did as a child, *when someone reads my comment uncharitably* (i.e., chooses to interpret it in a way that makes it seem stupid, even though there's a much more obvious interpretation that is quite reasonable). 

Secondly, I get upset not so much about what's said in response to my comment, but rather the fact that there's someone out there who is actually trying to make me upset, i.e., trolling. Circularly, yes, but my lizard brain doesn't bide much by logical fallacies. I think what makes trolling so upsetting is *how akin it is to being ganged up on*. When people gang up on me, they've all agreed that they're more interested in 'winning' an argument (i.e., making their opponent upset) than in compiling an argument. Also, there's something very personal about being ganged up on; it's *me* those chosen to do this to. That makes me very insecure and paranoid. ""Why did they choose *me* in particular? Is it because I appear weakest/most susceptible to derision?"" I was often the butt of the gang's jokes growing up, so I feel the pain of this on various levels. So even though one troll comment doesn't constitute being ganged up on, I still feel as if the troll's malice is the same sort that would go into ganging up on me.  (Also, what hurts about being ganged up on perhaps most is, even though some people chose to not gang up on me, they also chose to not defend me. I take that very personally, as a breach of faith and trust. So when someone makes an obviously trollbait comment in response to a bonafide comment of my own, and no one comments in my defense, I feel betrayed.) 

Lastly, I get very upset on Reddit simply because there are so many people out there who are, simply put, selfish assholes. It's one thing to, say, be a libertarian (which I very much oppose, but irrelevant to this point) but entirely different thing to be selfish and hypocritical. When I sense that people defend certain -isms merely because of a set of beliefs whereby only they themselves profit and then decide to defend their position not by admitting the truth (that they're selfish) but rather that it's good or truth or right, I become enraged. It's one thing to be selfish, but something much worse to being both selfish and disingenuous. 

To answer the question: ""Why do I continue to participate in arguments that historically make me upset and accomplish nothing?"" Well, I assume it's like steam control. I gotta get a bit bloody occasionally, lest the anguish eating me up inside will manifest some other (possibly detrimental to your actual life) way.

&gt;What if God was one of us?

I could buy it. Mind you, I think I said already that I'm a little iffy on Bran becoming so important - R'Hollor and various other prophecy-makers kinda... set half of the story in motion. For example, Ghost of High Heart has an even bigger probability to be connected to Old Gods/Bran, and her TPTWP set the course of Targ dynasty for the past... 50 years or so. I don't doubt that GRRM would write this ""Godly"" Bran with human flaws, but still, seems *too relevant* to me.


&gt;Kingsmen: The Once and Future Kingsmen

&gt; Local God Ruins Everything

IMO, you could (very) roughly split ASOIAF characters into ""progressives"" and ""conservatives"". From the beginning, Davos was a progressive - his very nature as former-smallfolk demands it, only he was raised up by a conservative. While Jon was raised by a conservative, but his experiences taught him differently. I agree that their arcs will take them further into questioning the status quo. Which brings me to...

&gt;Brother Ray and the Hound, the High Sparrow and Jaime/Tommen/Margaery, Kinvara and Varys, Beric, Thoros, and the Hound, and even Jaime and Cersei.

I think this questioning of God/King is part of the bigger theme of the last 2 seasons/books, and that's *revolution*. When we come to progressives or potential progressives, you have: Jon, Arya, Sansa and Tyrion to an extent, Davos, Brienne, Jaime, High Sparrow, BWB, the Hound, Asha, DANY. 

I don't think this collection of characters that learned better is an accident. Some are reactionary like the Faith, many are mixed like Dany in that they want change, but they'd like to keep their ""I keep my privileges"" cake, too. 

But IMO it's a good start - those are the people ""that shall inherit the Earth"" once the Ragnarok settles down (however many of them survive). 

&gt;Now, I think the notion that Jon doesn’t want to be brought back is weird and illogical in this scenario,

Naah. The way I took this season and esp. this last episode: Jon basically.. gave up. IMO it's selfish BUT understandable that he doesn't want to be the toy warrior you mention in your Azor Ahai work. As he comes back, he's not only had a traumatic death-state experience, he *lost and was betrayed* for doing what he thinks is right - his very foundation is shaken up. So Sansa guilt-trips him into helping family (when all he wants is to get a tan on some beach, Realms of Men be damned), but there's only so far he'll fight even for his family/revenge. 

And you can see it when Rickon dies: he sort of decides ""well, suicide by cavalry is OK I guess"". He totally gives up for a few moments  when he's being crushed. THEN he decides to fight - he's finally truly reborn (Mel can heal the body, but spirit is something else), the way the scene is shot is no accident.",1466727659,"imo it's selfish but understandable that he doesn't want to be the toy warrior you mention in your azor ahai work.","selfish but understandable","selfish","but",FALSE,"selfish but understandable","understandable",NA,NA,1

On the contrary, staying is in fact the worst thing you could do, you continue to finance a losing battle with your energy and passion, which is frittered away paying the bills for mindless hordes who are doing nothing but destroying the very foundations of everything you are trying to accomplish. It is a kind of marriage to a civilisation that is interested in you only to the extent that you can finance their existence flinging shit into the ditch to destroy what you cherish and produce, and it is a betrayal of yourself and everything you value to let them parasite from you in such a way.

My ideology has killed no one but fascists. Stalin and mao are not part of my ideology.

&gt; So...it's a moral imperative that I accept an ideology I disagree with, but you're immune to that? Any reason that isn't hypocrisy?

Fascists and reactionaries cannot be stopped with words. They will snap up and bit the hand that spared them. allowing fascism is supporting fascism.

My ideology is love and respect for all people around the world. yours is hate and fear of others for whom they are. We are not on equal moral footing here. The only reason I can think of to allow fascists to go unpunished is the fallacious slippery slope, and that's a fat load of horseshit.

No shit. The rich people are oppressors and oppressors are to be fought.

&gt; You think all those groups want to be your comrade? The middle east would stone you, africa would chop your head off.

Fascists have the middle east by the balls. Remove the fascists, give the people freedom and equality and that hate will disappear before you know it.

&gt; I'm not a capitalist. I'm more of a fascist without wanting to kill people.

Unreal. An admitted fascist. Traitorous scum.

&gt; After you get your marxist pipe dream, what will you do with that freedom?

No more poverty or hunger means less crime, less ignorance, less hate. Science can grow and develop with no fear of losing their funding. No pigs steal from the proletariat any longer, we are masters of our own fate. The government exists to stop capitalists to resurface and destroy fascism at the root. Over time, toxic religions disappear, bigotry fades away into nonexistance, and eventually the state will disappear as well, and so does the nation. It will be peace at last. DO you want to know what communist society looks like? Have you every watched Star Trek? (TNG and past that, of course, TOS is somewhat dated) That is communism.

&gt; Neither would that happen under fascism or a true capitalist society.

And you call me deluded. Capitalism is based around exploitation. The person who has something needed has complete dominance over those who need it. The USA.

In fascism, the party can do whatever the hell they want.

**1 of 2**

**Chapter 340**

What an exciting start for the volume, Naruto channeling his inner demon fox powers and charging at his enemy with his newly developed Jutsu that not even the so highly praised fourth Hokage managed to create...

... and it fails... how anticlimatic... really what was the point of this whole exchange?

It makes Kakazu look stupid for falling for this obvious trick and getting caught even though he's supposed to be oh-so experienced...

... and it makes Naruto even more pathetic, he needs to be rescued by his senseis like a little baby and has put himself and everyone around him at risk, once more, just so he can try out his new toy in a life and death situation.

And then he follows that up with some absolutely insane and asinine reasoning, about having to ""cross a bridge"" alone and everything... what would this even accomplish? This isn't some sort of test, this is a life and death situation with real stakes. This isn't the time to ""prove yourself to yourself"" or anything. Naruto even aknowledges that he is being stupid and selfish. 

But it's all well and good and we're supposed to root for this lunatic because it's all for the sake of Sasuke-kuuuun...

2/5


**Chapter 341**

Kind of cool how Kakazu has multiple configurations for his tentacles and everything, though we never see much of this and really get a good feeling for the differences.

And for all of his supposed battle experience Kakazu sure didn't see it coming that his opponent might vary up his tactic just a teeny little bit... 

Just like I asked for the previous chapter... what exactly was the point of Naruto failing the first time? It was an absolute waste.

And oh yeah, having a super big flashy Jutsu that leaves the victim in super critical condition surely will help to bring Sasuke back home anyway... I guess Naruto really doesn't care in what state he's bringing Sasuke back as long as he can strap him to a chair or bed and spoon fed him ramen.

2/5

**Chapter 342**

And here's another thing that really bugs me... last chapter made it look like Naruto actually did it, he actually finished someone off, he actually killed someone, which is a huge step foward for him as a character... he's willing to cross that line to defend himself, the people he cares about and other Jinchuuriki... but nope!

We can't have meaningful character development or anything, nooooo... Naruto has to stay pure, he has to be the perfect messiah, the ""eternal Genin"" who becomes Hokage without ever having killed anyone at all.

It's pathetic, it's absolutely pathetic on all levels... 

But speaking of character development, at least Shikamaru gets a good few lines in, him trying to cut out his lazyness and revealing that the ""most precious piece"" in the ""game of life"" is the next generation and all... I really like this metaphor, even if it is a bit cheesy.

However this chapter offers even more things that bug me... for one we get this often repeated message about how the younger generations will surpass the previous and I don't think this holds quite true which is especially obvious during the great Ninja war when the Ninja of previous Generations prove themselves to be much more impressive than any current ones. And then you have stuff like reincarnation and destiny and it all gets really blurry.

Also I just love how Tsunade is kind of taking credit for the whole thing, like ""Yeah good work everyone"" as if she did anything right here. She was just lucky it finally turned out good for once... and she was actually against this mission.

And now it's time for the really long Sasuke arc... oh boy... 

And the opener to this pretty much sets the tone for disappointment. We see Sasuke sitting admist hundreds of Shinobi which he was able to effortlessly dispatch off... but of course without killing anyone, after all Sasuke is a good guy and we can't our heroes do bad stuff!

I mean just imagine what kind of contrast it would be if while Naruto can't even finish off a direct threat, Sasuke slaughtered hundreds for breakfast training... well at least Sasuke crosses that line later.

**Chapter 343**

Orochimaru thinking that Sasuke ist an even greater genius than he ever was is really pathetic, not only does Orochimaru really sells himself short, but this is just really lame hype for Sasuke in my opinion.

Defeating nameless filler nins just isn't that impressive, not anymore, even in these numbers, because thanks to the massive levels of power inflation we already witnessed... we're long past that point. We began the post-TS content with people who could solo villages and countries (if you believe Sasori's claim).

Sasuke turning on Orochimaru also isn't really a big shocker and just strikes me as... damn I need to get a thesaurus or whatever you call it to find more ways to say pathetic...

Also I really beg to differ when Sasuke claims he has nothing else to learn from Orochimaru... it's a trope I generally dislike though I'm willing to be a bit more forgiving here than for example in Star Wars (where this caused a massive loss in knowledge and power for the Sith for followed that whole logic of the student killing the master as soon as the student was able to)

Anyways... we also get a bit of Konoha things still and they are as pathetic as you would expect... 

The whole Hospital flashback basically proves that Naruto has mental health issues as he is ignoring physical harm to his own body and is even happy about it, because it ""brings him closer to Sasuke""... I mean by now it shouldn't be a suprise that Naruto's obsession is self-destructive... but we're supposed to admire this? 

The only kind of funny thing is that Sakura has a fair point when she states that Kakashi usually spends the aftermath of every battle in a bed...

2/5

**Chapter 344**

Sasuke's reasoning here is really lame... he declares himself to be more powerful than Orochimaru, which is only really true because Orochimaru is in a weakened state. 

And all the nonsense he is rambling on about the Uchiha and stuff... just so pathetic... pathetic pathetic pathetic...

Orochimaru turning out to be like a super Goa'uld or whatever, some parasite who possesses bodies... it's really weird. I admit that I never really got this whole part because it's just so damn inconsistent over the entire manga. I guess it's just one of these things you really aren't supposed to think too much about.

To say something good for once though, Sasuke's CS2 Form looks much better with the fitting outfit.

And Orochimaru's backstory is actually pretty good in my opinion... it's kind of sad we only ever really get to see this beginning and the ""ending"" but never much of what happened in the middle. Like how Orochimaru really got his motivation, how it slowly shifted, how he descended into madness, how he got rid of any moral restrictions etc.

"d2zww5h","I'm going to try avoiding spoiling anything because I don't know how far along in S3 you are, but I feel strongly about this topic because I think Liz is a realistic character. People don't like her because they think she's generic, or petulant, or annoying and petty. Which certainly, many of these characteristics do ring true, she undergoes a lot of character development (or at least learns more things about herself), and that changes her as a person. I don't think she can be reduced to just a couple characteristics. Also, her relationship with Reddington (I wrote Reddit at first lols) is a point of contention. I think it's very complicated, and I'm going to briefly go through the seasons and hope that all of this makes sense.

Liz states in Season 1 that she raised herself and can display narcissistic tendencies - this raises two important things; she has both mommy and daddy issues since she has almost no memories of being raised by them. The only thing she remembers from her true childhood past is the traumatizing house fire. In her mind, her mom left her and didn't want her, and she doesn't know what happened to her father because her memories are fuzzy/locked up. [SMALL SPOILER](#s ""As we see later, she finds out the truth about her mother and father"")

Then, Reddington comes into her life and the only thing she can think of is that *he* must be her real dad (or else why the fuck is he in her life now?), but we find out it's more complicated than that. Reddington had placed Tom Keen into her life - so now, even the life that *she* thinks she built herself was a sham. This both destroyed her marriage and the entire life she had ""built"" for herself - I think anyone who went through that would be destroyed inside because nothing she did was of her own ability. She didn't even find Tom on her own, AND she fell in love with him - this is a huge failure to her as a profiler and a huge blow to her ego/psyche. She clearly feels betrayed by Reddington. Red also killed the man who raised her - her father Sam - to hide more of his own secrets. Red can't be honest with Liz, yet she's expected to fully trust him with her life just because he knows all the right (really, wrong) people. Eventually, Liz can't tell what is a lie or what is a truth from Red - that's really fucking frustrating to deal with, when you're friends with someone and sometimes they tell you the truth and sometimes it's a lie, and you have to dig through all the shit to figure out what is what. But Liz is a very caring person - she still cares for Tom even after all the shit they went through, and it's reflected by her team (Cooper, Aram, Ressler, Navabi, etc.). She still cares for Reddington even after all of the monumental shit he literally dragged her through.

Pretty much all of these issues and problems revolve around Reddington's own ego and arrogance. Liz has no idea why he's hiding these things from her, and he says it's to protect her, but think about how you would feel if somebody tried to protect you from something you didn't want to be protected from. He believes he can protect her better than anyone else in the world, but really he's protecting her from *himself*. It really would have been better if he had just stayed out of his life, but he wanted to be in her life and atone for all of his mistakes and sins (he also calls himself a ""sin-eater""). Reddington's motives are consistently **fundamentally selfish**. We see this in every damn episode where he brings a case to Liz's team - he has a motive. And we continue to see how selfish he is about her throughout season 3.

Don't get me wrong, Red is a great character and his love for Liz is very real (and also very selfish). But he is also huge fucking asshole and leaves behind problems and bodies wherever he goes. Knowing these things about Red and how he's impacted Liz's life really helps put it into perspective for me whenever Liz goes off on him and acts super cold and icy. Because Red never displays anything but love and concern for Liz, we see Liz's responses as petty and selfish. But really, Red is the truly selfish one in this relationship.

Edit: Also just for clarification's sake, this is not a Liz vs. Red comment, it's just an explanation as to why Liz acts the way she does and why I think her actions are understandable, even if we just want to smack her across the face sometimes haha. Red is great to watch (probably because he borders on sociopathic), and Lizzie is kind of a toddler dragged along for the ride.

I'm no expert and this is almost exclusively based on anecdotal stuff, but even the way he freaks out 'feels' more like OCD than Asperger's.

I liked Hillary's experience, but she was old hat with baggage. Overall though, I was leaning Hillary just based off of electability.

As this season has worn on, I've grown to despise the online Sanders presence as a whole. To put it simply, they are rude bullies. I can't use social media anymore without being slammed with anti-Clinton propaganda. I want to make it very clear, that I am *not* seeing pro-Sanders comments from Sanders supporters anymore much, but rather anti-Clinton ones. They quickly abandoned their happy campaign, and have been all too quick to forsake their original principles in favor of the typical political gamesmanship that they decry as being tools of the corrupt. It is completely hypocritical when they talk about super delegates now and the negative campaigning. I wonder how long it'll be before they start shouting ""four legs good, two legs better.""

As for Sanders himself, I'm very conflicted. Like most, I think he's genuine in his beliefs. I think that Devine and Weaver have pushed him into a direction he didn't want to originally go. But I also 100% think that he has an enormous ego, and he is out of his element. He has shown no interest in foreign policy, or really anything other than the prime issues he's discussed of wage inequality and corporate greed. Numerous articles have been written that state he's stubborn to embrace things he doesn't have a keen interest in. And he's an intense micromanager. Well guess what? The presidency requires attention be given to every area. And you have to be able to effectively delegate power and decisionmaking, otherwise you accomplish nothing and get bogged down in minutiae. Unfortunately, if you don't have a grasp of the ideas to begin with, you have no idea about whether a proposed advisor is good to begin with, because you have no idea about whether they know what they're talking about or not. 

I also think he's willing to destroy the democratic party to get what he wants. Which makes sense, because he's not a democrat. And he's not supporting anyone other than himself at any level of government. This is incredibly selfish, but also antithetical to the basis of his campaign, which requires revolution down the ballot. Unfortunately, he doesn't want to talk about it, and many of his supporters don't care about the nuts and bolts of getting the legislators in power to promote his policies in the first place.

"d1sv0qx","**Episode 3: On Actions, Consequences, and Perspective -OR- The Throwaway Episode That Wasn't**

This episode is notable for being, as many would attest, one of the most forgotten of all the episodes and events in the first series. Perhaps even the most in the entire franchise. It's not surprising, either; the actual events in this episode are unnecessary to the plot of the story, and it comes in between episode 2, where we get the first two fights and our first explanations of what's going on, and [spoiler for safety's sake](/s ""episode 4, where the real story begins and our heroine's counterpart from the opening credits makes her appearance."")

For many, the most notable part of the episode is the reveal that Nanoha can use her sealing magic from a distance using what amounts to a magic beam cannon. Throughout the episode we continue to get the already-presented technological feel from Raising Heart, culminating in her long-range sealing form, but other than that, the show has jumped back to being almost entirely a pretty standard mahou shoujo anime. A good portion of the episode is comprised of the [slice-of-life segments](https://i.imgur.com/D7Anlxq.jpg) before the monster reveals itself that is found in many mahou shoujo shows, and the opponent for Nanoha's fight is introduced and dealt with in typical monster-of-the-week manner.

Character-wise, [a little throwaway line](https://i.imgur.com/aul6lpm.jpg) also indirectly speaks to Nanoha's growing confidence she expressed in the opening scene. The little girl unsure of what she should be doing from the first episode is growing stronger, and her father sees it, despite not recognizing it for what it is yet. It even shines through her fatigue from the last few days of work, so brightly it shows.

But none of this makes the episode particularly noteworthy. It's still considered a throwaway episode by many.

So when I say that this may also one of the most important episodes in regards to everything in the story that comes after, I'm not saying so lightly.

The final scene of this episode is Nanoha [looking over the damaged city](https://i.imgur.com/0F9l0hF.jpg), and then walking through it, with guilt in her heart. She knows she could have stopped this situation from ever occurring if she'd acted decisively when she saw the Jewel Seed being held by the boy earlier in the day. Yet she didn't. She hesitated because she doubted herself and what she saw. And thus she looks upon the consequences of her decision. She's upset with herself, with her -- ultimately selfish but understandable -- decision not to take action when she saw the Jewel Seed. It fueled her determination earlier, allowing her to muster the strength to do both a ranged search and a ranged sealing blast, but now she is left again only with her sadness. It's her first failure.

But from that failure emerges a new-found determination. She takes on the task of collecting the Jewel Seeds as her own and not just something she's helping someone else do. But even more than that, she gains a perspective from her failure that drives her to never again hesitate when doing what she needs to do. To always give everything she has in all her future endeavors so that others will not suffer. She will not allow herself to fail again.

It's a perspective on life that makes Nanoha the person we truly know and love her as through the entirety of the rest of the franchise. Nanoha isn't truly Nanoha until this very moment. We will see the results of this, how it shapes her's and others' perspectives and lives, from this point onward.

The problem isn't too many DDs in a battle. It is the players around the DDs who are the problem.

Nobody will want to play a DD when they are intentionally targeted, with the idea that they are going to be sunk within the first few minutes of battle, with very little XP or credit gained.

In fact, the way the game is scored, if a CA can destroy two DDs, I guarantee you top five in post battle rankings. That is where I find myself almost every battle when I go DD hunting and succeed.

And this:

I wouldn't say teamwork or communication is a requirement to winning a battle. It certainly helps.

What I'm saying is players themselves have to be less selfish. By being less selfish about A. Surviving the battle &amp; B. Playing the role of support. A player can actually gain huge XP and credits if less selfish. But most players, even at high tiers are stupid and selfish and don't realize it.

They still think a kill is ""worth"" more than capping... Hell, simply put, they just think that individual achievements are worth more than team achievements, which means winning. Worth more to them, but nobody else cares. 

Until that attitude changes, we will see DDs being played because ""people"" are saying that is what to play. Not that it is what should be played.

Change the attitude and you change the game meta away from DDs in great numbers. Don't change the MM to change the meta, that only sets up greater and more frequent unbalance.

"d189t17","(Apologies in advance for the wall of text, I got quite carried away with context...)

See, yeah, same there, too. This was my very first relationship--he and I had been dating since 8th grade and spent all of high school together. Over those four years, we'd fallen in love. I was actually ready to marry him and commit myself to him. Even at the age of ~17-19 (for perspective I just turned 20 a couple months ago, so this whole shitshow is still relatively recent-ish) I was sure I wanted to spend the rest of my life with him.

And then the summer we graduated (2015), everything went to absolute shit. I thought things had been completely fine, then less than a week--no, *12 hours* after I watched him get in his mom's van and head off to college at the very start of September, I got a text that night saying he didn't think a long-distance relationship was fair to either of us and he thought I needed/deserved someone that could be there for me physically and emotionally since he couldn't anymore. He claimed he still loved me along with this.

I was so confused. I wasn't expecting any of this at all. I had been planning to make the distance work because I cared about him more than anything in existence. He was everything to me. And now this. I didn't understand. Was I not good enough? Did I do something wrong? I asked these questions (among others), and when it came to me doing something wrong, that answer surprised me--""other than the problems we already had, no."" *What?* I didn't even know we *had* any problems. This utterly perplexed me, so I suggested we talk things through and try to work whatever those problems were out, because I had no idea what he was talking about.

So we talked about it--for like, a day. After that I kept trying to continue the discussion because I knew we still had things to work out, but I couldn't really get ahold of him. I just figured he was busy because he was just preparing for/starting college, so it was easy to kind of brush it off. And then, less than a week after he'd left, after a little bit of talking, he dropped another bomb on me: he still wanted to break up. This only compounded my confusion. Again, was I not good enough? What had I done wrong? Didn't he love me? What about fixing our problems? But I couldn't get any good answers out of him. All he'd say was it wasn't that I wasn't good enough, I hadn't done anything wrong, it wasn't about fixing our problems anymore, and that he just didn't want a relationship. That led to more questions--did he not want one at all in general, or was it just not one with me? No good answer there either. I remember trying so hard to understand why and even at one point begging him not to do this, because I really cared about him and wanted to fix whatever was wrong. I fought and tried to hold on to the relationship.

So as expected, this absolutely crushed me. I was completely blindsided and heartbroken, plus extremely confused because I could not understand any of this. So, I made stupid mistakes and kept asking different stupid questions trying to make sense of this, because I just did not get it. Over time, I learned that I'd been behaving badly without realizing it--I'd been possessive and selfish. But I'd been completely unaware that I'd even been doing it. I didn't have any idea of how bad I was acting. The minute I found out that he'd left me because he realized he couldn't deal with my behavior for the rest of his life, I was ripped apart. Immediately I was remorseful; I wanted so bad to show him I could be better now that I knew what was wrong. But I did not tell *him* this--instead, I'd been going to a mutual friend for support because I didn't know what else to do.

She tore me to pieces. She started out being nice to me, but that soon turned into making me feel like utter shit about myself. I already felt bad because I'd been such a bad girlfriend that I drove away the person I loved more than anything, but she made it so much worse. She told me I was abusive to him, that I'd manipulated him, that I'd conditioned him not to tell me what was wrong, and that the breakup was pretty much my fault. No matter how many times I tried to tell her I'd honestly had no idea what I was doing and that I wanted so badly to be better, she didn't care. She said it was possible to be abusive without knowing it, and that my ignorance was no excuse for how I'd treated him. Over the months following the breakup, I eventually found out that he's afraid of me and thinks I would actually go to where he is and physically assault him. He thinks I'll try to manipulate him back into the relationship. And *she* thought I was a threat to him.

That whole situation (mainly the breakup, but also her abusing me) was the worst emotional pain I've ever felt so far. Since December (the last time I talked to her), I've come to the conclusion that he's a spineless jerk who would rather run away and blame me for everything than realize we're *both* at fault because we didn't communicate well enough, and *she's* a goddamn SJW who blames me for the whole thing too and intentionally went out of her way to make me feel even shittier than I already did. I think their low opinion of me is just to make me the bad guy and make him feel less guilty. If it was all my fault, he didn't have to feel bad about dumping me. I don't know if they still practically hate me or not, and I have no desire to know right now. Maybe in a year or so. I find it ironic that she claimed I was abusive to him, when she spent every conversation we had abusing me when I went to her for support...and even when I knew she'd make me feel like shit, I still went back. It became less ""I need support because I'm hurt and confused"" and more ""I know you'll tell me how it really is and knock some sense into me."" I let her get to me. I let her get into my head. I actually kind of began to *believe* all the shit she said about me.

Even now it's become one of my demons. Sometimes I'll still wonder if I really am the abusive, manipulative bitch they seem to think I am. And that's why I eventually want to be friends or at least contact him again--not now, not even this year--but eventually I want to try to show him that I'm not the horrible person they both think I am, and I also don't want us to part on such shitty terms. I'd like us to be somewhat amicable, you know?

However, at least I learned my lesson--**communication.** Jesus, has the importance of that really been beaten into me after that fiasco.


Anyways, if you made it this far, thanks a lot for sticking through. I apologize for the wall of text, this turned out to be a much longer story than I was planning to tell--but I figured I should at least give you context, and then...I...got kind of carried away. I do have a tendency to ramble.

"d0go7lg","&gt;Also I have seen many men pretending to be alphas but they are insecure omegas on the inside, wearing the alpha mask to protect themselves, like a shield.

Analyzing sexual dynamics based on men pretending to be alpha seems ludicrous. Why don't you look at men who are actual ""alpha"" types (exhibit an abundance of alpha qualities authentically) and use them as an example? Why dismiss the concept using examples of men who aren't the kind of men the concept is referring to?

&gt;Men who like this whole PUA/RedPill culture tend to be selfish sexual partners. 

Lots of men are selfish (and lousy) sexual partners. Are some of them RP? Probably. But there are a whole shitload who are full on BP who are equally selfish and lousy. Believe me, I've actually had the opportunity to observe many, many different men in the bedroom, and the difference between selfish ""beta-types"" and selfish ""alpha-types"" is that selfish alpha-types are selfish but still manage to give the women they are with body-shaking orgasms. Beta-types who are selfish just leave women mildly disappointed or annoyed.

&gt;They are so entitled 

RP expressly dictates that you have to earn what you get. If by ""entitlement"" you mean ""has standards"", are you really going to go there?

&gt;they think their cockiness and showiness is everything a woman could wish

Mostly because being cocky/funny and the life of the party gets them laid like tile. I've been cocky/funny and the life of the party, and I have *not* been cocky/funny and the life of the party, and I can tell you that the impacts of those two different ways of being on my sex life were dramatic.

&gt;and they never wonder about what a real woman wants in bed. 

Yet women would keep coming back over and over again for more of the seksi time with me. Hmmm, it's almost as if I know how to satisfy them or something...hmmmm...

Even in my most disastrous relationships, the quality of the sex was never in question. They may have been frustrated by me as a boyfriend, but they all *loved* the sex. As a matter of fact, more than a couple complained that the relationship lasted longer than it should have because the sex was too good.

&gt;A relationship with them is solely based on sexual needs, but only THEIR sexual needs. 

Solely? Please. Now your projecting is getting way too obvious.

That's how *you* imagine all ""RP relationships"" working. Plenty of us can attest otherwise.

&gt;They don't care if their partners may not like blow jobs or anal. They will dump as many women as necessary until they find one who has sex like a porn star. 

Yes, men shouldn't have standards. /s

Should women similarly be shamed for dumping a series of men because those men can't sexually satisfy her? Or should she just find a ""nice man"" and settle down with him, even if he can't get the job done in bed?

&gt;They are masters at compartmentalization 

Of course they are. They are men. It has been widely observed forever that men compartmentalize sex more than women. I mean, that's like Sexuality 101 territory there.

&gt;and they suffer from the Madonna/Whore Complex as well.

I was 18 at the time, had been with my (then) girlfriend for 4 years, first love, kiss, hug, etc etc. We were madly in love with eachother and went through all the 'do you trust me' sort of crap you do at that age.

Seeing some family or something similar, far enough away for it to be a pain to get to, but not a million miles. It reads something along the lines of 'Were coming home, Im pretty ill', so I pester her a bit to find out whats going on and she opens out to me (over text, classy I know) that she's been self harming for  years and has really hurt herself and made her parents worry enough to bring her home.

Etc etc. Yes, stupid  thoughts, yes immature and selfish and yes, I said some things to her that were very dumb and, in a way, shamed her for opening up to me.

"cy98yv2","You know what the irony is? **I** actually **am** selfish and lazy. I'm only kind of selfish but I'm really, REALLY lazy.

And that's exactly why I work full time and I could never be a housewife!!

I'm soooo bad at self-motivating myself for recurring, menial tasks that are boring. I HATE doing housework. I am really just straight up lazy and I would rather be in bed eating junk food and surfing the net, that's the bald truth. If I don't have some kind of outside motivator that's what I gravitate to. 

Yes I have plenty of self-loathing and I would rather not be the way I am, and I tried for YEARS to be different but I'm just not. I would SO much rather be one of those people with tons of energy and a big work effort, and I don't know what it would take to make me one of them (some kind of crazy diet? Adderall?) But I have not figured it out yet and I don't think anyone else has either.

I DO have plenty of strengths as a worker, as well as my weaknesses (being lazy, no energy or motivation, etc.) That's why it's best for me to work full time because I can find a job that matches all of them!

I've had ALL kinds of jobs from legal secretary, to UPS package deliverer, to corporate marketing manager, to gym manager, to elderly caregiver, and so on. I've been really bad at some of them and had my self esteem go into the shitter. And I've been reeeeeaaaallly good at others. And sometimes it's hard to predict what it will be!!! I was AWFUL at being the legal secretary and gym manager, like really awful and got reprimanded all the time. I was excellent at being the corporate marketing manager, elderly caregiver, and, shockingly, the package deliverer!! If I had to go back to a more entry level type job setting I would go back to being the package deliverer in a heartbeat! They tried to promote me after 2 months!

Right now I have a professional job where I can be on reddit during the day as much as I want, which is exactly what I'm doing right now, and absolutely no-one is giving me shit for it! I get told all the time how great I am in this job.

One thing I know is that it would be a really bad idea for me to mix my professional and personal life; i.e., go to work for a friend of mine. There's just too large a chance that I will really suck at a given position if it doesn't match up well with my strengths and weaknesses, and that could end up really hurting the personal relationship. That's another reason why SAHM is not the job for me!

And, out of everyone here who is really righteous about working full time, I bet there's a significant proportion of them who do less than the OP too when you measure it all out.

You're not wrong, I think it's morally natural to feel the way you do (for good reason), and I'm sure that others in your family feel exactly the same way.  Just be cautious of others feelings in this time, grieve if you need to, and avoid pointing out the obvious.

EDIT:  After debating, decided to add my personal story below.

I had a friend die several years ago from taking his own life.  He had a wife and kids.  At the time, I found it very hard for me to feel sad or sorry for him, given (what I thought) was the situation.  Not only that, but I found it difficult for me to keep those feelings to myself, and I openly shared that I thought what he did was selfish and dumb.  It wasn't that I was 'wrong', it's just IN THAT MOMENT, everyone was already thinking it, and there was no need for me to be the one on the soapbox announcing it.

After the funeral, I learned that he was on medications for anti-depression and had quit cold turkey.  He never shared that with his friends (including me), and it explained a lot that I didn't realize at the time.  I'm still angry that he wouldn't talk about it, and I still feel it was selfish, but I also know I'll never fully understand what was going on internally.  And, just like you, others could have been injured as well, and I'm grateful that they were not.  If I could take back sharing my feelings at the time with people I have not seen since his death, I would.  Not because they weren't true, but because you never know the full story, and how those words may hurt others (that are already thinking it).

"cy2xfxb","I got a call from Nmom today. I initiated LC with my Nsis and decided to forego holiday gatherings if Nsis was there. Limiting. ""For a time."" Because I didn't want to go NC and come back for some reason and then be seen as incapable of going NC...I'll save NC if this doesn't work out. Nmom seemed surprisingly okay with my decision when I told her a few weeks ago. Nsis is pissed and trying to insight my anger.

Today though, Nmom must have actually realized that I would not be pressured into going to Christmas. And she was leaving Nsis's house... so she called. She minimized my concerns with Nsis ""So far that I know it's *only* two things"", told me how I was ungrateful for all Nsis has done for me and that I had a funny way of showing gratitude, told me I was selfish because this is Nsis's first Christmas without her MIL (passed in May) and it's hard for her and her family. That I was punishing everyone in our family, that I picked ""an interesting time,"" that I was making a big mistake, that I was burning bridges, that I ""never"" come to family holidays anyway so why she expected any different she didn't know, that she hopes Nsis never decides to treat me like this is she dies (in reference to her losing her MIL).  

And now that I've summed that all up...what was the conversation about here? HER trying to manipulate me (to feel bad) and ultimately to get what SHE wants--me seeing how wrong and selfish I am and going to Christmas. She doesn't give a sh*t about me, my concerns or what I think is best for my family.

It's been a hard time for me this year. I bought a house in February and...no one came to see it. Or help me move in (except my semi-Esis who sometimes is a FM). Shortly after we move in, I got pregnant, but lost the baby at 14 weeks. Like...had to pass an actual tiny baby that fit in my hand and ended up in the hospital due to hemorrhage/blood loss. Not one of my sisters was there for me. Not my mom... no one. I was alone as far as my family went. No one helped watch my kids or asked if I was okay... and I was definitely NOT okay. Nmom said ""what are we supposed to say?"" I was like ""I don't know? What do you say to anyone who lost someone?""

I unexpectedly got pregnant again, despite avoiding (like... sex only 2 times in 3 months avoiding) and this pregnancy has been riddled with anxiety and stress because of my loss... but again no support. No one asks how I am or what I am thinking or feeling. I've felt pretty alone... there isn't much ""benefit"" to my relationship with Nsis or Nmom. It's all about them... and I just get negative comments and judgement from them. Or defensiveness if I say *anything*  ""I read this interesting book about ____"" ""Oh well I wanted to do ___ but I just couldn't figure out how to make it work. Not everyone can do ___you know.""  I'm like...uh... the damn book wasn't about YOU and I was just sharing what I READ...you know like trying to have a CONVERSATION?! 

*sigh*  I just... I don't know. I get so much negative feedback from Nmom and Nsis... I feel like I am doing the wrong thing. Like I am being selfish.  But it helps for me to write stuff like this out. When I type out THEIR words, I see how poor their treatment really is of me... and that anyone would want that treatment to change or stop... and if it didn't stop, would cut off contact.

"cxw82w1","&gt;He was smart enough to see that he wouldn't foresee all kinds of technological change, so why should he bother making plans for the new society?

Circumstances are always changing, but human nature changes less quickly. As I understand it, Marx advocated imminent total revolution - does it really make sense for someone to advocate revolution while abdicating responsibility for what things should look like after the revolution? G.K. Chesterton said (I'm probably paraphrasing) that revolutionaries are always right about what is wrong, but wrong about what is right. Which to me is a *devastating* takedown of Marx - of course it's easy to point out flaws in the existing system, they're all around us. It's extremely hard to come up with something that would actually be better. And you're saying that Marx didn't even try to, while encouraging everyone to blow up the system.

"cxd7fjr","&gt;omega 3, that might explain how I made it to 25 years of age without any health problems and never consuming fish or other big omega 3 sources!

It is a puzzling thing, but the reality is that people seem to be able to easily live without it.

&gt;I think I would still rather supplement though, to be safe. The bread I tend to use has flax seed in it, do you think that's ""enough"" for ALA?

I looked it up. The [USDA](http://ndb.nal.usda.gov/ndb/foods/show/3716?fg=&amp;man=&amp;lfacet=&amp;count=&amp;max=&amp;sort=&amp;qlookup=&amp;offset=&amp;format=Full&amp;new=&amp;measureby=) says that flaxseed has 2.3 grams of ALA (they called it 18:3 in the report) per tablespoon. I seem to remember the recommended intake is ~1 gram a day (though if you want it to compensate for DHA and EPA you might want it higher). I'm not sure how much seed is in your bread, but it doesn't take much. One concern I would have with it being in bread is that it might not be stable at higher temperatures. So if the bread is baked with the seeds in it, it might inactivate the ALA.

&gt;To be honest, the only reason I've been doing all this pretty much all out of guilt.

That is pretty much my reason as well. It seems like a good reason.

&gt;I absolutely love eating meat, and the thought of never consuming it again is very scary (obviously not as scary as the animals' experiences being slaughtered, so I should try not to let that stop me).

I always use to love meat too. I know it can be a frightening prospect, but don't worry about it. Focus on learning knew, good vegan recipes and give it time. After about 6 months my cravings for meat left, which is normal. Now I tend to fantasize about my favorite vegan meals.

&gt;For some reason I recently started thinking about the suffering I've caused just from being alive on this planet and I started to feel like a truly evil, terrible person. In fact, everything feels ""tainted"" to me now, and I sometimes feel as though I deserve to die and that the sooner the human race is wiped-out, the better. I hate feeling like this, though... I like people, but now I'm scared that we're all just evil. 

We can be ignorant and selfish, but very few people actually enjoy hurting animals. Most people squirm at the sight of killing and butchering an animal. So I think a lot of people are hiding from the truth, but that doesn't make them evil. You might be surprised at the conversation you have if you live a peaceful vegan life. I make my ethics well known without ever getting pushy, and I'm always so happy when people become open minded about it. Set and example and show people that making this change isn't bad. Most people don't want to hurt animals, they just never knew any other way. Try not to feel too bad though. We live in a world that can sometimes be cruel, and no one can save the world. But every little counts and just changing your actions to align with your values can do a whole lot.

&gt;Sorry, I didn't mean to get so personal there. I've just been worrying about it lots.

I think it's good to get these thoughts out. Don't feel bad about sharing.

&gt;yeah I don't know if there's any suffering or cruelty involved in the production of honey. If not, great, I'll keep consuming it - I'm not fussed about the 'principle' of taking a product from bees. If yes, then dammit and I'll have to find something else.

I'd suggest looking it up. Some people that it is cruel. I've seen claims of them being intelligent (I disagree with that, as they have a very basic nervous system), they being harmed in the process of it (not sure on that one, but again, I don't feel much sympathy for bees), and it being wrong to exploit an animal, regardless of it's intelligence. The last one is actually one of the defining ideas of veganism, and it is a big sticking point for me. I suppose it makes me technically not a vegan, but I don't see anything wrong is using animal products so long as animals weren't harmed in the process.

"cx0hlnu","This I can definitely identify with. My father is a malignant narcissist and my mother (diagnosed by me) is histrionic, and also an enabler of my father's abuses. I could do nothing growing up without being yelled at or ridiculed. Even down to the way I walked and ate. I could expect to get punched, slapped, or whipped with leather belts for just looking at him wrong. I saw him manipulate, screw over, and gleefully hurt people just because he could. The man has no conscience and no moral code. I know this is why I am the way I am. My brain responded by dissociating, to the point I became numb to everything. I only saw the worst of people (both sides of my family are full of shit people) so I grew to hate everyone, I became extremely callous, and any empathy I should have developed was squashed. I am still extremely hyper vigilant around people, especially when I sense anger. I still expect people to go off the rails at any moment, for no reason at all. A couple things really helped me to deal with this and resolve my anxiety. One, just breathe. I know that sounds like trite bullshit but it grounds you. Focus on the actual act of breathing deeply. Notice your surroundings. Deep breathing calms you and allows you more control over your body. Two, think of the worst possible thing that could happen. The absolute worst, in gory, ugly detail, and how you're going to deal if that happens. Then recognize that is likely not going to happen. If it does, at least in my case, and someone decides they want to kick my ass, I already know what that feels like. Yeah, it's going to hurt like hell but that pain goes away. Third, expose yourself to it. Expose yourself to uncomfortable situations, force yourself to do it. You will live through it. You'll see it's not that bad. Then do it again. Your anxiety may never fully go away, but it will keep getting better. For me, a lot of it was control. I'm a control freak and I want to control every little thing I can about myself because I had so little control over my life in my childhood. Even my brain decided for itself how to deal with trauma. I will always be completely fucked up emotionally but I have accepted that. A big part of that was forcing myself into uncomfortable, anxiety inducing situations where I knew I would not like what was going on, and where I knew I would have no control over my anxiety. Eventually, I gained control over that. So it helped me two-fold- it got rid of my anxiety and helped me gain more control over my negative emotions. I'm still a control freak, and will always be. I am #1 and protecting myself is my main concern. I know that's selfish but I deserve it. I lived through hell growing up and it permanently screwed up my brain and for that I will always be selfish and egotistical but that's just how it is. Putting myself in uncomfortable situations with no fear also helped me to see how full of shit most people are when it comes to confrontation. 9 times out of 10 they will back down, especially when they see you have no fear in your eyes. It's easy to unnerve people with eye contact alone. Just think about how much anxiety you are causing them just with that. That easily puts you in control and you can get them to do what you want them to do. I'm rambling so I'll stop. But yeah, I get it. It sucks.

Second of all, yes, these threads are about me, if you'd read the post, it states it right there. It's my PERSONAL progress. I never said it wasn't about me, I never said in any of my posts that it wasn't about me. I guess if you took the time to read it, maybe you'd figure that part out. Never once was I arrogant in any way. I'm not saying my juices are the best, I'm not saying I'm going to change the E-Juice world. Also, I never said I was ""contributing"" to anything, or creating a tribe. Again...if you'd read, you'd understand that.


Third, I didn't disappear. I have replied to every single comment that has passed my threads. I decided it was a better idea to post about my overall progress instead of posting daily results. Yes, I post about feedback, but again...that is the whole point of this post. Are you that narrow minded that you have to be a complete dick in every comment you make towards me? ""I'm not trying to terrorize you or scare you away from DIY or anything dude."" To be honest, that is exactly what you're doing. Not only are you commenting negatively calling me arrogant and selfish, but you are also telling me that I am wrong for posting something like this. You think reddit isn't the place for something like this? You're sorely mistaken, friend. There are plenty of subreddits that I've encountered where people do just that. A lot of the gaming reddits, for example. League, people post their progress about going from Silver to Diamond/Challenger, their progress/runes/champs/matches/important details/etc. Hearthstone, I've seen several users posting about how they got to legend, their progress from start to finish, people posting about their first time getting to legend. Diablo 3, people grinding for gear, posting constant pictures of their progress through the different rifts. Reddit is EXACTLY the place for something like this. I can get feedback in a different way, instead of just posting something when I need help, I'm sharing my personal experience with product creation. Does that make me a guru in the vaping world? Of course not. It makes me a human interested in a community built around something I enjoy doing. I'm not turning this into my personal blog, I'm not using this community and then becoming a ghost for months. I have done a lot of work in the last week, and I'm planning on posting a big thread about it, instead of posting each individual result. Because of that, I'm a bad person? I'm wrong? I'm arrogant? Fuck off mate. Before you tell me you're not bashing me, you might want to re-read your comment, because that is exactly what you just did. Think I'm a dick or think I'm wrong?

"cwu3k1j","I was at a party with my friend in the winter when it was a little under 0°C outside. It was a party organised by our mutual friends year of his school to finance the big party at the end of their school time, so there was money involved, so there was a register. Fast forward a few hourse, we were drunk, I was inside dancing with a random girl and I wanted to take her outside for more, so we went outside and passed a big commotion of dudes yelling at and pushing one guy who was... MY FRIEND. I went over to see what everything was about and they accused him of grabbing inside the register to steal money. I highly doubted this but there were like 5 guys ready to punch him so I tried to deescalate and said we'll be on our way. They said I shouldn't go but he is not welcome anymore. So we leave the premises together, me still with this girl on my arm, and I tell him ""dude, I wanna go spend some time with this lady you're just gonna have to wait"" (I was supposed to sleep over at his house so we were gonna leave together). He was like ""yeah whatever, fine"". So I vanish for about an hour doing dirty stuff to this girl behind a nearby building while he waits outside the party on his own, while one other mutual friend occasionally brought him a beer outside.

"cwtg0ok","&gt; I don't know if you watched The Flash. That is a perfect example of a superhero friend that is endangered regardless of not knowing the secret. Iris is getting into the trouble because she's running after the Flash not knowing who he really is. The Flash believes it's safer for her not to know, but her interest in the Flash get her into trouble one time after another. 

It's like saying I'm not going to try and help someone who is badly bleeding because it is likely they will die anyway. Even if it is likely she gets in trouble without knowing who The Flash is, that doesn't mean Barry should make it more likely by revealing his secret. I've been meaning to watch The Flash but haven't had the time. (but I have time to type this out, weirdly, haha. I guess I'm just pushing the things I have to do later.)

&gt; The thing is whether it matters for the other person if they are lied to. If it does, then it doesn't matter if they found out or not, there was an act of lying and that's it.

You do say there are exceptions to this, but what do you base it off of? Absolute morality can't be arbitrary imo. There needs to be a set of rules.

I think the bigger problem, and what this all comes down to here is just how subjective morality is. I think there are forms of what I call ""objective subjective"" morality, basically, the objective part is, whichever decision is better for society, given the evidence we have available, is the moral decision. The subjective part is everyone may have different logic on what's better for society, and we have no way to objectify that, just like we can't say for sure what political ideology is best. Someone may believe killing a corrupt leader like Saddam Hussein is moral, but what if someone thinks Obama is corrupt? For him, he would not feel bad about killing Obama, he would not have a moral problem with it, just as the soldier who killed Bin Laden.

For this reason a subjective morality is pretty pointless. As long as you are doing what you think is best for society, I'm happy. Even that we won't do, because that's how humans are, but at least it's a code to live by. Even in the morality of The Church, which is a morality I do not agree with (obviously some is good), people ""sin"" all the time.

There are things we do all the time that doesn't better society, even worsens it. The car you drive is contributing to global warming which could eventually kill us all, and things like that. It can be thought of as selfish and greedy and immoral, but to society, it's no big deal. A lot of us don't even need cars, it just saves time generally. Also think about the [trolley problem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t85VvyT_M6U).

Most of us would save our family member over that of 2 or more strangers. I think it's objectively immoral and selfish, but we know we all will do it because of how our brain works.

To get back to the point, I think that because society will not be affected by me cutting the show, it is moral. It's more immoral if they find out because society has been affected, and probably only for the worse.

&gt; With such approach you can say it's fine to cheat as long as your partner won't find out. 

Well this stretches out my argument. It would be like saying because Bernie Sanders is for equality, he's a communist. It's more complicated than that.

For instance, there are more factors to consider, how much of a bad affect will it have on society? And how likely is this to occur? I consider both factors to be quite low. It is unlikely my parents will find out (based on many variables), and even if they do, it will not be a big deal, probably something to be laughed off. Of course, I could be wrong about the probability and what they will think about it (I've never asked them obviously, there are some things you can only know by experience), but that goes back to the subjectivity of morality. I believe these things (I believe society will only benefit from my actions), so in my mind they are moral, just like the soldier killing Bin Laden.

Back to your example, the cheating partner would have to consider how likely his action will affect society for the worse, and how much of an impact it will have on society. For a lot of people cheating is one of the worse things anyone can do, so it's not comparable to what I'm doing imo.

&gt; I probably wouldn't tell a five-year-old that he's dying (God forbids I ever had to decide on that).

I think this backs up my point. I assume you would tell an adult, so we have to ask ourselves why? What's the difference between a kid and an adult?

I thought about this for a bit. I think it all comes down to what I was talking about earlier. A child is innocent, he is less likely to know what is happening to him, and he is less likely to find out, or be able to help himself. I think it would *might* be reasonable to not tell an adult, at least understandable, but there are more factors involved. The pros are that the person can continue living life without this huge burden weighing down on them, this is the pro for not telling the kid as well. But the cons are more for an adult. For example, what if someone figures out / knows a way to heal themselves? If they have a lot of money they can put it into research, etc. Kids can't do that. Also they can better prepare for their death, making arrangements in their work, business, family, etc. Kids don't need to do that either. Also, like I said, a kid is less likely to know what is happening to them, or what medicine they are taking, and for why. It would be harder to secretly give an adult medicine, and they would more likely know something is wrong with them anyway. But the pro is the same regardless.

&gt; as far as I know every global high-street food manufacturer is obliged to show nutrition labels on everything. At least that how it works in Europe - you go to McDonalds, get your BigMac and there is a giant list of encrypted ""Es"" and other chemicals.

Not in America. =P They have the info on their websites, but generally not on the package. I think there have been some laws introduced to show sugar content on a menu or something, but I think it's just state law. McDonalds voluntarily does it here in America. I just went to Taco Bell and that don't have it on their packages, I think it's more like a regular restaurant in that manner.

&gt; They can speak with someone in the congregation what a fine series that Arrow is not being aware that it include supernatural things. What then?

They don't go to the meetings. If they did, your situation is certainly possible, but I believe still unlikely. Someone would have to talk about TV shows, ask what TV shows you watch, Arrow is not even their favorite show. My mom visits her ultra-JW and talks a lot about various things, and it has not come up even once. My aunt doesn't watch Arrow anyway. So yeah, someone would also have to know Arrow has supernatural things in it, so we are talking about a small chance within a smaller chance.

The conversation would probably go like this, anyway, ""We watch Arrow...."" 

""Arrow? I had to give that up when the supernatural things were introduced...."" 

""Supernatural? Like what?"" 

""When some guy was worshiping demons and offering a blood sacrifice to them or something."" 

""We haven't seen that."" 

""Oh? It was the latest season."" 

""Yeah, we didn't see it."" 

""Oh, well, I dunno then, maybe we are talking about a different show."" 

""Maybe. How is your son doing?"" =P

Worst I can see happening is both will be bewildered that they each saw different things and leave it at that. Extreme worst is they figure out they were watching the exact same thing except for supernatural elements, and then they will probably think Jehovah is shielding them from it. xD At that point it would be up to them whether to continue watching. No harm done.

People in my area are pretty chill and non-confrontational anyway.

&gt; But you can never prefigure what can happen and whether that affect the person. It possible that it would never happen and everything will be fine.

In the end, you're right, even if I think there is a 0.000001 percent chance of it happening, there's still that chance, and if I wanted to absolutely limit such a thing to happen, and them losing a friend or something (what kind of friend is that anyway? But I digress....), I would not do this.

But then again, I still ride in cars and there's a 0.000001 percent chance that I could single-handedly kill off the entire human race (or just a few polar bears) by doing that, so we aren't ever perfect. ;)",1447026838,"it can be thought of as selfish and greedy and immoral, but to society, it's no big deal.","selfish and greedy","selfish",NA,FALSE,"selfish and greedy","greedy",NA,NA,1

"cvkrni9","I don't ever post on this sub, but your situation is so ridiculously similar to something I went through that I wanted to share my story in hopes that it would help you.

My parents divorced when I was 9. Their relationship had always been extremely tumultuous, and even at that age I could understand why divorce was the only option. They were two people who loved each other very deeply, but that didn't stop them from being fundamentally incompatible. The screaming matches happened nearly every day, and even when things were quiet, they both always looked so... sad. So my father left.

He didn't go far, only moving ~10 miles away. Although I no longer saw him every day, he still tried to be part of my life. I know that he worked tooth and nail to make the child support payments, and he was always there when I needed him. He was far from the perfect parent (anger management issues, at times), but it was abundantly clear to anyone who knew him - including my mother - that he loved me. He always did his best to be there for me, even when I hit my teen years and started being rebellious. All in all, although he didn't live with us anymore, he was still definitively my father.

That changed when I was 15. He fell in love with a woman. He'd had girlfriends before, some of which I had met and most of which seemed like nice enough women, but this was different. Within 6 months, he announced that the two of them would be moving back to his home country (a small, third-ish world Slavic country) on the other side of the planet. I was... shaken up. My mother was livid, as it was pretty clear that the child support (that should have lasted for an additional 3 years) was not going to be a thing anymore. Additionally, for reasons, he would not be in a position to return to the states for over a decade. As a turd cherry on top of the shit sundae, I'd met the woman before and hated her pretty much instantly. This wasn't the standard ""new-lady-is-taking-my-daddy-away"" hatred - I legitimately believed she was a horrible human being. My father was leaving. Truly leaving, for a very long time. Worse, he was abandoning his responsibilities as my parent. And there was nothing to be done about it. The decision was made. Weeks of planning, yelling, crying, and begging went by, and then he was gone.

I didn't really speak with him for ~2 years. Like you, there was the standard exchange of birthday and holiday greetings, but it was all very cordial. Although at first he tried to keep up contact with me, the attempts ended pretty quickly as he got wrapped up in his new life. And then, ~2 years later, he contacted me and told me that his new wife was pregnant with my soon-to-be half-brother. 

He was over the moon. There was a spring in his... voice? that I hadn't heard in forever. Despite leaving the daughter he loved behind for a new life in a crappy country with a woman I thought was pure evil, he was well and truly happy. I didn't understand it one bit. I offered him frosty congratulations, wished him well, and ended the call.

I'll spare you the details of the soul-searching - you're going through it right now and I wouldn't be at all surprised if your thoughts are running the same courses mine did back then. But after a bit of time, I realized I didn't hate him. I didn't resent him. And, although a part of me really didn't want to, I forgave and supported him. I realized that my father had done what people everywhere do all the time - he chased his own happiness. It was irresponsible and selfish, but it wasn't anything billions of other humans hadn't done. He kind of screwed my mother on the money, but she recovered quickly enough and made it work with flying colors, as he had known 100% she would, as she was financially crafty and had a supportive boyfriend. He'd left me, yes, but in his mind he'd already done what he could to ""raise"" me - he had always been a strong believer that someone around 16 is enough of an adult that parental raising efforts should end and become more of guidance and advice (in other words, the sort of relationship that most full-fledged adults have with their parents). In his mind, he really wasn't doing anything terrible, and the ""minor"" issues were a price he was willing to pay for a chance at what he thought was true happiness.

Following that realization, my relationship with him slowly recovered. We still didn't talk very often (call rates were expensive, and he didn't have internet there yet for skype), but when we did, they were conversations that were warm and loving. He made it clear that I was always welcome to come to him for any help and advice, and he made good on that promise when, several years later, I went through an extremely painful breakup. He talked to me literally every day as I was battling depression over the heartbreak. He also made it clear that, should I ever want to visit, his home was open to me for as long as I wanted. He was there for me (at least in voice and spirit) when I truly needed him. We had our occasional fights like any family, and there was a period of 1 year where I didn't talk to him at all because of a blowup. But we recovered from that, too. He occasionally kept up friendly relations with my mother, as well- it took her much longer to get over his leaving, and I don't believe she ever truly forgave him. But they did ""hang out"" over skype sometimes. He ""met"" my current boyfriend over skype, as well, and then privately told me how much he liked him and that he thought I should hold onto this one - as long as he made me happy.

In November of last year, the evil bitch he married showed the true colors I had always seen in her, cheated on him, and left him, taking their TWO kids with her. He barely got one back. I was there for him as much as I could have been, and it was clear that my support meant the world to him. This past father's day, June 21, I had an awesome conversation with him. Things were going better for him, and he really enjoyed the call because, having lived in that country for so long, he'd forgotten that father's day was a thing. He was so happy and excited to get the call, as he wasn't expecting it. It was abundantly clear that the call from the daughter he still deeply loved made his entire week.

3 weeks later, on July 12th, I got a message from my cousin saying that my dad had been killed by a drunk driver.

OP, I can't begin to tell you how much it hurts to have lost him. I never really thought of him as ""still around,"" even, given that he had left, even though, after those initial 2 years, I got another ~6 years with him. And I don't want to tell you to forgive your father, because I fully understand that what he did was shitty. I understand because mine did the same thing. You may disagree with my forgiving him, and I don't blame you. His actions were absolutely selfish and irresponsible, and you are under NO obligation to him or anyone else to be ok with any of it. Whatever you feel towards him is 100% justified. But I promise you that - should you WANT to - it is fully possible to forgive him, if you can get inside his head and understand his choices. And although my story is no guarantee that your father feels the same way, it should, if nothing else, assure you that it is POSSIBLE to move on. To forgive him, to give him a chance to prove he still cares about you, and to move forward with your relationship - whatever form it may take - for as long as you have the chance.

"cve7l4i","I don't think it's entirely misogyny in this case, though I would agree that female characters trends to get judged more harshly for actions and personality traits that male characters would get away with (or be lauded for).

I would also put a lot of the Freddie hate down to the fact that she is so much in opposition to Will, who is presented throughout most of the series as the person we're supposed to be rooting for. So even though Freddie has perfectly legitimate reasons not to trust him, and is mostly just doing her job (even if not exactly ethically) the fact that she doesn't like Will makes it easy for the audience to dislike *her*.

Contrast with Chilton, who is similarly unethical and selfish, but because he is typically presented as comic relief, the audience doesn't see him as a legitimate threat to Will or Hannibal, unlike Freddie who actually had the ability to damage Will's reputation and relationship with Abigail.

"cv1uygi","&gt; Using the beating of slaves as symbolism reinforces that there is something right about beating slaves, because it is directly being related to God's justice and righteous punishments. The parable works because it is relating the righteousness of beating slaves when they deserve it to God punishing humans when they deserve it.

Finally, we get to your actual argument.  Random rewritings of the parable in ways that would make you happy, or lists of other comparisons that don't bother you did not get to the actual point.  This does.  

You are stretching the analogy too far.  The parable is not about justifications for punishments.  It's about watchfulness, and responsibility, and doing the right thing.  It mentions both rewards and punishments, but does not mention justifications for either.  

Finally, and this is important, you can't put words in people's mouths like this.  I don't believe this interpretation.  I strongly doubt Lewis would believe it either.  I'm not even sure that if you looked hard for a record of any Christian believing this, that you could find anything.  

&gt; That entire connection is something you're trying to swipe away with ""it was only a reference to slavery, not an endorsement"".

That is an inaccurate summary of my arguments.  I did make that argument, but I also made the argument that you're taking an illustrative story too literally, including a reference to a mother chicken metaphor, asking whether you thought that meant God was a chicken.  I also made a rather lengthy argument that you had missed an earlier and relevant part of the parable, showing that the person being punished was not only irresponsible and selfish, but was actively harming others, and that in fact he was beating slaves.  I later asked if you had even read that argument, and I received no response either time.  I made an argument about an analogy with a duel in it, and in related paragraphs asked numerous clarifying questions, since the point of your argument was not clear.  

&gt; You've performed a similar dodge with the call to murder ""homosexual temple prostitutes"". All you said was you don't agree with it, then you try to move on as if that was a sufficient response.

Did you forget that you've dodged many of my arguments, sometimes repeatedly?  Or that when you brought this up you did it in a personal attack on me?  I did not get into it then, because I wanted to make sure you'd read my response to how you'd brought it up.  

Essentially, I don't have a particularly literalist view of inspiration.  I don't think that being inspired is like God using you as a typewriter.  I don't think that inspiration is uniformly spread through the Bible, and obviously certain passages about how many cups and plates and donkeys the Levites had are less valuable than others.  I don't think laws written for the ancient Israelites were meant to be timeless or flawless.  I do think the ancient Jewish laws were pretty good for their time.  I also think there is no Christian obligation to follow the Jewish laws.  

So when you talk about an ancient law like that, I am not likely to think it's an accurate reflection of God, but of the culture of ancient Israel.  

&gt;  I've been providing long lists of detailed examples and you keep deflecting them by saying, ""You know, there are other interpretations out there.""

The only thing I can remember that was a list was the stuff about other parables you would have liked better, and the stuff about analogies in parables you wouldn't object to.  In both cases, you weren't saying what was actually wrong, just giving examples of something you didn't dislike.  

And, really, ""there are other interpretations"" *is a solid counterargument* to many of the arguments you have brought up.  You assume something about an interpretation being the only one available, then attack based on that, and you do this a lot.  If my interpretation is not what you assumed, what do you expect me to do?  Say I believe something I don't?

"cv13b0s","&gt; It's not just jaded, it lacks a connection to humanity.

Actually I think it's more in tune with humanity - not to think of people as ""evil"", but to understand at our basic nature we are essentially selfish.

If we weren't selfish, we wouldn't last long as a species. Babies and young children cry because they are hungry, cold, hurt, afraid - this is purely selfish but essential for survival, to alert the parent-figure that something is wrong.

As a child grows and increases awareness of the world around, a whole part of the the parent-figure's responsibility is to gently nudge and push the child out of selfish behaviour. We are supposed to encourage our children to share toys, not to hit other kids, eat healthy... in general put themselves and some of their wants second. Our whole process of growing from a baby to an adult is a journey from being the most important thing in the universe to realisation and acceptance that we are only a small part of it.

Unfortunately, parenting is not exactly a skill that is taught, and doesn't require much skill to join the club - therefore the level to which the selfishness is trained and disciplined out of us varies from person to person, family to family. That's not to mention selfish adults who accidentally or intentionally do the opposite for children.

At a basic level, all people need to lose some childish selfishness in order to function in a society that aspires to, if not always achieves, cooperativeness and all the other good things that come from getting on with each other.

However you will see it all around, people acting in their own self-interests, every day - from arguing over a parking spot to stock market bubbles. It's not evil because often people's actions are not so much intentional to inure or upset others, rather it's is actions that are done without care or thought to others - actions to promote or protect self.... and of course, who hasn't celebrated when a political or personal rival falls on hard luck?

Hence...

&gt; Most humans wish to be good

Most humans prefer to *think* of themselves as good and wish to be thought of as such, and whilst we're not evil, I don't think we're all that good either. Because a good (selfless) society would not need so many police, laws and courts to settle disputes and keep the peace. Most people mistake 'not doing evil' with 'being good', but I think it's perfectly possible for someone to 'not be evil' and yet be very selfish, putting themselves above others to the detriment of others.

Even those who commit some of the most atrocious crimes will find ways to either excuse their actions, or dissociate themselves from it. Even hardened criminals can often be 'good' to their friends and families (even justifying their heinous acts for the 'good' of those people).

I'd say that it's not ultimately about showing loving kindness to the cruelest. That is definitely included.

The shitty things that people do are because of their afflictions. These afflictions are considered to be adventitious to a person's true nature. The afflictions are not inherent to the person.

"ctmt25s","&gt;If you do not oppose that practice, then you have no right to complain about what follows. You don’t get to blame it on race, you don’t get to blame it on guns, you don’t get to blame it on anything other than your endorsement of exactly this type of situation. You cannot simply demand that a violent organization come into existence, run around threatening people with violence for your peace of mind, and then call for a public execution when they do exactly what you asked of them.

If you abolished police, which I have no real opposition to, you still have to replace them with some type of security. And I know that police hardly represent a security force is many instances, they mostly react, they show up after crimes have been committed. I get that. 

The main problem is that property owners have so little control over their property. Business owners can't freely discriminate, home owners are paying for police service, much like people pay for public schools, so there are reduced incentives for people to turn to private entities to take care of security and education. 

Most libertarians and people in general don't have the time to fight against the state. Not unless they are people like Chris Cantwell, people that collect donations and run websites that bring in advertising revenue that enables them to be activists. The average libertarians, in fact, almost all libertarians are going to support the police once the shit starts to hit the fan. 

I get that you want to be pissed at people for doing this, but it's really human nature. You won't see me complaining when rioters are trying to loot businesses and the police come in to crack some skulls. The reality is, police often fail private businesses in this regard, they once again show up after the chaos has begun. 

I don't need to oppose police for moral reasons. I oppose the current system for economic reasons. I understand that my morals aka my personal preferences will have little impact on the system today, because there will always be people on the opposite side that disagree. 

This is where libertarians come in and say ""yeah, well people are dumb, people are ignorant, we need to educate them and change their minds!""  But do people really think this is the solution? Had anyone ever stopped and thought that maybe the majority of the population is incapable of such complex thought? That most people follow the path of least resistance and that the only way you can change their mind is by controlling them and making them become complacent? 

People like to bring up the past and point out that people were more independent, personally responsible, they were hard workers, they didn't complain, government corrupted them into being lazy and selfish. But did you ever stop and think that maybe capitalism just made it easier for them to be lazy and ignorant? That it's relative. That most people even several hundred years ago would have been susceptible these weaknesses? It's just that they never had the luxury to? They spent most of their time just working to survive, they didn't know how to read, they didn't look beyond or even understand the world outside their farms and communities. 

If you want to stop police abuse, it's not going to be as easy as simply getting rid of police. No more than you can expect to get rid of drug abuse by eliminating drugs. Remove police and some type of security will be necessary. And I suspect that the average person, in just a very short period of time will revert back to their old ways. And a system of corrupt police.. or security.. or whatever you want to call it will emerge once again. You can't simply eliminate the initiation of force and expect things to change. This is where the NRx people have something to contribute to this discussion. Ancaps and their brand of egalitarianism seriously underestimate the weaknesses inherent in most people. Privatizing everything to the point where they can claim force isn't being initiated is a lazy position in my opinion.

Yes I know that she was not into me, she did it excluvely for the money, she probably was disgusted by me and I am pathetic for doing it. At this point of my life, I accepted the fact that I am a pathetic human being and my life is abnormal.

That might sound selfish but I don't mind paying for an escort because this simulation is the closest I would ever get to a normal sexual life. It is not as satisfying as a real relationship but it brings a bit of joy in my miserable life, so why should I feel bad for simulating a basic human need that can easily be fulfilled by everyone else. Why should I feel sad and stay still on my romantical void? Why can't I at least try to mimic what humans need most, affection?

The escort is probably repulsed by my mere presence but she acts like not and it helps me a lot to at least simulate what affection looks like. That's selfish and pathetic to take advantage of her with money but at this point of my life I simply don't care anymore. This is the only thing I can look forward to in my life with excitement and that prevents me from falling apart.

"ctak75r","How old are you?

You're right that what you're saying sounds selfish, but it also sounds incredibly immature. I keep imagining you as a teenager or in your very early twenties.

Of course your wife would miss you if you died, and then she would move on and marry someone else and hopefully find happiness with them. And none of that would matter to you, because you would be dead. None of that would mean you were forgotten either. You would still be her first (I'm assuming) husband and the father of the children you share. 

Nor would she remember you MORE if you forced her in some way (like this religious issue is forcing OP) to live the rest of her life alone if you died tomorrow. She would likely grow to resent and dislike you for forcing her to live alone and without a partner because you are so selfish and immature that you couldn't just be happy with the time the two of you were together when you were alive and never made her promise to live *forever alone* so you could be happy in death that she would have to be alone mourning you forever. I mean really, who's THAT selfish?

I've been married for a long time now and if I died tomorrow, I hope my husband would mourn a reasonable period of time and then would go on to find happiness with someone new. Because I want HIM to be happy. I'm not worried about him thinking of me forever after I'm dead more than I'm worried about him having a happy life. It's pretty weird and controlling to feel the need to force your partner to promise never to marry again just so they can ""keep your memory alive."" As though your memory isn't strong enough on it's own and the only way they will remember is if someone is a martyr to your cause.

Yes, we could say our default position is inner and selfish - but it appears hardwired for most of us to derive great joy in community, good will, and all that fuzzy stuff. If I were a psychopath/sociopath or of a different species, maybe I wouldn't be wired to enjoy outward compassion. Can't say. What I can say is it's no picnic to be selfish. I find that the most unpleasant times in my life coincided with selfish mindstates - these mindstates never seem to be satisfied, regardless of the input.

Conversely, the happiest times in my life came when I was GIVING love, kindness, appreciation - note I did not say receiving, the giving itself was a very pleasurable state. But I'm rambling.

Point is, life will suck at times. But illusions of permanancy and ""selfing"" - ""I deserve this"", ""he chose to do this to ME"", ""I should be treated in such and such way"" - causes a bunch of unnecessary pain/suffering in addition to the initial trauma.

Most of life gives the system neutral inputs, some good, some bad. From a certain point of view all inputs are neutral. Problem is system hangs on to a great many of those inputs, makes them a bigger deal than they are, creates an unpleasant output, then takes that as new input. Allow the system to optimize itself so it processes the inputs quickly and spends as much time as possible bathed in ease, love, and gratitude. These things make for a very pleasant system.

"csyc5o3","The reason it's good for you to save money as an individual is because you may need the safety net and because one day you may like to keep existing without working for an income. Saving, for an individual, is selfish but necessary. 

But for an economy, everyone saving money is a bad deal, because borrowing makes growth. If I make you wait to open a pizza shop until you have the cash saved to finance it completely, you may never get to open it, and if you do, you'll probably be old and not run it for very long. You may even choose not to do it because keeping your stash is safer. But if I let you borrow money from me to do it, then I can charge you interest. And *you* can make even *more* money selling pizzas than the interest I charge you. And we both make money. Your shop may flop, but that's the bet. You're somewhat insulated by being able to default, and I'm somewhat insulated by charging you interest and making lots of other loans (bets).  Of course, if I don't think you'll pay me back, I might charge you more interest or not offer the loan. 

If you're a country, you don't want money hoarded. You want it out in the economy being lent out to people who use it to create more value, like by starting businesses or buying, maintaining , and improving homes. 

These bets, over time and on average, have always worked out for the better. It's how the whole economy basically works. If you sum up all the people in a country's assets and subtract all the debts, you may be surprised to learn that the total is negative. We owe more than we have. And that's because we bet that, in the future, there will be more value because there will be more people and they will be more productive through innovation and technology. 

So, if I'm Greece, I want to bet on my economy's growth and be able to spend at a deficit, but that only works if I make good bets. If I'm Germany, I want to bet on Greece's economy too, but I've been burned recently, and it's more important to me to ensure that my citizens are paid back.

The point is that it's what happens when you let authoritarianism eat itself, spin out of control and concentrate power in the military-industrial-complex and then allow that network to gain incrementally more access and elevate their own cultural roles, as if they are hacking culture itself.

"crleir6","Hmmm...I see. You do make some good points but I might as well offer my rebuttal.

1. This is almost the same as saying that Rin is just a generic-tsundere archetype. The characters are multifaceted and there are reasons for them being the way they are, including Sakura. Just as Rin’s tsundere attitude branches from her struggle of balancing her personas as a normal girl and a cold, veneering magus, Sakura’s “shy, moe personality” branches from the oppressive atmosphere she’s been raised in; she’s been trained to be obedient. Shinji beats and rapes her constantly and Zouken is cultivating her as the perfect holy grail by making her life absolutely terrible; she’s had no room to develop a real personality other than the one she currently has as she spent more time with Shirou. 

2. She does try hard to make you feel bad for her, but this is honestly another facet of her character; she expresses so much self-pity, but the amount of times she reprimands herself for that very pity and acknowledges her own weakness showcases an incredible amount of self-awareness and maturity. When she does things like warn everybody to leave Fuyuki before the mud inevitably swallows her and the city or when she does something like order Rider to protect Shirou from her at all costs because she can already feel that she’s a hair’s breadth away from mentally breaking, it’s because she acknowledges the fact that she’s weak and that the pain she feels from the circumstances will lead her to do horrible things. She’s a scared, young girl who doesn’t know what the hell to do except play by Zouken’s hand, and she doesn’t try to hide the fact.

3. Sakura sees herself as a broken girl with nothing to show for herself, while sees Rin as Ms. Perfect who can use magic with a proficiency that she never thought she could achieve; it’s pretty obvious why she’d be jealous of her. And after being possessed by Angra Mainyu, to be honest, breaking his legs seems very light in comparison to what else she could be thinking. She's literally possessed by ‘All the Evils of this World,’ and this influence from Angra, along with the influence of the treatment she received, exponentially shows itself as the route progresses. [Hollow Ataraxia Angra Mainyu Spoilers](/v ""When Shirou was possessed by Angra, he said things like how he'd have normally raped and killed Bazzett by now if he was his usual self. Heck, he even has sex with Caren, even though the influence of Angra Mainyu threatens to rip her apart from the inside out. Those messed up actions and thoughts practically come with the title."")   I'm not saying that her thinking such thoughts is a good thing, but this is the magical Nasuverse. A lot of the circumstances that surround our characters are ones that don’t have solutions that come from singular, societally-correct means.

4. Zouken has been raising Sakura as his Magnum Opus for 11 years straight, it makes sense why she'd end up shaking the plot so violently. Heck, there's a whole excerpt of Zouken explaining how impressed he is with Sakura's growth as the Black Holy Grail and how much he loves her, in his own messed up way. And she’s already told her herself that she doesn’t deserve someone as great as Shirou, that’s why she backs off so quickly in the other routes. It’s the fact that she finally has a chance to be with him that tips her over the edge. And the logic that backs up Shirou protecting her so vehemently now is that, while he takes it to the point of extreme nihilism, he’s finally valuing those he loves over the ideal he’s trying to pursue. This is literally the most human that he has been in any route; even though Sakura threatens to cause the world to crumble along with herself, he refuses to kill her for the sake of the common good because the common good pales in comparison to what he thinks could make Sakura, the person he loves, happy. This is almost the same sentiment that compels Rin to drop her knife and embrace Sakura, even though her existence threatens to eliminate all of humanity; she’s no longer seeing things through the mindset of the magus overseer of Fuyuki, but as a big sister who’s biggest regret is that she couldn’t save her little sister in her time of need.

TL;DR She may act weak and selfish, but given her circumstances, she tries her damned hardest to put up a fight worthy of writing walls of text about.

"cr9t6vq","What most seem to be missing here is that D&amp;D is **your** game. The reason I've been playing it for the last 30+ years is its versatility. I've played high fantasy campaigns that were dark and grim, full of adult content. I've played silly campaigns where the PCs all had special attacks based on their outrageous anatomy (Bola Balls was my favorite). There is no wrong way to play D&amp;D unless you violate the #1 rule: **have fun**. Other than that, do with it what you will.

That said, there are several ways to mold the game to your players. If they want to run a crusade where they fight (non-lethally) against all that's evil, that's fine. If they just want to be a group of pacifists trying to make sense of the violent world around them, that's fine, too. I know this is going to sound like blasphemy to most D&amp;D players, but **you can actually play a game of D&amp;D that never involves a single combat roll** and still be fun. Play a campaign that emphasizes role-playing and skill checks over combat. This is a great opportunity to give the different cultures of D&amp;D nuance. Maybe in your world, orcs are brutish and selfish, but they don't automatically try to kill everyone they meet. Even published adventures can play out very differently, depending on how the players decide to act around the denizens of the D&amp;D universe. Imagine playing Tyranny of Dragons where the party is trying to battle the dragon cult on a philosophical level--trying to win hearts and minds instead of running hearts through with steel. There are some great opportunities here for a really fun game that doesn't make anyone feel uncomfortable or left out.

Ultimately, you have to use your own judgement about how much real-life religion you bring into the game. If you can do it in a way that's inoffensive for the players and it sounds fun to them, do it. If they're not really comfortable with it, don't. Some people are fine calling divine magic ""prayers"" and considering some magical items ""holy relics"", but others aren't. Some would love playing in an Old Testament setting (there are several biblical stories that would make great adventure hooks, by the way), but some would feel uncomfortable with that. Above all, **have fun**.

"cqrxwb3","You are not alone, and it's not your fault you are feeling depressed. You are very, very young. I know that sounds patronizing, but your life isn't over, you're not a terrible, incorrigible human being. Your problems are not trivial. Just because some people have it worse doesn't mean that your struggles and hurts aren't real and important and hard.

Most of the more intellectual stuff you've said in this post is oversimplifying, everyone has a certain degree of narcissism and other traits. People might be inherently selfish, but pro social (altruistic) behaviour is why we're nice to people, it's in human nature to get along and care about others. It helped us survive. It's not a delusion about not wanting to seem selfish.

You were bullied, that's really rough. That enough is reason to have depressed feelings. Bullying, especially at such a young age, is horrible. It has disastrous effects on your mental health.

As for death and living forever, you don't understand it now, but life isn't about living as long as possible, it's about living well. Most people would rather live to 60 and live fulfilling lives surrounded by people they love instead of living to 90 and being alone/bitter. Try not to dwell on death, if you can.

Therapy will help you loads. Therapy helped me so much, I had a lot of similar problems as you, I was bullied in grades 7 onward, and went through a lot of trauma. Therapy will teach you to manage and cope with these feelings, and help you acknowledge that you've been through a lot, and that is inevitably going to affect you.

You might not find the right therapist right off the bat, it might take a few tries to find a good match, but trust me, it's so so worth it. Give it some time, too. It took me 1-2 years to feel significant change in my mental health, but I was taking small steps for a long time. I'm 20, and I wish I started therapy at your age, it would have helped me move along my life so much better.

Take care of your body. Exercise 3-7 times a week, get enough sleep, eat healthy, take some vitamins (I like omega 3 and vitamin D) This won't cure you, but it will make your life easier. Spend time with people you like and care about, and work on your own goals.

"cqf43fh","Great episode, loved everything. I liked the old OP, even so the new one is welcomed as an improvement.

At last we're seeing the strain Hachiman's choices are putting on himself and the relationships in the Service Club. The way he dealt with the problems the other brought didn't really solve them, but just destroyed the problem by sacrificing other things that were important too. Recalling now, they only really solved Totsuka and Zaimokuza problems by allowing both of them to keep following their objectives, all the other cases had mixed or outright negative results on most of the people involved, and in both these cases it wasn't Hachiman alone solving the issue, but a joint effort by all club members, but primarily Yukino taking the lead.

With this evident, in this episode both Hiratsuka and Yukino put his believes in check with their questions; will Hachiman be able to save the ones he really want to save if he keeps using the same methods? Why did he go so far as hurting himself and others' feelings to keep appearances in Hayama's group or Sagami's reputation if he, himself, said that superficial appearances are meaningless? Doesn't this makes what he did really pointless? Hachiman is just another liar, the biggest liar. The shock he took from this is a big turning point in the series and will probably play a big role in the next few episodes. Poor Yukino, she is truly lonely in her righteousness.

Urgh, both Haruno and Orimoto in the same place. Orimoto wasn't only the one who rejected him in middle school, but the one who spread it to his classmates since he did it while no one else was watching, Hachiman's reputation in middle school and his hardcore loner tendencies got even worse because of this bitch. Haruno also doesn't help by rubbing salt to everyone wounds, maybe she is helping by doing this, but like Hachiman way of doing things, it's also messed. Like Hayama said, she is probably just toying with the things she like until they break, maybe in hope they these people will pick themselves up for the better? Not sure.

I have just finished volume 8 but I'm still not sure of what to think about Isshiki. She is cute. Annoying and selfish, but cute. Her voice fits the character perfectly. Even after she being unreasonable the whole time and being a fake, I cannot bring myself to hate her like I do with Haruno since she isn't really hurting others directly or intentionally, she made her request, the Service Club agreed on helping but it's not like they have to take all the requests presented, it was their choice so it's hard to blame Isshiki, even because she was forced into that position by others (because of her behavior... but...)

Komachi is still cute, even when angry. Poor Hachiman, hated even by his sister now!

This is where the series apparently got really serious, I don't remember if I saw anything really funny this episode or in the whole volume 8 at all, I don't think the art and atmosphere from the first season would've worked well with these last episodes. This time Studio Feel did a job even better than the first two episodes, gladlly they didn't really skip any important part at all from the novels, only minor stuff that could've been put aside without any impact.

"cq9jp9u","First, thank you for listening and offering your support.  I really appreciate the validation that I was put in a bad situation.

The issue, I think, is that she is so self-focused that her attention was on her own wants.  Everything else, including what was going on with me, was not in her field of vision.  I will say that I think she lacks empathy and cultivates grudges like a prize rosebush. 

About a year and a half ago, the intake manifold on her truck started to leak antifreeze.  I put in a new manifold gasket.  Pretty big job.  Her door panel was catching on the frame and kept coming loose.  I tried fixing it, but it kept catching to her dismay.  A few months later, the water pump went out.  Her antilock brakes kept locking up.  She was frustrated with the truck.  I think her frustration overcame her ability to see how hard it was for me to prioritize and fix the issues.  The oil leak became more pronounced after a month or so.  It was the manifold gasket and I had accidentally smooshed out the gasket glue from the back of the engine.  While at school, she asked for money to go get it fixed because she was so annoyed with the problem.  I told her no, it would be too expensive and that I would fix it when she brought it home.  This set up an expectation in her mind.

While I was in the hospital, her boyfriend's father, who is a mechanic, looked at it and said it was an oil hose under the engine.  He had her buy the hose and when I got discharged, he offered to put it on.  Great guy.  I said I could still do it.  When I got the truck home, I followed the leak and it was indeed from the intake manifold.  The hose would have been useless.  She's angry on the other issue that if I had just let her boyfriend's father work on it, it would be fixed.  However, I know it wouldn't have been fixed and neither would the other issues.  I tried to explain that, but she thinks I'm wrong and trusts her boyfriend's father's assessment.

She has blamed me for months for not working on the truck when I had time and it was available, but the oil leak was less important than the other things I had to fix.  Plus the intake is such a big job to just keep a few drips from forming, which she fails to grasp.  She would never help working on the truck before and when she did, she would complain and feign uselessness.  Very selfish, but it got her out of the dirty work.

I told her last week that I will work on it when she gets home in the summer, but she will have to help me.  She agreed to it.  I figure that will give her an idea of how big of a job it was.

As a side note, when my older daughter told me about how angry the younger one was and how she was threatening to be through with me, I didn't feel angry.  I just stared off and then cried.  My older one told me not to take it personally because my younger one is just so self centered.  I struggled for a day or two on 'How could she act that way after I pushed myself to try to help?'.

"cpra3mu","&gt; the big players divide it up and form monopolies. To create a free market requires government.

Monopolies are only able to exist when protected by government. Name one monopoly that existed without the help of government either regulating chances of new competition, giving the monopoly tax loopholes so they could always have lower prices than possible competition. 

&gt; To create a free market requires government.
Libertarianism argues that smaller government is required to increase market freedom. Don't you see? It's self-contradicting nonsense!

Yes, smaller government means more market freedom, and if your statement that free market requires government is correct, which I disagree, you are saying *no* government creates monopolies, so we must have a *big* government, no in between. *Smaller* government allows competition and prevents companies from buying government and using it to stop competition. If companies buying the government is a problem, which it is, bigger government just allows companies to have more power over competition. 

&gt; Labor unions are how the small folk band together to counter the power of the big players in the economy.

Too bad they prevent people from working by setting price floors for labor and then companies are less likely to hire more, especially when it's such a pain in the ace to fire someone, no matter what they did, so no, economically libertarian is believing in the free market to set wages based on how much a worker is worth to the company and having enough demand to increase wages. According to democrat ~Clinton's Secretary of Treasury nonetheless~ economist ~former president of Havard~ Lawrence Summers, 

&gt; “[A] cause of long-term unemployment is unionization. High union wages that exceed the competitive market rate are likely to cause job losses in the unionized sector of the economy. Also, those who lose high-wage union jobs are often reluctant to accept alternative low-wage employment. Between 1970 and 1985, for example, a state with a 20 percent unionization rate, approximately the average for the fifty states and the District of Columbia, experienced an unemployment rate that was 1.2 percentage points higher than that of a hypothetical state that had no unions. To put this in perspective, 1.2 percentage points is about 60 percent of the increase in normal unemployment between 1970 and 1985.”

Economist Richard Vedder did [a study] (http://www.researchgate.net/publication/24096289_The_Economic_Effects_of_Labor_Unions_Revisited) that showed Unions have cost the US economy $50 trillion (in 1994 $) from 1949-2000. 

&gt; Libertarians should support labor unions, or should support busting monopolies

They do support busting monopolies, labor unions monopolies included, through competition and not having the government protecting the monopoly.

yea, no, that's part of the problem now, people don't play nice and are willing to expand government to protect their wealth and monopoly.

"cp3dwpn","Well, this is an intricate one, but I will try my best to give unbiased advice while also presenting new viewpoints as a man in a long-term, stable, open relationship with my girlfriend, let's call her ""C"". Some background: C and I were in a typical closed relationship until about a year and a half in. Up to that point, I knew and understood C's bisexuality and we had a deal in place that she could have a 'permanent hall pass', but only with other women since she could either satisfy her needs for men through me, or if not that it was a sign she might be better served with another man. She had cheated on me one night with her ex-boyfriend (whom she admitted she hated for cheating on her, but that she was accepting she needed to solver her feelings for him instead of ignoring them), but after my initial hurt and feelings of betrayal were solved, we were once again stable and very much in love. No further affair has happened since, so I think I made the right choice.

Fast forward a year and a half and she, out of the blue, asks me how I feel about our arrangement. Seeing as it had only materialized into one night with a girl friend and another night where we both too part in a threesome with another girl friend of ours, I was quite happy with the status of things. I am confident in my sexuality, rarely feel threatened with regards to C and other men, and it had also worked once already in my benefit. So after some talking, we decide to try being fully open because she felt (unbeknownst to be) guilty for having more freedom than I did. I of course said I had no desire to sleep with other women, but since have and our relationship grows stronger each day, and not in spite of our openness.

However, just like any relationship, there are rules and she could still cheat on me if she wanted (basically by sleeping with someone without informing me ASAP [we shoot for 'before' but obviously the heat of the moment sometimes precludes that]), and I live every day knowing there's a chance she'll sleep with another man. That being said, if she is flirting with another man, I remember that even if she wants to or does in the future have something physical with him, that it is indeed just a physical act of sex and by no means an act of lovemaking. Lovemaking is something we share only with each other.

Now that you have the background (sorry if TL;DR, the gist is that my girlfriend and I are in an open relationship so I experience her flirting and going home with other men on occasion), some things I notice here:

1. Your wife doesn't seem to care much about **you** or your feelings, or at least as much as you care about her. I'm not trying to be mean or saying that can't change, it very much fluctuates over time, but that seems to be the case. The fact that she refuses your requests to stop being so flirty but then **also** refuses your requests to be present when it happens for your own piece of mind is not only extremely selfish, but suspicious. If she truly has nothing to hide, why is she hiding her goings-on from you, especially when those goings-on are something you're uncomfortable with?
2. Her justification that she doesn't want you to be beaten up furthers the suspicion. The fact that she could see a situation where another guy would get so upset that her husband is there with her to see her flirting with said guy to the point that he would beat you up is concerning because it hints that she is, when you're not aware, leading some of these men on that something will or could happen. Why else would a (sane) man, even a shitty one, who knows she is married to the man standing next to her, be upset to the point of fisticuffs with her husband because John Doe wants to flirt with the wife? Moreover, if she cares more about you than these guys, why wouldn't she at least try to stand up for you if that happened? If these men she flirts with are indeed the 'men's men' she claims, they **would not** do that, or at least if she intervened, which is HER job here, not yours, a man's man would not lay a finger on her in protest.
3. The fact that she has created her own rules for this kinda seals the deal for me. If she has rules for this interaction she has with other men, that means at one point she almost certainly felt guilty or wrong about it and created the rules as a way to justify the actions she knows are wrong, but does not wish to stop. The whole reason C and I have rules about our openness is that without staying in those rules, we're still cheating which is **never** okay in a relationship. Also, even I believe that sex is not the only thing which constitutes cheating, infidelity doesn't even need to be physical.

I'm far from saying your relationship is unsalvageable, but it needs a lot of work (the bulk of which from her side) and **soon**. She craves not just attention, but specific and sexually charged attention, from men other than her husband. Her husband has tried to be understanding, but is uncomfortable with this commonly socially unacceptable behavior from his wife towards other men, and has clearly expressed those feelings. At this point, she either needs to be willing to change and sacrifice for both of you, or you both are incompatible and continuing the relationship would likely be dangerous and toxic for both of you. I'm sorry OP. I hope she can start to see your point of view and come around, it seems clear you care for her very much and it is surprising she is this inflexible with regards to how you feel while all the time trying to justify it as 'no big deal' when it is, because it is to you. That's the foundation of a relationship: you don't have to agree on everything, but you need to be able to agree on which topics are important to the stability of your relationship and then resolve them.",1425420421,"the fact that she refuses your requests to stop being so flirty but then **also** refuses your requests to be present when it happens for your own piece of mind is not only extremely selfish, but suspicious.","selfish, but suspicious","selfish","but",TRUE,"extremely selfish , but suspicious","suspicious","extremely",NA,1

"corpzd4","It was the day we'd all been waiting for since the ascension of Christ: His return to Earth. At long last, after over 2000 years of anticipation and uncertainty, He had descended once more, putting to rest any doubt that He was the single true God of all creation. He came down in a great flash of light, and every living thing beheld the glory of our returned Lord.

It happened in Israel. Camera crews and hordes of excited people rushed to the scene, eager for a glance at the Messiah. But what we expected was not what we beheld. Rather than the friendly, bearded face of Jesus that we had all come to know and worship, we instead gazed upon the graying, middle-aged face of a seemingly disgruntled businessman. Many bowed in reverence, some simply stared in awe. But all were silent as we awaited what the great Yahweh had to say to His people.

He spoke in a strange language, the likes of which none of us had ever heard. And yet, we all listened and understood his words. ""You humans seek knowledge above all else. For centuries you have sought to understand my creation. You have sacrificed a great deal to know what I know; to see as I see. And now, for the second time in history, I stand as one of you. But do not be deceived, for I am not here to grant you salvation. I am simply here to grant you the vision you so desire; to put an end to your hopeless thirst for knowledge. And so, in exactly 24 hours, I will stand where I do now and answer the questions that plague your species.  Once all questions have been answered, I will return to my place in Heaven once more. This shall be the last time humanity ever gazes upon me."" With that, he dissipated in another flash of white light.

Hundreds, thousands, millions of people boarded planes and ships headed to Israel. Within hours it was impossible to find any means of transportation to anywhere outside the country. Indeed, so many people were arriving in Israel that there was hardly room to move. Most were forced to sleep on the cold, hard ground that night.

As for me, I simply stayed home. Being an atheist my whole adult life, I had very much disdain for this God and all the suffering he has wrought upon the human species. I had no interest in wasting my precious time boarding a plane to see his miserable old face. While there was one deep, burning question I wanted to ask him, I decided it was not worth the trouble.

24 hours came and went, and in another flash of light, there stood the aging businessman, exactly as promised. The radius of the crowd consisted of at least a million people, all just scrambling for a glance at our Creator. A great uproar was taking place, with everyone all asking at once their questions for the great God of all.

He put his arms up to signal for silence, and all obeyed. He said, in his strange godly language, ""I shall now answer the questions of humanity."" People remained silent, waiting for him to continue. But in the solitude of my apartment I spoke at the television screen, where the man's face was plastered in plain view. I pointed accusingly as I said, ""I have a question for you, o great God. Why is there so much suffering on this earth? Why is there such great pain? How can you allow millions and millions of people to starve, succumb to disease, die by the hands of their fellow humans? If you are truly an all-loving God, how can you just sit by while all of this happens?""

Suddenly, the man on the screen was looking directly at me. A cold chill ran through my spine as his menacing eyes penetrated my own. The air grew heavy with his presence and he began speaking once more. ""Why do I allow suffering, you ask?"" he said. My heart began pounding a million miles a second. Somehow, he had heard me. He was talking *to me.* I drew in breath shakily as he continued. ""I will answer your question honestly, but you will not like it. I do not just allow suffering. I create it. I *cause* it. All of the wars, plagues, injuries and shortcomings of mankind are my own doing. I infected you with the bubonic plague. AIDS, cancer, terrorism. Simply the latest developments of mine.

""You see, when I crafted the the first living organism, I knew that it would multiply and diversify. I watched it eagerly, not knowing what would form but realizing that it would be my own doing. The dinosaurs were a monstrosity, and an accident. I looked upon the ugly behemoths in disgust. Finally it came to the point where I could stand it no more. I had a meteorite crash down and destroy the beasts, leaving only the smaller, frailer and more beautiful creatures to live and reproduce. I watched the mammals branch off and primates come into being, and soon after, humans.

""I took a special interest in humans because you were different. You were no longer just a random result of evolution that lived simply to survive. You had broken free of the binds of nature that I had created. You learned, perceived, experienced unlike any other creature. You had an affinity for artistic endeavors even in your earliest stages. But you had something else as well: an intense thirst for knowledge.

""From the very beginning, you wanted to know how and why things are the way they are. Many humans attempted to explain it through various deities and stories. Others took a more organized approach, and soon science was born. You experimented, gathered data, came to conclusions. You were manipulating nature in ways that I had never intended. Some of your creations were innovative and helpful; others were wicked and selfish.

""But I came to realize that humans valued knowledge above all else. The vast majority of you did not care whom you harmed in your endless search for truth. Hundreds of millions of innocent lives have been taken throughout the ages because of your intense thirst. Your machines and mechanisms have made the world ugly and gray. You are but parasites upon the earth, feasting upon its life for the sake of your trivial pursuits. I saw that I had created a monster far worse than the dinosaurs.

""Why didn't I destroy humanity directly from the beginning? I saw hope in you. For although you had grown beyond what I ever expected from my creation, you were the only species that shared my affinity for creation. I wanted to be among you, so I descended to Earth as the one you know as Jesus. I treated every person I met with the utmost kindness and respect. I healed and helped my fellow humans. Yet despite all this, you rejected me. You betrayed me, mocked me, and hung me on a cross to die in a state of agony and misery. It was then that I saw the full extent of the evil I had created.

""My hatred for your species runs so deep that I did not want to destroy you. No, death would be too easy. Instead, I subjected you to countless diseases and terrible suffering throughout the ages.

"cogr284","&gt;Here I will make it easy for you:

Here comes more stupidity...

&gt;Bigot: a person who strongly and unfairly dislikes other people, ideas, etc.

Unfairly. Exactly. You're a bigot. Thank you.

&gt;Yes you may THINK my views are dangerous or whatever, but that is your opinion, and only your opinion. 

You have OVER ONE HUNDRED DOWNVOTES on this thread. ONE HUNDRED. Say again? My opinion and only my opinion? LOL, you're an idiot, man.

&gt;It is in fact an unfair one making your attacks, textbook bigotry. 

Nope, I backed up every one of my statements, and made you clearly contradict yourself to show how absurd your views are. Yours is textbook bigotry. Mine is textbook proving your stupidity wrong.

&gt;You keep providing exact examples of your bigotry

Says the bigot with logic issues who can't tell the difference between using a metaphor and hate, and between not paying a compliment and hate, and between disagreeing with bigoted views, and actual bigotry. You gotta try harder, man. It's tough to take you seriously when you keep proving you're stupid with every post.

&gt;So no one has the right to recognize clearly reckless and selfish behavior?

Not when it's not justified, no. There have been countless parents throughout history who aren't reckless nor selfish but the complete opposite, yet haven't been married. Are you prepared to make a blanket statement and say that's not the case? That every non-married parent in HISTORY has been reckless and selfish? And that every single couple who hasn't gotten married EVER, has not been able to be fully committed? Didn't think so. This is why you're a bigot, and a bad one at that.

&gt;I can label their actions without judging them as people.

Saying they're reckless and selfish is not judging their actions, it's judging them. Saying a couple who is fully committed to each other isn't really, just because they don't believe in your little piece of paper is insulting, degrading, and bigoted.

"cogfgdv","I've lately wondered about this: what is selfishness? Someone who hits the gym methodically every day, no matter what, to stay in peak physical health to maximize their well-being and overall performance is not being selfish, but disciplined. Yet in our society, we oftentimes see person B branding the dedicated as conceited and selfish, with the rest of the group agreeing while having another drink they'll regret tomorrow.

And therein lies the irony, i feel. I think we confuse our usage of the word 'selfish.' There are evil types of selfish, just like there can even be an evil 'good.' The evil selfish are those who take away from others, for themselves. The good selfish to me, are those who sacrifice to vest in themselves to have more to share in the future.

I think we often confuse this term and as a result, hamper the progress not just of individuals, but of our species. Parents put down their children who are selfishly hitting the books to get to a good school, rather than 'help' out in a ship headed towards a dead end. Groups put down individuals venturing out of socially accepted mores, in spite of the possibility that remains far ahead.",1423521504,"yet in our society, we oftentimes see person b branding the dedicated as conceited and selfish, with the rest of the group agreeing while having another drink they'll regret tomorrow.","conceited and selfish","selfish",NA,FALSE,"conceited and selfish","conceited",NA,NA,0

"cnz2q3l","/u/Ranrexo made some good points on why he doesn't like Joe Rogan.

&gt;This sub is the ying to his yang. We need some form of balance because the show has reached a point where you now have thousands of confused fans running around mimicking him and since Rogan refuses to take any responsibility about it then you need something to balance things off and pop some of these kids out of their delusions. What am I talking about?

&gt;Driving high. Rogan insists that being high makes him a better driver, and he does it repeatedly. Not only is this dangerous and selfish but if you go to his forum then sure enough there are people in there (who call him dad, which is just disturbing) also saying they drive better whilst high. Someone is going to die as a result of this one day, then what? How many kale shakes are going to make up for that?

&gt;The pseudoscience shilling. Again, pop into his forums and tell me he isn't selling stuff based on his fans' cult like following. It wouldn't matter if it was harmless stuff but there's people in that forum alone with actual existing mental health problems asking in the Alphabrain thread if they should mix it with their medication. People should be going to a doctor for medical advise, not some fucking random Onnit ""science advisor"". Look at the whole Bulleproof debacle, people on his own forum were shouting that it was a hoax but Joe kept calling them rude cunts and kept pushing his snake oil. He pushed it on practically every guest, telling them long tales about toxins and how his bulletproof coffee was the solution. It wouldn't have been so bad if he didn't insist that he felt the difference himself and that ""most"" coffee made him feel ill etc when it's clearly bullshit as most coffee doesn't have those toxins. Did Rogan apologise to his fans that had been warning him for months? No, he called them silly bitches and moved on to selling his next snake oil product.

&gt;His recent show with Matt Farrah. This Matt guy was acting like a douche himself but Joe kept picking on him for saying stuff like ""British people do X, Americans do Y"", and Joe would jump down his throat about how this is bullshit and we're all the same. This is the same Rogan who repeatedly calls Italians monkeys. Also of course British people have different customs and behave differently, it's a different fucking culture for fuck's sake. I wouldn't mind so much if Rogan actually knew much about it, but he clearly doesn't know shit about the UK (or most other places frankly) yet will ear beat a guest who is actually English and living in the US about differences between being English and living in the US. This sort of shit needs to be called out. He constantly makes pig-ignorant comments about other countries and cultures (which can be funny and is fine on its own) but then aggressively berates guests for it, even when they're actually right. Takes the moral high horse when it suits him and the bullshit ""it's only comedy"" when he does it and gets called out.

&gt;Constantly shits on industries and people he obviously has no real understanding of. Again not a problem in itself but he takes the moral high horse and says he hates negativity, which is just a cop-out. He's negative about LOADS of things, ALL the time. Then pop into his forum and his fans freak out if you pull up Rogan on something, saying they don't need ""negative"" people. It's pure cult-like echo chamber shit where anything they don't want to hear, even if it's the truth, is ""negative"". Then these dickheads drive around high because they don't want to hear your ""negative"" shit and then what?

&gt;The man has been hunting for all of 10 minutes, for the first time in his mid 40's, and he now behaves like he's Captain fucking Caveman shitting on ""lazy bitches"" and how corn fed beef tastes disgusting. This stupid motherfucker ate and loved steak for 40 years but all of a sudden because he's on some mid-life crisis shit then anything but grass fed is ""sick meat"" and tastes disgusting? And AGAIN pop in there and his followers are blindly swallowing his shit, running around buying grass fed this and that when they can't even tell the difference and it's all placebo. I grew up on an actual farm and had chickens when he was still doing splits trying to kick people in the head for a living, so it's grating listening to him talk about this life like he has lived it.

&gt;The man has literally millions of dollars and keeps banging on about being ""generous"" and how he loses all respect if people don't ""tip enough"". Maybe not everyone has the money to give away! MAybe if you see someone leave a modest tip it's because eating out is not only for the rich and even the people you tip are allowed to eat out, so what, someone on less then minimum wage should feel bad about themselves because they don't leave $100 tips? Deluded stupidity.

&gt;Uses the ""it's just comedy"" excuse way too much. He was bitching about ""trigger warnings"" in some films. Some people, through no fault of their own, have strong reactions to certain imagery. Maybe you've been in a serious car accident and saw the mangled corpses of your wife and kids etc, or maybe you were sexually assaulted/abused and certain scenes are going to be distressing. So there's a warning out of courtesy for these people. Rogan calls these people bitches. What an utter, utter cunt the man is. The world is not all jokes and comedy. He has certainly never told a joke that would be worth more than a person's peace of mind. Oh no there are trigger warnings so that traumatised people have a choice about what they will watch, it's time for Rogan to preach to us on one of his embarassing rants why this is wrong and he is right.

&gt;Those self righteous rants. The guy is only a few years older than me so it's grating to listen to someone who gets so much wrong pontificating about shit that he clearly has no deeper insight into than anyone else.

&gt;He has a positive effect on people and motivates some people to make their life better, but there are also negative influences and it's normal to call them out.

There's an entire novel's worth of assumptions bundled up in that last word, which we definitely don't have time to unpack.

""Selfish"" and ""untrustworthy"" are two completely unrelated qualities--you can be very selfish but very trustworthy, or untrustworthy but very not selfish--so let's look at them separately.

There's nothing wrong with selfishness in employment. Both employers and employees are right to act selfishly. The goal is to set up the system so that selfish actions by each component actually benefit everyone overall.

Untrustworthiness (or unreliability) on the other hand, is bad for both employers and employees. It is bad for employers to not pay their workers on time. It is also bad for workers to not show up on time. THe majority of work environments where employees abuse ""calling in sick"" are place where they don't even have paid sick time (or not much), so financial selfishness isn't part of it. It's just unreliability: *I don't feel like going to work today*.

&gt;  If people are constantly risking anything to get away from their jobs, then it's possible that there is a problem with the company as well.

"cmg5b5x","I was [on the fence](http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/23a9tu/i_used_to_be_on_the_fence_about_having_kids_and/) for a long time. Parenting seemed really hard and I wasn't really clear on what the benefits of kids were.

Now that I have one -- it is by far the greatest joy of my life. Having a child is unlike any other experience I've ever had. It's harder, but so much more rewarding than anything else I've done.

It has changed my scale/capacity for love -- the love I feel for my daughter is the most overwhelming, all-encompassing, powerful force I've ever experienced. There has never really been a cause I could imagine myself dying for, even really noble ones, but if it was a matter of protecting my daughter I would die for her without hesitating. I don't think I could have understood or imagined this kind of love without experiencing it firsthand.

I didn't plan on this reason, but I found that having her kind of made me a better person. I really have no choice but to be extremely efficient and organized, or else stuff that critically needs to get done doesn't get done. I'm way more motivated to make more money and have more job security. I feel more empathy for other people, and I feel more connected to the human race, like I feel very acutely that every struggle I have as a parent is something that other people have struggled with. And I like being part of this long, unbroken chain of creating people. 

And even though I'm a scientist, and I don't believe in anything supernatural, there is something a little magical about turning oxygen and food into a human being.

So I guess my reasons are entirely emotional and selfish. But I have no regrets and look forward to having as many more kids as is feasible/responsible.

edit: I guess I also want to add here -- I noticed in the ""why don't you want kids"" thread a lot of assumptions. Kids are expensive, but they don't have to be prohibitively expensive -- with some budgeting and planning ahead, we still have money for all the stuff and experiences we want. Also, all the ""I don't want my body ruined"" stuff is pretty offensive. My body is a little different, but I wouldn't call it anything close to ""ruined.""

I disagree somewhat (although not in the obvious way).

There is certainly room for a p2p knowledge sharing. It totally exists, and people in that clique will guard the information carefully to stop it becoming well known and therefore over-used and then patched.

Equally, there is a community where people release information to everyone. In return they get a warm fuzzy feeling, community recognition and maybe some internet points. Basically they go public for the kudos.

"ckm4dsd","I actually never rooted for him in the first place (by that I mean I never felt bad when he was at risk, I did however hope for him to get out of every situation so that the plot continues). 

Now hear me out, I know the popular stance on this is that his actions are more or less excusable in the beginning, like lets say season 1 when the whole world falls on his back and he tells us he cooks meth to provide for his family. 

That from the beginning rang like bullshit, it was more or less clear he did it for himself, and him not admitting that, not even to himself till the very end was a very weak and slimy character trait at least from my perspective.


He's this nice family man, picket fence, nice wife, 2,5 kids; whatever, but he is not a white (no pun intended) or even a grey character. He was a relatively socially adjusted slime-ball that realized his time was up and he never had any real impact on anything his entire life, despite having potential (I believe he goes into a monologue specifically about selling his potential regarding Grey Matter and how he's not making that mistake again).


He is not a nice guy, he's just afraid of being openly bad. He breaks bad when he realizes he probably won't even be alive in 5 years, and disguises his (selfish but understandable) need to get some action/make an impact as a selfless act for the good of his family. 


I have no problem with his motivation, I have a problem with him running from it, still keeping up the charade not only for others, but for himself. Jesse always rang more pure (99,1 % pure so to speak) in his motivations to me; he didn't bullshit others and he sure as hell didn't bullshit himself.


 I think it's interesting how misleading the appearances of it at the beginning were; you have this nice family man, someone who certainly puts on a nice smile and waves good morning to his neighbors throwing out the trash and picking up newspaper, and on the other side, you have the druggie kid. 

Their internal realities couldn't possibly be more opposing to the way they externally present. 

A thing that was very poignant for me in that aspect was when Spooge's (?was that that methheads name that kept telling his wife she was a skank) head was crushed with the ATM(achine); the word got on the street Jesse did it. Jesse was in this situation presented as being worse than he actually was, as opposed to Walter, who did so much reprehensible shit, yet still somehow managed to get out smelling like roses (this obviously does not apply to the later stages of the series, but it does cover for the first part in which I got this impression).

Have you ever hear of the new game called 'DOTA WORLDS, THE NEW RISING'?

It's going to blow your mind.  Within 3 months of it's release they estimate 80% of DOTA players will have shifted to it.  It's got more maps, creatures, gold, players, over $100m spent on balance alone, the whole bag.  Simply EPIC.  And guess  what, it's going to be completely 100% free.  That's right .. you can get a game you are going to love TWICE as much as DOTA,  that keeps you going for years and years with constant excellent and free updates.  The developers are so excited it's had 5 times the budget DOTA had, it's simply epic - like nothing you can imagine.

The game has been 100% be funded off the revenues that have been gotten from e-sports.  Incredible events televised and held at Wembley stadium - you've been to a couple, just simply awesome everyone loves them.  However its the new followers that have really bought in the revenue.  The people that would never dream of a great family day out watching 2 silent soundproved booths.  With their attendence and franchise purchases THEY'RE the guys that have bought in the $700m revenue that DOTA WORLDS required (before them, you could measure audiences in figures &lt; 10000!!!  Now everyone benefits with this incredible sequel to DOTA.  Did I mention, for free?

Oh hold on, esports was never able to bring in any revenue, so, DOTA WORLDS, THE NEW RISING has been cancelled.  Permanently.  Guys can continue with the old DOTA indefinately.  The best game they'd have ever experienced, for free, has to be shelved.  Because they'd rather DOTA never went mainstream because they wouldn't have personally liked the required rule changes.  Kinda' selfish, but fair enough  :/

"ck1qnqj","&gt; The act of suicide IS selfish. The PERSON who commits suicide is NOT.

This really depends on why someone is committing suicide. If someone thinks they are a burden, committing suicide would be a selfless act. However, if someone is committing suicide because they are in pain and suffering and suicide is their way to escape that, then I agree. But that doesn't make suicide wrong. It's ok to be selfish if your life is a living nightmare and you don't have young kids. It's selfish to expect someone to remain alive even though their life is nothing but pain and suffering. It's impossible to never be selfish and many suicidal people refrain from suicide even though it's what they desperately want because they're afraid of hurting other people. You can only live your life as a sacrifice for so long before you eventually have a moment of selfishness. 

&gt;  Saying that suicide isn't selfish is basically encouraging people to commit suicide by saying that the people around them don't matter because they can't understand your illness.

I don't see why you think if ""suicide isn't selfish"" that it follows that ""the people around them don't matter because they don't understand"" Seems like a non-sequitur to me. I think it's possible to think that suicide isn't selfish but that it does affect the people who care about you. 

Also, suicide is an incredibly hard thing to do and I think it's somewhat insulting to many suicidal people to assume that they are so easily influenced to commit suicide. Some people might be, but many are not. 



&gt;  Depression causes people to believe that the people around them would be better off without them anyways

This is just not even close to always being the case. This thread is proof of that. Many, many people refrain from suicide even though they're in incredible pain because they know it would hurt the people around them. 

&gt; It is likely that he thought that he had done his part and beyond that he meant nothing to anyone. 

You don't have any idea what Robin Williams was thinking. Respect him enough to not psychoanalyze him, because we're often wrong when we assume things about people. Unless he left a note for you, allow him his mystery. 

&gt; We should encourage people to think of the people around them because most of them DO care. 

If someone has the false belief that people don't care when in fact they do, then your recommendation would apply. However, to many suicidal people this will just come off as guilt-tripping. This thread is proof that many suicidal DO realize that people care. And if people are in incredible pain and they've tried repeatedly to feel better, it's cruel and selfish to not accept their desire to die. 

&gt;  You don't tackle it by assuming that the depressed mind gives you the correct perception of the consensus reality. 

One of the biggest myths about depressed people is that they're all irrational. Some are, some aren't. That goes for happy people too. But many depressed people are capable of thinking very clearly about reality. 

&gt; Suicide is selfish, that is why we are trying to avoid it. 

The fact that something is selfish doesn't make it wrong. Telling people not commit suicide who genuinely want to die is itself selfish. 

&gt;  We are trying to make depressed people realize that they are worth something,

If people feel irrationally worthless than that's fine. But it's a myth that all depressed people feel worthless. 

&gt; but one isn't necessarily selfish for killing themselves because their illness has lead them to believing that they are doing others a favor. 

Some suicidal people feel this way and some don't. Again, if someone irrationally feels like a burden, then I agree, it's important to emphasize that people care about them. However, there are other people who don't feel this way and when you say ""their illness has lead them to believing"" you're negating their own autonomy. Some depressed want to die because their life is filled with pain and suffering. If that's your life, it's not irrational to want to die.

"cjbvoqo","I read a thing on how to make caltrops on a certain website back in middle school / early high school and thought it was a funny idea.

Now I'm more like you which is interesting because I understand both sides.

For me, I was raised to not care about myself, which by logical extension made me not care about others.  I was also raised to repress my emotions, which are a package deal.  My parents are functionally sociopathic.  So were many of my friends.

So I didn't feel any sort of empathy for anyone because why would they matter because why would I matter.

When you become that numb and disconnected, you think you're way smarter than everyone else, and think stupid shit is fun for the adrenaline rush.

So maybe that's why the person did this. Being numb and hating themselves.  At the end of they day their lives are probably way more fucked than anything they could do to OP.

Now I care about myself and am more sensitive about things.   Because my feelings matter so do yours.  We're both people.  

I guess I'm still selfish but different things make me happy.  Like being a good person and stuff like that.  That makes me happy so I do it.  It's still about my happiness.  But my happiness now includes other people's too.  I still care about myself but have an expanded definition of self.

People who do stuff like what happened to OP aren't happy.

I've met a bunch of them and been one myself.

They're not happy.

When you look at this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-jdFth5QVU&amp;t=194 and see the host going 'I don't like that!' sheepishly, a few years ago I would've just laughed at him.

This comment is beautiful. Like seriously glorious; I got out of bed and sat myself down just to validate and add on to it!

OP, your girlfriend is basically me - right down to the immature arguments, need for attention, and confusing mind games, and honestly the way you talk and handle your girlfriend reminds me a lot of my boyfriend too. I was having major deja vu reading your posts and was feeling boatloads of sympathy and guilt until I came across this amazing comment that hit me like a bag of bricks reminding me of the other side of the argument (which ironically would be my side).

I think doublenut nailed it completely on the head - I agree with everything especially about how dealing with someone who can be people-pleaser (which you definitely seem to be) can make you feel like you're in a relationship with not a whole person since one person is basically living as a projection of what they think you want. It's especially infuriating when they are absolutely wrong about what they think you want (which also seems to be the case here).

In my opinion, she's annoyed that you are basically a slave to your work, and this reminds her of parts of your relationship where she wants you to stand up and be assertive (planning, dates, etc.). She also wants you to prioritize her over work, and be assertive about that as well - she's frustrated when you try to compromise and say you'll ""do your best"" because to her that's not being assertive about the matter, and also speaks to some fear in her that you actually prioritize work over her. She clearly still wants to talk about the matter because of the passive-agressive way she is communicating with you, but feels like there's no way she can get what she wants because what she wants is for you to understand where she is coming from and also (similar to you) not feel guilty about her own selfish feelings. This is why she feels the need for you to validate her feelings, and also feels like a ""horrible controlling person"".

As others have said, your girlfriend is pretty immature and selfish, but you're honestly acting that way too. It makes no sense for you to argue that your own time shouldn't affect her when it clearly does - now the conversation should be moved onto why and how to deal with that. Also you can't have it both ways - prioritizing work and not feel guilty for prioritizing work. The best thing for your relationship is if you guys just cut the bullshit, and have an honest conversation with all your flaws and selfishness exposed without pointing fingers, apologizing for the way you feel, or thinking about who comes out as the ""good guy"" or ""bad guy"".",1404808549,"as others have said, your girlfriend is pretty immature and selfish, but you're honestly acting that way too.","immature and selfish","selfish",NA,FALSE,"pretty immature and selfish","immature",NA,"pretty",0

"cidqrak","Uh... Short story? I put on the flair Thursday after finally getting a chance to go to an Episcopalian church. It's an Anglo-Catholic parish, which rocks my socks off. There's even altar rails with kneelers. :D Between folks genuflecting and crossing themselves, it was actually pretty similar to the Masses at went to at the Catholic church.

Long story? As I started studying the early church and asking the question, ""What did the early church believe?"" I ended up definitely not being Baptist. I wore the cross flair for a while, then had the hover text ""Anglicanish"" because my views fit well within the Anglican denomination, but I wasn't so sure I wanted to go that way because there are some absolutely wrong people within the Episcopal Church - like, there are seriously clergy that deny the bodily resurrection. So I wasn't ready to settle on that, just yet.

 I went to a few Masses, like I said earlier, and I think Catholicism is absolutely amazing. But there are a few areas that I know that I will never agree with, and I'm not going to be dishonest and say I'm in communion with Rome when I'm not. Some of the issues are big; some of the them are really petty and selfish, but they're all important to me.

I also spoke with an Orthodox priest and listened to Orthodox podcasts, but I was less keen on this one. I'm a Westerner, at heart, and that's ok with me. There's also some of the same issues here that I have with Catholicism, but not quite all of them.

I finally got the chance to go to an Anglican service (for a long time, being a youth minister back home prevented that, and then I ended up traveling every weekend for a month once I resigned). I went Thursday and loved it, because the worship is almost exactly like the Mass and therefore, seems faithful to the worship of the early church. I'll also be going tomorrow. So, I'm not ""officially"" Episcopal, as in confirmed, and I'm definitely not a long-time Episcopal, but I'm thinking it's home for me.",1403403253,"some of the issues are big; some of the them are really petty and selfish, but they're all important to me.","petty and selfish","selfish",NA,FALSE,"really petty and selfish","petty",NA,"really",0

"ci8v4n1","What is with all you book readers pining so hard for LSH this episode? (don't fucking answer that, you've all made your points already, they are terrible and selfish, but you've made them.) Giant events tend to overshadow the larger parts of any episode. (quick: tell me what happens in the first 40 minutes of The Mountain and The Viper without looking at a synopsis.) We've had YEARS to mull over the events of ASOS and they didn't all happen at once. In one hour, show only viewers got bombarded with the most information and milestone events in one episode, ever. Piling on a LSH reveal does nothing but compound all the shit already happening this episode, and make some of the more important stuff in it forgettable for a viewer. And all a book reader gets out of it is a smug feeling in front of their friends for holding back a secret for so long. 

And to anyone who hyped up that is was happening FOR SURE this episode: Do you know how TV works? We see LSH twice in books, thats two scenes only. Why on earth would you have Michelle Fairley sign a contract for S4 for one scene, and then a contract for S5 for one scene? I don't subscribe to the idea that they are combining the LSH reveal and [AFFC](#b ""Brienne's non hanging"") into one scene. I would venture a guess that EP 1 or 2 next season ends with LSH reveal, and ep 10 ends with [AFFC](#b ""Brienne's scene""). It makes hundreds of times more sense plot, and $$ wise to have it all take place next season and you should all be ashamed of yourselves for hyping up nothing and letting not just yourselves, but some TV only viewers down.

&gt; I am.

Hey, I commend your honesty, but you might want to work on that. Especially considering your apparent distaste for the former student leaders who acted the same way. 

&gt; For all you know, the visitors of this subreddit that you are referring to have just as much a vested interest in the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989.

&gt;&gt; No. Flat out no. They would talk about it differently. They would recognize the amount of tragedy in this event and would therefore not look nostalgically on pictures of ""Goddess of Liberty"". They would not call the student's ""heros"".

Just be careful in the future, as you can never be quite sure. Be careful judging others you don't know, as you really don't know what kind of battles they have fought or are fighting. 

I'm not familiar with whether or not the redditors here are looking at photos of the ""Goddess of Liberty"" with a sense of nostalgia, or just a normal interest. I would imagine that they are just interested. 

What's wrong with calling them heroes even if they failed to accomplish the change they sought? I agree with you that they failed to generate what they wanted out of the government and the Chinese Communist Party, but they did not fail to make their voices heard, including by those of us overseas who take an interest in these types of human struggles. I would not strike out everything that they fought for as a failure as long as it is remembered and still a simmering issue for many, whether or not you think anyone still cares. Many Chinese have decided to do what they can to work within the system to provoke reform in the years that followed.

&gt; It's just as easy for someone to turn around and point out your American flag flair and ask, ""why the hell should this be important to you?""

&gt;&gt; This is essentially a meta-post about the posters and their reasoning. Not the event itself. So I don't see it this way. And furthermore, as mentioned, this event is an indirect cause for me spending 1/4th my life here in China.

Take note that if you're trying to argue your point, you should attempt to understand the viewpoints of others, as opposed to disqualifying their views because you ""don't see it this way."" And telling us that the event was an indirect cause for you spending a quarter of your life in China only serves to make you sound hypocritical. You were not there during the protests. Neither were many of us. But you took an interest? Well, so can we.

&gt; Are you arguing that those people attempting to learn about the events as they actually happened is a problem, simply because they were not there or are not of Chinese descent?

&gt;&gt; Sorry (in this case) to answer a question with a question, but... do you think the posts about 6-4 on this sub-reddit are about people learning about history? That's not what I feel it is about.

Many of the posts have informative background information to give to others. If you would like to contribute, you may. I would rather hear about the history and the subsequent consequences than ""you should not care and you don't know what you're talking about"".

&gt; I think it was a failure because they did not bring about positive change even after the blood was spilled. 

Yeah, it did fail to that extent. But as I said, no everyone has forgotten. People find different ways to cope. They also find different ways to provoke change. From what I have learned about China, many Chinese have sought more official channels to negotiate change. There is also a certain amount of apathy.

&gt; I am not saying that they were ""wrong"" as a movement. But after the first week it wasn't one movement... it was everyone standing up for what they wanted to say. I think the initial motivation of many of the students was... selfish but understandable. 

The initial motivation for the students being there was to participate in the memorial service for Hu Yaobang, who was brought down by hardliners in the Party. They were also there to petition Li Peng and the corruption within the party. Some will argue that inflation was also a provoking issue. Either way, as you said, it wasn't one movement. The same can be said for protests such as Occupy Wall Street. There was barely anything to grasp for those protesting, most of whom I believe were just there to hang out.

&gt; I think some of the student leaders were very wrong to push past the point where negotiated settlements were possible. And I think that the egotism, relative naivete, and historical examples of the Culture Revolution led them to make horribly wrong decisions led to losing popular support, which in turn let the troops in, which led up to the 6-4 event.

Does that make them bad people? 

&gt; While no two events are alike, is it so wrong to learn from them, even if I am American?

Her best interest was to leave and start building a life without me.  For a promise we made when we exchanged vows to be broken seemed unfair and selfish...but how many promises did I break when drinking?

Since all of this was placed on the table, the important things began to shine brighter than the liquor bottle, we have made progress and fallen in love all over again.  It has been a very short time (my sober star) since the falling out but I feel stronger now about whom I am and want to be than ever before.  I can’t know what will happen with us in the future.  I know I will not drink today.  I sincerely believe that my life will continue to grow in a better light as long as I choose to be sober.

Good luck to you, stay strong.

(b) I don't handle or prepare meat for others. I have used cheese to prepare a meal for my husband (who's a functional vegetarian), usually as a final sprinkling and not an integral part of the dish. I also have a cat and a snake. Cat is pre-gan, but I'd get another cat after. No excuse for that or the snake. They didn't/can't choose veganism, but I could choose to not have carnivores as pets.

As much as I dislike the massive breeding and slaughter of ""healthy"" animals, I understand that no on is perfect and everyone is on a different point in their journey.

The problem is that everyone is passionate about something, and many of those things are huge issues. I acknowledge that I don't pay nearly as much attention to other important areas.

Again, yes you’re entitled to feel the way you do, and again yes it’s okay to ask this.  If he does NOT like the request, are you happy giving up the third altogether?  He’s entitled to call it off too, so think carefully about how *everyone* involved feels about what you’re asking.  The third may get turned off and decide she doesn’t want any of it anymore either.

A more logical break-down:

* You’re okay with his cock going into her body for pleasure
* But when the pleasure reaches its apex, he needs to stop immediately

"cfwdwes","Nah man.  I have the privilege of being really fucking weird.  I'm way out there, addicted to the comedic value of my outrageous personality.  I have joy brought to my life by the pure reactions I get from people being caught off guard by my mere presence and mannerisms.  

I sneeze really fucking loud.  I have strong opinions that are always against the grain.  I say no to people and events when everyone is saying yes, and vice versa.  I've experienced some extremely interesting and valuable events in my life all because I didn't care what the outcome was by popular opinions standpoint, only by my own mindset.  

I'm not a philosopher by any means, although I do own the [Tao of Pooh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tao_of_Pooh).  I like to think we are all just mechanisms of this giant organism called life on Earth.  Asking if a person gives a fuck is like asking if the ocean's wave cares that it scars and smooths the stone on the shore.  It's like asking if a tree gives a shit that it's roots are breaking a 20,000 year old ancient monument.  Those waves are going to crash and that tree is going to grow regardless if they have opinions.

I must have learned at a young age, when we're all very impressionable, that life just doesn't count at all if you give a flying fuck.  The clothes you wear, the items that you keep, the thoughts you dwell on - they are all arbitrary.  The only constant is your mind's eye on the matter at hand.

You can worry about the loose thread on your shirt and how your tie might look crooked, or you can smile at yourself in the mirror and say ""you're dapper as fuck"".  You can be upset that the traffic is piled up and some asshat cut in front of you, but say your swears to yourself in your car and get on with your day - don't dwell on it and let it give you heartburn.

Only fuck I have is the one where I don't *not* give a fuck about me.  I'm the only fucker that matters when I put my head down on the pillow at night and paste up my toothbrush in the morning.

It was a juvenile behavioral unit I think what they call it. A lot of people were there for drugs, so many were on their way to something like a halfway house afterwards. My roommate told me this stay was the first day she had been sober from hard drugs since December (it was February), I remember watching we call we meth addicted mom and saying she is breaking all contact with her, while sobbing, because her mom started her drug addiction. 

There were a few suicide attempters there too, like me. So many were because of pretty bad mental illnesses, like manic depression. There was a girl there with anorexia who weighed ~85lbs. 

It was hard but comforting. I had never in my life been surrounded by so many people who understood how I felt. I loved it on a way, I was sad to say goodbye, but I was excited to get home. My sister couldn't visit me while I was there, only my parents, because she was 12. That was hard, but I got to call her a few times and she wrote me a letter that my parents have me during visiting. You'd be surprised how long a week feels when you're locked up and away from everyone you know. 

I keep in touch with a few still. So many were in such worse situations than I was, with such weaker support systems. I felt very lucky leaving that place, and I also felt very spoiled and selfish. But it helped me a lot and I don't think I would change that expirience.

Took me way to long to admit it to myself but it's was the truth and I'm happier not being used like that.

I had moved on from the romantic part of our relationship, but it was hard being confronted with losing my best friend and simultaneously breaking his heart, when I had spent the past several years looking out for his emotional well-being.

As a young child i was the one described by teachers as 'mature' or like a 'little old lady'. The tantrums of my peers has always baffled me, and i wasn't keen on being childish (though i obviously had my many moments). I hung out with old people on the street, as they didn't argue or steal my toys (they loved me, i was a cute kid). I hung out with friends' parent's and grandparents at the birthday parties ''helping''. 

I was the youngest for many years, then younger cousins came along. My toys were donated to them as i'd allegedly outgrown them. Erm- no. I wasn't asked, and off they went. So from an early age my head was babies= steal toys.

More of my youth was spent crying at broken things from their destructive nature, and often getting the blame from my parents. I was right to resent them.

Now im older, i honestly see zero perks in them. Expensive, sticky, snotty, pukey and poopy. They can't help it for the good first 3 years of their life. I could accidentally kill it if my mind wandered (aka pillow in crib oops its suffocated....kid in bath wow its drowned- thats a LOT Of resposibility). You have to childproof everything. Holidays immediately cost twice as much as you can only go in the school holidays. Their priorities are all that matter. I'm sorry, i'm too selfish. I've not spent my entire youth training and learning to do things in my adult life only to never use them to train someone else (my kid) to do something they'll never do too...

i have severe depression, would i want to pass that on?... then...theres' birth and pregnancy. I'm genuinely disturbed by every part of it. Pregnancy, i once again see zero perks: getting fat, stretch marks, baby brain, swollen feet, incontinence, feeling sick...for a paracite- most prescribe meds for that kind of thing... but this one, when removed, its messy, you could tear, but are often cut- then there's recovery.

*Nice sand castle. Looks like you put some effort into it. Think I'll kick it over for a laugh.*

There are plenty of ARMA II/III mods that you would really enjoy that are not centered around the free-for-all sentiment. If you are set on DayZ (like myself) because of its incredibly unique atmosphere and the fact that it has zombies then there are a few things you should know. 

* You are playing a game without very many rules. In fact, apart from explicitly cheating/hacking, there really aren't any rules in DayZ. That is one of the things that makes the game a 'sandbox.' Want a survival tip? **Not everyone thinks the way that you do.** Because of that, you will meet people in the game who are kind and who are willing to part from some beans and soda to help a stranger. Also, (gasp) you'll meet people who are bloodthirsty and would want nothing more than to see you die, despite what you are carrying. An important point is that this isn't always (although often) because they think it's funny. It's an effective way to survive. Tragically selfish, but effective. This brings me to my next point.

* There is no correct or incorrect way to play this game. You don't want to kill any innocent people, or really any people at all? Great. You are contributing to what makes this game really awesome. Maybe you've heard of the [alignment system](http://i.imgur.com/oGxwbsb.jpg), though. Being a kindhearted player does not make you a better player. I could definitely be wrong, but I think that if everyone played by the same alignment, this game would be terribly boring. It would be boring (and frustrating) if every single person you came across killed you without warning. But that isn't the case because there are players like yourself.

&gt; There is no point in KOS, unless you are in danger yourself.

I'm going to respond to this just in case this is actually what you think and not just a manifestation of your anger towards dying and losing a lot of cool loot. There is *certainly* a reason to 'kill on sight' without any regard to danger. Sure, killing someone because you're low on food and water and you're hoping that they have what you need is sociopathic, but survival means everything to many.

"cdxb2g6","Having children vs. adopting children.  I know that it is a *big* thing to have for a most common issue, but we don't really have petty arguments.  We're having this conversation that I want my husband's children, and he feels strongly about adoption.  I love him so much that I want to have kids that have his eyes, his hair, his sense of humor.  Not only that, but I want to be able to see my father, mother, and grandparents shine through in my children in little ways.

My husband leans toward adoption because he's worried that instead of his eyes, hair, and humor, our kids will get his allergies and some of his family's less savory attributes.  It's a legitimate fear for any future parent, I admit.  I do worry about whether any kids I have will be prone to having problems with anxiety. The thing is, though, I love my husband fiercely and I want to be pregnant with *our* children.  I want to experience pregnancy, and I want to experience my husband while I'm pregnant, and while we raise *our* children.

Also, this bit worries me about adoption the most, and makes me feel absolutely terrible (but I don't want a kid to be hurt if I'm right): I have a real worry that I won't be able to connect and bond with an adopted child the way I would with my own child.  It might be different if I knew I was infertile, because then *my* children would be off the table.  But if I knew that I *could* be having my husband's and my own children, I just don't know if I could give that up for someone else's child.

 There was one thing that was bothering me a little playing the game. While I found the realistic use of period language, including slurs, very effective in portraying the setting; sometimes it got in the way a little of me empathising with some characters. Its usually been implied in the games that the assassins tend to have as noble opposition to social injustices. In that respect I found it a little jarring to hear Mary Read, an assassin, and Edward, A selfish but ostensibly noble protagonist; joking and making fun about an extremely barbaric torture device in the early levels of the game. The pear of anguish is one of the cruellest punishments enacted against homosexuals in these centuries and it is hard to imagine as noble character finding this particularly funny.

It's sad, but you know firsthand how hard it is to live with bipolar disorder. Living with someone with bipolar disorder can be nearly as difficult. It takes a strong, patient, understanding, forgiving, emotionally intelligent individual to make it through the long haul with a bipolar person. Your ex recognized that he wasn't strong enough to be those things for you. It's sad, and selfish, but it was the right thing for him to do. Trust me: I held onto a relationship with a man who judged me for my bipolar diagnosis. He considered it it a made-up disease for pharmacies to push pills at. He constantly threatened to leave me, he flushed my medications when I was sleeping, he antagonized me endlessly when I had panic attacks, and well... he scarred me for life.

But the thing is - he tried to cut and run, to dump me when I was diagnosed. I cried and begged and pleaded until he agreed to continue our relationship, and we fell deeper in love... but no matter how much he loved me, it didn't change the fact that he wasn't a healthy enough person to nurture a bipolar partner; he resented me for my diagnosis, for my symptoms, for my every attempt to get medical help or therapy, and he took it out on me in bizarre, abusive ways.

If I had let him go at this first red flag, I would have been in therapy, on medication for the last three years. Instead I've been ashamed of my disorder, afraid to tell anyone, afraid to seek help, severely addicted to marijuana to control my symptoms and anxiety attacks. 

Except now I'm with a new partner, who fully understands my condition and empathizes with what I'm going through. He is able to fully separate my symptoms from who I really am as a person; he forgives me completely for the awful things I say and do when I'm hypomanic, he's patient and nurturing when I'm too depressed to get out of bed. He's helped me get on the ball seeking medical treatment; he drives me to doctors and holds my hand in the waiting room. We both know that getting my bipolar under control is going to be an exhausting lifelong battle, but he's committed to fight it with me. He's equipped with the skills and the empathy to love a person like me. He's amazing, and what's more, he's the lover I deserve.

You have to understand that I wanted out of that life! I'd had my degree for a few years but the job hunt wasn't going well and the extra money was nice. I'm not making excuses-I know I ruined lives-I just want you to understand why I did it.
It was my last delivery. Ever. I knew I needed to get out of that life, so I was just selling off what I had left. Your parents were regular customers, but we'd always met somewhere public. I didn't want make a house call, but they were the only buyers I had left after I told everybody I was done selling and I had a hard time getting a hold of them. I.. I never knew just how bad it was. The house was a mess when I got there. 
You'd never know from the outside. The neighborhood wasn't exactly nice, but the interior of that house... Jesus. There was trash everywhere; used needles laying on the coffee table. You're so damned lucky you didn't have catch anything from your mother. I know she breast-fed you, there's no way they could afford formula. Not that they tried.
I didn't have to look hard to find my clients, your biological mom and dad. She was out cold on the couch, skin picked to hell and not an ounce of nourishment left on her bones. And you.. you were just laying there in her arms. You couldn't have been more than a year old. I'm so sorry, I just didn't know what to do. I couldn't leave you there. That woman who was supposed to be taking care of you. She was almost dead herself. How was she supposed to keep you alive? It's like, you know how on an airplane they tell you to put the oxygen mask on yourself before the child? She couldn't even do that.
I don't know why I picked you up. You just looked so helpless. This little baby, just laying there, done nothing wrong. I was going to put you back down, but... I knew there was no going back. I was going to leave this life behind but I wasn't going to leave you behind. You still in my arms, I left that last baggie in her hands where you were moments before and then I got the hell out of there. I never looked back. I stopped at the store on the way home and got diapers and formula; whatever I needed to support a baby for a week. Only, it wasn't a week. I talked to Child Services, adoption agencies. Foster homes, orphanages-I couldn't leave you to that life. You almost certainly would've fallen into the spiral I'd just pulled myself out of.
A couple dozen well-placed bribes later, you were ""officially"" mine. I never lied when I told that you were adopted, I just never told you how you came to be ""up for adoption"" as it were. I hope someday you look into your baby's eyes and you feel what I felt when I first saw you. That sense of responsibility for something so helpless, so beautiful and full of potential. What I did was wrong, and selfish but I don't regret it because it gave me you. 
I can't know how your feeling right now. You can hate me if you want. You can look up your parents-hell, you can even renounce me as yours. But I'll still pay for your college. I'll still love you.

Right from the beginning I knew and I almost broke up with her within a few months of starting to date.  But, like you said, everything else seemed great and we got along and I was overall pretty happy because of the new love and companionship.  It also felt selfish, but most of all I will admit that I was insecure and thought that if I threw this away, which is/was good in so many ways other than physical, that I'd probably end up alone.

So, like the OP, I asked friends what I should do and actually a lot of them said I should get out.  They said it is important and if she wasn't into it already, then we probably aren't compatible.  I didn't listen.  I knew it was an issue, but I basically thought that some was better than none and that the great parts of the rest of the relationship would make up for it.

And you know, that is true.  We have been through a lot now and have children and a mortgage and all of that.  We run a very functional house and don't fight too much.  But, there is very little to no intimacy.  It only got worse with time.  Our honeymoon was like too friends hanging out.  Of course the frequency increased when we were having children, but it was very much a means to an end type of intimacy.  There was no real connection although it was exciting to be having children of course.  After the last child she shut down, for years.

Then the talks started from me.  She tried, she wanted to be more into it, but she couldn't.  She blamed me, she blamed herself, and she felt pressured.  All that happened is that we grew further apart and had some forced intimacy that neither of us enjoyed.  So here I am a couple years after my first talk and I'm getting about the same or less than I was at the beginning because I've given up.

It just feels pathetic to have to go through so much work to try and get your wife interested.  You try not to take it personally because she's great in other ways and I think wants to want it, but she never will.  All the talking and ultimatums just lead to a lot of fighting and resentment because I'm basically trying to force her to be someone she isn't.  I could work out and get ripped and be the most attractive man in my social circle, but it's not going to change the person she is.  You give up.  You can't keep putting yourself out there emotionally so you basically shut that part of yourself down to match her.  You stop touching her.  You stop hugging and trying to get more affection.   You give up because you resent her having so much control over you like that.  She gets to feel desired all day every day and then pick when she wants to act on it, which is almost never.  I think they get used to the power and so you take it away.  You feel taken for granted.  You give them so much affection and make them feel desired all the time and they ignore it or consider it a burden.  That's where I'm at anyway.  I don't do it out of spite, but to protect myself and feel like I have some self respect and dignity.  Celibacy feels more empowering than constantly pursing someone who doesn't really desire you or intimacy.

So here I am, like you and like the OP so many years ago.  It's not that I have a bad life.  I try not to take any of it for granted.  I have little to complain about really.  I just feel alone most of the time in terms of having a partnership.  Hanging out with a good friend and raising children just doesn't feel like a relationship to me.  Raising children is amazing and I love doing it every day.  All the romantic parts of it and passion and desire and intimacy all feel forced and unsatisfying.  So of course I'm not going to just leave my kids and break up the family to go pursue the chance of having a passionate relationship, but I do dream of that type of relationship and at the same time know I'll never have it.  It's not fair to say I feel trapped, but I do feel like I missed out sometimes on having a real relationship with a woman.  I'm not even sure it's possible at this point.  I doubt actually that I would ever trust a woman again with that power over me, even if my wife and I didn't stay together.  It seems like too much risk.

See how this changes you?  If she doesn't somehow discover her libido and desire for you, then you'll probably end up like us.  You'll be happy I think if she's a good woman.  You'll have children and good life and be good friends, but you'll long to feel desired and it will change the way you see yourself and see the world.  That's best case too I think.  When I read the other stories on here I can see it can be much worse.  Some women/men make their partners feel horrible for wanting intimacy.  They belittle them and bring them down so they don't have to deal with it.  They make them feel like freaks who don't understand how things work.",1381268289,"it also felt selfish, but most of all i will admit that i was insecure and thought that if i threw this away, which is/was good in so many ways other than physical, that i'd probably end up alone.","selfish, but most","selfish","but",TRUE,"selfish , but most","most",NA,NA,1

I'd say that they most likely would not. I'd further say that they would possibly be dismayed or offended by the comparison between a parent who gives their child a very poor maths education and one who systematically beats, bullies or rapes a child.

A child who calls another child a name is not necessarily a bully. A man who feels depressed is not necessarily clinically depressed. Your teenage daughter is ungrateful and selfish, but she's more likely to grow out of it than to turn out to be a psychopath.

The main concern I have with being transgender is my fear of being forced to downgrade to the male gender role as a side effect of becoming male. It sounds petty and selfish, but I can't help it. I find myself secretly hoping for the best of both worlds, knowing I'll most likely get neither.

I also have criticisms of the MRM from time to time. I'm not technically an MRA myself (I'm egalitarian), but I find the MRM aligns much more closely with reality than feminism does most of the time, and at least makes visible efforts to be balanced, so I tend to get along with MRAs for the most part. I think if you voiced your criticisms in a respectful manner they would be (mostly) met with respectful responses.

I'm not particularly interested in connecting with other transgender people just because they're transgender. That label applies to me, but it doesn't define me, you know? I'll check it out, but I probably won't stick around, can't really say yet. Thanks anyway though.

You have to stop messaging her.  It doesn't just sound selfish that you are not respecting her wishes, it is selfish.  Selfish, disrespectful, short-sighted and undignified.  Probably not the words you want to hear while posting on MMFB, I know, but I'm in this for the long game.

The only thing you can do now to benefit the both of you is turn this rejection and silence into something healthy.  That's it.  If she loved you for who you were, if she was this positive influence on your life, it's time to show it.  And there is no better way to do so than to get or make some accomplishment that she always wanted from you.  

No, you're not going to get that instant satisfaction of sending it to her, or telling her about it, and getting to hear her reaction.  But you will have...honored her presence in your life while improving your own.  

So in order, I want you to try and do the following.

1.  Say you didn't just shitty and selfish, but acknowledge that you currently are.
2.  Mourn for your loss.  Accept that she's gone and that it has happened.

4.  Keep doing it.  Keep doing things that honor her while making your life better.

I'm always well-rested except when I get up early to do things like kayak or go to the US Open, and those things can be planned on the spur-of-the-moment without having to worry about the contingencies of others.  My life is very spontaneous in that I decide each day what I feel like doing and then I just do it.

I've been in a LTR for the last 16 years and last week we had so much sex that I had to take a 24 hour break.

Last night I had ice cream for dinner, watched a lot of anime, then hammered on Bioshock Infinte.  Today I will most likely smoke some marijuana and play tennis.  Unlike most redditors, I like clubbing and still party on the weekends in NYC - it's ridiculous amounts of fun and I've met tons of great people.

Also, I have the time and energy to work out (lost 70 pounds in the last 10 years) and right now I'm in the best shape of my life - I was able to rock a bikini this summer and two separate people asked me last week if I was over 30.

"cbcfm84","This will get buried, but I will tell anyways. 

Back when I was pregnant with my son (now 4), I was told around 3-4 months in my pregnancy that there was a 90% chance that my child would have downs syndrome due to these ""spots"" they saw on the ultrasound around his head.

I was devastated. I cried, slung some snot, then straightened myself up and had a talk with one of the women at the hospital that could help me through this. 

They scheduled me another appointment for a week later to come have another ultrasound done while they went over the previous one. You know, just to make sure. I was told about them sticking a needling in my belly to run a test. More commonly known as an Amniocentesis Test. They told me I had the option to do this, explaining the risks and what could happen to the fetus. I told them that if the next ultrasound still showed the spots, then we would schedule a test to make sure. We had a small amount of time to make a life changing decision, so we had to act fast.

That following week was the most depressed I had ever been. I was scared, because I had to think really long and hard if I wanted to keep or abort my baby. Deep down, I knew I couldn't handle raising one with downs syndrome. He wasn't planned, I was only 21, and I knew it would add a lot of stress and possibly a strain on my marriage. I know that sounds selfish, but I'm only being honest.

During that week, I heard a lot of talk from my mom and mother-in-law about how selfish and stupid I would be to have an abortion because I should ""woman up"" and do what God had intended me to do: take care of that baby. That added more stress on me, but I tried to maintain myself to keep from miscarrying or something along those lines. My husband and I agreed, in private, that we would abort. He just flat out told me that it was my choice, considering it was in my body, and that he would stand by whatever decision I made. I respected that. We agreed to tell them what would happen after the results. They could get mad and never speak to us again, we didn't care.

The day came to have an ultrasound. I was nervous as hell, too. They took my husband and I in the room and prepped me. She did her thing while I just stared at her, waiting for what seemed like forever. The woman looked at the screen, then at me, and then asked if I wanted to know. The first thing that blurted out of my mouth was ""It's there isn't it? He's going to have downs."" She shook her head and told me no, that everything look okay and that it must have been an error on the ultrasound from last time because they were using an ""older model"".  They had a specialist come in and check everything out to make sure, compared the last ultrasound to this one. That took a while, but I didn't feel as stressed as earlier.

They had a talk with me, apologized for any inconvenience they may have caused, and told me to have a happy pregnancy. I felt angry when I should have been happy. I had spent the past week worried, crying, stressing, losing sleep all because of an error in the machine. 

From there on out, every ultrasound and check-up I had was good. Everything looked great and he was a healthy baby when he was born, despite jaundice. 

Because of that happening, I realized I was faced with a huge decision in life. If that ultrasound would have shown those spots and the Amniocentesis Test would have narrowed it down to him having downs, then I would have chose to abort. Not because I wanted that ""perfect baby"", but because I knew what I would be up against if I went through with it. I wasn't ready for that package.

It's not that I think having a child with downs syndrome is horrible, but I just knew I wouldn't be cut out for it as a parent. We all strive for that healthy baby, and not everyone will get it. I give great praise to the parents that stuck it out and raised their child with downs, even to the ones just beginning their journey.

Does that make me a bad person? I don't think so, because my son is well taken care of and I strive to be the best mother I can to him. So far, I believe I have done a good job. I just know I am very thankful to have him in my life, and I'm beyond grateful that he is healthy.

Your replies to people's ideas and suggestions lead me to believe that you are not looking for a solution to save your marriage, but you want people to either confirm your retreat and loss of hope, or to encourage you draw a line and calm your fears in maybe moving on.

I am one of the later, and will be frank.

You have to put it to her clearly, as an adult, and let her know that while you love her, the lack of your sexual needs being met will have real adult consequences on the marriage. Tell her that if there is something that happened before to make her this way or if she wants to goto sex specialist / marriage counselling, she needs to tell you, and commit to it. But if she has no interest in solving the problem with you, then you have to take lead in securing your happiness. 
It will not diminish your love for her. You can not keep retreating back to a safe place because of fear, because in the grand picture of life, they are quite small.
In the long run you have to understand, that you are not in control of her mind and body, and if she is not interesting in changing for the better of the marriage (sounds harsh, and selfish, but let's not beat around the bush it is true), then you will take actions to take your life back and pursue your needs and wants ... 
Do not be afraid, we only get one run at life, and sitting around waiting for the problem to solve its self over the next 60 years of your marriage is not a way to live.

"cawtgwc","My reading of the ending is that, having lost his daughter and then found a new one in Ellie, he simply could not bring himself give her up. 

This is a selfish but realistic decision that I have no trouble believing Joel would make. We know he's not a hero in the traditional sense, maybe not even a good person. He has Ellie and nothing else, and if by losing Ellie he could save the rest of the world, that still leaves him with nothing. He is not a guy who sees the abstract principles behind moral decisions, he's a guy who for the last twenty years has been fixated on being unable to save his daughter.  

So, I think the ending of the game is that Joel saves his daughter at the cost of everyone else, and by that decision we are supposed to understand that he isn't a conventional good guy hero with a conventional character arc.
 
Whether Ellie believed him or not is unknown, but the look on her face made it seem like she didn't, but that she was willing to go along with the lie for a while. Joel's story didn't add up to begin with, and anyway Ellie clearly understands him at a very deep level. Still, her biggest fear is being alone, and everyone she's ever known has died or left her, except Joel. 

I like to think she'd go along with it for a while, but eventually return to SLC to try to find the Fireflies again. Whether they remain capable of synthesizing a vaccine is anybody's guess. All of the organized factions in the game seem to be falling apart quickly.

I wish the people here were less harsh, but I understand their frustrations. I used to drive when my seizures were not under control. Then, one day, I wrote a journal entry about how I would feel if I had a seizure while driving, lived, and killed someone else. It shook me up. I ended up moving to a place with really good public transportation, and I found a doctor who was able to help find the right combo of meds. I could technically drive now, but since no one here does, I don't.

Everyone else kinda gave you the ""epilepsy sucks, we want our life"" speech, so I think you understand that aspect of this. As far as being mad at your father... I get that too. It might feel like he was being ridiculous and selfish. But then, at the same time, you don't want to have those feelings about someone you miss so much.

"ca0yvxp","To clarify which conversation this is (as you said was difficult given your filled inbox) I was the person who argued that your moral evaluation shouldn't be applied to everyone in your situation.  And that my father has MS, hence my life and own happiness are the result of said (we'll call it selfish now) act.  I don't know if you'll have time to read and respond to this, but I've shifted gears to try and change your view on morality itself instead, which I suppose I should have done from the beginning.  I think you've made an assumption that Christian culture put in the common person's head, but  is a part of an outdated morality. (assuming you are not Christian yourself, since then I'd simply quote ""go forth and multiply"")

Declaring selfishness to be immoral is a *very* problematic stance.  

For one, moral principles themselves inflate the ego.  You already consider yourself to be making better decisions, or somehow be of higher caliber by taking these burdens upon yourself of denying selfish desire.  You're trapped to this, since your instinct to deny such an accusation proves the stake your ego has in being 'selfless'.  You benefit from thinking of yourself in such a manner emotionally.  This is selfish, but I would argue, selfishness is not wrong.

For two, intimate relationships themselves involve selfish desires by nature, so you needn't even consider your situation to conclude that pursuing a relationship is wrong.  Love is selfish, but it includes selflessness.  It's a mixture of selfish and selfless desires.  If love is wrong, perhaps you should consider intuitions rather than propositions (namely, that selfishness is wrong) when considering right from wrong a little more.

For three, ethics originated in considering what 'the good life', is.  If a desire for your own happiness is denied in the consideration of what's right or wrong, then you're sort of saying that it's right for you to be unhappy.  Or at least being happy is not what the 'good life' is about.  That's fine, but think about what selflessness is:  Looking out for *others* happiness.  You are in some sense denying them the good life by giving people what they desire, they will not be in a position to be as selfless as you if you teach them to enjoy the things you give them.  It seems to me you thus deny people a selfless lifestyle and hence deny them the 'good life'.  Paradoxically by doing selfless things you harm people's ethical habits.  At the very least, you've picked moral standards which simply *can't* be universalized.

If we at least allow for you to look after your own happiness to some extent but *for the most part*, act in other people's interests, we can probably come up with something along the same lines (still short of the outright proposition that selfishness is wrong).  Then you should realize that other people care about *your* happiness.  In fact, it's difficult for people to be as happy when their friends aren't.  If you are making yourself unhappy by denying yourself this selfish act, you are hurting other people.",1368842042,"it's a mixture of selfish and selfless desires.","selfish and selfless","selfish",NA,FALSE,"selfish and selfless","selfless",NA,NA,1

I have found that the best thing that came out of all this is actually because she was a bitch and took the internet and cable boxes with her. 3 weeks without TV or internet/Netflix and I'm already down 15+ pounds, I've gotten TONS of things marked off the to-do list, I'm caught up on my master's coursework, I'm eating healthy again, and finding MUCH more time to hang out with friends and family. 

I've actually realized how much the ex had been holding me back, preventing me from accomplishing numerous goals, and all around motivating me to do LESS with my life. I was really happy with her, but kinda hated myself for giving up on things &amp;amp; friends. 

So my mindset is now fairly selfish, but positive. I'm gonna get shit done. Gonna excel at life. Not gonna put anything else on hold any more. Gotta keep on keepin on!


Edit: forgot to mention, I also have set myself a schedule like you did. I now wake up EVERY day at 6:30 even though I start work at 9. I workout or run or cycle to work. I eat a good stable breakfast. Etc etc etc. 
I think it's worth pointing out how well this simple idea of setting a schedule and following it can keep you motivated and keep your mind from being distracted by negative thoughts.

The wedding isn't all about you, it's not Your Special Princess Day, regardless of what WeTV reality dress-shopping shows and teenaged redditors might tell you - it's primarily about your families getting together and celebrating the fact that they are now all family together.

I say suck it up and let them celebrate on their own dime if they want to.

Getting married without having a wedding or reception is the very definition of eloping, so your fiance is correct on that line of thought.

"c97hmgt","Honestly, it depends. That's why I think there are so many different names for it, because all the different names really mean something different.

A fuck is fun and carefree and good stress release. It's physical and selfish but both sides generally go in knowing that so they both worry about just getting their own satisfaction. It's like the song Night Moves. ""I used her, she used me, but neither one cared. We were getting our share."" I have not really partaken in this kind of sex. It holds no appeal to me. 

Sex as I see it is somewhat like a fuck, but with a greater personal connection. Maybe people who kind of like each other and have been on a few dates but are still just testing the waters with one another. Teenagers have sex a lot, because they often have a deeper connection with each other than two people who met at the bar, since likely they go to school together or some such. 

Making love, this is the prime rib. I spent a week with the love of my life in a hotel room during a conference for college theater about 15 months ago. She had been with an emotionally and verbally controlling and abusive guy since she had left me about 4 years prior. At the time she was still with him. 

But that week, there was nothing in the universe but us. I loved her, and if I'm honest with myself unfortunately still do love her more than I can even describe. And I knew every time she looked into my eyes and whispered my name that she loved me just as much if not more. 

Nothing in my life as ever been so perfect as sex with that beautiful woman. Cliche as it sounds, we were made for each, body, soul and mind. I have no doubt of that. 

Don't ever confuse making love with having to be gentle and tender and boring. Most certainly that will happen more often while making love, but it can be just as rough and crazy and hot as a fuck. But it's better because of the personal connection you share with that person. The trust you have in each other, the shared affection and the desire to please one another.

Making love is what I'm talking about when I say I want sexual gratification. It is the most incredible high. 

TL;DR: Is it that great? Yes, if you have a connection and trust with the person to a degree of at least friendship. The greater the connection, the better it is.

"c8dnoqo","Alright, let's do this. Episode 18:

4:50 - As Shiina pulls that incredibly overused old chestnut ""you're clearly embarrassed, are you sick or something?"" I realize I'm more used to the ""adorably"" oblivious character type being used for hyperactive characters than monotone Rei-likes. I briefly wonder if this means I'm being unfair to Shiina as a character, but then realize it normally doesn't bother me because I *already* normally write off hyperactive characters, and so isolating one of their many character flaws in a different stock model just makes it that much more visible to me.

7:20 - It is very funny to me that Class Rep-san's girlfriend gets all hot and bothered when he acts tsundere about Jin. ROMANCE! But really, I actually like this detail.

9:15 - This fight is really solid stuff. MAN, when this show actually gets around to PROGRESSING, it really knows how to make the best use of its best characters. Really makes me wish this were a single season show that cut the crap. It's like how Ano Natsu really should have been six episodes - I don't even know if it's more financially rewarding for these shows to go on longer, but it breaks my heart to see good dynamics stretched just to fill minutes. Pacing is critical to drama, and conflicts repeating themselves just murder emotional investment.

Getting off track here. This scene in a vacuum is pretty excellent.

15:00 - Solid, efficient use of flashbacks. Bad anime often has an unhealthy obsession with repeated flashbacks, but here they're used to tell a history in a brief series of broad strokes. More anime writers need to understand that the key to storytelling is saying everything that needs to be said in as few words as humanly possible.

Both the previous scene, where Jin is encountering that selfish but universally human fear of realizing someone only you know is incredible is about to finally gain the recognition they deserve, and this scene, which evokes an entire show's worth of baggage in just a few words (all the best shows have the embers of other possible shows inside them), ring incredibly true and are handled with a surprisingly light touch. Has this show changed writers/directors again?

And then I watched straight through to the end. Well, fuck. There are a couple things I could nitpick about this episode, but really, if this is any indication of things to come, then fuck yeah. I'd only planned to comment on this one as I watched because, according to the trajectory of the last 3-4 episodes, Sakurasou was swiftly becoming a train wreck I could only enjoy as an exercise in examining bad writing. This episode did a fine job of restoring Jin to the position of obvious best character, and also employed *understatement*, something I'd never have expected based on the incredibly overstated and repetitive last few episodes. This episode was strong enough to change my attitude towards the show from ""resignedly committed"" to ""cautiously optimistic"". It reminded me why I stuck with this often infuriating show in the first place.

-EDIT- Goddammit, I *always* forget about the post-credits addition. Well, this one was not good news - it reeks of a contrived attempt to add false drama to the last act of the show. Sakurasou itself is not in any way critical to the primary themes and conflicts of this show, and if they decide to focus on a generic ""save our sitcom"" conflict instead of the far more unique and interesting issues of long-term and relative creative success, the show will be worse for it. Here's hoping this doesn't derail the plot just as it was getting back on the tracks.",1360641914,"both the previous scene, where jin is encountering that selfish but universally human fear of realizing someone only you know is incredible is about to finally gain the recognition they deserve, and this scene, which evokes an entire show's worth of baggage in just a few words (all the best shows have the embers of other possible shows inside them), ring incredibly true and are handled with a surprisingly light touch.","selfish but universally","selfish","but",FALSE,"selfish but universally human","human",NA,"universally",1

The reason I haven't apologized is because I really don't like to admit to myself that I hurt you and others along the way. That sounds immature and selfish, but at the core of me, I guess that's who I really am. It seems easy to me to just gloss over all the bad I did and try to be happy - to convince myself that I'm a good person, not the horrible monster who cheated on you, lied to you, and broke your heart. 

With all that being said, deep down I am incredibly sorry for what I did to you. You didn't deserve that. You didn't deserve me. You didn't deserve all the pain you went through. Even though I never said it before, I was always sorry. I am sorry. 

Many times I downplayed the situation, blamed you, and pretended like I wasn't wrong just to make myself believe it. No one else believed it, I now realize, but for a few short moments in my life I believed I didn't make such huge mistakes. 

You know, I probably haven't grown enough over the past 4 years ago, but I have grown some. I've grown enough to know I can't hide from my past and pretend I didn't hurt you. 

I hope that you have healed. I hope that you've grown. And I hope you can bring yourself to truly forgive me. Because you don't deserve to waste another day on any anger or ill-feelings towards me. You deserve happiness, and I""m sorry I've robbed you from that.

"c71naey","Well, a big theme of both Buffy and especially Angel is the idea that not all men are good and not all demons are bad. We have to remember that vampires are humans who are possessed (and reanimated) by demons. These could be evil demons, they could be selfish demons, they could be lazy demons, they could be altruistic demons (like Clem, but that is unlikely). That is why vampires range from benevolent (Harmony) to horrific (Angelus). 

Spike's demon is just somewhere in the middle - he is selfish, but mostly indifferent. His demon side lets his human personality shine through. William's physical body, memories, and personality existed without his soul, but without a soul, he couldn't hold the demon at bay. However, once he got his chip, the demon lost interest and William starts shining through more and more. Eventually, his unrequited obsession with Buffy in Season 6 brings his demon back, and William overpowers it and goes in search of his soul.

Angel and Angelus are so fundamentally different because the demon that takes hold of Liam is a sadistic, malicious bastard who actively wants to destroy everything good in the world, and hates the fact that he has to share the body with Angel. I, also, have a theory that when Angelus was cursed, he got Angel (a new soul) and not Liam's soul, and that is why he seems to be a completely different person.",1352959075,"spike's demon is just somewhere in the middle - he is selfish, but mostly indifferent.","selfish, but mostly","selfish","but",TRUE,"selfish , but mostly indifferent","indifferent",NA,"mostly",1

"c6ba8wa","The benefits are a subjective thing that only you can weigh out for yourself.  I live with a couple with a new child, but fortunately I'm isolated in a basement away from him so I don't have to deal with him much.  I also know two other friends with kids, and here's what I've learned: the benefits of not having children are simply not having to deal with the following realities:

9/10 times, the first 3 years are absolute hell.  The child cannot communicate in any other way than screaming for the first 1-2 years, and there is often no seeming reason for said crying.  You can pretty much kiss a full night's sleep goodbye during this time period.  They also have no concept of value, and they are naturally curious, so they will try to do anything with everything, such as using lipstick to paint the carpet or emptying an entire box of oatmeal across the entire house like confetti.  The stress from not being able to take your eyes off them starts to weigh heavily on you.

Then there is the cost factor.  Unless you want to do a home-birth with a midwife, your average no complications birth costs about 10-20k in a hospital, and if they have complications, you will get completely raped with bills.  Feeding and clothing kids can usually be pretty cheap, as they don't eat much and there are tons of hand-me-downs as kids grow so quickly that they rarely wear an outfit more than a few times.  Still, there are hidden costs such as babyproofing, strollers, rockers, toys, baby gates, cribs, etc.  They say the average child from 1-18 costs well over six figures on average, and that's not including a college fund.

Now this is just assuming your child is healthy and generally well adjusted.  Throughout a child's life, there can be many other headaches such as ADD, bad report cards, parent-teacher meetings, one day you could find your kids using drugs, your daughter could get knocked up at 16 or your son could end up getting a girl pregnant.  Still, I'm going to gloss over a lot of that.

For many of us, the perceived benefits of having kids just isn't worth all of that potential work and responsibility.  A lot of people say that makes us ""lazy"" and ""selfish"", but look at the flip side.  If you are a parent, but put in a minimal effort then you are lazy and selfish.  You shouldn't be a parent unless it is something you have your heart set on, yet about half of all children born are accidental babies.  Those situations are motivated primarily by guilt rather than desire, and it often ends up with piss poor parenting.

Childfree folks don't want kids because we **do** realize what a responsibility it is.  We realize that kids should become your life if you have them, and not some accessory that signifies a special status of ""parent.""",1348206491,"if you are a parent, but put in a minimal effort then you are lazy and selfish.","lazy and selfish","selfish",NA,FALSE,"lazy and selfish","lazy",NA,NA,0

"c5xhbuy","Friendship is the step after acquaintance. When you get around to knowing someone, a mutual understanding about other people's strengths and flaws which become apparent over time. To be a friend is not so much being a buddy that is good to hang out with. But to be that person to point out when your about to make a terrible mistake and support you after the damage has been done due to being ignored. We can be very ignorant and blind sometimes.

One thing to note. It is rare for a friendship to last forever. Things happen, people slowly drift away, meet new people or get different conflicting interests. It could be as simple as moving to a new location. Attempts will be made to stay in touch, and share things that happen but it will never be as strong as it ""used"" to be. But that is ok. We move on as well, meet new friends and the cycle continues.

We end up making new friends that match the new interests we find, or old interests that you hold onto that old friends no longer find that interesting.

Let's put this to a pony example. Episode 1 Season 1.

[](/twipride ""I don't need no pony!"")

Twilight Sparkle is not entirely interested in making new friends however initiative does not always has to be taken by both parties.

[](/raritynews ""What you need, is to fix that dreadful mane."")

Sometimes a common interest is in someone's past as Rarity is fascinated with Canterlot which Twilight happens to live in or has lived in. One could argue this is a tad selfish but everyone is selfish it's what we do. Luckily our own interests are sometimes to benefit others which is where selflessness comes from.

[](/rdhappy ""My Bad!"")

Rainbow Dash's large ego enjoys a challenge, more then that enjoys winning. Twilight Sparkle initiated a challenge to trick Rainbow Dash into clearing the sky which is her task in the first place. Clearing the sky in ten seconds flat leaves a shocked look on Twilight's face which amuses Rainbow Dash. In this situation Twilight was not exactly treated well, being tackled into the mud, getting soaked and being subject to high speed wind does not make for a good impression. However note that Twilight is not the one with the initiative but Rainbow Dash, who from her perspective found Twilight to be a riot. Which may or may not be her fault.

The interest here is entirely Rainbow Dash which is alright due to how initiative does not have to come from both parties as long as the mutual understanding is established.

[](/hmmm ""Did I give her enough pie..."")
I find Applejack to have one of the more interesting takes on initiative in this example. She comes across a tad strong which can intimidate some, I know I wouldn't enjoy being in this situation. The interest is making a new friend perhaps the only one with a selfless interest.

[](/flutterwhoa ""..."")
As for Fluttershy's initiative. It's Spike, hands down. If Twilight didn't have Spike with her neither of them would of made the initiative. No Interest nothing to start a mutual understanding with.

[](/ohhi ""What's wrong with her mane?"") It's Pinkie Pie she is friends with everyone. To wonder what her interest is would be missing the forest for the trees. Though unlike Applejack, Pinkie Pie's interest in making friends is more selfish. Almost to a compulsory degree. Though we don't really see that till later episodes. Just for the first episode she is shown to be extremely extrovert. And perhaps not entirely with us.

In the end however interest and initiative only goes so far as becoming acquaintances. Mutual Understanding comes later during Episode 2.

[](/nmm ""Everything!"")

Nightmare Moon is the glue that brought these ponies together under common ground. And a similar interest being to help stop Nightmare Moon with the Elements of Harmony. During their adventure they each had a chance to show their strength's where at first their weakness's were first mostly visible. It takes time to know someone before they become the noticeable traits. Till then we only know what we see and assume. We tend to be wrong.

Rarity shows her Generous traits.

Fluttershy shows her Kindness.

Rainbow Dash's Loyalty.

Applejack's Honesty.

And Pinkie Pie being Pinkie Pie.

However if we look back we can see that these traits were already there during the first impression stage of acquaintance. However they were obscured by assumptions and personal interests that are at the time, more important.

Besides Applejack, she was honest.

In the end however a mutual understanding is nothing without the other party. Twilight Sparkle who at the end accepted their initiative of friendship.

So to summarize with a **TL;DR:** Friendship is a mutual understanding between two parties that requires similar common ground to begin foundation. At least one needs to make the initiative to start the level of acquaintance before friendship can begin. Before that initiative however requires a interest to start with which can be both selfish and selfless in reason. But most of all it requires time. Just don't expect it to last forever. Forever is a long long time.

"c5rzqzf","&gt;I'm just amazed that Rand missed the fact that humans are cooperative pack hunters that display complex social structures. Our entire evolutionary survival strategy revolves around selfless cooperation.


They display complex social structures in an attempt to help themselves, which still feeds into the idea of being selfish.

Evolutionary survival does not revolve around selfless cooperation. It revolves around selfish cooperation. People cooperated and formed tribes, hunting packs and etc because it was in *everybody's* interest.

By and large, people are selfish. For example, if you told someone they could have $100,000 dollars for themselves and nobody would know. Or that they could split it amongst 3 other random people, most people would pick $100,000 for themselves.

However, if you said you could get $100,000 dollars for yourself *BUT* people *WOULD* know, the number of people who would share would go up substantially. Why? Not because they're ""selfless"", but because they are selfish. In a society where selfishness and greed is ""morally wrong"", they disadvantage themselves by exposing themselves like that. So even when they act ""altruistically"", they are being selfish.

Of course there are the exceptions to people who are actually altruistic and selfless, and then others who are completely ruthless and selfish, but by and large people are selfish.

Arguing that any altruistic act can interpreted as having an underlying selfish intent is...

First, unfalsifiable: we don't have access to other people's mental states.

Second, absurd: just because we can *interpret* behavior that appears to be altruistic as being selfish doesn't *make* the intent selfish--it actually has to *be* selfish, but that requires access to the private mental states of others, and *prima facie*, altruistic behavior is better explained as resulting from all sorts of intents, both altruistic and selfish, depending on the individual, rather than ruling out one possible intent *a priori*.

And third, any example of altruistic behavior that strongly tugs at our intuitions as indicating altruistic intent can be handwaved away with the *ad hoc* adjustment of the term 'selfish' to cover this new act. For instance, saying that anonymous philanthropy ""Improves some aspect of another person's life which indirectly improves one's own"" stretches the whole conceptual web surrounding the term 'selfish' so much that it becomes laughable.

"c5bfnv1","Alright, you asked for it!

My two Dovahkiins are two Argonian females, Stares-At-Shiny and Ji-Teri. Both of them travelled to Skyrim in caravans with a group of Argonians they never met, hoping to find a better life. Stares-At-Shiny (or Sas as I call her) always got in trouble for not being able to keep her hands off of all things valuable. Ji on the other hand is superjumpy and will run in fear from a squirrel. Ji discovered at an early age her aptitude for magic, as she discovered by burning her caravan down. Sas was quite good at hunting for the animals couldn't hear her approach.

Sas was the first to find out she was dragonborn but hated the role. She did visit the Greybeards and did what they asked her to do but felt she was being used as a puppet. She decided not to fetch the Elder Scroll and returned to her favorite hobbies - stealing for and from the Thieves Guild, and killing for the Dark Brotherhood for the sport. She's collecting all the Deadric artifacts so she can display them as trophies in the basement of Honeyside, her favorite home. She has stolen so many ingots, gems and soul gems, that she uses the whole of Proudspire Manor (which she bought without the town knowing) as her personal safe. She has a soft spot for children and ended up buying the orphanage in Riften, paying regularly for its upkeep. She has a not-so-secret relationship with Vilkas whom she visits often. She's been regularly accused of being a bad person (often by Vilkas), which she doesn't deny, as she has no problems getting other people in trouble for taking their stuff or killing their friends.

When Ji found out about her dragon heritage she panicked and fleed to the North. There she joined the college of Winterhold hoping she wouldn't stand out. As the college got into more trouble, her talent for magic overcame her clumsiness and she was able to sort out the mess. Soon after, the Greybeards asked for her help and while scared stiff, she was convinced to go find the Elder Scroll. With the help of Erik the Slayer, whom she married later on, she retrieved it without running too much from the scary Dweomer robots. By the time she had to negotiate with the Imperials and the Stormcloaks to catch a dragon, she had discovered Sas' double life and asked for her help. Sas knew she couldn't kill Ji and agreed when Ji promised she'd keep her life a secret, and the negotations went well with Sas playing the bad cop and Ji playing the good cop. 

Together they entered the ruins that lead to Sovngarde and defeated Alduin. Sas went back leading her double life of being a mysterious cloaked figure in Solitude and a generous thief in Riften, while Ji-Teri works to earn the title as Archmage (even though it was offered to her, she knew she was way too inexperienced) while overcoming her fears by seeking out all the Dragon Priests and word walls. Strangely enough it was Sas who ended the war by helping the Imperials to win, but only because the soldiers on both sides had the tendency to kill her marks first by accident.

**As** for Dawnguard, Sas will most likely join the Dawnguard as she dislikes anything undead and loves the idea of throwing chaos into a group that she deems arrogant and basically competition, while Ji (who's less scared due to her experiences but still nervous) will join the vampires in the hope to understand them and communicate with them and the rest of Skyrim, in an idealistic hope to unite them without any more bloodshed.

"c4rvx4c","People shouldn't have a ""safety net."" You incur the consequences of your own actions, be they good or bad. I have always supported going to family, churches, and charities if you need help. If you have a truly Capitalistic state (which America is certainly not, not since 1913) then people would be far more willing to help others out (why should you now? You're already paying high taxes for ""the poor"" or whatever. God has been replaced by God-Government, and the nanny state.)

The best system possible in this life, IMHO, is Capitalism, with a faith-based people (This is EXACTLY what the Founding Fathers said.) People who can take home everything they fairly earn have more to be able to give. Of course many won't, and that's their prerogative, albeit selfish, but many, many will. A lot of churches are corrupt, but in my neck of the woods, many churches have ""community"" funds. They take your voluntary contributions and use them to help the community and people in need. This, on a corporate, and individual level, is the best thing you can have.

In short, society should NOT be given a safety net (as it is unfair and encourages them to be lax) but in their times of need, everybody should be willing to help clothe and feed them.

With that said I can understand why some feel the need to adhere to their perceived notion of an honourable fight. However, if I'm capable of understanding this then I can only assume that others can be capable of understanding that the same logic can be applied to those who do not choose to follow the set of unwritten rules.

This leaves a sense of neutrality, as neither side is right or wrong for following the rules. The issue I hold is that those who do choose to follow the rules feel it's their right to tell others how they cannot behave for doing nothing beyond using the mechanics of the game in the form it allows. 

I find this ""you shall not"" attitude not only selfish, but childish. Quite frankly, it's wrong and disrespectful. The game has a set of rules that have been laid out by the developers, these rules cannot be broken. I do not feel any one person has the right to tell another that he or she cannot do something that isn't covered by these inherent rules.

I feel that many players who are part of communities such as /r/darksouls forget this, and get too caught up in these little bubbles.

I just want to make it clear that an ethical, logical, moral core exists in the ""liberal"" belief system, just as much as in the ""conservative"" belief system. There are deeply moral/religious/thoughtful people in almost every belief system.

Some conservatives here are only exposed to the more militant/extremist liberals on a personal basis (in conservative towns, for example), and truly might not realize that there are very ethical, rational, kind, thoughtful, religious, and peaceful liberals in the world.

Also, even a small number of inappropriate downvotes are a symptom of a larger problem in real life. I am increasingly concerned about the moral impoverishment associated with ""tyranny of the majority"" - the lack of empathy displayed by militant/extremists in a moral majority, and the ""trickle-down"" effect of that lack of empathy to the majority members.

If a minority says something that is peaceful but contrary to the majority, it's really hard personally to have even a few angry militant/extremists (who feel more justified because they are in the majority view) make horrible assumptions about your character. As a result they privately lie about you (because they have falsely jumped to conclusions about what you believe), and publicly try to teach you (because you are clearly ""misguided""). It is very unpleasant to deal with.

Their behavior will always make a few ethical people angry enough to speak up, but if the militant/extremist aspect is vocal or strong enough, it gets harder and harder socially and personally. Partly because it seems more pointless. The militant/extremists are less likely to listen to what you're actually saying. The more of them that there are, the more ""righteous anger"" that they feel - ""believe in Trayvon's innocence"" starts to feel like a moral code as important as ""do unto others,"" worthy of ""legal"" protection.

So many of the world's horrors have been related to an increasing number of militant/extremists who make life unpleasant for those with an ""alternate"" (but perfectly moral) way of interacting with the world, to the point where the rational, ethical majority feels pressured into silence (or do not think critically) about their personal moral convictions, who keep quiet in order to protect their own safety and community standing, and partly because the militant/extremists are truly unable to question their own beliefs so it feels pointless to ask.

I made the mistake of speaking up at my (VERY liberal) law school about the Zimmerman case. I said, ""I believe that 'innocent until proven guilty' is a moral, not a factual stance; as a future attorney, I feel an ethical obligation to discourage mob trial by media: the rules of evidence are nonexistent and some aspects of it seem like a modern 'stoning.'""

The vast majority of people thought it was a noncontroversial stance, which it should be and is to the vast majority of human beings in any political group.

Yet the less ethical, less empathetic ""militants"" of the liberal majority hear ""wait, let's be fair,"" privately told other people that I am a racist (a few said it to my face) and other horrible small-minded character ""name-calling,"" and many publicly tried to ""teach"" me about ""race in society,"" assuming without thinking that I have zero knowledge about the way the world works or empathy for others, that I am ""on Zimmerman's side,"" and that everyone within the majority agrees with them not just about the case but about me/my reaction to it.

They were outrageous enough that several people spoke up against them, and my email inbox was flooded with people saying ""I secretly agree with you, they are wrong,"" but it is general unpleasantness to deal with a militant/extremist who feels morally sad and angry when others disagree, and who is truly incapable of seeing the other side.

I have empathy for the militant/extremists. I used to be one. When you see genuine injustice in the world, and you believe that your solution is better than other people's solution, it's really hard not to feel sad and angry and upset when you proselytize but can't convert others to your view.

I now am much more humble and willing to admit I do not have all the answers, that I both value and admire other people's personal religion and moral solutions, and want us all to just leave each other alone more rather than trying to constantly ""convert"" each other - there are positive, spiritual, peaceful, reasonable/rational elements like that in (almost) every belief system no matter how awful the militants might be. Which is actually really amazing, it's a spiritual breakthrough to have faith that you can discuss things calmly with others, and that it works better than conversion by force.

Anyway, I'm perfectly willing to have ""courage"" and speak up on behalf of others. It is tougher and seems more pointless to have ""courage"" and speak up on behalf of myself, especially when militants seem/are so pointlessly angry and looking for a target.

To be ""professional,"" I don't want even a few ""inappropriate downvotes."" There is a lot of selfish but realistic minority pressure to keep quiet in order to avoid conflict, and to maintain your community's sense that you are a good person without even a few people out there who believe that you're ""bad.""

I would love to go into politics, for example, but I think I am far too sensitive and care too much about being liked and respected. When all people know about you is what the militants of their belief system say (that I'm a Godless atheist who preaches sin, or whatever else untrue things), even reasonable people in that belief system start to think that you're a bad person because misinformation is prevalent.

As a religious person who grew up as a third-generation atheist with some Jewish cultural background and Christian friends, I am a Godless atheist to some people, a Christian to others, and a Jewish person to still others. I pray to my personal God, but I am hesitant to say it's ""the same one"" that other people pray to, particularly if they believe in a ""militant/extremist"" vindictive God who punishes those people with a personal God even slightly different than their own. God is too big for one religion, or even any religion, I have met religious atheists (empathetic, good people who believe in miracles of nature and life and have faith in the goodness of all) and atheist religious people (militantly converting those who are ""mistaken"" even within their own religious group, because they are so convinced their own view is correct in every single aspect, and fail to see the beautiful ways that we all agree).

Oh well. It doesn't matter. Except it does - there are strong pressures to silence even the most ethical members of a minority viewpoint in real life. Somehow we have to figure out how to value diversity of opinion rather than squabbling.

Public law and private enforcement seems the best way to me - eliminating public education and replacing with all-private schools, for example. I am happy to let parents teach their children Creationism. It is not child abuse, they are not harming anyone, I am not about to use government to try to ""forcefully"" change peoples' belief systems. It doesn't work. Giving ourselves room to breathe, to stop feeling like our belief system is under attack, enables us to feel less defensive about our views - and paradoxically more likely to be able to ""convert"" each other. At least to see that other people are peacefully finding their own moral, spiritual, religious way of interacting with the world and finding meaning in life, and that if we want to convince them to change, that will only happen through peaceful discussion. Not force.",1336037876,"there is a lot of selfish but realistic minority pressure to keep quiet in order to avoid conflict, and to maintain your community's sense that you are a good person without even a few people out there who believe that you're ""bad.""","selfish but realistic","selfish","but",FALSE,"selfish but realistic","realistic",NA,NA,1

"c4f28s8","&gt;Why would God, if he is omniscient, create humans (and also the angels that became demons) that he knew would turn away from him, which he knew would result in pain and suffering? Would that not ultimately make God the originator of sin?

Everything that God creates is Good. Freewill is good, but evil is neccesary for its existence. The giving of freewill was an act of love, because it is a limit on God's soverignty. Love is determined through ones sacrifices. Since God is love, this was all done neccesarily.

"c4av7i7","She didn't leave a note because it's a time machine. And the Doctor did specifically tell her that she could be back at any time- she even asks if they could be back 'tomorrow' and he said absolutely. And she would've come back because she is loyal to Rory. Amy is an adult, she would've eventually decided ""it's time to face the real world"".

Cold feet isn't abandoning your responsibilities, it's when you get nervous because you're about to make the biggest commitment ever. And as we established, she would've gone anyway, even if her wedding wasn't so close, even if she didn't have cold feet, and even if Rory happened to be there and came with them.

&gt;""Rory assumed she was not going to go time travelling before the wedding, but that's just common sense""

The Doctor came for her in a random night she wasn't expecting. His arrival wasn't planned. Rory would not make any assumptions because he wouldn't even know about it. It's a coincidence that the Doctor even appeared one day before Amy's wedding. With that in mind, my cold feet/escape commitment explanation could be utter crap. In which case, she just left with him because it's *him*. Her childhood idol, chance to travel the universe, and kind of now-sexy friend.

She didn't stop to consult Rory about travelling because that's the general idiocy of companions in general. Rose didn't think about it, Martha didn't think about it, only Donna planned because she happened to meet him ahead of time. The companions drop everything at that moment and join him. You could call them selfish for not considering their families. But none of them expected the Doctor to show up (except Donna).
Since she didn't expect his arrival, her leaving with him in 11th Hour wasn't ""wrong, deceitful, and immature"". There's nothing wrong with travelling with the Doctor (w/ infatuation), it wasn't deceitful because, just like Vampires of Venice, she didn't even have a *chance* or any time for deceit to brew, and it wasn't immature because travelling with someone you idolize and even like a bit more than you should in order to see the universe isn't immature.

It's also not ""insensitive, inconsiderate, rude"" because the Doctor told Amy that they could be back whenever. The fact that Amy checked with the Doctor shows that her wedding and Rory *did* factor into her considerations. Because they could be back whenever there was no chance of her missing the wedding (as far as the Doctor led her to believe).

Yes, Amy's decision to travel was a large factor of wanting to be in the Doctor's life. It wasn't sexual, it was infatuation as you say. I think that because of Amy's obsession (therapy), it should be understandable and excusable that the Doctor would be a large factor in why she'd want to travel with him. Childhood idol after all. And she didn't want him because she thought the Doctor was a better person than Rory was (heavens no), she wanted him because he seemed like a magical archetype, not a real person. She didn't want to have a long term relationship with the Doctor ever. So what she did wasn't wrong at all. There's nothing wrong with a woman having more than one man be a large part of her life so long as that other many isn't *romantically* involved (they never were, she was obsessed and it only reached a sexual point, sort of). Sure, I can see how that would easily make an ordinary guy jealous, but that doesn't make what she did wrong.
""especially in a time when you *really* needed her""

There was no special situation of dire need except for the wedding which Amy wasn't going to miss (accurate time machine).
Rory didn't need Amy in that way. There was no specific trying time he was going through. He didn't need her more intensely than usual. He wanted to settle down, she didn't. That's not the same kind of need, it's not ""I'm having major emotional trauma, I need you to comfort me"", it's a ""we need to make a decision about our relationship. I think we should settle down, this is very important to me"". And Amy's response is, ""Not yet, this is my only chance to see the universe. This is also important to me, travel with us and we’ll settle down later"" And Rory's essential response, ""Okay, but please, soon."" And they did get a house and settle (beginning of Impossible Astronaut). And as far as we know, they're going to settle for good in the next series.

So besides the fact that respect is not compliance, and besides the fact that Rory is okay with it, Amy does, in the end, comply. Which you cited earlier as what respect would be- if she had said, 'later'. And essentially that's what did happen. There was no disrespect here.
""comes back very late, but comes back""

This implies that Amy still expects him to save her or return for her. But if they were to settle down, that would be their final good-bye. They would be ""moving on"" as companions do in the show. Amy would get back to her life with Rory and the Doctor would probably be thinking ""another one has flown the nest"" (3rd Doctor &amp; Jo).

As for the God Complex, if that was the Doctor's final goodbye to them, then there you go, Amy settled down with Rory. It's the Doctor's fault she didn't know it was THE goodbye because he misled them. And since he comes back, it means that it's not THE goodbye, and Amy never knew it was, so from her POV, her choices make sense. She hadn't reached THE goodbye when her only chance to see the universe would end. So keep travelling while you can...you'll never get to after THE end.

The fact that Rory was willing to give up his want to settle down to make Amy happy with her travelling just means he loves her a lot. That doesn't mean Amy is a jerk. And if Rory did give Amy that ultimatum, she would definitely choose him. Just because she's callous and selfish doesn't mean she would give up the man she loved the most to keep travelling. It's emphasized that she is loyal to Rory in the end, when things get real (her speech in A Good Man Goes to War). Since Rory doesn't object, that makes what Amy did *okay*. It wasn't ""wrong"" or ""right"", those terms are moral absolutes. What she did was selfish, but if Rory was willing to accept her actions instead of break off their relationship, then it IS okay. He may not be happy with it, but it's okay. It would only *not* be okay if Rory decided that he'd had enough of her crap and gave her the ultimatum.

What's defined as ""okay"" is defined by Rory's willingness to accept it. With this definition, yes, it's okay. As for the moral absolutes of right and wrong, those are too black-and-white. One could argue it's *wrong* to be selfish, but I wouldn't go that far. I'd say it's not good to be selfish, but it's not some fundamental flaw in Amy's morality that makes her a bad character. At most, it makes her what we've always established: she's selfish. But Rory is okay with her selfishness (which is not the moral absolute wrong) so within the confines of Rory's willingness and their relationship, it IS okay.

Rory doesn't not slam his foot down because he's afraid of losing her, he doesn't slam his foot down because he knows that while the Doctor is not her romantic partner, he does mean a lot to Amy. Plus, he was hurt because he thought that Amy was talking about the Doctor being the center of her world (which was so boring till he dropped out of the sky). But Amy proves her loyalty- she was talking about Rory being the center of her life. Rory was hurting because he thought she truly loved the Doctor, not because Amy wanted to travel against his wishes.
Rory's not homophobic, but the audience could (and some inevitably would find it odd) see it that way. Our society's standards don't allow for Rory to keep looking at the Doctor, which isn't fair, but that's how it is. He didn't turn his back out of respect, but out of social convention.
It *was* a fling. This is a fundamental difference in opinion between us. Those weeks she spent with the Doctor weren't romantic or part of ""a long term fling"" imo. They don't count because she wasn't making advances or hinting at something more or any interest. Her first real pass at trying to get him interested IS those five minutes. Her infatuation was only minorly based on the sexual. It mostly stemmed from her obsession.

"c4atu5o","&gt; Besides the fact that your statement is way to general to be true (maybe it's my cynicism but that statement is risible). And when, in the western world of this reality, do time travelling aliens who were your childhood idol ever pop up and offer you the universe? This wouldn't be a problem if the Doctor was female. Right up until the 'getting into the pants' thing.

First, I meant that it's never okay for that to happen. That's not acceptable, that's not the standard, and it's a selfish and hurtful action that's wrong no matter what gender does it. This *would* be a problem, regardless of which gender the Doctor is, because it's running off with someone you are sexually attracted to and idolize to try and escape commitment.

&gt; Once again, you're equating running away with the Doctor as betrayal. Is it? Even when up until Angel/Forest's end she hadn't tried to get into his pants and did not plan to? (flirt yes)

Betrayal? No. I mean, Rory assumed she was not going to go time travelling before the wedding, but that's just common sense. She did, however, leave without leaving a note. If there's one thing I've learned from one-armed people it's that you *always* leave a note. 

All joking aside, she stole away in the night without telling him. Stealing off, might I remind you, with another guy whom she is *deeply* infatuated by. She did this with the specific intent of fleeing her responsibilities instead of at the very least talking to Rory about it. She makes a move to do something self-serving at the cost of what Rory trusted her to do. Remember again that all she knows about the TARDIS is that it rarely brings you on time, and even then she doesn't ask if she can be back in time until *after* she's already decided to go. As if this event (that's incredibly important to Rory) is an afterthought.

&gt; When the series first aired and she left in the Eleventh Hour, did you immediately think that what she was doing was some kind of cheat? And do you think that her traveling with him, when they had no romantic relationship, was Amy betraying Rory?

I'm not saying it's *cheating*. Wrong, deceitful, and immature, yes. Insensitive, inconsiderate, rude? Yes. But you can't really call it cheating at that point, because the whole sexual aspect hasn't *totally* come to a head (you're aware that it's there, but it's not at the forefront *yet*). I thought ""Wow, this girl is leaving with the Doctor on her wedding night. That's kind of insensitive to whoever she's marrying, I guess"", but it wasn't until you got to know Rory and realize that she treats him like this *all the time* and how incredibly sweet and kind he is to her that I realized how terribly inconsiderate that is. And she isn't even apologetic after the fact. I mean, if someone was planning on *maybe* missing *the wedding* I would expect at least the tiny bit of sheepishness form the fleeing culprit, but not even the slightest modicum of shame is spent from Amy.

But every depiction she had wasn't of the planets she'd see or the adventures she'd go on. It was all about *him*. It may not have started that way, but it quickly devolved into this obsessive fixation on him as an archetype. Think LINDA if they never moved on and did other things and LINDA is just one person.

Be it obsession or devotion, it was an *intense* attraction to the Doctor in a *profound* way. An infatuation so deep she needed *therapy*. She didn't just want him sexually (although it's obvious she'd harbored such thoughts since Eleventh Hour) she just *wanted him*. Wanted to be with him, wanted to just be a part of his life. That's the sort of feelings that might make an average man a little jealous, but Rory's got the patience of a turtle and is willing to put up with all of Amy's issues.

But the point is that for all intents and purposes she was infatuated with the Doctor and just wanted him so badly. That really, really hurts. The idea that there's another man your spouse rather be with than yourself, especially in a time when you *really* need her, is something that stings. Bad. Rory's made of *tough stuff* to handle that so level-headedly.

&gt; In regards to respect, I think that it's not as drastic as religion but more serious than making it to a 'choir practice'. 

To some people it's one event that makes the world of difference. To a child it's having a parent come to every ball-game or have a friend attend a birthday party, or in adulthood have a friends come support them at a family member's wake or help them move or attend their college graduation. All of those things are important moments in a relationship where you turn to someone and say ""I need you"". If there's a shared respect between the two of them this shouldn't even need be asked. That's just a relationship, be it family or friendship they work together to help each other out in times of need. Rory needed Amy. Amy went off to have fun with the Doctor. That's just really selfish and disrespectful.

&gt; The Doctor wouldn't come back for her, just like he doesn't come back for his other companions.

Amy has literally no idea of this. From what she's seen (and from what the Doctor tells her) he *always* comes back. Comes back very late, but comes back. 

&gt; Sure he dropped them off in God Complex, but that was a pit stop while he looked for their lost daughter, not good-bye for good.

He wasn't looking for their lost daughter at that point. He had caught up with River back in Let's Kill Hitler and from there knew that River was fine. He was saying goodbye because he thought he was going to die. Remember that the next episode is him revisiting Craig and saying goodbye to him, as he's on a ""farewell tour"". He meant that as a goodbye. He also comes back for them. Make of that what you will.

&gt; This travelling was important to Amy just as much, if not more, than how important settling down was to Rory. Except that apparently it wasn't as important to Rory because he didn't give her an ultimatum and say ""if you can't settle down with me this relationship won't work."" Since it didn't come to that, things stayed as they were and that makes it fine. It was selfish, but it did no harm.

It was important to Rory. It states often that this is how he's always wanted to live his life. He just cares about Amy so much and is so scared of losing her that he'd never offer her an ultimatum, because she'd be liable to take it. You *presume* that since Rory doesn't object it must be alright, but if you honestly believe that you're not understanding what kind of a man Rory is.

He's the man who will take ridicule for being a nurse because he wants to help people. He's the man who would look past all of Amy's psychotic obsession with the Doctor because he loves her. He's the man who will always back down when it's him at stake, but will *never* back down if it's someone else. 

That's who he is. He's not going to give ultimatums when he could just bend to Amy's will. He's the sort of man who will do things he hates for someone he loves. That's Rory.

Rory feels all of this pain, and he shows it. Did you not see the look on his face when Amy cried out for the Doctor over the tracking implant? He feels every sting she deals to him with her thoughtlessness, but he trudges on with a stiff upper lip, because he loves her. He feels just as badly as I do, but he's not the sort of man to slam his foot down like that against her, because he's too afraid of losing her.

&gt; To note, Rory wasn't respecting the Doctor by looking away, he's straight, he has no interest in watching the Doctor. And if he did watch (with or without disinterest) he could be accused of being gay, and heaven forbid someone is gay in our society...

You're presuming Rory's homophobic, or that he's afraid of being called gay. He's a *nurse*, an occupation often associated with women. He's secure in his sexuality, but he is very polite and respectful of other people.

&gt; I agree with you that Amy's sexual attraction contributed to her decision to travel with the Doctor, but as you said yourself, it wasn't a huge factor. And as you also said yourself, if you were in her position (childhood friend and the universe) you'd jump at the chance. So even without the sexual factor, she would've gone. And as I said above (and many posts ago) it was a fling, not a long term relationship. (You also said you'd forgive the fling, about 2 or 3 posts ago).

This *wasn't* a fling. This was *weeks* of her life spent with someone she was *intensely* infatuated with. If it was *Actually* five minutes and *only* five minutes, it's forgivable. But it wasn't. 

It was her, running off. Sorry, *running away*. Away from Rory without telling him. 

&gt; Also your description of Amy's pass at the Doctor as an ""attempted rape"" is something I find personally insulting. Rape is serious and what she did was nowhere close to what rape is.

*Attempted* rape is when one member attempts to have sexual intercourse with a non-consenting partner. That's the legal definition. The Doctor didn't give consent. In fact, he straight-up said no. And yet she threw him around and tried to have sex with him. I don't care how mild you think that is. It is *definitionally* attempted rape. I understand there are cases that are more severe than this one, but that does not magically make this not attempted rape. It was.

And there's one note I made that you seem to have skipped: Amy never apologized for this. She never even confessed to Rory she *had* a fling. *THAT'S* what I'm talking about. The lying, the deceit, the hiding the truth. Be it leaving with the doctor or hiding that she tried to bone him, she obfuscates and tries to keep Rory in the dark.

"c44zmsw","I completely understand where you are coming from and this conversation falls in the whole ""medical tourism"" debate. 

Personally, I volunteered in a hospital abroad prior to med school with zero medical experience to bring to the table. Why? because I had an interest in international medicine and wanted to have a little glimpse as to what it entailed. Over there, I learned how to performed a few procedures, such as venipunctures and sutures. I was treated like a local nursing student and followed the same training, so I don't think the patients had a higher risk of complication than normal.

Did I make a difference volunteering there? Absolutely not. Could the money spent on the trip be put to better use? Undoubtedly. And the skills I picked up over there, I will learn to do it over here.

But what I gained from the trip is a better understanding of how other parts of the world work, some of the obstacles they are facing, and a passion for international medicine. Now back stateside, I am using that knowledge and the connections I made oversea to come up with a way to give back by providing sustainable solutions to some of the issues I witnessed oversea.

"c3vrj4c","&gt;They're not even testing rich people--they're taking random people and telling them to pretend to be rich and them asking them to act they way they think rich people act.

That's actually what makes the study valid.  It means it's not something genetic that makes rich people more selfish, but it's mental, cultural, and we can program anyone to be more greedy and selfish by simply suggesting to them they are rich.

In a way this slightly exonerates the rich, because part of the blame can now be laid on the circumstance and not on their internal factors.

The actual rich would never show up for a study like this, so how would you study it?  And if they did show up, they'd realize what was being tested and they'd easily adjust their behavior (unless their name is Mitt Romney) to produce a bullshit result.

I've read other similar studies.  For example, in Freakanomics, there is an experiment with bagels.  A guy would leave a box of bagels and a collection box for money.  It was an honor system.  You take a bagel and drop a buck (or whatever) in the box.  What he found was that the floors with the executives consistently yielded less revenue (ie, people took bagels without dropping a buck more often).  He also found that people were generally remarkably honest on the whole.  There was a slight difference in honesty between the rich floors and the poor floors.  The rich were a bit less honest.

So it's not just this one researcher who is finding this.  Many researchers have conducted similar experiments and it seems universally they find this result: the rich are more self-centered.

"c3pvuxs","Not at all. The first few episodes were similar, but the books are wildly different. Damon is more stand-offish and defensive than truly a bad person, Elena starts out shallow and selfish but grows into an empathetic young woman who actually learns from her mistakes, and Stefan never had the tragic, fucked-up past he did in the show. And Klaus was just this evil old vampire, Tyler was a dick-possible-rapist, Caroline was just a wicked, self-absorbed little cunt, Bonnie is this tiny dreamy-eyed redhead and of druid bloodlines (as opposed to Salem witches), and Meredith was this quiet, grounded friend who often spoke the voice of reason.

They're incredibly different. Katherine is actually certifiably batshit insane, too. And Elena is a lot more empathetic and less judgmental; the original trilogy ended with her asking Stefan to look after Damon, because she understood that her not being around would leave Damon with no one but his brother to understand him.

I love both in their own right, even if the books are dated and simplistic (teen novels had drastically different standards back in the day), but right now book!Elena is a lot easier to relate to than show!Elena. Though, in some ways, most of the other characters are better fleshed out in the show.

I've stood by Elena, reminded myself she's still just a teenager and has a lot of problems, but this last episode really just hit home, for me, that she's actually a stubbornly STUPID teenager. Even with external help, rebuke, and aid, she doesn't ever seem to learn from her mistakes. Yes, Damon did wrong, yes, Stefan did wrong... so why is she not learning from that and distancing herself from both of them instead of latching on to whoever is pleasing her most at any given turn in the plot?

"c3ha4zd","'Sara' (since it's popular in this post) was my baby daughter's godmother. She was a somewhat irresponsible and selfish, but had been my best friend for years, so I was able to look past all that. We had similar taste in guys, and jealousy (on her behalf) was a common factor in our friendship.

I was not satisfied in my relationship with the baby's father, so I ended up moving into her place for a couple months. She couldn't understand why I would leave him, and perpetually suggested I get back together with him. Not long after, the father and I started dating again to try and refuel the relationship. And it was working. I moved out of her place, and in a few doors down with his mother, who was available to babysit while I worked. 

I was tired and stressed out from work/baby/dating and stopped going out with 'the gang' as often. One day, a friend/coworker asked what was wrong, since I looked miserable. I can't remember what I said, but it caused her to look at me with pity and say ""Oh my god, you know"". So, I started questioning her about what she meant by that but she avoided the questions and ran off to work. I had suspicions.

So, I asked the father. He said that one night Sara was at the bar, and she had been hitting on him heavily all night long. While believable, I was still suspicious. So, I started calling everybody I knew who may be involved. With a little detective work, I found out who was at the bar that night (father and his friend, Sara and our friend, 'Donna'). I called and left messages, especially for Donna. I'd call her up to 4 times a day, and ask her to call me back, because I just wanted to know what exactly went down that night. I was open about what I wanted to know and why because I wanted people to have to either outright lie to me or tell me the truth. People will usually keep a secret for others by avoiding conversations, but they hate having to tell a bold-faced lie.

One day after a particularly long message, she called me back. She felt bad, and that I deserved to know. She told me that she had hooked up with the father's friend that night, and that Sara had hooked up with the father. The morning after when he stopped by early and unannounced to pick up the baby? .. It was because he had spent the night a few doors down, screwing my best friend.

Well, I flew off the handle and confronted her in front all of our friends, and she confessed everything. They slept together twice, two weeks apart. She told me all this not because she felt guilty, but because she figured she could make me more mad at him than at her. I listened, got all the information from her, and never spoke to her/saw her again.

One day, as I'm getting ready to leave work, her boyfriend (did I mention she had a long-term boyfriend?) came in, and asked me if I wanted a ride home. We got in the car, and he asked me why I don't talk to her anymore. And that's when I realized. He had the same suspicions I did, and was taking the same route to find the answers. Asking.

No fucking way was I not going to tell him. I told him about the baby's father, the guy he had met a couple months ago whom she had said was my hook-up but was actually hers (the two of them actually knew each other!), a bunch of gross guys from the bar, a friend or two of his, and all about the crap she says about him behind his back, such as he's abusive and stalking her.

He never spoke to her again either. I got one very pissed off message from her asking why I would do that to her. lol Stupid bitch.

On a side note: She talked crap about me behind my back. She left the baby unattended while babysitting (Went to the store for a half hour, left baby alone). While living at her house, I once found a piece of glass under my pillow, and shrugged it off only to find a smaller piece in my contact lens holder (Can't prove anything, but instinct is enough for me). 

It wasn't until I started post-secondary education that I realized that she has untreated borderline personality disorder. I haven't shared even a smidgen of the full Sara story, but she's a textbook example. When working in mental health, I was able to point out the patients who would later be diagnosed with it, without fail, after talking to them for a just a short time. Because of her.

tl;dr - Best friend/godmother sleeps with father of my baby, on two different occasions.

"c3h25z8","&gt;He's not a five year old who should be told what to do and what you want

The context of what you said here will also lead you to more confusion of understanding the opposite gender.  As a man, you grow up and are raised to take care of yourself.  You want something, you go get it; don't expect anyone to get it for your.  You're uncomfortable, you fix it; don't expect anyone to do it for you.  You have a problem, fix it; you are expected to to take care of yourself.  If you need help, ask; don't expect anyone to just know what you need.  You are expected to take care of all your needs, even emotional ones.  This is ingrained in you, taught in you, beat into you, it's a habit you've lived with all of your life.  So, it is understandable for a man not to quite understand what a woman needs, because a lot of times he puts himself in her shoes thinking, ignorantly, that she has everything she needs, otherwise she would say something or take care of it herself.  One time, when I was younger, at a buffet, I sat down next to my ex to dig into my plate.  She was pissed because, even though she already got her plate of food, I didn't think to get enough napkins for both of us.  I just got enough for me.  Mentally, I said to myself, oh I get it, she wants someone who doesn't just think of himself, but thinks of her too.  I was disappointed in her too, because, instead of just being pissed at me, why didn't she take the time to understand where I'm coming from?  Why do I have to be the one to always figure her out, but she doesn't feel the need to do the same in return?  If she did take the time to figure me out, she would probably discover that I'm not so much selfish but ignorant.  She may discover: if I sat down next to a male friend, I would have told him he was out of line to get upset with me for not bringing enough napkins.  He's expected to take care of himself.  If I was the one who forgot to get napkins I would do one of two things, asked him for some of his or get off my butt and get my own.

"c3gskl4","It's a major indication of youth to feel this way. It really is. I hate to condescend in this manner but you're going to learn this soon. You may not be super close to your family but I can reassure you something, family is a supreme priority when faced with a significant other that you're not married to in your 20s.

I'll tell you one of my life's biggest regrets. I have lots of uncles and aunts I was close to throughout my childhood and adolescence. I hit 20 and decided the most important thing in my life was love. Love was everything. I sacrificed everything for love. It burned me. An uncle who was a father figure to me passed away while I was gone and to this day I regret it. And in the end the love I chased wasn't the love I thought it was.

"c3b8koe","&gt;You cannot say ""well since the least intelligent of our species wouldn't grasp this we should abandon it due to it's impracticality."". It's an objection from ignorance and not valid.

I hope you had a Merry Christmas!  Or whatever it is you celebrate...  I had a good Christmas.  Anyways, when I made that statement that was a pragmatic (and apparently utilitarian) dismissal of the issue, I was saying that we should *disregard* the general population to analyze it further, because the situation does not apply to them.  I admitted that it was a partial objection, then went on to talk about arguments that dealt directly with the question at hand because I too was unsatisfied with that response...

And, yes I am definitely not attacking the validity of your argument, I simply believe there are some flawed premises involved.

&gt;By forcing someone to avoid suicide you do stand things to gain.

Agreed. The point that I was trying to make, albeit I may not have articulated well, is that I do not believe that forcing your ideals on someone is *necessarily* done for personal gain.  **It is not a selfish act by nature, it only has a strong disposition towards being a selfish thing**.  That is my belief, and probably the core premise which I find myself having trouble with here.

Another is this one:  

&gt;It is meta-selfish. It is 1 degree higher than simply acting on your own needs with disregard for others...

To me, something meta-selfish, would be a selfish act regarding selfishness itself, and I cannot think of an example which actually suits this, so I'll use the example of meta-desires to illustrate.  A meta-desire, would be a desire which regards another desire:  ""I want to not want to smoke a cigarette""  My desire to not desire cigarettes is a meta-desire.  A desire which regards another desire could be said to be 1 degree higher.

In other words, nothing inside of **forcing my subjective world-view upon another** references selfishness itself on a ""meta"" level.  If anything, it is simply another selfish act where you're being a bit more of a prick.  Most selfish acts affect other people's livelihoods on some level anyways though, so the distinction is also grey on some level.

Instead, it is not *meta-selfish*, but rather, a selfish act which also strips *personal liberty* from the other party.  Assuming that personal liberty is a fundamental right, or natural law, we could make this selfish act *one degree worse than the other*, on the grounds that it is both selfish and it infringes upon our fundamental law.

I feel that I am not misinterpreting your claims, but rather, I am disagreeing with some assumptions.  I will admit, my disagreement with **forcing subjective world-view on another** is weak.  However, I simply wonder what qualifies as an unselfish act, and why this act is always selfish regardless of circumstance.  I don't believe that you have sufficiently shown to me why this act is always selfish and never unselfish *by definition*.  If you feel you have laid out a good argument here so far, speak no more to it, I do not place the burden of proof on you here, but rather, it's ambiguous.  Intuition certainly does place it as egocentric, which is connected with selfishness, but in the end I may be tailoring selfishness to not include egocentrism while you would say that it does.  Anyways, the following is more pressing:

My disagreement with meta-selfishness I have laid out as best I can, and there, I feel, the burden of proof still lies with you.  Given that we accept that **forcing subjective world-view on another** is selfish by definition, we still find the issue of qualifying one act as *necessarily* more selfish.  In my opinion, you are relying on subjectively placing 'infringing on personal liberty' as a sacred rule which, when broken, makes an act as more selfish.",1324883749,"i don't believe that you have sufficiently shown to me why this act is always selfish and never unselfish *by definition*.","selfish and never","selfish",NA,FALSE,"always selfish and never unselfish","unselfish","always","never",1

Kelly's gobsmacked, and starts telling him that he doesn't understand, it's a mandatory appearance, she could go to jail, he HAS to give her a ride. Mark says no. She keeps telling him that he HAS to, he keeps saying no, and eventually she finds a friend who can get her there in the nick of time.

You completely missed the point and you're entrenched in refusing to understand the Korean viewpoint.

No foreigner prior to Naniwa has ever experienced this sort of drama from Koreans before, not even Idra. How could they anticipate this if it was something considered so culturally insulting to them that they couldn't conceive of it happening?

Should the MLG inform everyone that it's culturally unacceptable for fans to fart on pros during autograph sessions? Take off your blinders for once. You are getting this wrong because you are assuming it's a **moral** issue. It is not. No one is ""right"" or ""wrong"", but this is an insult to Koreans on Korean turf. And it isn't just a light one.

&gt; If Gom wants foreign players they should prepare for foreign players. The foreign scene is definitely an important part of their business plan or they wouldn't be working so have people like Idra, Huk, Tastosis, Rotterdam and the other English casters.

Like how? Anticipating that a kid would act like a total asshole in game? You may not think he was acting that way not only from a Western viewpoint but as someone who doesn't have to put up with his shit. He has a history of terrible manners. It's easy for someone to talk about forgiving Naniwa so blithely and portraying the Koreans as assholes, but have you ever had to deal with Naniwa? Were you ever a ref? Were you ever on the receiving end of his rage?

&gt; Naniwa isn't being held responsible for his actions. He stole a piece of candy and had his hand chopped off for it. That's not being held responsible. That's not justice. At least, had he known that stealing the piece of candy would mean his hand getting chopped off, he probably wouldn't have done it.

This is not a ""piece of candy"". Honestly, I expected his punishment to be much worse. He's being treated with kid gloves right now because GOM is trying to be understanding that he's a foreigner. Like Huk said, if Naniwa was Korean and played for a Korean team, he'd practically be crucified. GOM is incredibly merciful by Korean standards.

Try to see the Korean mindset. Naniwa **IS NOT** an individual to them. He flagrantly insulted one of the best and highly respected players in the world on live broadcast. He disrespected Nestea, he disrespected himself, he disrespected his fans, he disrespected his sponsors and he disrespected his team. There is no ""I"" here.

When you look at the Coca incident on paper, it's not that terrible. I mean shit, they're just kids, right? Wrong. There are several reasons to why SlayerS took action before GOM and why they were punished so harshly:

* There is a hierarchy of responsibility. Coca and Byun are team SlayerS members first, and Coca and Byun second. If the SlayerS team didn't take direct ownership and action over this incident first, then the entire team would have lost face.

* In the Korean view, it's not Coca and Byun may have messed up, but SlayerS messed up even more for not teaching them better.

This drama boils down into two things:

* Foreigners going: ""Naniwa is an INDIVIDUAL! He doesn't represent his sponsors/team/fans/the league! It's illogical to punish him because he broke no rules!""

* Koreans going: ""Naniwa represents ALL OF US! What kind of idiot doesn't have the decent manners and respect that all pro gamers are expected to have? Even Idra knows the importance of respecting someone like Nestea!""

**NEITHER SIDE IS CORRECT**. When you say, ""The Koreans are being way too harsh"" what you're basically saying is ""Your culture is stupid and wrong! Become like us!"" When Koreans say, ""These foreigners have absolutely no respect"" what they're basically saying is, ""Your culture is stupid and wrong!""

Don't you see? This idiotic commitment to staying belligerent about your Western worldview is only going to create more conflict. I understand that it's difficult for both parties because frankly neither are used to doing it. Seriously, I really wish there were a lot more prominent foreign-born Koreans on the scene, because we are eminently fucking qualified in navigating between two cultures, understanding both views and seeing how awful things get when neither side tries to ""get it"".

&gt; And as for the streets of Korea not being dirty? Are you fucking kidding me? They're plenty dirty. Plenty. But then the hajjumas walk around and pick it all up at night. Have you ever been to Haeundae beach in Busan at 4 a.m. on a Saturday morning? It's filthy and a team of hajjumas clean it all up. Korea has their own shit, too. They just have all the power in this scenario.

I think you mean 아줌마s, or ""ahjumas"". I never said Korea doesn't have its own shit, but on the whole, Korean streets and buildings are much cleaner than American cities. Japanese are by far the cleanest.

I've never been to Haeundae, but I assume it's dirty because teenagers and hooligans throw their trash there all the time.

The difference is cultural expectation. In Korea and Japan you are **expected** to clean up after yourself because it is communal. In the West, it's generally assumed that people will not because, because the cultures are largely individualistic. By the way, this is not a racial thing. It's a cultural thing. You can be white but still come from a very communal culture because you're Albanian.

I am **not** saying one culture is better than the other. Individualistic cultures have people who are more selfish but receptive to difference. You can do what you want, believe what you want and live how you want. Communal cultures have people who are more sacrificial but are not so receptive to difference. You do what the group wants, you believe what the group believes and you live how the group lives.

"c312x7p","I think it took about 10 weeks before we tried to have sex, even though I was physically good to go at 6 weeks.  Breastfeeding really saps the sexy feelings, especially if breast-play is a usual part of your sex life.  I couldn't stand it! It felt weird, made me leak milk.  It took a few month and more sleep to get more frequent and normal again.

On top of that, cuddling with a fussy infant all day was really physically exhausting, in terms of being touched. I just did not want to be touched any more. I needed hugs, more than anything. A sympathetic ear and shoulder to cry on when I felt overwhelmed. 

I was also incredibly tired because I was the one up for the night feedings.  I was able to pump, so I got some feedings off in the beginning- before she stopped taking bottles. Since I often woke up anyway, it was simpler to latch her than get my husband to go make a bottle, while listening to her scream the whole time.

"c310916","My brother. He was always strange, ever since he was young. Threw the worst temper tantrums imaginable, and generally made it hell whenever he didn't get his way. All my childhood he was a bully toward me and was always manipulative and selfish. I can't remember a single time he ever did anything that wasn't to his own benefit. 

Once he got to college he managed to get a girlfriend in his grasp and is incredibly abusive toward her (they have been together about 6 years now). I know by statements from my brother himself and by those around him that he pressured her into having sex when she didn't want to during the beginning of their relationship (in his own words he ""wore her down eventually""). He constantly belittles her, shouts at her, and orders her around. She cooks for him all the time and if she cooks something not to his satisfaction, he will send her back to the kitchen to fix it. Now I understand that this in of itself isn't indicative of an evil person but he (and he stated this himself, bragging about it) likes to do an intruder roleplay with his girlfriend where he acts like an intruder breaking into her home and forcing himself upon her sexually (like some kind of rape scenario). The first time they did this (and he said this himself) he put a pillow over her face, and she got scared and started freaking out and screaming. Her entire personality has been consumed by him. She no longer has her own interests, opinions or even friends because he has isolated her from all of them. He has even isolated her from her own family. 

Because of his treatment of his girlfriend we (as in myself and my parents) do not get along with them. My brother, because of that, decided to stop speaking to us. He told us not to come to his graduation. He refuses to acknowledge his relation to my parents. And yet, he continues to have his girlfriend send us nasty emails from time to time about how abusive WE are. Talk about irony. He honestly just doesn't care about hurting our parents. He has no interest, and never has really, in interacting with the rest of the family. They never even disagreed with him or got involved yet he doesn't contact him (and yet in his emails he complains of being ostracized from the family). The only relatives he contacts are my father's grandparents who-- you guessed it-- happen to be a little wealthy and very generous with their money. Go figure. 

With myself as a witness considering I'm his sister, he was raised by good parents. No abuse or anything. He is just like that-- evil, inherently. 

EDIT: Kind of wrote this in a rush of emotion, so sorry about any typos or if some of my sentences are jumbled. This is a saga that has been going on my whole life so it was difficult to condense it into a few paragraphs.

TL;DR: My brother is  sociopath who grew up mistreating and manipulating myself and my parents, and now psychologically (and possibly physically, sexually) abuses his girlfriend and has taken over her life entirely.

"c30gogb","I read the books before the show was ever scripted, so maybe I can offer some insight to the original appeal of the first 3-4 novels (I won't lie, I love L.J. Smith, but her latest works are... strange).

The idea behind the original TVD novels were to introduce a popular girl, a girl who has everything handed to her in life, a girl who takes her friends for granted... and a girl who has that ripped out from beneath her. As you continue the series, you find that Elena is gradually learning what it means to love your friends and family; she learns the penalties of being selfish and just how much you have to be willing to risk in order to sacrifice yourself. It's more about the journey to becoming an independent, selfless person than about love and vampires (though, yes, those are heavy presences).

The new trilogy just got weird. L.J. Smith vanished off the face of the planet for a decade, and with her public disappearance went her writing. She did not write at all for years, due to family deaths, troubles, divorces, and housing issues. During that time she watched A LOT of anime, and it shows pretty painfully--she tries to turn what was, to me, a bittersweet story of a girl and her friends learning to join forces to fight against the supernatural terror falling upon Fell's Church, into a magical girl anime with grotesque horror. It's not a pretty picture.

In a lot of ways, I love the original novels, mostly because of Damon. He gave every appearance of being arrogant and selfish, but when push came to shove he actually proved to be incredibly gentle and caring in his own way. Elena actually developed over time, like a real person. Bonnie was less insufferable. Meredith existed. Stefan... well, I love the show's Stefan better nowadays.

TVD is not one of her better works of the past. To get a true feel for L.J. Smith, you'd want to read the Dark Visions trilogy, or Forbidden Game, or the Night World series (namely Daughters of Darkness, The Chosen, and Soulmate--I feel those were the best written with the best characters, and the series is unique in that each novel follows a different set of people that slowly come together in a novel that... well, I'm sitting on 12 years waiting for it, now).

As for penguin dimorphism, do any search for a species and you'll get information on it. Birds do not have external genetalia, so without other dimorphic characteristics such as feather coloration, crests, or size, it's not possible to identify whether a bird is male or female. Here, I'll even be nice and link you to a [page](http://www.seaworld.org/animal-info/info-books/penguin/physical-characteristics.htm), all you have to do is ctrl-F for ""dimorphism"". 

Also, do you honestly want to live in a world where there is no nature because humans decided ""well, fuck it, we have technology now!""? Not only is this extremely selfish, but extremely naive. As I said, every animal fills a niche. Without this niche, the ecosystem is destroyed. 

For example: 

* penguin eats fish
* if there are no penguins, the fish become overpopulated
* if they overpopulate, there will be no plants or plankton that the fish eat
* if there are none of those, the bacteria die off
* if the bacteria dies off, structures like reefs as well as tons of other species die off
* then there is nothing to protect the ocean floor from weathering, which causes the entire area to be transformed, and can result in the destruction of nearby land areas, or worse, changes in currents 
* changes in currents affect the temperature of the oceans' water, transversely the temperature in the atmosphere
* atmospheric changes affect the climate, and result in storms and other catastrophes during the change
* need I go on? 

I hope you can take it from here to realize that the more things that die and the more we screw up our ecosystems, the closer we bring ourselves to our own unavoidable destruction. I'm not exaggerating for effect, either.

"c2w0706","""SHOULD"" and ""MUST"" are different concepts.  Duty implies necessity - that one must act in a certain way.  Should implies ought to but does not have to.  That is the distinction.  

We do not have a duty.  If there is an injured person in an emergency you should help them, but it is not immoral to value your life more and not endanger your own life if you choose not to.  The example you gave is so stretched that it suggests that in an extraordinary circumstance of danger to one individual you shouldn't bother to dial a phone.  That is not selfish, but callous and cruel.  

Now, if you want to understand why an emergency is different from a non-emergency it is as follows.  In a non-emergency an individual has the ability to use their mind and act in a rational way with others, trading value for value.  But in an emergency this is not the case, and you help the individual out of your goodwill and benefit of the doubt that it is a good person who is in need.   If you see your mortal enemy in an emergency, you do not help him.  

Looking for a boolean approach to borderline cases is also mistaken.  Objectivist ethics has clear principles, derived from metaphysics, epistemology and the insight that life is the standard of value.   Like science, there are borderline cases where small changes in one variable can lead to different outcomes.  In your example, if the girl at the door had said that the murderer said he would kill anyone who tried to help her, the choice would be a more difficult one.  If the girl was someone the helper knew well and cared for the choice would be overwhelmingly in favour of helping her, whereas if she was someone who had falsely accused the helper of rape the choice would be to send her away without help.  So all the factors need to be considered, and unlike science, which deals with precise quantities, ethics does not.  You can have 6 million atoms, you can't have 6 million units of love and 2 million units of danger.  So precision in measurement in ethics is not the same as science.  There is more and less, little and a lot and those kinds of objective, but not quantitative measurements one considers in making moral choices.

You asked which is more selfish, but the answer is both - the need to be loved and the need to end one's own suffering. They're both selfish and entirely understandable feelings.

It's merely a fantasy to believe that you are an island of one and that your life belongs only to yourself.

As to why its important to me?  I recently lost my mother (not to suicide as far as I know, but I wouldn't put it past her) and she and I fought depression for many years.  And now one of my closest friends was just diagnosed with brain cancer.  Additionally, I work for a large non-profit that has a motto along the lines of ""Every life has equal worth"".  The idea to me that any life is worthless?  That someone could ever be in a situation where they would never again contribute to the world, to those around them?  To me, that's just not possible.

Thats your choice, but I hope people recognize what they're going to miss in their lifetime.  And to call that choice anything BUT a selfish decision?  I don't understand that either.

=========================
Why I believe its selfish

As you've said, 

&gt; a lot depends on how you define ""selfish"".

And really, it may depend on your point of view more than your definition of selfish.

And maybe we're all using the wrong word because I agree with you that when someone is suicidal, they view themselves as a drain.  Someone else said ""If I weren't here you wouldn't have to waste lunch"" as a comment a friend made before they committed suicide.  I think we agree that when you're suicidal, in your state of mind you do not see it as selfish, but selfless.

But ultimately, I argue that there is no ""selfless"" act.  Nothing we ever do is without some level of gain for us.  And ultimately that includes suicide.

When suicidal, a number of things are happening (Note, this is solely from my own experience with my own attempted suicide and from close friends who also deal with depression).  The two most important are the fact that you've determined that life is not going to get better.  That you cannot get out of whatever you're in.  And secondly is that nobody cares about you, nobody supports you and thats part of the fact you can't get out of it.  You don't have the energy and no one is giving you the support you need.

So, when you make the choice to end it all.  You do it for your own escape.  Because you don't see any point going further you'd rather take your chances with what is beyond than face another second in your tortured existence.  That ultimately is selfish.



I am very interested in your thoughts on this as you clearly have some well thought out points and more experience with it than I do.

Moral philosophers aside, I honestly think it depends on your own beliefs - if you believe that we are here for a purpose, then killing yourself is going against the purpose of our life. If you believe life is precious and that it is morally wrong to kill someone in all cases, then suicide would be no exemption. Some argue that it is selfish to kill yourself because the small benefit that it brings to yourself is so little in comparison to the misfortune that it will bring to friends, family, and the like.

I personally believe that we all have our respective purposes.

"c2sanew","&gt; I'd like to address this. If He is able to stop suffering but doesn't it does not automatically make Him not benevolent. We must consider intention and purpose. Why isn't He stopping the suffering? I will use the all too common example of a parent and child. A child will ask for candy at every meal and a bad parent will give them what they ask for because it's delicious and what they want but a good parent will give them bread, water, and beans because that is what will nourish them and will give them the foul tasting medicine even though it makes the child cry because that is what will help them. God allows suffering, yes, but any example you can give me of a ""good"" person will also allow suffering if it does good. God is the same. God allows suffering that ultimately leads to good. We cannot see this greater plan any more than you can explain to a child why it can't have candy in any way that will make sense to that child.

Are you really comparing the slaughter of millions, imprisonment, torture, rape, and holocaust to a child wanting candy for dinner? Really? The amount of suffering that exists on this planet at every moment of every day is something you see as part of the plans of a loving god?

Okay, lets run with that. The god of the bible, all-powerful, all-knowing, and all-loving; has created a world filled with immense suffering. In order for one creature to survive, it must end the life of another, this is a world filled with endless misery, constant hazard, infinite death. But even death and mortal suffering are not enough, so this same loving god also makes a hell for the immortal soul to dwell in eternal punishment.

If all of this awfulness was only made possible by your supposedly loving god, then I must ask: How can killing a child to avoid all of this be bad?

If this god is able to prevent a child from going to hell through the murderous actions of a priest, who are you to say that this too is not part of your god's great plan? If you justify all of the aforementioned suffering as being part of god's mysterious goodwill toward man, then couldn't the drowning of innocent children also be in accordance with this great plan?

As for that ""Orphantillect"" argument, I think you are missing the point, or have chosen a counter-argument to somebody else's ideas. I don't find the god of the bible to worthy of worship specifically because of the issues which I have outlined. I've read the bible (KJV) twice in the last ten years, and reject it as a narrative from a superior being. That being said I wonder why so many people find biblical morality appealing, especially when these kinds of scenarios (the one which I've outlined in the hypothetical of a priest drowning children in order to expedite their entry into heaven and avoid hell) are only made possible by the poorly designed rules of a supposedly all-powerful, all-knowing, and all-loving creator god.

There are plenty of reasons why it is repugnant for one human being to kill another human being. But fearing the retribution of an ancient god from a centuries-old text just isn't one of them.

What I want to know is why it is that anyone could examine the biblical values regarding an afterlife, and if they honestly believe it, how can they not want to kill their offspring?

If you really believe that there is a hell and a heaven, you have a moral duty to ensure as many of your fellow humans make it into heaven. No cost can be too great, and to do any less is not only selfish, but incredibly irresponsible.

&gt; Whatever eternal good you think you are doing for them is surpassed by the indignities you impose upon them.

This seems like a giant copout to me. I was not the one who insisted upon a binary outcome in death. I bet if every living person's fate is to either burn in torment of hell or rejoice in the love and happiness of heaven, then there is no cost too great to insure that every child ends up in the latter category. There is absolutely no price a loving parent would not pay or personally endure to insure their child does not end up eternally tortured.

&gt; P.S. Satan isn't a god. He is as much a creature as we are, as limited.

Okay, so I'm confused. If Satan is the cause of evil, but is not a god, then that means that the god of the bible created Satan as well? So then the god of the bible cannot be all-good since he created evil.

&gt; P.P.S. The Epicurius[sic] Argument is childish, overly simplistic, and flawed. You won't get very far with that.


So you claim the Paradox of Epicurus (trilemma) is ""childish, overly simplistic, and flawed""? Great.

I want straight answers:

Does the god of the bible send Christian children who are murdered to heaven?

Yes or no? 

Does the god of the bible know that the priest is going to murder Christian children?

Yes or no?

Does the god of the bible want Christian children to be murdered?

Yes or no?

If the trilemma is overly simplistic then you'll have no trouble at all dismantling it. Given a case where a priest kills children to ensure  they get into heaven, there are only two possible outcomes:

1 - The child goes to heaven

2 - The child goes to hell

In the case of number one, indeed the god of the bible is a loving god, the child is after all, innocent.

If outcome number one is true, then the priest has done the greater good. Even if the priest personally endures the wrath of god and burns forever in hell, the priest has undoubtedly spared the souls of children that would have otherwise burned in hell also.

If this was not the will of god, and this god did not intervene, it can only be because this god was unaware, unable, or unwilling to stop it. If this god was unwilling, then he is cruel, but not so cruel as to send a child to hell. This god's idea of justice is to allow children to be drowned, punish the murderer, and then the child spends eternity in heaven. If this is the case, then this god has created a scenario where killing lots of children has a net-positive outcome. Even if only 1% ever go to hell, the priest would simply need to kill hundreds of children in order to insure he rescued the few who were hell-bound. If this god was unable to prevent it, then he is not all-powerful. If this god did not know that the priest would kill the children, then he is not all-knowing. If you are suggesting that all of these things are somehow part of a thoughtful design, then it is obvious that the god of the bible is unimaginative and incompetent.

Outcome number two is more obvious. The god of the bible doesn't care that the child was murdered and sends it to hell anyways. This god is a cruel god that doesn't love or forgive. It is a god that sends murder victims to a much worse place when they die. It is a god that wills children to be tortured forever. Unless of course you want to argue that this god is powerless to prevent this, in which case it is an impotent helpless god (one I would not consider worthy of praise).

So what attribute does the god of the bible lack, and why despite this shortcoming is it important to forsake all other gods and worship only this one?

"c2pgyqb","I think it was a combination of things, yes, including Murphy's law. The biggest reason the Heat lost is a lack of syncopation. That much ego on one team takes more than a season to marinate into a ringer. Dallas was older and had more time together to get to know eachother's playstyle.

 As for Murphy's law, that's just logic. Take three crazy good players and put them on a team together, then tell them all year that they are going to win the championship. If you think about it like an Aesop's fable, the only possible outcome is for them to get there and lose. I think it says a lot about this situation that he got to the championship in his first season on the Heat. It helps justify his decision some. Now if he spends a few more years surrounded by that amount of ability and doesn't get a ring, that is, his decision to leave yields no rewards, then my argument is wrong and Lebron moved for nothing.

"c2o0xlf","To me, this ""picture"" carries an important subtext: 

Every citizen in a country carries a responsibility for their state and government. This carries over to business because if there were a harder demand for government control/influence over the private sector then there would be. In a Country (like the US) where nowhere near all of its citizens votes, that burden of responsibility is more clear, since the government and big business can keep doing whatever without anyone taking issue with it. Indeed, the person who does not vote and yet has the audacity to blame someone else for their problems is not only selfish but also stupid.

Now, having said that there are of course many, many people living in the US that have done what they can, or at least more than their neighbours and they ought to be proud, but of course not satisfied. So start a movement. Blaming the system for being corrupt and hard to change is absolutely fair but remember that people have broken free from far more repressive and unfair systems.  Take responsibility for change and create it!

**tl;dr: If everyone actually voted and there were a grassroots movement for a change, there would be change. Take the power you have and make sure you VOTE! Taking responsibility for the power and influence you have is essential to hold the government and big business responsible for THEIR part in it.**

"c22xk6e","Consider the flipside of the coin though.  I think its selfish and abrasive for one person in a relationship to just say no and ignore the needs of their partner.

Last night I was reading a magazine about sex after childbirth (relevant to my interests).  Most of the couples surveyed hadn't really resumed their sex life after childbirth.  Mom was too tired or had lost her sex drive or wasn't feeling sexy, whatever.  A few had started up having sex again, but at a snail's pace - once every few months.  The women interviewed said that this was ""more than enough.""  Meanwhile, the men were expressing muted frustration.  They understood the pressures of raising a child and that their wives were tired, even the loss of sex drive, but they were still sexually frustrated and had little to no options for resolution.  One man, who hadn't had sex in 18 months, said that if things kept up as-is he would be driven to cheat.  The women panelists all agreed that cheating was wrong and a husband who would resort to that was a horrible human being.  ""He should be more understanding of her needs!"" they all chimed in.  But who is being understanding of his needs?

Couples aren't always going to be on the same page regarding various issues - religion, politics, money, hobbies, interests, whatever.  Usually there's room for compromise or workarounds.  But with sex, in the context of a monogamous relationship there are little to no compromises or workarounds.  ""You're not allowed to have sex with anyone else...but I don't want to have sex with you.  So, deal with it.""  It's a horrible thing to happen in a relationship, and unfortunately it's more common than it should be.

I believe what Dan Savage is saying is that given the strict rules of monogamy in relationships, one partner should be more than willing to make sure that the other is happy.  ""Be what I need you to be sexually"" can seem selfish, but I think that also includes the unwillingness to have sex or accomodate the other person's wishes.",1309483269,"i think its selfish and abrasive for one person in a relationship to just say no and ignore the needs of their partner.","selfish and abrasive","selfish",NA,FALSE,"selfish and abrasive","abrasive",NA,NA,1

Even now we call it ""funemployed"" because many people are single/childless until they are 30 and have little responsibility.

"c1wzlqo","I think it's more an issue of whether or not the question has any meaning.  What does it even mean to act selflessly?  When it comes down to it, at each moment, the action we take is merely the thing we are most inclined to do.  Our inclinations come from an array of sources far too broad to ever come close to grasping in totality.  Certainly it *feels* as though we exist as some sort of little dude in our heads (or as a stream of consciousness, if you don't want to be that abstract) that takes in information, processes it, and then commands the body to act, but what informs that little dude on how to respond to things at any given moment?

From an evolutionary perspective, our thoughts unfold as they do because the minds of all of our ancestors were, for some reason or another, conducive to reproductive success.  This is not to say that our ancestors selfishly decided, ""Hey, I'm gonna live, and make sure things that aren't like me don't!""  They just happened to do survive and breed, because that's how shit went down.

Basically, I guess what I'm getting at is that the distinction between a selfish and selfless act doesn't necessarily have any foundation in reality.  It's easier for me to explain this if I just say how I feel about the notion of humility, and then it should be easy enough to draw the necessary parallels.

Humility does not exist.  Think about it.  Humility is supposed to be a good thing, right?  We're supposed to be humble instead of being proud, because proud people are assholes.  So it's best for a person to be humble, because that makes them better than other people.  Which is not a terribly humble thought.  So perhaps at this point a person might choose to humbly accept all of their flaws, including the pride they took in their initial humility.  Now, hot damn, we're dealing with a really humble motherfucker here!  Like, Jesus status!  Basically, the presence of the notion of humility in someone's symbolic repertoire precludes the possibility of that person possessing humility.  And since abstractions only exist and have meaning in the interaction of our consciousnesses with the environment, I think it's valid to say that a thinking being possessing no notion of humility or pride could experience them no more than an inanimate object.

Being selfish versus selfless is just a trick of the mind.  We're all both, or all neither, since the one concept doesn't even make sense except as a contrast to the other.  When I see things like this:

&gt; I know people I believe do good things simply because they think it's the right thing to do...not for any self validation. They aren't the kind of people who need it. But of course some people are very transparent and you can tell why they do certain things...for attention, validation etc.

my thought process goes a little bit like this:

It is good to be selfless.  Any action you perform which benefits you is not selfless.  Therefore, you should perform actions that benefit only others.  Once you do this, you are a selfless person.  You have earned the right to feel good about yourself, and to have others feel good about you.

It reminds the of the whole ""Climb a mountain.  Don't tell anyone"" thing.  The idea is that it's extra badass to do something and then receive no praise for it, but that just adds on an extra layer of narcissism when it comes to your own thoughts about the experience.  Pretending not to care what anyone else things in order to think better or yourself is STILL acting with the intent to influence how someone thinks about you.

I present, here, what I believe to be a much more useful way of looking at things:

My freshman year roommate asked me if I believed in altruism, and I responded that I supposed I didn't, since at the very least we did good to consider ourselves good.  He seemed almost hurt by this, asking how I could deny the existence of the most beautiful thing in the universe.  I responded that denying the existence of altruism didn't make the universe a bleaker place for me at all.  On the contrary, I though it was pretty amazing that events just happened to unfold such that we get a warm, fuzzy feeling inside when we do good things for other people.  Sure, you can call the pursuit of that feeling selfish, but calling an action ""good"" is a value judgement that, again, only has meaning in our interaction with the universe; it doesn't exist apart from us.  So that feeling is the only way we can know that what we've done is good.

Of course I do and that acknowledgment should be clear from the word ""human.""

I know that sounds really elitist, but he refused to learn new skills or in any way improve himself to improve his situation. He honestly believed that he would one day win the lottery and spent up to hundreds a week on it or some other get rich quick scheme. Remember the Billy Ripkin baseball card craze? Hundreds, maybe even a couple grand over a single summer flushed down the toilet.  It sounds stupid and selfish, but after all the trauma that I went through between he and my mother, I really needed his guidance and cooperation but he was too busy going to a therapist and whining about how hard *he* had it (OK, until it fucks your kids over), faking a disability claim to get out of work, and sitting around our apt. in the WT projects pinned out of his mind and watching TV. He would kick the shit out of me until I was 14 and started fighting back. The worst of it involved him throwing me around our living room, kicking me while I was on the ground and, no joke, foaming at the mouth. I've got a hell of a fighting style for taking out guys 2x+ my size. He seemed to want to actively obstruct my ambitions but at the same time would drunkenly rave about how I could be POTUS one day. He would go into delusional messianic rants. Until I was in HS, he would pick me up at school and drive straight to the bar. And spend all weekend there. Whenever I see a kid at a bar, I want to crack the parent's fucking skull in for wasting their kid's childhood like that. He had a crackhead living in the apt that he kept trying to fuck. Crazy crazy shit. He always dated women just as crazy as he and above his paygrade. I have no idea how he snagged them for whatever period of time that he did. But he would spend a lot of money trying to live up to their means. If one of their kids started a fight with me, he'd kick my ass to appease them. I once (at age 10) called out his then gf on how she was playing him to make him favor her kid over me and he took a running start from across the room, wound up on the way, and slapped me in the face so hard that I flew a couple feet back. Just writing this, I can actually feel how intensely my face burned for hours after.  
I left home at 17. I had to wait until 24 to go to college. Had to take out mounds of debt to do it because I had nowhere to live. Had to work full time while going through school and believe that the constant exhaustion prevented me from taking full advantage of it. My finances are ruined, but I have a semblance of a career. There are... health considerations that would not have been an issue had he taken me to a physician regularly when I was a kid, he only took me about 4 times. 3 for severe strep throat, and once I actually took myself to after a schoolyard fight got viscious. I'm often worried that I may die young because of long term untreated illness that I don't want to get into, but can't afford to deal with and could have been prevented a long time ago. I just do my best not to think about it. He lived in squalor and undermined my every attempt at changing that. Once delivered a serious brutalization when I threw out a newspaper scrap while trying to clean the house. Why? Becsuse it was for an auction that he figured he'd buy a lot in and magically find a secret cache of nazi gold within. I never learned proper housekeeping and have to struggle to not live like he did. He may have had hoarding tendencies.
I gave him a call a couple years ago and talked a few things out. He's in his 60's now and the regret of missing out on that much of not only my life, but his, has mostly taught him to behave. I know he wants a closer relationship, but he's got to earn it. He's doing OK, but still drinks. Still shoots his mouth off once and a while, but it's different when your 30x yr old son tells you to stop behaving like a child. You tend to listen. Physically, our situation is reversed. I could cripple him or even kill him with a single right hook. I don't want to, but the reversed dynamic is important to note.
I don't think he comprehends my financial situation and he's in bad health and living off a pension, so I'm not going to hang that over his head too much. He does have some responsability for that, but it's not like he can do anything about it. I do feel bad for him. He lost his job and his house got foreclosed on (his own irresponsability) when I was a kid. I comprehend what he was going through with my mother and how hard he had it trying to find a woman that would treat him well. I have a lot of similar issues with finding a mate, except I don't get blisteringly drunk every day, I'm a beer with dinner and then on to personal projects sort, and I work more than 100 hours some weeks. He's almost an adult now. Almost. When he dies, I don't think I will feel much of anything. But... I don't really feel many things of emotional depth anymore, anyway. I don't love him. I don't think loves me, or even knows me. He just knows that in the script, he's the father and I'm the son and somehow that's supposed to mean something without him really doing much. He did a coupke things right. He let me Porky's, Revenge of the Nerds, Night of the Living Dead and any B trash movies I wanted. And I fucking love B trash movies.

"c1p1o4t","Some of these are factually wrong.  

* If you are ""friend-zoned"", it's because the person you like isn't attracted to you (with high probability not physically attracted to you), not because you're not masculine enough.  Changing your personality to become more masculine isn't going to make you a more attractive mate to that person, but it is potentially going to make you a less attractive friend.  I'm not even going to touch the ""women are neurotic and emotional"" bullshit.

* Depression does cause genuine pain and anguish.  I've experienced depression.  I've participated in group CBT.  People suffering from depression do not generally have anger issues, they have (primarily) projection issues.  

* Cigarettes don't stunt emotional growth.  I know plenty of smokers in their 40s, 50s, and 60s who are just as happy and unhappy as similarly-situated nonsmokers.  It's enough that tobacco is addictive and bad for your health.  There's no need for false platitudes about its effects on your ""emotional growth"".

* Your occasional inability to achieve an erection is not your penis telling your the woman you're with is wrong for you.  It's completely normal to sometimes be unable to get it up.  It happens quasi-randomly and can be more readily associated to other stresses or an unhealthy lifestyle.  Get more exercise.

Other points are bad interpersonal advice.

* Trying to distract a woman when she's upset so that you ""don't have to put up with her bullshit"" is not only selfish, but completely transparent.  The thing to do when another human being you care about is upset or emotional is interact with them as people, not treat their emotions as an inconvenience.  People notice when you treat their experiences like inconveniences to work around, too.  It's a good way to end up distancing yourself from everyone around you.

* The advice to marry a woman who ""loves you more than you love her"" seems to be a recipe for emotional dependence or codependency.

Then there is the blatant sexism, which I'm just going to ignore.

1. America and England, although perhaps shouldn't or aren't forced too, choose to engage in every conflict possible. *It shows leadership, dominance and keeps the military strong (or at least strongly funded).* &lt;- I believe this is why we fuck in Libya.

America and Britain identify two types of fights. Full wars with other countries. These wars won't last long as (in a selfish but true quote from the song 'Asshole') *We've got the fucking bombs. Two words: Nuclear fucking weapons*.

Those with terrorists where we can't use Nuclear weapons but can instead send a high tech organised a rich military to fight locals, racking up a 100,000 to ~6,000 kill ratio until they give up (and they will eventually give up as culture changes).

We're waiting for a revolution in China so we can intervene and fuck shit up royally and get our money and gold back.

But you know what I've noticed looking at the crazy shit we read about regarding America? A decade ago after the WTC collapsed, we were pretty worried and scared... ""You don't see Athiests in the Foxholes"" and ""They kill because they believe they'll get 72 virgins""...    That Religion was this irrational belief that causes people to die for what they believe in and will inflict hatred on anyone. That somehow you just can win a fight with some fanatical preacher.

I don't believe that anymore.

A post in relationship_advice I believe where someone questioned why people in west leave relationships for no other reason that bordom, which was answered with a statement about individualism and... I read in to it...that the west now fails to see selfishness as a negative quality but rather a mindset we should be looking to achieve for happiness.

And this is what it's about. The faceless corporations who people don't expect to be moral anymore because they never were like BP, the banks, and so forth?..that mindset has spread to the individual. That's what we want in a Government. To watch America burn other countries to make us richer and steal their oil. That's our tax dollars being spent with me in mind.

Well, eventually we would provide free education to all people so they may be educated to do the work that cannot be automated.

If people choose not to work then they would only be wasting their own lives.

"c1cszxy","I'm not sure how your teacher is on philosophy, but your thesis statement sounds to me like precisely what Thomas Hobbes thinks. Though I can see various ways he could be misread as being ""unfriendly"" to your view.

Hobbes would agree that ""selfish and individualistic"" (isn't this redundant) impulses are normal, and in fact pretty much the only drive among human beings. He also agrees that they tend to be harmful: left unchecked, they render life ""solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short.""

He says that the only way to achieve peace is for people to collectively transfer their ""natural right"" to do anything they want, to an absolute monarch who then decides what they're allowed to do. (Here's one way of reading this that might have led to your teacher's interpretation: it's the responsibility of the people to hold their own destructive impulses in check, and they do this by creating a leader. But this doesn't change the fact that the leader then does ""ensure that they restrain their impulses""--e.g. by instituting laws and punishments.)

All the impulses people have under their monarch are still selfish, but there's now a mechanism for controlling which can be acted on, and so they're not all harmful. (Again, your teacher might have misread Hobbes as thinking that selfish impulses aren't harmful. But this would be confused: for Hobbes, all impulses are selfish. They can be harmful or helpful depending on how they conflict with each other, so some still have to be restrained.)

(Alternatively, your teacher might have noticed--most people overlook it--that Hobbes's monarch, strictly speaking, has no obligation, no responsibility, to his populace at all. He owes them nothing. So you might think that he doesn't have to ""restrain their selfish impulses"". But the monarch does have a responsibility to himself: in this case, to remain in power, since he's best off that way. And the best way to do so is by keeping his populace peaceful and well-ordered.)

So, honestly, I can't see why Hobbes would be treated as opposed to your general thesis. I say this having taught Hobbes in university-level philosophy classes several times.

Hm. I reread your posting and think I see the confusion, which is partly mine.

Hobbes *would* think this: there could be no grounds for prosecuting an actual monarch, because the monarch is the sole determiner of what's legal.

**BUT**: (1) It's dubious whether Jack could reasonably be considered a Hobbesian monarch. In the absence of any monarch, though, there's no such thing as wronging anyone, and so no grounds for prosecution. (2) A Hobbesian monarch is only that as long as his society holds together. If it falls apart, he's de facto failed and no one has any obligation to him or to anyone else. This was surely the case at the end of Lord of the Flies. He has of course failed in his responsibility to himself, but that merely makes him stupid or incompetent, not criminal; and, again, once society has collapsed there are no laws.

Hm. Ok, kind of makes sense now. Sorry I didn't get you anywhere useful.

"c1cnn8h","Schiesty has the right of it. One and two are the same argument: men are dangerous, men's sexuality is inherently violent, men cannot control their sexuality. I can't let the man near my children because he'll rape my children. I can't let the man near me because he'll rape me. You get the equally misguided backlash response of ""I can't let women perceive me as interested, sexual, or aware of her presence, or the law will be brought to bear on me."" They're both irrational, highly damaging fears.

As for rape culture? Cui bono? Rarely is a more ridiculous idea expressed. Watch this.

&gt;A crime culture is a complex of beliefs that encourages violations of personal autonomy and supports acts such as murder, theft, and assault. It is a society where violence is seen as sexy and sexuality as violent. In a crime culture, people perceive a continuum of threatened violation that ranges from normal unsupervised social interaction, selfish but legal acts that impinge on another's rights, to becoming actual victims of crime. A crime culture condones physical and emotional terrorism as the norm.

&gt;In a crime culture, both victims and perpetrators assume that these violations are a fact of life, inevitable as death or taxes. This violence, however, is neither biologically nor divinely ordained. Much of what we accept as inevitable is in fact the expression of values and attitudes that can change.

You can substitute any undesirable act into there. I suppose if you squint and turn your head just right, it can be interpreted as more true than false, but it's not a useful predictive model or framework for resolution. Crime and violence of all sorts are indeed inevitable, though. That doesn't mean that you don't work to lessen it, but our culture (which is just the collection of people in it, the vast majority of whom neither want to rape or be raped) does not encourage rape any more than it encourages theft, and I'm hard pressed to believe that the construct sprung up out of anything besides the shock factor.",1294965911,"in a crime culture, people perceive a continuum of threatened violation that ranges from normal unsupervised social interaction, selfish but legal acts that impinge on another's rights, to becoming actual victims of crime.","selfish but legal","selfish","but",FALSE,"selfish but legal","legal",NA,NA,1

Also, asking questions such as "" Do you think she regretted it after jumping?"" ""Were there scratch marks at her neck ?"" ""how did they cover up the bruising at the funeral home"" or ""how did she do it"" are the best way to end a friendship. It is ignorant and selfish to be asking questions like that, as curious as you may be. And yes, people DID ask me all of those questions in the weeks following my loss. 

If you're not sure of what to say, the best thing is simply to be there. I had a friend who came by, took my hand in hers (something we never do), and held it tightly while i cried. Someone who will always be able to listen and nod and pay attention was the best help for me. 

To say things like ""it's so selfish"" also isn't a good help. Of course, in that situation we also feel like suicide is selfish... but one second after we think they must've really been in pain and that it was okay. 

The best thing anyone said to me at the time was "" I know that you're not ready to forgive her, and you may never forgive her, but eventually you may understand what pushed her to do it.""

For example: A person who was extremely selfish and mercenary in their life is very likely to be reincarnated as an animal.  The reason is, by our experience as humans, animals have a tendency to be very selfish, but their lives and natural circumstances are such that selfishness is necessary for their survival.  Thus, a selfish person would be able to succeed as, say, a fox, and live a fulfilling life in that role, and perhaps be able to overcome their selfishness in living that life.

A person who is clannish, xenophobic, and generally takes on an us/them mentality would have the opportunity to work out those needs and exercise them in a healthy way as a pack predator.

"c13lj8p","Edited: my post was written assuming she did deceive you, re reading your post and other comments, it may be the case that she didn't! Wait for the shock to die down then approach her again, but don't jump to conclusions now.

Edited twice:nm she came clean, I'm being a ditz.

I don't get broody that often or that strongly, but an aunt explained it to me. Wanting a baby is like an insatiable hunger that never, ever goes away. It's not rational and it can't be logic'ed out of you. A partner not wanting a kid won't make it go away, but you'll still love that person. It's a shitty situation to be in love with someone, want their kids, but have them not want any. It would break my heart to be in such a position.

I'm not excusing her here, her behaviour is deplorable and selfish, but I can see her motivations. Have some sympathy for her as well. What she did was wrong, but if she didn't love you she'd have left and had kids with someone else. She wanted your baby, with *you*. I think that should mean something to you.

Either you were both deceitful about your real intentions before marriage, or one or both changed your minds since then. You should have had it out and discussed it properly (and gone your separate ways) but when you love someone you're going to prefer deluding yourself into believing they will come round to your point of view. Like you did when you suddenly went from 'not now' to 'getting a vasectomy'. I wonder how easy it would have been for her to say she didn't like it? In terms of getting what she wanted, a baby with you, she suddenly had no choice but to go off the pill and cross her fingers. Totally wrong but she was acting out of desperation and probably thought you'd come around to the idea. It's not like she had any time left to persuade you or wait for you. To have your baby she had to act immediately.

Your life isn't ruined by this and I do sympathise with you being forced into this situation against your will. Well you can ruin your life over it if you want, but I don't think that's necessary. 

Go and see a relationship counselor. 

Consider this: if you divorce, it will definitely ruin your life. If your relationship is otherwise good, and you can get over this (the trust issues as much as the baby), things could be awesome again in time. Having a kid doesn't have to stop you doing anything at all.

And I really want to make it clear that I do not support or excuse what she did in any way at all, it is disgusting behaviour, but you don't need another comment telling you how fucked up it is, that isn't going to help now though trying to see her point of view might.

"c11ymto","Ask yourself, what is the *biological* underpinning of revenge? It is to reduce the benefits of selfish but uncooperative behaviors. 

For if every time someone steals from you, you respond by chopping off their hands, thieves will think twice before stealing from you. Murder your family or tribe member, and you repay them by killing them. You make sure that any potential benefit someone gets from an uncooperative behavior is offset by the harm you do to them. 

In game theory, there is a game I'm sure you've heard about called Prisoner's Dilemma. And a vengeful strategy called ""Tit-for-Tat"" is rated one of the best strategies one can follow. It is simple - cooperate if your opponent cooperates, defect if your opponent defects. If someone helps you, you help them back. If someone hurts you, you hurt them back. 

However, not everyone is able to get vengeance. Many times, because of the social nature of humans, vengeance gets out of hand as alliances of humans gang up together. Such escalation of vengeance (AKA Palestine, Romeo and Juliet, excuse for pretty much every war) is not necessarily materially beneficial to a society or government. 

This is why within a state, the government monopolizes violence and thus vengeance. As a 3rd party arbiter of vengeance, the government tries to make sure vengeance is not escalated to the tribal level. 

Such institutionalized vengeance is called *punishment*. On behalf of the victims, a government inflicts social, economic, and bodily harm on a perpetrator. 

As members of a state, we give the state the power of violence. 

Does it matter that it's not *me* in particular that's pulling the trigger, but that my ""friend"" the government is pulling the trigger for me? Does that make it any less vengeful? As long as the punishment is given by the 3rd party called government, we often say ""Justice is served"". Their punishment usually more than satisfies our desire for vengeance.

"c10yyq8","To zoom out for a moment: This is the tail end of a series of (on average) rather nasty conversations I as a visitor from /r/atheism have been having in a Christian forum on the topic of universal health insurance. You are one of 3 or 4. I noted an abhorrent tendency of these people to refuse to contribute to any communal good. From previous experiences with Christians and Republicans, I figured I was dealing with more of the same. It took me a moment or three and some hostile mutual accusations of Christianity before I realized that I was in fact dealing with a different species, Libertarians.

I hate getting egg on my face for being uninformed and wrong, so I've made a serious effort to understand more about Libertarianism. Here's what I've found out:

* You're right about Iceland. About 300,000 people formed a libertarian society in Iceland in the Middle Ages, at a time when technology was essentially craftsmanship and foreign trade did not exist.
* The heroes of that society were the lawyers. So they had a large caste of people who collected money just for being the regulators of exchanges of power between people. But heaven forbid you'd call those a government! Personally, I'd harbor a deep suspicion for any society whose heroes are lawyers.
* Libertarianism is an ideology favored by selfish assholes. Young, well-to-do young men propagate a system where, in establishing a business, they use a ladder to climb a metaphorical hill and then, having climbed that hill, outlaw ladders. Sorely lacking compassion, Libertarians have a penchant for excluding the weak, the old, the ill and the incompetent from their considerations. If people starve, sucks to be them.
* Other people have remarked on the same flaw that I found apparent: With no regulation, large businesses can and will use their market power to eliminate their competitors, and then use their monopoly to exploit their workers and customers.

As best I can tell, the libertarian idea rests on some thinking that is both muddle-headed and cynical.

Libertarianism is seeing an upsurge in the US. First, because there is a large base of stupid and gullible people to be found; second, because selfishness is a concept they can all get behind; and finally, they are being sponsored by America's corporations so they can clamor for less taxes.

In summary, as far as I can tell, you are one of a group of selfish but gullible chumps unwittingly running interference for Big Business in the USA.

You may tell me that many of my accusations about Libertarianism don't apply to you, as you're an Anarchist. That's cool, I've learned a bit about anarchists too: It turns out I was wrong about a lack of a functioning real-world example. Rather, you are fortunate to be living at a time when an entire nation is already operating on this principle, and has been doing so for a decade already.

"c0yz95d","I actually have a very positive outlook on life and a very happy marriage.

The fact of the matter is that all of our actions are purely selfishly motivated.  We act because we have a need or a desire.  It may be a more constructive need or desire or a more destructive one and you might apply moral goodness or badness to either/or but being selfish isn't innately wrong or bad.

At the point of asking a woman out you generally don't know her too well and at that point it's hard to have any sort of true empathy (though we often trick ourselves with a generalist, pseudo-empathy).  We approach her because we have a need we want to fulfill...she may end up being happier also, but that's not your primary concern.  No one walks up to someone else and says ""I think I could be really good for you"" without coming away looking like a pretentious ass.

In reality, and here's the truth, a romantic relationship (or any relationship) is just a completely selfish, but mutually beneficial, relationship.  You become as one meta-unit and because of how close you are what is good for the other is also good for you.  There is more, we naturally develop bonds of empathy between ourselves as we get closer and trust more.  This is still beneficial to ourselves first and to the others second.  You may be really good for someone but if they annoy the shit out of you you will generally break up with them...this thing isn't selfless.

It's nice to think that you'll find someone who'll fulfill you and who you might fulfill (this is always the lesser concern) but it just isn't what happens.  You start in the twitterpation phase where you barely know each other and generally fill in the gaps of your knowledge with an ideal you have that is nothing like them. You are desperate to explore their mental and physical territory but eventually you know all their valleys and hills and when the mystery starts to disappear you have to live in the real world again with the real them.  And that's where any sort of love really comes into play (or rather when you can tell if you really love them or not).  Even then you aren't selfless, you have just normalized their happiness to be beneficial in other ways to you.  You've associated them being kinder and nicer to you with their happiness so thoroughly that you gain happiness from them being happy even without the later stimulus.  It's a fun place to be, but most people aren't happy there because they never expected the drug-like twitterpation to end.

With the guys asking girls out I'm not judging either of them negatively.  The guys are acting out of self-interest and that's fine.  The girls are acting out of self-interest also...this is expected.  But either feeling that their selfish actions create a moral indebtedness in the other is not only foolish, but boorish also.

Think of the bum that comes up and washes your windshield without asking you. Sure, you might justify that his motivations are to help you see out of your car better (possibly helping you avoid an accident) but the truth is that that is only a secondary (if not tertiary) motivation and his real cause is getting some money. Are you obligated to give him money? Are you obligate to be polite and tell him you didn't want your windshield washed and so you aren't going to pay him most likely causing him to curse you out, throw shit on your car or potentially even attack you? Are you really a bad person if you just meekly smile and drive off without saying anything?  On the flipside, is he really a bad person for hoping to make some money while helping someone out?

I personally agree entirely.  The problem with redistribution is it takes away the incentive to innovate.  Why should I work harder, or come up with new ideas, if a huge percentage of what I gain is going to be taken from me and given to people at the bottom?   Yes, that's selfish, but most people are motivated by self interest, particularly in economic matters.  And unless you have a way to change humans (I sure don't) we are stuck with that reality.

Now, the widening gap is of some concern - I don't debate that.  But it's hard to say what caused it.  The tax cuts, for instance, clearly helped the lower income folks as much as the high earners.  I'm not convinced that it's some policy issue that has caused the gap.  It could just be a cycle of some kind.  For the rich, a lot of their money is tied up in investments.  For the rest of us, most of our money is in the form of wages.  So when you have a bad economy, people become unemployed and wages tend to drop, resulting in the rich having a greater percentage because they are more insulated.

"c0wxmyu","I wouldn't be surprised if this wasn't real, but just in case, I'll respond.

Be prepared for A. Not because it is necessarily more likely, but because it is a distinct possibility.

Don't think about B through C. Don't over think this. Don't over analyze. Stop thinking about marriage and kids and so on, with her, and in general.

Meet with her privately and see what she wants to do or talk about or whatever. It might be something mundane, or it might not be.

Let's be honest here. We could all give you advice not to do it or to do it and so on, but that doesn't matter. In all honesty, it doesn't matter what we say, if she does confess her attraction or something similar happens, then you guys are probably going to have sex eventually. Let's be honest. If we were to construct a time line of events that represented the ontogeny of this relationship, masturbation would be at least one of the items. You're not a sicko or a freak or weird, you're just a male human (I assume. I will go ahead and say that if you are not male and the situation turns out to be not A, then my advice would be to satisfy whatever sexual urges you have. That's only sort of a joke. Only sort of.)

So there really is no dilemma here. It all depends on information that you don't have. If it's A then you have a special platonic relationship with your hot first cousin. If it's not then you have a special non-platonic relationship with your hot first cousin. But don't have delusions of getting married and having kids and so on. Don't feel guilty about it or bad or gross or whatever. You don't owe it to your parents or your uncles or society to not have sex with your first cousin. There's no reason for being hard on yourself like that. It won't do you any good and it will just eat away at you, possibly her, and have a negative affect on the relationship.

So more useful advice would probably be to work on not regretting what you have done or feel like doing. Work on not having them and not feeling obligated to everybody else to not have sex with your first cousin.

With that being said, don't act like it is something that you are obligated to tell anybody about or that she is now your girlfriend or anything like that. You are both adults and entitled to privacy.

This is the kind of situation where you need to be selfish, but also realistic. Don't pretend like you've found Mrs. Right and can get married and have kids and so on. I'm not saying it can't be that way. I'm just saying don't assume that it is or can be. Don't assume that she even wants that. With any relationship you need to be prepared for failure and prepare yourself to handle it. That is more necessary in this case than in most others.

If there is the small chance that you can ignore your sexual urges, then good for you. Just don't suppress them. Don't make excuses like that her uncles would kill you or society frowns upon it or that your kids will be retarded and so on. Don't make those excuses to yourself or to her. It's just self control, it doesn't need justification or an excuse. If you can't handle having sex with your first cousin, then don't do it. If she wants to, then tell her that nicely. It's not like she won't understand. Make sure you treat her like you should be treating herself. Make sure that she knows you are making a rational decision and that it isn't a knee-jerk reaction do to repulsion. Don't embarrass her and don't hide your feelings or pretend that hers aren't reciprocated. Just because one can do something doesn't mean that one should. Self control might be boring, but it has its advantages.

If it is A or this private meeting doesn't seem to be about her having similar feelings then don't try to communicate your feelings. It will just have to be a part of your relationship. This probably isn't the first hot girl you've ever seen that you won't get to have sex with and won't be the last. Just add her to that list. The bright side is that you will still get to see her and talk to her and be close to her. You can't really blame her for friend-zoning you here. You were kind of family-zoned by default to begin with anyway.

I think you came here looking for excuses. That's weak. The fact that you are even considering this means that otherwise something will happen if A doesn't turn out to be the case. Don't not do it because of lame excuses people might give you here. Either do it because it's what you want and don't regret it and don't expect marriage and kids and happily ever after to be the ending to the story, or, if you can't do those things, and assuming you do have some capacity for self control, don't do it.

Well, its pretty difficult to find discussion about the psychological effects of immortality (for fairly obvious reasons I guess), but I dug [this](http://physicspost.com/articles.php?articleId=163&amp;page=6) up after a bit of googling. The interviewee is Bruce J. Klein, the founder of the [immortality institute](http://www.imminst.org/). 
My opinions, which I formed independently (its not something I have made an effort to look into), are broadly speaking, that having the burden of a limited life span lifted would change the way people approach life fundamentally. At the moment most people treat it as a race with the stages: get an education, find a job, find a wife, have kids, raise them, die. Obviously that's a simplification and a generalisation, but I think it is fairly accurate in that. You can basically estimate a time limit for any of those stages, because you know how long you are going to live. If you haven't succeeded in completing the stage and are drawing towards the end of your time limit you may become more and more desperate or willing to settle for the best you can get. Whether that is a generally good thing or not is, I'll admit, debatable. But the point is at the moment we don't have a choice. Do or die. 

People choose to live different lives, and many, when they reach the end, may wish they could have lived a different one, or that they had made different choices. My choice would be to live many lives.

&gt; People are still greedy, still selfish.

&lt;citation needed&gt;, by which I mean I don't believe this is a fair generalisation, but stems rather from peoples love of self deprecation, implying the tacit agreement that we obviously mean other people, not ourselves, or we wouldn't be able to say it. Its false modesty basically. Obviously some people are greedy and selfish, but they tend to stand out. I don't know any personally, do you?

&gt; if death disappeared then most religions would probably disappear or change unrecognizably, since so many of them are based on maintaining a paranoia and guilt complex about an afterlife.

I don't think this is the reason people follow religions. 

&gt; How many people want to be a subsistance farmer if they know that they will be there for eternity ?

I see it the other way: people who otherwise wouldn't want to farm, as they don't want to waste years of their life doing something they might not enjoy, would be more interested in doing it. Maybe spend 10 years farming. Then go to college for 5 years. Work in an office for another 15, work your way up to management, as the management get bored and move out to the country to work on a farm. You aren't even 1/20th of the way through your life.

If by manage and control, you mean eliminate, then I agree. I don't like to pussy foot around with language, that is for politicians. ""Manage"" and ""control"" are broad terms that could mean pretty much anything.

"c0owppd","This is where I do not understand pessimism.

I would consider myself an optimistic realist. If anything, I am probably more of a realist than most people. But it has never caused me to be pessimistic.

I do not believe in God, or a higher purpose or a plan. Nor do I believe in an afterlife. Yet I do not ponder why I exist. I understand that I could die at any moment - today, tomorrow, or 20 years from now - yet I do not fear death. It is part of life and something we all need to accept at some point. And when the time comes, I know that I will not be in a position to notice the difference anyways. I recognize the bad choices I have made in the past, but I don't dwell on them so much as to miss new opportunities. I can learn from past mistakes without placing unneeded disdain toward my past actions. I can feel guilt without feeling self-hate. I can be disappointed in myself yet not question my personal ability.

I believe that in the grand time-line of the universe, my existence as an individual is entirely insignificant. The only worth we have is those perceived by ourselves in society. Yet this does lessen my own perceived importance. I realize that life, as a whole, is utterly pointless. Entirely. That the feelings I feel and the memories I hold, the essence that is the human ""soul"", comes down to nothing more than chemical and electrical reactions within my body. But this does not depress me. I recognize that the world is full of pain and suffering, that there are people who are truly inherently evil and selfish, but it does not cause me to lose faith in humanity. Perhaps because there is no faith to begin with, but merely an expectation built by the society around me. Not one of my own, but of those who raised me. Still, it does not cause me to be pessimistic. I could go on and on with my realizations of the world. My thoughts on subjects and my indifference to the pain my realizations should cause me. The point is, you can be a realist in every single way and not be pessimistic.

In the end, I recognize that I live for a short amount of time. That when boiled down I have two primary choices in life. I can be happy, or I can not be happy. No matter what I do, how much I toil, how much I suffer, or how much I may succeed, I cannot let my own accomplishments (or lack there-of) get in the way of my own personal happiness. For in the end, what you do doesn't matter anyways. It is how you experienced life that matters.

On the scale of life you can work to achieve two things: Memories or Materials. Both exist on opposite sides of the spectrum but are not mutually exclusive, and for different people either can bring varying levels of happiness. The trick is to find a medium where you can enjoy what you can while you are still around. For when you are gone your material things will be given to someone else and your memories forgotten. Memories are for yourself and they are only worth as much as you put weight on them. It is pointless to worry about what lies down the road. Live in the now, yet still plan for the future. Just don't dwell on it to the point that you forget to enjoy what is going on around you at this moment. For a moment is brief and cannot be relived. Enjoy all of it while you can.

If we are talking about minor children, then sure. One should not be giving money to charity when their kids need it more. But we are talking about adults here. I fail to see how it can be considered selfish to not give your own money to another adult. Exactly how long should a parent be obligated (for fear of being labeled ""selfish"") to support their adult children? Through college? What if it takes them 6 years to graduate? What if they decide to get a masters degree, or go to medical school?

Hey, mine too! Tuition plus room and board was about $8,000 per semester, $16,000 per year. During the school year I had an on-campus job (for all four years). My freshman year summer I worked two jobs. I had internships my sophomore and junior year summers.

    - Go to a junior college first
    - Go to a local school and live at home

"c0kbc1s","Agh, this happened to a dear friend of mine. He'd been dating a girl for three months, things weren't going so well, then all of a sudden she's pregnant. She was taking birth control, and her mom's a nurse so she's aware of the birds and the bees - I think she just wanted to tie my friend to her forever so she stopped taking her pills and suddenly became vehemently anti-abortion. They split up before the baby was born, but stayed friends - but then she turned into psycho bitch from hell. At the moment, he's paying child support that he can't afford (crappy job + still living with his parents), it's derailed his budding music career, he can only see the baby on her (bitchy) terms, even though he's a thousand times better with kids than she is, and his family hasn't seen the baby for months. IMO, she's not mature enough to raise a child, and definitely not mature enough to maintain a civilized relationship with that child's father. Even though my friend is really trying to be part of his son's life, his ex is blocking him, and will no doubt tell the kid that his father ""abandoned"" him. 

A lot of the suggestions from other people say you should ""man up"" and care for the child - but that's assuming she'll ""woman up"" and treat you like an equal partner in the process. But if you were an equal partner, would she be having the child against your will? This phase is a preview of things to come - if she won't take your wishes into account now, what's to say she'll take your wishes into account later, and allow you a reasonably active role in the child's life? Sounds like she's being incredibly selfish - ""I want a baby,"" not ""I want to give a child a good life"" or ""let's have a baby together, as equal partners."" (not to mention that it's not going to remain a baby for long - if she wants something that will be cute and dependent for its whole life, she should get a puppy - is she ready to make the long-term committment of providing for another human being's needs for 18+ years?) If she's treating you as a sperm donor now, she's likely to treat you as a cash machine in the future. Sorry to be so brutal, but I've seen it happen a lot (I'm female, for what it's worth). 

In trying to convince her to abort, remember that her hormones are going crazy right now, so even if she's usually pro-choice, she might be feeling really (emotionally) attached to the little zygote. There might also be fear that she's going to lose you, and a baby is the only way she can ""keep"" you (yes, this is utter crazy talk - but hormones can make you crazy). If I were you, I'd emphasize that you *want* to have kids with her eventually, this isn't the last chance, but the timing is terrible and you want to wait until you can give a child some level of financial security, stability, etc. Also, maybe you want to have some other adventures with her before becoming parents? And what are her dreams, beyond being a mom? Whatever those dreams are, it will be a thousand times harder to achieve them with a child in tow. Not impossible - and she will tell you that she will be ""different"" than other people's horror stories - but wouldn't it be great to pursue your dreams now, and then give your child the full attention s/he deserves later, when there's space in your life? 

If she still refuses to consider abortion, then definitely get a paternity test, if only to show that if she's going to treat it as ""her"" baby, then you have no choice than to do the same. Also, does she have any friends/family members who can talk some sense into her? Maybe you're too close to the issue, but someone else will seem more objective. At the end of the day, all these arguments are rational, and she might not be thinking rationally. 

tl;dr - hormones may be making her crazy and selfish, but it might help to make her feel secure in the relationship, so losing the baby wouldn't be such a threat.

This is irrelevant and has nothing to do with the discussion.

If you are, feel free to prove so with scans your policies from various times before and after and show everyone the cost differences and line items associated with them.

"c0gx42x","Everything we believe about ourselves and our interaction with our world is a projection, so of course I am projecting and I am obviously aware of that. If I were gay I would project that in some form would I not? Also, you do realize that what I wrote previously was about how I *feel* about my cousin, not some literal analysis of the truth. Also, I won't argue with you about her not having the 'capacity to understand a complex relationship', because this is just obvious... From my perspective, she doesn't have any of the preconceived notions or expectations of what a relationship is or what it is supposed to be, and to me that is wonderful. In fact, it is one of the reasons I love her so much! When she jumps into my arms, she is not playing some social mating game or making all sorts of judgments about my every move, everything is just natural and innocent which is wonderful to experience. Also, so you understand, I do not imagine some complex relationship, and I'm not quite sure how you could have gotten that from my writing. 
 
Now, to your point about being 'threatened' by mature women, let me be clear about that: I am not at all 'threatened' by women, I am mostly repulsed by the manipulative and selfish side of women and how they view relationships. Granted most women are not manipulative or selfish, but that is the face that tends to reach into my world via media and social networks. Mostly to me it is about attraction and emotional comfort level, and pretty much 99% of women my age or older are essentially repulsive. It is not all looks obviously, and in fact it is primarily the socially conditioned attitudes which turn me off the most, not really their physical body or face.
 
Yes, I do 'long to be a child again', but I don't see how that should just be an empty dream. You even said yourself 'we're all kids wandering around in grown-up clothes', so why identify with older generations who insist that life is a machine and we're all just cogs meant to work our entire lives as complacent apathetic heterosexual workers.
 
I don't have an 'obsessive search for purity', I don't search for anything, I just look at the cards life deals me, and I play the cards that make the most sense to me. Also, so you know, I don't consider my love for my cousin an obsession, although for a period of time I was obsessively seeking a level of understanding with my self and my own unique interests as a human being. I know this type of thing is not something that anyone would encourage, so it's not surprising that you would try to push me back with words like ""catering to this obsession"" and ""breaking the habit""... This is not an 'obsession' nor a 'habit', and I don't do any 'hanging around the pie shop' as you put it... 
 
""Breaking the habit will take a tough two weeks, but from there you will be able to explore your mind with a clear head."" &lt;--- I have no idea what that means... I have never felt a more clear understanding of myself and these feelings, and I could *ONLY* reach that level by *ACCEPTING* how I felt, and letting go of my attempts to force it out of my mind and replace it with other ideas, or to deny my own feelings over and over... It was only when I accepted myself and accepted my feelings for what they were that they became normalized and the self-torment went away...
 
Yes, What is in my head is my own, but I do not feel I need to act like it is a 'secret' or some kind of hidden fantasy. In fact I think holding it in as if it is a secret is only a bad thing.
 
""You never have to feel guilty for your thoughts."" Thank you! Just realize that all your other statements essentially scream: ""Be guilty for your feelings, and stop your obsessive behavior because it's not a real part of you. Your feelings are make believe and you are not a real person for feeling that way. Fix yourself because you are not 'OK' with 'US'""
 
Anyway, I apologize if I seem defensive here, I enjoy conversation and I just want people to realize that people like myself have real feelings. We're not just making this up and latching on to some fantasy, this is something that I *could not put out of myself* because it was a part of who I am!
 
The thing that I really want to understand now is, where do we go from here? How is the world going to change in the next few decades to make this kind of a thing 'OK' in the right way? We obviously need to learn from our mistakes with the Gay Rights movement, and we need to just open up completely to all forms of love and expression of love. If we don't find a way to create safe and legitimate avenues of expression for these feelings, people are going to feel trapped and isolated, and some of these people may resort to doing things which God forbid would harm or take advantage of a child against their will. I know absolutely no one would ever stand for that kind of thing, so why don't we try to create an avenue of acceptance for these people, instead of trying to convince them they are sick or wrong or somehow less human than anyone else, and locking them away where they have no one to communicate with openly...
 
I have ideas I could share, but I know that there will be tons of opposition to even discussing this kind of thing, because it would involve suggesting things that would totally shatter our accepted worldview, and finding a reasonable 'Way' instead of an unreasonable 'No Way'... 
 
Would anyone here want me to bring up some of those ideas here?

You sound like a software developer yourself, so if I have offended you in my posts, I apologize, but we are entitled to our own opinions.

&gt;It sounds a bit harsh, but, then don't use them.

I use them because I can. This applies for the majority of pirates. I may sound selfish, but I'm just being rational. Why would you use something inferior when you can get the best one for free? It may be subjected to morality and whatnot, but I have no qualms in my conscience. 

&gt;Or, much better, use something else, which is a lot cheaper

If it's only marginally inferior, I turn to open source (if available).

&gt;they make the situation worse for everyone who does not want to break laws

Software piracy is not illegal everywhere in the world. When your government pirates software to minimize costs, why would it be legal? With internet, outsourcing is not a problem.

&gt;If people were in need of an affordable photoshop alternative, some company would make one.

I use one when I don't need the heavy-duty features of Photoshop. It's called Paint.NET.

&gt;What they need is a simple application to do some retouching, but instead of searching one, they just download the biggest and greatest version of Photoshop.

The reason Adobe hasn't gone bankrupt is that people (mainly corporations) still buy Photoshop. The pirating of individuals actually serves as free publicity. Word of mouth is a powerful tool, attributing Photoshop as **the** image editing software. Were pirating not an option, the term 'to photoshop' wouldn't exist in the dictionary.

&gt;Even if all the people on earth do immoral things, you should at least think about not doing them.

Like I said, immorality is subjective. This has been demonstrated countless times in history, for example, by murdering in the name of 'good'. There is also this mentality called cognitive dissonance where people rationalize their actions with respect to others around them. I have thought about it and I see piracy as rational.

&gt;If learning to live without them is so easy, there is no point in pirating other than breaking the law.

Can you live without the internet? Yes, you can. Like many things in life, software is considered a luxury. I only need food, clothes and shelter to live. Anything else other than those required to earn these basic needs is a luxury. If I can get this luxury for free, why not? On the other hand, if you make a living from pirated software, that is then frowned upon in my opinion.

&gt;And for one reason, they do that so that no one has to pirate any software.

So if I spend several years developing a (crappy) image editing software, will people be inclined to use it over their pirated Photoshop because of my personal sacrifice? Of course not. In the end, people are selfish and rational. They only do what's best for them.

It is vital to sort psychsomatic pain first.  I am NOT saying you are hyperchondriac or anything of the sort.

The pursuit of this is absolutely selfish but absolutely necessary.  THIRDLY take pain medication, anti inflammatories and keep a low GI, frsh vegetable fruit diet constantly.  Limit caffine, cheese, choc but dont deny life's simple pleasures.  FORTHLY: stay connected to a few very good people.  Your husband and one or two others.  I mean really connected, get them on board with how it is for you, treat the management of your fibromyalgia as a shared project (one you are ultimatrely responsible for), even make wee projects within this.  Make sure you and your husband have a healthy, mutually caring relationship.  It is not ALL about you, and he must share this journey with you - not relate to you as if you weren't or should not be suffering.  FIFTHLY:  Never, and i mean never give up or into the fibro.  In fact, make friends with it and listen to what it may be telling you.  Be very aware that the world does not ttravel at the speed of a fibro sufferer and that a good amount of the suffering comes from being at odds with the pace of the world.  You may never reconcile this or you may (as you get 'better') but don't measure your health against the population at large!

SIX:  Live with it - not against it.  SEVEN: Get cats!  EIGHT: enjoy a very gentle sport (i do lawn bowls) but try petanque, dog walking at a lesurely pace, cleaning the beach of rubbish - with a small bag not a truck and trailer, darts etc.  Gain some successes.

Yep, assholes like you ARE the problem.
How could this violate your rights, rightard? Hmmm?

From the Republican perspective? I work hard for my money so that I can take care of myself and those around me. People I don't know are less important to me than my family and friends. So what is being forced up me is the idea that I should take money that I may someday need for them or myself, and give it to people that I don't know.

&gt;It comes down to Republicans refuse to do anything that doesn't directly benefit THEM. While you Republicans have learned to not start your argument with ""I don't want to pay for anyone else"" that is what it all boils down to.

There's a lot more legitimate reasons than that. But the same could be said for a lot of people supporting public plan. It is in their personal best interest to have free* health insurance, so fuck the people who are actually paying for it.

&gt;Yet you Republican fucktards seem to forget that you may need help someday too. Oh, that's right. Republicans figure in the future they'll dump the problem off on someone else, or they'll get MEDICARE, also known as socialized medicine.

Most Republicans I know aren't against reform. They're against public plan. They're not trying to dump the problem off someone else, they just want to fix the existing system. Of course, the current Republicans in power are borderline retarded and keep listening to the neocon section of their base, so this will probably never actually get into the public knowledge.

&gt;How do you selfish rightard assholes explain that away? If YOU don't want care, why are you so determined to keep if from people who DO want it? Basically the Republicans are dishonest and selfish traitors.

People aren't determined to keep others from getting care. They just don't want to be forced into paying for it.

""
When this letter arrived in my Love Letters InBox, it was too risqué to post on Boston.com (we’re a family website, after all). But because I believe the reader’s question is valid and worthy of our discussion, I’ve decided to post it -- with all of the writer's R-rated phrases replaced by my G-rated euphemisms. I'm asking that you use my euphemisms in your comments so I can post them. I love a good euphemism, don’t you? 

Q: I am a 30 Year old male. I have been dating a wonderful woman for 2.5 years. I would describe everything about her as perfect except for one thing. She absolutely refuses to [make me a grilled cheese sandwich]. Now I want to ask her to marry me, but the thought of going the rest of my life without receiving [grilled cheese sandwiches] is definitely a worry. I fear I may resent her eventually, or possibly feel the need to seek [grilled cheese sandwiches] out somewhere else when enough time has passed. It has already been 2.5+ years since I last experienced a [grilled cheese sandwich]. It is starting to consume my thoughts. I don't know if this one thing is enough to be a deal-breaker. Everything else is perfect. I don't know what to do!

-- [Needing Grilled Cheese], Boston

A: NGC, have you talked to this woman about why she’s so opposed to grilled cheese? Do her reasons seem valid and specific (past trauma, health issues, etc.)? Is there any room for negotiation? Has she always been opposed to grilled cheese or is it just specific to you?

You must tell her that the lack of grilled cheese is standing in the way of your commitment. I know it’s difficult to say – it sounds so petty and selfish -- but I’m here to tell you it’s a valid concern. You’ve probably heard this before, but disagreements about sex and money are usually what end relationships. If you’re resenting her now, fast forward 10 years. It will get worse.

Grilled cheese sandwiches are awesome. Especially with tomatoes and fancy cheese, like Brie. But some people would rather eat them than make them. And some people are allergic to them and can’t go near them.

But you’re not allergic. You like them a lot. If your girlfriend can’t come up with a grilled-cheese compromise, yes, to quote the wise Liz Lemon, this may be a deal breaker, ladies. Is the rest of her perfect enough to balance the sexual incompatibility?

Readers? Am I wrong? Can one live without grilled cheese if it’s their favorite food? Should a 30-year-old have to make that sacrifice? Share your thoughts here. And remember -- be respectful, G-rated, and thoughtful. Not like I need to ask. You guys are pros.

I am 20 years old and I graduated high, where I established most of my friendships, 2 years ago.  Ever since then my friend count has diminished.

My best friend Ashley I met when I moved here in 8th grade.  Every one hated her.  She was loud, annoying, and selfish.  But some how we meshed.  I was quiet, a listener, and generous.  We stayed close all the way though high school, but after high school I started to see how unhealthy our friendship was.  And this past year we have gone our separate ways.  I run into her all the time and I have to say it depresses me.  I went to her baby shower just last weekend so we had a bit of a chance to catch up, and she has no aspirations.  She doesn't plan to go to school, the baby's dad was a one night stand at a night club, and she keeps some rather trashy company now.

I've had many friends come and go, but I'm one of those typical secluded people.  I was there to listen to people, but I didn't share enough of myself so it was hard to establish any connections.

To say that as an end-all-be-all is ridiculous. Just because the women in your family wouldn't be to have an honest relationship doesn't mean that does for *all* women. I know plenty of women who would definitely want to know and to deny someone of that is awful. I think that honesty is always the right thing 

""*In fact, my grandmother and two aunts were very adamant that revealing the ""truth"" at that point was a selfish, childish action, because the only thing it accomplishes is absolving your own sense of guilt. In return, it makes your partner feel like shit.*""

I absolutely hate this mentality. The only way that being open and honest is childish is if you're telling your significant other *only* to absolve yourself. If you are telling them because you feel like they deserve the truth, that is in no way childish or selfish, and in fact it's extremely selfish to keep it to yourself. The *cheating* was selfish and childish. The selfish part is already done, and there is nothing that you can do to change that.

People say that living with your guilt is less selfish but it's extremely selfish because in that case, you get to decide if you stay together. To tell your significant other, you are giving *her* the power to decide what she wants to do with your relationship. Whereas living with guilt, while shitty, lets you keep the power which at that point, you don't deserve.

"c07txm7","&gt;Pessimism- the tendency to see, anticipate, or emphasize only bad or undesirable outcomes, results, conditions, problems, etc

No I agree with that.  The key is to notice that that this does not correspond to how a pessimist acts.  It just deals with how people interpret and think about what happens to them.  It does not say pessimists are reserved to complete inaction because they find every pursuit futile.  For example, I hate going to plays, but my wife doesn’t, and so I begrudgingly go and sit there and loathe and whine silently to myself throughout.  But when she asks me afterwards, I often say I had a good time, because it does no good to say otherwise.  And when she talks about a future play, I think to myself, “oh god, this is going to be terrible,” but I still go.

Pessimistic thought does not necessitate pessimistic action.  In general, I don’t think there really is any difference between how a pessimistic person and an optimistic person acts, the difference is just that the pessimistic person doesn’t think the activity will be satisfying or really bring them joy (but conversely, not doing the activity is no more likely to bring them any satisfaction or joy either, so might as well just do the activity as long as other people find it worthwhile).  I actually find that this makes a lot of true pessimists to be even more self-less and compassionate towards others, because their own happiness does not factor in to a decision.  Optimism on the other hand makes you search out what optimal in some sense, and tends to be much more self-centered.

In response to:

&gt;But I honestly don't see how you call yourself a pessimist under any definition.

As I said before: 

&gt;I don’t consider myself a pessimist, I consider myself a skeptic.

You keep bringing up pessimism, and I feel an obligation to defend it because I can relate to it so heavily.  And I see that what my ability to get out of the trap of pessimism are not something I can expect everyone to have, and so I feel that some degree of obligation towards assisting pessimists (and likewise, convincing optimists that pessimists can be very good and well-meaning people).

&gt;I guess I'll have to ask here too. What is the definition of a pessimist? What is the definition of an optimist? And can I hope that these definitions actually conform to common usage?

I think we’re using the same general definition of optimism and skepticism, but I think he key is to realize that, as I say above: thoughts don’t necessarily translate into actions.  I know a lot of optimists that are really egotistical and selfish, but they love life and enjoy every activity they pursue.  And I know a lot of pessimists that are really genuinely nice and caring people, that are active in the community and do a lot for the future of humanity, they just find no real enjoyment from all of it.

You seem to feel comfortable with optimism=good, pessimism=bad, and so you assume that pessimistic people must all be bad and worthless people, and that all optimistic people perform good wholesome actions.  But, from personal experience, I haven’t seen any evidence of any such correlation.

"abbq","&gt;If it's never moral to be selfish but moral to give, then how are others good for taking what you give while you are not?

Selfishness is not simply defined as *""take""*. It's kind of *""take""* that comes *""at the expense of others""*. Altruism is the reverse of selfishness. It is *""give""* but it is *""give""* with a condition. Altruism is *""give at the expense to oneself""*.

Remember the condition *""at the expense to oneself/others""* because it is very important.

You have made a common mistake of confusing *""self-interest""* with *""selfishness""*. Robert Wright articulated a very good argument in his book Non-zero and basically what you think is ""seflish"" is actual his version of ""self-interest"". The simple act of take/giving for one's own benefit is self-interest but this has nothing to do with selfishness.

Self-interested actions can sometimes be selfish but not always. My argument is that selfishness is as rational as altruism (both are a bit extreme but understandable) however altruism is typically more valued because human beings are intuitively social creatures and generally prefer the value of group survival over the individual who exploits.

Thus, selfishness is blame-worthy, altruism is praiseworthy.

"c056b50","Ah yes, here we are. Look, I don't agree with this article but I agree with some of the approach it takes: economics is the stepdaughter of philosophy. You need a bit of a philosophical reflection on human nature etc. in order to build a economic theory. Therefore I consider this Ian Angus a more worthier opponent than most other Leftists/Liberals/Socialists.

He writes:

""Hardin assumed that human nature is selfish and unchanging""

""Hardin didn’t describe the behaviour of herders in pre-capitalist farming communities — he described the behaviour of capitalists operating in a capitalist economy.""

Basically, this the usual Progressive view of human nature that's shared by a wide range of schools of thought from Marxists to not only New Liberals but even some Old Liberals (say, J.S. Mill): human nature is malleable, it's formed by circumstances, by society, there is no real free will or inherent, autonomous consciousness or mind or soul, and in a rationally arranged society people can learn to be rational and good. Their view of human nature is unconstrained: Man can be formed into any shape you want.

On the other side there is the Conservative/Traditional view of human nature: humans are capable of both good and evil. Usually they are selfish but not too evil. The general human nature is unchanging, though it behaves differently according to the challenges it faces. Sometimes we are good, sometimes we are evil. Sometimes we are rational, sometimes we aren't, both are a part of human nature. Society does not form consciousness, instead, consciousness forms society: culture, ideas, habits etc. which arise from conscious decisions form society. Human beings create society, not the other way around. The evil in the world does not come from bad societal arrangements, it's part of human nature. Therefore evil cannot be eradicated. One cannot create neither a rational nor an unselfish society, because you would have to create rational and unselfish people first and that's impossible. What one can do instead is to give incentives: reward good, punish evil, tolerate selfishness that which is not evil. Usually one needs a direct feedback system: businessmen must be tested by markets, criminals by judges and so on. The result can never be perfect but sometimes it can be tolerably bad. This view of human nature is constrained: the _conditio_ _humana_ is a given fact, the way the human mind works is a given fact, you can only change so much.

&gt;I also disagree with the idea that egoism requires language or religion. We inherently value our own persons over that of others, and in an economy even more scarce that ours, we would value ourselves even more greatly.

Animal life does not value themselves over others. They tear off a resource and fight over it until the notion of consequence enters their head. Human life realizes such consequences, as do some forms of animal life, and it is human life which has a stronger control in managing themselves over consequence. Therefore, I think early peoples that start off before civilizations arise are naturally peaceful only when they are unlazy, and their first road to war begins with the lazy and unlazy.

&gt;You're looking at this backward. Laziness is not the natural state; rather, it is born out of a society of decadence which enables people to gain at little cost.

Try to describe such a society that is decadent when it does not have language and religion, from where only architecture, machinery, and therefore borders can be adequately composed. In such a society there is no decadence except to have more food than another. I do not think the decadent one would then turn to avarice to compound such bounty, because they have all that they need. No, I think the first situation would become the conflict between lazy and unlazy, not the decadent ego man over the weak ego man.

&gt;War is not something that you can just throw together, and laziness is not the only reason a group of people would need resources. The fact is, sometimes things just suck, and you don't get dinner. On an individual scale, that means you go and steal a banana from the fruit vendor. On a tribal one, you form a raiding party and steal the other tribe's cattle.

I addressed this in my paragraph on ""the lazy would not die"".

&gt;The problem is that this instinct sticks around even when we no longer need it. We have enough resources, which makes laziness possible and war unnecessary, but we still have that drive.

I think you are describing natural calamities that happen where even the unlazy must be forced to steal from others. Perhaps this is so, but the far easier and far more common occurrence would be the conflict between the lazy and unlazy, which would happen rapidly in such an early, primative society.

&gt;In reality, the lazy would die in a situation such as the one you construct.

Again, I tried to address this in my argument that the lazy would not die (in general).",1206903882,"locke is right - we need society to protect our selfish but weak selves and our property.","selfish but weak","selfish","but",FALSE,"selfish but weak","weak",NA,NA,1

"c0369eb","I would think that, because people are like that. Humans are like that, we view any hardship we go through as basically the worst type of hardship a person could undertake. Even if its untrue, there is a part of us that believes it is truly worse than someone elses... Thus, a preference for something other than what you went through because ""Oh man, that would've been so much better than (blank)""...

As an example, a person of neglect would say. ""At least your parents looked at you, or gave you emotion at all."" to a person who was verbally abused, or emotionally abused.

Just an example.

Secondly, You complicate things. People are honestly very simple. Understand the basic tenets of why people act, and what people desire, and you can understand anyone.

That is in and of itself, a chore one can only do by looking inward. Distilling the complications and the muddied view of our reality and you see that things are boiled down to one or two things.


Thirdly, No one is truly one hundred percent absorbed in themselves. They can be vain, and selfish, but that is a defensive mechanism isn't it? ""I must give myself the attention, others don't... I am more interesting than those other people anyways, why would I bother with them?""

It's a common refrain, but in the end it's just a way to convince ourselves that we don't need anyone else, while putting so much effort into ignoring the desire to be around others.

If you were truly fully absorbed in yourself, you wouldn't be on reddit commenting. 

And by saying ""Who want to do different things than I do anyway"" could be a self defensive way of saying. ""I am afraid of trying the new things with other people in case I fail, and make a fool of myself""

If that means annexing the middle east as the 51st state, so be it. (OK, that was my conservative dig for the day).  But seriously, with Oil extraction rates averaging 30% for a field, think of all the ""dead"" oil fields that new technology for extraction can revive.  And 30% is good by today's standards, imagine how low it must have been in the 20's, 30's and 40s'.  The amount of oil we have yet to extract is massive.

"ckxgf","A somewhat related problem occurs at the self-checkout kiosks. When they first came out, they were the best way to get out of the store quickly, for those that were competent enough to scan their own items quickly and efficiently. Not many people used them, and those that did were smart enough to know how to use them, and didn't take long.

But now, they're as bad as the checkouts. People with heaping buggies full of groceries use them (when they're clearly not designed for that purpose, since they only have a couple bag stands), and worse, they don't know how to use them, or they're slow. Or worse, they pay with cash, looking through their wallets for the right change. Eeegh!

Okay, so I'm impatient and selfish. But these things used to let me get out of the store quickly and efficiently. I wasn't in anyones way, or taking up a spot in the checkout line.

imo, places like this need ""fast lanes"" to allow those that know what they're doing and are willing to work efficently to get in and out quickly. I'm not saying some people have the right to get through the system quicker, but if they make the effort to do so and can be through the system in a fraction of the time it takes the majority, then why not? Isn't that a more efficient system that benefits everyone? Sure, it benefits the ""fast laners"" more, but since they're not clogging up the regular system, others will benefit too.",1159999671,"okay, so i'm impatient and selfish.","impatient and selfish","selfish",NA,FALSE,"impatient and selfish","impatient",NA,NA,0
