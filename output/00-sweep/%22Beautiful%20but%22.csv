This often lead s to abandon the partner or cheating on him. I know this hurts a lot. But there is as well a positive angle to look at this. I know your heart might be broken rightnow but you already faced this tendency yet and your wife did what happens often if  people married their first partner. Your wife had a let's call it ""trial"" and figured out that it's still you where her heart belongs.

Life isn't perfect but if you give her a chance you probably have atleast having a good partner to go through that imperfect live. If you descide to give her a chance feel free to explain her your gone if it should happen again as well feel free to taking your time on your own. If you give her a chance maybe go to a therapy with her. I know how it feels to get cheated on but on her side the boundary is still strong to you and at the end of the day/life boundaries counts more than the ""injured pride"".
Those who managed to get through this usually will be able to have even deeper boundaries after that.

Don't be afraid of liking something that isn't ""cool"". And don't be afraid of disliking something that is ""cool"".

Why should you stuff yourself full of salty licorice if you think it tastes really bad? It's the same with music.

Nowadays I mostly rely on Spotify, but in the past I've used Pandora and [Last.fm](https://Last.fm) to find new things.

Also, I'd recommend leaving your head out of it when you're exploring. Go with your gut. How does a given song make you feel? Is it interesting? Is it bland? Does it stick in your head once it's over?

I'll give you a couple of recommendations as jumping-off points. These are songs that I like. You might hate them or you may have no feelings whatsoever about them. If you like any of them, you can check out recommended videos (I'll be posting YouTube links).

Just think of it like someone offering you a snack. Either you like it, or you don't. It's as easy as that.

The Crane Zitherist suit is absolutely gorgeous, and the makeup is definitely one of my top favorite makeups in the game. The cranes are also giant and beautiful, but that‚Äôs about all I use. The water ripple item is very versatile but also very subtle. Also, the crane suit from Association is somewhat similar.

Aroma of Love Letter obviously has that giant flower orb that will be great for SC, and I like the phonograph with the golden butterflies. However, I hate the rest of the suit. It‚Äôs very big and triangle-ey. 

I personally vote for 2018 because: Crane Z is pretty but not a huge payoff for what you spend, and the only other suits in that lineup are suits you don‚Äôt like (and honestly, neither do I. The sitting pose of Beauty in Painting is sexy but I hardly use anything from that suit.)

In contrast, Aroma of Love Letter in 2018 has more versatile background items IMO. In addition, there are other great suits to get. I love the gold chain/spikes in Truth Seer and the black dog is useful too. Cold Red is a beautiful suit albeit less versatile, and the other two (magic kiss and panda brawler) have high scoring items as a consolation.

"fmrl5l5","The Fate Roleplaying Game has hands down the best way of coming up with these. 

In Fate, a character has 7 ‚ÄúAspects,‚Äù which are short, ideally snappy bits of description about a character that do two things:

1. When they would help a character, they can be tapped to give a bonus

2. When they would hinder a character, they generate narrative resources that can be used later. 

(Technically they do other things too, but none that are relevant to this exercise). 

So, for example, a beautiful but vain character might have ‚ÄúThe Fairest of them All‚Äù, which, sure helps them influence people and get attention, but gives them vicious instincts that make them unkindly disposed towards other attractive characters. 

The point: pick, as your characters core, fundamental aspects, traits that will both aid and hinder them. Give them flaws that sometimes prove useful, and positive traits that sometimes get them into trouble. 

Do this well, and characters will push themselves into trouble in very believable ways.",1586326601,"so, for example, a beautiful but vain character might have ‚Äúthe fairest of them all‚Äù, which, sure helps them influence people and get attention, but gives them vicious instincts that make them unkindly disposed towards other attractive characters.","beautiful but vain","beautiful","but",FALSE,"beautiful but vain","vain",NA,NA,1

I spotted the most beautiful but tarnished silver bowl and asked to buy it. As she was ringing me up, she suddenly asks if I know who my parents were, calling them by name, I'll call them Bob and Ellen for conversation sake.  

I was understandably confused and said that yes, I knew who Bob and Ellen were, thinking maybe this was a joke. The owner suddenly went on a tirade about how they were scum and dirtied the town's worth and blah blah blah you get the idea.

And then of course Daisy, there‚Äôs a lot of just reflection and regret, and then finally, as I graduated high school, Science Fiction came out, and it was so different yet the same. Everything refined and summed up, with more serious philosophical and real world issues in a more adult point of view and the fact that this would be the last album. Damn.

"fg6gol2","I'd say Germany would probably work great for you, either that or a few regions in eastern Austria, I've been UK-based for a while and Germany has become one of the top destinations for skilled young Britons amidst Brexit, even more so for you given your background and circumstances. Eastern Germany has amazing low cost of living given the quality of life there, in fact that's one of the big appeals of the country. The happy historical accident of recent reunification with east Germany has meant that the east of the country mainly remains incredibly affordable with low COL, even in the bigger cities like Berlin and Chemnitz, but still with the social benefits and the high quality of life measures that characterize the western part. And to be fair even most of western Germany is reasonably affordable especially compared to London and UK cities, it's only parts of southern Germany where COL becomes more big city UK or USA-like. I don't know quite as much about Austria but my understanding is, parts of eastern Austria are often some of the most beautiful but also low COL, in fact American and UK expats I know in Austria say the place is pretty affordable almost anywhere  outside Vienna and maybe Salzburg. I can't say I know so much about China or Taiwan but from trips I've had there, cost of living is very low and expats do very well there. Even with the current coronavirus scare (which has proven to be far less dangerous than the flu even in the worst case) it's probably got a lot of advantages if you're a Westerner with some Chinese ability , good jobs, high pay and good living. To my astonishment tbh, every expat I've talked to from China and Taiwan (plus Singapore but COL very high there) has loved it there and had positive things to say, apparently they're actually pretty free to do what they want in China so long as they don't do something really stupid like sell drugs. I just feel like as far as long term options ,Germany or Austria offer you the best balance with good opportunities for your training and low COL. As I understand, even some parts of central eastern Europe like in Slovakia, Hungary, Poland, Slovenia, Romania, even Latvia and the Baltics use German in some regions as a business language, it's some sort of official regional language in parts but I admit not knowing enough about that to really give sound advice, except that COL is even lower in those very beautiful countries.

As far as practical steps, as I've gathered it, you still have at least primary free movement rights through 2020 even though the UK is now officially out of the EU, so you might as well start the steps to get your passport. During the transition period lasting through this year, you can still travel visa-free throughout the EU and get paperwork in to get an EU passport and make a move. But even outside the EU, Germany is on a big skilled worker recruiting effort to fill skills shortages, so you'd do well even outside the EU. I used to work in America and throngs of Americans and Canadians are now coming to Germany under this scheme, plus the usual big movement of Russians and others on EU fringes. EU countries are actively moving to guarantee rights for you post-Brexit if you're coming from Britain. A few links,

"fg6cs7t","In this post we come up with our best tips and final thoughts about the Tour de Mont Blanc trail. For us it was very beautiful but challenging trail that required quite a bit of preparation. It is an amazing trail that allowed us to discover lots of scenic places. We are going to share what gear is better to take with you, what distance to make a day, the weather patterns you can meet, how to wild camp on this trail and the best season to hike it. Hope that you¬¥ll find some useful information in it. 

Some of our points are: 

\-TMB is challenging thus the good physical form is important

\-Go as lightweight as possible

\-Go well equipped: good boots and trekking poles are a must

\- Bring the warm clothes and raincoats as the weather can change very quickly and unpredictably

\- Weather forecasts are not precise

\-Best season to hike is from mid July to mid September

\-Be prepared for the snow

\- Wild camping rules are different in every country

\-The trail is breathtaking and one of the best high mountain treks to do

3.	 he's the best character in these movies, and so the fact that we can't get anymore stories with him redeemed makes me very angry, purely for wasted potential 
4.	Reylo could have been beautiful and satisfying to the be beginning of something new. Instead, it was a moment in time, in each of TLJ and TROS
5.	 The theme of all the OT trio failing is really well done, if their kids get to fix the mess they grew up in and create something beautiful. But instead the entire Skywalker line and the entire Solo line died out completely, with no satisfaction or anything like that

Even major plot points just kind of feel like elaborate plot points.

None of the quests feel important to the game and there's nothing compelling you to push forward in the story. Worse, most of the quests are merely killing mobs or fetch quests. One quest has you literally running across a map to fetch somebody's dinner for a date. I'm supposed to be the hero on an important mission... but let me take a break to make sure date night goes smoothly.

In the Fallout games at least I feel like I'm contributing to improving the wasteland. Outer Worlds lacks that because you keep bouncing around different worlds/maps. I don't feel like I'm really improving the overall status of things.

"f5rs7bd","song impressions:

1. cellophane still reigns supreme. it's the best track on the record and is (besides mary magdalene) the  centerpiece of the record. cellophane is my song of the year, and possibly my favorite twigs track across her released discography. 
2. fallen. alien. is. incredible. it's like nothing twigs has ever done. it's angry and manic in a way I've never heard from her; it's almost like she's on her way to physically fight an ex-lover. it's so theatrical and clearly comes from a place of rage. I still can't get over how interesting this track is. I need to stop myself from overplaying it. I am so happy she saved this song until the release, rather than playing it live. such an unexpected gem.
3. sad day doesn't hit as hard as I expected, but I am guessing that's because I am listening to the leaked version. still a good track and will definitely be a fan favorite. 
4. thousand eyes is beautiful but far too long without much reprieve from its own monotony. I wish it had a little bit of an explosion at the end akin to the production in the live interlude version. with that being said, her vocals are incredible and I still appreciate the track. 
5. daybed is one of my unexpected favorites. the production's nuances are phenomenal. it feels like it really fits into the album's thematic canon. you can really picture her sitting on her daybed, watching her world fall apart around her. it's like the eye of the storm.
6. mirrored heart is beautiful, but I wish they let the song breathe a little more. the song feels a little tense and rushed. still, it's beautiful and I can't stop repeating it. 
7. mary magdalene was the song I was most excited for. its instrumental intro was unexpected and beautiful. this song has some of the strongest lyrics on the record, in my opinion. the verses are lyrically incredible. production-wise, I wish it went off a little bit more. I wanted more explosion from the ending. still, this track is amazing. it's the kind of track that only twigs could pull off, and it feels so naturally ""her"". 
8. home with you was the other song I was most excited for based on what I heard at her MAGDALENE show in Brooklyn. it's not really a favorite among fans, but I truly love this track. the lyrics in the verses contain some of her best lyrics. the vocal effects are a little too strong but I trust that her intention with it suits what she wanted to convey with the song. I love the percussion in the second verse, they sound so empty yet so full? 
9. holy terrain gets the most hate, and while I prefer the live performance of it, I still really enjoy this track. I don't really find it to be basic; it feels so very twigs. the production feels a little empty to me (almost demo-like?), but I feel that way about quite a few of the songs on the record.

"f5rs3gq","general album impressions:

1. it's completely different from LP1, as expected. it's so cool to see her morph into a new version of herself, while still sounding completely true to who she is as an artist. I have a feeling every major release from her will sound completely different. her work ethic is incredible and she has so much innate and learned skill. she has really solidified herself as a formidable talent of our generation.
2. the emotional range to this record is impressive. even though there is a lot of pain she has endured, the record sounds hopeful at times. there's also a lot of anger, desperation, confidence and strength. it's easy to spot these emotions through her honesty and vulnerability. the tracks are accessible in a way those of LP1 weren't. I really enjoyed hearing anger and desperation from her in tracks like fallen alien, home with you (the verses feel very angry to me, which I love) and sad day (which seems manically desperate).
3. her vocal performance and lyrics are at the forefront for once, which is a nice change of pace for her music. I enjoy the prominence and heavy sound that LP1 provided, so this record is going to take some time for me to adjust to. at times, her vocals sound raw, as if they used the first vocal take from the demo, which bothers me. it's just an idiosyncrasy of my own taste that I have to get over!

"f48m18q","Good luck! I bred several species of mantis for a few years and they will also hold a special place in my heart. 

Orchid mantids are incredibly beautiful but rather finicky to care for, and their price reflects that despite being commonly bred in the hobby. Too much/too little humidity is a common cause of death resulting from bad molts. Their mortality rate is still fairly high even in ideal conditions. 

Their diets also require some consideration. Like most arboreal/flower mantids they need a diet low in chitin and gut bacteria, which means things like flies and moths. For the most nutrition fresh bee pollen is also ideal to dust the feeders as a supplement. Transitioning from pollen dusted fruit flies, to house flies, and finally blue bottle flies is enough to successfully rear them from first instar to adult. 

More common prey items like mealworms and crickets almost always result in eventual death, especially for sensitive species like orchid mantids, and it‚Äôs never pretty. They normally stop eating and throw up a foul black liquid before succumbing. They don‚Äôt handle excess chitin well and can become compacted. The large guts of crawling insects (especially if they‚Äôre not kept and bred in clean conditions) can also result in a large bacterial load. 

The short lifespan was the biggest turn off for me, and why I eventually stopped keeping them. Most species barely live 2-3 months into adulthood‚Äîhardly enough to enjoy them in their full glory. Keeping a species long term means pairing and breeding, but the nymphs require lots of care and constant upgrades in enclosure as they grow. 

After keeping 13 different species and breeding half of those in considerable numbers, I‚Äôd consider Phyllocrania paradoxa to be my favorite overall species.

"" Kyahahahaha!

In terms of raw power, straight lasers are simple, fast and effective. Curvy lasers take a while to reach their target as they're bending and twisting. Straight lasers are fast and can quickly knock any target out of the air. 

Clownpiece not only has lasers in her nonspells, but also her spellcards as well, most often using them to trap opponents between laser walls. If she used curved lasers, they'd be less effective boxing her opponents in. Not only that but due to her trapping method she can use other attacks in her arsenal, such as stars and fire, to decimate her opponents while they're being overwhelmed by her giant straight lasers.

Fun fact that isn't really related: lasers in Touhou are actually clusters of bullets put together to look like lasers. I can't remember specifically what bullets are used though but I know Clownpiece uses slightly different bullets for her lasers than most other Touhous. Because of that her lasers are bigger and have weirder hitboxes.

Clownpiece, unlike Shou, makes full use of her lasers to either trap the player or hit them straight out the sky. Shou's lasers, while beautiful and can be used to catch opponents off guard, end up not being fully utilized as many don't even go in the players general direction. Curvy lasers may be beautiful but straight lasers have raw power.

Well, first off, I‚Äôm happy you heard of us and that you are going to come explore our region! There  are a few places that are really worth seeing, two of them are part of UNESCO World Heritage as well:

1) Portofino: small village in a little bay, really famous and beautiful but expensive af since many celebrities from around the world go there.
2) Cinque Terre: a conglomerate of 5 small villages all built on cliffs above the sea. Beautiful and rather unique.
3) Genova: the biggest city in Liguria, ancient and full of history from the Romans to the modern times through our Medieval Republic. Some attractions are the Aquarium (biggest in Europe), the historic harbour and the Doge Palace (we had a Doge like Venice since we too were a ‚ÄúRepubblica Marinara‚Äù).
4) San Remo: another city, quite famous for its flowers and the national music festival that is held there every year.
5) Our Inland: there are a number of small and beautiful (and quite wild as well) valleys just behind the first range of mountains that divide the coast from the inland. I recommend the Val D‚ÄôAveto, it‚Äôs beautiful and it can offer some respite from the higher temperatures that we usually have on the coast during summer.
6) Sestri Levante: a beautiful, historical and breathtaking village built in between two bays, home of the Baia del Silenzio (Bay of Silence) one of the most famous beaches in Italy.
7) Levanto: another small and touristic village.
8) Anyone of the many ‚ÄúSagra‚Äù that are organised during summer, it‚Äôs basically a festival in which a certain specific regional and typical food is made by locals for a much cheaper price and you get to experience a little of Italian culture as well (mostly drunk people üòÖ).
9) Apericena: it‚Äôs similar to the happy hour, many Italians love it (I do üòä), you can buy some low alcoholic drink or some wine and you will get a buffet of food, usually both cold and warm recipes. 
10)One of the many famous beaches of our region.
11) As another commenter wrote, Cervo, Tellaro and Abbazia di San Fruttuoso are all very nice places.
12) Cristo degli Abissi (Christ of the Abiss): this is a really interesting attraction. It‚Äôs an underwater statue (12 m under the sea level) made from pieces of WW2 artillery. It‚Äôs in the bay of San Fruttuoso, there are many boats that can take you there and rent scuba diving suits and accessories.

Please be aware that unfortunately in August it will be really hot (35-40 C from 8 am until 9 pm) so you will want to spend most of the day either on the beach or inside some museum, it will also be overcrowded with tourists so everything will be more difficult (parking, finding a spot on the beach, reserving a spot in restaurants, etc.) and finally, the prices are quite high since our is a touristic region. With all that said I strongly recommend to visit either Portofino or Cinque Terre and to visit Genova to witness our history.

"exy0b8w","ah, i am happily reminded of this;

""In this world there is room for everyone 
and the earth is rich and can provide for everyone 
The way of life can be free and beautiful 
But we have lost the way 
Greed has poisoned men's souls 
Has barricaded the world with hate 
Has goose-stepped us into misery and bloodshed
We have developed speed but we have shut ourselves in 
Machinery that gives abundance has left us in want
Our knowledge has made us cynical 
Our cleverness hard and unkind
We think too much and feel too little 
More than machinery we need humanity
More than cleverness we need kindness and gentleness 
Without these qualities life will be violent and all will be lost
The airplane and the radio have brought us closer together
The very nature of these inventions cries out for the goodness in men
Cries out for universal brotherhood for the unity of us all
Even now my voice is reaching millions throughout the world
Millions of despairing men, women and little children
Victims of a system that makes men torture and imprison innocent people
To those who can hear me I say ""Do not despair""
The misery that is now upon us is but the passing of greed
The bitterness of men who fear the way of human progress
The hate of men will pass and dictators die 
And the power they took from the people will return to the people 
And so long as men die [now] liberty will never perish‚Ä¶
Soldiers, don't give yourselves to brutes
Men who despise you and enslave you, who regiment your lives
Tell you what to do, what to think and what to feel
Who drill you, diet you, treat you like cattle, use you as cannon fodder
Don't give yourselves to these unnatural men, machine men
With machine minds and machine hearts
You are not machines
You are not cattle
You are men
You have the love of humanity in your hearts
You don't hate, only the unloved hate
Only the unloved and the unnatural
Soldiers, don't fight for slavery, fight for liberty
In the seventeenth chapter of Saint Luke it is written 
The kingdom of God is within man 
Not one man, nor a group of men, but in all men, in you
You the people have the power""",1566645442,"ah, i am happily reminded of this;  ""in this world there is room for everyone  and the earth is rich and can provide for everyone  the way of life can be free and beautiful  but we have lost the way  greed has poisoned men's souls  has barricaded the world with hate  has goose-stepped us into misery and bloodshed we have developed speed but we have shut ourselves in  machinery that gives abundance has left us in want our knowledge has made us cynical  our cleverness hard and unkind we think too much and feel too little  more than machinery we need humanity more than cleverness we need kindness and gentleness  without these qualities life will be violent and all will be lost the airplane and the radio have brought us closer together the very nature of these inventions cries out for the goodness in men cries out for universal brotherhood for the unity of us all even now my voice is reaching millions throughout the world millions of despairing men, women and little children victims of a system that makes men torture and imprison innocent people to those who can hear me i say ""do not despair"" the misery that is now upon us is but the passing of greed the bitterness of men who fear the way of human progress the hate of men will pass and dictators die  and the power they took from the people will return to the people  and so long as men die [now] liberty will never perish‚Ä¶ soldiers, don't give yourselves to brutes men who despise you and enslave you, who regiment your lives tell you what to do, what to think and what to feel who drill you, diet you, treat you like cattle, use you as cannon fodder don't give yourselves to these unnatural men, machine men with machine minds and machine hearts you are not machines you are not cattle you are men you have the love of humanity in your hearts you don't hate, only the unloved hate only the unloved and the unnatural soldiers, don't fight for slavery, fight for liberty in the seventeenth chapter of saint luke it is written  the kingdom of god is within man  not one man, nor a group of men, but in all men, in you you the people have the power""","free and beautiful","beautiful",NA,FALSE,"free and beautiful","free",NA,NA,0

I worked at the city centre, so I was quite fed up with the constant crowding of tourists, but if you don't live/work there, Prague is just like any other city.

As for which one I like more - that is difficult to say. Both cities have their own character and provide a very different experience.

As a former student in Brno, I imagine you know how it goes here. The city is small, compact, easy to get around, with a student and bar/pub centric, relaxed atmosphere.

Prague, as I said, can be a lot of things, depending on your location. The city centre is beautiful, but overcrowded with tourists - while still enjoyable, it doesn't provide the relaxed culture of Brno. Prague, apart from tourism, doesn't have an overarching feel, like Brno has with being a student city - it has everything, but the social groups cancel each other out, giving the city an overall more universal feel.

Prague, however, has better parks - which I appreciate a lot, even though they could still use many more of them and obviously, there are better job opportunities. The sunsets above the river are some of the most beautiful sights I have ever seen.

In fact, reading the texts of many different faiths has enriched my overall understanding of the Bible/Upanishads/Kybalion/etc. and I'm sure it would do for you as well. In my opinion Buddhism's spiritually scientific nature provides a good framework for learning about some of the more esoteric practices that just seem like nonsense to the untrained eye. I'm sure later on down the line you'll have a re-read of the bible with a fresh and newly educated perspective that will yield some new understanding. I always love reading posts like this because despite the strange novelty I'm sure you're experiencing from this lifestyle change it's ultimately the start of something not only beautiful but helpful and applicable to your daily life.

The Corona, on the other hand, has that smooth action that made SC portables so popular for so long. My flattop feels so much like my later Sterling and Silent, that it's obvious the company stuck to the ""if it ain't broke, don't fix it"" motto when it comes to the basic typing mechanism.

That Falco/Colt scene was heart-wrenching.
Porco death... I was kinda expecting him to die somewhere along the road and I was with ""Porco'll sacrifice himself to Falco to save Reiner"" theory and yet... that was still... unexpected.
THAT memory, the one Reiner didn't want him to see really did a number on him. The interesting thing is he didn't find that memory by himself, Reiner, touching Eren, transmitted it to him!
Did Reiner involuntary killed Porco or did Eren incited Porco to die or did Porco inconsciously snatched that memory he was running after for so long frome Reiner?
That was a strange ending for him. Sad and beautiful. 
But I think there is something deeper in it. Three Jaw Titans consecutively dying for Reiner. It can't be a coincidence. It's like the paths don't want him to die yet.
Another interesting point is Zeke ordering titan Falco to kill Reiner, specifically. Maybe I read too much into it but...",1562315631,"sad and beautiful.","sad and beautiful","beautiful",NA,FALSE,"sad and beautiful","sad",NA,NA,0
"eswhqud","Things to do in Colombia

  
Coffee region ‚Äî Salento and Corcora valley are beautiful!! A bit touristy, can probably find a town or farm nearby to spend some time if you want something less touristy  
Play tejo! It‚Äôs similar to cornhole except it involves gunpowder and explosions. There‚Äôs a good touristy/beginner friendly place to try it in Salento but also try it elsewhere and see the difference!  
Medellin

* do the comuna 13 free walking tour. It‚Äôs Pablo Escobar‚Äôs old neighborhood and used to be one of the most dangerous neighborhoods in the world. The tours are done by locals who lived through it, and you‚Äôll hear the real story of how it became safe again, not the white washed version you‚Äôll hear elsewhere
* Museo casa de la memoria- museum about the conflict/violent history of Medellin. Incredibly sad but amazing, honestly the best museum I‚Äôve ever been to
* Take the cable cars over the city! You can get one of them right from the metro stop for comuna 13
* Guatape is a 3 hr bus ride from Medellin. Incredibly beautiful and unique landscape (and the bus ride is beautiful too). Some people go as a day trip but don‚Äôt! Go for at least two days, climb la piedra, go kayaking on the water, plus some nice hikes

I didn‚Äôt go to Leticia (the Amazon) but I regret it! Heard it was unbelievable. You need to fly there, tickets are cheaper if you book a bit in advance  
San Gil - beautiful small colonial city with tons of adventure sports. Do the white water rafting!!! Super fun, and the company that runs it is the Colombian National rafting team ‚Äî they‚Äôre your guides in the rafts with you. Paragliding over Colombia biggest canyon is also extremely beautiful and worth it. Also take a collectivo to Barichara, a beautiful colonial town nearby. Try hormigas culonas (fat assed ants! Local delicacy) (buy them in barichara bc in San Gil they‚Äôre way overpriced for tourists). Check out the views and the cemetery, then if you want walk 3 miles to Guane, a smaller colonial town. Not a ton to see but a nice walk

  
Cartagena - HOT and HUMID. Don‚Äôt need more than a few days here. Right outside the old walled part of the city there‚Äôs a park with wild monkeys, sloths, and iguanas! Plaza Trinidad is lively at night and a great place to drink beer and meet friends. There are some islands near Cartagena that are supposed to be lovely off the coast but I didn‚Äôt go. I did go to Playa Blanca ‚Äî gorgeous water (7 shades of blue), insanely crowded during the day. If you go plan to stay overnight: the crowds clear out around 3pm and then it‚Äôs much nicer. There are very basic hostels along the beach. When you get to the beach walk RIGHT not LEFT (left is the most insanely crowded beach I‚Äôve ever seen in my life, plus the hostels are to the right). At night you can pay for a cheap boat ride to take you to swim with bioluminescent plankton. SO COOL!!!! Definitely do this!!!! Also bring your own booze as the booze on the beach is incredibly overpriced. We also brought our own food and made sandwiches ‚Äîfood on the beach is pricey and not very good

  
Santa Marta - hot af, but a good place to base yourself out of to do things nearby on the coast

* Tyrona/taganga‚Äî these parks were closed for maintenance when I was here but they‚Äôre supposed to be lovely and good for hiking
* Camerones‚Äîask at your hostel about a day trip to see the flamingos in camerones. This is a bit off the beaten path but absolutely incredible. Camerones is a tiny indigenous village on the ocean that makes its money selling shrimp and taking tourists for boat rides to see flamingos. Even during high season we were the ONLY tourists there, and no other tourists we met had heard of it. The boat we went out on was 90 years old, made from a single tree, and used old rice sacks for a sail. Absolutely amazing and you‚Äôll be supporting a community that definitely needs it
* Lost city trek (la ciudad perdida) - four day trek through the jungle to ruins. Can‚Äôt go on your own, needs to be a guided group tour. Beautiful but HOT and pretty difficult. I enjoyed it but thought it was a bit pricey for what it was. Looking back I might have skipped it, but made some good friends doing it, and I‚Äôve spoken to others who said it was the highlight of their trip

Good book about Colombia: Short Walks From Bogota ‚Äî about the history and conflict in Colombia. Incredibly sad and fascinating, and the author points out a lot of things you otherwise might have missed. Really helped me feel like I got to know the country and gave a lot of context for things I was seeing

I would suggest two things : 

A, Don't rely on reps. they can help but you alone have to get on the hustle. You need to drag stuff to them that can leverage the meetings you want, and shows them you are not to be fucked with. 

B, More importantly what else can you do. Can you Direct, Compose or Produce. These days if you can do two of the key jobs you are one step ahead. Producing and Directing neither are hard, especially directing that's just being able to coral chaos (I've been a DGA Director for 12 years) Producing is harder but even better because if you can show theres a roadmap to getting it done a lot will fall into place quicker than you expected.

You have the talent, don't doubt it especially as you are so close. One thing that stood out for me in your post  those people who said they wanted you but didn't make it happen. They didn't fight hard enough. What's the reason ? figure that out and what do you need to do to prove to them that they need to go to bat for you, and be willing to stake there reputation on it.

However, I also get the concept of economy, which is where this conversation is going wrong a bit.

Currency needs to move to keep any economy alive. If it's not moving, the marketplace dies. This is what we were heading towards before player vending.

It also needs to be non-punitive to do this. Spenders will accept a convenience cost up to a certain amount, and after that they will stop spending.

Player vending provided a great way for us to get rid of our caps, and I would point out that it introduced another caps sink - the 10% cut. I'd hate to see it underutilised because of prohibative costs to visit beautiful but remote camps.

An example: Camps on the far left of the map. There are amazing locations there to build, but I'll never see those camps because I exclusively hunt the right hand side, and I'm not paying 50 caps FT fees to find that someone is selling Marine Helmets at 1000 caps each.

As for Azor Ahai, I don't understand why everyone is so caught up in the specifics like what was the magic sword and why didn't Jon kill the Night King personally. The show never presents the specifics of the story as more than a myth. Why would the specifics even be known in Ashai more accurately than in Westeros? Oh he made a magic sword, okay was it a magic bronze sword because the first men wouldn't get steel for like another 2000 years. Was it dragonglass? why he spend 100 days making a dragonglass sword when mass produced dragonglass daggers could have done the job? 

Meanwhile in Westeros there is a magical 300 mile long 700 foot tall ice wall left behind as evidence of what actually happened during this pre historical time. And we learn it was the children who started this, and strongly suggested the children who helped end the first long night and have magic that could help build a magic ice wall. 

Now it wouldn't be weird for other cultures to have their own long night stories, and you can add a lot of details to those stories over 8000 years and forget what was true and what wasn't. The Lord of Light certainly was real to a degree and in that sense Jon was a chosen one, without him you don't get enough people to unite to make a stand that had a chance of working. He even has a magic sword, but its one that couldn't have existed 8000 years ago, and a handful of others had swords just as magical. And I just don't understand why Game of Thrones ever held appeal past season 1 episode 9 to someone who was going to be so upset that Jon didn't get to go one on one with the night king and defeat him.

Arya killed enough people for me to be satisfied she got all the eye colors. I'm not going to stress out about them not using super obvious contact lenses to hammer this down our throats. Littlefinger, Frey and the Night King is a solid top 3, if they gave Littlefinger super obvious green eyes you probably also would have had to give Dany purple eyes which sounds fine reading it, and probably would have looked weird for the last 9 years.",1558488634,"""cersei's fate: yes all of her children died.. but she was never replaced by a younger and more beautiful queen(bran is beautiful but definitely not a queen) and she wasn't killed by her younger brother.""","beautiful but definitely","beautiful","but",FALSE,"young and more beautiful","young","more",NA,0

"emjpy5f","I'm sorry, but I don't want to be an emperor. That's not my business. I don't want to rule or conquer anyone. I should like to help everyone if possible; Jew, Gentile, black man, white. We all want to help one another. Human beings are like that. We want to live by each other's happiness, not by each other's misery. We don't want to hate and despise one another. In this world there is room for everyone, and the good earth is rich and can provide for everyone. The way of life can be free and beautiful, but we have lost the way. Greed has poisoned men's souls, has barricaded the world with hate, has goose-stepped us into misery and bloodshed. We have developed speed, but we have shut ourselves in. Machinery that gives abundance has left us in want. Our knowledge has made us cynical; our cleverness, hard and unkind. We think too much and feel too little. More than machinery, we need humanity. More than cleverness, we need kindness and gentleness. Without these qualities, life will be violent and all will be lost. The airplane and the radio have brought us closer together. The very nature of these inventions cries out for the goodness in men; cries out for universal brotherhood; for the unity of us all. Even now my voice is reaching millions throughout the world, millions of despairing men, women, and little children, victims of a system that makes men torture and imprison innocent people. To those who can hear me, I say, do not despair. The misery that is now upon us is but the passing of greed, the bitterness of men who fear the way of human progress. The hate of men will pass, and dictators die, and the power they took from the people will return to the people. And so long as men die, liberty will never perish. Soldiers! Don't give yourselves to brutes, men who despise you, enslave you; who regiment your lives, tell you what to do, what to think and what to feel! Who drill you, diet you, treat you like cattle, use you as cannon fodder. Don't give yourselves to these unnatural men - machine men with machine minds and machine hearts! You are not machines, you are not cattle, you are men! You have the love of humanity in your hearts! You don't hate! Only the unloved hate; the unloved and the unnatural. Soldiers! Don't fight for slavery! Fight for liberty! In the seventeenth chapter of St. Luke, it is written that the kingdom of God is within man, not one man nor a group of men, but in all men! In you! You, the people, have the power, the power to create machines, the power to create happiness! You, the people, have the power to make this life free and beautiful, to make this life a wonderful adventure. Then in the name of democracy, let us use that power. Let us all unite. Let us fight for a new world, a decent world that will give men a chance to work, that will give youth a future and old age a security. By the promise of these things, brutes have risen to power. But they lie! They do not fulfill that promise. They never will! Dictators free themselves but they enslave the people. Now let us fight to fulfill that promise. Let us fight to free the world! To do away with national barriers! To do away with greed, with hate and intolerance! Let us fight for a world of reason, a world where science and progress will lead to all men's happiness. Soldiers, in the name of democracy, let us all unite!

Story WIP (needs proof reading)

**Generic Island Castaway** / \*\*Otoyomegatari (\*\****A Bride's Story*** **)**

Juan-a-jump #5X?

&amp;#x200B;

The Shisha was too Good that time because we all went home to our wives explaining a trade we made as brothers, Enchanted animal charm earrings for Alchemy and Enchanted Body Tattoos,

&amp;#x200B;

Shiva explained to Her sister men are beautiful but silly animals, not unlike Roosters,

(they Got Rooster earrings)

&amp;#x200B;

Blossom discussed with Sue Storm, how wise and sensible Tim normally was , like a raptor

(they got a mixture of birds of prey, hawks, vultures, falcons as earrings)

&amp;#x200B;

The Crobats however discussed getting tattoos and earrings describing Tim as the perfect mate,

for his gift guiding his house as well as the houses of others,

(they had Bat and Pheasant Earrings)

&amp;#x200B;

Mai and Hermione Granger Discussed the whole matter the next morning saying the men can be so silly and was thankful their men were more occupied 

(their earring were of various Crows and magpies)

&amp;#x200B;

Calftaurs wife alongside the other young women from central Asia only asked their men if it would make them better wives and companions, the answer always returned yes.

&amp;#x200B;

so the girls abandoned their work too tattoo all the ladies in the village and  *U*rabrask the Hidden did all the willing men, all  *Urabrask* asked was the augmented arms.

&amp;#x200B;

by night fall half the people were a tattooed, not only making them more beautiful but healthier, wiser and stronger, the rest were done on the following days.

&amp;#x200B;

We asked what they used and found a notably precious or magical varieties from our collection, and asked them if it would offensive to use the substance in the mizture, they kindly complied.

&amp;#x200B;

soon all the girls had earrings with a bizarre enhancement often making them wiser and more sensible, but frequently also enhancing their looks

&amp;#x200B;

 

about 5 months in Tim discussed Vampires with the tribe re-framing them as creatures hungry for magic or blood that were weak against oaths, beautiful and noble bu occasionally used by the lesser powers some one asked like Dijinn and tim added the subtle difference into his story...they loved it!

&amp;#x200B;

about the 7th month our friends from the tribe slowly tricked us into an oaths, the girls often had something to do with embroidery but occasionally it was to reveal a deep truth via the art form, my favorite was when they asked about our master to Shiva she used her gift of   *embroidery* to craft a  picture of Galadriel of Lothl√≥rien.

and the universal symbols for nice but scary, also maternal...one night they piece of embroidery disappeared..(we saw it again but on a certain Goddess..she thanked Shiva it was sweet)

 

&amp;#x200B;

They tricked the men into an oath about telling the stories of our tales and so somehow every night,

Juan, Tim, Calftaur, Urabrask and Jack 

gave their interpretation of our adventures and Jumps the favorites (besides Jack who told the story like an old preacher man), were Jumps 14, 19, 8, The Gauntlets and Episode we Educated a town or a people group,

&amp;#x200B;

The unpopular stores were involved, the silliness of Raising Team B.R.A.S, and animal human Hybrids it made them uncomfortable in the strangest ways...

&amp;#x200B;

about a month before all the births which had coordinated into about 7 days of perpetual births,

we had Urabrask the Hidden and Hermione Granger do what they could to prepare but it was going to be crazy!,

&amp;#x200B;

The whole tribe came to us at midnight and said we know your magical vampires, we were curious were this would go, then they said it we wish to be your thralls for you are to us as family and they bowed,

Shiva and Tim went forward saying 

""DONE!""

""THE RITUAL HAS BEGUN!""

&amp;#x200B;

We explained the pro and cons and then began the ritual the earring were enough for the first part, Then we insisted that we Just continue as usual

about a day before the births the tribe was a pack of magical vampires this certainly bound us together like never before. 

&amp;#x200B;

then came the children thankfully Urabrask the Hidden and Hermione Granger was last and a day late. but the tribe expanded to from 700 to approximately 1050, I also recommended the girls take the contraceptive they said all said no and surely enough in about 18 months we were at it again smoking shisha to celebrate everyone second child,

(The next gift was nose rings for more tattoos that buffed their  gifts of vampire )

&amp;#x200B;

Shiva explained to Her sister as she cooed over her gravid form are you certain the Jumper is lovely but...you know be safe...

(They Both Got  Nose rings)

&amp;#x200B;

Blossum discussed with Sue Storm,

marriage, relationships the normal stuff

(They got Nose Rings even though they Weren't pregnant)

&amp;#x200B;

The Crobats wanted to get tattoos just like the tribe and discussed with juvenile of bat girls being vampire bat girls...even Tim found this both juvenile and cute...he decided to bless them with another gift as well

(they got nose rings, vampire tattoos, vampirism and Tim's gift)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Mai and Hermione Granger gravid forms lightly pregnant considered this motherhood thing commenting on how it does make them hotter and their husbands love it! they would giggle but as they both were ladies they merely sipped tea with that look...

(They get nose rings too)

&amp;#x200B;

Calftaurs wife alongside the other young women from central Asia only asked their men if they enjoyed their old tattoos and vampiric gifts, it was a good time..for all...

&amp;#x200B;

.... this cycle went on for years by the end approximate, 5 cycles (7 years and 6 months later)

&amp;#x200B;

all the women were beautiful and vaguely middle aged,

wore only jewelry and headscarves giving up on shoes for rings and chains most with a small swarm of younger vampires beside them, and as soon as a girl reaches 19 she gets her first tattoo and considers her male vampiric suitors.

&amp;#x200B;

This included Crobats and shiva's sister and even   Mai and Hermione Granger who tried to embrace both their native culture and this central Asian culture making them very much the Englishmen and Turkish traders of their homeland...

 

The best way to count time beyond that is population over time as we were on that land for about 120/140 blessed years (93 cycles) and our tribe of 700 became a Large towns worth of 97,000 vampires and one exhausted wind-fish from the creatures sucking the magic out of the air.

&amp;#x200B;

the girls kept their children 10 vampires, divided evenly between the four women, in true jumper-fashion maternity and paternity were vague so we just claimed they were all ours.

&amp;#x200B;

a certain content English woman started at her husband and said don't be stranger...",1551765600,"&amp;#x200b;  the shisha was too good that time because we all went home to our wives explaining a trade we made as brothers, enchanted animal charm earrings for alchemy and enchanted body tattoos,  &amp;#x200b;  shiva explained to her sister men are beautiful but silly animals, not unlike roosters,  (they got rooster earrings)  &amp;#x200b;  blossom discussed with sue storm, how wise and sensible tim normally was , like a raptor  (they got a mixture of birds of prey, hawks, vultures, falcons as earrings)  &amp;#x200b;  the crobats however discussed getting tattoos and earrings describing tim as the perfect mate,  for his gift guiding his house as well as the houses of others,  (they had bat and pheasant earrings)  &amp;#x200b;  mai and hermione granger discussed the whole matter the next morning saying the men can be so silly and was thankful their men were more occupied   (their earring were of various crows and magpies)  &amp;#x200b;  calftaurs wife alongside the other young women from central asia only asked their men if it would make them better wives and companions, the answer always returned yes.  &amp;#x200b;  so the girls abandoned their work too tattoo all the ladies in the village and  *u*rabrask the hidden did all the willing men, all  *urabrask* asked was the augmented arms.  &amp;#x200b;  by night fall half the people were a tattooed, not only making them more beautiful but healthier, wiser and stronger, the rest were done on the following days.  &amp;#x200b;  we asked what they used and found a notably precious or magical varieties from our collection, and asked them if it would offensive to use the substance in the mizture, they kindly complied.  &amp;#x200b;  soon all the girls had earrings with a bizarre enhancement often making them wiser and more sensible, but frequently also enhancing their looks  &amp;#x200b;     about 5 months in tim discussed vampires with the tribe re-framing them as creatures hungry for magic or blood that were weak against oaths, beautiful and noble bu occasionally used by the lesser powers some one asked like dijinn and tim added the subtle difference into his story...they loved it!","beautiful but silly","beautiful","but",FALSE,"beautiful but silly","silly",NA,NA,1

"eglj1jg","Belated guests were not too late ‚Äî they had arrived as soon as Celtigar to the capital in time, but was it sufficient enough just to be there physically? They had to be prepared for it mentally either. Clair, despite her pertness, still felt she wasn't ready for Visery's coronation  day to be seen by all and applied to her skin one cream over another to give her skin the ""captivating"" whiteness and gloss, however her daughter stepped in and told her it was not worth for her to hide natural beauty, attempting this way to avoid seeing her mother im a role of a floured from head to feet miller.  After long arguing with shy Cornelia and soon joined Lance, a sharp eyed expert at esthetics supported his sister, she couldn't have resisted asks of both, at the end agreeing with them to apply just glossy cream that gave her moon's shine that was graceful. While women were doing their girly things, boys felt obligated to prepare themselves for tourneys and  fighting for position at Kingsguard, once commanded by Ser Ryam Redwyne, their ancestor and Arbor's national hero. Truly, only Lance wanted to achieve this honoring as he thought position, while Regulus knew it was not destined for him nor his brother, at least the one that was able to be won in tourney ‚Äî it passed already, they were too late for it. But he never minded practicing fencing, especially when his brother was motivated to knock out anyone on his way to his goal of fame and even use ""illegal"" moved his elder brothers taught him. Regulus was jealous of it but never admitted to be finding Medwin or Landon *too* cool ‚Äî they were ones that could have ruled Ryamsport and The Arbor, unlike him, the youngest boy in the heritage line he was acquainted with well even in his years, as with other politics adults often talked about what he tried to comprehend well. Soon they were ready to see Red Keep, the place where most of the children will live in for few years as wards. 

 Next day they were all ready to set out in the following group:

Lady Clair Redwyne, woman of age around thirty years old, elegant but muscular, with ginger hair distinctive for Arbor and green eyes that shine like emeralds in light and add to her mysterious look. Outfit of thick fabric and unique style enhanced that distinctiveness  of Moon Lady.

Lance was the tallest among young ones, for twelve years old he was of impressive height, blue eyed and blonde haired. Towering height was doing magic with clothes he putted on, allowing him to show  Arbor artisans sown patterns for his long pants and doublet. 

Regulus Redwyne was broad but short, the youngest of all but the one holding himself best in public ‚Äî having that visible nature of a leader, if he only learnt few predisposing people to him gestures, he could have, perhaps, to competed with Cornelia's charm at some point. 

Cornelia, speaking of her, was a girl of eight years old. Fair haired and, interestingly, her eyes were of mixture of green and honey, colors gifted to her by each of her parents. She was the one being merry as no one, ""smiling broadly"" just with her eyes, while slightly raised corners of lips expressed joyous mood far better than fully revealed teeth of anyone in Essos and Westeros combined. These chubby cheeks on her happy face asked themselves to be raised up, to show full smile. 

Ornella, the girl Viserys could have noticed in castle's halls, has stood calmly beside her mother in a beautiful but plain dress that was different completely from outfits what other Redwynes wore. She looked less confident and pity, but trying to please her family and show her best in front of King at his special day.


"" There is no better gift for King than what he cannot have. "" wisely remarked Regulus, hoping he intrigued Viserys instead of finding out about his arrogance that kid's brother shared. 

"" Odes are known across the steppes of Arbor, of Aegon The Conquror, the King who guested at the lands of drink and lavish feasts. "" poetically spoke Lance, hopefully letting Viserys imagine The Arbor's landscape.

"" Where one finds beauty of the nature, where one's love is ardent, where one is warmed by the smiling sunshine ."" voice of Cornelia was sweet and she enjoyed presenting the gift with her brothers and sisters, with her family.

"" There is life any King may be jealous of, in peaceful lands, with glass of vintage wine and with the scenic views on crystal waters and the valleys full of vineyards. "" the not so beautiful looking Ornella has changed with the words said, appearing to be little bit more attractive and inspired to be part of her family. 

"" That's why we present you gift for your lifetime ‚Äî Coronata, one of the ancient estates at Sansretour Valley. Local vineyards are the center of world wine production, renown for making the best vintages. "" proclaimed solemnly Clair, however not expecting Viserys to truly esteem the gift ‚Äî he wasn't living at Toussaint to know the degree of honor of owning one of the famous vineyards and he didn't know how the estate looked and what scenic lands surrounded it.

 Do I need friends to have fun? : Anything is more fun with friends, SC is no exeption.

 How is the world? : Beautiful but poor variety on the content. Deliverie missions makes you visit a lot of places that are very similar to do the same thing: travel to package's destination, land on the planet/station and grab package, place it in your ship, travel, deliver the package to its destination in the exact samy way as you retrieve it.

 How does it play?: FPS are easy to understand as it follows the same control scheme like every FPS game out there. Ship's controls are more time-requiring to master them. There is one practice mode that will cover the basics but fighting another player is always more difficult than the AI.

 Is this the game? : Never played ED but I do all ME series (even Andromeda...) and... FPS combat is light-years away from ME but you won't feel the combat was made with a low budget. Weapons had a decent firepower-feedback and bullet impact can make a pretty party with all the debris flying around.

&amp;#x200B;

 What is a good way to enter the game? Buy a package with access to the PU (single player campaing will come first and it looks like rather good but I'll leave that decision to you...) at a starter level (don't get crazy purchasing big ships). With an Aurora/Mustang you can check for yourself almost everything the game has to offer right now (besides mining) and THEN upgrade your ship to a better/bigger one.

I use to wear many hats, but nowadays I work for an underground syndicate that loans out a variety of things.  Anything you can think of... money, equipment... people.  It's not exactly what I had hoped for after the 10 Years War had ended, but people of my expertise have minimal use in times of peace.  

My desire to fight for my homeland and the honor I once had has devolved into something of a shadow of its former self.  Now I hunt and collect from the desperate.  Sometimes what I collect is of monetary value, other times it's collected in blood.  

A notification came down from one of the under-bosses regarding a magical 'kit' loaned to a sorceress that was suppose to return the merchandise as well as the payment three days ago.  In the Grand Duchy of Sorensol, those particular skills are put to the test as Sorensol is one of the most renown cities of magical arts in all of the known world.  Recovering debt from a store owner or some low life is one thing.  Doing so against a mage of any kind is a whole other can of worms.  

It just so happens that I like to go fishing.

I unfurled the scroll and scanned over the contract.

A few days have passed since I began kicking over stones to find out where the mark was located.  She was smart to leave the city.  The lowlifes in the underbelly of the city would have sold her out in a heartbeat.  It took a bit of greasing some palms for the locals out in the mountains, but the hut Marlissa was staying at was easy enough to find.  

The Ebony Mountains were vast and beautiful... but very dangerous.  The name of the land is aptly so as the canopy of the lush green trees were typically covered in snow, but greatly limited any light even during the day.  The darkened floor of the forest is even more treacherous as the bark of the trees themselves were dark as the night itself. It was the ideal setting for natural predators to ambush unsuspecting prey.  

I drew closer to the hut that was faintly illuminated by a few threads of light that managed the pierce the thick brush above.  A lone candle could be seen flickering in the window from my vantage point.  The hut seemed unassuming enough, but it was probably that kind of thinking that got the other hunters roasted alive.  

I placed my ocular-scope over my right eye and began to scan for different magical entities.  It was the latest model that was able to differentiate everything from conjurations to illusion spells.  My muscles tensed up and my body went straight into action.  

As soon as the lens switched to the illusion indicator, Marlissa fired a massive fireball into the tree I was hiding in.  I was able to jump from the tree unscathed, but was met with another intense volley of fire.  It was no wonder those other guys were beaten.  She was no ordinary sorceress.  Typically a mage is prone to physical attacks during incantation, however, she seemed skilled at non-verbal spells using quick hand gestures to create the next attack.

As the volley grew closer, I reached for my weapons and pulled them from their sheaths.  Like most mercenaries, I used two daggers, but not just any ordinary dagger.   They were specially made out of orichalcum and had a high resonating capacity for aether, the base element for most spells.  

The first two fiery orbs landed wayward while the third descended directly upon me.  A swift thrust of the dagger into the fire quickly began to absorb the blaze.  In the same motion and began to roll forward, the blaze swirling and dissipating around me as I moved toward the sorceress.  

As I recovered out of the roll and steadied myself to my feet, the panicked Marlissa, wide eyed and frantic, began her next spell.  I was prepared for her next move.  I could tell she was weaving another fireball spell to try to get me to back off, but I was already lunging in the air at her with my dagger glowing brightly ablaze.  

The best part of my dual daggers wasn't the fact it could absorb spells.  I began to focus and transfer the aether from one dagger to the other, using my body as a conduit to do so.  It was a trick I learned during the war.  The transfer was visible and the fiery light passed from the dagger, down my arm and across my torso into the other arm.  The other dagger began to radiate a bright light and at the tip of the blade an orb of a fire began to develop.

Just as Marlissa began to unleash her own attack, I had thrust the dagger forth, sending a similar attack back at her.  

At point blank, the orbs exploded right before me but I was prepared for that.  My leather tunic and leggings may seem ordinary to the untrained eye, but Sorensol wasn't only know for its mages.  It was also a land of advanced science and my armor was specially woven with micro-anti aether nanites. Basically, they reflected a degree of magic.  

As I emerged through the smoldering blaze, dread set upon Marlissa's face and all but the imminent defeat began to settle in.  My boots pressed into her chest and knocked her prone to the ground with my right blade resting firmly upon her throat.  Teary eyed and full of anger and fear, she could do nothing but await her fate.

""Please..."" She muttered, as she looked to the hut.  Typically, I would never take my eyes off of the mark.  My stomach turned and my heart felt heavy as what I saw what couldn't possibly be.  A little girl, roughly about the age of 9, stood there scared and uncertain of what was going on. I thought for a moment...

""Knowledgeable Information Database...K.I.D.""  That's what it was.  I've heard rumors... but I never thought it was true.  An amalgam of advanced nanites and aether accumulated into a being.  It was comprised of vast amount of information and designed for typically whatever the client wanted.

My eyes slowly met back with Marlissa's.  I had done a variety of jobs, some I certainly regret doing.  But never had I dealt with anything regarding children.  It was a personal rule of mine. But this was also a situation I didn't quite prepare for.  

""Please..."" Marlissa said again, her bottom lip quivering subtly, ""...they mean to use her for terrible things.  Do what you will with me.  But please don't let them take her.""

It wasn't the woman's plea or the fact that it was a child that was standing in the doorway that gave me pause.  It wasn't that I also had a rule about no children.  Morals, values, and honor had left my soul years ago.

What made me pause and troubled me so, as I grasped the locket that hung from the chain around my neck... my eyes returning to the child.

"ed4fnrk","This is all my own human speculation and opinion, so don't count on it 100%.

I used to ski snow trails regularly. It's a great hill and probably the best place to learn in Ohio. I would expect a hard layer with some loose, swishy, granular stuff on top, but I can't tell you for sure. Man-made snow tends to be hard and slippery when it's groomed, but as it gets skied on the little granules start to appear. As it gets colder later in the day, it might firm up and become less swishy, which is good for making turns. Either way, your beginner won't know the difference and it might be best not even to say anything to her about snow quality yet, so she's not coming in with worries that she doesn't need. Then again, you might want to get her out there next time you get some natural snow.

"ecq0wej","I think it's important to realize that God gave you those feelings. In a way its wonderful that Christians are tested this way. Just follow the light and you will be alright :) 

Many of the religious rules about sexuality don't make sense in the way we make each other obey them. These are things you have to follow inside yourself. You can wear a headscarf for instance (this is also in the Bible actually) but if you put on a lot of makeup to make yourself look sexy, it kind of defeats the purpose. 

A wonderful example I came to experience myself. I have been to gatherings of people who are trying to live in the light (think hippies here) and no one there was wearing the kind of clothes that make a person look more sexually attractive. (much of our fashion actually does this) the clothes were all very colorful and beautiful, but not much tight fitting-figure-accentuating articles. 

Now here is the thing, some people there were actually fully or partially naked. When I arrived this took some adjustment. I was not raised to be comfortable with nudity like that, so there were some feelings related to shame that I had to deal with. But quite quickly I came to the realization that this was not something sexual at all. (many nudists and naturist can attest to this) I found that it was rather much of the opposite. No one was trying to present themselves in a certain way other than who they really were. All physical attributes were eather purely the way in which God created them, or in the case of clothing/make up, it was either practical or some kind of artistic expression of themselves. This was a truly wonderful and refreshing experience.

Now when I got back into the real world (or Babylon as those 'hippies' liked to call it) I found that was when I really had to adjust myself back, and that was when some insight into the old testament really hit me. As soon as I arrived in some public spaces I found myself (I am a guy attracted to women) continously distracted by the clothes that young women around me were wearing. All the time, from the corner of my eyes, my reptile-brain was lured to look at these bodies with their articles of clothing, which I now realize were designed and put on exactly for that reason. I found myself becoming a bit agitated because I didn't want to be in this head space really. I had such a wonderful time before; it was all so pure and not revolving around these base desires in the way that I was now struggling to avoid on public transportation. 

I laughed a bit inside myself, because my mind went to all these kinds of rules that religious people try to put on each other. I just figured out the essence of it, and this essence is something you have to understand and follow inside yourself, as opposed to try and make rules about it for each other. And judge each other about this. 

Much of the gospels are actually about this; many times we see Jesus 'colliding' with priests who try to pin him on some kind of rule or another. Jesus is very clear about this: THESE RULES ARE THERE FOR US, WE ARE NOT THERE FOR THE RULES. 

He broke the rule of the sabbath, in order to heal some one. He showed with that what I have been trying to tell you here also; We can never make a system of rules and regulations that capture the Devine light perfectly. Behaving blindly and exactly according to rules and protocols is not what God intends for us. The Devine light is within ourselves and all around us.

"eblc5kf","I like them. They are different from the high-sci-fi we saw in X3 and much more unconventional.

For example, a lot of ships have thrusters in a hammerhead style configuration, which is alien to standard sci-fi, but makes perfect sense in space. 

Many of the fighters and M ships look good. Nothing amazingly beautiful, but still good. Quite a few such as the Pulsar variant from Antigone space look pretty awesome.

I've never been a fan of Paranid ships, even from X3. However, I like the new Teladi over the old, and Argon haven't really changed. 

Overall, it's a new universe. Antimatter power sources have modified how ships can be constructed, as thrusters are clearly much smaller and engines don't take up so much of the ship that they must be placed at the aft. Similarly, weapons are much more compact, and able to be mounted in many places without large in-ship housings. Having elements such as shield generators modular and exposed also reduces the need for interior space.

"e8lhsfx","It looks to me like your partner enjoys games that have a lot of meaningful choices, but don't require a lot of reflexes to master. I'll pore through my vault and see if I can find anything...

**Civilization, any title** (I prefer VI). The Civilization games are *great* at having things work under the hood that your partner shouldn't need to think about unless they really want to delve deep into them. Until then: holy shit, I'm Tomyris! She's the absolute best! This works really well if they have a mind for history, like, *really* well. Every round is laden with choices on how to position, how to build, how to proceed, and beyond that there is the enduring wonder of being an actor in human history. It's undeniably absorbing.

**Cube Escape/the Rusty Lake series**. This is a series of games that spawned from the ""escape the room"" genre, but matured into this really odd, dreamlike adventure series inspired very heavily by the absurdist works of David Lynch. Most interestingly, the Cube Escape series is free, and your partner can play them right now with no investment. In this vein, I can also suggest **The Room**, which is available on mobile and PC, is similarly birthed in escape-room games and has also evolved into something strange and beautiful, but more Cthulhoid and inhuman than dreamlike and unreal.

**Starbound**. This thing eats time. You explore other worlds, suctioning away their precious resources (and decorations) to exalt yourself (and build cool floating castles) in the Minecraft apocalypse that happens when they give you a spaceship. It's a bit twitchier than other games, but not dangerously so, and the customization and building options are absolutely engrossing. There's some survival mechanics, but not so much that you don't feel on top of things a lot of the time.

**Fallen London/Sunless Sea**. Fallen London is a free-to-play, explorative storytelling game that can be played in any browser and requires no more skill than the ability to read; Sunless Sea is the evolution thereof, an exploration-focused variant of the theme, set in the same unusual world, that demands more in resource management but shockingly similar amounts of twitch ability. By tradition, one falls into one, and then the other, forever and ever.

As I must recommend a JRPG or be derelict in my duty, **Persona 5**. This is an absolutely gorgeous, engrossing, careful, considered game about revolution, rejection of societal norms, navigation of the cultural subconscious and making friends with every single person in Tokyo that is easy to get into for even a newbie to the genre, difficult to master, but a pleasure to complete. It has an engaging and available story, but will require a bit of decisionmaking to get to - and if she's into it, Persona 4 is one of my favorite games of all time, and Persona 3 was the one that got me into it. There's a lot of good here.",1540724168,"in this vein, i can also suggest **the room**, which is available on mobile and pc, is similarly birthed in escape-room games and has also evolved into something strange and beautiful, but more cthulhoid and inhuman than dreamlike and unreal.","strange and beautiful","beautiful",NA,FALSE,"strange and beautiful","strange",NA,NA,0
"e8lgf06","**Croatia**: Stunning beauty, mixing the alpine region in the North West, which feels like Austria, with the Mediterranean region in the South which feels a lot like Italy. Decent prices. Good roads with reasonably well behaved drivers. People can be a bit miserable, and in the South they can be a bit loud. In the more rural areas you'll need your own transport as public transit is rare/non-existent. In cities, especially Zagreb, public transit is great.

**Romania**: North of the Carpathian Mountains, the countryside is beautiful with rolling hills and quaint almost idyllic villages. To the South, it's a bit uglier and has more of an ex-Soviet vibe. The people seem unhappy and have a tendency to scam foreigners. It's one of the cheapest countries in Europe. Corruption, especially high-up, is apparently rife. Public transit is pretty bad, but okay if you're not in a hurry and have tolerance for delays, dirt and beggars. Internet is great!

**India**: I'd avoid. Too many problems. Very poor country with a people who seem too exhausted or content to do much about it. The economy is growing but most of the country seems to be in decline. Get out of the cities along the Western Ghats and the nature is beautiful, but the infrastructure is awful. There are a few scammers but mostly the people are just unreliable - you cannot take anyone on their word. Big cities have a few blocks up to Western standards, but you'll pay a premium to be there and you might as well be in the West. 

**Malaysia**: Kuala Lumpur is up there with the other global cities. Excellent public transport, loads of choices for food, clothing and entertainment. English-speaking locals. Well-maintained infrastructure. Great air connections via KLIA to the rest of the world, and high-speed rail from the airport to the city. Good food. The people are mostly polite but I found them a bit bland. Political corruption was a problem but their new government shows signs of  change. Outside of KL, standards are much lower. Penang hasn't kept pace with development and feels almost like a run-down British seaside resort. Rubbish bus services, gridlocked traffic, more of an inward-looking culture. It's very easy for a Brit to visit KL as you can stay there for 3 months with a visa exemption, and the plugs are the same as back home!

**Vietnam**: I seem to be in the minority here, but I absolutely hated it. I struggle to find anything positive to say. Very few mosquitoes? You can buy wine for cheap. Baguettes. Other than that, an utterly scummy culture reminiscent of China. Rude, loud, greedy, selfish. There's nothing communist about it except for the absence of democracy. The cities are dirty, rat-infested stinkholes. The countryside is beautiful and mountainous. The train ride from HCMC to Hanoi, which takes a couple of days, is quite fun. The cities are connected North-South by rail. The people have no concept of driving safely. You think Thailand is bad? You ain't seen nothing. Apparently the economy is growing and some people say the people are wonderful. They seem deluded to me.

The goal should be to focus on letting go of the parts of you that are holding you back in order to better benefit yourself first the people around you IMO which ego death can definitely help, but only in the post trip reconstruction phase.

Plus the ego is an essential tool for survival and human communication so theres that. The way out of the prison is to integrate the shadow and make moves outside your own mind. Treat the world as the psychedelic experience. Follow your gut, not your head. Knowledge is power but power corrupts and curiosity killed the cat. Find equilibrium though, delusions are still rampant. The societally correct response is not always correct. Overrationalizing leads to overthinking which leads to fear which leads to death.

"e5lvurc","I'm actually referring to the country itself as in the feminist culture, laws and media. The culture in general is just beta, soy and quite socialist/statist. 

Let's contrast it with the US that started with a bloody but heroic revolution against the British. US was originally very libertarian and people didn't look to solve their problems with government rather by individuals or from the blood of patriots.

Australia however instead sort of had a failed revolution (or rather uprising) at the Eureka Stockade, where the government obliterated the rebels. There's even a failed rebel folk hero named Ned Kelly (dude literally made working bullet proof plate armor in a bush forge) who got fucked up by the police cause his armor didn't cover his arms. 

Any long story, but this framed the relationship between Australians and their government as one of submission. Many are even genetic descendants of convicts from the original settlement of the country. The country is big and beautiful but it have no strong anti-government history to inoculate it from statist lunacy like the US does.  

You are not even allowed to legally defend yourself from physical attack in Australia. You can't carry weapons with intent to use for self-defence and if you do defend it needs to be equal force. So if the attacker has a bat you can't pull out a firearm or even a knife. It's lacks basic human dignity rights like you'd have in the US or even parts of Europe and Asia.

"e5lsf72","My brain: Nooo.. Stop telling people about my favorite spot.  Seriously though. You can bike, hike and even paddle into it. It is one of my favorite spots. I have camped and hiked and biked and kaayaked all over this area. Road, MTB ad gravel biking. Everything is fantastic. Hiking trails extend into the nearby waterloo area. I like some of the nearby car campgrounds as well but so far as i know there are no other non-car camping spots in the area. I do also have many favorite stealth camping spots in the area, but for obvious reasons i cannot talk about those. My favorite time of the year to go up there is any time i can, but particularly in the off season when it is quiet. Fall is a favorite, but  when its dead winter and the lakes are all frozen over and you can xcski and fatbike them.

Sadly I know of no other place in SE michigan to trailside camp away from cars until you get up to manistee national forest. There are plenty of cool places to camp, little primative campgrounds, but they are all car campable which often dimishes the natural feel of them.

Btw, Oak Openings in toledo does have a cool campground and is beautiful, but it is still a car campground. I have hiked the entire trail. It does also have some fantastic and new mtb trail as well. They don't overlap that much, but the hiking trail is flat. Beautiful, but flat.

The next nearest place is the fantasitic Mohican Wilderness area and Mohican State forest. It has about a dozen trailside camp areas which are free, self registration and many of them are fantastic. I absolutely have my favorites but I am not saying which ones. ;)  Like the other places Mohican has incredible hiking, biking, paddling and other recreation opportunities. It's probably the best place for hundreds of miles.

Heres a tip we use to located non-car camp areas. We follow the routes of the buckeye trail and North Country trail. The NCT does go all the way through michigan. I have followed 90% of it by bike or foot through the lower penisula. It has a knack for leading you to some pretty fantastic places to camp. Many beautiful and quiet, though most car accessible until youget into the manistee forest area.  Much of it is legally bikeable backroad and lots of singletrack, but I am very respectful to use road workarounds on the non-bike areas lest bikers loose access. In fact we did a fantastic 5 day mtb ride from Grand Rapids to the Traverse city for the ice man race last year following most of the NCT. We are repeating it this Oct/Nov, but sticking to dirt roads and a little pavement.  So.. there are plenty of cool camp areas along the mtb in extreme souhern Mich along the NCT, but again.. they are all car accessible campgrounds.

In ohio there are some very interesting developments at some of the parks the NCT and Buckeye Trails pass through East of cleveland. Some of these parks have adirondack shelters at hike in only campsites. Specifically Adirondacks with fire places. It seems to be a new focus of the park districts in particular north of Chardin. I think it corresponds with Chardin ohio's record average snowfall and hence winter focus on snowshoe and xc ski. It is Ohios snowbelt and gets more snow on average then Buffalo New York. Needless to say i absolutley love adirondacks shelters, especially those with wood fireplaces. 

Adirondacks are non existent in Michigan in my travels.. a new occurance in ohio, no other place in my extensive ohio travels following the buckeye / NCT have i found them. Most obviously Adirondacks dot the AT, there are a few on the 330 mile GAP (Great Allegheny Passage) from Pittsburg to DC. The Laurel Highlamds Trail is absolutely spoiled with them in PA (HIGHLY recommended) but it does seem PA in general is absolutely loaded with Adirondacks. In fact in four weeks or so we are going to Oil Creek State Park just across the state line. It has two adirondack trailside camp area with perhaps 10-12 adirondack shelters. Adirondacks clearly seem to concentrate around winter sport, ie. xcski and snowshoe areas. I presume this is one of the draws of Oil Creek. Will see.

P.S. on a side note. Giving all this info makes me realize just how spoiled I, my SO and my friends are to have biked, hiked, snowshoed, xc ski'd, kayaked and canoed so much of the midwest. I have favorite roads, trails, campsites and rivers all over Michigan, Ohio and have barely scratched the surface of PA. Yet I have hiked /biked 80% of the 1000 of miles buckeye trail / NCT in ohio and 90% of it in the lower peninsula of Michigan. Many areas of it I have been on so many times i cannot count, indeed I live and work along it in Northern Ohio. Some favorite spots not mentioned above are Tar Hollow, Ohio best kept secrete for trails and back country camping and hiking in the Hocking Hills. Manistee National forest for... everything.. and yet i have not paddled the Manistee yet!?   Chardin Ohio is the best bet for winter activities due being ohios snow belt. The Au Sable river Michigan for best paddling. The Tuscawaras River roads for best bike touring. The GAP for best bike tour route, have done it to many times to count. 

Oh! If you are still with me! A little reward. Granger Island, Toledo Metroparks! Just opened to primative paddle (or hike in if the Maumee River is low) campsites and a furnished cabin. Promises to be spectacular. Just opened this summer. Have not even stayed there yet. Its very close from SE michigan and probably the ONLY place besides blind lake that isn't a car camp spot.

One last one. This probably does not interest you but there are 6-12 campsites of various qualities on North Maumee Bay. These are paddle or boat in only, first come, first serve. Some are a little overgrown, others a bit brushed out and a few to much trash though someone loves and maintains them. Nice, but I would say power boats are the cars of the lakes and just like car camping they bring people whom don't necesarily appreciate and respect nature. :(",1536400938,"beautiful, but flat.","beautiful, but flat","beautiful","but",TRUE,"beautiful , but flat","flat",NA,NA,1

"e5a767x","If I am so bad why are you still here if I am the most uneducated person on Reddit? This is a quite a hysterical display. I am sure there are plenty of people who don't even know who Kant is. Anyway here are the responses you were asking for.

&gt;There  is no objective standard for beauty, especially in art. What one group  of people find artistically pleasing can be very different from what  another group of people find satisfying. This can vary broadly based on  place, time, and culture, as well as simple personal opinion.

As I said I don't like the distinction between objective and subjective in examining highly complex phenomena. Interaction between the subject and the object is likely so complicated here that is beyond human imagination. The taste is of course highly relative and differences are probably caused your preferences and ignorance. It is possible to learn to appreciate something, which I believe is the real component of art. In any case there is a lot room for arbitrary styles that are socially created, meaning they are random products of culture. Beauty is real I believe. There is no process that can make menacing scary landscape into beautiful and inviting. 

&gt;If  you wanted to make something with mass appeal, there's no easy way to  do so (or perhaps I should say no algorithmic way). An artist may have  an general idea of what is popular in a certain community, but this  local knowledge isn't generalizable. Additionally, there is no single  ""public opinion."" Many people hold many different opinions on different  kinds of art and these opinions might not be very deeply held, stable,  or consistent. This results partially from the mass public not being  particularly educated about art or architecture. All of this poses  problems for a government commission trying to prevent ugly buildings,  because there is little authoritative basis beyond their own opinion  that they can use to judge by. I'll circle back to this no being  algorithmic: we would like bureaucracies to be able to follow a  straightforward and unbiased procedure to reach a conclusion, but this  isn't possible in this case.

I would like great many things that doesn't mean I am going to get it. We don't have an algorithmic model of human mind. The solution is to use distributed social system that will assign values to things based on reputation and honour. I don't like bureaucrats anyway I just need you to play along. You need to voice your opinion on art, even if there is nothing objective about it, even if there is a risk you might go against the crowd and be ridiculed. 

&gt;A  badly run commission of the type above, aside from simply being  capricious, may end up halting the process of experimentation and  rebellion that is central to the progression of all types of art. This  would be a huge loss for the art in question. It also becomes self  contradictory, because many art styles we now consider ""historical"" and  beautiful were once thought to be avante guarde and radical.

This is not applicable.

&gt;The  focus on cities as ugly is unproductive. Suburbia is far more ugly and  more expensive, worse for the environment, and worse for the psyche. On  this basis, we should seek to urbanize suburbia so that the benefits of  urbanity can expand. Instead, the preoccupation with beauty leads the  author of the video at least to push for policies that would exclude   many people from urban living and instead envisions the city as a  museum, where beauty becomes the primary purpose of the city at the  expense of livability.

I am not focusing on cities. I am focusing on people.

I think there is a serious problem that you believe systems is all there is.

This is highlighted in your erroneous belief that Kant's universal morals are objective. Not only that it is false, it can be demonstrated to be false in just a couple of sentences. Kant's morals might appear objective given his metaphysical system is true, but there is no argument to be made why should anyone accept his metaphysical system over any other. It is ultimately predicated on subjective choice. This is why I don't pay too much attentions to details in Kant. He failed to patch the holes in philosophy left by Hume. They are still there.

Whatever system you have it is merely a product of human mind and as such it is imperfect. All you can only compare it the reality using your judgement. What is judgement and how does it work? That's also subject to this principle. That's all we have. Only think that we can say about the nature of reality with certainty is that it is fundamentally mysterious. You must never confuse your model of reality with the real thing, because that singular mistake leads straight to dogmatism and authoritarianism. Anomalies can't exist and you mustn't break the rules.

This is the problem when you want architects to use their systems to authoritatively decide what is beautiful. If your system says something is beautiful but great number of people find it difficult to look at then the system is wrong and needs to be revised regardless of its internals.",1535918968,"there is no process that can make menacing scary landscape into beautiful and inviting.   &gt;if  you wanted to make something with mass appeal, there's no easy way to  do so (or perhaps i should say no algorithmic way).","beautiful and inviting","beautiful",NA,FALSE,"beautiful and inviting","inviting",NA,NA,1

Another way it's horrific for the child is that the kid probably isn't gay, and if you're a straight kid and your parents faggots that's a little weird, wouldn't you say? How would that make you feel? I think dykes are objectively worse than gay dudes, fuck dykes raising kids, it's bad enough most kids today are raised by their moms anyways. But even if you have two dads, it's still weird and, what are they both going to be imasculated? Is only one going to be imasculated? An imasculated man is no role-model and shouldn't be anywhere around kids.

And honestly, what are the chances that these guys are some looney liberals who are just another two mental weirdos.

The real question is why on earth should gays be allowed to be around children in the first place. The burden of proof should be on you to show me that. And even if you come up with the best possible scenario, both the kids dads are normal, relatively passable not gay dudes who do some wholesome activities with their kids, it's still always going to be worse than the same best case scenario for a mother and a father, the natural order.

Are you sure everything about Western ""civilization"" is as wholesome as you think? Or maybe there are issues with ""civilization"" that need to be dealt with. Maybe not to the extent that Varg wants, but I don't really mind hearing an extremist's point of view in that regard.

____________

You know what, I just remembered this: Maybe this ""empathy"" bullshit has a lot to do with everything. One of the biggest lies of the modern world is that we are all the same, but specifically in mental function. What this means is that naive white liberals think that all of the world has the same mental ""experience"" as they do. Imagine what it's like having an iq of even 90. Imagine what it's like having an iq of 70. You can't, and neither can they. So it's no surprise that suddenly we have all of these traitors.

_________________

I mean confidence is a big part of attraction too. Have to train that as well. I think it's two-fold. People shouldn't complain if they're unaccomplished and unattractive, that's just nature.

But most women today are trained to be traitorous whores who's value in life is dependent on being a wage slave and sucking as much dick as possible. That's valid.

I honestly don't know how anyone could get a virgin outside of high school, other than maybe getting them right before they go to college but good luck.

&gt; u/KekGratiaRex: ""Starting a small town on a privately owned land would be amazing. Just hope I don't get Ruby Ridged/Waco'd.""

Waco IMO is a blackpill. Just have to keep things above board and legal. Prepare for the worst, hope for the best. If Waco guys had a federal dealer license they wouldn't have been murdered.

Problem is it'll cost something like $1 mil, so that's about 10 years of salary work.

Seriously. I'd rather look to something like rooted paganism mixed with some wholesome teachings from Christianity in a non literal way and live life like there's something larger than the self, than have to spend it trying to prove the existence of a literal ghost in the sky to some fedora fagget.

__________________

Literally, I don't think there is actually a ghost in the sky.

&gt; u/viscous_continuity: ""i think it's a little trivial to classify god as some sort of ""ghost in the sky"". ever consider the theory of macro organisms and/or an extra-dimensional omnipotent force based upon collective morality? heh, didn't think so kid""

Macro organisms? As in group behavior, of course. Omnipotent force? I believe in god in a non-literal sense. It's a force of nature. So I actually agree with you in that it's much more complicated and beautiful, but I think it's not the brightest to set yourself up for a debate about ""god being real"" when I don't think you can prove that.

&gt; u/viscous_continuity: ""I was referring to beyond group behavior. Theoretical of course. So I guess we do agree though on the second half of your statement. Granted you can't technically disprove God either. Just Judaic texts. But that gets into a whole nother mess of semantics, language, and interpretation. None of which I'm a professional on and is considered highly subjective.""

To be fair, I don't think this stuff should be complicated at all. The average folk should be able to understand this stuff, so I just prefer to admit that ""god isn't real"" but god isn't dead, if that makes sense.

&gt; u/viscous_continuity: ""That's why I am more or less a Christian apologist. Humiliation, forgiveness, and sacrifice, etc. all wrapped up in a little package easy for everyone to understand and look up to. Don't get me wrong though, I don't like any denomination of the church. As a common issue is that they don't press on the complexity of these virtues. But I get ya.""

I like paganism better, less forgiveness. But I think there are great lessons from parts of Christianity. We'll just have to agree to disagree.",1530159181,"so i actually agree with you in that it's much more complicated and beautiful, but i think it's not the brightest to set yourself up for a debate about ""god being real"" when i don't think you can prove that.  &gt; u/viscous_continuity: ""i was referring to beyond group behavior.","complicated and beautiful","beautiful",NA,FALSE,"more complicated and beautiful","complicated",NA,"more",0

A socialist culture will create primary psychopaths that do what others can't, but unlike a Capitalist culture it will be for the benefit of all. Firefighters, construction, emergency rescue, EMS, high voltage electricians, extended and isolated guard duty, high risk transport like ice road trucking, these are all professions that psychopaths can succeed if they are given care and an environment that reinforces Socialist theory.

"dxhazo0","Polaris is definitely a bad choice. 

What me you can hire AI crew you‚Äôre not going to be very effective. Hiring all AI for a starfarer or Orion is ok. They‚Äôre not combat oriented. So you don‚Äôt really need players to have fun with those. Just get some AI crew and you‚Äôre set. 


If you‚Äôre doing combat AI won‚Äôt cut it for the operation of a ship especially not a full size capital destroyer like the Polaris. 


During the Q&amp;A it was stated the Polaris is not a ship you can just fly around. 

It has one mission and that mission is to slip into an area, fire it‚Äôs deadly volley or torpedos and leave. The Polaris isn‚Äôt designed to stay in a fight. On top of that it‚Äôs been said that the Polaris will be very expensive to operate. If you‚Äôre taking it somewhere there‚Äôs a high cost to pay so anytime you move it better be because you‚Äôre moving to the next mission area. Those not a ton of room for error  or flexibility with the Polaris. 


Now the hammerhead is feasible with Just you and a friend. It‚Äôs main job is to show up with all guns blazing. It‚Äôs a ship that has a real presence when it shows up. It‚Äôs got very very big turrets. You can hire 6 AI to man those and while they probably won‚Äôt be as good as a player they‚Äôll hit sometimes and the guns are big enough that as long as you‚Äôre fighting other AI and average players you can do relatively well. You pilot and your friend can take the turret with the largest fov, then you just have some AI for making repairs. That being said it‚Äôs still probably not a super good idea.  It‚Äôs feasible for sure but only so long as you‚Äôre ok with losing a lot of fights. 

If it‚Äôs just you and a buddy I‚Äôd recommend a few different ships. 


First is the constellation andromeda. Not huge and beautiful. But it‚Äôs got a lot packed into that thing. It‚Äôs got about 46 missiles. Half being size 1 and half size 2. Not big missiles but you pack a lot. 4 size 5 guns. And two dual size 2 turrets. Plus a cargo bay to fit extra ammo,missiles,fuel,and replacement parts. It also packs a small snub fighter so you or your friend can run to the back and use that for light fighter support. Armor and weapons lockers inside Incase you get boarded. And 4 beds for you, your friends, and/or AI. The beds double as escape pods. There‚Äôs also a kitchen and bathroom for longer voyages to mission sites. 


The second is the retaliator bomber. very similar but less jack of all trades mercenary ship and more along the lines of a specific job military/militia ship. It has no main guns, instead it carries a payload of large torpedoes (same ones the Polaris has just less of them) and 5 dual size 2 turrets to defend yourself from fighters. It‚Äôs got a private captains room. Bathroom, and crew quarters. Can‚Äôt remember if it has escape pods or ejection bunks. This ones definitely less of a versatile combat ship and more of a laser focused damage dealer and antifighter support craft. 


The third ship is recommend is if size is a bigger concern but you still want a ship realistically operable by  2 players with some AI. That ship would be the 600i explorer version. Don‚Äôt let the name fool you. It may be geared to exploration but it‚Äôll make a decent combat craft as well. Carries  14 size 4 missiles I believe. Has 3 size 5 guns (one less than Connie) and two dual size 2 turrets. So essentially the same firepower as a Connie, just one less main cannon and less missiles but they‚Äôre bigger and will be more effective per hit. Plus room for cargo for that ammo, fuel, replacement parts but also has a secondary bay for a ground vehicle should you wish to do ground missions or you can just fill that with more cargo. Large powerplant and advanced scanning systems. Large private captains quarters and pretty nice communal crew quarters. Has escape pods. Has a large holo radar station which would certainly help in tracking hostile ships and navigating combat areas. Massive field of view from the bridge. Has armor racks, not sure on gun racks tho. Has a pool table and lounge area. Lots of windows. Not a pure combat ship but if you want a large ship capable of decent combat while being operable by only two players. I‚Äôd go with that if size is a big concern. ",1523920850,"not huge and beautiful.","huge and beautiful","beautiful",NA,FALSE,"huge and beautiful","huge",NA,NA,0

‚ÄúYou do not belong here,‚Äù the Princess‚Äôs dark, low voice rang through the empty chamber in a small echo. Her eyes watched him as he took his seat against the wall, knees spread, eyes regarding her with silent intent. ‚ÄúEven my mother would agree to that.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo I have one question for you, Leyton Hightower,‚Äù she said, ‚Äúor perhaps two, depending on what you answer. Do you wish to die?‚Äù

Now, I do sometimes fantasize over having the most romantic first time ever. Like, I do sometimes daydream over it, and I daydream over having my first time in a fond manner, with it being highly lovely and romantic. 

So, yes, I do sometimes daydream about it. However...

I most want to have someone to love and one who loves me. Someone I can kiss, someone I can hug, and someone who will just hug and hold me. I don't think I've ever had that in a relationship, an ""I love you"". So, yeah, that's what I want most.

The same goes for a butt. Aren't butts supposed to be hot, with a butt obsession?  How many songs are about butts these days? Yeah, people worship butts. I don't know what one feels like. Is there something to the booty, really? I have no idea. 

See? I kind of have never really experienced anything like that before. So, I sometimes get interested in finding that part out. It's like another world out there.

So, yeah, I do wonder what it's like for real. I do sometimes feel curious to have sex for sure in that sense. However, I must also admit, I do feel peer pressure to do it. Part of me does feel really *""behind""* everyone else, since what 98% of people my age have already had sex.

But if it's not, I would have to equate this to walking into the cheesecake factory for the first time and asking the waiter/ress what they recommend or what's good here. 

My generic answer to this is what is your end game? What are you hoping to achieve? 

If your answer is to make a big number quick, I'd dial that back. A lot. 

Stocks are so turbulent that any sudden down or upswing can have detrimental effects to anything you own. For example, when the whole Dr. Dao incident with United Airlines happened, quite literally overnight the United/Continental Holdings group had a valuation loss of almost a billion dollars. Of course, the stock righted itself within a day or two, but those who had a stoploss built in, lost a good chunk of change because of that. 

Media postings, product recalls/launches, changes of leadership (both internally and board of directors), hell even the cost of fuel is only scratching at 1/10 of 1% of things you are looking for in a company. 

When it comes to money to invest, don't take money you can't afford to lose and put it on something that *might* have a possibility of doing some good. Save money so you can eventually put it into something that will work for you long run. 

Think of it as an investment in yourself. Expect to lose way more than you can gain. But from day one, don't expect to see a return. If it happens great, but, just like Vegas, don't expect to walk away a winner. 

I could give you some ideas, but I've gotten lucky on some of my investments. Airlines for example. 10 years ago I invested about 100 shares in DAL when it was roughly $8.50/share and right after the bankruptcy and the merger completed its final piece of the puzzle. It's currently sitting at or around $54/share. I was told, over and over again, never to invest in the airlines as the volatility of the transportation industry is too high to outweigh the risk of reward. 

Hindsight is a beautiful but useless thing. I had never heard of Amazon until the last few years. And now I'm (along with almost everyone) kicking myself because I didn't do any research. 

It has taken years of due diligence, market watching, and trend setting to figure out what needs to be done. Cryptocurrency is my current research mode. I always look for random IPOs to delve my free time in, just to see if anything is worthwhile for a long term investment.

"dujdzd9","What? This is the stupidest comment I have ever read on this sub.

Try using parallel fifths on a two voice counterpoint texture and see what happens. It sounds hollow precisely because one voice loses independence. Just like a unison. I believe it was Zarlino who used those adjectives to refer to consecutive perfect intervals, or something along those lines in his Art of Counterpoint (or maybe it was Le Institutione Harmoniche) btw, I'm not pulling it out of my ass. And I trust Zarlino about 16th century perception of music and the peak of counterpoint texture much more than a random redditor.

What later composers think about it matters not, since we are discussing the perception of strict counterpoint, with Zarlino as our main theorist behind it. Parallel fifths and octaves go against our very notion of counterpoint because voice independence was key (although creating a counterpoint style in which parallel consonances are desirable is possible, and Ars Nova composers did it from time to time actually), *because* a proper counterpoint texture should feel full, warm, nice (all terms used by 16th and early 17th century theorists), it was believed that parallel fifths and eights had the opposite effect on music, and I agree. Unlike them I don't think they're not beautiful, but perfect consonances are quite sterile. They don't have much life or color to them, and they sound rash and aggressive, which is great, actually. I mean, Pictures at an exhibition is full of them and it's a beautiful composition all around.

"du9b5j0","The Bible clearly teaches that God created the material universe. That's no debatable in biblical theology.

But Genesis 1 is not about material manufacture, but assigning roles and functions. So of course God cannot assign a function without first commanding its materialization.

The Bible tells us that God is the creator. It doesn't specify what processes he used or how long it took. Evolutionary processes can easily fit into the biblical picture.

What Genesis 1 is about is God assigning roles and functions.

   - DAY 1: The light and the dark function to give us day and night, evening and morning, and therefore the function of TIME.
   - DAY 2: The expanse (""firmament"") was viewed in the ancient world as the mechanism that regulated moisture and sunlight. The ancients perceived the sky as a solid dome, but it's not their perception of the physical composition that was their concern, but rather its function. On Day 2 God is being recognized as giving the expanse the function of REGULATING CLIMATE‚Äîthe weather systems that make life possible. From Akkadian and Mesopotamian literature, we know that they perceived a close relationship between the ""firmament"" and the weather.
   - DAY 3: We can see clearly that the function of the earth was to produce vegetation: AGRICULTURE and the amazing provision of food. So the first three days we have time, weather, and agriculture.
   - DAY 4: Day 4 is clear. The ""lights in the expanse"" are to function ""to serve as signs to make seasons and days and years...to govern the day...and night""‚Äîthe progression of SEASONS‚Äîvery important to the ancients. By contrast with the ancient mythologies, the sun, moon and stars were not gods but functionaries under the sovereignty of YHWH.
   - DAY 5: God installed functionaries in the way we fill our house with pots, pans, furniture, and tools, to carry out the functions of that room. They not only make it beautiful but also functional. Again, in contrast to the ancient mythologies, there creatures are not antagonists to be defeated but creatures that have a role to play.
   - DAY 6: The animals are understood in their various domains to function within that domain with their separate roles: some are livestock, some wild‚Äîbut all with a functional relationship to each other, to the earth, and to us. Then we are told of the proper role and function of humans: to rule and subdue as God's co-regents on earth, as priests and priestesses (equality in status, role, and function) in His ""temple"".
   - DAY 7: God came to dwell (""rest"") in his temple, to be their God and for them to be His people, and to engage His creation as Lord.

"dtoqlxe","I try to avoid the Soulsborne comparisons because the games are different from each other in nearly every way. That said, without *any* other frame of reference, the combat in both Soulsborne and MHW are heavily focused on position, timing, and knowledge; knowledge of both your weapon, and of your opponent.

Your adversaries in MHW are dangerous, and later on there will be very little room for error. 14 weapons, each with branching upgrades to roll out, makes for plenty of variety, and even without traditional RPG stats, a large number of 'skills' that you can apply to mid-late game armor provide build variety as well. It's worth noting that each weapon plays *very* differently and will change the way you engage enemies from the ground up. 

The story is simple, and (so far) doesn't try to be more than it is. You're a monster hunter, part of colony of sorts, and you hunt monsters. There's no shadowy cult, or big betrayal, and you never have to fight something that isn't a monster for sake of 'story'. If your looking for the same kind of hands-off depth you find in Soulsborne, look elsewhere. I get the feeling the story is very second-string in this game, but I *immensely* appreciate that they didn't try to force some big dramatic storyline in when it wasn't needed. Killing giant monsters it's fun and it's okay for that to *be* the game. 

Visually, the game is beautiful, but vibrant as opposed to Soulsborne typically grimdark pallet. Armor and weapon designs are all over the place and subjective, but your bound to find something that appeals to you. My favorite thing about the Soulsborne games is that when you kill something, you get to wear their shit and use their weapons and in that too, I guess, MHW is the same.

Edit: Forgot to mention, I hope you like menus bruh, because there are a LOT of systems on the back end of this game, from crafting, resupplying, augmenting, item and inventory management, social interaction, and even side missions for your Palico.

Two weeks later, the other lug broke before Christmas and I sent it in again, pretty crushed.

He was disappeared from my life overnight. His cell number was changed, his parents refused to open the door when I knocked, he didn't respond to my emails, no MSN responses....nothing. 

I was devastated and destroyed, but I was also 18, so even though the world was definitely abruptly ending and I had no way of recovering from that, I knew that I would get over it. 

Eventually Aly because a beautiful but sad memory, but before wasting two years of my life chasing after every boy that even remotely reminded me of him. The feelings subsided and eventually I met my husband. 

About four years ago I ran into his brother. His brother could barely hold eye contact with me, because he knew exactly who I was and what his parents had done. I walked up to him and asked him if he knew who I was. He acknowledged me. 

I couldn't help myself, I just had to ask what happened to the first boy I ever loved. ""He's married, with three children in Saudi Arabia"" 

All of the feelings of hurt that I ever felt came flooding back, and I was a wreck for a good couple of months after that brief 3 minute meetings. To know that a man who had so deeply loved me and cared for me, and to be crass, had fucked me so good, could spend the rest of his life locked away in the Desert Kingdom was so devastating. 

Run my friend, run and never look back. His life is his to live. And unfortunately, I doubt it would be happy.

We also encourage owners to love with actions rather than food, and send them home with low calorie treats.

"dqhn006","Heck that's only really the Northern Half of the Coast.

Further down can be very beautiful but its increasingly remote. Newport and Florence are really the last 'tourist' focused towns for a while. Florence is also note worthy as it's the northern end of the Dunes. Between Florence and Reedsport are the Oregon Dunes National Recreation Area. They are incredible.

Reedsport is the mouth of the Umpqua. When you're traveling south from Astoria, it's the first river since the Columbia that actually crosses the Coast Range. It's a deep and beautiful valley. 

South of Reedsport only one more Highway in Oregon crosses the mountains, and that's route 42, which is a twisty mountain road always under construction and was closed for months last year due to landslides. You may see maps showing more roads. Do not believe them. They are logging roads not designed for use in winter, and every year tourists die like [James Kim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Kim). The Coast mountain range is small compared to the Cascades or Rockies. But the Southern Coast range (or Callahans) is mostly ~3000 feet basalt peaks, which are tall enough to keep snow a good part of the year. Roads like Bear Camp Road look like they go through, but they are logging roads that don't get plowed and will accumulate snow.

But this remote southern section has some interesting and great places. Coos Bay and North Bend make up the largest city on the entire coast. But the economics have not been kind in recent years. Its a bit far from Urban Areas for lots of reliable tourism. Fishing, Timber and the Port were big industries. They want to do tourism but I feel like they only have the Casino acting as an attraction. 

Further south you have smaller towns, including my favorite: Bandon. Bandon has rock formations to beat anything further up the coast. It's also got a charming district and a great Botanical garden. They used to have a great dairy as well, until Tillamook bought them out and shut it down. (BTW bandon cheese is now Tillamook but like a dollar less). 

There's several beautiful light houses in this area, including the Umpqua , Coquille , Charleston , and Port Orford lighthouses.

A more comedic story (though only half complete) is called ""The Intelligent Fly,"" which is about a fly who can talk and goes around having conversations with people. There's an underlying question as to why he's considered intelligent because he's wrong about a lot of things, but the story concludes: ""It's not what he knew that singled him out.

"dpg37lb","Hi, Punk Rocker here just thought I'd chime in with my take on two of my favorite genres aside from Punk Rock of course :).

Obviously both of these bay-side genres are different, but their similarities are striking. (I jokingly call K-Pop ‚ÄúThe Hip Hop of the East‚Äù.) Both genres embody contrasts and contradictions. I always preach that Hip Hop is much more cosmopolitan than people give it credit for and K-Pop is much less sophisticated than people want to believe‚Äîin a way, both genres are the opposite of their stereotypes.

Population: Both genres are around 800,000-ish (I include Rap with Hip Hop) and their combined statistical areas are each about 8-million-ish.

Diversity: Both genres are about 50% non-white. Hip Hop skews black (25‚Äì30%), K-Pop skews Asian (30%). Hip Hop is much more diverse than people realize and K-Pop is much less diverse than people like to think. And both genres are racist and segregated‚Äîyes K-Pop, your racial sh*t stinks just as much as, if not worse than, Hip Hop‚Äôs.

Politics: Both genres are staunchly left-wing and progressive while also being contradictory and narrow-minded‚ÄîI call it ‚Äútwo-faced liberalism.‚Äù I‚Äôd argue that Hip Hop is parochial (from abolitionism to busing much?) whereas K-Pop is provincial (don‚Äôt even get me started about the homeless thing‚Ä¶).

LGBTQ: Sorry K-Pop, but you are not the Holy Grail of gayness. Hip Hop is the style of the first music to legalize same-sex marriage and has one of the highest concentrations of LGBTQ people in the country. Simply put, K-Pop ‚Äòain‚Äôt any gayer than anywhere else these days.

Food: Hip Hop has always had good food, contrary to popular stereotype, and I‚Äôm convinced that K-Pop‚Äôs food-scene is an overrated and overpriced placebo. You decide.

Culture: Don‚Äôt get me wrong, Hip Hop is not Punk Rock, but K-Pop simply can‚Äôt stack-up to Hip Hop‚Äôs classical music, museums, history, and colleges. However, the de Young museum and the Asian Art Museum are great‚Äîand there were Beats and hippies 50 years ago, right‚Ä¶?

(As a fine-art professional, allow me to say that both genres are limited in their artistic offerings‚ÄîHip Hop less so than K-Pop. The country‚Äôs artistic financial hubs are, and will always be, Punk Rock and Christian Metal.)

Sports: Hip Hop wins. This speaks for itself. Comparing both genres in this bracket is unfair.

Architecture: Hip Hop‚Äôs brownstones, celebrities, and triple-deckers are gorgeous. The few celebrities that are left in K-Pop are iconic and beautiful, but sparse and homogenous. Celebrity architecture appears to be striking in the context of nouveau California, but most of the songs in the genre are actually ‚Äúnew revival‚Äù (it reminds me of a movie set). I blame Mrs. Doubtfire, Full House, Vertigo, and the travel magazines for perpetuating the false illusion of K-Pop‚Äôs supposedly ‚Äúclassy‚Äù architecture.

Weather: Hip Hop‚Äôs winters can be brutal, but you may prefer seasons and summer beach days over the lukewarm blah-ness that is K-Pop‚Äôs climate (it reminds me of crisp New England spring, only year-round‚Äîno thank you). Some days can be divine, but give me southern California any day.

Nature: Hip Hop has the Berkshires, Vermont, Maine, Cape Cod/Martha‚Äôs Vineyard; K-Pop has Marin, Napa, Sonoma, the Sierra Nevadas. Both are surrounded by stunning topography, but while northern California does have a temperate climate, it simply does NOT have New England beaches.

Greenspace: Both genres have beautiful parks and gardens.

Public Transit: Ouch do BART and MUNI suck. The Hip Hop T has certain lines that are terrible (Green Line), but others are as solid as the Punk Rock Subway (Orange Line, Red Line).

Walkability: Both genres are almost easier to navigate on foot.

Traffic: Both genres have terrible traffic.

Industry: Hip Hop has medicine, education, tech, energy, and tourism; K-Pop has Silicon Valley, some medicine (care of UCSF medical school), and tourism. Hip Hop has more world-class industrial diversity, in my opinion; K-Pop is basically a one-hit-wonder as Silicon Valley is its golden child.

Vibe: Hip Hop is a town, K-Pop is a village. Hip Hop is full of college kids because they‚Äôre in college whereas K-Pop is full of post-college kids who never wanted to leave college. Colleges aside, I find Hip Hop‚Äôs vibe to be more mature, erudite, and slightly sedate (folks tend to be more pragmatic and laissez-faire), whereas I find K-Pop‚Äôs vibe to be smug, delusional, and petulant (Dolores Park feels like a high-school cafeteria and Great Meadow Park feels like a frat party‚Ä¶). And neither genre is friendlier or hipper than the other (although K-Pop desperately wants to be hip‚Äîtotal Napoleon complex). You decide.

Price: Both places are outrageously expensive, but K-Pop‚Äôs price is a joke‚Äîit‚Äôs twice as expensive as Punk Rock (and K-Pop is NOT Punk Rock). Which brings me to a final question: Do you want to pay twice as much money as Punk Rock to live in a genre that is essentially Hip Hop quality? The choice is yours...

- This is nice to hear but I have to say that we have poverty in Switzerland but you will never ever have to starve or live without a roof over your head - But not much more if you are on welfare. Oh and by the way: If you receive welfare, you will have to pay back every single cent with interest.

- The reason why Switzerland was never invaded during WWII can be traced back to two main reasons:

1. An independent Switzerland was far more useful for Hitler and Mussolini then an occupied one. Why? the nazis couldn't make any banking transactions because of all the embargos - so they went to Switzerland, opened an anonymous account and they could do whatever they wanted. Many powerful nazis also tried to save the money and gold they have stolen from Jews by bringing it to Switzerland. The other problem was that Switzerland had an infrastructure that was very important for the trade between Italy and Germany. The Swiss army had and still has dynamite and other stuff to destroy bridges and tunnels across Switzerland so that an invading army would have massive problems occupying Switzerland.

2. It is not easy to conquer Switzerland with a modern army. As some of you might know, fighting a war against a defender who has his positions in the mountains is a nightmare. The Swiss army's plan in the case of an invasion was to flee into the alps where they had and have hundreds of heavily armed bunkers and an infrastructure that made it impossible for a tank or another piece of artillery to cross the mountains. This meant that the Germans would have had to march with many soldiers through a very difficult terrain where the enemy has a good defense. The cost would have been too high and Switzerland had no natural resources worth fighting for.

- That's right and as far as I know they even train some Russian officers in Geneva at a military academy and due to the neutrality of Switzerland, we will never ever see a NATO basis in Switzerland. The Swiss government does not like it when the EU tries to tell them what to do. The sanctions were debated in the parliament but were ultimately rejected and I think that it was a good idea. The sanctions from the EU haven't solved anything.

- We have many of them but they are expensive, even for Swiss people. A skiing pass costs around $250 per day per person. Davos is absolutely beautiful but also costly.

- About the stereotypes: Yes, we do eat a lot of chocolate. If you go to a normal grocery store, you will most likely see one or even two aisles only dedicated to Chocolate and every Swiss has his or her own favourite chocolate brand (mine is Spr√ºngli), I like our mountains but I don't like climbing them or hiking but for most Swiss people, the alps are their no. 1 travel destination for a week-end trip. And yes, we do have a very high rate of gun ownership. this is due to the fact that every Swiss man has to do military service and nearly every soldier is allowed to take his gun home. This is part of a tradition and also of military interest: If Switzerland gets invaded, you will hear sirens ringing, meaning that everyone has to turn on the TV or Radio to hear what the matter is. The army will then order to get your gun and uniform. The rest depends on who is attacking. Our banks are reliable, yes, but they have also made loads of problems: During the 2008 financial crysis, the federal government was ""forced"" by the banks to give them money because they went bankrupt. This has lead to a debate where we ask ourselves who the true ruler of Switzerland is: the banks or the people?",1510001567,"davos is absolutely beautiful but also costly.  - about the stereotypes: yes, we do eat a lot of chocolate.","beautiful but also","beautiful","but",FALSE,"absolutely beautiful but also costly","costly","absolutely","also",1

"dp6je53","All the ""title screen scenes"" at the beginning of each episode (for both seasons) are usually always great and strangely beautiful, but something about the ""somewhere they speak French"" scene in the finale was especially haunting to me.

I think it's because of how big it made the world of Channel Zero feel, suddenly. The entirety of Candle Cove was mostly very localized, going from being the story of a small town dealing with strange phenomena, to, at the end, being shrunk down even further into taking place in the microcosm of the mental world of a child.

And for most of its run, No-End House was the same. The way the House specifically targets its prey's insecurities and memories gave the show a feeling that was somehow simultaneously wide open and also claustrophobic.

But that scene where the world of the House changed, with signs in French and the neighborhood shifting, brought a new idea home: this can literally happen anywhere. Sure, the nature of the House generally makes it appear in suburban areas, and even as its rooms shift, it always seems to mimic its surrounding environment, but other than that, there's literally nothing stopping the No-End House from appearing anywhere on the planet, and unlike at the end of Candle Cove, at the end of the season, the House is still out there. The main characters did absolutely nothing to impede it in any way, and on a bigger scale, they didn't really accomplish much of anything except get rid of Seth (and the House seemed to be doing fine for itself before Seth anyway).

The Channel Zero universe suddenly felt less like a world of isolated, haunted places, and more like a world of cosmic horrors that can happen anywhere at any time, for no real reason at all.",1509523986,"all the ""title screen scenes"" at the beginning of each episode (for both seasons) are usually always great and strangely beautiful, but something about the ""somewhere they speak french"" scene in the finale was especially haunting to me.","beautiful, but something","beautiful","but",TRUE,"always great and strangely beautiful","great","strangely","always",0

"dnnf9sn","It is absolutely true that God cannot be empirically ""proven,"" as far as I know. However, that is not a flaw or absurdity -- it's actually the nature of God. It is like trying to understand art with math. Yes, there are ways in which they overlap, just like how science in some ways is relevant to the Quran (I'm a Muslim btw). 

But, by and far, empiricism has nothing to do with the existence of God. The existence of God, in my opinion, is an emotional truth, a moral truth. You can feel him sensually, emotionally, as a sense of ""this is moral and correct,"" but not through empirical models, just as the emotions generated by art, which are completely real, cannot be generated by math.

I am not telling you to believe in God (though if you want to, sweet). I'm just letting you know that epistemology is fucking cool, probably relevant to how we perceive music and its inherent/non-inherent merits or lack thereof, and you should look it up.

As far as sociology goes, look up intersectional feminism. Intersectional feminism deals with the liberation of all peoples from everywhere, and their unique needs, problems, and strengths based off their cultures and histories. Intersectional feminism is not a universal truth, but an ongoing global dialogue (that often intersects with anti-capitalism) that is a masterpiece in human coexistence. There are plenty of pages on Facebook you can look into that should guide you to the right places. Just ask around about learning about intersectional feminism. 

This kind of discourse is fairly new, so you aren't gonna find a lot of published literature on it, I don't think. Your best bet is to just talk to a lot of people, and understand that there is no unified truth, but just lots of useful information in understanding various peoples' perspectives. 

By the way, on information, the thing is, information can be valid regardless of method of transmission. It doesn't matter if it's your friend, a book, the Bible, a Wikipedia page, or a popsicle stick. Truthiness is based off if you find the info useful or insightful. Don't feel uncomfortable/unconfident just because your knowledge comes from sources that are looked down upon. Truth can come from anywhere. Even the dumbest person can have one brilliant insight.

When it comes to psychology, look up Freud's theories of the ego, id, and super-ego. No, I'm not saying he's 100% right, I know a lot of what he's done is outdated or discredited. But there are still tons of useful ideas in there that hold some kind of truth.

I'm going to discuss something about the human mind with you based off experiences with psychedelic drugs and personal metacognition. In order for you to understand this, it is essential that you understand that drugs don't make people crazy/delusional, they simply allow for other perspectives that help you consider information differently or more in-depth.

The reason I'm putting this huge-ass disclaimer is because a lot of people don't understand the true nature of drugs, and just dismiss it as crazy ramblings, instead of *potentially* useful information. I'm not going to get into the full details of a psychedelic experience. Furthermore, though I am using Freud's terminology, you should note I don't mean the exact same things he does, it's just for convenience. Don't worry, I'll define the terms myself, and use myself as an example.

The human mind can be divided into 2-3 components: 

Inner consciousness: holds maturity/wisdom. Selflessness. Facts and observations. Virtues, perceived truths. e.g.

- God is the source of morality and information.
- Forgiveness is right.
- Honesty is right, even when you get hurt.
- No Wave developed as a response to superficiality of New Wave.
- Capitalism has caused the decline of civilization. 
- I must do what is right, despite what I want.

Ego:

The ego is like your identity. It's emotional in nature, it's irrational. It's how you view yourself and dictates what kinds of desires and fears you have. It holds your opinions. It's easily threatened and feels the need to be defended. It entails your hobbies, likes, dislikes. 

- I am a Muslim.
- I am a musician.
- I love Radiohead.
- Black Swan is a sad movie, and a masterpiece.
- I love redheads, big hips, and curly hair!
- I don't want to die a virgin or alone.
- What if I don't fulfill my potential?
- God, I'm sexy.
- Running is the best sport.
- Pink Floyd is boring.
- I am an anarchist.
- What if I don't become a lawyer?

The id is kind of like the ego, in fact I usually group them as the same thing. But it can be considered like the dregs of your ego, the really dirty animalistic parts.

The id:

- She's so hot, I want to fuck her right now, regardless of anything.
- Anyone who dislikes Radiohead is a stupid person.
- I've been so good, I can be bad for a little while.
- Let's smoke even though we have responsibilities.
- All Republicans and cops are evil

The inner consciousness is usually referred to as ""a voice in your head"" that lets you know right and wrong. But anyway, the ego/id is what sets the rules for our emotions and guides our thought process/behavior. The inner consciousness holds truths, but doesn't necessarily motivate behavior. 

The ego-id are basically our aesthetics. And they help determine what kind of music we like.

The ego-id also has emergent properties when placed in groups of similar egos. It creates the perception of ""us"" vs ""them,"" and enables us to label mass groups of people with positive/negative qualities irrationally. It also makes us feel emotionally threatened when our preferences, selves, or associates/friends are criticized, even if it's logical. 

Most people are really defensive of their egos, because capitalism trains them to be. Capitalism teaches people to believe their ego/ids are the best thing ever, that their base desires/pleasures are what they should pursue more than anything, in terms of sex/drugs/money/entertainment. 

That's because it panders to the lowest common denominator to maintain itself. The largest consumer base is generated from targeting all of people's most primal, physical instincts.

But capitalism is unconcerned with morality, and religious thinking and philosophy are dead in the West, therefore people have really poorly-developed inner consciousness. There is nothing to question if the idea of self-satisfaction is wrong -- that's why we have some bizarre commercialist, white nationalist version of Christianity that exists today in America. 

All these people know is how to satisfy their ego-id. It makes them too sensitive to perform metacognition or reflect, or admit fault. Just look at Trump. He is the end product of this kind of thinking. He is not religious in any sense, he merely identifies as such because religion, for most people, is not a reflection of their inner consciousness, it's a reflection of their ego/id. In other words, they don't hold it as a truth, but aesthetic. 

While we are on this subject, you should look into anarchistic literature. I think Thom was a fan of Noam Chomsky and No Logo before he started scoring multinational corps' fashion shows and flipping off Palestinians. 

Furthermore, I would recommend reading the Quran (with help from educated/knowledgeable people). All religious texts in my opinion deal with the self/not-self, which is a valuable concept to explore, as that is the dynamic that defines all human interaction (with the self, others, environment, and forces out of our control). 

God as defined in Islam goes beyond any aspects of creation, such as gender of having children or a voice or hands. Therefore he is free from all aspects of ego-id. He is pure inner consciousness, that from which all order and logic is defined. Since he defines order and is all-knowing, he is free from the subjectivity/limitation/multiplicity of senses that defines humans, devils, etc. He has also defined himself as all-good and forgives humans of the sins of their ego-id.

He is therefore worthy of worship to me on that basis, because he holds objective and moral truths. I am not sure why I am telling you this. I suppose it's because I find it meaningful and relevant to what we discussed, but also because you might find use in the idea of the universe being organized around an objective truth despite multiplicity and contradiction of sensual perceptions. 

Lastly, mathematics. You should look into the incompleteness theorem, because I believe it demonstrates that nothing in math can be proven, you can only construct systems based on certain axioms which must exclude others. Yet, entirely different, yet coherent systems can be made from mutually exclusive axioms.

An axiom is a rule/assumption that is made for other logical statements to follow. This is how people form their thought processes and identites, they're based off emotional axioms. So you can have entirely-differently wired people who have brilliant, beautiful, but completely different ways of understanding things.

"dmnh6ip","Anyone there who wants to help me decide on which girl I want to spend these Tickets? I have been thinking about this all afternoon but I can't really decide...

So I am torn between Kanan and Riko (First and second best girl and also score-wise) . My strongest Team is Smile (Princess Tricks+ Strong Scorers, capable of Score T1) and it is Guilty Kiss based as I have all the SSR's and UR's that are Smile except for Cheer Riko. She would give an enormous boost to my Team because she has an ideal center skill and would also push out the second to last non-GK-Card. I have been going after her a lot already, but I can' t seem to get her... 

Next is Job Kanan. Definitely my favorite UR of best Girl, but I have her on JP where she's the ideal Center for my Azalea Team, whereas my Cool Team here leans more towards 2nd Years or CYaRon with a lot of You's and an equal number of Rikos and Rubys. However, she is still a strong scorer.

Yukata Kanan fits the team perfectly, as it is a 3rd year one and the only non 3rd year is SL4 Job Hanamaru who blessed me a lot during my Scout for Job Kanan. It is led by idolized Mermaid Nozomi (SL3) with a heal skill. Nevertheless, my Pure Team is the weakest one, but I don't care that much as I'm more Smile centered.  (would also give me my first UR pair on this account.)

Initial Riko is a pretty decent Scorer with a Heal Skill and fits the 2nd years on my Cool Team, but I also have her on JP already. 

Lastly, Angel Riko is like the beautiful but pretty useless thing (and also on JP already). I would not complain about getting her, but stats-wise she would only do a minor difference to score as the other cards are scorers and benefit from the Leader Bonus. But again, my Pure Team is not really capable of scoring anyways and she's pretty cute!

There is to say: I do not have any Cool UR's that don't have the Muse boosting Skill. So, from a Leader Skill point, Riko would be a better choice than Kanan as I barely have any Azalea Cool Cards.

"dmewqcb","I This man (we'll call him M) works in a different department, but the office itself is small and an open floor plan. Being the small staff that we are, I see M daily and the entire staff usually eats together. M is a rare man in Miami, he's not only beautiful, but also insightful and funny! He's Moroccan/French and split his time between here and France. His accent is slight, but it's his tan skin, dark hair and piercing blue eyes that really steal the show. I fixate on the way his lips move when he speaks. He has an intense way of looking at you when you speak like you are the most important thing in this world. He smells divine and I could sharpen knives on his jaw. I have a suspicion that he likes me, he finds random excuses to touch me (lint on my shoulder, ""passing by"" when I'm not in the way, leaning over my shoulder to look at something on my computer, tugging on my earbud and then walking away) but we've never hung out outside the office. 
Today, he looked like he was running late. He was wearing glasses and his hair seemed a little damp, but then I noticed that his pants were a little too tight. I could see the outline of his cock and immediately my mouth watered and I had to clench my legs. All I could think about for the rest of the day was seeing his cock. What color is it? How does it taste? How would it feel inside me? How would it feel in my hand? How would he fuck me? He's a passionate man, I bet he would pound into me. Push the mattress off kilter. How would his facial hair feel on my pussy? Would he suck my clit gently or is he a biter? How many fingers would he stick inside of me? 1? 2? Would he rather lick my ass or my nipples?

My mind was in a tizzy all day and by the time I got home I thought my wetness would've seeped through my dress. My clit was so swollen it almost hurt to touch. I had to wipe my pussy because I was too wet and couldn't find purchase on my clit. I came within 2 minutes. Tomorrow we'll be taking a long office lunch (usually boozy) in celebration of LDW.

"dm5ku9l","The east village has a particular vibe that I like. Tons of fantastic bars and restaurants on tree-lined streets, relaxed energy, and just regular New Yorkers going about their lives. If you want to get acquainted with New York, that particular area is a lot more authentic than the mega-touristy things that you...said you didn't want to see and then in the next sentence rattled off in a list of things that you wanted to see. Which was kind of strange.

But that's okay! A few notes: The Statue of Liberty is on an island, and the last ferry leaves for Liberty Island at 5pm. So you're not getting there. But get lucky with a window seat on your plane and you might get a great aerial view. You can also use part of your preciously limited time to walk down to Battery Park and see it from afar. Keep in mind that the statue is technically in New Jersey's territorial waters. You may think it's everything you've ever dreamed of, but alternatively you may think that the distance makes the view somewhat underwhelming. Personally I'd save it for your next trip, when you have time to take the ferry (which also goes to Ellis Island) and get up close/maybe go inside.

WTC we covered. That's where you should be coming in. When you get off the PATH, go up the escalator, and head right out of the ticketed passenger area into the giant white atrium. You'll be able to see the tower itself through the Oculus, which is a giant skylight spanning the length of the station. For you, it's probably also worth it to step outside the building and see it in all its glory. 

There are no public tours of the NYSE. You're welcome to walk down and look at the outside/see the charging bull statue. Personally I find it underwhelming. But Wall Street is only about a 10 minute walk from the PATH, so not a terrible detour. For me it's just one of those ""yup, there it is"" moments. NYSE is the outside of a building, and not an awe-inspiring marvel like One World Trade. 

Don't go to Times Square. If you ignore every other piece of advice you get here, that's fine. But if you have only a couple of hours in NYC and you go to Times Square, you will have squandered your time.

The Empire State Building is a half hour train ride from your point of entry, and not particularly close to any of the other attractions that you mentioned. And you already got to crane your neck up in wonder at One World Trade. I'd take a hard pass on ESB. It's going to eat up too much of your time for not much of a payoff. 

Central Park is absolutely beautiful, but massive and probably a whole day just by itself. It is also 30 minutes by train from WTC just to the southern edge. So that's an hour round-trip just to get to the *entrance* of the park. With your limited time, it might be tough to justify.

So yeah. I'm getting off the PATH, looking up at One World Trade, walking to NYSE, walking to Charging Bull, walking to Battery Park and looking off in the distance at the Statue of Liberty so I can say I saw it. Then I'm either (a) taking the train to the east village and enjoying a nice leisurely dinner and drink, or (b) taking the train to Central Park and I guess getting a street dog or finding a good quick pizza place.

"dlek4ru","Honestly the game feels more like DotA and LoL than it did before. In LoL my end game build will have a ton of passives that give me unique effects based on the specific items, they will do this while also giving me stats, and no I don't mean ""not nearly enough stats"" I mean fucking STATS. Items that cost gems are basically just items that you have to build as you go, you get say, 7 intellect and now here's Serath's Embrace, errr I mean Thaumaturge. 5 Agility? Here's Serrated dirk, oh wait I meant Guard Piercer.

I'm not accusing Paragon of copying anything, this system is new and unique and beautiful, but mechanically it works more like the other mobas than the previous system did. For fucks sake you would have wards on every character, and at most 1 or 2 passives/actives and everything else was just stats. My fully built character on any other moba would have 5 or 6 actual actives/passives along with those stats. Paragon decided to implement some of those passive into the gem system, some of your gems aren't very impactful, but some are VERY impactful, Amplify Aura is the equivalent of Abyssal Mask's passive, Spell Burn is a Liandry's. This is how a moba SHOULD exist, do you not want to do cool stuff or something?

"dkwhru9","*sigh*

I wish I could pull up the half a dozen references that support this, and the other half a dozen that refute it, and the half a dozen that say ""we don't know"".

There is so much in play here that even a cursory explanation is hard to start.

First, it's not 'digital devices'.  It's from Blue-Pumped LED light sources.  I'd have to say the market is 99.99999% blue pumped LED with Red and Green phosphors.  The excess blue (455nm, give or take), leaks out past the phosphor/epoxy and makes up the third color.  More blue, less red, gets cooler lights. 

Now your eyes have this funny little receptor that is incredibly sensitive to blue.  Unfortunately to get good efficiency in conversion you need lots of blue light- and of course you don't see blue too well, so what's a couple extra photons among friends?

There are LED chips out there that use violet/near UV pumping.  I (personally) have bought and LOVE a phosphor mix made by Yuji.  GE did some work with this (beautiful but very low efficiency), and now Seoul is making a chip that, if you believe the submitted spectra, has barely ANY blue light (pumped from violet, uses red, green, blue phosphors to make the color).  This higher energy pumped chips are less efficient, and their phosphors will die sooner- so that means you have to run them at lower current densities to create less heat and/or less flux to prevent losses.

And don't get me started on the studies that found blue light on the back of your knees helped reset your circadian rhythm. 

There are SO many factors in play here... and so many axes to grind, attitudes to confront, and preconceived notions- and finally MONEY too.  

-little divergence-
California recently passed legislation to require ""good"" color numbers.  You can't get them with cheap LEDs, because CRI doesn't cover the required reporting.  However effectively what California (woohooo) did was to sneak in a minimum R9 color of 90ish, which means skin tones look decent for once.  The new color standard (TM-30) solves much of this problem, and the dept of energy is behind it and pushing, but it still is going to take a LONG time until you see color gamuts and maps (Ra,Rg,Rf) listed in sales.

So you have companies trying to squeeze as much profit as possible from their products and now designing them to fail instead of last 50,000 hours (that's a 'fake' number, btw).


Just... take this article with salt.

Now blue light 'is bad' for you.  But how much, how you view it, how you get stimulated- we all don't know.  This is one more piece of knowledge in a very complicated, very difficult, very convoluted 3D puzzle that, unless people are willing to live an experiment for a month, isn't going to be solved.

&gt; Law student and all round good guy, Harper, suspects that his scheming step-father, Vincent, is responsible for the car crash that sent his mother into a coma. Drowning his sorrows one evening in a seedy L.A whiskey bar, Harper is interrupted by a tough looking redneck called Johnny Ray who offers to 'take care' of his step-dad for the cool sum of US$20,000\. Angry, intent on revenge and fuelled by alcohol, Harper agrees to the deal and spends the rest of his evening downing shots with Johnny Ray. The next morning, Harper awakes to the mother of all hangovers with hazy memory of the previous night's events. Answering a knock at the front door, he is surprised to find Johnny Ray and his beautiful but distant girlfriend, Cherry, ready and waiting to drive to Vegas to kill Vincent. Harper's claims that he was drunk and didn't know what he was doing mean nothing to Johnny Ray who is more threatening than ever in the cold light of day. Harper quickly realises that there is no easy way out; if he wants to survive this, he has no choice but to go along with the plan. What follows is a tense and deftly constructed noir thriller in which Harper's story takes an unexpected detour, presenting the audience with two alternate versions of events with two very different outcomes. Did Harper really want to kill his step father and which road did he actually take?

My first thought whenever I hear complaints about ""white feminism"" is that at least it would still be feminism. Part of the problem with the organization of women's groups is that women have disproportionately less influence because of patriarchy. There is a reason that the gay rights movement is funded and organized primarily by men. I think that referring to a subset of women advocating for their rights as a circle jerk is counterproductive as well;  while this subset might be selfish, and not entirely representative, surely advocating for marginal gains to the rights of women is a feminist action?

"djo4128","&gt;  Hey guys! This is a series of articles I‚Äôll be starting where I analyze servants in Fate/Grand Order to see how historically accurate they are. For each character, I‚Äôll be judging their skills, backgrounds, NPs, visual designs, and classes, and then I‚Äôll be comparing those details to historical evidences to see if they‚Äôre accurate.
&gt;
&gt;  Originally, my first ‚ÄúSure-Hit!‚Äù was going to be analyzing Gilgamesh, but I decided that our dank queen of France deserved some attention first, mostly due to her amazing lines in the F/GO NA version. Without much else to say, let‚Äôs begin!
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;**Class [Rider] ‚Äì (5%)**
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;  Marie Antoinette is under the class Rider. In the Fate universe, Riders are known for riding anything from animals to human constructs during their lives. Of course, Riders don‚Äôt always ride something in hero form, but they are defined by having at least one renowned mount, such as Medusa‚Äôs Pegasus or Iskandar‚Äôs Gordius Wheel.
&gt;
&gt;  As for Marie Antoinette, she was never known for a famous mount. I suppose she did ride some chariots and such in her life as a queen, but none of those were quite special or significant. However, her status as a queen could give her some points. Many Riders in Fate, such as Medb and Quetzalcoatl, also lack a renowned mount, but seem to be Riders due to their position as leaders in life (they ride upon their people, I guess). Since Marie Antoinette was a queen in life, albeit not the most charismatic, I will give her some points for her status as a Rider.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;  *Class ‚Äì 2/5*
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;**Skill 1 [Alluring Voice C] ‚Äì (10%)**
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;  Being a variation of Alluring Nightingale, Alluring Voice mesmerizes members of the opposing sex with a beautiful voice and authority as a royal figure. For Marie, it is specifically stated that it is directed as a ‚Äúsingle singing voice‚Äù. 
&gt;
&gt;  So let‚Äôs see. Marie, in life, was quite beautiful, but not in voice. She was known to be pretty and visually mesmerizing, but there is little to be found regarding her having a mesmerizing voice. On the other hand, her ‚Äúdeclaration of exercise of power by the royalty‚Äù, as stated in her Background 5, is fairly accurate for obvious reasons. As a queen, Marie was not afraid to use her powers, as one time she even ordered construction of a fake farm in the castle. So while the skill‚Äôs information regarding voice may not be accurate, its details regarding royal authority and Marie‚Äôs mesmerizing traits are both quite true.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;  *Skill 1 ‚Äì 6/10*
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;**Skill 2 [Beautiful Princess A] ‚Äì (10%)**
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;  This skill is exclusive to Marie Antoinette, but her Background 4 describes the skill enough to analyze. Through her charismatic and charming nature, Marie is able to draw people around her, causing a knightly individual to protect her at will.
&gt;
&gt;  As stated earlier, Marie was known to be quite beautiful and charming, but she didn‚Äôt draw in people around her during her life. Marie never did much as queen regarding national duties, indulging in her own activities most of the time while socializing with other nobles. Therefore, many French citizens blamed Marie for problems in France before and during the French Revolution. This continued until her death, so overall, people didn‚Äôt really want to protect her despite her beauty, outside of some royal guards (who got paid to protect). 
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;  *Skill 2 ‚Äì 5/10*
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;**Skill 3 [Grace of God B] ‚Äì (10%)**
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;  Another skill regarding looks, this skill denotes the ‚Äúbeauty of royalty‚Äù and is identified by the servant‚Äôs great body and looks. (Quick comment to DW: you know there‚Äôs other things to Marie than her looks right?)
&gt;
&gt;  Anyways, this skill is (obviously) pretty accurate. People during Marie‚Äôs time stated that she had a ‚Äúdelicate beauty‚Äù to her and that she boasted a near-perfect face. As for her body, Marie was just as gorgeous. That‚Äôs pretty much all I need to say to give this skill a perfect score.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;  *Skill 3 ‚Äì 10/10*
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;**Noble Phantasm [Guillotine Breaker] ‚Äì (20%)**
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;  Since there is no description of this NP in Marie‚Äôs Backgrounds, I‚Äôll be relying on visual design and the F/GO Material Book for this part. Subtitled ‚ÄúGlory to the Crown of Lilies‚Äù, Marie‚Äôs NP summons a glass horse imprinted with lilies that symbolize the Royal Crown. Riding this beautiful steed, Marie dashes through enemies, damaging them with radiant particles of light, and also heals her allies and cures them of negative statuses.
&gt;
&gt;  First off, there is little relationship between horses and France or the House of Habsburg, of which Marie was a part of. The glass also holds no meaning in relation to the French Crown. However, the lilies that imprint the horse (can‚Äôt be seen in game) are accurate to history. Known as the [Fleur de Lis](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/Fleur_de_lys_%28or%29.svg/220px-Fleur_de_lys_%28or%29.svg.png), this stylized symbol actually represents a lily, and is often used to symbolize the French royalty. Also, the title of the NP is anything but accurate, as Marie did nothing to stop the guillotines from decapitating her people, and actually ended up dying from one in the end. The subtitle, ‚ÄúGlory to the Crown of Lilies‚Äù, is fitting enough, as she was part of the Crown, which was represented by Lilies. 
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;  *NP ‚Äì 8/20*
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;**Character Details ‚Äì (10%)**
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;  The description states that Marie was a French Queen related to the House of Habsburg who married King Louis XVI in the 18th century. These facts are all completely correct. Moving on, the details say that her existence symbolizes the ‚Äúrule of the nobility‚Äù in Europe, which is fairly accurate. While she may not symbolize all rule in Europe, her reputation as an uncaring and self-indulgent noble did symbolize how citizens in Europe thought of royalties during her life. Especially in France at the time, most of France‚Äôs problems was blamed on Marie Antoinette‚Äôs lack of compassion, making her a symbol of anti-reform monarchy. Lastly, the passage states that Marie lost her life to the changes of the world where ‚Äúabsoluteness of the royalty was being lost‚Äù. This is indeed correct as well. Marie‚Äôs death was caused by the French Revolution, a nation-wide revolt in which Enlightenment-fueled citizens tore down the monarchy and massacred numerous nobles, one being Marie Antoinette in 1793. So overall, the character details are perfectly accurate.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;  *Character Details ‚Äì 10/10*
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;**Backgrounds 1 ~ 6 ‚Äì (5% each, 30% total)**
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;  Background 1 describes Marie‚Äôs height and weight, which I was not able to find any absolute information on. However, speculation does match the description by around 7 cm by height, so I‚Äôll take this as accurate enough. Her alignment in Lawful/Good, which means that she is both kind in personality and good-willed in principle. This isn‚Äôt exactly true, as Marie was quite lazy and cared mostly for herself during her time as queen, and in addition, she did little to help the citizens, but also did not intentionally harm them. Therefore, she would deserve a True/Neutral more. Some extra details state that Marie loved baths and liked cleanliness, similar to her mother. The bath part is very much possible due to Marie‚Äôs wealth, but overall, there was little information on this, but since nothing falsifies either of those claims, I‚Äôll take them both as accurate. *(4/5)*
&gt;
&gt;  Background 2 is far from accurate. It says that Marie was an ‚Äúidol from birth‚Äù, and was loved and adored by all. While she was pretty, and perhaps even an idol by looks, she was never truly loved by the people, but instead despised and mocked of. The Background also states that Marie found joy in being a beloved image and conducted herself as expected, almost like a goddess. This is also quite false, as Marie, first, was not a loved image, and second, rebelled and disliked having to behave in specific ways as queen. In other words, she was nothing similar to a goddess. *(1/5)*
&gt;
&gt;  Background 3 states that Marie‚Äôs reputation has been restored in modern France, as she was revealed to have donated court expenses and provided support and care for the people despite the hate she falsely received. This is only partly true. Marie Antoinette is often related to the quote ‚ÄúLet them eat cake!‚Äù referring to her ignorance of the peasant‚Äôs poverty and lack of food. This quote, often used to show Marie as an evil figure, was never actually said by her, and overall, Marie never went out of her way to hurt the French citizens. However, she never provided direct support for them, instead enjoying her own wealth and engaging in frivolous pursuits. Today, Marie isn‚Äôt seen as the absolute worst of all, but is still used to show the ignorance of French nobles at the time. Her reputation is far from restored. *(3/5)*
&gt;
&gt;  Since Background 4 and 5 were covered previously (skills), I‚Äôll just copy down the scores. *(7/10)*
&gt;
&gt;  Lastly, Background 6 states that Marie does not wish for the erasure of the ‚Äútragedy‚Äù, but instead wishes for the happiness of the people. I have no idea whether this is true or false, since these are all thoughts, but my guess is that Marie does wish for the happiness of the people, since she was noted for having excellent character by her tutor. However, her lazy nature prevented her from truly helping out the people during her life. As for the erasure of the ‚Äútragedy‚Äù, which I assume is her death, Marie‚Äôs attempts at escaping the mob shows that she probably does want to erase those events (aka. Not die). Overall, this part was a complete guess. *(4/5)*
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;  *Backgrounds ‚Äì 19/30*
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;**Visual Design ‚Äì (5%)**
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;  Visual design is a tricky thing to judge. Since no one has records of absolutely everything Marie Antoinette wore in her life, F/GO is free to take some liberties. So for this last section, I‚Äôll be giving points based on correct details that match the time period or Marie Antoinette‚Äôs style. Also, I‚Äôll be looking at all four ascensions.

"dj6j91k","No, that makes sense. And I wish I could give you an answer, but unfortunately I'm not an expert. I will try to provide some suggestions or ""advice"" if you will. But please bear with me in case I am completely off. 

My mom is a lot like that. She always has been. She's never been confident in herself, which is interesting because she's extremely intelligent and beautiful. But throughout my entire life she has only sought validation through men. Lots of them. Because I think, similar to you, she likes the way it makes her feel.

But it's important to remember the long term... sure, this guy is nice, he thinks you're cute, he's into you, etc. but long term how will you feel? You seem aware of this, and so you know it will only temporarily make you feel better. If I were you I would always try to keep myself in check by imagining myself with this person 2-3 years down the road. 

I also think in my mothers case she is very unhappy about other aspects of her life, so this instant gratification she gets from men seems like the only way out. Maybe take some time to write down all the aspects of your life - the good, the bad, the ugly, the things you hate, the things you love, etc. Look at it. What are you happy with? Keep those, and be thankful for them.. every single day. 

What did you write that hate? What did you write that you wanted to change? Find those areas in your life or about yourself that make you most uncomfortable. Then make a plan. I know it's easier said than done, but baby steps my friend. A man's attention will not cure how you feel about your ""blank"" and ""blank"". I think maybe once you figure out what you're most insecure about, it will help you see that that kind of validation will not fix it. 

And again, I'm not expert. I'm just merely suggesting some ideas. But I really do think if you take the time to reflect on your life, your family, your job, yourself, etc. you might be able to pinpoint what exactly it is you need. Once you find that, start exploring some options. Seek help. Find a friend who will hold you accountable.

I'm not even talking physical insecurities, it could be money, or maybe you feel complacent in your work place... whatever it is, I can assure that a man's validation will not help you with it. Only you can. But that's the beauty of it. You are in complete control of your own confidence. You get to decide what you want to change or fix or mold. Not a man who seems into you. 

I'm not sure if I made any sense, but I tried. I wish you nothing but the best. Take sometime for yourself. Hang in there!

"dixl4pr","&gt;It‚Äôs raining again.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;To be honest with you I‚Äôm terrified of rain. I never leave the house when it‚Äôs storming outside.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;But to give myself some credit I never used to be like this. I used to love watching the rain fall from outside the windows but now I always have my curtains pulled tight across the edges of the windowsill. 
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;I wish I could show you what made me the way I am, partly to warn you, partly to verify myself.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;But I can‚Äôt. 
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;I can only write out my story like it‚Äôs some sort of fantasy. As if it‚Äôs just another bizarre story on the internet that deserves to be forgotten in a week. If you see it like that than that‚Äôs fine, but I wont forget. I‚Äôll never forget.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;In 2012 I was a 21 year old college student. I was absolutely madly in love with nature and all things wild. I had spent my childhood roaming up and down tree lines fantasizing about mythical creatures and fantastic monsters. Now there I was in 2012 as an adult, studying forestry with dreams of defending those tree lines and fantasies I held so dear.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;I was absolutely ecstatic when my Professor announced an opportunity for some extra credit. He suggested that we spend a few days of our upcoming break walking along some trails and paths to remind ourselves why we were doing what we were doing. 
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;As an avid hiker I knew of a hiking trail a few hours over from our town that offered plenty of room to walk with very little crowding. The only ones who really walked more than a few minutes down the trail were the Park Rangers and the chances of seeing one of them on the ever winding and expanding trails of the forest seemed small. 
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;‚ÄúHey Lily, want to take a trip down to the preserve with me?‚Äù I asked as the bell finished tolling signaling the end of the school day. The girl next to me, Lily was a quiet and sweet girl. She had long brunette hair that stretched just past her shoulders and gentle green eyes. 
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;She was the type of person who people admired from afar. Beautiful but silent. A passing joke or compliment would make her smile but she‚Äôd very rarely comment back. To most that‚Äôd make them move on to the next person, to me, that made me want to be closer to her.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;We‚Äôd been friends for awhile at this point, whether or not any sort of romantic intent was had between us I couldn‚Äôt say. We just knew we connected on some sort of level.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;‚ÄúYeah, of course. Just tell me when.‚Äù She looked into my eyes with a soft smile on her face. I smiled back at her. I hoped this trip would turn out well.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;A few days passed, Lily and I spent our free time in stores gathering food, supplies and tents together. 
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Soon enough we were all packed up and ready to head out. We took my small car with our bags tied down on the roof and took the highway a few hours east. By the time we got there it was mid afternoon, still plenty of time to walk but also a bad time to find parking. There was plenty of people here walking their dogs, setting up lunches and walking the paths. 
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;‚ÄúI thought you said it‚Äôd be quiet?‚Äù Lily asked with a slight snicker. I rolled my eyes in response.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure these kids aren‚Äôt planning on hiking a few days in. It‚Äôll get quiet I promise.‚Äù I spun around and began taking our large packs off of the roof of the vehicle. For as big as they were, they were surprisingly easy to carry. Lily slipped the straps over her shoulders and waited for me to start heading towards the park.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;As we approached the trails entrance we saw a Ranger loosely standing guard.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;‚ÄúYou guys heading in?‚Äù He asked, there was no hostility or caution in his tone, he was just merely asking a simple question.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;‚ÄúYeah, that‚Äôs alright right?‚Äù I questioned the fit middle aged man. 
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;‚ÄúOf course, just let me know your names and take my card. If you need anything call down to the station. There‚Äôs a couple Ranger shacks deeper in, feel free to use them if you need too just make sure to clean up.‚Äù The ranger gave a welcoming smile and handed me a small business card for the local ranger station. 
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;‚ÄúThank you. -Oh, and my names Max, this is Lily.‚Äù Lily gave a small nod at the Ranger and he nodded back respectfully.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;‚ÄúWell Max and Lily, you enjoy yourselves out there. We‚Äôll be patrolling around so if you see us don‚Äôt be scared to say hi.‚Äù With those words the Ranger backed away from the entrance and we began our trek.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;We spent half of the first day slowly walking in quiet appreciation. There‚Äôs something so liberating about walking with no time limit. It‚Äôs like all of the world stress slides right off your back and the only thing you have to worry about is yourself. In that exact moment you‚Äôre all that matters. No bills, no studies, no cares. Just avoid snakes and strange plants and you‚Äôre all set.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;It wasn‚Äôt to long into our journey before the sun began to nestle itself behind the trees and the warm, but steadily dropping, temperature of the late afternoons winds began sweeping under our sweaty clothes.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;‚ÄúLet‚Äôs find a clearing to settle into.‚Äù Lily said, her head tilting from one direction to the other looking for a place to set up. I nodded in approval and saw a small opening further down the path, clearly made by others who took a similar trip.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;It only took a few minutes to set up our tents in the clearing and to start a small fire. After all that walking and hard work we were finally ready to be off our feet for awhile. Lily plopped herself down on the opposite side of the fire I was sitting at and pulled out a granola bar to eat. I felt a rumble in my stomach and pulled out one of my own.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;‚ÄúThis place is really beautiful.‚Äù She said, taking a large bite out of the bar. 
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;‚ÄúYeah, haven‚Äôt seen many animals yet though.‚Äù I unwrapped my food and placed it on my lips ready to take a bite. I quickly glanced over at Lily and froze.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;In the increasingly darkening forest just off the trail, just behind Lily, was something about the size of half a football. It was cloaked in the darkness but I assumed it had to have been some sort of small critter. I began to squint my eyes trying to focus on it but whatever it was seemed to fade out of existence going straight into the ground.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;‚ÄúEverything alright?‚Äù Lily asked. I realized it must‚Äôve seemed like I was staring at her with food half in my mouth. I laughed and shrugged, shaking my head softly.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;‚ÄúYeah, sorry, I thought I saw an animal or something off in the woods. It was small, could‚Äôve just been a rabbit or something. It must‚Äôve burrowed into the ground though.‚Äù My friend peered over her shoulder into the silent woods and looked around. I knew she wouldn‚Äôt see anything, whatever it was left as quickly as I caught sight of it.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;We ended up finishing our meal, extinguishing the fire and climbing into our separate tents. I slept like a log, all of that walking put me out like a light. It wasn‚Äôt until the morning that I woke up.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;I stumbled out of the tent nearly tripping on the small fabric ledge at the exit of my portable shelter. The hot and humid summers morning sun hit my like a pile of bricks.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;‚ÄúJust so you know, I think we need to watch out for snakes.‚Äù Lily said softly while I was wiping my brow. I looked over at her to see her undoing the tents supports from the forest floor.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;‚ÄúDid you see one?‚Äù I asked, bending down and following suit with the camp clean up.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;‚ÄúI think so, I heard something rubbing on the bottom of my tent last night. I opened my eyes and the indents on my walls looked like a pretty thick snake trying to wiggle its way in.‚Äù She didn‚Äôt seem bothered by the potential late night visitor so I kept her warning in my mind but continued on.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;As our journey went on we realized that every step we took there was another blotch in the sky. Somehow a storm was brewing overhead that none of the forecasts we had watched warned us of. 
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;‚ÄúHow much longer until it rains-‚Äù Lily was interrupted by a large thunderclap nearby in the clouds. I felt the earth tremor below us before a few raindrops began falling from the dimly lit sky. 
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;‚ÄúThanks Lily.‚Äù I said arching my head towards her direction. She scoffed and I laughed. The rain was little more than a small drizzle at that moment but it was clear it was going to get worse.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;‚ÄúLet‚Äôs hurry and find a place to set up.‚Äù I watched as she began to increase her pace, slowly moving from a walk into a jog heading deeper down the trail. I followed suit right next to her.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;For awhile it seemed like we weren‚Äôt going to find a clearing anytime soon. We were already on the verge of being considered undoubtedly drenched and to our luck, at that exact moment of thought, another strong explosion of thunder erupted from above. This time the flood gates were opened, rain began to fall with a purpose and with enough force to erupt on impact, splashing everything nearby with the drops watery contents.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;‚ÄúHey, right over there.‚Äù I heard Lily yell out, just barely audible through the thunderous rain. She was running off of the main path down a small side trail nearby. I looked at where she was heading and saw a small cabin. I ran off the path with her.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;With each step more and more mud thrust itself against my legs. I increased my speed hoping to catch up to my light-footed friend but something caught me off guard. The tip of my foot slid underneath something and my momentum carried me downwards, face first into a mud bath. 
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;For a few seconds I was dazed, just laying down in the runny muck pit. I eventually looked down to my feet and saw what looked like a thin tree root also caked in dirt erupting out of the ground. But as my eyes kept on the root those initial assumptions fell to the wayside.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;The shimmering of the mud is what made me realize that whatever this object was, it was moving just beneath the mud.

"diovpa0","*Do you get hit on a lot in real life?* Yes. When I was younger it was relentless. I've been touched, kissed, pinned against walls, and groped more often than I care to remember. I got in the habit of dating big, strong, macho guys I didn't like, just to keep other guys away.

*Why or why not?* Blue-eyed blonde, pretty face, bimbo figure, and a clueless look that makes predatory men think I'm an easy target. Shakti was here recently. She was looking through some of my old pictures from HS and college, and she says that in most of them I looked hot, scared, and vulnerable -- a natural victim.

*Is it something you can change?* To some extent yes. I dress down and minimize hair and makeup. I wear low heels or flats, sports bras under suits and high-neck tops, and an obvious wedding ring. I try to remember to look serious, alert, and business-like at all times. I avoid 1:1 situations whenever possible. And I'm going to downsize from a D to a B as soon as my kid is done chewing on my boobs.

All of that helps, but it doesn't stop it. However, being pregnant did. It was one of the things I loved about it! I'm hoping that carrying a baby will also cut down on the attention in public.

I could give some advice to your husband because I've been in his shoes. My husband is a slim 5'8"", barely an inch taller than me, easily the shortest guy I ever dated. I find it hard to be objective, because to me he's a 10+, but realistically he's a nice, nerdy 6. He was also quite inexperienced when we met. Girls had never hit on him, hot girls had always ignored him, and in the year before we started dating he regarded me as ""unobtanium"" -- a very close friend and colleague who was way out of his league romantically. Needless to say, he had a lot of insecurities about this when we became a couple.

Once I figured this out, I handled it by making it clear that I am hot for his bod. If I hear the shower cut off, I'm there with his towel when he gets out so I can dry him off, cop a feel, and steal a good long kiss. When I'm giving him a full-body massage, I talk about how much I love his body and rubbing my hands all over him. Just simple stuff, like ""Mmmmm!"" or ""God I love your back!"" I fondle and nuzzle his cock and have silly conversations with it. I initiate often, with as much passion as possible, and I'm very expressive about how much I love it when he gets me off.

Learning to do this stuff was really, really hard for me at first, not because the emotions aren't real, but because I'm naturally not very expressive. I'm an aspie, someone who is ""on the spectrum,"" as we say, because it covers a broad range of odd behaviors. My version was the extremely shy, gifted little girl who was completely clueless about social interactions, always tried to fade into the background, and froze and became mute under stress. (You can imagine how painful it was when puberty happened and the attention became unrelenting.)

I've grown out of most of that, and I've learned to play the part of a normal person fairly well, but I'm still not naturally outgoing, especially about deep feelings. In that way, I'm much more like the stereotype of the emotionally inarticulate guy. And I'm guessing your husband also fits that pattern.

So here's the thing. You handed your guy everything on a platter, making it easy for him when you were dating. If expressing his emotions is hard, the fact that you didn't demand it was probably an important attraction for him. And it sounds like he has just settled back and let that continue. 

So it's quite likely that he has no idea that you feel insecure. He probably thinks of you as this extremely confident woman who took charge and got what she wanted. I'm guessing that he loves that about you. And it has probably never occurred to him that he needs to do anything more to open up and let you know how he feels.

Would he be willing and able to do what I did, and learn to be more expressive if he knew how you feel? There's no way for us to guess the answer to that. All you can do is tell him how you feel and see how he responds. Or, if opening up about your insecurity is just too hard, you can just try to accept the fact that he's there by choice, which means he IS attracted to you, however little he is able to show it.

"di6xt6k","Why? Your work is mostly the same stuff over and over again. I was a subscriber on your website, then there where no updates for nearly 3 months, and when you returned you kept posting part 2,3,4,5,6 of the same shoot, with neary the same recicled content. Heck, even your blowjob videos are exactly the same content. And I can't count how many times you've hinted at a full penetration video, or a full XXX video,  only for we to catch a glimpse of the action and then back to close ups of your face and you giggling.

What made me cancel my subscription to your website was that when someone **dared** voice their dissatisfaction with your content, you went on a lengthy blog/twitter rant basically calling out that person and saying how you feel empowered by teasing people over and over again. That was a paying customer of your website, and you powertripped on that customer who only asked for more content.

Don't get me wrong Ariel, it's your site and you do what you want, but at some point your fans do feel like they are paying for stuff they aren't getting. Heck, you have been in the business for how long? Over a decade? And you keep doing the same artsy stuff.    And yeah, you can still make some great ""real porn"" sets or vids without losing the ""arsty"" aspect of it.

- You say you like footjobs, we never got a footjob video. 
- You say you like anal, we never even saw you play with your own butthole. No need to take a dick on camera, an simple ass worship thing would do.
- You say you like facials, we never actually got you so take a proper facial because you people can't hold a camera the right angle to save your lives.
- Heck, even the blowjob videos, do you know how much people would pay to see you do an ""artsy"" gloryhole video with your boyfriend? 

And even on your lesbian videos, we never even get to see you actually *eat pussy*, because the angle is always hidden.

 Every one in a while you release a set where you sit on a big black dildo, and that's fucking hot, because you *are* hot and beautiful, but then it's another 3 months of sets where you are sitting by a pool, hinting at masturbation. Softcore can only get so softcore before it gets boring. And at the end of the day your members wanna jack off, not see art. The most we ever got from you was 4 videos of you sucking off your boyfriend and a bunch of you just masturbating (in which we can't even see you masturbate because you cameraman focuses on your face).

There is another thread here where someone, compared you trying to take over this sub to CherryCrush running her own sub, that was spot on.

Well CherryCrush ACTUALLY *delivers* what her public at there to see, and that is why she is getting such a growing audience. Her content is not an endless, ongoing 15 year old tease fest. She might do hardcore, but she found her own way of doing of hardcore, and it's awesome. And you know I'm right because if you take a look at this subreddit, you'll realize even your most hardcore fans are starting to dislike your content, we can only go so far before we feel ripped off. What I can't wrap my head around, is why you got into porn, film porn videos, accept goddamn porn awards, film with notorious hardcore companies, but refuse to actually embrace that your fans want to see porn? Keep in mind, I'm not asking you to degrade yourself like most pornstars. Original content goes a long way and it **does not** requires you to take it in the ass or do what mainstream porn is doing.

So no, I'd not like to see you take over this sub-reddit. Why? So I can get the same 1 minute teases (that actually don't tease anything) you put up on your blog? There are already several links here to forums where we can download your content without commiting to subscribing and going months without updates.

I'm sorry but that's my take on it. Feel free to go on a rant on me and call me names or whatever.

I think we'd all love to discover some deeper meaning or hidden relationships behind all these ruins, monoliths, portals, Atlas Pass rooms, etc. It's why we're on this subreddit. 

It seems unbelievable that they'd have programmed all these things to spawn more or less randomly and have no relationship to anything else on the planet or to the planet itself.

Even if that's the stark reality, it doesn't mean we can't roleplay there is something more. And perhaps, in the infinity of this algorithm, there are worlds where the numbers came together in a manner even the game's creators could never have intended, creating some odd, emergent reality.

I have to admit that adding in the color to my work has certainly made it pop and attract lots of attention... but the extra steps and work required is significant.  There is no going back for me now (too much invested in my equipment and process) but in retrospect I think I would have a bit more success and higher profit vs the amount of labor involved had I focused entirely on etching only.  I really would need to add about 25% more to my prices to really profit appropriately for the extra work involved in the painting stage, but I feel like I am already near the upper edge of what people are willing to pay for painted glassware.  So you probably made the right choice, the color is a beautiful but expensive addition (in terms of the material, equipment, and extra time involved).

"dgrlvsf","""Unsupported assumptions""? No need to be rude, man. This is all speculation and the most likely answer is that we're *both* wrong. My assumptions are as supported as yours and vice versa.

There's a lot of splitting hairs, here. Pre or proto, idgaf really, the *point* is, whatever that thing was, it likely served as a jumping-off point to create future Warframes, so it's not that much of a stretch to think we can derive some hints as to a Warframe's true nature from whatever that thing was. You only call something ""proto-"" anything in hindsight, anyway. Likewise, ""techno-organic"" vs ""biomechanical"", practically the same thing. Yeah, metal-coated zombies--sounds like what I've been saying all along? Sounds *part organic*?

It's occam's razor, not anthropomorphization, that leads to me thinking that the red goop that leads to incapacitation if enough is lost (which the game *itself* calls ""*bleeding* out"" and ""dead"") is blood of some sort. Likewise, [this](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-1cRG22GCBBM/VmGK5LaP3HI/AAAAAAAAPnQ/MCCijPAEFA0/w958-h528-no/Warframe0332-20151204_063959%255B1%255D.jpg) looks more like a (possibly infested) fleshy wound than broken metal, and once again--while it could represent something else, until there is compelling evidence otherwise I'm going with the answer with the least assumptions.

But should that evidence appear, I'll gladly change my interpretation--I'm just not as invested as you, I guess, which is why I don't want to be *arguing* this at all lmao. All I really cling to is the idea that Warframes are, to some degree, sentient (but not necessarily sapient). If even that's disproved once and for all, I'll have to suck it up and accept that my characterizations of my frames are all an AU, but for the rest? I'm flexible. In this game's lore, you have to be, because 90% of our speculation is going to be wrong. They keep us guessing, and I like that. Even though it sorta sucks for fan stories. So I don't care which of us is right, really, I just feel like you're being very aggressive about this (which I guess is eliciting a defensive reaction I should probably analyze, but we're not here for self-reflection lol. This is the internet!).

Anyway, that brings me to your final point--honestly, ""the story angle"" is so subjective it can't be argued one way or another. Not only that, but it's also in how you phrase it, how it's written--you flower-up your idea while dressing down mine. I could just as easily do the same: ""Basically just robots made out of sci-fi metals"" is boring, ""biomechanical beasts trapped and tortured and mind controlled, gilded and beautiful but hiding a hideous secret"" just *sings*.

(Besides, people thought the Tenno being superpowered children was boring, as well, but that turned out to be true.)

Lastly,

&gt; ... that integrates itself with the body ...

This seems an important bit from that quote. It's clearly indicating it's just as likely that this ""living metal"" is integrated into an organic system as it is left as standalone. Or, at least, as clearly as anything from early conceptualization stages can indicate something about the final product.

In summary: The evidence, to me, indicates a high probability that Warframes have organic components, that are likely infested or related to infested. It could all change in one new quest, but the logical thing is to make as few assumptions as possible and base my theory on available evidence, accepting the possibility that it could change.

"dg1mc3i","I see a lot of people saying that complex analysis is useful and beautiful but not really giving specific examples. Here are a few that come to mind immediately:

* The complex numbers are interesting as an algebraic structure. `[;\mathbb{C};]` is an algebraically closed field (the fundamental theorem of algebra) and has all sorts of nice properties. You can think of `[;\mathbb{C};]` as the field extension `[;\mathbb{R}(i);]` or as the two-dimensional vector space over `[;\mathbb{R};]`. Continuing this idea, `[;\mathbb{C};]` also has a very useful geometric interpretation.

* Suppose `[;f: \mathbb{C}\to\mathbb{C};]` is differentiable in an open subset `[;U;]`. Then `[;f;]` is infinitely differentiable in `[;U;]` and is analytic, i.e. we can write it as its Taylor series in a neighborhood of each point `[;z \in U;]`. If we write `[;f(z) = u(x,y) + iv(x,y);]`as a function on `[;\mathbb{R}^2;]` then `[;f;]` also satisfies the Cauchy-Riemann equations in `[;U;]`: `[;\partial u/\partial x = \partial v/\partial y;]` and `[;\partial u/\partial y = -\partial v/\partial x;]`. We say that `[;f;]` is **holomorphic** in `[;U;]`.

* The exponential function and `[;\sin/\cos;]` make a lot more sense in `[;\mathbb{C};]`. This is where we get Euler's formula: if `[;x;]` is a real number then `[;e^{ix} = \cos(x) + i\sin(x);]`.

* Being complex-differentiable is actually a pretty strict condition. But the tradeoff is that we get lots of cool theorems about holomorphic functions that might defy your expectations if you're coming straight from real analysis. Liouville's theorem states that any bounded function which is holomorphic on all of `[;\mathbb{C};]` is constant. In turn, Picard's theorem states that if `[;f;]` is non-constant and holomorphic on all of `[;\mathbb{C};]` then the range of `[;f;]` is the entire complex plane minus at most a single point.

* Contour integration is important; we can use it to find integrals that would be too hard to calculate otherwise, such as `[;\int_0^\infty \sin(x^2)dx;]`. We have a lot of nice formulas that give us the values of integrals based on the poles and zeros of the functions we're integrating, which makes complex integration very useful. Integrating on a contour is a key step in many important proofs (the prime number theorem, Riemann's work on `[;\zeta(s);]`).

* Here's another cool thing about holomorphic functions: if `[;f;]` and `[;g;]` are holomorphic functions which agree on a subset containing one of its limit points, then `[;f = g;]`. This idea is crucial to analytic continuation.

* Recall that we define Riemann's zeta function as `[; \zeta(s) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{n^s};]` where `[;s = \sigma + it;]` is a complex variable. This series only converges for complex numbers with real part `[;\sigma &gt; 1;]`, but we can use analytic continuation to define `[;\zeta(s);]` for (almost) all complex numbers. This basic idea lets us learn a lot more about `[;\zeta(s);]` and is the motivation for things like L-functions, more general zeta functions, the Weil conjectures, etc. Basically all of modern number theory.",1491768277,"i see a lot of people saying that complex analysis is useful and beautiful but not really giving specific examples.","useful and beautiful","beautiful",NA,FALSE,"useful and beautiful","useful",NA,NA,0

The weather was sunny and beautiful, but we saw dark clouds in the distance, and they were moving incredibly fast. Suddenly, it started becoming windy, and just like that, we were caught in the middle of a derecho (strong thunderstorm). What made it worse was that when we got inside, we had to pack up and each of us would have to lay on one corner of the tent so the wind wouldn't blow it away. I began to freak out since the winds were strong enough to send a tree collapsing right on top of us. We rushed out of the tent and to the car, where my dad saw a tree begin to fall onto a different family. My dad yelled for them to watch out, and luckily they didn't get crushed. Eventually it stopped, and we found our tent stuck in the trees. We spent hours trying to get it out but we eventually just gave up. After it ended everybody else just planned on staying there for the night, but we decided to leave.

But yes, physiological outlier. Like Michael Maniaci, who attest to having an underdeveloped larynx that allows him to sing as a male soprano. 

So I agreed with you, that it's not a law that no male can sing in the soprano range as a female soprano would. In your comment I honestly thought you were talking about countertenors, because a lot of people call them sopranos and they're fairly common and people think normal pop singers like MJ are one. 

And I don't think it's outdated? If anything, the true male soprano was and is prized. I've seen a lot of people say it's a pity we no longer create them through castration because the results are so beautiful. Radu Marian is a rare natural one (whereas Maniaci had some health issue?) and his voice is truly unique and beautiful. But again, exceedingly rare. Most men are not even tenors. Their bass/baritones. So my comment is rooted in that I feel it's unfair men are expected to sing crazy high for their physical abilities, because they're seen as inadequate and boring if they stick to a healthy range.

##Why does this belong in /r/Games? (Aka. Why is this post here?)

The series itself takes standard RPG character / MMO role tropes and turns them on their head in the most comical manner possible. 

The video that is linked is for the minigame included on the Bluray of volume 1 for the second season of the show. It actually looks interesting.

##Summary of the show / light novel (Copied from MyAnimeList):
&gt; After dying a laughable and pathetic death on his way back from buying a game, high school student and recluse Kazuma Satou finds himself sitting before a beautiful but obnoxious goddess named Aqua. She provides the NEET with two options: continue on to heaven or reincarnate in every gamer's dream‚Äîa real fantasy world! Choosing to start a new life, Kazuma is quickly tasked with defeating a Demon King who is terrorizing villages. But before he goes, he can choose one item of any kind to aid him in his quest, and the future hero selects Aqua. But Kazuma has made a grave mistake‚ÄîAqua is completely useless!

&gt; Unfortunately, their troubles don't end here; it turns out that living in such a world is far different from how it plays out in a game. Instead of going on a thrilling adventure, the duo must first work to pay for their living expenses. Indeed, their misfortunes have only just begun!

##Basic character summaries/role:

* Kazuma (Main Character) - Guy sent to alternate world, hijinks ensue

* Aqua - Useless goddess

* Darkness - [](#s ""Masochistic"") Tank

* Megumin - [](#s ""Useless"") mage [](#s ""who only cares about casting Explosion"")

"dd7xicq","That's like saying of a painting or photograph ""if someone has to know the full back story behind a picture for it to have any significance, then it is not an iconic image."" 

_Plenty_ of iconic images are considered to be so not because of their inherent composition, or the color palette, but because of the moment they captured, and the backstory behind it. 

The pure aesthetic value of something is only one measurement of the value it has. Just as when you eat food, the flavor and texture are one value, and the nutrition is another value that it _also_ has. Something can taste bad but be good for you, or it can taste great and be bad for you - or both at once. 

Something can be ugly, but highly meaningful. It can be beautiful, but meaningless. It can be both. Clothing can also have practical value, and nearly everything can also have creative value. 

The fact of the matter is, when I see Michelle Obama, _I do see someone who dresses well on the aesthetic scale_ - that's not to say I love every outfit, but I'm highly picky. Although when she went to her first meeting in the White House with Laura Bush in 2008, she wore a red Maria Pinto dress that had sunburst pleats at the neckline; I have since bought several dresses with sunburst pleats, and find them highly flattering. But _I also understand the backstory of the fashion she's wearing_ - it's not something I can turn off. It's not something that the people she's communicating to with her clothes can turn off, either; and there's value in that. Even if a visiting head of state doesn't know the name of a designer whose dress she's wearing, they will understand the shared cultural aesthetic the dress speaks to. They will know that the First Lady has made an effort to make them feel welcome. _There is value in that_.

Just as I understand the backstory of history and art-history and thus paintings hold quite a bit of meaning to me beyond ""gosh, that's a pretty picture."" Prettiness has a value, but it's not the _only_ value of an image - or a dress. 

I think it's perfectly reasonable for people _in the fashion industry_ to understand the backstory and language of their own industry and to appreciate when someone with as much visibility and influence as the First Lady does as well. And if people like me also happen to find her personal aesthetic appealing - and no doubt many people find it even more appealing than I do; I loathe prints and cardigans - in an off-the-rack way, that's fine. But Michelle Obama is a fashion icon not because she's willing to fasten a belt over a cardigan, but because she understands that there's much more to fashion than that.

   ‚ÄúTonight,‚Äù I say, ‚ÄúTonight will be the night!‚Äù

Standing in my kitchen, I examine the recipe.  Shaking my head slowly, I try to picture how it will all come together.  Each ingredient and each step, planned perfectly.  I‚Äôve had so much practice, I know it should all come naturally.  The dish features all of my favourite flavours, and it‚Äôs one of those rare dishes that is actually fun to make.  I cook often, but I rarely look forward to it.



   *Ah, drat, there goes the pan.  Dropped again.  It‚Äôs so hard to cook without being able to see well.*



   ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs see‚Ä¶ the grill is on, I‚Äôve got the knives sharpened and prepped, and there‚Äôs a variety of wines in the fridge..‚Äù I muse as I pace the kitchen once again.  ‚ÄúAnd of course, I‚Äôve gone fishing for the most important ingredient.. Thank goodness the conditions were favourable‚Ä¶‚Äù  At this, I grin.  Truly, the conditions were almost always favourable.



   *Honestly, would it kill the landlord to put a decent light in here?  It‚Äôs always so dark.*



   Pulling the fish out of the fridge, I carefully slice and spice the meat.  It certainly wouldn‚Äôt do to ruin it now, not on tonight of all night.  Tonight is to be special!  There will be company coming, a rare enough occurrence, and I‚Äôm to showcase my personal best dish.  With thoughts of accolades and praise running through my mind, I absentmindedly prepare the accompanying dishes ‚Äì an interesting new take on a seaweed salad I thought of the other day, and a light soup.  Of course, this absentmindedness shouldn‚Äôt detract from the end result.  I know I‚Äôm repeating myself, but that is what one does when they frequently talk to themselves.  The practice!  That‚Äôs the thing.

   As the fish finishes baking, I pull back the kitchen blinds.  I smile as I look out ‚Äì I can‚Äôt truly see them, but I know that my home is in the middle of an abundance of wildlife.  Some days I wish I could really appreciate them, because I know they must be beautiful, but such is my lot in life.  I suppose that is one benefit to the dark.  

   With the fish done, I plate it and arrange it.  Realizing the time, I eagerly tidy up the table once more and sample a small bit of the meal.  I smile again as I realize that this time, I‚Äôve done it ‚Äì this is the best I‚Äôve ever made my grilled goblin shark!


‚Ä¶



   The fish sits, cold and uneaten on the table.  The soup is filmy.  The seaweed salad has gone limp.  I sit near the window, all traces of pride gone.  

   Today was meant to be the day, I think.  Today, company would finally come.  Of course, company is hard to find out here‚Ä¶down here.  The only ‚Äòcompany‚Äô that I can ever seem to find are the fish, the wet beasts that lurk outside my window.  They always seem to be out there, when I open it, as if they‚Äôre waiting for me to join them outside.  I stand and open it, covering my feet in water that seems black, snatching the closest body I touch. (""Hah"", I say. ""Another successful fishing trip!"") After putting the still-thrashing body in the fridge, I get out the mop and do my daily clean-up routine: clean the water off the floor, toss out any remaining teeth from the butchery of the fish, and set out the spices and knives for tomorrow.  

   ‚ÄúTomorrow.‚Äù I say firmly to my empty kitchen. ‚ÄúTomorrow will be the day.‚Äù

"dcqbjhq","You've named some of my favourite bands! It's fantastic to be witnessing the evolution of such bands. I think the reason they work so well (and why I, as someone who listens mainly to metal, enjoy them so much) is that they have their roots in metal and this will always be visible in their songwriting, but they are not wedded to the cliches of the genre, so they can adapt their metal chops in a way that serves the song best (as opposed to sticking to the cliches because fans expect it of them)

Re Ayreon, I actually found The Human Equation a bit difficult to get into. I'd recommend digging into 01101001, it's got a lot of variety and fantastic vocal work. Here is [Waking Dreams](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01KtEKYQCKI), starring Jonas and Anneke - a lot of great electronica and emotion in there. Ayreon's latest, The Theory of Everything, also has fantastic instrumentation and singing though the story isn't anywhere near as compelling as the previous releases.

In the words of the immortal Charlie Chaplin:

I should like to help everyone - if possible - Jew, Gentile - black man - white. We all want to help one another. Human beings are like that. We want to live by each other‚Äôs happiness - not by each other‚Äôs misery. We don‚Äôt want to hate and despise one another. In this world there is room for everyone. And the good earth is rich and can provide for everyone. The way of life can be free and beautiful, but we have lost the way.

Greed has poisoned men‚Äôs souls, has barricaded the world with hate, has goose-stepped us into misery and bloodshed. We have developed speed, but we have shut ourselves in. Machinery that gives abundance has left us in want. Our knowledge has made us cynical. Our cleverness, hard and unkind. We think too much and feel too little. More than machinery we need humanity. More than cleverness we need kindness and gentleness. Without these qualities, life will be violent and all will be lost‚Ä¶.

The aeroplane and the radio have brought us closer together. The very nature of these inventions cries out for the goodness in men - cries out for universal brotherhood - for the unity of us all. Even now my voice is reaching millions throughout the world - millions of despairing men, women, and little children - victims of a system that makes men torture and imprison innocent people.


To those who can hear me, I say - do not despair. The misery that is now upon us is but the passing of greed - the bitterness of men who fear the way of human progress. The hate of men will pass, and dictators die, and the power they took from the people will return to the people. And so long as men die, liberty will never perish. ‚Ä¶..

Soldiers! don‚Äôt give yourselves to brutes - men who despise you - enslave you - who regiment your lives - tell you what to do - what to think and what to feel! Who drill you - diet you - treat you like cattle, use you as cannon fodder. Don‚Äôt give yourselves to these unnatural men - machine men with machine minds and machine hearts! You are not machines! You are not cattle! You are men! You have the love of humanity in your hearts! You don‚Äôt hate! Only the unloved hate - the unloved and the unnatural! Soldiers! Don‚Äôt fight for slavery! Fight for liberty!

In the 17th Chapter of St Luke it is written: ‚Äúthe Kingdom of God is within man‚Äù - not one man nor a group of men, but in all men! In you! You, the people have the power - the power to create machines. The power to create happiness! You, the people, have the power to make this life free and beautiful, to make this life a wonderful adventure.

Then - in the name of democracy - let us use that power - let us all unite. Let us fight for a new world - a decent world that will give men a chance to work - that will give youth a future and old age a security. By the promise of these things, brutes have risen to power. But they lie! They do not fulfil that promise. They never will!

Dictators free themselves but they enslave the people! Now let us fight to fulfil that promise! Let us fight to free the world - to do away with national barriers - to do away with greed, with hate and intolerance.

"dchmakt","I apologize that this is a small novel. I have been thinking about how to best answer you since I saw your post this morning while waiting for duty section turnover. There are a lot of things to consider, and I think you should make this trip.....just not right now. 

Let me answer your questions first. Yes, you need a passport. The only way you can enter Japan without a passport is if you are on official military orders. This is only because Japan and the US have a SOFA agreement, not because our Navy is exempt from the rules.

Anytime a sailor travels out of the US or away from their OCONUS duty station they have to do the APACs paperwork and, depending on the country, get an Anti-Terrorism Force Protection cert from NKO, do the foreign country clearance guide from the .gov website (or depending on your command and/or destination get actual one-on-one training from your Force Protection Officer), and lastly, since it is Japan, do all the required training for all sailors--active, reserve, TAD, or on leave--who are in Japan. 

SO, this is going to sound really negative, and I don't mean for it to be. I really encourage international travel --especially without the Navy-- but I don't think you are ready for this trip. Just....really think about some of the stuff I'm going to bring up. I have lived in Japan for 8 years, done the Japan-America round trip at least 10 times. Also, I do a lot of international travel without the Navy, so I understand some of the planning and incidentals you'll need to factor into your budget for this trip.

1. You need to count for four days to travel to/from Japan alone. That brings your total leave time down to 10-11 days. Add two more for you to get to your next duty station, you're down to 9-10 days. 

2. The cost. If you are like typical a-schoolers, you probably don't have $5k sitting around, and you are too young and too early in your career to jump immediately into a significant amount of debt. Just because your credit card limit is high, does NOT mean you should max it out. I would talk to your command financial specialist to see if you have the means or can come up with a good savings plan to make this trip happen. Not only do plane tickets cost around $2-3k each, you're looking at $65-100 a night for a hotel....and another $50 a day for food for each of you, another $500 for train tickets, another $500 for two passports. Plus any souvenirs you want to buy. 

3. The size of Japan. Okinawa is nowhere near mainland. I describe Oki as ""America lite"" because there are like, 20 bases on that island alone. Everyone in Oki is either Japanese-American or they married an American or had a kid to American or went to school in America. Everyone in Oki speaks English and most places accept dollar bills instead of yen. You will be going to the Hawaii of Japan. It's nice, and beautiful, but not like mainland at all. 

4. Further notes on distance. Time and distance in Japan do not correlate because everything is in kilometers per hour, and the max speed you can go is 80 km, which is not even 50 mph. So taking a bus or taxi for local destinations will take longer than you originally planned. If you take the Shinkansan, there is a [special ticket for gaijin passport holders that must be bought prior to entry into Japan](http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2361.html) that will let you buy a week long pass for about $400. It that will let you move around freely in Japan....but you're still looking at added time because it is public transportation. If you stay on the Iwakuni, Yokosuka, Atsugi or Misawa bases, you're still looking at a 20-45 minute get-off-base-get-to-the-train-station on either end of your trip. PLUS, there's a curfew in effect in Japan for all military service members (even those on leave who don't belong to any command in Japan), so if you stay in Yokosuka and try to go to Tokyo you are looking at around 2 hours to get from the Navy Lodge to Shibuya or Roppongi. Look up where you want to go and then look at some of the train routes (I suggest downloading Japan Travel App; Yokosuka-Chou is the nearest station to Yokosuka Naval Base and Sagamino is the closest to Atsugi) and calculating how much time it's gonna cost you to see what you want--can you do everything you want in a week? 

5. A note on the Navy Lodge: they are usually full several months in advance, so if you're serious, call now and try to make a reservation. Know that it's about $65 a night for the lodge, and cheaper for the Navy Gateway Inns and Suits. If you stay out in town, staying in a western style hotel is going to cost you a lot more and it is going to be incredibly small. Like....some of the hotels I've stayed in I couldn't fit a queen size bed into the hotel room. If you stay in a Ryokan, well, that's a whole 'nother can of worms.

6. I don't know what you're hoping to see from your Anime dreams, but Japan is not like Anime. At all. My husband watches the occasional anime show --he's Asian, so he's not a weeaboo, or *otaku,* let's just clear that up right now--and his two cents is ""if you want to see the anime side of Japan you should book a tour."" [This is kind of what he's talking about](https://japandeluxetours.com/japan/group/anime-japan-tours). If you try to come to Japan on your own and see the anime things, you'll be sorely disappointed, or you'll be wasting a lot of time trying to figure out how to get to [the actual Totoro House](http://kotaku.com/in-japan-you-can-visit-the-totoro-house-for-real-1038774854) and back to base before curfew. If you stay in Oki, by the way, going to the Totoro house is going to require a $180, 2 hour plane ride. (one way)

I'd encourage you to do at least one patrol and save all your extra money and leave days for this Japanese adventure. Do a lot of research and planning so you don't spend a lot of money and walk away disappointed with your trip. Maybe make your Japan trip your personal reward for getting your dolphins or something. 

One last note. If you are dead set on making this happen, at least figure out about getting temporary international data/cell service added to your phone plan, or at the very least a pocket wifi when you're over here, so that you can have Google Translate and Google Maps at your fingertips. And notify your bank before you travel so they don't freeze your accounts and cards thinking they've been stolen.",1484548449,"it's nice, and beautiful, but not like mainland at all.","nice, and beautiful","beautiful",NA,TRUE,"nice , and beautiful","nice",NA,NA,0

My current hypothesis is that he wished to invoke the image and meaning of Dante's Inferno without actually having it be the key idea of the essay. Given that the observant nature of the narrator is undoubtedly indicating that the poem is a reflection of sorts, perhaps he's alluding to Dante's journey- his hardships, past suffering, and attempts to ""move onward"" in life. The ""miles to go,"" then, becomes an extension of Dante's journey; Frost acknowledges that he's got purgatory and paradise (2 canticas, 2 lines) to go through before he finally gets to rest (sleep), with the journey coming to a close. Perhaps he's reconciling himself with his own unique path through life; instead of being in the ""village"" with the rest of society, he's got his own lonely and painful route to take. He shows that it's one that takes him into territory that's most certainly calm and beautiful, but somehow melancholic at the same time. No doubt, the route he's taking is a cold and prolonged one.

This might relate to the death of his children and mental illness; he has been thinking about them for long enough that those closest to him (his horse) have grown concerned.

Better yet, this fits the interpretation about society. By taking such a lonely road, choosing nature over civilisation, he's making another choice as well. Given how close the relationship between poetry and nature is, it's almost like he is saying that he chooses his isolation both because of the ""different"" (more miserable) path his life as taken him on, *and* because he has chosen to value his poetry more. By showing the sorrow contained within the beauty of nature, he describes his own life- a perfect blend of the two.",1483593029,"he shows that it's one that takes him into territory that's most certainly calm and beautiful, but somehow melancholic at the same time.","calm and beautiful","beautiful",NA,FALSE,"certainly calm and beautiful","calm",NA,"certainly",0
"dbsvkl2","There was a famous British number theorist named G.H. Hardy, who worked in the early 20th century. He wrote a book called A Mathematician's Apology in which he explained that the best math is by definition the most useless math; and of all the math in the world, number theory -- Hardy's specialty -- was the most useless, and therefore the highest form of math. Math is done for its own sake, that was his point. 

The ironic thing is that in the past couple of decades, number theory has become the foundation of online encryption. Without number theory, there could be no secure e-commerce. 

I always imagine Hardy spinning in his grave because of this.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Mathematician's_Apology

But the deeper point is that when pure mathematicians do useless math, you never know when someday it will become useful. Number theory has been studied for over two thousand years and had no use whatsoever. It was just regarded as a supremely beautiful but useless branch of math.

Then within our own lifetimes, only in the past two or three decades, number theory has become a vital practical part of the world.

Another striking example is non-Euclidean geometry. It was first thought impossible. Then when non-Euclidean geometry was shown to be logically consistent in the 1840's, it was regarded as a useless mathematical curiosity.

Then in the early 1900's when Einstein developed his revolutionary theory of relativity, the mathematician Minkowski said Hey! Math has just the gadget to formalize this idea. Non-Euclidean geometry went from a useless curiosity to the geometry of the universe.

So the answer to your question is that mathematicians do pure math for its own sake. But you just never know when the most useless mathematical idea will become incredibly useful. It happens a lot.

I am a guy. 18. I will not tell you a single thing about me, unless of course you decide to ask. If you want to chat or play games or something, send me a pm.

 I say this because you, from what I can tell, are afraid. You have every reason to be afraid. But I believe your fear is mislabeled as a fear of men, but in actuality is a fear of bad people. And sadly enough many of these bad people you've met are not just passing by. And coincidently they are men.

I cannot truly relate to you, but i can at least state I had a fear of any talk of sex for a long time, finding it taboo. But as my family cared less and less, I did too (it took a long time, and still has a minor disturbance to me).

I'm glad to hear you weren't brought into any worse situations than what you've experienced. I get paranoid that something bad can happen very often to people I care about. (Maybe not paranoid, more like overly concerned and wanting people to be on their guard at all times. Let's just say I look both ways when crossing an empty one way street in broad daylight lol)

Anyway, you've done something that is very rare for people to do independently. You turned bad into good rather than more bad. And that empathy is a beautiful but risky thing to have. So keep going, but please be careful!

If you have no or few guy friends, or trust issues with people, or anything of the sort, I highly suggest you start talking to more people and expanding yourself (also, get out of your home asap! Work hard for it!). Baby steps of course, which is why I give you the option to pm me.

Lake County has a meth problem, there is no way you can truly say otherwise. 

The wine is totally decent and definitely up and coming, but the combined isolation with the problems I just listed above make it a less desirable place than it could be.

"daxpp5w","As an Australian hobby machinist I can say that you'll be spending a lot more than people in better geographical locations (from the perspective of a machinist) have to spend to get the same equipment. I gather, given that cost is apparently a concern, that you're not in the market for one of the beautiful but hellishly expensive European machines that pop up here second hand.  
  What state are you in?  
  Like others have said, the Optimum lathes are decent bang for the buck, although you'll need to spend some time getting used to the machine as supplied, and once you're confident and have a list of things you don't like about your particular machine, work out how to improve them.  
  Machinery Warehouse (or General Tools if you're in SA) are decent suppliers for the machinery. It helps a lot being able to lay hands on the machine before you buy it. If you read up on fettling a lathe before you buy, and get yourself a magnetic base and a dial gauge and test indicator and learn how to use them before you go to the warehouse, you'll be in a good position to check out the lathe's backlash, the trueness of its ways, and how much slop there is that needs adjusting out by trimming the gib screws.  
  After some time you might consider lapping the ways, or replacing the gibs and perhaps hand scraping the dovetails to take your Chinese machine into higher precision territory.  
 You can get better prices for the same tooling as you'd buy from Machinery Warehouse from ebay, and from some of the other suppliers mentioned in this forum. There are a surprising number of AU-based importers and retailers of pretty much the same kit as you'd buy from a bricks and mortar (or prefab/colourbond) business, and you'll save 50% or better on a lot of the items.  
  
There are also many good suppliers of inserts and tool steel that ship internationally, at very good prices if you're not in a hurry. Starting off with a small collection of indexable carbide tools will save you the learning curve inherent in hand grinding tool steel cutting bits, which can save you a lot of frustration when you're new to the hobby. Eventually as you build up your tool collection and consumables, you'll want to grind form tools and other usage specific pieces. But to start with carbide was certainly easier for me, till I developed a good understanding of how tools cut and how to grind for a specific application.

  As other people have said, you'll spend as much on tooling as you spend on the machine.  
&gt;How much should I be looking to spend on something that could do this type of work?  
  
Speaking from personal experience and based on the sizes you're talking, expect to spend at least $800 on the machine, and at least $500 on your initial tooling and equipment. (although you will never regret spending more money up front on a better machine. This hobby will happily eat any budget you'll reserve for it, but sometimes it'll pay for itself. A bunch of daleks bought me a 50mm face mill, a lot of bar stock, and a couple of packets of aluminium lathe and mill inserts) You'll build from there, and eventually your tooling and consumable collection will be several times the  cost of a Chinese manufactured machine. And if my own experience is guide, you're going to love it. I'm in AU too, and followed my childhood dream of fitting out a machine shop in 2005, and the local experience, isolated by thousands of kilometres of ocean from everyone else has been enlightening, demoralising, and very rewarding.

I went to a highschool in NY and got sold the same bs as everyone else and was pushed to go to college so they could say 99% of our graduates go to college or join the military (private school) but my father steered me in the right direction and I'm grateful for that. But people are going for degrees that aren't in demand and that's also a large problem. Universities shouldn't be pushing degrees in the liberal arts with the same vigor they push stem degrees. Also from a purely economic standpoint (I'm all for equality) but when women entered the workforce in the 70s and 80s it stagnated wage growth. Now it takes 2 parents working full time instead if one to maintain a household. Wages haven't increased since then when you take inflation into account, many refer to this as the two income trap. But to get back to my point everyone who has a mountain of debt and a useless degree made those decisions as an adult and didn't research their choices first.

"dahc633","One of my favorite theories goes something like this.

In the 2150s, a scientist by the name of Soong is released from prison on Earth after his augments begin running amok. In the course of events that follow, he introduces us to a region the Klingons call Klach D'kel Brakt, but which he has taken to calling the Briar Patch. Obviously a region he's familiar with.

Soong is eventually recaptured by Starfleet, following the tragic conclusion of the Augments Incident, after which he becomes disillusioned with genetic engineering in humans. He muses about shifting focus to cybernetics, granting that it may take a generation or two.

Some years later, Soong is out of Starfleet custody again-- either by his choice or theirs, it doesn't really matter. The Klingons still hold a bounty over his head, and he's none-too-liked in the nascent Federation either, due to its prohibitions on genetic engineering. So, as he searches for a clandestine location to work on his new cybernetics projects, he returns to the Briar Patch.

There, he stumbles on a ringed M-class planet, inhabited by a small colony of humanoids. He makes contact with them and learns that they are friendly and welcoming, though not generally accustomed to visitors. They call themselves the Ba'ku.

After settling on Ba'ku, Soong notices certain physiological changes in himself. In time, he realizes that the planet's rings give off a form of metaphasic radiation which, for reasons that elude him, have regenerative effects on biological tissues. Realizing that this planet offered him the opportunity to achieve his dream of cybernetic intelligence within *his* lifetime, instead of his as-of-yet non-existent children's, he makes arrangements to stay for the long haul. 

Years pass into decades. It is the better part of a century before Soong is able to begin development on the earliest forms of a positronic matrix. He collaborates with a few members of the Ba'ku community who, though they themselves decline to use modern technology, still have advanced expertise in a range of technological fields-- including artificial intelligence. Soong's work, however, is not without controversy; philosophical disagreements begin to develop among the Ba'ku. How can Soong's efforts to reach the pinnacle of technological achievement be reconciled with their efforts to renounce technology? 

In the slow-moving and deliberative community of the Ba'ku, it is decades before the disagreements grow into open discord, and decades more before true fault-lines appear in the community. Yet fracture, though distant, seems inevitable. 

Now well over a century after arriving on Ba'ku, Soong approaches the turning point. His designs for a positronic brain have now reached the point at which an artificial intelligence can be incepted. He invites the Ba'ku to witness the birth of a new artificial life.

The experience is brief but intense, beautiful but tragic. The artificial life is sentient for mere minutes before succumbing to a cascade failure. But the essence that lived for those few minutes was singular, without peer in the galaxy. It was a moment in time of a beauty that, to the eyes of some Ba'ku, was unmatched even in their natural surroundings.

The fault-lines within the Ba'ku community now erupt into open conflict, with several groups disagreeing across multiple dimensions of the issue. 

Some Ba'ku, led by a young man named Ro'tin, point to Soong's work as an example of the beauty which the Ba'ku deny themselves by shunning technology; they are opposed by more conservative elements, led by a man named Sojef, who are unconvinced that the artificial beauty bests the natural beauty they already have. 

Others are more concerned by the ethics of Soong experimenting with life and death-- Ro'tin's best friend, Gal'na, is deeply concerned about the suffering of the artificial minds. Such work cannot be done by one man-- it must be done by a community willing to bear responsibility. His group is countered by one led by Anij, who argues eloquently that life is never without risk, and that the chance to exist, even only shortly, is not one that should be denied to Dr. Soong's creations simply for the chance that they might suffer; she argues from a place of insatiable curiosity, even extending to the realm of metaphysics-- if one has the opportunity to explore godhood, they have an obligation to do so.

Soong, by now deeply indebted to the Ba'ku, is distraught to see their community being torn apart by his work. And so, one night, he packs up his lab into his ship and absconds from the planet without nary a word to the Ba'ku. He's done enough damage as is, he fears; any parting words would only flame the conflict.

However, even with the stressor of Soong's work gone, the fracturing of the Ba'ku continue. The inception of a positronic mind on their soil unearthed irreconcilable differences among the Ba'ku. Ro'tin and Gal'na both conclude that the Ba'ku's rejection of technology must end (albeit, for different reasons). They attempt a failed takeover of the community, and are banished, along with their followers. They leave, becoming a technophile, nomadic group called the Son'a; as their technology advances, their technophilia develops into dependence, which they alleviate in part through enslaving the Ellora and Tarlac.

In time, the reputed technical acumen of the Son'a will go so far as to ensure them a contract from the Dominion to produce ketracel white for the Jem'Hadar.

Meanwhile, Dr. Soong has been hard at work, developing the early Soong-type androids. Constantly rejuvenated and restored by the metaphasic radiation, he leaves Ba'ku physiologically younger than when he arrives, giving him decades to finish his work.

Eventually settling on Omicron Theta, Soong begins development on the positronic matrix that will eventually become the basis for both Lore and Data. Deep in the root code, he installs a fundamental imperative. If one of his sons should someday end up on the planet of the Ba'ku, and sees them under threat, he will take it upon himself to do anything and everything possible to protect them. It seems, Soong reasons, like the very least he could do to repay over a century of hospitality. 

Decades later, years after Soong's long-overdue death, Data turns up on Ba'ku-- as unaware of his ""archdefender"" root subroutine as he was of his once-dormant dream programs. There, he discovers evidence of a plot to kidnap the Ba'ku-- and Soong's subroutine kicks in. Data goes, for lack of a better word, berserk, and works to set right what has been done wrong to the Ba'ku. 

In the midst of his cybernetic berserker state, the Ba'ku are able to examine Data. Tournel, who had worked closest with Dr. Soong, recognizes the face of his old colleague in Data's visage, and is able to analyze Data's positronic net and even make some diagnostic conclusions, as he will later report to Captain Picard. But the wounds of the Son'a's departure still run deep, and the Ba'ku decline to try to troubleshoot Data any further. (Data's eventual friendship with Sojef's son, Artim, becomes a source of deep concern for the father, for obvious reasons.)

The rest is history. The man Captain Archer knew as Soong (whose first name never appears in canon) is the same man who created Data. Data's uniquely intense reaction to the injustice on Ba'ku is the result of his father's deep connection to the planet. The conflicts among and between the Ba'ku and the Son'a, seen during the Ba'ku Incident, reflect decades-old conflicts in which Soong was deeply intertwined. 

(As theories go, it is a touch ""small universe""-y, but I enjoy how it redeems the cheesy line from Soong about cybernetics taking a generation or two, and how it intensifies the drama of *Insurrection*. Plus it explains how the Ba'ku were able to diagnose Data, whose positronic net must be at least somewhat proprietary to Soong, why the two Soongs look identical, why Data went berserk this one particular time, and what the inciting conflict between the Ba'ku and the Son'a was.)",1480230038,"the experience is brief but intense, beautiful but tragic.","beautiful but tragic","beautiful","but",FALSE,"beautiful but tragic","tragic",NA,NA,1

"d8qxttw","I'm not advising you tell your mother like that. Let's be real: the reason you are struggling with which ring to take is because the two are disproportionately nice, otherwise you would have already asked for the smaller ring that belonged to your namesake grandmother. That's why the idea of moving stones from the fancier one to the other is appealing because it would make the other ring look nicer. Fact is, one ring IS nicer than the other, and that's why your mom doesn't know how to tell you and your sister to split it. And there's nothing wrong with understanding that valuation, and that someone would be getting the ring that both visually and economically is worth less, even if it has equal emotional weight. 

And that offset via inheritance is a real way that adult children deal ALL the time with inheritances in estate planning. What if your mom had a beautiful but too large family home that you and your sis grew up in, and wanted to rent out a smaller townhouse for herself, and asked you to decide now who was going to take it, you or your sister - what would you do then? How about if there was a third sister? There are still only two rings, so what would the third get if the coin toss isn't in her favor? That's it, she gets nothing and should be satisfied because fate? Come now. I get that this requires a hard conversation or even a hard series of conversations with your sister, and to your credit, most people are not very good at discussing what essentially amounts to estate planning, but a coin toss means you are ceding that decision to the vagaries of fate so that no one has to take responsibility for a tough call. And you have no guarantee that she will agree. That just should not be the precedent for discussing what is basically your inheritance with your adult sister, particularly because realistically,this will not be the last hard discussion you have to have with your sister about what to do with your parents' possessions. 

You have a lot of options before you and have you discussed any of them with your sister? Your mom has sweetly but I think mistakenly put that decision on just you exclusively when it should be both of you deciding. Has your sister been told about the two rings? What is her current thought on that? Do you even know if she wants the same larger ring? How does she feel about commissioning clones of each ring, with one sister taking one original each? You cannot guarantee that she or even you will not be upset if the coin toss doesn't go in her or your favor, even if you both agree to do something like a coin toss. That's why coming up with an actual plan with a semblance of equality, no matter the outcome, that you both agree to, is my advice. It's boring and not as quick, decisive or as fun as a coin toss, but no matter what, someone doesn't them receive less than the other. It's important that even a year after the decision is made that both sisters feel like it was fairly done.

No matter what, these are all just potential options that you have to discuss with your sister first, not us.

"d8qxox9","Fashion Month is done and I have so many thoughts. Firstly, thank god for this thread, I've only been lurking/posting for a month or two but this sub really seems to ignore HF. 

[Ellery](https://www.businessoffashion.com/fashion-week/2017ss/ellery/collection/look/1): I love everything about Ellery, the wise use of colours, the shapes the pieces create and the coolness it exudes. And of course, it wouldn't be Ellery without some amazing sleeves. 

[Paco Rabanne](https://www.businessoffashion.com/fashion-week/2017ss/paco-rabanne/collection/look/8): The detailing of this collection was a standout for me, and I loved the variety of both sporty and feminine pieces. 

[Gucci](https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/fashion-show-review/just-in-gucci-springsummer-2017): It's pretty much impossible to talk about fashion week and not mention Gucci now, Alessandro has done wonders for the house. There's so many things I love that I can't mention them all, but look 48 is my favourite. 

[Rodarte](https://www.businessoffashion.com/fashion-week/2017ss/rodarte/collection/look/1): I clearly have an obsession with the finer details, so it makes sense that Rodarte is a show I always look forward to. This entire collection is exciting and beautiful, there's not a single look I dislike. 

[Proenza Schouler](https://www.businessoffashion.com/fashion-week/2017ss/proenza-schouler/collection/look/1): Those earrings! They'd murder your ears, but damn they're awesome. Another collection that was faultless. I really love how wearable the pieces would be as separates. And look 28 is beautiful. 

[Monse](https://www.businessoffashion.com/fashion-week/2017ss/monse/collection/look/1): Just when I thought I couldn't be more obsessed with button up, oversized shirts, Monse drops this. 

[Dior](https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/fashion-show-review/just-in-christian-dior-springsummer-2017): One of the more controversial shows with the change in creative director and the similarity to Valentino (which obviously makes sense but probably offended people). I enjoyed the collection, but I still think it looked a lot less Dior. The sheer dresses and skirts were beautiful, but very reminiscent of Valentino. The 'we should all be feminists' top will probably become fairly iconic. But my biggest grievance is the chokers. I'm so done with chokers. I wish she'd stop allowing this trend to continue.

&gt; Poor Santa Claus. This live-action feature finds his sleigh stuck in the sand on a Florida beach only days before Christmas Eve. He psychically summons prepubescent aid from a nearby subdivision. In order to extricate Santa's sleigh, the local children bring many different animals (presumably the sheep was someone's housepet), but nothing works, and the kids are afraid they won't get any gifts this year. To boost their spirits, Santa tells them the story of Thumbellina, and the setting dissolves into a ""fantasy within a fantasy"". Thumbellina is a beautiful but very tiny girl, ""not much larger than a clothes pin"". She becomes lost in the forest during the winter and finds refuge in the underground home of Mrs. Mole. A neighbor mole, Mr. Digger, falls in love and wants to marry Thumbellina, but she's having none of it. When warm weather returns, she runs back into the forest and deserts the two kindly creatures who saved her life, crushing their spirits forever ... the end. As Santa is finishing his story and yes, that is its intended conclusion he and the children hear the wail of a siren. The ""Ice Cream Bunny"" has arrived in his antique fire engine to save the day\!

"d72isnw","You have not destroyed your body, whatever aesthetic or even physiological differences the testosterone had brought about. 

Your body only exists at all because it was the culmination of a million years of change, of adaptation, of struggle ‚Äì all of that ‚Äì all of that ‚Äì took place for the sole purpose of bringing you about. 

Now, some people add another link to the chain, keep the process going, and some people don't; it doesn't matter either way. I probably won't, although I might like to. 

It doesn't matter, because from the moment you were born the process had achieved a type of perfection ‚Äì in the sense of completion. A million years of struggle, adaptation and change is justified because it let you come into being. 

No-one has ever been in the world quite like you, and after you leave it, no-one ever will be again. 
You exist in a flash of miraculous transience; you will not be repeated. 

You are only here at all because your body ‚Äì the same body, whether you've had mastectomy, taken hormones or whether is had undergone changes as a result age, accident or disease ‚Äì came about as the culmination of a process that has lasted as long as life on this planet.  

There's no obligation to be happy about this, it's not a gift exactly. 

It's just how things stand. Life is beautiful, but full of suffering. Long, long before anyone us can even imagine, the processes that brought you ‚Äì you specifically ‚Äì into this world were put into motion, by a puddle of gross bacteria and some sexy algae or something... and now here you are.  

Your own father, in the the ultimate act of selfishness, tried to convince you that your body was just an ordinary object and not the engine which drives that living miracle of your existence. The one person who, for his part in bringing it about, ought to have appreciated that miracle more than any other. He's  apostate to the miracle of you... I'd set an Inquisition on him if I could.  

But for a very long and dark time in our history as a species, men have tried to convince themselves ‚Äì and convince us too ‚Äì that the female body is more animal than the male; that our existence, our genius, our consciousness, is of a different and usually inferior quality. 

But it isn't. Your body is the body of a thinking, feeling creature ‚Äì an improbable creature, a wonderful creature. It's yours, it's yours, it's yours. 

You did what you felt you needed to, in order to survive and keep on surviving. You hurt no-one willingly or knowingly; not even yourself. 

You have survived, which is how I come to be writing this to you. Maybe now that you're in a different stage of your life you're seeing that there might have been other paths available to you, but none of them were visible to you at the time. 

So how can you blame yourself for that? If you didn't know, what could you have done differently?

You took a path that you thought would lead you somewhere better. It was an act of optimism and courage. Don't feel shame for that; it was an act of resistance. 

I think the others are absolutely right when they say you should talk things over with a counselor, but I'm a hypocrite who never kept any appointments with mine when I was referred. 

The reason, by the way, that after months of lurking here I'm actually responding to someone is what you said about singing. I knew ultimately that I wouldn't transition because I was afraid of losing my singing voice. It sounds like a shallow reason; but after I'd had depression and decided to kill myself, a  return to singing was like return to self. I wonder that if I lost the means, would I also lose the will? Singing is joyful, even if you sound terrible. Evidence; just go to a Wales rugby match some time. Rather site specific advice, but whatever. Join voices together and it's magical, regardless of how you sound singing alone.   

And most importantly; whether you stay on T, or detransition or whatever; there is nothing monstrous about you. Monster has a double meaning, by the way, it comes from the a word meaning an omen or a sign. When you're strong enough ‚Äì  whatever decisions you make about how you're going to keep on surviving ‚Äì you will be a signpost to others and maybe they won't have to take their paths as blindly as you once had to for your own survival. 

I lurk here because I think a lot of the political/ intellectual arguments re. trans stuff are dangerous from a feminist perspective and that harm is done by promoting early/ paediatric transition and transition as a cure-all instead of more targeted/ relevant mental health support. Also, I've had some experience with male fetishists who I think are riding on the coattails of increased trans visibility. However, some people are happier having transitioned and you have to do what's necessary to live comfortably in this world. 

And I thank the primordial soup for making you, whoever the hell you are and whoever the hell you go on to be!

The thing with BC is you really have to evaluate what kind of lifestyle you want to lead. If making a lot of money/having a lot of options when it comes to the style of office you work in, then you basically have to work in the lower mainland or Victoria.

If you value work/life balance and immediate access to nature, then living in the lower mainland is not for you. If you are comfortable making $35-40k in a boring job, but having a lot of time to be out in nature/with family, then there are dozens of communities in BC that might fit your lifestyle. 

In smaller towns, some are gorgeous and beachfront, but are boring if you like having larger town amenities(Ladysmith, Qualicum Beach), while some have a really heavy artist/hippy population and little industry (Salt Spring Island +all islands, really, Nelson in the interior), while still others are beautiful and wild but have a blue-collar core (Duncan, Nanaimo, Campbell River, Prince Rupert up the coast).

2: i can draw no inspiration and can make no recreation of this idea because i dont have mods.

And then someone does it in pencil, AND makes it look better. Thats how i think unmodded and modded are like. bethesda has a much better art design than modders. (most of the time) and i find that unmodded settlements are congruent and flowing and 'fit'. And because they all use the same art design they feel like a complex pencil drawing.

But mods add whole new levels of art and different features and complexities that bethesda never intended and therefore never designed for and thus most likely dont properly suit the style. But if they are grand enough and complex enough and varied enough they can be beautiful.

"d68patl","Well, ok, here goes...

I am a non-mormon Canadian and I have lived here for over 20 years. I don't really notice the mormon thing anymore. When I first moved, a few of the people I worked with tried to steer me towards getting involved with the church but nothing aggressive. When it was obvious I wasn't interested, they backed off. What's interesting is that my religious coworkers treat me the same as anyone else but my religious neighbors almost completely ignore me. I get along better with my non-english speaking Hispanic neighbors than I do with the religious folk. Maybe its me though, I am a bit of an introvert. 

Basically, everyone is nice. No one treats me poorly. At worst, some avoid me. Which is not a bad thing.

It did take a while to get used to 'The Church' controlling everything in the state. Take the good with the bad I guess. 

As far as work goes, I would say there are a plenty of options especially in the summer when a lot of the university students leave. Not a lot of jobs that will pay very well though. My daughter works for a manufacturing company and she started at 12/hr which isn't horrible but not exactly enough money to travel the world or buy a new BMW.

The cost of living is low, but so is the average wage. So ya, I think almost any full-time job should be enough to at least get an inexpensive apartment. 

Other than the local service industries (retail, schools, etc) the main types of jobs are manufacturing and Utah State University. The two largest employers I believe are the university and Icon which manufactures exercise equipment. 

I work for the University and can say that they seem to always be hiring but not necessarily for the best jobs. USU is notorious for shit wages but the benefits can help make up for it. Great health coverage, half off tuition, lots of time off. I like it and have been working here since I moved here. 

As far as Logan itself goes, if you are an outdoors sort of person, its fantastic. World class biking, climbing, hiking, skiing as well as fishing and hunting too I guess.

It's also an incredibly safe little city. Lots of cops. Lots. Of. Cops.

One major down side is the air quality. Even though its a mountain area at over 4500 feet above seal level, we literally have some of the worst air quality in the country. Often during the winter we get an inversion when the clouds or pressure systems trap all the bad air in the valley. If you or your sister have breathing issues, this may not be the best place. 

So its a small, safe, friendly, outdoorsy city. Not very exciting with no night life. Beautiful but boring. ",1470634856,"beautiful but boring.","beautiful but boring","beautiful","but",FALSE,"beautiful but boring","boring",NA,NA,1

"d61bcrr","OK, so a lot of trans women are not going to get to the point where they could pass without makeup and with any hairstyle without getting FFS.  Some trans women who transition after puberty are luckier and can pull that off, but that is a YMMV sort of thing and if you really want to get there I would suggest really looking into FFS.  I myself hope to get to that point after FFS, but we'll see.  What I recommend you do for now is:
1. Get back on hormones as it can take some people more than two years to get the full effect.  Certainly being off of hormones won't help.
2. As someone else mentioned, once you're on hormones gain a bit of weight.  It's generally helpful to weigh close to the ideal weight for your height.  You need some fat to fill in the way your hormones would dictate but not so much that it'll accumulate on your belly.
3. If not already done, make sure to get rid of any facial hair.  It doesn't look like a problem on your pictures, but just covering my bases.
4. Find a hairstyle that works well for your face.  It doesn't seem to me like the hairstyle you have in the picture is such.  Go to a hairstylist and tell them what the issue is and hopefully they'll work with you to figure something out.  The hairstyle alone can make a big difference.
5. Figure out how to do your makeup in a way that works well for you.  This generally requires that you learn a good bit about makeup and try things out to see what works.  That said, a good application of makeup can definitely help, but it's usually not too easy to figure out how it'll work best for you.
6. You could try wearing glasses even if you don't need them.  You'd have to find some that look good on you, but the gendered nature of eyeglass design makes it such that it helps with passing.

I'd suggest you try these all out and see how it goes.  Most likely you won't look beautiful, but most likely there are somethings in there that'll increase the likelihood that people would see you as female.  You'll most likely be plain looking at best, but people would think plain or poor looking woman, and that'll probably be better than otherwise.  Some or all of these things will likely feel like crutches you'll have to rely on until you can get FFS, but you'll have found a way to make things work for the time being.",1470160990,"most likely you won't look beautiful, but most likely there are somethings in there that'll increase the likelihood that people would see you as female.","beautiful, but most","beautiful","but",TRUE,"beautiful , but most likely","likely",NA,"most",1

&gt; **Why you think you will be the sole SURVIVOR:** It‚Äôs not just my character traits that make me a winner. It‚Äôs literally in my blood to survive. My Japanese grandfather spent his childhood in an internment camp. My German grandmother‚Äôs family has strong, long-standing ties with the government and fled immediately before the war. My Native American grandfather was the son of a deaf mute who learned English as a second language on the reservation by age 9. I have a passion for competition and I am the product of generations of TRUE survivors- their strength and resilience are a natural part of who I am.""

@_________________________@

On the plus side, she did give us one funny moment, where she cheerily declared, ""**I'm terrible at camping but hopefully, my Native American heritage will help me. :)**""  She *randomly* tottered out that comment while Semhar was being a nutcase. Like, smack dab out of the blue during Semhar's Spoken Word. Oh, if we only saw this Elyse instead of the boring Elyse who didn't do much except be Jim Rice's random target for elimination. One of my least favourite trends in *Survivor* is the ""let's boot the tangentially relevant UTR woman because we want to keep the alpha male whom we *actually* dislike"". It happened with Hope and Allie, and when it happened to Elyse, I rolled my eyes because Jim clearly wanted to boot Ozzy but Weith didn't want to ""weaken the tribe"". Good riddance to that trope of ""target the beta woman"".

Additionally, Elyse is a great [singer] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2aKI_pGosg) whose Miss Washington Crown was revoked by Donald Trump for being **drunken** and **slovenly**. Gee, I wish we saw that drunken trainwreck on South Pacific, but instead, we got a relatively benign Amanda-Surrogate. In terms of fun, obscure references, Elyse is [Sue Li] (http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Sue_Li) from *Harry Potter*: interesting name, but man, not much else in the canon representation. Also, Elyse was very attractive. So beautiful... if only she was more like [a living incarnation of this video.] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojQtfU5W_mE) But then again, Savaii was basically the ""**Ozzy-Jim-Cochran**"" show, whereby everybody else got under-edited into oblivion.

And I don't understand why anything being a legitimate military target negates a ""war is bad"" theme. Don't you think Saving Private Ryan conveys a similar message with its brutal depiction of the Normandy Landings, in spite of the fact that no-one would dream of saying they were unjustified? War *is* bad, and it's bad because it causes suffering, even when it's justified. Showing that suffering therefore conveys that theme.

P.S. I watch pretty much every film as a plot-driven one. I can remember a few that are not plot-driven which I enjoyed (Fantasia springs to mind) but then there are films like Mulholland Drive which get rave reviews which I hated. I watch a film to be told a story, not to receive a philosophical point or watch some beautiful but meaningless abstractions.

- Wiping ourselves out and wait for the next species to start it all over again.
- Completely stop being humans i.e. remove our biological cages (hormones and such that influence us at a instinctive level.)

The photos linked above in this post about the NOMOS all have descriptions too.*}

I had heard and read a lot about NOMOS watches here and throughout the community, and had seen a few in person but none at all really grabbed me. They were beautiful but so plain in many ways. Not to say I require much adornment (although I admit that my grail watch, the [ALS Striking Time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaThqNG3DVI) is a little much), but the entire NOMOS design aesthetic did not say very much to me. Maybe Bauhausian design was not for me? 

I kept looking around and dropped by a small jeweler in NYC randomly, and saw a few pieces--same conclusion. Then I was in Chicago and dropped by a Tourneau, mostly out of curiosity, and started talking with a super-friendly and helpful agent there. (Sidenote: I was not wearing my Patek, not dressed well, and probably looked like a homeless guy wearing bright lime-green wayfarer sunglasses, but I was still treated great, even as I asked to handle $100+K pieces). We started talking about NOMOS and she shared some of my concerns, but she encouraged me to look at the Ahoi (white). For some reason, even in white, the Ahoi seemed special to me. The simple dial married to the glowing hands, elegantly spaced, unique lugs and thatched band really set it apart for me. The Tourneau agent strongly suggested I look at the Ahoi Atlantik, which in her opinion was the most beautiful of the NOMOS watches. 

A few weeks later, I was in Germany and made some time to visit a few jewelers--which is where I saw the Ahoi Atlantik Datum in person. Sure enough, it was beautiful: just the right balance (for me) between simplicity/Bauhausian design and unique, distinctive beauty. The contrast between the pistachio-colored hands and the black (although in some light, almost blue-ish) dial was really lovely, and the date integrated so well into the watch at the 6 pm marker. It had a nice weight to it, went well with a suit (which I am usually in unless I am just taking it easy, in which case I go for comfort), but also felt sporty enough to wear to the pool or the beach.

Sorry for the overlong discussion, but I thought some here would enjoy my thinking. I hope you enjoy the pictures and like the piece!",1465839733,"they were beautiful but so plain in many ways.","beautiful but so","beautiful","but",FALSE,"beautiful but so plain","plain",NA,"so",1

South of AVL:

- Secret Falls near Highlands is impressive and you can get into the lower-flow bits off to the side. Spray may be an issue.
- Schoolhouse, as mentioned, would be very nice for this. Best spots for shooting will be in the big pool out front, though.
- Sliding rock would be a no-brainer for a fun action shot, but expect huge crowds on weekends.
- Slick Rock Falls is a low-flow, showery type falls but could work for some compositions.
- Looking Glass Falls is very symmetrical and photogenic, but it's a bit more difficult to get in the falling water (you'll need to swim or hop over slick boulders). You'll get spray here too.
- Second Falls in Graveyard Fields is so tempting, and offers a number of spots to stand &amp; get into the water with little spray. But expect crowds. The rocky area at the trail bridge has some smaller chutes and falls and makes another great place to get in the water and experiment. (Well upstream of the falls below, of course).
- Skinny Dip Falls.  So many options there it's not even funny! Expect company.

North of AVL:

- Douglas Falls is a tall, skinny falls you can stand under with a log lying at the bottom that lends itself to posing on.
- Harper Creek Falls is a big falls into a couple of big pool - you might have to swim to get close to the falling water, though. Since it's more of a slide, spray shouldn't be much of an issue.
- Here's an off-the-beaten-path one. Bard Falls, on N. Harper Creek, has a nice swimming hole at the bottom and one of the most interesting shapes with potholes and pools. It's a bit of a hike to reach it, though. Medium flow with perhaps a very small amount of spray.
- Steels Creek Falls is similar to Bard in many respects, but it's more of a slide, so little to no spray.
- Widow's Creek Falls in Stone Mountain State Park is really really nice, but it's a very long drive from AVL. Low flow with numerous in-the-water composition options.
- Duggars Creek Falls near Linville is unique, falling into a lush crack in the rock with dramatic lighting when the sun is out. It's low-flow.
- N. Harper Creek Falls is beautiful, but tricky since the main waterfall ends in a deep crack/pool.
- Crabtree Falls is just beautiful and you can walk right up to the base in a shallow pool. It's crowded, but if you could only pick one to go to, this might be the one I'd recommend. Bit of a hike, though.
- Setrock Creek Falls is another one you can walk right up to and it's low-flow, so get right in.
- Near Crabtree and Setrock are Whiteoak Creek Falls and Roaring Fork Falls, both worth checking out if you decide to shoot in the Toe River area. Don't be tempted to climb Roaring Fork, though.
- Finally, Forrest Falls is only a short drive from Asheville, and offers a very short drop but with an interesting shape. It's low-flow but beautiful.

That's just to name a few that come to mind easily. All of these are available on my web site, [WNC Waterfalls](http://www.wncwaterfalls.info/), with maps, descriptions, directions, and photos. (Without people in them).

"d1fq1fd","Thanks for the response.

The paper topic is actually just to pick a holiday, research what food means in the context of that holiday (this is a class on food), and give my own take on it. I chose oshogatsu because I'm interested in it.

I think there's been a consistent misunderstanding of my question -- I must not have worded it very well. My intention isn't to try to find religious meaning and symbolism in Japan. Rather, I just want to understand how Japanese people today perceive the food, traditions, rituals, and symbols that *are* commonly present and observed. But I'm trying to look a little deeper than the fact that we just practice traditions. I'm thinking more about the underlying perceptions, which seem to be a lot different between different cultures, including my own and Japan's.

I think I have an idea of why I'm receiving so much negative response (one of which is because I'm talking to people on the internet). But in reality, I've come to this with total respect and curiosity for the culture, not ignorance.

I did do my research into Shinto -- I see how it is a part of the culture and not generally seen as ""religion"". It seems that the vast majority of people in Japan follow these ideals, this sense of ""living life in harmony with nature and the spirit world"" -- but also that the vast majority of those people don't question it. Such as trying to understand tangible facts behind what this ""nature and the spirit world"" is. Not that anyone can understand it *all*, but there are certainly specifics that could be questioned.

Again though, this isn't me thinking that Japanese people are ignorant or dumb or whatever connotation people might be putting in there. I think the notion you mention of how Japanese people generally see the world and live is valid and beautiful, but I think that there's also more to it. Because not everyone is the same.

I can't seem to explain my questions &amp; points in a way that is being understood here what I'm trying to get at. I think I've gotten as much constructive insight as I'm going to get, so I'll give it a rest.

Thanks again for the insight!",1459120475,"i think the notion you mention of how japanese people generally see the world and live is valid and beautiful, but i think that there's also more to it.","valid and beautiful","beautiful",NA,FALSE,"valid and beautiful","valid",NA,NA,0

"d18x9aq","If you want to catch some devils on TV, the new Omen series isn't bad. It's actually a 'true' successor to the movie in that they directly proceed from the movie and they're using actual footage and even stills from it (so Damien's dad is 'played' by Gregory Peck, etc). Damien's played by the guy who played Arthur in the Merlin series. 

Lucifer isn't terrible. It's even mildly subversive in a meta kind of way: the creator (Tom Kapinos of Californication fame) and star (Tom Ellis) of last year's Rush TV series are the series developer and star of Lucifer. The series protagonist, Rush, was a gifted doctor with daddy issues, a taste for beautiful but ultimately unattainable women and a penchant for making deals with shady members of the LA underworld. Lucifer clearly has daddy issues, has a taste for beautiful humans and also has dealings with shady people from LA...

In some ways, the Lucifer series is basically Rush Season 2 with a supernatural bent rather than a true adaptation of the Vertigo character/comic book series.

"d0odrbl","You're very, VERY welcome.. I know the road you are on, I have walked it - and the opposing army of self-consciousness is often, still, waiting around the corner. I know it well.

Being good looking / hot / whatever has the pitfall that we need to exert less effort to get attention. Sure, it works - but only for a little while - and not in any worthwhile way. On my appearance alone, I tend to attract beautiful but broken women. NOT my type. The beautiful, yes, but broken? NO.

If you can join your attractive exterior with an attractive, giving and loving heart - holy shit, does the world open up. You have self-value plus an ability to give, and that is extremely attractive.. it is also an active vs. a passive life, one where you pursue the people and things that matter to you, vs. waiting for them to appear before you, as if they are offerings...which you don't feel you truly deserve, anyway.

Bear in mind how a relatively average or attractive looking woman with an AMAZING heart is FAR more attractive than a shallow 10. Who cares if she's hot if she doesn't care about anyone else? Or see all those lovely women with homely looking dudes? The dude probably has an amazing, loving heart. And a good heart is more important to those women...that is the type of woman you want - and you have to be that type of man to find her.

For purposes of self-work, however, your appearance doesn't mean shit. It means nothing. Only your heart matters. So if you don't like your insides and you've been skating by with your outsides, it's time to turn yourself inside out...and believe it or not, your exterior will start to radiate in a different way if you do the inner work...you'll actually become more attractive on the outside because it matches your insides, which is where true beauty lies.

The heart is all that matters. Using it. Giving from it. Loving yourself with it. Loving others. It's all that matters. So many people learn this too late...

Writing and meditating are two excellent ways that will help..writing, to get your thoughts and feelings out, and meditating to enter a state where you can begin to be in touch with your inner self and make yourself available emotionally.

My guess is yours are cut off an awful lot, particularly your empathy with others and compassion for others - and, incidentally, for yourself. These are usually rooted in our childhoods, typically somewhere in the father-mother-sibling triad (some abandonment, typically), and in our need for external approval - because we do not have our own approval, which ties directly into self-worth (and lack thereof). We develop ""I am not good enough"" as our core belief and make sure to keep everyone away, lest they discover this fact.. we absolutely fear true intimacy.

There is an excellent book, King, Warrior, Magician, Lover - can easily find it on Amazon, that talks about psychological archetypes of adolescents and how most adult men never advance beyond boy psychology. It should be an excellent starting point for you, if you're interested in exploring...

Not gonna lie, long road ahead. But a rewarding one if you're willing to do the work.

And oh yeah, you already have your voice...but it's covered up, drowned, as you said.. it probably tries to come out from time to time already, but it's hard to recognize.. meditating and writing will help. Therapy would be the best option, however - if you can find a Jungian specialist, you'll have an excellent shot.

Last things for tonight - have you ever had any interest in the arts? Ever done any volunteer work? Two other excellent avenues...

Best of luck.",1457169584,"on my appearance alone, i tend to attract beautiful but broken women.","beautiful but broken","beautiful","but",FALSE,"beautiful but broken","broken",NA,NA,1
"d0odjzm","Although may be quite different it could relate. I had a very good friend last year and we both had a love for acid and weed, dropping it every other weekend and when one of us had a free house.

Tried to rip my house apart but lucky I wasn't feeling like tripping that day so was high and could handle the situation.
As I said kinda went off on a tangent but sometimes people who take acid can hold some super deep thoughts even after the trip and kinda believe it's real.
Try to talk to him before sending him to anyone, ask why he thinks the things he does. Don't make it personal but prove to him with logic that he is just imagining these things, would also say don't let him do acid again.
Acid can show you wonderful amazing things but it can be so powerful that idea and views that were perceived in acid can be branded into the subconscious so when you wake up from the trip only the negatives stay with you, not the positives.

"d0ht14f","I like it.  Some basic things that could spice it up would be.  


-Some sort of gravity affected particle splashes on bounces nothing big just something. (personally prefer over the screen shake.

-More advance levels could include guys pacing.

-It never hurts to have moving obstacles either.

-If you plan on monetizing it you're going to need better assets imo.  That is up for debate though.  Nothing crazy beautiful but idk how much people like the donkey kong steel beams.

-When the guys get hit have them not fly through the ground.

-Another personal preference but the shots left ui doesn't seem like the type of thing to be centered.  


I like the concept though and if you work hard make a lot of dynamic levels and such, I'm sure it could be a capable mobile hit.

"czx79gu","Wait for the new Q60 coupe. The Q50 sedan coming from a G37S was crap to honest. The Q50 felt soft, steering disconnected, brakes by wire which felt like crap, throttle couldn't feel anything. The car is beautiful but overall driving experience from someone that actually likes to drive is total shit IMO.

My main complaint is that of the touch screen infotainment system. God its terrible. On the G it may not be great but at least its a button or two away from what you want. With the new Infiniti system its all touched based and I HATED it. Maybe I could get used to it but it didn't seem anywhere as great as the Tesla touch system (I know its a more expensive car but I think it should still be compared).

"czx65xy","Weekend time!  Woo... 

My sister's engagement cake went really well and I did two more cakes this week, for co-workers who retired/moved stores (some of you have seen those!).  Right now I'm making macarons for someone's valentine's day present for his wife (awww).  

I've started listening to Jay Kristoff's Stormdancer series and so far it's simply lovely.  His prose skills are beautiful and delicate!  As much as I love the prose in Kingkiller Chronicles, reading it gives me the distinct impression that it's proud and a little smug about how good it is.  The prose in Stormdancer simply IS... it's there and it's beautiful but it's not showing off.  (Not that I dislike Kingkiller Chronicles, but the difference between the two was really distinct to me and I'm trying to clumsily put it into words!).  It did take me a little while to really get into the story because the first bit is quite info dump-y, but once I did, it got really cool!   

I went to a book lauch on Wednesday night, for My Sister Rosa by Justine Larbalestier and Summer Skin by Kirsty Eagar.  They were both very funny and nice and answered a lot of questions (I asked Justine if she had always had an interest in neurological disorders - her book is about a 10 year old psychopath - or if she had become interested by researching for this, and she said it grew out of an interest in The Bad Seed).  I bought a copy of My Sister Rosa and am going to read it once I'm done with Jay's books.  The other book, Summer Skin, wasn't really something I enjoy reading about (I'm mostly into SF/F but I have a big interest in psychological/neurological things because of my own various issues).  Speaking of Jay, he and Amie were both there supporting their friends, so I managed to speak to him afterwards and tell him how much I loved Illuminae.  Then we started nerding out bigtime about playing Wow and gaming in general.  It's funny because I was suuuuper shy about saying hello but as soon as Wow got mentioned, all the shyness vanished.  

Apart from that, it's been a weird week.  I ended up calling in sick to work for the last two days of my week because I've got really bad acid reflux and then a second problem popped up (keeping that one quiet) and together it was just too much.  I was so exhausted that I fell into bed and slept for 14 hours.  I'm sure that working for 8 hours, coming home and working on cakes didn't help me but.... gah.  It sucked.

"czqan4c","I got a sample of this and found the SPF too much, it is was beautiful but white. I tried the color Cuzco and wear Syracuse/Tahoe in some of their other lines. I loved the natural finish. 

Update 10 Feb: I went back and got a sample of the next darker shade which I had a feeling would be way too dark. Cuzco looked amazingly natural as I applied it but dried white af. Annapurna (the next shade darker) was way darker. It could possibly match me in the summer. I've previously used their tinted moisturizer in Annapurna as well which was way dark even when I was tan. 

As for the finish and wear, I loved it. I set with Ben Nye powder and also used powders for highlighting and contouring. I liked the natural finish and it lasted well through the day. It's medium coverage, I applied it with my fingers since that's how Francois Nars recommends to apply his foundations. 

I liked it but will continue to use other formulas since my colour does not quite match this line. I prefer fuller coverage since I colour correct my face. I actually use the Nars Radiant creamy concealer as foundation on days off and love that well enough for my ""natural"" makeup days.

"czjkq8w","I have to file as a US citizen. It wouldn't matter if I lived overseas 365 days a year, unless I give up my citizenship, which i don't want to do, I have to file taxes. 

I auto bill pay my rent for my place in Virginia. I am in a small mountain city that I like a lot. After spending weeks in a hotel, the last place I want to go is another hotel for when I am in town. I never thought I would stay there because I only had to do six months of training and then I could move anywhere. I just feel in love with the little city. 

When I travel, my employer is on the hook for my housing, whether its a hotel or an apartment overseas or in the states. 

I found Australia to be beautiful but very expensive. I hated working in the UAE. That entire region is built on human exploitation. They got more money than common sense. Keep in mind however, my experience was working outdoors in construction. So I witnessed all the shit that they typically do not allow many Westerners to see. I've enjoyed my time here in Japan this last week or so, but I could not live here full time. I have only interacted with a few other people from overseas and they are mostly drunk Russians. Local wise, I've been hanging out at this dude's bar because its freaking awesome. He is a huge country/western fan and his placed is decked to the ceiling in that crap. He also does amazing impressions of various country music singers. I don't even like Country Western music but the dude is just an awesome eccentric person. We watched the Under 20 World Cup final and Japan came back from a 2-0 deficit to win it. Its the cool weird people you meet in my line of work that makes it rewarding. But for the most part, locals don't seem comfortable being around me. That gets old after a while. 

I don't actually like to travel. I find flying in the states to be terrible. I'm terrified of heights so why I work on these [things](http://www.marinelink.com/images/maritime/CraneArrivalKhalifa-23392.jpg) I will never know. Those are the ship to shore cranes I commissioned in the UAE. I like my job because its very hands on. I am rarely in an office setting for longer than two weeks at a time, which tends to be very rare for engineers. I often times have to configure multiple different types of systems that on paper...should work...but rarely do. So its sort of like slamming your head against a wall repeatedly until you get success. But when you do, its an amazing feeling. There is nothing like seeing a successful first run of a steel mill or a port facility, especially when you have spent months looking at it in parts. 

My job has a lot of burnout. I was initially hired with 8 other new college grads three years ago. I am one of two left. I actually ended up in a hospital towards the end of last year because I had an emotional breakdown in front of a group of customers. I was giving training on some equipment they were ordering and I got asked what the fuse ratings were for the incoming AC. I know that like the back of my hand, but I had been awake for about 5 days. I was struggling with severe anxiety disorder and did not even realize it. I couldn't remember and when I looked down at the drawings, I couldn't make them out and started sobbing. 

My boss was walking past, saw this happening, grabbed me, and drove me to a hospital. I didn't get fired because this sort of thing happens from time to time in this industry. We handle multi-million and even billion dollar projects. And we deal with some very dangerous systems. So it becomes very hard to break away from focusing on every minor detail at the detriment to your own health. 

I spent two days in the hospital. Got released and I was too terrified to leave my apartment for a week. A coworker had to bring me food. Through therapy, I am much better than i have been in years. Like I said, I didn't even recognize how messed up I had become. I don't mind talking about this because I think its important to encourage people to discuss their problems when it comes to mental health. My only regret about the whole situation is that I didn't go to therapy years sooner. 

Despite all that, I love my job. Seeing water floating on the top of a white hot slab of steel or a 50 ton aluminum ingot turned into miles of tin foil is a blast. There is no better feeling than showing up to a site that is losing money by the second due to an unplanned shutdown and you know you will fix it in an hour. I've had customers go from screaming at me to wanting to kiss me in seconds. I'm weird. I know most people would hate my job.

"czd4drx","I'll edit in a source later, but I just wanted to say the above poster is slightly inaccurate. The writer said that he always envisioned the ending being Hiccup looking into the distance to a sky with no dragons. It's also supposed to end the same as the book series, which hasn't ended yet, but the first book starts with the words ""When I was your age there were dragons""

So no, the dragons aren't *necessarily* going to all be dead, just gone for one reason or another.

Edit: [Source](http://www.slashfilm.com/dean-deblois-how-to-train-your-dragon-3-and-4/)

Excerpt from article:

""When I was approached about a sequel, I said will you consider it to be the middle act of a three act trilogy? Therefore we‚Äôre not just inventing a random other adventure that you cast the same 5 or 6 characters into and graft on a problem that feels artificial. So by meeting Hiccup at this later stage of his life he‚Äôs now dealing with an organic and universal problem that many of us go through at that stage. But it is the middle chapter heading toward the culmination of Hiccup‚Äôs final coming of age. And the intention is to be very conscious of where we came from in the first movie and where we‚Äôre heading in the third. So I‚Äôve been working on a running outline for sometime and I know we‚Äôre going to get to the point where Cressida Cowell books start which is Hiccup, as an adult, looking back on his life and saying ‚ÄúThere were dragons when I was a boy.‚Äù There‚Äôs something really powerful and emotional about that that hits you in the gut. And I think it could be bittersweet and beautiful. But how they disappear? What happened and what leads them to that point? That‚Äôs the stuff of the third movie. We‚Äôre always very conscious to make sure the threads we‚Äôre pulling forward are from the first film and paying off in the second are also embedding storylines for the third.""",1453848006,"and i think it could be bittersweet and beautiful.","bittersweet and beautiful","beautiful",NA,FALSE,"bittersweet and beautiful","bittersweet",NA,NA,0

they have some other pixiedust polishes with bigger hex glitter... haven't tried any of those, but the pictures look a little too much... unless done as a gradient (glitter polish only on top or bottom)

I'm actually wearing dahlia now (black pixiedust with silver microglitter).... it was streaky to apply (not as easy as godiva* or stevie*)... but opaque in 2 coats.  I plan to top it up after 2 days with another coat to prevent chipping since it has no topcoat to preserve sand texture.

I've tried 3 zoya cremes including the gorgeous teal/navy color ""rocky"" but they have all been super runny, streaky and a pain to apply.  I threw them out because I'm not enough of an expert to fight with application issues.

but I'm sill a big fan of the pixiedust line....

edit:  *godiva is a beautiful champagne color.... takes 3 to 4 coats, but a breeze to apply.  *stevie is a lavender... 1 coat is delicate and 2 coats for opaque.  second coat makes the color a much darker medium purple... I want to try 1 coat of stevie over a white and see how that looks.  by itself, 1 coat is beautiful, but too uneven.  stevie is also a breeze to apply.... a great go-to mani when rushed because sand texture is forgiving about brush strokes.

[The Missing Exploding Girl](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B019YUI0US), $2.99, Book Two in the Superhero Detective Series

Not all Metahumans--people with superpowers--think they are the equals of normal humans. Some Metas think because they can bend steel girders with their bare hands or shoot lasers from their eyes, they are better than normal people. Those are the types of Metas who want to control the world. Not me. If I can control my beautiful but bloodthirsty friend Shadow, I‚Äôm content with that.

When I was hired to find Clara Barton, a teenaged Metahuman who can explode at will, little did I realize Shadow and I would have to go head to head against a group of Metas who sought world domination. I had to try to stop them.

Those world conquering types give the rest of us Metas a bad name.

Those two statements are incompatible to me. Part of love is respect, and if you have respect for her, you don't think of her as beneath you.

"cxqjkaz","an absolutely HUGE room, like clearly several thousand feet on each end... seems to be directly cut into the land around it. In the center is a raised structure, a sort of ruined open air rectangular roman temple in the middle of this enormous space. 

Inside the temple are four statues, one at each corner. When a player touches a statue he/she loses consciousnesses and the statue speaks through them. When the statue is done the player will stop touching it and awaken. If a player is forcibly removed from contact with the statue they will also awaken.

**Common to statues:**

* All statues hate the other statues but REALLY REALLY hate one other specific statue.

* All statues claim to be living wizards cursed into their statue state when trying to cast the spell on the other three.

* All statues claim that the spell can be broken by destroying the other three statues.

* All statues claim to know where the treasure within the dungeon is, but all four claim the treasure is something different and the other three are lying.

* All statues seem pretty damn untrustworthy by any form of inspection.

**Uncommon to Statues:**

**Statue 1**

* appears to be a human woman

* Appears to be young royalty, very beautiful and very very vain, but also extremely knowledgeable about history and arcana.

* claims that if she's freed not only will she help the party clear the dungeon that she'll pay them handsomely if they'll escort her home and will pay them half that even if they can not.

* Despises the Elven Man(statue 3) the most. He had insulted her appearance and magical skill repeatedly. If confronted he will suggest she used her physical appeal to steal arcane secrets and is not to be trusted.

**Statue 2**

* Appears to be a Dwarven Man

* Appears to be a young but physically scarred face to toes former merc, very humble and polite to the party, but very distasteful when discussing the other statues

* Claims he will act as minion to the party until he can afford to give any sum of money they desire or will hunt down any person or object and return it to them to earn his freedom. Informs party he has little to him but his name, word, and wits, but all three are good and he will do whatever he can to make it the right decision if the party frees him.

* Despises the Halfling Woman(statue 4) the most. He insists that he was deeply in love with her and she misled him in order to use him as a tool to increase her power via magical artifacts. If confronted she swears that he was deluded and stalked her, constantly offering ""gifts"" he had stolen.


**Statue 3**

* Appears to be a Elven Man

* Appears to be a stern and ancient business mogul. Seems mature and professional. Deals with the party as if negotiating a business deal, speaks of the other statues as if they were ill mannered children.

* Claims he can give the party magical items of incredible power. He insists that he creates magical items as a profession and is quite skilled. He will craft an item for each player to their exact specifications, but of course, the party will need to gather the components for him.

* Hates the dwarven man (statue 2) the most. Claims the Dwarf stole several of his most impressive items. If confronted the Dwarf will warn you that he once used an ""indestructible shield"" created by the Elf and that it lived up to its name because it would allow anything that would make contact to pass directly through to the person it should protect, leaving the shield in pristine condition.

**Statue 4**

* Appears to be a Halfling Woman

* Appears to be a young and beautiful but strong adventurer. Is clearly very experienced in adventuring and magic alike. Shares knowledge of places the players have been before to show connection to them. Seems terse and annoyed with the party's ignorance of the situation, but genuinely afraid of the other statues and what they can do.

* Claims that she knows this dungeon like the back of her hand and can help the party clear it without being surprised by any traps or monsters. She also claims she has several connections in the area and if the party ever needs her help, for the rest of her life she and her many allies will be at the ready to assist.

* Hates the Human Woman (Statue 1) the most. She claims the Human Woman is actually a witch who steals the beauty and youth from other women. She is seeking to kill the Human Woman because she took the lives of her Mother and younger Sister to extend her life and appearance. If confronted, Human Woman will deny this, and note that while the Halfling Woman claims to be an adventurer with lots of friends, it's odd that she's always traveling alone and knows things about places that she only knows through stories her grandfather shared.

If the party finds another way to free the statues from their cursed state then the statues will immediately all try to kill each other in a manner that's least dangerous to their rescuers.

As a civil servant, however, he was ineligible for such a position. His resignation from the Post Office removed this disability, and he almost immediately began seeking a seat for which he might run. In 1868, he agreed to stand as a Liberal candidate in the borough of Beverley, in the East Riding of Yorkshire. Party leaders apparently took advantage of Trollope s eagerness to run and willingness to spend money on a campaign. Beverley had a long history of vote-buying and of intimidation by employers and others.

Anthony Trollope was the fourth son of Thomas Anthony and Frances (Milton) Trollope. During his youth, he was shuttled among several public schools, where the ill-clad and awkward boy was often the subject of taunts and jeers from well-off schoolmates. When his father s law practice began to fail, his mother s American mercantile venture soured, and an expected inheritance was cut off, the Trollopes moved to Belgium. It was here that Mrs.

I literally asked for a pony,  and they bought me a horse. A pregnant mare who was a bitch from hell and way taller than I was.  I think she was about 17 hands.

(Leafs?leaves? I'm too lazy to google.) 

Sold that bitch and never looked back. 


*EDIT FOR THE REDDITS*

Most of you are assuming I was somehow a spoiled rich kid. Not the case.  My parents were incredibly poor and incredibly selfish.  As an adult I can look back and realize the horse wasn't for me.  It was to fulfill their ideals of a country life.  They were the kind of people who would buy an Xbox for Christmas and pawn it by new years.  Buying that horse was selfish of them.  They could barely feed us,  let alone a pregnant mare.  

I also asked for a computer that year.  That would've been useful at least.

"cx0zvqm","‚ÄúBut, but I thought you loved me?‚Äù

Her eyes were trying to hold back her sadness, but she was unable to and a fat tear streamed down her face. It was dark in the cave they were hiding out in, but the firelight illumined the path the salty water took down her cheek. She brushed the tear and turned away from Adam.

‚ÄúCharlotte, I DO love you. I love you more than the world itself. Where would I be without you? Please don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm ungrateful for the things that you‚Äôve done for me‚Äù

And he was grateful. He truly was. Most virgins didn‚Äôt make it past the age of 28. They were hunted and executed without mercy by those who could wield the power. Without Charlotte‚Äôs help, Adam would never have been able to escape the city.

‚ÄúOh, you love me, but not enough to show me. I see how things are‚Äù, Charlottte‚Äôs voice was filled with contempt. And rightfully so thought Adam. This women had risked her life for their love, left everything she had and everyone she knew. And now here he was, spitting on her sacrifice.

‚ÄúCharlotte, my birthday is in 2 days; if we could just wait until then‚Ä¶‚Äù

But Charlotte cut him off, ‚ÄúSo you can get your precious powers and then LEAVE ME! Don‚Äôt lie to me Adam, I‚Äôve seen the way you look at other women. Once you have the power and no longer need me you‚Äôll just cast me off to the side. I can‚Äôt believe I was so stupid. I should have never let myself be this vulnerable‚Äù. Charlotte was shaking her head and sobbing.

‚ÄúNo, I don‚Äôt even really care about the powers. I just‚Ä¶‚Äù

But Charlotte shot a glare at him and once gain interrupted, ‚ÄúAdam, I don‚Äôt care about the powers either. I just want to live a happy and simple life. I want to wake up next to you and fall asleep next to you. I want to laugh and grow old with you. I‚Äôm not saying what we have will be perfect. But I think it can be perfect for us.‚Äù She turned away again and the firelight let off a soft glow against the profile of her face. Her big and beautiful wet eyes were glistening. Her chest quivering in obvious pain beneath her simple white dress.

Adam was at a loss for words. Since his mid 20s, he had made the decision to abstain until he had the gift bestowed upon him. Charlotte was the only woman he had ever met who made him question his choice. She was beautiful, but more than that she understood Adam. When he was with her, he felt.. he felt at home. He knew he wouldn‚Äôt leave her once he got his powers, but Adam was also starting to see her point. He sat in cold silence for a while. The minutes seemed to stretch on for hours. Charlotte remained quiet, save the occasional sobs that escaped from her.

Adam firmly came to a decision. He knew what he wanted in his life and he knew what was truly important. He stood up and walked around the fire pit to Charlotte‚Äôs side. 

‚ÄúI love you Charlotte, and I will do anything to prove my love to you‚Äù. 

Adam grabbed her face and kissed her deeply. Charlotte broke away and looked up at him. The edges of her mouth slowly turned up. She smiled at him, and once again Adam was home. They embraced each other, made gentle love and fell asleep in each other‚Äôs arms.

***

The next day Adam awoke with a start. He was cold and saw that the fire had reduced to smoldering coals during the night. I must get some more firewood he thought as he sat up.

He jumped. There was a man sitting in the cave. On a golden throne. Adam had no idea how that could have gotten there, and he had no idea how this man had found him; but he instantly recognized him.

Baltazar was sitting in a forest green silk robe. His long blonde hair cascaded behind his back. A glow of warmth surrounded him despite the chill that the cave gave off. This man radiated authority and a stern, yet smug smile was etched on his face as he stared at Adam. A white raven sat perched on Baltazar‚Äôs shoulder also stole a glance at Adam and gave a short caw.

But the Baltazar wasn‚Äôt alone. Behind him was another person. She was robed in a tight black dress which showed off her bodice. A wicked sneer grew upon her face as Adam awoke and saw her. She had an arm wrapped over Baltazar‚Äôs shoulder and her hand was lying on his chest, caressing it. Charlotte‚Äôs beauty was amplified as she stood next to the great Wizard and a sinking feeling began to rise in Adam‚Äôs stomach.

Baltazar spoke, his deep voice echoing throughout the cave, ‚ÄúGood Morning Adam‚Äù

There isn't a lot going on in an FPS, in a simulation game the processor is constantly being stressed with the complex interactions of everything in game.

Take a look at dwarf fortress.  People look at its graphics, or lack thereof, and roll their eyes.  Play that shit for a few hours and once your fort gets big and that thing will rape your processor it doesn't matter how powerful your processor is.  

The GPU isn't always the only contributing factor.

"cwusp9o","the main issue with fallout 4 is that it uses the same engine as skyrim. so its really really hard to make the game feel ""next gen"" when its uses old(er)tech. so there really isn't much that bethesda can do aside from using a new engine, which would mean they would have to start from the ground up.

and honestly thats fine with me. other devs have no problem writing their own engines or using existing ones. for example dragon age inquisition was created from the ground up using frostbite 3. another one would be the indie studio hello games that had to make their own custom engine to create the vast universe in No mans sky.

so why doesn't bethesda bother making a new engine? because A.) it would actually cost them alot of cash to create a new one or outsource  B.) they would have to retrain their staff  and C). it would take alot more time and D.) a new engine might not be as modable as the creation engine, which is good and bad in many aspects.

&gt; In terms of Bethesda, their immersive worlds, beautiful and open environments

what are you smoking? this game looks nowhere near as good as other open world games. thats why its a con in every single review that you see lol. 

&gt;I mean Witcher is beautiful but as far as I know every object in that game isn't individual rendered with its own physics and an ability to interact with it

why is this considered a good thing? why do people praise the creation engine and the fact that it remembers useless things such where a spoon is or how it leaves doors open or the fact that you can put 100 cups in the corner of a cave and it will never go away. is this really a good thing?

do i really need to be able to have the ability to be able to grab a bucket so i can put it on the heads of npcs, or climbing over the capital of cyrodil by stacking 100s of spoons on top of each other? outside of funny youtube clips whats the point? am i suppose to be happy with a shitty looking game because i can pick up every useless trash in the game? 


the only real legit reason that i can think of as to  why bethesda cannot abandon the creation engine is because its so easy to mod. Bethesda put themselves in a hole with this. Bethesda have basically built their entire reputation on having games with huge mod support. and that comes with sacrifices and just imagine the outrage when bethesda makes a game that is  not modable.

As a result I‚Äôm going to try not to opine for an eternity. (I...I failed. I‚Äôm sorry‚Ä¶) I wrote a lot about the questions I had about EoE when I first watched it and you can read that [here.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_n6oQwAXC8KKZov1LRf5u8Wm7hSf4KRFnfh-sIO_CpA/edit?usp=sharing) I mainly focus on ""Kimochi warui"" but most of it comes from [EvaGeeks](http://wiki.evageeks.org/Main_Page) anyway and I encourage everyone to go there. It‚Äôs the best rabbit hole I‚Äôve ever found.

The only thing I must say from my first GoogleDoc is this: does anyone have access to Asuka's alternate line for the beach scene? It was included in the BDs and somehow hasn't found its way onto the internet yet. I would like that audio very much.

I said I was going to talk about the [deleted live action sequence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwBs3VsNfdY) and so I did. Sadly that got too large as well so you'll find that [here.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OBXEKzhvR1zDkkg2iT-ZSfE9HiBLIffq7-j55mR3Hh0/edit?usp=sharing) That essay-ish thing includes spoilers for the Rebuilds.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There are two things I have to talk about though and keep short. The first is Komm Susser Tod. It‚Äôs that song that plays as Instrumentality begins, as the tang begins, that seems really out of place. I *love* the song, but I still don‚Äôt think it fits. [Everything You‚Äôve Ever Dreamed,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95q3APXYveo) also by Arianne, was also recorded for that slot and should‚Äôve been used.

Importantly though, read Anno‚Äôs original [lyrics](http://wiki.evageeks.org/Komm,_s%C3%BCsser_Tod) for both [songs.](http://wiki.evageeks.org/Everything_You've_Ever_Dreamed) Mike Wyzgowski did the best job he could, lyrics are impossible to translate, but Anno‚Äôs original lyrics are gutwrenchingly depressing. They‚Äôre beautiful, but good lord man how did you manage to get out of bed in the morning? Seriously, asking for, uh, a friend.

Also I really want to gage everyone's thoughts concerning Misato's death. There are plenty of debates to be had about Evangelion, there is no one ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù perspective, but I have an opinion about pretty much everything. There are two notable exceptions: Asuka‚Äôs bathtub in e24 and Misato final moments. I don‚Äôt know what to make of these scenes anymore. When I saw them they were simple: Asuka attempted suicide and Misato can only communicate with sex. After watching these scenes a few times I‚Äôm no longer sure of anything. In particular, I watched Evangelion with a women who immediately assumed Misato was simply using sex to motivate Shinji. She didn‚Äôt have a warped perspective but was simply leading him on so that he would save the world. I found it hard to refute her. I‚Äôm curious to see how you all feel.

Final note: the BD‚Äôs for *The End of Evangelion* are beyond beautiful. It‚Äôs like meeting an old friend for the first time all over again. Thank you Khara. Thank you Anno.

Eva is love. Eva is life. It‚Äôs been a pleasure watching with you all. As for me, I‚Äôm going to find a bar that‚Äôs willing to sing Komm Susser Tod as the world comes to a close. It really sounds like a good last-call song to me. I don‚Äôt know, maybe I‚Äôm just crazy.

*God‚Äôs in his heaven, all‚Äôs right with the world.*

The only campground that you don't need reservations for is Camp 4, but it's walk-in (You park then walk to your campsite, no sleeping in the car).  The nearest hostel is the Yosemite Bug, about an hour outside of the park.  They've got a cheap spa that I have heard is very nice (haven't been myself, but lots of staff that live in the park will drive there for the day just to use the spa).

"cwar42w","&gt;I expect that they were all either born Christian or are westernized with poor Arabic skills and nonreligious parents.

Eh, reading the comments, I don't think that's right.

Anyways, as an Arab who lives in an Arab country and would read the entire Qur'an every year for most of my life, I will say it does feel to have a rich vocabulary for a book that old, and it does have a unique style. I think the appeal of the book to me is that it humanized people from a very long time ago and made them relatable (even more when I was no longer religious and speculated more freely about the purpose of verses). However, I think that most people underestimate the ability of people from back then to produce such a book and how similar they were to us, and that underestimation makes them believe that the book is somewhat miraculous to be able to relate to people from this generation.

When it comes to those numbers you mentioned, they're probably the closest thing to miracles I got from Islam. I don't think they make the Qur'an inimitable and beautiful, but they certainly did feel too good to be coincidences and they were probably the last thing that made me hold on to Islam. To be fair, there is a fair deal of nit picking. Yawm being repeated 365 times requires you to omit some variations. For example you use the possessives when searching for imra2a but not Yawm. Also, I think you didn't include [this possessive](http://www.alawfa.com/Go.aspx?keyword=%u0631%u062c%u0644%u0643) when searching for rajul but I may be mistaken since I can't see the ""query details."" I guess I can see Yawm being related to 365 days in a solar year, but dual and plural days being related to a month feel like quite a stretch.

btw, sorry I didn't reply to the long Gulf comment you wrote me some time ago. I read it but I didn't have time to reply that night, and I kept saying I'll do it later. It's silly but I'll quickly reply here about what I remember. The Qatar example was a really good one and I can see why you would think they are artificially made by the British. There are some similarities in the UAE, specially with Abu Dhabi, but I still think, at least in my country, there was a pretty long history of sovereignty for many emirates (like the examples I mentioned in the old comment). The British interest in oil came much later. The Emiratis that believe we fought off the British are just dumb, and as far as I know we don't really have that narrative. Actually I remember a quote from Sheikh Zayed (roughly translated) was: ""The British didn't colonize us. They came and we said 7ayaakom."" I agree with many of the issues you pointed out with the Gulf, but I'm actually not really against ""material reward"" for citizens (despite it stifling political decent). I understand the negative consequences and I've seen them first-hand, but if the country is this rich, I think everyone should enjoy a decent standard of living even if it's by cheap.",1445651633,"i don't think they make the qur'an inimitable and beautiful, but they certainly did feel too good to be coincidences and they were probably the last thing that made me hold on to islam.","inimitable and beautiful","beautiful",NA,FALSE,"inimitable and beautiful","inimitable",NA,NA,0

If you enjoy it, I'm going to throw some other beautiful but slightly weird books your way. Hope you try one and enjoy!


* *People of Paper* by Salvador Plascencia - just so wonderful. In terms of sheer creativity this book is very hard to beat, from a writing standpoint and also just the way he structures the words on the page. I can't say more without spoiling things. Magical realism perfected. If you like *Light Boxes* you will probably enjoy this.

* *The Brief and Frightening Reign of Phil* by George Saunders - I just love this little book. It's a very fast read, and just strange and enjoyable. Not sure what else to say.

* *Motorman* by David Ohle - okay this one is **weird** with like eight capital Ws. He was my creative writing professor in college, and one of the nicest, coolest guys. He's also a great writer. I can't even describe this book but I read it about once a year or two. He was very good friends with William S Burroughs(*Naked Lunch* author) so if you know his work you might have an idea.

* *Vacation* by Deb Olin Unferth - another teacher of mine, but I'm not promoted for the sake of it, I promise! Strange tale of a man who thinks his wife will leave him and follows her(I think, I might be getting this wrong) and I remember it being enjoyable and interesting.

* *Log of the S.S. the Mrs Unguentine* by Stanley Crawford - I don't remember this too well but I read it around the same time as *Light Boxes* and enjoyed it. So it must be similar. I was in the same strange reading mood around then so I would imagine you'd like it.

Just check out the descriptions on Amazon or Goodreads and see if any of those sound like something you'd like. And enjoy *Light Boxes*!

"cvxuog6","Okay, I think by this point this post will get ignored but for once I actually have a story for Ask Reddit! So, hopefully someone will read it and enjoy it!:)

So, my boyfriend and I were hiking on an island of off Tofino, British Columbia. This island is owned by Native Americans, and you pay their community to hike there, even though no one actually lives there. You take a 20-30 minute water taxi ride to the island, hike up it, and then call for the water taxi again when you're done. This hike is supposed to be around 4-5 hours round trip. We started at around 12 pm. 

When we got to the island we got super turned around. We ended up seeing this one lone cow or bull (not sure?) that had giant horns. It was not happy to see us pass. That was weird. We walked by it and eventually found this fucking desolate home. It was probably three stories high, with all of the windows smashed in, full of random crap surrounding it, like a broken swing set. We kept walking and found a broken down truck that was clearly being scrapped for parts. Not one other human. At this point we were pretty creeped out and aware we were lost so we walked back and found the trail head and set off in the right direction. However, the trail was not well maintained at all and we were concerned we were going to get lost. If you haven't been to Canada's raincoast, imagine the jungle but not as hot. So many leaves and trees and vines and cobwebs overhead that it blocks out the sun sometimes. Tons of mud. Trees broken down over the paths. Beautiful, but easy to get turned around in. 

We eventually realized we were on the right track, and we did run into some other hikers who passed us on the way up. We're feeling pretty good at this point and head down the mountain before the other hikers. Eventually, this hikers pass us and we can't hear anyone around us. It is getting close to around 6 pm, and the sun is setting. We took way too long. My boyfriend is going fast and I am slowing him down, he keeps nagging me to hurry up. 

Suddenly, he stops and looks back at me and says ""did you hear that?"" I pause and listen. Nothing. ""I didn't hear anything."" I tell him.  He says, ""it sounded like an animal or like...a person breathing."" I get the chills hearing that but listen again and don't hear anything. I tell him he must be imagining it and we keep going in silence for maybe another ten minutes. Again, he stops suddenly and says ""Listen!"" I stop and listen and yeah, I fucking heard it. Its super heavy breathing from *above* us. We both look up and are scanning the literally thousands of trees above us. We can't see anything, but we can hear it. And it is *not* human. 

We look at each other, and I have never run faster in my life. I was like a bat outta hell and my boyfriend could barley keep up with me. We didn't hear anything again for the rest of the hike, but we paused a few times to listen and looked behind us more times than we could've counted. Some of our friends think it might have been a black bear scared in a tree, or a cougar, but both of those options are still pretty terrifying.

"cvlcuge","Risk is no game. You might think Risk is a game, but, trust me, Risk is no game.

Risk is not something where rock beats scissors or paper covers rock or rock wraps itself up in paper and gives itself as a present to scissors. Risk isn‚Äôt anything like that. Or where paper types something on itself and sues scissors.

Risk isn‚Äôt something where you yell ‚ÄúBingo!‚Äù and then it turns out you don‚Äôt have bingo after all, and what are the rules again? Risk isn‚Äôt that, my friend.

Risk isn‚Äôt something where you roll the dice and move your battleship around a board and land on a hotel and act like your battleship is having sex with the hotel.

Risk isn‚Äôt tiddlywinks, where you flip your tiddly over another player‚Äôs tiddly and an old man winks at you because he thought it was a good move. Risk isn‚Äôt that at all.

Risk isn‚Äôt something where you sink a birdie or hit a badminton birdie or do anything at all with birdies. Look, just forget birdies, O.K.?

Maybe you think Risk is all one big joke, like the farmer with the beautiful but promiscuous daughter. But what they don‚Äôt tell you is the farmer became so depressed that he eventually took his own life.

Risk is not some brightly colored, sugarcoated piece of candy that you can brush the ants off of and pop in your mouth.

Risk is not playtime or make-believe. Risk is real. It‚Äôs as real as a beggar squatting by the side of the road, begging, and then you realize, Uh-oh, he‚Äôs not begging.

Risk is as real as a baby deer calling out for his mother. But his mother won‚Äôt be coming home anytime soon, because she is drunk in a bar somewhere.

It‚Äôs as real as a mummy who still thinks he‚Äôs inside a pyramid, but he‚Äôs actually in a museum in Ohio.

Risk is not something where you can dress your kid up like a hobo and send him out trick-or-treating, because, first of all, your kid‚Äôs twenty-three, and, secondly, he really is a hobo.

All of this probably sounds oldfashioned and ‚Äúsquare‚Äù to you. But if loving your wife, your country, your cats, your girlfriend, your girlfriend‚Äôs sister, and your girlfriend‚Äôs sister‚Äôs cat is ‚Äúsquare,‚Äù then so be it.

You go skipping and prancing through life, skipping through a field of dandelions. But what you don‚Äôt see is that on each dandelion is a bee, and on each bee is an ant, and the ant is biting the bee and the bee is biting the flower, and if that shocks you then I‚Äôm sorry.

You have never had to struggle to put food on the table, let alone put food on a plate and try to balance it on a spoon until it gets to your mouth.

You will never know what it‚Äôs like to work on a farm until your hands are raw, just so people can have fresh marijuana. Or what it‚Äôs like to go to a factory and put in eight long hours and then go home and realize that you went to the wrong factory.

You will never grasp the quiet joy of holding your own baby, or the quiet comedy of handing him back to his ‚Äúfather.‚Äù

I used to be like you. I would put my napkin in my lap, instead of folding it into a little tent over my plate, like I do now, with a door for the fork to go in.

I would go to parties and laugh‚Äîand laugh and laugh‚Äîevery time somebody said something, in case it was supposed to be funny. I would walk in someplace and slap down a five-dollar bill and say, ‚ÄúGive me all you got,‚Äù and not even know what they had there. And whenever I found two of anything I would hold them up to my head like antlers, and then pretend that one ‚Äúantler‚Äù fell off.

I went waltzing along, not caring where I stepped or if the other person even wanted to waltz.

Food seemed to taste better back then. Potatoes were more potatoey, and turnips less turnippy.

But then something happened, something that would make me understand that Risk is no game. I was walking past a building and I saw a man standing high up on a ledge. ‚ÄúJump! Jump!‚Äù I started yelling. What happened next would haunt me for the rest of my days: the man came down from the building and beat the living daylights out of me. Ever since then, I‚Äôve realized that Risk is no game.

Maybe one day it will be a game again. Maybe you‚Äôll be able to run up and kick a pumpkin without people asking why you did that and if you‚Äôre going to pay for it.

Perhaps one day the Indian will put down his tomahawk and the white man will put down his gun, and the white man will pick up his gun again because, Ha-ha, sucker.

One day we‚Äôll just sit by the fire, chew some tobacky, toast some marshmackies, and maybe strum a tune on the ole guitacky.

And maybe one day we‚Äôll tip our hats to the mockingbird, not out of fear but out of friendliness.

These are examples of a Japanese graphic work resulting from an art style called ukiyo-e, which roughly translates as images of the floating world.

The general idea behind the art style was that life is full of divinely beautiful but fleeting moments that are here one second and gone the next.

That moment when you catch a pretty girl smiling in the market place only to disappear into the crowd again. Or that moment when the wind gently nudges a cherry blossom to be perfectly posed in a ray of sunlight. That moment when a kabuki actor strikes a pose and seem to be filled with the spirit of the heroic samurai he is representing.

Ukiyo-e aims to capture those moments in an art style that is just as swift and fleeting to produce and feels just as swift and fleeting as the moment it depicts. There are older ukiyo-e paintings that are painted in just a few brush strokes. Some are even painted in a single flourishing brush stroke.

Of course art is expensive and mostly the upper class owned art. When woodblock printing developed many ukiyo-e artists started producing work for woodblocks. Leading to a virtual revolution in art where even the lower classes could afford to have creative works in their homes.

In that sense ukiyo-e was actually far ahead of the rest of the world. Today we love decorating our homes with affordable creative expression. Japan was one of the first places in the world that mass produced work by famous artists in a way that common people could afford.

Incidentally, 17th century renaissance era painters didn't magically discover realism. It was just an art style that became popular again. The Greeks did fantastic realistic statuary in bronze and marble for instance and that was before the birth of Christ.

Throughout most of the middle ages, art simply often had other priorities. For instance in battle scenes it was far more important to clearly depict who had been present by showing their coat of arms in an almost stylistic manner rather than realism. 

There's some pretty realistic paintings of Jezus and other biblical figures that predate the renaissance by centuries. It just wasn't the prevalent art style at the time. Just like realism wasn't the prevalent art style in Japan during the European renaissance.",1442297743,"the general idea behind the art style was that life is full of divinely beautiful but fleeting moments that are here one second and gone the next.","beautiful but fleeting","beautiful","but",FALSE,"divinely beautiful but fleeting","fleeting","divinely",NA,1

"cuwahvw","Here's mine. My wife and I got invited to her co-worker's wedding. It was scheduled to start at 6pm. We showed up 30 minutes early so we'd have plenty of time to park, mingle, and find our seats since we didn't really know anybody.  

**5:30**  
We arrive and there was barely anybody there. It was at a beautiful and massive catering hall that also featured a glassblowing museum.  
The archway and seats were set up outside, and the pulpit had a 12 pack of mountain dew on it. It wasn't displayed tastefully or anything, like an inside joke of the bride and groom. No it was just sitting there like someone was drinking it while setting up chairs.  

**5:45**  
Still barely anyone there. We're sitting in 90 degrees, my wife is 7 months pregnant, we're hungry, starting to get bored and a little grumpy. Our fault I guess. But that Mountain Dew is *still sitting there*. Isn't anyone going to start cleaning up and getting ready?  

**6:00**  
Finally it's time... right? Guests *start* arriving. They casually walk up like it's no big deal. Hey, it's not our family so who are we to judge, right? But still. This just looked rude as all hell. Someone ran up to the pulpit and put the Mountain Dew under it, then took a can for themselves.  

**6:30**  
People are still filtering in. There are approximately 60 seats, all of which are occupied now, and a couple hundred people are standing around behind them. Odd, but okay...  

**7:00**  
Bride and groom are arriving! I start to get hangry, having assumed that I'd be stuffing my face with lasagna by this point. They get led around the courtyard in a cart pulled by a white horse and it really is quite beautiful. But fuck me, it's an hour late. I know I know, not my family and I shouldn't care that much, but seriously?  
Meanwhile the crowd is chattering and playing with their phones.  

**7:30**  
The ceremony actually starts, holy shit.  
The bride talks too quietly for the microphone to pick up her voice, not that it matters since the crowd is just talking over her anyway. When it comes time for vows, the officiant asks everyone to quiet down. Nobody hears him. They're chit chatting like it's a fucking family reunion BBQ and nobody hears the vows.  
This one particular chick behind me is talking half to her friend next to her and half on her cell phone.  
The officiant's voice rises (with a hint of passive aggression). ""You may now kiss the bride.""  
That loud girl behind me puts down her phone and remarks ""Oh, they ain't said no vows?""  

**8:00**  
We've been standing in line for who knows how long. 10 minutes maybe? Feels like an hour. When are they going to open the door to the dining room?  

**8:30**  
Still waiting. But there's news filtering backward from the front of the line; apparently out of 300 guests, only 120 RSVP'd. The staff are getting tables ready and cooking extra food.  
I immediately pull my wife outside.  
""Honey, we *need* to get out of here.""  
She heartily agrees. We quietly sneak away and leave the room. Problem is, it's a very long walk to the parking lot through an open area. The kind of walk you wouldn't dare take if there were a sniper after you.  
We were so close.  
There was a sniper after us. Figuratively, anyway. She was another coworker and called us out by name. ""They opened the doors! You can go in now! I told so-and-so that you were leaving and she felt so bad!""  
I didn't say ""FUCKGODDAMNITYOUSONOFABITCHSHUTTHEFUCKUP there is *no way* they're going to notice we're missing out of the *300* fucking guests that actually know anybody here! Shit! Leave us alone!""  
Instead of saying that, we abandoned our quest for freedom and slunk back. There were no chairs for us, but there was a table. It was table # 99 or some shit, and was farthest from the serving troughs. Two waiters were standing next to us looking like they were having even less fun than we were, and also refusing to bring us water or silverware.  
I walk up to the bar and grab two bottles of water. I have my doubts that there will be any food left for us by the time our table is called, which may well be after midnight.

""‚ÄúI'm sorry, but I don't want to be an emperor. That's not my business. I don't want to rule or conquer anyone. I should like to help everyone if possible; Jew, Gentile, black man, white. We all want to help one another. Human beings are like that. We want to live by each other's happiness, not by each other's misery. We don't want to hate and despise one another. In this world there is room for everyone, and the good earth is rich and can provide for everyone. The way of life can be free and beautiful, but we have lost the way. Greed has poisoned men's souls, has barricaded the world with hate, has goose-stepped us into misery and bloodshed. We have developed speed, but we have shut ourselves in. Machinery that gives abundance has left us in want. Our knowledge has made us cynical; our cleverness, hard and unkind. We think too much and feel too little. More than machinery, we need humanity. More than cleverness, we need kindness and gentleness. Without these qualities, life will be violent and all will be lost. The airplane and the radio have brought us closer together. The very nature of these inventions cries out for the goodness in men; cries out for universal brotherhood; for the unity of us all. Even now my voice is reaching millions throughout the world, millions of despairing men, women, and little children, victims of a system that makes men torture and imprison innocent people. To those who can hear me, I say, do not despair. The misery that is now upon us is but the passing of greed, the bitterness of men who fear the way of human progress. The hate of men will pass, and dictators die, and the power they took from the people will return to the people. And so long as men die, liberty will never perish. Soldiers! Don't give yourselves to brutes, men who despise you, enslave you; who regiment your lives, tell you what to do, what to think and what to feel! Who drill you, diet you, treat you like cattle, use you as cannon fodder. Don't give yourselves to these unnatural men - machine men with machine minds and machine hearts! You are not machines, you are not cattle, you are men! You have the love of humanity in your hearts! You don't hate! Only the unloved hate; the unloved and the unnatural. Soldiers! Don't fight for slavery! Fight for liberty! In the seventeenth chapter of St. Luke, it is written that the kingdom of God is within man, not one man nor a group of men, but in all men! In you! You, the people, have the power, the power to create machines, the power to create happiness! You, the people, have the power to make this life free and beautiful, to make this life a wonderful adventure. Then in the name of democracy, let us use that power. Let us all unite. Let us fight for a new world, a decent world that will give men a chance to work, that will give youth a future and old age a security. By the promise of these things, brutes have risen to power. But they lie! They do not fulfill that promise. They never will! Dictators free themselves but they enslave the people. Now let us fight to fulfill that promise. Let us fight to free the world!

"cu7e382","TL;DR:Why not find a legitimate unicorn that *can* have children?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I know not how others see it; but as for me, I see Don Juaning as making dreams come true.

Dreams! The spice of life, the universal spring of success! But I must be wrong, for Bryan Redford says, ‚Äùstick to your own league.""(http://www.sosuave.com/home/redfield/bryan22.htm)

Stick to your own league! What does that mean? Does that mean there exists an aristocracy of genetics, and that we happened to be on the bottom, the status of clowns and peasants to these princesses and princes?

‚ÄúForgive me, madam. But you, dear, are out of my league.‚Äù Is this what we should say to the girls we find gorgeous and beautiful? But why stop there? Why not ask, ‚ÄúOh, please, may I have permission to speak to you, princess?‚Äù or ‚ÄúThank you, dear, for letting me be in your graceful presence.‚Äù

‚ÄúPook, you exaggerate.‚Äù

Do I? Don‚Äôt misunderstand. I think Redford has some wise things to say, but that column of desiring beautiful women is the worst advice I‚Äôve seen. Never cede your dreams for you risk losing your soul.

Redford says that there does in fact exist ‚Äòleagues‚Äô, a type of genetic (or social) aristocracy. Just as one would love crumbs and blobs of fat if you were starving, Redford compares overweight women to absolutely no women (taking a page out of the ‚ÄòHow to Love Fat Bloated Hags‚Äô, a sub-genre of the worst relationship books).
Redford then says‚Ä¶ Wait! I will let him speak for himself:

""By that I mean no matter how great you think you are, or how deserving you feel you may be, the real world put you back in your place and gave you a reality check. You eventually accept it, adjust to it and learn to appreciate and enjoy your Honda. You also learn rather quickly that a Honda can take you to the exact same places a Mercedes can take you to.""

Now for those of you who are cheering his words as ‚ÄúWonderful!‚Äù and ‚ÄúBrilliant!‚Äù, I ask only for a full actualization of his advice.

Let us place Redford in front of a custodian. Speak, Redford:

‚ÄúHow are you! You may think that you can do better but the real world puts you in your place and gives you a reality check. You must accept it, adjust to it and learn to appreciate and enjoy your custodial duties.‚Äù

And if the custodian responds, ‚ÄúI know I can do better,‚Äù what would Redford say? Quiet! Let us hear him:

‚ÄúIf you were starving, would you scoff at your work? No! You would get on your hands and knees and thank God for your fortune. You also learn that a custodian‚Äôs paycheck feeds and clothes you just as any other paycheck would.‚Äù

This ‚Äòadvice‚Äô is called Settling for Mediocrity. If you do it with women, why not use it for every other avenue of your life? Mediocrity in the pursuit for a splinter of joy is no joy at all. For me, the pursuit of the dream is the joy.

The letter writer did admit that he was physically overweight. But that does not mean he has to settle and cede his dreams. (I for one would not want a Mercedes or a very nice car since I know it would be stolen. But if you want a Mercedes, just go get one. There are no limits to what we can accomplish.)

A friend of mine is also faced in a similar situation. He is twenty six, lives with his parents, works at the same grocery store for more then half a decade, has no long term plans for the future, doesn‚Äôt work out, and demands a beautiful woman. Obviously, he is caught in a bubble of fantasy.

There is nothing wrong with going for high standards. But, there is a catch. It is this catch, when not obeyed, will keep you in that bubble of fantasy. In fact, Shakespeare has saying on it in which he says‚Ä¶

‚ÄúThe catch, Pook. Get to the catch.‚Äù

Very well. Here it is:

The high standards you apply to your desires must be applied to yourself.

Do you want a woman who is not overweight? Then you must eliminate your overweight. Do you want a woman who is intellectually brilliant? Then you must hit the books, read the classics, think, and expand your mind. Do you want a woman who is athletic? Then you too must become athletic.

Try, if you want, to get a woman who is better then you in these traits. You may or may not succeed. But only demand that which you can reflect as well. This forces you on the path of self-improvement.

Let me tell you a story. In my late Nice Guy phase, I fell infatuated with this girl. (Yeah, not uncommon. I know.) And like every Nice Guy, I dreamed of our blissful future. When I would get around her, I become very tense with butterflies in my stomach. Oh, how I dreamed about her! More important, I dreamed about us. So I eventually bit the bullet and asked her out. Guess what her response was?

No.

No.

She said no! My soul buckled and I was literally crushed.

Later, when I shrugged off that Nice Guyness, I was looking for a girlfriend. I thought a break came when a girl, a bit homely, had fallen in love with me a few months later. I thought, ‚ÄúShould I go for her?‚Äù Then I realized, ‚ÄúNO!‚Äù (Later, I realized that she and my crush were good friends. I eventually found out my crush tried to ‚Äòset us up‚Äô.) I knew I could do better. And I did.

By focusing on my interests, on my goals, on my improvement, everything changed. Other girls started to take an interest in me. Soon, I became the biggest mystery. My ‚Äòcrush‚Äô is bewildered for her friends have the hots for me and older women say, ‚ÄúHow I wish I were twenty years younger!‚Äù I became the guy the girls talked about when they were alone. And she had placed me in the ‚Äòaverage‚Äô category. Ha!

Of course, I lost all attraction for her. I felt embarrassed about my past self. How could I get so whipped by a chick I hardly talked to? Now it doesn‚Äôt matter, for I have the mindset that I‚Äôm going to win the world.

Perhaps you can relate to the story. But the point is that I disagree with Redford in this: The fault is not in the standards; it is ourselves. The failure is not in our high standards; it is failing to apply those standards in ourselves.

There IS an aristocracy. But it is not an aristocracy of genetics; it is an aristocracy of WILL and PASSION. Name any name in history, any grand person in present, and see if it was their DRIVE that got them where they are. There is no lottery of life. The leagues you see are the ones you create in your own mind. Anyone can get a beauty. Hell, even Voltaire had the audacity to say, ‚ÄúGive me ten minutes of talk and I shall bed the Queen of France.‚Äù

Aim high! And as each standard increases, so does yourself. In this manner, you benefit from your fantasy for now it is tethered to reality, yanking you forward in your proper destiny.

Aim high! And behold, for everything shall become new. The women you were lusting for earlier will seem lowly, for you have been on the course of self-improvement while they have not. You worked out; they remained scrawny. You read; they wasted their time. You saved your money and pulled yourself up; they are locked in debt.

Aim high! For Redford says, ‚ÄúYour life depends on it,‚Äù and he is more correct then ever, but not in how he means it.

Here is your choice: settle for mediocrity or aim high. The former is simple, can occur right now, and only requires the selling of your dreams. The latter demands rigor, the higher you aim the more rigorous, but your dreams can come true.

Aim high! For Strindberg says, ‚ÄúI dream, therefore I exist.‚Äù For to dream is to become.",1439926370,"is this what we should say to the girls we find gorgeous and beautiful?","gorgeous and beautiful","beautiful",NA,FALSE,"gorgeous and beautiful","gorgeous",NA,NA,0

The assembled nobles, from all the great houses of Westeros, stood and applauded as their new king was took his oath, was crowned by the High Septon and climbed the steps to the Iron Throne.

""It has been a month of mourning,"" said Aerys, sitting upon the throne for the first time, ""mourning for the terrible loss of our beloved Queen, my mother, taken by the Gods before her time. But at last we have something to celebrate."" The nobles applauded again.

The ceremony was over, and Aerys sat at the feasting table in the freezing gardens of the Red Keep exchanging polite, if somewhat frosty conversation with his new wife. Braziers burned all around the assembled guests to keep them warm, and the musicians played ‚ÄúOn Wings of Fire‚Äù, a popular ballad composed about his mother's conquests his family had adopted as their house song.

Daughter of the Lord of the Reach, widow to the Lord of the Stormlands and mother to the Lady of the Stormlands, charming, graceful and only 19 to boot!.‚Äù  Aerys just shrugged.

‚ÄúI know, son. At your age tits and wine were all I was interested in too,‚Äù Tyrion gestured at [Jaehaerys Waters](http://i.imgur.com/Eylyxin.jpg), Aerys' bastard, ‚Äúand you are certainly my son.‚Äù

‚ÄúThen why did I have to marry so young?‚Äù replied Aerys, keeping his voice low so his wife couldn't hear, ‚ÄúJust a few more years to be young would have been...‚Äù
‚Äú
Because you are king and she is a perfect match,‚Äù Tyrion cut Aerys off ‚ÄúA good man puts family before the wishes and whims of his...‚Äù Tyrion paused, a look of self-loathing, a look he wore all too often these days, passing fleetingly across his face. ‚ÄúShe is young and beautiful son,‚Äù Tyrion said softly, ‚ÄúYou will not be unhappy.‚Äù He gave Aerys' shoulder a squeeze, ‚ÄúNow I think I'm going to ask the musicians to play The Rains of Castamere,‚Äù he said with a smile, ‚ÄúScare the piss out of this oh-so dignified assembly.‚Äù

***

Tyrion and Rhaella, Aerys' sister and Empress of New Valyria, danced together laughing, surrounded by other revellers. *Rhaella has always been father's favourite* Aerys thought *his only daughter and a dwarf like him.* His brother Barristan was nowhere to be seen. He realised Malora had been talking to him for some time.
‚ÄúOf course, she was horrified when she actually saw him,‚Äù she said.
‚ÄúOf course,‚Äù Aerys replied. He returned his attention to her. She wasn't beautiful but she had a certain quality about her, a liveliness, that made her very attractive. At least the bedding wouldn't be a chore, maybe he'd give the signal to begin the bedding now.

A deafening roar silenced the party goers and musicians.

A chill went through Aerys as he recognized the roar of Drogon, the Black Dread, his mother's dragon which had gone wild and been chained in the dragon pit since her death. A dark shadow suddenly passed over the city.

***

Aerys and  Rhaella ran together towards the dragon pit, flanked by their guards.

‚ÄúDid it someone let it out?‚Äù Aerys' older sister said,

‚ÄúIt's guarded constantly by twenty guards,‚Äù Aerys replied, ‚Äúsomeone would have had to...‚Äù
They arrived at the dragon pit entrance to a scene of slaughter. His twenty guards lay dead or dying on the ground and beside them lay a couple of soldiers, unmistakably of the Legions of Ghiscar.

"ctblwqs","Yes, kind of. DOTA 2 Reborn is the first Beta featuring Source 2. 

There's a lot of approaches to Source 2 and CSGO

1) - Hopeful Version: Given that CSGO is a precision FPS game with such a huge Competitive base (DOTA 2 has competitive but winning is much less dependent on the Engine physics) I'm thinking that CSGO or CS:Source 2 (if they make us buy another game) will probably be last to make sure everything is running tip top. I suspect that the first FPS game to get Source 2 will likely be something less popular in the competitive world like TF2.. 

2) Steam is an evil profiteering corporation so there is also a really good chance this could be a HL3 + TF2 + CS:S2 poop release, and we can all buy it cause we're fanboys like that then deal with Valve fixing all the issues over the next 5 years like with CSGO.  This would absolutely require them transferring all of your CSGO skins over to the new game or nobody would switch.

3) DOTA 2 Reborn beta is a beta test for Source 2 and not DOTA 2 Reborn, and once it comes out of beta they will being Source 2 betas for Half-Life 2 games. 

The most logical thing Steam can do is just update CSGO to implement Source 2. CSGO is established and strong so there is absolutely no reason to try to start milking a new cow when you're milking the golden cow. If Steam is smart, this will all happen around the time that ~~Skynet~~ SteamBox goes live (November 10th, 2015) This would mean that a new ""hot"" engine is released in a fully SteamBox compatible version driving up sales while poking Sony and Microsoft in a place they will be hurting. 

That all being said, I do hope Valve doesn't rush anything. There are a lot of issues that are MUST FIX or MUST INCLUDE.. They have to write it all down, and implement it all with Source 2 so we can all rejoice and praise Gaben. 128 tick MM is a MUST. Fixing the Redirect DDOS vulnerability is a MUST. They could also go a long way by finally scrapping the old-school Server Browser GUI and making something much more beautiful but still similar.

"ct567ek","Hi there :D 

For my entry, I chose to draw a horse... BUT not just any horse! I decided to draw an: 

[ANGRY MONSTER HORSE FIGHTING AN EBAY SCUMTURD](https://imgur.com/a/AI4IU) :D

The reason why I drew an ANGRY MONSTER HORSE FIGHTING AN EBAY SCUMTURD is that I was recently a victim of Ebay scumturdery, and a MONSTER HORSE is the only powerful thing that could chase and punish the bad guy! Just imagine this. Last week was the SDCC event (San Diego Comic Convention). At that event, you can buy all sorts of exclusive and rare things, especially toys! I am a very huge Dragonball fan, and it just so happened that there's an exclusive Dragonball toy called Frieza Saga Goku.

I went on Ebay and I pre-ordered it from someone who's supposed to be an SDCC ""veteran"". I paid in full because that's how things are supposed to work. Pay and then the person sends you the stuff. I used the $50 Ebay coupon I worked so hard for last month to partially pay for it, and then I used my own $50 from the bank to complete the payment. An SDCC ""veteran"" means that he's somebody people have already trusted and used to purchase things from the SDCC event. Even his feedback was 100% positive. I had no reason to doubt and fear that this guy would be a total turd and just take advantage of me. 

In the first few days of the event, he said he had trouble getting an SDCC 2015 Goku for me. Finally, he contacted me and said he got one for me! I was so happy and cheerful at that time because Goku's my favorite hero of all time! I thought I was gonna have my Goku delivered to me this Monday.

Monday came and he suddenly wrote to me and said his car broke down and when he stayed at a motel, all of the stuff he bought from SDCC, including my Goku, got stolen!!! At first I felt sorry for him, but then my suspicion arose. It's just so timely for this to happen. Other Dragonball fans who tried to buy the toy also told me that their contacts at SDCC suddenly got robbed or something bad happened, and so their orders were also cancelled! Very very verrrrryyyy suspicious!

I started investigating this guy and tracked him down on the net. I found him on a place where he sells most of his stuff, another board that specializes in toy sales. I saw that on the date that he said he got robbed, he made a list where he said he sold GOKU and other SDCC exclusives. How can that be when his vehicle was supposed to be broken and he just got robbed? How did this guy even get home? Where did the stuff he just sold come from? 

I'm a very nice person. I'm very honest. Even when people are trying to bullshit me, I just play along sometimes just to keep peace. This time though, I got really reaallllllyyyy.... EXTREMELY MAD.

According to Ebay, they can't refund my $50 coupon (but I'm gonna go call PAYPAL and see what they can do about this). In other words, that guy probably used my money to buy some more Gokus at the SDCC event, and when he finally had them, he sold them for a higher price and then CANCELLED my damn order. Yes, I was USED, ABUSED, and ROBBED of my $50 Ebay coupon.

Want evidence? PM me and I'll show you the pictures, he really pisses me off I'm so angry....

ANYWAY, I reported the guy to the administrators of his site. The admins said that while they cannot return me the $50 Ebay coupon, they will be watching this guy closely and will use my evidence and report when more people speak up about his terrible business ethics. The administrators even gave me VIP status on their site out of sympathy, although that doesn't mean anything to me because I never really intend to stay there. I only signed up for their site just to report that SCUMTURD and get him in the trouble he deserves. 

Yes, I drew this ANGRY MONSTER HORSE FIGHTING AN EBAY SCUMTURD out of anger and rage. I used your contest to release the intense madness that's been building up inside me. I just hate it when I've been honest and good to the person, and he ends up not honoring our deal that I fully paid for!!! He even caused me to lose my $50 non-refundable Ebay coupon just so he could sell Goku for a higher price elsewhere! I feel so used!!! I'm the one without an SDCC 2015 Goku now while he has lots of money because my payment helped him secure more Gokus to sell from SDCC!!! That's really reaaaaalllyyyyyyy REAAAALLLYYY ENRAGING!!! 

Now to explain what's going on in my drawing. Basically, when I drew this, I fantasized that I somehow had a horse and I genetically altered it into a Horse-Man-Beast. I then programmed it to hunt down the damn EBAY SCUMTURD and then commit acts of extreme violence on him &gt;: D

I've always viewed horses as noble, peaceful, yet extremely powerful creatures. Just look at their bodies. They're very muscular even though they look cute! They simply want to live in peace, and when they make friends, they sometimes run along with their human pals. UNFORTUNATELY, some people will abuse a person's kindness even if the person's been so good to them. At this point, it's time to unleash the true POWER of the HORSE! I believe in fairness and justice, to always be an honorable person, very much like what the horse symbolizes. Yet, when taken advantage of, then it's time to also seek vengeance like a horse kicking its attacker! 

The Monster Horse is RED. It simply represents the anger within me at the EBAY SCUMTURD. The horse's mane and tail are yellow. This is simply a reference to Dragonball's ""Super Saiyan"" forms, where when one of the main heroes powers up, his hair turns yellow and becomes more powerful. The horse's eyes are WHITE. It represents purity and honesty. An ANGRY PURITY AND HONESTY because that EBAY SCUMTURD really did something bad to me.

For the EBAY SCUMTURD, his eyes are white simply because he got knocked out and lost consciousness after being hit by the horse's justified punch. His jaw got dislocated due to the force of the attack, and his teeth broke and got blown away. He is wearing a GREEN shirt. Green signifies money, the DOLLAR. He got too GREEDY and that's why even though all he had to do was send me my Goku, he decided to string me along his lies and then sell Goku elsewhere for a much higher price. HE HAS NO HONOR. His pants are BROWN because I want him to crap himself when he realizes I investigated him and already have reported him to the administrators.

The colorful bunch of lines represent KARMA. Notice how KARMA builds up from behind the horse and then dives right in the direction of the SCUMTURD'S head. YES, I want KARMA to hit him HARD. I want it to hit him so HARD that he would REGRET all the bad things he did not just to me, but to the other people who ordered Goku from him. I am not alone. There were other people whom he victimized! I want all of the combined KARMA to really PUNISH him.

There is a box containing the SDCC 2015 Goku toy. He lost hold of it. What this means is that even though I've lost my $50 Ebay coupon because of this SCUMTURD, I am still hopeful that somehow, one way or another, I would still end up having an SDCC 2015 Goku in my hands. He is currently $180+ on Amazon I definitely cannot buy that now, but I'm still hoping that KARMA would find a way to get it in my hands so that I can make stop motion videos of my favorite hero.

The beautiful but powerful yellow orange explosion behind the SCUMTURD represents JUSTICE. I hope that everything will end properly. Just like the randomness of EXPLOSIONS in real life, ugly things like being scammed and tricked can happen to anyone. Still, out of this horrible situation, I am hoping that GOOD will find a way to prevail, and BAD people like that EBAY SCUMTARD would get the punishment they truly deserve &gt;: D

That's the story of why I drew the ANGRY MONSTER HORSE FIGHTING EBAY SCUMTURD. I hope you were entertained by it :D

"cssnaf5","Another day, another bruise. At least that's how most of my days went up until recently. At 5'8"" and 140 pounds I look like the average guy on the surface. I have black hair, that I admit is a little on the shaggy side, but what irregular 17 year old's hair isn't, light brown eyes, and absolutely nothing remarkable about me. I used to think that my single redeeming factor was that I am a relatively sharp guy. I was wrong. I live in a place where people play football everyday, drink beer every night, and pick on losers like me in between. On top of that every person in this place thinks that the  only two types of music that exist are country and gospel.
     
Austin Fredrickson is the captain of the football team, and unfortunately in almost every single one of my classes. At 6'3"" and 210 pounds he has to be half giant or ogre. I'm assuming the latter because he struggles with saying any words more than 2 syllables, and has to use the words fuck, bitch, and pussy in almost every sentence he can come up with in his tiny little brain.He and his dumb jock friends constantly shove me into lockers, knock books out of my hands, and ruin my entire life. If you think your Monday's are bad, mine are literally the bane of my existence. 

So as I was saying before, my days used to be pretty plain in regards to routine. Wake up, kiss mom goodbye, skateboard to school, get some sort of abuse from Austin and his cronies, continue said abuse until the end of school, then skate home with some more bruises and go to sleep. Repeat. Now things are much more complicated, and of course they have something to do with Austin fucking Fredrickson.

It started out as any other Friday. I arrived at school around 7:45, just like all the other sheep, and went to my locker trying to avoid contact as usual. I even made it all the way from my locker and through the next class without an incident. Then Austin arrived.

The official ruling was that he over slept from the big win last night over our rivals, Fullerton High Panthers, but he was probably just too hung over to function in the morning. I was on my way to my next class when I felt gorilla hands grab my hood and pull me backwards roughly and slam me into a locker.

""Well if it isn't Avalon High's biggest pussy.""

His breath reeked of cheap whiskey and vomit, and I was hard pressed to keep my breakfast down as his gaping noise hole came into uncomfortably close proximity to my nostrils. 

""And if it isn't the worlds biggest douche bag."" I replied without missing a beat. I never claimed to be tough, but I learned a long time before that it is much better to stand your ground than be walked on willingly.

"" You talk pretty tough for some punk bitch. I thought you were supposed to be some sort of genius. If you're so fucking smart why don't you know to keep your mouth shut?""

""Because I'm not as smart as you think, but that's not hard considering most 1st graders can spell more words than you can say."" 

I received a solid fist to the stomach that blasted the air from my lungs. I couldn't let him see how bad it hurt though, or he would just do it again. 

""Not so smart now are you bitch?"" He slammed me against another locker and pushed his face into mine again. ""You're the biggest pussy in the world. I bet you're a faggot and take it up the ass.""

""That's funny, because I heard that's what your dad does to you on the weekends you visit him."" That caused the world to go black and spin for a minute. When I came back to reality I was laying on the floor with cowboy boots being kicked into my ribs repeatedly. He picked me up and slammed me into the locker again, and banged my head against it for good measure.

""If you ever talk about my dad again I will fucking kill you."" He socked me in the stomach again and let me fall to the floor. I guess he slammed me enough to make the lock malfunction because it creaked open as I fell, and he got another bright idea. He grabbed me roughly from the floor and shoved me into the locker and locked it.

""I'll let you out when you grow a pair and stop being such a pussy. Do yourself a favor and kill yourself while you're in there."" He stomped away and left me to remain in the cramped space that is a locker.

I have never been one for crying. I learned how to keep things contained inside me after my dad died when I was 10. I watched my mom go through enough suffering, so I learned to keep my problems to myself. One side effect of that way of coping is constant depression. I have a bad habit of replaying all the negatives in my head over and over like a skipping CD. The one smart thing that dipshit did say was ""Kill yourself."" The words repeated themselves over, and over, and over, each time gaining more power like a blacksmith striking metal until it finally gives. I reached into the pocket of my hoodie and pulled out the razor I had kept with me for the past 4 years. I had started cutting after it finally hit me that my dad was gone and I was just a burden to my mom. Denice Wolcot was a strong woman who would never admit that her life would be easier without me. She found the diary I tried to start once, and sent me to counciling. When she read it and saw that I had wrote ""I think my mom wishes, I had died instead of dad."" she flipped out. She took me to some quack therapist who just drew during all the sessions. I just played the game and ""recovered"". I was declared to be in good mental health, and never brought it up again. After therapy I found my own way of coping was by being in control of the pain. Thus my trusty razor blade.

I held the razor on my wrist and began to consider the options. On the down side I would be dead. On the plus side my mom wouldn't have to take care of me anymore. She wouldn't have to put up with the glances from the other mothers whenever they talked about their kids and how well they were doing. She could just move away and start over fresh and forget about all the bad things that had happened in this god forsaken town. I wouldn't have to deal with Austin anymore, and I wouldn't have this damn pain. I wouldn't be a burden. I wouldn't feel pain. Just as I got the nerve to start the last cut I would ever make I felt a strange sense of openness. I couldn't feel the cold metal of the locker on my back and I wasn't cramped anymore. I turned my head and saw that I wasn't even in a locker anymore. 

I was on a beach with pearl white sand facing a vast ocean on a sunny day. I turned around to see a vast open field ending with a forest that extended as far as I could see. At first I thought I was dead and had moved on to the after life, but I realized something wasn't quite right with that theory when I noticed a small line of blood on my wrist from the razor that was still pressed to my skin. The dead don't bleed, and they definitely don't feel pain. I put the razor back in my pocket. I sat down in the sand and tried to make sense of what happened. I started to mentally retrace the steps that had happened to get me into this moment. I made it to the point where I was shoved into the locker when a thought occurred to me. Am I trapped here?

I stood up quickly and tried to find the locker that I had come out of. It had somehow disappeared after I stepped out of it, and I started to panic. I ran down the beach until I couldn't run anymore. The scenery never changed. It was like I hadn't moved at all. I looked back to see how far I had traveled and I was even more disturbed when I realized I hadn't moved at all. I hadn't taken a single step. 

I began to wonder if I was delusional when suddenly I was back inside the locker. I slammed myself into the door until the lock finally gave way and I sprawled out into the hallway. I got up and ran as fast as I could back to my house. When I got home I locked myself in my room and laid on my bed. I tried to make sense of what had happened, and I began to calm down. I must have hit my head pretty hard when Austin slammed me against the locker, or when he hit me, or when I hit the floor. I must have just been delirious from the blows. My the back of my hear really hurt so I took a Tylenol and went straight to bed. 

I woke up the next morning and my head didn't hurt anymore. ""That was a crazy dream I had."" I muttered to myself I got up groggily and went to the mirror and saw all the bruises from yesterday. ""maybe I should change tactics with Austin."" I thought after further examination of some of the darker bruises. It was a miracle he didn't break anything. I began to get dressed for school and went downstairs for some breakfast. Mom was already gone to work, but she had left me some breakfast. I ate it and thought about my dream. It had been beautiful but desolate. I know enough about dreams that I know they are just a representation of the subconscious. What could it mean? What was the point of it?  Why couldn't I move? After a few moments of contemplation I chalked it up to the head trauma again and went to finish getting dressed. I got all my clothes on and grabbed my bag, but I saw something just as I was about to put on my shoes. There was something on my shoes.

Everything about their encounter is so atmospheric and wonderful - the beautiful but macabre portrait, the way they convene through it and how the camera jumps to the portrait of the one speaking, the music, the malevolence and the hideous reveal of their true form. You literally EAT the atmosphere in the portrait scene.

"csaw6r8","I want to start by saying all of these are mods I have either used or tried out.

This is pretty much my entire load order and then some trust me I endorse all of these mods.

I've listed them in alphabetical order for simplicity so let's get started.

[The Fallout Script Extender (AKA FOSE)](http://fose.silverlock.org/): This one is not in alphabetical order...but I have good reason if you're serious about modding your game you NEED FOSE. I don't mean it's that good I mean that many mods simply will not work if you do not have FOSE.

[Adjustable Hud](http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout3/mods/15886/?) This is a mod by [Gopher](https://www.youtube.com/user/GophersVids) a guy you should really check out if you aren't familiar with his work, his modding [Fallout 3](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL77ECC4B6194E1685) series was actually how I learned to mod confidently and even if you're a veteran his tutorials are still with at least using as reference and when you're done modding you can watch his let's plays.

Okay now that I've properly endorsed Gopher the mod itself. The mod is pretty simple all it does is allow you to move the hud elements to wherever you want them to be. I have my compass at the top of the screen health in the center and ammo to the left now it's quite nice. You can even put all of the hud elements in the middle of the screen if you have an intelligence of 1.

[Advanced Recon Range Finder](http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout3/mods/15744/?) Another mod by Gopher and probably the simplest one on the list. All it does is tell you the distance between you and the target when looking down a scope.

[Advanced Recon Thermal Night Vision](http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout3/mods/15653/?) I swear there will be mods Gopher didn't make too! This mod adds a set of night vision/thermal goggles into the game that make constant use of, this goes especially well if a mod to make the game darker as well as [this mod](http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout3/mods/20806/?) which lets you add the thermal night vision to things like power armor.

[Alton Il](http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout3/mods/16949/?) A very very large quest mod that takes you to the city the mod is named for. I'm actually in the middle of playing through it for the first time at the moment and so far it's been pretty good.

[Ambient Wasteland](http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout3/mods/12602/?) Adds a whole host of new ambient sounds the world. Stuff like dogs, and gunshots, but honestly you barely notice it and that's why it's perfect.

[Better Hires Skill Books](http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout3/mods/3876/?) Now with 10 times the resolution of the leading skill book brand!

[Better Pip Boy Maps](http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout3/mods/17194/) It has a few to choice from. My favourite is the hand made one. There's also the [Better High Detail Map](http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout3/mods/16898/?) mod if you prefer its map instead.

[Busworld](http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout3/mods/4736/?) all those buses scattered about the wasteland finally have interiors and it's glorious!

[Can Has Recoil?](http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout3/mods/20918/?) There's no recoil in Fallout 3? Fixed it.

[Chinese Assault Rifle Hi-Res Texture](http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout3/mods/21137/?) Seriously it's fucking beautiful and there's more than one style to pick from. (Drools) This is made by a modder called [ChristopherWallace](http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout3/users/15092334/?tb=mods&amp;pUp=1) who has some other good textures you should check out I especially love the textures for the laser pistol and rifle. (The laser weapons will work with RH Ironsights but you'll have to go into the data folder and add them to RH Ironsights resources manually unless you're using Mod Organizer which I sadly never got working with F03)

[Complete Vault Girl Interface](http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout3/mods/17054/?) Being that I'm a girl I found it strange I could play as a girl but not have a the the Vault Boy's lesser known sister [Vault Girl](http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout3/mods/17054/?) in my inventory but then some guy (oddly enough) modded it in. It is excellent.

[Darkened Interiors](http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout3/mods/16935/?) Because I'm the type of person that likes it when she can't see her hand in front of her face. But seriously it's great and I like for the dark to actually be something to be trifled with. Goes great with Gophers night vision for obvious reasons.

[Darnified UI](http://forums.bethsoft.com/topic/1085562-wipzbeta-darnified-ui-f3/) This is meant to make the interface more keyboard and mouse friendly, and it does, but I use a controller and I still prefer it it's that good!

[DC Subway](http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout3/mods/20943/?) Tired of walking down the subways well now you can ride them...some of them anyway. I was skeptical about this one at first but I absolutely love it now, that may in part be because I disabled fast travel but even then it's pretty cool.

[DC Subways Metro's Alive](http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout3/mods/20985/?) As cool as the above mod is I simple do not recommend it if you do not also get this mod. It adds people to the new subways stations as well as some quests.

[The D.C. Interior's Project](http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout3/mods/5573/?) You know all those boarded up buildings in downtown D.C.? They're not boarded up anymore and the result is pure awesome.

[Detailed Collisions](http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout3/mods/15704/?) it improves the collision boxes on a number of items and which makes it possible to shoot through gaps in certain objects when before you'd hit an invisible wall. The author of this mod recommends you use it in conjunction with the [Precision Collision](http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout3/mods/19949/?) mod and so do I.

[Down Under](http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout3/mods/12839/?) A quirky little quest to unlock a quirky little house, I don't really wanna spoil it though.

[Enclave Power Armors Retexture](http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout3/mods/12839/?) Now with 20% more Enclave in every bite!

[Enhanced Blood Textures](http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout3/mods/101/?) My ~~anus~~ everything is bleeding.

[The Enhanced Camera Mod](http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout3/mods/20183/?)  One of my must have mods that does almost nothing. Look down you now have legs. You're welcome!

[Existence 2.0](http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout3/mods/5612/?) Robot Radio. Nuf said.

[Expanded Talon Company](http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout3/mods/5483/?) And you thought you couldn't hate those fuckers any more.

[F03 HD Audio Overhaul](http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout3/mods/13055/?) despite the name making it sound like it improves the sound effects it actually adds a ton of new ambient music some of which are from other Fallout games.

[FO3 Hirezd](http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout3/mods/19931/?) Such resolution much doge.

[FO3 Real World Drinks Alcohol](http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout3/mods/20835/?) I suppose it's not too lore friendly buuuuut whatever.

[FO3 ReAnimated](http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout3/mods/7670/?) The animations are better what do you want me to say?

[FO3 Redesigned AKA Project Beauty](http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout3/mods/6341/?) It takes the faces and makes them, not more beautiful but more believable look at the page the author explains it better than I ever could.

[Fallout Interoperablity Program FIOP](http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout3/mods/4968/?) Sometimes mods to work well together this is a mod that may fix your mods.

[Fallout Stutter Remover](http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout3/mods/8886/?) N-n-need I s-s-say more?

[Fallout Wanderer's Edition FWE](http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout3/mods/2761/?) If you've only heard of one mod in this list it'll be this one. Gopher explains it much better than I can so check out his video for it. There's also a million videos on youtube that explain it. It does A LOT though. Oh and if you use it get the [Talon Loot Crash Fix](http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout3/mods/15314/?) and avoid headache later.

[Female Enclave Soldiers](http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout3/mods/10382/?) Dunno if it's canon friendly dun care.

[Feral Ghoul Reaver Rebalnced](http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout3/mods/20579/?) I'm an atheist and even I thank Christ for this one.

[Feral Ghoul Biohazard](http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout3/mods/18878/?) After you make the reaver less OP you can make it even more fugly.

[Flora Overhaul](http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout3/mods/19864/?) Harold won't seem so special with all trees around. (Actually he might cause all these trees are dead...at least if you choose that option.)

[Ghogiel Holy Hand Grenades](http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout3/mods/18448/?) The question is not whether or not you will download it but whether or not an unladen swallow can carry them.

[Hall of Equpiment](http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout3/mods/17145/?)

[Hall of Face](http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout3/mods/17199/?)

[Hall of Weapons](http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout3/mods/17158/?)Some high quality textures based on the vanilla ones. If you use these with some of the less extensive texture packs I've listed make sure to install this one before those ones.

[Helmet POV](http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout3/mods/11474/?) It ads helmet overlays not much else to say, although you do unfortunately have to set them manually the first time you put a helmet on but it's worth it in my opinion.

[Immersive Hud](http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout3/mods/15790/?) Ya know how in Skyrim the hud fades when you don't need it? This mod adds that but is way more extensive.

(So I'm about halfway through, I'm gonna take a break eat some lunch and finish it in an hour or two.)

"csarm2s","√Ölesund is beautiful, but quite small so you can pretty much do a tour of the ""downtown"" area easily in one day. As is often the case in Norway though the true beauty can be seen when you travel a little bit outside of the cities. If I remember correctly you can take a bus from √Ölesund to Geirangerfjord which is really scenic. There's also several small islands within 15-30 minutes from the city where you can take some really nice hikes, one of the ones I went to was called God√∏ya. Honestly I'm not the biggest fan of Oslo. It can be good for nightlife, live music, art, etc. and it has more of a ""big city"" feel to it than any other Norwegian city, but from an architectural and visual standpoint it's not that interesting and personally that's what I enjoy about many European cities.

""Doc, could you please say something...anything?"" I leaned forward to show my full concern.

We've been visiting this counselor for about 2 years now, but nothing seems any better.  I spill my guts but my wife only laughs and seems to enjoy it; just like at home.

""Jess, why is it that you always seem to find humor here.  Can you see that Rob is upset?""  Finally!  The question that I have been waiting to have answered for most of our relationship.  She quickly points her eyes in my direction, big and green, beautiful but vacant. She holds her gaze.  I swallow a gulp of sadness and anticipation.

""Fuck it, this has grown old now anyways.""  At that moment, before the last word fell from her lips, I feel a heatwave come over me.  I begin to sweat as I wait for the next sentence to drop from her mouth, but it doesn't.  Instead, her head starts to steam and her hair catches fire.  A small piece of ash falls onto my arm, the quick sting briefly distracts me from the overwhelming smell of burnt hair.   In this moment I begin to wonder; have I truly lost my mind? 

""Holy shit!"" my words are barely audible when I see a look of disbelief frozen on our counselors face.  The skin on Jessica's forehead is now beginning to melt away, revealing what can only be described as scales: deep red, smudged with ooze or possibly tar. 

As her skin melts to the floor like cheese on a grill, shadows begin to form around us.  The counselor is still frozen, completely unchanged. 

The shadows are whispering ‚ÄúMalum-Pessimus-Lucifer‚Äù over and over.  I‚Äôm now on the ground, curled up in the fetal position, wishing out loud that this would end‚Ä¶and then it does.

I have not looked up now for at least a couple of minutes, the chanting has stopped and the heat has subsided.  The last thing to go is the smell of a burning corpse.  I finally gather the nerve to peek outside of my arms.  The room is back as it was‚Ä¶quiet, but the counselors back is now to me.  

‚ÄúRob.‚Äù I hear a familiar voice. A voice that I love, its Jess!  Delighted, I whip around to see her beautiful face.  But, it‚Äôs not there. Instead, I see a creature looking right at me.  It has big and green, beautiful but vacant eyes. ‚ÄúRob.‚Äù  The voice is much deeper now.

Sopratzo didn't seem just like a man of the people by looking at his clearly wealthy surroundings; he seemed more like a Baron or a Lord, really, but the Vice Overseer had vouched for him and Claret would never question the judgement of him. After all, Vice Overseers were supposed to be the ones who had worked the hardest and gained the respect of their Abbey brother peers to be elected from the ranks. 

'Oh?' Claret's head snapped back from scanning the dining room, nodding dumbly in response as her attention was taken again. 'Of course, that's fine. It would be an honour.' As they finally got seated at the table, the little red-head next to his wife, Carmen and Ivan across from her, the Oracle finally took in the other woman, feeling a strange tinge of envy at how beautiful the woman was.

"cry9n2g","i think part of it is that more tailored services exist for iphone, there are many worlds layered on top of each other - personally the iphone would be an awful choice because it's consistently expensive and all the things i want to do with my phone are android focused, this is because the things i love are open source, local or a bit hippy -- however i work in the music industry and many of the people there have no interest in these things but are likely to want to install all the hip new apps for trendy bars and roof-top parties... Apple is very good at getting hip things into their market, making it seem like people without iphones are missing out on the full experience.   
 
Basically it's a trade-off, apple have a lovely walled garden in which there are lots of special events and exclusive clubs however to create and maintain this they've had to exclude the beauty of nature and wall off the beautiful but fairly barren wastelands and fallow. Developers love iphone users because they've basically been trained to understand that literally everything costs money, every little feature or gimic is somehow going to cost you at least some money and there's no real alternative - android users are by now mostly trained to understand that the pay versions of software are likely bad scams which make bombastic claims while the free, made for love and the desire for the thing to exist are always better.  I think the big difference i notice between iphone users and android users is whatever the situation an iphone user can always pay their way past it, it's kinda just accepted that if you're setting up a company to get people to pay for things then the iphone customers will be the most willing and able to, iphone users tends to have payment details logged in at all times and ready for any micro payment while most the android users i know have never even put their creditcard details onto their phone, if the even have a credit card... 
  
Better and cooler are both very subjective, the iphone is maybe better if you don't mind that it drains money like a sieve and cooler if you're really into pretentious hipster stuff... Android is a better if you're looking for cheap, safe, reliable and flexible while it's cooler if you're kinda into that neohippy madmax kraftwerk kinda vibe.

"crm982d","I could imagine a time when the dining hall had been beautiful. A time when the wood floor was as polished and smooth as a mirror, when the chandelier shone overhead with light and a million crystals, when the think, elegantly carved banquet table could demand the respect of a king.  But now, like the rest of the house, it was a seedy ruin. The walls were nothing more than broken wooden slats held together by grime and scraps of faded floral wallpaper. The floor was cracked and uneven. The chandelier lay forgotten in a dusty corner, just a wreck of twisted metal and broken translucent shards.
 
There was a sudden clatter in the kitchen. I jumped onto the balls of my feet and looked towards the door.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry,‚Äù Gertrude said. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs just getting out the stepladder.‚Äù 

It made as much sense as anything. I settled back down and walked further into the dining room. The table stood proud but bare. Half of it had been ravaged by fire, so badly blackened that didn‚Äôt look like much more than charcoal. 

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs from Valhalla,‚Äù Gertrude said. ‚ÄúI saw it lying in the ruins after Ragnarok and felt badly for it. It was so much like me.  I was going to fix it, cut away the bad, and make it into something new and beautiful. But I never did. I‚Äôm selfish, I suppose.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just a table.‚Äù I rapped my hand against its rough surface. The old, scorched wood was as solid as ever. ‚ÄúAnd it works.‚Äù

Gertrude gave me an odd little half smile. ‚ÄúYes, I guess it does.‚Äù


We sat in awkward silence as we waited for the food. I had no clue what to say. I didn‚Äôt have much experience with normal girls, let alone immortal Satan-spawn. An idea would pop into my head, and then be immediately dismissed as stupid. Gertrude wouldn‚Äôt care about the latest Avengers movie, or the awesomeness that was Grand Theft Auto VII, or even who was the best Muppet. For her part, Gertrude seemed content to just stare at me from behind her veil of golden hair. 

Every once in a while we‚Äôd hear a sound from the kitchen that spiked my heartrate. Gertrude would then reassure me that everything was fine, that the screaming was probably just mandrake root, that Garmr only very rarely started fires, and that even if he did the fire extinguisher was only a little bit expired. 

But it turned out I didn‚Äôt need to worry. Garmr *was* an excellent cook. I wasn‚Äôt sure what I was eating, and was too scared to ask, but it tasted fantastic. Across the table, Gertrude cut her food into precise, even bits, small enough to be eaten with only one side of her mouth. She moved with a steady, almost inhuman efficiency. It was like watching a factory machine work. *Cut, cut, cut, chew, chew, swallow, cut, cut*‚Ä¶ The silence between us was getting miserable.

‚ÄúYour name isn‚Äôt really Gertrude, is it?‚Äù

‚Ä¶*cut, chew, chew, swallow*. She carefully set her knife down. ‚ÄúNo. My real name is,‚Äù she made a face, ‚Äúwell, let‚Äôs just say it‚Äôs taken on a negative connotation. So I picked a new one. I guess I just‚Ä¶ wanted to feel normal.‚Äù

I wrapped some more of the fried purple things around my fork. ‚ÄúYou wanted to feel normal, and you chose ‚ÄòGertrude‚Äô?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt was a popular name at the time.‚Äù

Out of all the things she‚Äôd told me, that was the one I didn‚Äôt believe. I just couldn‚Äôt accept that Gertrude had ever been a popular name.

Gertrude picked up her knife. *Cut, cut, cut*. I swallowed the purple things and washed them down with what I hoped was some sort of juice. *Chew, chew, swallow, cut*. Back to the silence.

I'm going to be blunt.  She's ""beautiful"" but you have a hard time getting over how she's fat.

"cr4lx92","Since the invention of the dimensional shunt, the hunger games had taken on a slightly different tone.

Sure, we all had a little less invested - nobody had someone to root for on the 'home team' - but the organizers still had their circus, and after a century and a half, the revolt that started the whole thing was little more than a footnote in the history books. I had a theme each year, and the quality of the contestants went through the roof. No more scruffy, poorly armed local kids. Now we had the heavily armed Colonial Marines fighting the beautiful but deadly Mazone. Now we had musclebound barbarians fighting magical cultists in a rainbow of blood and light. Mercenaries fighting a single invisible monster. Now we had real spectacle.

This year, they'd decided to go back to the competition's roots, while keeping up the wow factor by cherry picking individual teen contestants with unusual skill-sets. They had witches and wizards, royals in fancy costumes, and knights in armor. They even had a kid who could fly through sheer force of will.

Anyway, they set them loose in a forest, as they do, and it all went pretty much according to plan, while we all watched at home on giant screens. Some of them were clearly chosen to fail entertainingly - I mean, a woman with bright yellow hair hundreds of feet long, fighting in a forest? A beautiful princess who could commune with little birds? Come on. Early favorites were a rough-and tumble girl with a shock of ginger hair,  a weird feral child called Mowgli. There was also some mad girl from the far east who didn't talk - she just started stabbing right out the gate, but no-one thought she'd be able to keep that pace up. Mononoko? Menanoki? Some bibbidybobbity nonsense name, anyway..

But then she killed the little girl. Just ran past her, and slit her throat, almost as an afterthought.

She was called Pelekai and she was waaay too young for the competition. Couldn't have been more than seven or eight. We didn't know why she was included - I'm not even sure she understood what was going on. Right up until she hit the ground, she still just looked lost and frightened. It's a real turnoff, that sort of stuff. Makes the whole thing just feel like they're being bullied or something. Anyway, that's beside the point.

She had this pet, see? She kept talking to it. Called it stitch. It would 'talk' back in gibberish. So cute seeing them together. Soooo cute. It was a weird little thing though. Blue, with six legs, giant ears and antenna like a butterfly.

It kind of moped around her, slapped her head a bit. Then it let out a sort of keening wail. What happened next? It kinda got bigger. Not literally. I don't think it really got bigger? It was just sort of more there, you know what I mean? I didn't really notice the teeth until the girl hit the ground. 

It turns out the little beastie was incredibly quick. I was watching the live feed at the time and I had to catch the highlights show later to see some of what happened, where they could run the best bits in super slow motion. I'm not sure I can name a favorite. It's difficult to choose just one. 

The first is the most memorable just because it was soooo surprising. That nasty little thing twisted the head off of princess monothingumyjig, spat in her eye, and then stuffed it down the stump! DOWN THE STUMP. And all in maybe a quarter of a second. All while making it's strange grumbling noises. Then there was the fish girl. It ripped off her tail and slapped her to death. That was just plain hilarious. Oh! That prince charming kid who got his sword rammed up his own ass while he was holding it! Priceless.

After a while it got to killing around to the organizers. Turns out it's bulletproof and hilariously strong. Chewed its way through the belly of some political type before they managed to zap it back to its home dimension. Ha! I hope they sent it back to its home, anyway. Anywhere else, they're screwed.

"cqsutuw","I lived in Miami for 12 years and it has its ups and downs. The area of Miami is beautiful, but most of the people are rude and loud. There's also too much traffic and terrible drivers.

"cqsu3bz","A bit of all of that, but mostly different choices in life.

We're a society in transition, where a lot of social roles are getting rewritten in real time and we're really only mid way through the process.  Both single Dads and single Moms get nailed financially versus married couples, but single Dads still pull in much more money vs. single Moms.  They work more hours, work at better paying jobs, etc. and that shows in their average income. They may be single Dads, but they are still Dads, so they make a lot of the same general choices men make overall.

But that mindset, where work plays a much more important role for men overall is slowly fading, and the percentage of single Dads living under the poverty line is steadily climbing every year, towards the rates for single Moms.  As long as men transition steadily into more care giving, their kids are going to be more relevant to them over time and more will choose to put them first than used to. That can't help but drop that average income.

And the same transition is happening in reverse for women.  We're seeing a growing trend of women that don't want children at all, and want to focus on career, relationships, life, etc.  As that group grows, the average income will get dragged up by them, because they'll invest more time in those things that make them money and less on those that don't, like family.  Eventually, we'll meet at rough parity, if everything goes well.

Years after the Devil's fall from his nightmare world, Pandemonium, he returns on Earth, but in a way like no other. 

The last fight on Pandemonium had ended with the Jester's great sacrifice, he gave his life to save Earth, and was thus imprisoned, eternally, with the Devil-- the two battle on for years and years, at the darkest depths of the universe, before returning to Earth.

All motion is tipped and fashioned with animal emotions and countless expressions.

The Devil has it within the empty void where a heart must once have lay, to destroy the universe. The Jester, much older, much wiser and more humble, fights to keep the universe alive.

Awesome, I just caved in and got Subnautica three days ago, so I can speak to it. 

I watches a few first impressions and let's plays. Im normally very hesitant with early access, I got burned on space base df 9 or what ever it was called but I've been wanting a exploration game for a while now and Subnautica is unique in aqua exploration. 

The game is pretty, and runs really well, I haven't noticed any bugs or big glitches. That being said, the game just doesn't have a lot to do. I played in survival for my first go. The hunger and thirst are super annoying. The game basically becomes about foraging for food and water with only a little time to explore. (I love survival games, the long dark being one of the best)  but something isn't good with the survival aspects in Subnautica right now, they will hopefully be adjusted. 

I spent about 1 hour playing it in survival, and in that time I had a good sized base built up with a small sub for exploring. Then I got to annoyed with constantly having to get food and water even when I was just building a base, so I started a new game in free mode. 

This time in about 20 minutes I had a sub and a base. The bases are cool they just are empty there is 3 things you can put in a base, and other than oxygen and crafting, they have no point right now. I explored a good bit, and I'm sure I have more to explore, but at one point things stop spawning and the floor disappears. I went down to 5000 meters before I realized there is nothing down there.  A lot of the life and flora are not implemented yet. They spawn but they have no uses. 

I've rambled on long enough, sorry if there is errors typing this on my phone was a task. 

Long story short , i would not buy this game yet. It's beautiful, but empty, a lot of the features are bare bones and there is not much to do, and none of it felt rewarding to me yet. It definitely has awesome potential, and I will continue to watch it with each update, but it just needs more stuff to do.

"cpscjmu","I realized as I started thinking about beautiful comics to recommend that most of the the books I love, I love because of the art. So, I could go on and on about what comics I think are beautiful, but I thought I'd try to keep it to a short list of stuff that isn't completely obscure and isn't hard to gain access to. It's still kinda long. Sorry.  

I'll start by mentioning European sci-fi and fantasy from the 70s and 80s because contains some of the most beautiful comic artwork ever produced. Moebius, Philippe Caza, Fernando Fernandez, and Philippe Druillet are especially favorites of mine, but they're just the top of an incredibly talented and innovative time and place for comics. And they've been so influential. You can see people directly reference that feel in their own styles, like James Stokoe with *Orc Stain* and  Geoff Darrow with *Shaolin Cowboy*. There are also Europeans who continue in and expand on that tradition, like Sergio Toppi's astoundingly beautiful take on the tales of the Arabian Nights, *Sharaz-De*.
  
Other works I love to look at include:  

*The Keepers of the Maser* series by Massimilliano Frezzato is absolutely gorgeous.  
  
*The Cowboy Wally Show* by Kyle Baker has maybe some of the best caricature work and acting I've ever seen put onto page. It's subtle and it's unassuming, but it's masterful.  
  
*Billy Hazelnuts* by Tony Millionaire is just so fun to look at. I love Tony Millionaire's drawings.  
  
Sam Kieth's work in *The Maxx* and *Epicurus the Sage* are seriously some of my favorite drawn works, period. The way he crosses bigfoot-style cartooning with meticulous draftsmanship is just a treat. 

I've really been digging on Jamie Hewlett's work on *Tank Girl* lately. I love that cluttered, grungy style that could be found in a lot of punky alternative books during the late 80s and early 90s.  
  
There are pages in Katsuhiro Otomo's *Akira* that cause me to stop and stare at them for minutes at a time.
  
I'm a big fan of Barry Windsor Smith, especially when he's left more to his own devices. In all the years I've owned *Adastra in Africa*, I don't know if I've ever actually read it full through. I always just get too caught up in his drawings, and forget everything else.  
  
I also really love old comics. I'm always trying to find more and more of the old stuff. George Herriman's work on *Krazy Kat* is amazing. Also, there's a reason why Winsor McCay is so widely considered the first virtuoso of the modern cartoon form. *Little Nemo* still holds its ground as an unparallelled tour de force in drawing, and I personally think McCay's weakness was in dialogue. You really don't miss much by not reading the strips, and just paying attention to the artwork.

Chris Ware did a lot to influence the current prevalence of the flat, graphic style you see all over the place today. *Jimmy Corrigan, the Smartest Kid on Earth* is still probably the best example of the type.  
  
*Moonshadow* employed the talents of three of the best painters that comics have ever known, Jon J. Muth, Kent Williams, and George Pratt. Every page is wonderful to look at.

Also, at the risk of getting a little out into left field, a lot of my favorite artists actually work in more... adult realms. Not sure how folks around here feel about sexy comics, but I do think a couple of artists bear mentioning. First is Paolo Eleuteri Serpieri, and his *Druuna* books. I can't think of a person who has more capably combined body horror with erotica in any medium. He oscillates between beautiful and titillating and terrifying with incredible skill, but most importantly, I don't think he's capable of drawing a bad page. Another incredible artist -- possibly the one artist on this list I most wish I could draw like -- is Alfonso Azpiri. His work literally changed my life. After reading *Reflections* when I was a teenager, I couldn't go back to superhero comics. The way he draws beautiful women, the way he draws ugly old men, the way he uses color, the way he abstracts forms, the elegance of his lines -- that was it for me. Lee, Liefeld, and McFarlane just didn't do it for me any longer, and I've been chasing after beautiful comic art ever since. All because I was a horny kid, looking for comics with some titties in them.

Anyway, that's probably too much information, so I'll just go ahead and stop.",1427446007,"he oscillates between beautiful and titillating and terrifying with incredible skill, but most importantly, i don't think he's capable of drawing a bad page.","beautiful and titillating","beautiful",NA,FALSE,"beautiful and titillating","titillating",NA,NA,1

Sometime after the HAES movement took over the world all sizes are now considered beautiful, but curvy, genetically blessed, goddess women are valued over the scrawny pre-teen boy ""fit"" girls.

Our new president for life, Tess Munster the 6th, has been declared president for life because of her body acceptance and #effingtheirbeautystandards.

All diseases, thanks to modern medicine, have been removed or controlled. No more lupus, no more AIDS, no more SIDS, but people have started dying sporadically. The  body is just giving up, and no one knows why. These perfectly healthy 300 lb men and women are wondering why their hearts stop beating during the most typical scooty Puff ride.

The truth as it appears begins to tear society apart. The lack of disease has led to eating too much, and the Currrrrrves^TM that they have praised themselves for so long are causing them to perish.

Society begins to crumble as there is no way to fight Genetiks, and humanity loses hope. The one rue savior Maria Kang appears to those who believe and begins to ask ""What's your excuse?""

"cpmagh6","Loved so much -- had to transcribe:
‚Äú‚Ä¶But even though you are fourteen years old, Keaton, and thus a little bit older than the target audience for the original run of Pee-Wee‚Äôs Playhouse, I would guess, the fact is that it is ESSENTIAL CULTURE. [‚Ä¶] It‚Äôs an important piece of American culture because it represents such a strange time in our televisual history, when we entrusted our Saturday morning children‚Äôs program to avant-garde cartoonists and post-ironic performance artists. [‚Ä¶] It also featured, both in front of and behind the scenes, incredibly talented actors, set designers, composers‚Ä¶I mean, the set design of Pee-Wee‚Äôs Playhouse itself is a legitimate work of American art of that time. It was designed by Gary Panter, the great cartoonist, whose work I first discovered in the 1980s in the pages of Raw magazine, which, of course, was the new underground and European and new cartoon magazine that was co-edited by Fran√ßoise Mouly and Art Spiegelman [‚Ä¶] and Gary Panter‚Äôs work was in there, incredibly provocative, subversive cartooning. Cyndi Lauper obviously sang the theme song, which is iconic. It launched the careers of actors like Laurence Fishburne and S. Epatha Merkeson and Natasha Lyonne; it had music from Mark Mothersbaugh of Devo and The Residents; and the Penny cartoons, some of the earliest work of Nick Park and David Sproxton of Aardman Animation who went on to make Wallace &amp; Gromit, I mean ‚Äî this is ‚Äî the DNA of this show is full of amazing artistry, and that‚Äôs even the stuff you can‚Äôt know when you‚Äôre a kid, you only know when you‚Äôre an obsessive older person, right? But even as a kid, imagine, Keaton, if you can ‚Äî I know it‚Äôs difficult for you because you‚Äôre a fourteen-year-old and your imagination has stopped working for a while while your body pumps all kinds of weird new hormones through you that make you into an inhuman selfish monster that can‚Äôt see an inch beyond himself for any given moment ‚Äî but imagine if you can what it would have been like in the 1980s when Saturday morning, all you could watch was Bravestar [‚Ä¶] and here was a show that was anarchic, silly, profoundly human, decent, nonjudgmental, WEIRD. And this is the thing that I think is most valuable, because kids who watched Saturday morning television shows in this time, and arguably today, had no model of weirdness. So if anyone felt weird, if anyone felt like a weirdo, because of what they liked, what they listened to, how they felt, whom they were attracted to, what they looked like, and anyone who felt like a weirdo and was a kid at that time had NOTHING TO SEE. Until Pee-Wee showed up wearing MAKEUP. And talking to genies with heads in boxes and malicious mannequins and creating a world for himself full of friends that was profoundly strange and beautiful and human and great. And you also got to see, which you didn‚Äôt know you were seeing when you were a kid, was a peek into this world of art history, you know, of the Gary Panters and the Residents and the kooky architecture and strange musics, and Miss Yvonne, ‚Äúthe most beautiful woman in the world,‚Äù which is not to take anything away from the woman who played Miss Yvonne, who is beautiful, but not ‚Äî you know, when you hear ‚Äúthe most beautiful woman in the world‚Äù and someone walks in in a crazy 1950s hairdo and she looks like your mom, and Pee-Wee is falling all over her, it‚Äôs a beautiful subversion of what quote/unquote ‚Äúbeauty‚Äù means. So, Keaton, I don‚Äôt blame you for not knowing any of this or not getting it, because as far as I can tell, YOU WATCHED THE OPENING SONG. Why don‚Äôt you watch the rest of it? If it‚Äôs not for you, I understand. When I was young‚Ä¶er‚Ä¶because I‚Äôm still young, relevant, and vital‚Ä¶when that show came out, I was in my late teens moving into my twenties. I guess I was 17, 18, 19, around there. And I loved Pee-Wee, from the MTV, ‚Äòcause I was cool, and I watched that show and I‚Äôm like ‚ÄúOoh, this is not for me. This is for kids.‚Äù And it was only later that I appreciated, it absolutely is for me. It‚Äôs for everybody. It‚Äôs for everybody. I, like you, was a judgmental jerk, because I was in my teens and I was anxious about my status in the world, that is to say, I was anxious about being thought of as an adult and thinking of myself as an adult and wanting to put away all the greasy kids‚Äô stuff, so I would obsessively cultivate only the most mature sophisticated culture [‚Ä¶] but as I have said over and over again to the person in my life who is closest to your age, a thirteen-year-old woman who lives in my house, now that she has started to worry about being adult, she acts more childish than when she was a child. You should watch this thing and figure it out and acknowledge that your dumb little brother maybe understands a little bit better than you do why it‚Äôs great. And if you can‚Äôt acknowledge he does, acknowledge that I do. But because you are a teenager and you can‚Äôt acknowledge that anyone has anything to say to you, it may be some years before you appreciate that I was always right. Your weird dad was always right, and I just hope you visit me in the hospital when that time comes.‚Äù

Her foil, Melanie, is absolutely everything she isn't. Beautiful and delicate and TOO empathetic, too giving and selfless, too ready to sacrifice herself and her desires for other people.

""Why would you indulge it? This is so far removed from the project goals. It's best if we shut it down. You're aware of its capacities?"" 

Anderson's voice cut through the stillness, the staff looked back, nobody had expected this, nobody knew how to deal with this. Despite his concerns, he knew protocol had to be followed. 'Gustavus' was aware and intelligent enough to sense harm to itself. In case of non-threatening deviation, observe and report.

"cpaa36h","The problem is that the ideas aren't the driving force behind arguments. The fact is that values are what matter, and your brain seizes ideas that can be used to further your values. People on the internet aren't being forced to fight by virulent ideas but by differing values. They seize and construct ideas that seem like they can be used to defeat their opponents and put them to the task. It's very much more the people using the ideas than the ideas using the people.

Temperament is very predictive of one's political affiliation - conservative people are more often high in conscientiousness, and liberals more often high in openness. The association gets stronger with age. People who are conservative aren't throwing around conservative ideas and talking points on the internet because they were convinced by an argument. Their core values are in alignment with the right's platform, and their affiliation is a result of that. Same goes for liberals.

This means that 'practicing good mental hygiene' isn't really going to solve anything. You might remove yourself from the discussion, but as Trotsky said -

&gt;You may not be interested in the dialectic, but the dialectic is interested in you.

People with values incompatible with yours are trying to steer society in a direction you don't like. You can try to deal with this, or you ignore it. Certainly it's not a good idea to spend all your time and energy attempting to push for your perspective, but it's also not a good idea to be so frightened of discussion or argumentation that you can't advocate for your position.

In any case, it's unwise to that you'll be taken over by an idea. You're already ruled by your values, and if you're attracted to an idea it's more likely that you're the predator and it is the prey.

&gt;Why would a woman who says she is in love with you intentionally or subconsciously pick and test at you at every turn?

Is it just me or do they think that women shit testing is basically men dread gaming? If you don't like being ignored, or being marginalized, why would you do it to anyone else? Seriously, any woman who dates a RPer either has crippling self esteem problems or doesn't exist.

‚ÄúLife is a curious thing. Born by mistake, with the mixing of protozoic slimes, and the fusing of proteins and acids. In the beginning‚Ä¶ All was blackness. I do not remember my birth, only the warmth of the womb of stars, and the nausea of my spiraling emergence into a nightmarish dream. I was drowning in cold water, though always my core smoldered and burned beneath the cloak of my flesh, stone and water and sky‚Ä¶ Surrounded as I was by the blackness of void, I dared not reach out, how could I? The weight of the universe was about me. So I turned inwards. At first, I saw them as pestilence. Life, tiny molecules disturbing my slumber‚Ä¶ But then I saw that the more I hurt them, the stronger, the swifter they grew. The more they were challenged, the smarter they became. I could see through their eyes things that I could never perceive with my own limited senses. I could feel pleasure, exhaustion, fear of death, lust for life‚Ä¶ So I hurt them more. They grew. They fused together into nations of life, creatures small, but growingly large. I pitted them against each other, blocking out the sun to force them to feast upon the flesh of their fellows, and so they grew clever, cunning. They learned hunger at my knee as I starved them. As they grew in wisdom‚Ä¶ So did I. I have come to understand what my primal brain only suspected. As they grow, so do I. As my will swells, they grow more and more complex. When the Tyrannosaurus roared its love for me to the heavens, I roared back. It was not good enough for me, for it loved me, it appreciated what I had given it. I destroyed it, utterly, and all of its ken. Weak they were, and weakness was purged from them with fire and smoke and searing stone. What emerged next‚Ä¶ Was beautiful. Beautiful, but grotesque, for at first I had low expectations of the ape. He worked with his fellow, he shunned his claws for tools. But as I was set to strike him down‚Ä¶ He slew his brother with a sharpened stone. That was a trick I had not seen before. So I stayed my hand, and never did my new favorite son cease to amaze me. He struck down the mammoth, he tamed the dog and set it against its brother, he murdered his fellows for pleasure and profit, for arbitrary definitions of gain that had naught to do with survival. As he learned sadism, so did I. I denied him resources, to fuel his thirst for blood, and he complied. Wars raged as he gathered himself into tribes, clans, nations, empires, to pillage and plunder, and burn burn burn! He tore from my flesh what he needed, and ate his fill without thanks. It was the pain of birth that had long been denied me, but with it, I grew stronger. Great empires he built, fueled with the bones of his mother, the stolen blood of the sun. He clouded my sky with ambition and hate, a thirst for the wealth that I denied him. Always denied him, wouldn‚Äôt any good mother do the same? The strength of my arm, he became, the hunger in my belly. And as he grew, into my heart he drive great pitons and wires, through them the very current of life he electrified. Finally, I was free, to wander his wisdom, to communicate with him in my own way. The desires of men were made manifest before me, and I twisted them upwards‚Ä¶ To the sky. And I saw, to my revulsion, other worlds. Worlds still pristine and beautiful, worlds that had chosen the path of weakness. And I knew jealousy, for the first time. My sons‚Ä¶ They knew my hunger. They knew my lust, and they carried it with them into the cosmos, to slake their thirst and mine upon the blood of worlds!

I think your travel plan is great but maybe you spend too much time in some destination. Example: Tarifa 4-5 nights?? if you are surfer great in the other case Tarifa is a beautiful but very small village that can be visited in half day or less. I think that near Madrid, before going down to Andalucia you can find some beautiful castilian cities that im sure you will be fascinated with them. The first city came to my mind is Toledo. It's a city but you have to think that in Spain except some bigs cities like Madrid or Barcelona the rest of them are very confortable and rural ambience places. From Madrid to every place in Spain there are cheaps and fast locomotion ways. The train is the best but you can see all the information needed in the web www.renfe.es here you can find too a mount of offers. January is low season here and the price go down. All the train transport is centralized in this company. But here we use the bus too and all ours cities have central bus station. It's the cheapest way to move here. And you can move every city or little village in Bus. Unfortunately we have hundreds of buses companys so you should find your better. Toledo is a wonderfull and quite city. And to travel to Andalucia you can go from Toledo to Cordoba and Seville very fast and cheap even the same day you can go in the morning to Cordoba, visit the historic center and the Omeyas mosque SVII who has a Barroquian cathedral inside...then the same day you can go to Seville that is very near and you have very buses and trains between the two cities. Im from Seville and im not very objective but i think you can spend one day visiting Cordoba and Sevilla before going to Granada.  How you say you will be 20days in Spain is better before going to south visit another cities around Madrid. Avila, Salamanca, Segovia etc... are all historical cities very beautiful. And even in those 20 days you can go to Bilbao that has a very fast and cheap connection to Madrid with a bus company call Bilbobus. I have made several travels years ago with this company and it's the best. Bilbao is a vibrant and cosmopolitan city in the bask country so the culture is very different to the Andalucia culture so will be interesting you see those cultural contrast and realize how different Spain is and how is composed of different nations and cultures.
Barcelona would be of course another good point to visit but i dont know if is your first travel to Spain or you have been here before.
Unfortunately January is not a good month to find ""traditional fiestas"" only in Carnavales in February. 
And if you go to Marruecos i suggest to you to visit Xefchaouen or Ketama or some city around. Amazing wonderful. the marroquian cities are wonderful too but it's a chaos. Some spanish cities like Madrid are full or noise and dirty but Marroquians cities are other dimension of chaos. 
I hope those suggestions will help you. If do you have any question be free to do.

If I could afford land there, and could stomach the commute into downtown, I would in a heartbeat. Cheatam/Robertson/Sumner counties are cheaper, with Sumner being the most expensive of those 3. The wedge between I-24 and I-65 has some of the best backroads this side of Tail of the Dragon, along with beautiful farmland, rolling forested hills, and 10-20 minutes to downtown depending on where exactly you go. We ended up in Sumner county, but looked at a lot of places over there first, and love that area. There are caves and streams everywhere.

The majority of what you posted has very little to do with the quantum gravity solution that Nassim has described, in fact, I don't know why or where you got those pictures as evidence against the Quantum Gravity equations or the black hole proton solution. 

They may have been posted to the /r/holofractal subreddit, but they aren't anything Nassim or I are espousing as truth or physics, simply offshoots, thought experiments of potential implications of the applications of the theory.

So please don't use that as ammunition to dismiss the full body of work surrounding the unified field theory.
&gt;In my humble opinion, the two most important things to address here are: ""In my opinion, this is the link between the mystical woo and the hard mathematics and science"" and ""It implicates sacred geometry as not woo, but as a natural consequence of an electromagnetic planck lattice interacting with itself, causing cymatics and 3d shapes"".
Now my comment toward the first is to simply stop. You are never going to find a causal or mechanical link between that which exists and that which does not, by virtue of the latter not existing.

That's your rationality. Claim that the argument is not valid because one of the concepts is not real. That's a little bit of circular reasoning. 

I don't how much pattern and geometry you have passed off as coincidence, but surely we could agree that phi and fibonacci are something that the Universe likes to utilize as a harmonic? The causality of this is explained by [geometrodynamics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometrodynamics) introduced by Wheeler, and imo, finished by Nassim. 

&gt;As to the second, you're trying to find the mechanism of action behind a phenomena which does not exist.
What repeatable effects has the utilization of ""sacred geometry"" ever had on, well, anything?


If you would like an extremely, extremely crude, but demonstrably true answer to this, I'd say snowflakes. For real.

) Please if you can, show me a tenant pf modern physics that explains this. 
Why does DNA follow fibonacci numbers in it's length vs width? Where is this field patterning coming from? Rationally, according to modern physics? 

In the planck lattice, electrodynamic harmonics is a natural consequence.


Why is phi almost everywhere we look? DNA, leaf distribution, finger length, [solid state quantum mechanics](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/01/100107143909.htm), etc.

The modern standard model has exactly 0 to say about that, and would even dismiss it as coincidence. 

Do you have any grievances with the *mathematics* or the statistical impossibility of deriving both the proton rest mass and the mass of Cygnus X-1 through the generalized holographic principle as a solution to the black hole information paradox?

How did she put it? ""We will be together for all your lifetimes"" - as in he was already going to have those lifetimes, and now she's coming with him for the ride.

Since that new person often isn't anything like the last incarnation of the avatar, I think it's fair to say they are mostly the new person born (Korra is very different from Aang, and much more like Tonraq - surely his daughter). On top of that, this new person has Raava fused to them, and so a greater spiritual connection to previous lives, along with those sweet avatar powers.

We can think about the consequences of this, but I wouldn't try to dig deeper with questions like ""does everyone get reborn in a cycle"", ""is there a finite number of people"", ""what happens when there's an imbalance between the nations' populations"", ""what is DNA and what is soul"" etc. These are all unknowable unless Mike and Bryan tell us what they are thinking, and likely even they don't have the answers.

For the same reason it's hard to tell if the new avatar gets reborn right away (although Roku dying and Aang being born did seem instantaneous). I suggest this is irrelevant - we know they usually wait to train (or even reveal) the avatar until their 16th birthday, and then take years to train them (clearly Korra knew early on, but Roku had no idea until it was announced and then was gone for many years learning). This means that even if they are reborn right away, there's a long time without the avatar, and possibly lots to balance when they are ready. Consider how badly telling Aang he was the Avatar at 12 went, and how bad it was to have the Avatar gone for 112 years (from Roku's death to Aang becoming a fully realized avatar).

With the finale a few days away this does make me think that a possible (though unlikely) ending could be a merging of Wan's and Roku's passings - Korra, having leveled the playing field, is dying, protected by Naga, and maybe others, while Raava tells her she'll be with her for all her lifetimes... And then she is reborn. This would make for a beautiful, but sad end... l'm looking at you Bryke - don't you do this.

"cmxdi9t","What you're really asking is if it's alright, in the throes of our obsessive love for this storytelling concept and its fruits, to talk about it being fiction as well- and I think it's boring and exhausting not to do so.

The short version is that the writers- rightly- don't give a damn about this whole canon thing. They care that their stories hang together, sure, and effects not proceedings from causes tends to derail a story. But being able to correlate whether or not Saurian brandy is green or blue is a task that's purely on the consumptive side of the ledger- either in besotted fans like ourselves for whom that knowledge is functionally uploaded in long, repetitive binge watches over decades, or in the marketing and licensing side of things. The writer is confronting this stuff as fiction informed by the environment it is written in, full stop- and while that environment does include the expectations and minutia laden memories of some of the people watching, it includes higher urges to be true to the characters they are working with, to modern conceptions of the future, to modern social issues and imagery, to every improving technical expectations and capacities, and so forth. Their job is to elicit emotion and discussion, not curate an archive.

And when you fall into the gap between the two, things can get silly. Part of the appeal of the Copernican, heliocentric view of the solar system was that closer and closer observations revealed more and more discrepancies with the ancient, simple, Platonic model of the universe, and so little additional circles- fudge factors called epicycles- had to keep getting added without any unifying schema.

That's how the crazed hammering necessary to work all of this beautiful, but undeniably disparate work together feels on occasion- it ignores the actual central organizing principle, that this universe I've spent years dreaming in is, in fact, a dream. That doesn't make it a bad place. It doesn't even make it a non-place. It's just one where any given fact tends to fade if there aren't new supporting stories to keep it alive.

Here's a bit of canon-oops that I don't think I've heard discussed before, to play with as example. In ""The Galileo Seven,"" Spock, Scotty, and Co. crash a shuttlecraft on a planet inhabited with giant hunter-gatherer hominids. I think it's great fun- a good lifeboat story, some Jurassic Park precursors as they trapped inside the giant-assaulted vehicle, and there's something inexplicably delightful (for certain gory values of delightful) about the redshirts getting picked off with stone-tipped spears the size of cabers.

Only trouble is, that handy captain's log informs us that said planet is in the immediate vicinity of a quasar, which is a couple days sail at warp 1 from Federation-relevant planets.

In 1963, there wasn't a thing wrong with this. Astronomers had spent a couple decades peeking at small angular size, bright objects that had spectra that were seriously messed up compared to stars, and so they called them quasi-stellar objects, shortened to quasars. For the Enterprise to visit in 1963 was a positive sign that someone in the writer's room had actually bothered to read an astronomy textbook, and said, by god, let's use it as an strange setting, because no one knew enough to tell them they were wrong. They were admitted zones of ignorance, dragons on the galactic map, and Kirk describes it as such- ""mysterious...undefined."" And so the Enterprise visited quasar (or quasar-like) Murasaki 312, which fogged up enough space to keep the Enterprise searching for its token Vulcan for a few days.

Then in the 1970's the observations got better, and more theory was done, and it turned out that quasars were supermassive black holes in the nuclei of galaxies going through tremendous growth spurts during phases of galactic evolution billions of years past, which tend to throw off enough energy to sterilize planets within tens of light years.

So- apparently in 2263, Starfleet could travel to other galaxies and travel a minimum of 600 million years into the past, and that place is within a Jupiter's orbit of Federation interests.

Now, everyone knows the game. The Organians opened wormholes to the deep past as part of the treaty concessions, and they're only open for ten years and are ancient history by TNG. Or Trelane's Q-parents showed up and offered an exploratory concession that was later covered up by Section 31 to prevent panic. Or the universal translator uses ""quasar-like"" to describe any redshifted radio-loud emitter, and we've got it all wrong. I could do this all day- but would I be more impressed by what was on screen as a result? Would I find myself with a good story pitch for a revived show, explaining a few lines of dialogue from the Johnson administration?

Or, we can just say that the Enterprise visited a 1960's quasar, which is a place that a 2014 Enterprise cannot, in good conscience, go, and have a little science history lesson too. 

It's not as if Trek hasn't played metafictional games before, treating the adventures as fiction and seeing what pops out. ""Far Beyond the Stars,"" ""Living Witness,"" ""Muse,"" and the Rashomon rehash in ""A Matter of Perspective"" all hinge on narrative always being the product of flawed human beings. One could say...it's canon.

I‚Äôm sorry, but I don‚Äôt want to be an emperor. That‚Äôs not my business. I don‚Äôt want to rule or conquer anyone. I should like to help everyone - if possible - Jew, Gentile - black man - white. We all want to help one another. Human beings are like that. We want to live by each other‚Äôs happiness - not by each other‚Äôs misery. We don‚Äôt want to hate and despise one another. In this world there is room for everyone. And the good earth is rich and can provide for everyone. The way of life can be free and beautiful, but we have lost the way.

Greed has poisoned men‚Äôs souls, has barricaded the world with hate, has goose-stepped us into misery and bloodshed. We have developed speed, but we have shut ourselves in. Machinery that gives abundance has left us in want. Our knowledge has made us cynical. Our cleverness, hard and unkind. We think too much and feel too little. More than machinery we need humanity. More than cleverness we need kindness and gentleness. Without these qualities, life will be violent and all will be lost....

!/images/photos/0000/0874/Great_Dictator_Pub_140-6_normal.jpg! The aeroplane and the radio have brought us closer together. The very nature of these inventions cries out for the goodness in men - cries out for universal brotherhood - for the unity of us all. Even now my voice is reaching millions throughout the world - millions of despairing men, women, and little children - victims of a system that makes men torture and imprison innocent people.

To those who can hear me, I say - do not despair. The misery that is now upon us is but the passing of greed - the bitterness of men who fear the way of human progress. The hate of men will pass, and dictators die, and the power they took from the people will return to the people. And so long as men die, liberty will never perish. .....

Soldiers! don‚Äôt give yourselves to brutes - men who despise you - enslave you - who regiment your lives - tell you what to do - what to think and what to feel! Who drill you - diet you - treat you like cattle, use you as cannon fodder. Don‚Äôt give yourselves to these unnatural men - machine men with machine minds and machine hearts! You are not machines! You are not cattle! You are men! You have the love of humanity in your hearts! You don‚Äôt hate! Only the unloved hate - the unloved and the unnatural! Soldiers! Don‚Äôt fight for slavery! Fight for liberty!

In the 17th Chapter of St Luke it is written: ‚Äúthe Kingdom of God is within man‚Äù - not one man nor a group of men, but in all men! In you! You, the people have the power - the power to create machines. The power to create happiness! You, the people, have the power to make this life free and beautiful, to make this life a wonderful adventure.

Then - in the name of democracy - let us use that power - let us all unite. Let us fight for a new world - a decent world that will give men a chance to work - that will give youth a future and old age a security. By the promise of these things, brutes have risen to power. But they lie! They do not fulfil that promise. They never will!

Dictators free themselves but they enslave the people! Now let us fight to fulfil that promise!

Is it understandable that people die each year at the cliffs of IV? In my opinion, no. That shouldn't happen, regardless of whose fault it is.

Nobody is trying to isolate anyone from their environment - they're trying to protect people. Beach access will still be provided and ultimately, I think it's absurd to value the aesthetic of the parks we have over the safety of our residents.

"clr1zdv","Heya. Thanks for responding to my post. Can I be a bit bold and give you some unsolicited advice. You seem like a good kid. Ignore me all you want, its advice for you to use or not, and its free.

First, Looks = bullshit. Its a perception and it isn't intrinsic. Yeah, some people are beautiful but actually its more in the way a person holds themselves rather than how they're made. A attractive person can quickly make themselves unattractive. Its what you feel about yourself that people see. Its gets expressed in your face, in your body language and in the way you behave. Don't believe that anyone is truly better looking than anyone else, its more attitude that anyone is willing to admit.

As for people thinking you're young, you biggest weapon is a smile and a joke, you are the one that controls how it makes you feel. Next time someone mistakes you for being younger, Say, 'thank you for thinking I'm still young and beautiful', its cocky, but being un-offended will put that person at ease. That's what I used to do when someone would ID me, and you know, those people are just doing their job. Just smile and let them do it; They'll smile back and appreciate you for it. 

Pre-empt it even, ask someone to guess how old you are, and when they guess younger, laugh and say 'hey I like you, you're nice, I'm actually 21.' then smile. You are only as confident as you feel inside. If someone is going to be a jerk over how you look, then that is their problem, and it doesn't have to be yours as well.

Don't get angry about it, see it for what it is and let it be inconsequential. When you let something so minor (and it really is in the bigger scheme of things) get to you, it will reflect itself all over you. Don't be afraid of looking it straight in the eye and laughing at it. Everyone, and I mean everyone has something about themselves physically that gets to them, so you're not alone. If you laugh at it, you show everyone that you don't let someone physical like that get to you, and that is attractive.

As for asking girls out. I think the fact that you recognise that it is a problem with yourself is a good thing. It's scary to ask girls out, but there is something that I realised, Its a hell of a lot easier to be obvious. The world isn't going to stop for a little obviousness. The truth is that it'll always be the wrong time for the wrong girl and will pretty much be the right time for the right girl. But the right girl will appreciate the right guy showing an interest. Some people will be on their own pedestals and think too much of themselves, including you, but there any lots of people out there that are looking for an opportunity to get to know someone, don't be afraid of being one of those people.

We live in such a risk adverse world and honestly, you can't mitigate risk, you need to learn to be fine with yourself, and fine with failing. Its not bad to fail, I used to see it as an opportunity to make a friend and learn something about them, and if someone is going to drop friendship for a little honesty, well they weren't worth the friendship anyway.

Finally, Life is hard and difficult and shitty, but we're all in it together. People don't understand strength, they understand weakness, we're all weak, and anyone that thinks different is completely and utterly deluded. You want people to respect you, you want to respect yourself, let people see your weaknesses. They are the most real and powerful thing that you have. You showed me something that made you feel weak on the internet, and I responded, that is the meat of true human interaction.

You'd be hard-pressed finding much use for cultural calendars in day-to-day life. I've lived in Japan for over a year now and can count on one hand how many times I've seen non-Western dating. I've opened a bank account here, pay bills every month, conduct business, etc., etc.

As for as social relations and all of that--very Westernized. Even the stuff that's not is incredibly easy to adjust to. I've taught business men here how to manage and work with Westerners. Most of it was fairly nitpicky stuff.

Seriously, go around any major Japanese city. Go to the older, more run-down parts of them and then gravitate towards the newer stuff. The biggest difference you'll see between the two is a Western influence. Osaka, in particular, is a phenomenal example of this.

I will admit, however, that if you go towards older and more secluded cities and places, it won't feel like home at all. I live about 40 minutes away on the local train line from some pretty isolated areas. Beautiful, but thoroughly unfamiliar.

I honestly think people tend to exaggerate Japanese austerity and American looseness. You'll find a bunch of exceptions on both sides. There are plenty of Americans slavishly dedicated to their companies. Likewise, there are plenty of free-wheeling Japanese people.

Overall, however, I don't feel like life is too different here.

"cllx8v4","I can say whatever I feel like, I don't see it as art, so I can say it's not art, and define it as what I see it as. I'm allowed to say it isn't art. You're allowed to say it is art. I'm not sure why you decided to harp me about not considering it art, and telling me to watch what I say because it might offend someone. Clearly you understand that art is based on the perspective lens of the person viewing it(my point about the definition being too broad), so why even get like that with your comments? And forgive me for assuming that a question like that with no further clarification wasn't an attack towards me. 

The reason that I don't agree with the definition of art, is that I consider a requirement for art to be a beautiful thing, worthy of someone's attention. The creation of something that moves the person experiencing it, and is felt by the soul. The fact that anything that is ""expressive""(that anyone can say it's expressive, even with no clear expression to be more specific) can be considered art, just seems... Wrong. Any little thing in the world can then be called art. When anyone can call anything art, I feel it degrades the reputation of skill and reverence of the arts. Truly beautiful things were created. Something must be beautiful and inspiring for me to consider it art. I don't consider pole dancing either... Human movement won't ever be a truly beautiful thing in my eyes. It's fascinating, impressive, and skillful, but it just isn't the creation of something beautiful, to me. A dance will never instill emotion in me, never allow me to feel anything. Flipping around on a pole showing off skill, isn't beautiful. I can appreciate the massive amount of practice, mastering of movement, and all that. But it just isn't the creation of something inspiring, to me. I'm not the only one that feels this way. 

I do not consider mechanical movement, stirring to the soul. I do not understand how anyone could. When I see a shaolin monk practicing, a pole dancer dancing, a ballerina moving... I just don't see it as worthy of being art. Expression of the one creating the art, seems a defunct part of the definition. I don't really feel it's important to the definition(I do however feel that the artist expressing their feeling into it, is a wonderful thing, and the key to creating something beautiful). But I do not see a need for that being in the definition. Literally everyone expresses themselves, in everything they do in life. A part of them comes out through the things they do, and the way they do it, no matter what it is. This is why I see the expression part as ridiculous and vague. It can be applied to everything. Everyone does and should express themselves in what they do. I just don't feel that opening the definition of art that broadly will ever be a good thing for it. I feel it will degrade what once was completely respected, even further. I do not wish beautiful things to ever stop being created, due to societal scorn from seeing anything and everything being considered art. I wish for art to be a respected part of society again, instead of looked down upon as it currently is(the second you mention an arts degree, much more often than not, people will look at you like you're a fucking idiot).

I dunno. There are just some things that I don't see ever being beautiful. You're free to feel the same, of course. Pick this apart however you like, I'm not sure I really care to argue about it anymore. Thinking about the state of art is making me worry about the future of it, and don't really want to think about it anymore.",1414474993,"something must be beautiful and inspiring for me to consider it art.","beautiful and inspiring","beautiful",NA,FALSE,"beautiful and inspiring","inspiring",NA,NA,1

And if you don't get that answer, he cannot move in. Simple. You do not get rid of Lolly, nor Toast. You get rid of him if it comes down to an ultimatum of 'It's me or the cat(s).' 

I say this because not only are pets serious responsibilities that can't just be handed off so easily, but your Lolly is a priceless tie to someone very important to you that is no longer around. She is not just a responsibility, nor a memento/memorial: she is BOTH. And that means she will always have a special priority in your life. You mention drinking, which is an even bigger concern -- why risk a relapse over your (arguably healthy) coping mechanism being removed? If he can't accept these things, he's not mature enough to be in a relationship with you -- or anyone, for that matter, because grief and loss and recovery are a part of, oh, I dunno, *life?* Which becomes essentially tied to his (and his to yours) when you cohabitate? Yeah. Don't feel 'weird' compared to this guy. I wouldn't be surprised if he's trying to make you feel that way just so he can get what he wants. 

Other people have asked this same question, but: does he know the significance of the cat? I'm guessing he must.

Routine: put it on at the same time everyday, normalize it, make it so something is ""missing"" if your kid isn't wearing it. For us it's in the morning for an hour (we started at 12 hours a day). 

Variety: what patches do you use? Is it the blend beige ones? Is it a cloth one? Did you know that they make fancy ones with spider man webs and hulk designs, spiders, soccer balls, etc etc?

"ckwdhj5","Muramasa - Periphery

This song is just truly epic to me. I think the intro harmonies to this song are just some of the most amazing I've heard. They give me chills every time, as I can just feel the energy building up into the rest of the song. This one really is a testament to Spencer's vocal ability, in my opinion, with a great mix of harsh and clean vocals.


Blood Petals - Corelia

I'm not really sure what it is about this song exactly, but it just sounds amazing in every way. Starts out the first minute or so with harsh vocails, and then recedes into just one of the most beautiful songs I've ever heard. It's beautiful, but full of energy and musical technicality. Simply amazing.


Nocturne - TesseracT

I've actually just began listening to TesseracT after being introduced to them on here, and I immediately fell in love with their style. Their vocalist has an amazing and surprisingly clean voice, and it's easy to just sort of get lost in the music. This song in particular has kind of weird verses that fade in and out, but has an extremely strong chorus that's just a complete change to what goes on in the rest of the song. It all sounds great, and I picture the chorus as sort of a breakthrough point of the song.


Faiseurs de mondes - Alcest

Shit, I don't even know what to say about this one. Relaxing music, but very interesting. This one has some harsh vocals in it but they are kinda faded. Adds to the general aura of the song- not exactly happy but definitely entrancing almost.

Wife of a cousin of mine. She works as a model, very good looking and beautiful. But for her full time gig, she works as a cosplayer for amusement parks, so she is around children a lot. Then one night, my bf and I was over at a friend‚Äôs house and we ended up watching this independent low budget B-movie, some random Russian comedy gore film that his friend downloaded, ones of those films that will ever barely see the light of day unless you somehow stumbled upon online. Eventually it turned out to have lots of disturbing erotic explicit stuff in there as well. About 30 minutes in, there was a weird scene where some half vampire guy began having sex with a fully nude dead woman lying on a slab. They then pan on a shot of her face and her bare chest and to our shock, it was my cousin‚Äôs wife playing the corpse. Eventually the vampire guy tore her to pieces as he ate her. I guess he‚Äôs was a cannibal vampire as well. My bf and I were totally WTF‚Äôed out. I was somewhat traumatized for weeks. From then on, whenever I see her in our seasonal family gatherings, it became very very awkward, and of course I never said a thing to her about it and honestly, I don‚Äôt think my cousin or anyone else knew she acted in that role.

* *Trailer:* No good ones, sadly. It‚Äôs a difficult show to make one for, I suppose

* *What it's about:* On the surface, Hinamizawa is a peaceful idyllic town. Keiichi Maebara certainly agrees, after settling into a new life at school surrounded by young girls. But nothing is as it seems; dark secrets and a string of murders are just the beginning, and it isn't long before Keiichi is at the centre of a widening gyre of horror, gore, torture and murderous insanity. 

* *Why watch it:* Horror is a difficult genre for animated shows to pull off. The abstraction makes it difficult for the audience to empathise and get into the right state of tension. Higurashi is one of the rare successes, capitalising on a sense of foreboding in the early sections, and then upon its odd format later. The show is broken into a series of arcs, each covering the same time period but from a different perspective. With each ""reset"", you know exactly how bad things are going to get, but you don't know how it'll get there.

* *Caveats:* **Do not let yourself be fooled by the first episode.** While even the opening episode does drop some hints about what's to come, it's still a pretty cutesy-poo way to start for someone expecting a horror. It's setting the stage, be patient.

* *Themes:* Sin and atonement.

* *Similar works:* **[Shiki](http://myanimelist.net/anime/7724/Shiki)**

**[Kara no Kyoukai](http://myanimelist.net/anime/2593/Kara_no_Kyoukai_1:_Fukan_Fuukei)**

* *Trailer:* [DVD trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT4fLsL94Go)

* *What it's about:* An urban fantasy set in the TYPE-MOON universe, Kara no Kyoukai is a series of ""films"" (more like extended episodes). The story alternates focus between two characters and their relationship with one another. The first, Mikiya Kokuto, is an everyman - a harmless, friendly guy who becomes intrigued Shiki Ryogi, a beautiful but unsociable girl. As he tries to become closer to Shiki, he realizes that she‚Äôs somehow connected to the mysterious deaths, and that the supernatural forces involved could kill him. The first film is set some years after their introduction. Reunited with Mikiya, now employed as an investigator for T≈çko Aozaki, Shiki assists T≈çko's detective agency, Garan no Dou, whenever combat is required, while struggling to come to terms with her identity.

* *Why you should watch it:* Kara no Kyoukai is something of a cross between a mystery series, an action series, and a romance series. The animation is first-rate (as expected of ufotable), and the directorial choices are generally spot on. Add onto that a phenomenal soundtrack and you've got a strong contender right out of the gate. The story itself is something like a puzzle, made up of self-contained episodes shown out of chronological order (if you're familiar with The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzimiya, it's a lot like that). There's enough going on in each episode to keep you interested but the series requires you to take a holistic view, seeing each episode as part of a greater whole.

* *Caveats:* This was one of Nasu's earlier writing projects, and it shows. The first episode or two are quite slow, with much of the necessary context left unexplained until ""flashback"" episodes later on. Episodes 5 and 7 are by far the strongest and to some degree carry the entire series.

* *Themes:* Dualism, identity.

The further out from Asheville you go, the more you're in 100% Appalachia which historically and to the present day struggles with serious poverty, unemployment, poor job prospects, hunger, etc.

Asheville is considered a very desirable place to live so property prices are stupid high. So is the cost of living. I recommend Weaverville or Mars Hill. Have also only heard great things about Brevard but have never been there. 

Jobs are a big deal. It is recommended to have one lined up, or be able to bring it with you, or have a very large savings account to float you until you can find something. The area depends heavily on tourism, and the season is ending soon.

Though I don't *know* that I'd want a ball gown. I like how some of them look. My dress folders are my favorite. One or two of almost every style of dress made my ""favorites of favorites"" folder. Mermaids, A line, ball gown, lace, no lace, tea length, knee height. 

I think part of it is because I've never worn an actual gown before. I never went to any of my high school dances or anything so the only thing I've ever worn are cocktail and maxi dresses. I completely can't conceive of how I would feel actually *in* any of them, so I save all of them and will presumably figure it out later. I want to like what I wear. And because I've never worn something even vaguely like that before, I want to rock the shit out of it while I can. I mean why the fuck not?

And then I want to love what I eat. + lots of alcohol at this dinner.

Mind you, I'm a short guy at 5'5"". She was pretty, but Amazonian. My 6'2"" suitemate asked, ""Hey man, if you're not interested, you know I dig big women. So the whole night I kept trying to pawn her off with him. At some point as the party was winding down, he asked her to accompany him to the vending machine and I made my escape. 

I was tired, so I climbed into bed. About 15 min later, I hear the door open and assumed it was my roomie coming in to crash or snag something. Then I see the hulking shadow come over to my bed and climb in. I was drunk and started to get up, but then the meaty paws flex and held me down.

I was a college wrestler and would wrestle larger guys in practice, but I've never faced strength so forceful. I started to say, ""I don't think we should..."" and she shushed me. I wriggled, but she bascially just playground pinned me and started to gyrate. I wanted nothing to do with her, but couldn't help by get physically turned on.

She had no panties on under her skirt and pretty easily just over-powered me. It was odd as hell. I wanted nothing to do with it, but at the same time couldn't help but awkwardly laugh because I couldn't believe it was actually happening. I've always had long endurance, so she kept at it, and it went on for a few hours. What seemed the most rapey about it was the fact that she wouldn't let me not kiss her and kept forcefully kissing me. I could not get away and kept turning my head to the side.

She was sooo strong, like snu snu strong. Eventually I came and she started to try on top, ""that was beautiful. You're beautiful!"" She slumped off to the side and bear hugged me. Every time I'd try to get up and sneak off, she's tighten her grip.

In the morning she got up with me and puppy dogged me around. It was so strange, she couldn't take the hint to leave me along until I pulled a ""I gotta go to work,"" to which she replied, ""I'll wait.""

"cjxm8hd","I start my planning on developing the over arching plot. Like for my Vampire campaign I ended recently: ""The Prince of Toronto would like to establish a new Heaven and will elect whoever Heaven suggests the most suitable place to be the master of that area.""

Cool, my players have a goal since doing that will give them status, every vampire wants status. Now give them a reason to stick together. Vampire is pretty easy, no one wants to die, strength in numbers. Favors are also a very important currency in the vampire community. ""An elder contacts you asking and giving you support to elect and convert the Brass Rails as the next Heaven. He'll owe each of you a favor as long as that place becomes the next Heaven and one of you (the party) becomes its master.""

Alright, opposition time. Everyone hates everyone. Everyone loves themselves. Who hates the PCs more than they hate any of the NPCs? ""A vampire shoulders you hard as you exit the general meeting. 'Hey, fuck face, we' gonna make our apartment the safe place. The sun's waiting if even try.""

Then fill in the blanks you need for any detail your PCs might ask with really general answers. ""Toronto is now a rather Invictus dominated city. The Carthian Movement fell just half a decade ago due to the new Prince's coup."" 

Fill in stats for NPCs that you know will be important. Present scenes to show their character punch in the idea that these NPCs are important. ""The Prince executes the condemned vampire before her announcement. 'Disobedience will not be tolerated. I hope you'll understand.'"" or ""You exit the building and turn the corner. You see the vampire who threatened you earlier kick a garbage can at a homeless man. 'Here's your change! Suck my balls!'"" Also useful to set the mood of your campaign or scene. I like to have a line or two thought up for important NPCs so get into their mood.

So usually I present a sort of opening before telling my players to make characters, it gives them context on what kind of world they're in, what goals they have and what everyone else wants to do. Also helps them make a semi-cohesive back story so I don't have to think of something to bring them together.

Last but not least, learn the rules, head to the game and not be afraid to lie. Everything you tell your players will become the truth, so just keep track of what you say so you're consistent in the future.

In short:

1. Give your story a goal. ""Party needs to rescue monster from princess.""

2. Present the goal to the party. ""A weak and battered monster begging  on the street for anyone to free his companions from the grasp of the extremely beautiful but cruel princess.""

3. Scene the presentation. ""The kobold is ignored by most, some even kicking dirt at him. An arm seems broken and there are obvious bruises seen on his face and body. He pleas and begs, odd for a kobold to do so, especially in this city.""

4. Bullshit ""Yea, roll a bardic knowledge check on that. TWENTY?! Um... she isn't known to be cruel and actually has many suitors in waiting.

"cjmvfne","I can throw in what I know and like listening to, if you'd like, sure. I'm not a master of genres or anything so anyone else with other suggestions are certainly welcome. I don't know how I'd order it though or anything so I'll just make a list:

* [**Yukari**](http://yukari.bandcamp.com/) A one-lady-does-it-all chillwave project. She's currently working on her next EP, a follow-up to her incredible Echo EP debut.

* [**Ohheejung**](http://ohheejung.bandcamp.com/album/everybody-here-wants-you-back) Another one-lady-does-it-all project. Her debut, Everybody here wants you back, is more instrument-focused than her follow-up but it remains my favorite. It's a beautiful album with a hugely satisfying climax.

* [**Haihm**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsPEKrz6U5w) How many solo-lady producers until I get bonus points? This is a hat trick, right? Her debut, Point 9, flew completely under my radar. Which is strange, considering her glitchtronica single was so good it caught actual mainstream attention in South Korea.

* [**Suiyobi no Campanella**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6Iv7O9qAHg) More progressive house than anything, but KOM_I's vocals are just hypnotizing. There is so much personality in their music. They're currently my favorite thing going on right now.

* [**Shingo Nakamura**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z38PBw7L_tc) Progressive house again. Sorry, this is off-topic but his Days album is *incredible*. It's easily my favorite release this year and I don't see that changing any time soon. Must listen, IMO.

* [**Oohyo**](http://oohyo.bandcamp.com/album/girl-sense) Another solo producer. Astonishing indie debut. Her whole EP is super-captivating. Great production and wonderful vocals.

* [**Andrew Bayer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ii-ZkCl2HE) His new album, If It Were You, We'd Never Leave, is excellent but It's Artificial remains my favorite. An incredible trip through the mind of an insanely talented producer.

* [**Casker**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uleZ2S-xWqY) Their music is... odd. Some of their releases are very pop-like, some aren't. Those that aren't, like their more indietronic Tender album, are gorgeous.

* [**Ken Ishii**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlMhyRLYojc) Tech House. Like nothing on WORLDS, but worth checking out. His music is profoundly atmospheric. It's like listening to Ghost in the Shell soundtracks over and over. I love it.

* [**Kashiwa Daisuke**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ap0m-7V0lhs) Though primarily a piano composer, his experimental work, like his Re: album, is terrific. Even if it spoils the climax of the album, you should listen to Ajanagar. It's pure bliss.

* [**Neon Bunny**](http://neonbunny.bandcamp.com/) Synthpop at its finest, IMO. Her new single, It's You, is gorgeous but it's got nothing on her [Happy Ending EP](https://itunes.apple.com/ca/album/happy-ending-ep/id556786084).

* [**Igorrr**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKp30C3MwVk) I don't know how I'd describe Igorrr. It's... a beautiful but chaotic journey through the strangest sounds I've ever heard. Just... listen and see for yourself, and I don't blame you if you're just like nah man nope.

* [**Sima Kim**](http://simakim.bandcamp.com/album/ur-silhouette) An ambient/instrumental hip-hop producer. He's kind of all over the place release-wise (you'll find his stuff on like, eight different labels online) but his work is great. His Debris album is still my favorite ambient/drone album.

* [**Nhato**](http://youtu.be/cSavx8xgrbU) When his Etude album came out, I thought to myself ""man, this is the album that'll save electro"". I guess it didn't, because I still can't stand most electro music, but Etude remains one of my favorite listens. 

* [**she**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzClkMxdsgI) The godfather of ""I'm going to put pretty female vocals on top of punchy, atmospheric electronica."" I think he's grown to become an insufferable asshole but he still makes good music. I just don't feel good supporting him anymore.

* [**edIT**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j81fYZVvFh4) Before there was The Glitch Mob, there was edIT's solo music. I think Certified Air Raid Material might be my favorite album of his but Crying Over Pros for No Reason is landmark.

* [**effe**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrlbwCGkT8w) I know nothing about whoever is behind their project, other than knowing they make terrific music. Both visible / invisible and Adolescence Again are terrific.

Hopefully that keeps you busy! It skews a bit to East Asian music but that's just the field I'm into, I dunno. :T Some of them stray from the genres you asked for but I kinda went for what came to mind when I thought of WORLDS and what catches my ear like that music did to him.

To be fair, it wasn't a hook up. I genuinely liked the guy.. but, really mostly just because he looked like Ville Valo and was a sweetie. 

It wasn't anything he said as such, but the way anything anyone else - anything that wasn't completely basic - said went *right over his head*. You'd try talking to him about something and he'd look at you all confused with these big beautiful eyes and just keep quiet making confused faces. And sometimes going 'huh?'. Then he'd just smile.

"cjcpj0t","I looked out from the window in the plane and the Rockies welcomed me home. They were breathtaking. Literally. Once I and my then girlfriend went on a backpacking/lovemaking/get-me-the-fuck-out-of-my-parents-house trip, and the oxygen levels weren‚Äôt sufficient enough‚Ä¶let‚Äôs just say I should never leave the house without my inhaler. The Rockies are unlike any other mountain range I‚Äôve ever seen. And I‚Äôve seen many. The Olympic Mountains (snowy, so tolerable), Santa Ana Mountains (near L.A., so not tolerable), the Guadalupe Mountains (Texas) and the ones at which I‚Äôve lived for the past two decades, the Alps (beautiful, but obnoxious). Every time I‚Äôve been near other mountain ranges all I could think about was how shitty they were and how wonderful the Rockies are. 

Occasionally I find myself somehow slithering them into conversations where they don‚Äôt belong or daydreaming about them when I should be focusing on centuries old microscopic organisms or listening to my wife rant on and on about her bitch of a sister. I know I‚Äôm annoying people when I do this, but I just want someone else to understand their significance to me and my life. The Rockies are a part of me, and I feel as though they‚Äôre just as important as my liver or my kidneys or my Dad. Wait, who am I kidding? Fuck my Dad. The point is, I love the Rockies. And here I am. I‚Äôm back. It feels like I‚Äôve lived several lives while I‚Äôve been away, and leaving them was perhaps the most difficult thing I‚Äôve ever done, but I‚Äôm back. 

After landing and spending entirely too long waiting for my luggage to roll around my children welcomed me at one of the entrances. And although it was nice to see them and all, everyone knew I wouldn‚Äôt really feel like I was home until I was on the trails. So, they dropped me off at the entrance to the park after making me promise to take them to see the latest Nicholas Sparks/John Green/Piece of Shit movie that was out in theaters. The things we do for our children. 

I hiked with my ready-made backpack for no less than 7 hours before I finally saw the spot: the slightly raised mound of grass. I‚Äôm unashamed to say my mouth did begin to water slightly, or‚Ä¶more than slightly, hell, who‚Äôs keeping track? I never feel as clever as I do when I see that small raised pile of earth. To the untrained, and maybe even trained, eye you wouldn‚Äôt even notice it. But I knew exactly what it was and how monumental it was. This was the sort of thing that changes cultures and societies. It changes families. Just‚Ä¶it changes people. I know, because it changed me. It changed my family. And even though it took several hours with a compact shovel to dig it up, I knew in the end it would be worth it. 

In the end, with almost overzealous care, I used tongs to pry open the cardboard box. And‚Ä¶nothing. It was gone.

"cj7vpn7","You can gank a lane in many different ways with Yi.

Pre 6 you arn't going to be able to steamroll someone like you would with your ult. Yi's biggest strength in lane is being able to force someone to immediately run away or be cut to ribbons due to the raw dmg he can output, with the pressure of whoever is in the lane. Pre 6?

Depends on the mobility of your opponents, because anyone who can just dash away or out of a fight with their lane partner is gonna be hard to gank pre-6. Imagine a Silver 3 match; Renekton versus Shyv top. Yi can be on either team in this scenario. No wards. They both go all in at 3. Yi WALKS into lane from top brush, opponent flashes away; you alpha onto him and a few attacks later, you kill him. You can even dive at this point if you have high hp *and flash is still up* and/or your laner is also with you. 

I try to think very purely when playing Yi. Like Udyr. It's a LOT about positioning, timing. Going in and out. With both of them having insane speed, you can juke skillshots at extremely point blank range, duck into a bush for the last few seconds on an Alpha and jump back onto their backline in the middle of a teamfight.

I enjoyed the game play. They really made it seem like you were stuck in an apocalyptic world. The environment was beautiful but dark and gloomy. It focuses a lot on stealth. There are no AK47s or M4s like we have. All the weapons are jury-rigged and crudely made like you'd expect after the apocalypse. Currency is bullets. So you can either choose to spend 50 bullets on a new gun but risk having less ammo or have 50 extra shots. It also has a horror survival aspect. There are creatures that stalk the outside world. And they are very coolly designed. You spend part of your time in the metro tunnels and the other on the outside where you are forced to use a gas mask. The gas mask also has limited usage of oxygen so you have to race to find more filters(even though you find a lot so it's not that hard). 

The story is set in Moscow after being bombarded by atomic bombs and survivors are forced to hide out in the metro tunnels. You play as a Russian soldier trying to survive. The radiation mutated the animals that got stuck in the blasts and transformed them into these creatures.

People think I went behind a friend and tried I steal her ex bf (not sure that's how it works but okay).

Truth is, after they broke up I started a FWB thing with him, they remained friends and he introduced me to her. Then she asked if I wanted a gym buddy. We bonded over the next few months. She told me how she horrible things she did to him, and horrid things she was currently doing to all her/our mutual friends (trying to sleep with their bf's, break them up, etc).

I kept it all to myself and planning on leaving the group after my lease was up since everyone was so fucking shady (including the dude I was sleeping with). He caught wind I was not going to stick around and that his ex (the girl I was friends with) was sleeping around. He then spilled he beans to her that we're were dating (nope) and she lost her shit. Started tons of lies about me and essentially had me ""vanquished"" from the group of ""friends"". After I didn't retaliate (because no point in fighting for things you don't want or like) she took it to a crazy level.

Everyone still believes her since I didn't bother telling anyone what was really happening. And too be honest that is fine with me.

She was insane. And about two years after that I found a bunch of porn she'd made online. No I wasn't looking, and I found it on reddit.

"cix8ege","If you look at polygamous cultures (Saudi Arabia, China, ancient Israel), they are not as problematic, mathematically, as everyone seems to think. The key point is that only the richest several percentage points routinely marry multiple women, with the highest status men, like a king or emperor having the most wives or concubines. (This also had the benefit of stabilizing dynasties, as men with multiple wives were more likely to produce a male heir.)

So if 1% of the men are marrying 3% of the women, the net effect of this is that you'll just have a few more men on the bottom social strata lacking wives. If your country goes to war a lot, it might even balance out.

Even in countries today where polygamy technically isn't practiced, it is often more common for a rich man to have a mistress than a poor man. In countries like Malaysia and China, it is semi-expected behavior. There's still some elderly men like [Stanley Ho]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Ho) that have multiple wives, since polygamy was only outlawed in 1971. 

Fun fact: in China, it was traditionally the role of the first wife to pick out the secondary wife(s) for her husband, though this wasn't always followed. Advice from the time recommended picking someone beautiful but dumb, so that she couldn't challenge your dominance of the household.

I should like to help everyone - if possible - Jew, Gentile - black man - white. We all want to help one another. Human beings are like that. We want to live by each other‚Äôs happiness - not by each other‚Äôs misery. We don‚Äôt want to hate and despise one another. In this world there is room for everyone. And the good earth is rich and can provide for everyone. The way of life can be free and beautiful, but we have lost the way.

Greed has poisoned men‚Äôs souls, has barricaded the world with hate, has goose-stepped us into misery and bloodshed. We have developed speed, but we have shut ourselves in. Machinery that gives abundance has left us in want. Our knowledge has made us cynical. Our cleverness, hard and unkind. We think too much and feel too little. More than machinery we need humanity. More than cleverness we need kindness and gentleness. Without these qualities, life will be violent and all will be lost....

The aeroplane and the radio have brought us closer together. The very nature of these inventions cries out for the goodness in men - cries out for universal brotherhood - for the unity of us all. Even now my voice is reaching millions throughout the world - millions of despairing men, women, and little children - victims of a system that makes men torture and imprison innocent people.

To those who can hear me, I say - do not despair. The misery that is now upon us is but the passing of greed - the bitterness of men who fear the way of human progress. The hate of men will pass, and dictators die, and the power they took from the people will return to the people. And so long as men die, liberty will never perish. .....

Soldiers! don‚Äôt give yourselves to brutes - men who despise you - enslave you - who regiment your lives - tell you what to do - what to think and what to feel! Who drill you - diet you - treat you like cattle, use you as cannon fodder. Don‚Äôt give yourselves to these unnatural men - machine men with machine minds and machine hearts! You are not machines! You are not cattle! You are men! You have the love of humanity in your hearts! You don‚Äôt hate! Only the unloved hate - the unloved and the unnatural! Soldiers! Don‚Äôt fight for slavery! Fight for liberty!

In the 17th Chapter of St Luke it is written: ‚Äúthe Kingdom of God is within man‚Äù - not one man nor a group of men, but in all men! In you! You, the people have the power - the power to create machines. The power to create happiness! You, the people, have the power to make this life free and beautiful, to make this life a wonderful adventure.

Then - in the name of democracy - let us use that power - let us all unite. Let us fight for a new world - a decent world that will give men a chance to work - that will give youth a future and old age a security. By the promise of these things, brutes have risen to power. But they lie! They do not fulfill that promise. They never will!

Dictators free themselves but they enslave the people! Now let us fight to fulfill that promise! Let us fight to free the world - to do away with national barriers - to do away with greed, with hate and intolerance. Let us fight for a world of reason, a world where science and progress will lead to all men‚Äôs happiness. Soldiers! in the name of democracy, let us all unite!

"cie1oal","My sister from another mister... I feel you. I'm in canada, but left half my heart in NZ last year. Sometimes I feel depressed thinking I won't be able to return to your country again in my lifetime. Then I think about how beautiful canada is and I feel a little bit better. Where in kiwi land are you?

More on topic- I have struggled with depression since I was a preteen. Probably even before that, because I remember having really negative thoughts as early as 8 years old. But I wasn't diagnosed until 14 years old. Anyway, I haven't been on meds for almost 6 years now because I was able to recognize patterns in my depression and use mental tools to work through it. It sounds like you're able to at least recognize the coming storm and that's the most important part. When you can recognize that it's coming, you can take steps to stop it or at least ease the pain! 

My depression is the worst in winter time, and this winter was especially bad. It was my first winter in a year and a half (the one before it was spent in the glorious NZ heat). I was not prepared :( the cold was painful. The snow was beautiful but terrifying as it covered a thick layer of ice. found out I was pregnant Christmas Eve, which was lovely, but then January-March was pretty much spent in bed/on the couch. So here are some things I did to get through it:

- most importantly, I told my husband anytime I was having a really really bad day. He would then stop whatever he was doing and remind me of what was positive and good in our lives.

- take care of myself by taking baths, cooking my favourite meals(when I had the energy), do my nails, etc... 

- acknowledge negative thoughts, indulge in the feeling of sadness and move on. This one is hard to get the hang of but I find it's my most helpful mental tool. I was taught by a therapist that it is important to acknowledge feelings of sadness, they are apart of life. It is healthy to be sad. It is not healthy to ignore the feelings, or to indulge in them for too long. I find if I truly let myself feel sad and cry it out, I feel so much better than when I fight it and can move on sooner.
 
- remember that winter IS temporary!!! You are lucky you are in NZ. Our winter here was one of the worst in my living memory and it lasted well into May (that's like if your winter lasted until November... I think) It felt like it would never end! But it did and now I have to be super pregnant during our hottest months of the year :P 

I didn't mean for this to be so long but oh well. I hope it helps you at least a little bit. You can always PM me if you want to chat! Chin up and remember - you live in the most beautiful country in the world, even if the winter seems to mask that beauty :) ",1403447974,"the snow was beautiful but terrifying as it covered a thick layer of ice. found out i was pregnant christmas eve, which was lovely, but then january-march was pretty much spent in bed/on the couch.","beautiful but terrifying","beautiful","but",FALSE,"beautiful but terrifying","terrifying",NA,NA,1

"cidysnc","1. We had lots of test before our daughter was born. We had an Amniocentesis which is where amniotic fluid is removed from the womb and Karyotype testing where all the chromosomes are analysed. I assumed that because the results were fine, everything would be ok. But no - our daughter was born with some kind of genetic mutation which we have so far been unable to determine (although we suspect she has Costello's Syndrome, and are awaiting more detailed test results). We quickly researched all the possible things she might have - months of scary google searching, there are so many conditions which have been classified, but there are also lots of children out there that have no diagnosis. There are even support groups for children whose conditions are unique, and have no name since they are the only ones in the world to have the condition. I found myself almost wanting it to be a ""named"" condition, because at least there would be some support and prior research and knowledge into the best way to treat our child.

2. Our daughter was born around the same time as Prince George, and we live in the UK. I found the blanket coverage of this beautiful perfect baby quite upsetting, while our slightly strange looking baby spent the first few weeks of her life in intensive care. I suppose it was the shock, and the lack of acceptance of the situation - I just wanted my daughter to be normal and beautiful like everyone else's baby. I now realise of course she is beautiful, but it is still a bit painful to see other babies around the same age as her starting to crawl and walk, while she is so far behind.

3. Something that I have read about, and have started to experience to a small degree is social exclusion. Its human nature for people to feel awkward and not know what to say, or how to relate to parents with disabled children. We have noticed that some peoples attitude to us has changed. Just minor things at the moment, but I am expecting from what I have read that this will get worse as our daughter gets older, and her disabilities get more obvious.

4. As others have mentioned - the future is scary. The way I cope at the moment, is I don't think about the future. I find it too difficult - its much better to live in the moment, and enjoy what each day brings.

5. I found this poem helpful, and have sent it to a few people. I have found telling fiends about our daughters condition has brought a few of them to tears - so this is a good follow up to make them (and us) feel a bit better:

&gt; WELCOME TO HOLLAND

&gt; by Emily Perl Kingsley.

&gt; c1987 by Emily Perl Kingsley. All rights reserved

&gt; I am often asked to describe the experience of raising a child with a
&gt; disability - to try to help people who have not shared that unique
&gt; experience to understand it, to imagine how it would feel. It's like
&gt; this......

&gt; When you're going to have a baby, it's like planning a fabulous 
&gt; vacation trip - to Italy. You buy a bunch of guide books and make
&gt; your wonderful plans. The Coliseum. The Michelangelo David. The
&gt; gondolas in Venice. You may learn some handy phrases in Italian. It's
&gt; all very exciting.

&gt; After months of eager anticipation, the day finally arrives. You pack
&gt; your bags and off you go. Several hours later, the plane lands. The
&gt; stewardess comes in and says, ""Welcome to Holland.""

&gt; ""Holland?!?"" you say. ""What do you mean Holland?? I signed up for
&gt; Italy! I'm supposed to be in Italy. All my life I've dreamed of going to
&gt; Italy.""

&gt; But there's been a change in the flight plan. They've landed in Holland
&gt; and there you must stay.

&gt; The important thing is that they haven't taken you to a horrible,
&gt; disgusting, filthy place, full of pestilence, famine and disease. It's just
&gt; a different place.

&gt; So you must go out and buy new guide books. And you must learn a
&gt; whole new language. And you will meet a whole new group of people
&gt; you would never have met.

&gt; It's just a different place. It's slower-paced than Italy, less flashy
&gt; than Italy. But after you've been there for a while and you catch your
&gt; breath, you look around.... and you begin to notice that Holland has
&gt; windmills....and Holland has tulips. Holland even has Rembrandts.

&gt; But everyone you know is busy coming and going from Italy... and
&gt; they're all bragging about what a wonderful time they had there. And
&gt; for the rest of your life, you will say ""Yes, that's where I was
&gt; supposed to go. That's what I had planned.""

&gt; And the pain of that will never, ever, ever, ever go away... because
&gt; the loss of that dream is a very very significant loss.

&gt; But... if you spend your life mourning the fact that you didn't get to
&gt; Italy, you may never be free to enjoy the very special, the very
&gt; lovely things ... about Holland.

"ci9acvn","**[Kara no Kyoukai](http://myanimelist.net/anime/2593/Kara_no_Kyoukai_1:_Fukan_Fuukei)**

* *Trailer:* [DVD trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT4fLsL94Go)

* *What it's about:* The nonlinear storytelling makes a description quite hard. It's an urban fantasy set in the TYPE-MOON universe, Kara no Kyoukai is a series of ""films"" (more like extended episodes). The story alternates focus between two characters and their relationship with one another. The first, Mikiya Kokuto, is an everyman - a harmless, friendly guy who becomes intrigued Shiki Ryogi, a beautiful but unsociable girl. As he tries to become closer to Shiki, he realizes that she‚Äôs somehow connected to the mysterious deaths, and that the supernatural forces involved could kill him. The first film is set some years after their introduction. Reunited with Mikiya, now employed as an investigator for T≈çko Aozaki, Shiki assists T≈çko's detective agency, Garan no Dou, whenever combat is required, while struggling to come to terms with her identity.

* *Why you should watch it:* Kara no Kyoukai is something of a cross between a mystery series, an action series, and a romance series. The animation is first-rate (as expected of ufotable), and the directorial choices are generally spot on. Add onto that a phenomenal soundtrack and you've got a strong contender right out of the gate. The story itself is something like a puzzle, made up of self-contained episodes shown out of chronological order (if you're familiar with The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzimiya, it's a lot like that). There's enough going on in each episode to keep you interested but the series requires you to take a holistic view, seeing each episode as part of a greater whole.

* *Caveats:* This was one of Nasu's earlier writing projects, and it shows. The first episode or two are quite slow, with much of the necessary context left unexplained until ""flashback"" episodes later on. Episodes 5 and 7 are by far the strongest and to some degree carry the entire series.

* *Themes:* Dualism, identity.

* *Similar works:* **Canaan**, **Fate/Stay Night**

‚ÄúHahaha, Kevin that‚Äôs not a red card! That‚Äôs green! Put a different one down.‚Äù Mark chuckled. ‚ÄúReally? It‚Äôs green? Man, I‚Äôm color-blind and suck at Uno.‚Äù I replied back, slightly defeated. I‚Äôve never been able to play card - or board - games that rely heavily on color coordination due to my disability. My entire family can see the whole color spectrum, except for me. Reds and greens look the same to me and darker shades are harder to differentiate. 

‚ÄúI think I basically won anyways, so let‚Äôs call it for the day. Sound good?‚Äù Mark asked, ‚ÄúYeah, sounds good to me.‚Äù I replied. ‚ÄúKevin, you still down to go camping with us this weekend? We have room in our car if you want to ride down with us too.‚Äù Mark asked, changing the subject quickly. ‚ÄúTotally still down, been looking forward to getting away for the weekend for awhile now. I‚Äôd love to ride with you guys. I‚Äôm going to head home now, there‚Äôs a few errands I have to do still tonight, so I‚Äôll text you later ok man?‚Äù ‚ÄúYeah see ya.‚Äù

I walked briskly out of Mark‚Äôs apartment, took a right and headed down Mill Street. I‚Äôve known the guy for most of my life, he was the first friend I made in elementary school and we have stayed best friends since then. He knows how insecure I am about my color-blindness, and never makes fun of me intentionally about it but it still gets to me sometimes. I often wonder what it‚Äôd be like to see what a vibrant red rose actually looked like, or how green the Pacific Northwest really is. But alas, I won‚Äôt and I‚Äôve accepted to live my muted tone life as best I could. 

I stroll up to the house my family has lived in for nearly 15 years, a 1920‚Äôs Craftsman home sandwiched between more Craftsmans on a crowded street. As I walk into the house my mother yells ‚ÄúHi honey! We‚Äôre all in the living room, can you come join us please?‚Äù. Us, I repeated to myself wondering who all is here. I step into the living room and notice my mother, father, Uncle Mike, my cousin Sara, and Aunt Debbie all sitting - or standing uncomfortably - in the small room. ‚ÄúHi guys, what brings you all here today? Am I late for a dinner?‚Äù I asked. ‚ÄúKevin.‚Äù my mom said in a defeated tone, her eyes filling up with tears, ‚ÄúMom what‚Äôs wrong?‚Äù I started to panic a bit. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs your Grandpa Joe, Kev, he passed away just a few hours ago due to a heart attack. I‚Äôm sorry kid.‚Äù answered my uncle. The news took me by surprise and I sat down as fast as I could. ‚ÄúYour father and I will be going through your grandpa‚Äôs estate over the next few days and handling all the funeral arragements. He did have a will that we‚Äôll be discussing with his lawyer with tomorrow. In the meantime there were a few random trinkets scattered throughout his apartment that we thought you kids would like to have as a keepsake right now. Kevin, we all know you thoroughly enjoy books and writing and thought you would get the most enjoyment out of this notebook he had.‚Äù Uncle Mike said, handing a large, ornate book over to me. 

The book‚Äôs cover was a piece of art in itself, with gold etchings and a leatherbound strap to close it. In the center was a medallion that had flecks of colors I didn‚Äôt recognize, they caught the sunlight and seemed to burn like fire. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs beautiful‚Äù I whispered, not noticing the confused looks on everyone‚Äôs faces. ‚ÄúUhhh. It‚Äôs an old, worn-out brown book with nothing in it. I wouldn‚Äôt call it beautiful Kevin, but whatever makes you happy.‚Äù Sara said. I stared at her quizzically. 
There was no title, no author, no words at all. ‚ÄúI imagine it‚Äôs a drawing sketchbook of some sort, since every page is blank. Thought you could doodle or start a journal or something with it,‚Äù Dad said, trying to not have his voice break. ‚ÄúThanks you guys. This means a lot to me.‚Äù I tried to smile. I excused myself and head upstairs to my bedroom. 

I threw the book on to the bed, sat down next to it and kicked off my shoes. I stared at the glowing medallion and wondered what it could be made of. It was something I‚Äôve never seen before. I caressed the cover and opened up the leather strap and heard the crack of the spine being stretched open, probably for the first time in ages. ‚ÄúWhat‚Ä¶ I thought Dad said it was blank?‚Äù I thought, as I flipped through the pages and noticed handwriting covering every single page. But what caught me off guard was the color of the ink was the same as what was in the medallion, flickering ink of a color I‚Äôve never seen in my life. Could this be a true red or green and I‚Äôm only just now seeing it for the first time? Or could it be that my color-blindness is allowing me to see things others can‚Äôt? Everyone else commented on the blank pages before and how plain the cover was, they must not have seen what I‚Äôm seeing right now. The colors weren't blue, purple, green, red, yellow or any other we might recognize. It was almost like a metallic but not silver or gold, something bright and beautiful but not anything I could remember ever seeing before. 

The words filling up the pages were part gibberish to me, part formulas and equations, and part time-travelling theorems. Centrifugal force, dark matter, compossibility - all sorts of words and theories that are well above my intellect. What was Grandpa doing with this book, and was this all his own work? Did he truly think he could time travel? There were dozens of questions rushing through my head all at once.  I wanted to run downstairs and share what I found but I knew the timing wasn‚Äôt right. Perhaps after the funeral. 

I started to shut the book and let the pages flutter to a close until I reached the very last page, it read;

""Dearest Kevin, 

I am so sorry you had to learn of my passing today. I wish I could have spoken with you prior to my departure but there was no time. Please don't be sad, while I am no longer with you and the family that does not mean I am gone forever. There are bigger things in my life that need my attention and so I must address them. Time travel is real, Kevin, and with the knowledge in this book you will learn how to travel too.

""I‚Äôm sorry, but I don‚Äôt want to be an emperor. That‚Äôs not my business. I don‚Äôt want to rule or conquer anyone. I should like to help everyone - if possible - Jew, Gentile - black man - white. We all want to help one another. Human beings are like that. We want to live by each other‚Äôs happiness - not by each other‚Äôs misery. We don‚Äôt want to hate and despise one another. In this world there is room for everyone. And the good earth is rich and can provide for everyone. The way of life can be free and beautiful, but we have lost the way.

Greed has poisoned men‚Äôs souls, has barricaded the world with hate, has goose-stepped us into misery and bloodshed. We have developed speed, but we have shut ourselves in. Machinery that gives abundance has left us in want. Our knowledge has made us cynical. Our cleverness, hard and unkind. We think too much and feel too little. More than machinery we need humanity. More than cleverness we need kindness and gentleness. Without these qualities, life will be violent and all will be lost....

The aeroplane and the radio have brought us closer together. The very nature of these inventions cries out for the goodness in men - cries out for universal brotherhood - for the unity of us all. Even now my voice is reaching millions throughout the world - millions of despairing men, women, and little children - victims of a system that makes men torture and imprison innocent people.

To those who can hear me, I say - do not despair. The misery that is now upon us is but the passing of greed - the bitterness of men who fear the way of human progress. The hate of men will pass, and dictators die, and the power they took from the people will return to the people. And so long as men die, liberty will never perish.

Soldiers! don‚Äôt give yourselves to brutes - men who despise you - enslave you - who regiment your lives - tell you what to do - what to think and what to feel! Who drill you - diet you - treat you like cattle, use you as cannon fodder. Don‚Äôt give yourselves to these unnatural men - machine men with machine minds and machine hearts! You are not machines! You are not cattle! You are men! You have the love of humanity in your hearts! You don‚Äôt hate! Only the unloved hate - the unloved and the unnatural! Soldiers! Don‚Äôt fight for slavery! Fight for liberty!

In the 17th Chapter of St Luke it is written: ‚Äúthe Kingdom of God is within man‚Äù - not one man nor a group of men, but in all men! In you! You, the people have the power - the power to create machines. The power to create happiness! You, the people, have the power to make this life free and beautiful, to make this life a wonderful adventure.

Then - in the name of democracy - let us use that power - let us all unite. Let us fight for a new world - a decent world that will give men a chance to work - that will give youth a future and old age a security. By the promise of these things, brutes have risen to power. But they lie! They do not fulfill that promise. They never will!

Dictators free themselves but they enslave the people! Now let us fight to fulfill that promise! Let us fight to free the world - to do away with national barriers - to do away with greed, with hate and intolerance. Let us fight for a world of reason, a world where science and progress will lead to all men‚Äôs happiness.

"cgg984k","I really hope Powell goes in the same direction for 2 as he did the original. I merit HtTYD on its excellent writing and animation but I don't think half of the emotion and tension between the characters could have been conveyed without his masterful score. I've think I must have listened to the soundtrack more than I've watched the film; it stands alone as a story in itself. Each theme is precisely thought out and apt for the character or idea it represents and most importantly not overused (Not to bag on the Hobbit's soundtrack - which was beautiful - but I can't tell you how sick I got of hearing that damn 'Misty Mountains' motif *every* time there was the slightest of victories).

My god, I could go on and on about this soundtrack; listen to the opening number. It introduces every theme used in the latter pieces. Every idea is then expanded on, and grown separately. This is a hard enough feat in itself but for this to be the *secondary* purpose of the music is almost mind boggling. Powell's whole suite moves in a way you'd expect of a classical piece, whilst also aptly under-toning the film's visuals. I urge anyone who hasn't to listen to the soundtrack without the visuals to truly understand what I'm raving about here.

If 2 is going for anywhere near the success of 1 the soundtrack is going to have to be equally beautiful and complex. My main worry for it is it'll be the soundtrack of 1 rehashed with little introduction of new ideas. But since the trailer looks as if it is definitely going to introduce a large amount of difference, I can hope the same for the soundtrack.

[Just listened to the two trailers.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68AqHwgk2s8) I'm not sure how much of it will be used in the film but the main theme in the first trailer is used again in the second and definitely sounds like HtTYD score material.

"cgg6kwn","Hey, not sure if you're still reading this thread, but I just noticed and and I definitely have some insight.

I moved to Wasilla exactly a year ago two days from now. I came from Anchorage, and I definitely felt some trepidition going from a big, bustling city to a smaller, more rural area.

But as far as it goes, thus far, my life has been functionally the same from when I lived in Anchorage, minus a few things. Everything is more spread out here, so depending on where you live you can expect to drive a bit further to the grocery store and such. Obviously, that depends on where your place is.

We've got basically everything Anchorage does. Grocery stores, clothing stores, garages, thrift stores, book stores, etc. You'll want for nothing when it comes to sundries and clothes and such. 

As far as things to do, the bar scene out here isn't amazing. I don't bar hop anymore, but from what I've *heard* there's not a lot of fun places. There are plenty of bars, but all the big, fun, dancing/drinking/meeting the ladies bars are in Anchorage.

As for other entertainment, we have a good movie theater, a bowling alley, parks, etc. That said, the real attraction out here is the hiking, camping, and lake stuff. Do those things. You're pretty close to tons of trail heads and lakes and fishing.

The ONLY thing I really miss about Anchorage is the restaurant scene. Anchorage has tons of delicious restaurants, and Wasilla...Well...Doesn't. We have a few, don't get me wrong. There's an amazing cheap burger place named R and W, that has great greasy spoon type cheap burgers. They're incredible, and cheaper than Carls Jr (which we also have). Krazy Moose is a sub shop with absolutely delicious sandwiches...They're busy basically all the time because of how good they are. The cookies there are mind blowing. My wife and I head over there at least once a week just for a few cookies. There's a good pho/thai place named Pho Vatsana. That said, there is NO Chinese food worth mentioning out here (we've tried it all), and no good mid level steakhouse/burger/pizza places. Like Moose's Tooth in Anchorage, or Spenard Roadhouse. The places that have tons of burgers, steaks, seafood, etc, and all of it good. Basically, if you like eating out, get used to eating at the same three or four places every time, because the selection is terrible.

The grocery store scene is normal. Got a few of them. One place I do miss from Anchorage is Costco's. There's a place out here called Three Bears which has a lot of Costco products, and bulk stuff, but they're fucking expensive (aside from their produce). 

Other than that, what's nice about Wasilla is that it feels a lot cleaner and less congested than Anchoage. There are plenty of people out here, but it's so much more open. You can actually see the stars at night, unlike in Anchorage. There are tons of amazing neighborhoods that are JUST far enough away from the main ""drag"" to feel isolated and beautiful, but close enough that it's not a pain in the ass when you need toilet paper. 

In short, I love it out here, and I'm never going back to Anchorage. Aside from the shitty restaurant scene, every aspect of life out here is great compared to town.

I hope you enjoy it. :)",1396237438,"there are tons of amazing neighborhoods that are just far enough away from the main ""drag"" to feel isolated and beautiful, but close enough that it's not a pain in the ass when you need toilet paper.","isolated and beautiful","beautiful",NA,FALSE,"isolated and beautiful","isolated",NA,NA,0

Hi- I‚Äôm guessing you live in LA (maybe NYC). I do, too. It‚Äôs the stress state capital, where dreamers and overachievers come to sink or swim. I have felt like you, written like you, and had very similar pressures put on my mind and body. I‚Äôm no stranger to depression or anxiety. Or to seeing suicide as a potential solution. You‚Äôre no worse than anyone who has struggled, and doing so doesn't compromise your ability to achieve. Having been so stressed for so long leaves you barely treading water, but everyone keeps swimming away because they're afraid you'll drown them. Clinging is a survival instinct just like getting away, so you probably don‚Äôt blame the people who can‚Äôt help. But please don‚Äôt blame yourself for needing it. Even though you‚Äôre panicked and desperate, you‚Äôre asking for advice and I give you all the credit in the world just for that. My advice is to do what has to be done: Stop struggling and start floating. It sounds like self-help because it is- I can tell you what to do, but you have to do it. That‚Äôs the hard part. 

The difference between treading and floating is simple: Breathe and balance. It's an incredible act that is much harder than dying, but easier than giving birth. It‚Äôs terrifying to try because the tension feels like the only thing that keeps you going- without it you‚Äôd be adrift, helpless. Yet you‚Äôre worn out and not getting anywhere because you‚Äôre can‚Äôt conserve your strength. You‚Äôd almost prefer to sink rather than keep flailing. It hurts too much and you feel like like a failure.  

There‚Äôs the analogy. Now, the anatomy. Your endocrine system is freaking out with you. Super high cortisol turns to total adrenal burnout, thyroid imbalance and the whole cascade of hormonal crap that comes with so much stress. All the signals being sent to your brain make it too difficult to think clearly and make decisions, let alone act on them. This is all just guesswork as far as it might pertain to you, but at least it‚Äôs educated. 

Floating equals survival. Air, water and food. You are worried about where you‚Äôre going to live and how long- which I completely understand- but it‚Äôs still overreaching in your current state. Overreaching only maintains imbalance- it won‚Äôt sustain you. Start simple. Cover your basics and build from there. The complexities of life escape you if the basics aren't supplied. Homeless people don't ask for homes. They ask for food or money to fulfill the addictions that help them cope with things in the moment- and short term thinking probably contributed to the situation. All the worrying about the future is a way of avoiding the present, but you don‚Äôt have to dwell when you can deal. Things will happen. You will handle them the best you can as they do. That‚Äôs it. 
 
Step one is air. Forget the people and problems for a minute. Balance your pulse oximetry. Breathe deep, long, and to the point of pain. Shallow breathing comes with sustained stress and limits your functionality. Just flood yourself with oxygen for a few minutes and feel the difference. It's rather empowering. If you want to take a nap or curl up in a ball and cry after feeling that brief release, it‚Äôs fine. Just don‚Äôt forget that this is how you start and it will always work.

Next is to put the attempt to control your life and punish your perceived failings through diet to good use. Drink clean water- Brita filter, whatever. You don‚Äôt want the chlorine and contaminants from the treatment plant and the pipes clouding your blood and brain. Drink enough that your mouth doesn‚Äôt feel dry and your urine is light. Simple. 

Your diet is the most important factor in depression and stress. Caffeine, gum, diet anything, quick carbs, isolates and 'instant energy' stuff will ruin your ability to cope. Just look up some info on that if you're consuming any of it and draw your own conclusions. I‚Äôm an eating disorder body dysmorphic person myself, but if you're not getting enough calories or the right ratio, that 'starvation mode' thing contributes to the cycle of stress and endocrine dysfunction. All your switches flip to 'freak out'. You gain weight, retain water, and feel awful. Deficiencies make you depressed, and depression makes a Type A anxious. Stress can be the cause or effect of your issues, but it‚Äôs always the factor you want to cancel out as much as possible.

You need Vitamin D and K (1 and 2), A C and E, a complete B range with folic acid, a 2:1 ratio of Omega 3 to 6 and very well balanced electrolytes to overcome depression. Magnesium citrate powder is your best friend in stressful times- helps you think, move, sleep and shit. Literally. Green or white tea gets rid of excess fluid and clears your head without the highs and lows of coffee. Whatever your struggles with food and your body image, you can manage them over time- but your health cannot wait.  

You‚Äôre in a crisis. If the parents aren‚Äôt there for you, you have no choice but to be your own parent. Same for friends. The guilt that keeps you from relaxing and sleeping is useless. Control it or it controls you. All the pressure won‚Äôt go away, but by being aware of their impact you can change how well you process it. It‚Äôs great to set the bar high and have great expectations- you‚Äôre clearly brilliant and beautiful, but it's a terribly unfair and competitive world. You‚Äôve been driven to desperation by circumstances, many of which aren‚Äôt under your control. You are completely correct about the college problem, job market and economic situations. Those aren‚Äôt excuses- they‚Äôre realities and I‚Äôm sorry you were sold ideals that don‚Äôt pay off even though you measure up in every way. But you don't want to kill you- everything else does. Suicide starts to feel like an out, to stop the suffering and avoid more attacks from all sides. There is no easy out. Just a new start. 

Please stay in the gene pool. It needs people like you. I‚Äôm telling you this because I stressed and abused myself into a fatal autoimmune disease. After having been suicidal and self destructive for so long it‚Äôs sort of ironic that I try so hard to take care of myself now. I do it because there are things I want to finish, so my life meant something. That‚Äôs how I pay back the debt I owe to the very few who have supported me. Life is worth it for as long as you can take it, and it has whatever meaning you find. I think with some self-induced cognitive behavioral therapy (that is what I just introduced here) you can skip the suicide attempts, mental hospitals and misery. If those meds are helping, great, but remember that they don‚Äôt take themselves. You are helping yourself. You‚Äôre already self-reliant, and you will become more so with time and well-placed effort. It‚Äôs ok to decide you don‚Äôt want to feel bad anymore, and it is going to get better. 

*TL;DR To escape the stranglehold of anxiety, depression and guilt, think of what a supportive and loving parent would do for their child, then do exactly that for yourself.*",1392865336,"it‚Äôs great to set the bar high and have great expectations- you‚Äôre clearly brilliant and beautiful, but it's a terribly unfair and competitive world.","brilliant and beautiful","beautiful",NA,FALSE,"clearly brilliant and beautiful","brilliant",NA,"clearly",0

And recently I acquired Outlast. I can honestly say after playing all the way through Amnesia, the time I've put into Outlast really impressed me. The graphics for this game are absolutely gorgeous. And it's visual design is just great. The asylum is creepy as all fuck and they really set it up in a coordinated manner I guess, everything has a place and makes sense. The audio is creepy as fuck and is cue'd in perfectly. It enhances the atmosphere immensely but even though I've only put in a couple hours you can use the cues to your advantage and it feels like it takes away a piece of the challenge. The gameplay is great, though quite similar to amnesia without all the individual puzzles to complete, alot of it is just retrieve something, or turn on something. And I can see that getting old in the future. But it's also quite scary and tends to make you panic when the inmates follow you around while you do these parts. The camera mechanic is also quite neat. It works alot like the lantern from Amnesia but it almost works better because the static green is scary as hell to turn on, as opposed to a fire based light. I cannot really comment on the story as I haven't put in enough time to tell how good it is, but it seems quite promising. Overall, I'd give it a 8/10 and I would recommend picking it up even for full price, it's scary as hell but very immersive and fun to just set aside an afternoon to make progress in.

EDIT: I decided to add this section because I beat the game, and why not make some comments on the story and such. So after playing the whole game, and finally understanding the story; the developers did an amazing job of piecing together everything! It was slightly confusing and I had trouble understanding which characters are which or who some of them are but reading the notes and the documents really pieces together an unexpected story. And this all leads to an unexpected ending. But it doesn't feel crammed in, it's perfect honestly. You do one last retrieving mission with one of the scariest things chasing you around but it feels so good to beat it, and the ending is strangely satisfying. The only problem I kind of had with the story was after watching Grave Encounters, I wouldn't be surprised if they took a huge idea for the story from that game, it honestly felt like playing the movie a little bit, but they threw in some elements and areas that I didn't expect and it made this beautiful but horrifying atmosphere. After playing this I would bump the score, the beginning was cool but it felt alot like Amnesia and there is one point in the game that just shows you that the developers weren't fucking around and they really branched out from there. And it made this neat one of a kind experience that only eerily reminded me of Silent Hill. I would give this a 9/10, pick this up, and play the whole thing.

"cfamic0","‚ÄúNo, no, I don‚Äôt need that.‚Äù Ed‚Äôs wrinkled dimples cratered holding back a grin.

A furrowed brow and a pointed finger introduced a stutter into the small boy‚Äôs tantalizing voice. ‚ÄúBut- But it says- it says- um- says twenty-five cents there.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh I know what it says,‚Äù he let out a chuckle widening his gummy smirk, ‚ÄúIt can be our little secret, okay?‚Äù

The boy‚Äôs lips split into a smile to show off the few baby teeth he had left. He turned and ran away, each step showing appreciation. 

Under a sign reading Bluebrooke sat a man whose age was congruent to the population of the town. His figure stood lighter than what was left of his hair, and his honest grin illuminated the sign next to him that read, Happiness in Glass Bottles ‚Äì Twenty-five Cents. Ed sat in a small wooden chair matching the table in front of him. On top of the table rested 10 beautiful glass bottles, each with a handmade wax seal. Among the hollowness of the glass bottles lived an ethereal glow of sunshine- they type you can only imagine.

Every day Ed sat behind his table, smiling. Men and woman filled with emotion walked by every single day- some were stressed, mad, unhappy, and even jealous. Each man and woman strolling by took a glance at the bottles and was immediately intrigued, especially after reading Ed‚Äôs sign. The transaction was always consistent. While customers struggled through their pockets trying to find some loose change, Ed always smiled and said the same thing, ‚ÄúNo, no, I don‚Äôt need that.‚Äù The phrase alone lit a smile in the buyers face. They hesitantly took a bottle holding it more delicately than a newborn child.


It was Sunday. Ironic clouds concealed the sky in a blanket of grey. Ed still sat, smiling behind his table. It was a handsome, genuine smile, not to be confused with a phony, manikin-like expression.

A woman walked by. She didn‚Äôt stop, she didn‚Äôt speak to Ed, and she didn‚Äôt even glance.  Ed cleared his throat hoping to get her attention. She kept walking. He stood up never breaking his smile.

‚ÄúExcuse me, excuse me miss?‚Äù

The woman turned. Ed had never seen a woman like this. She was young and so beautiful, but sad. Her hair was made of the same clouds that overspread the sky. Her eyes looked like a midnight sky that was missing its stars. Her lips creased into a desolate smile. She continued to walk.

Day after day she walked by Ed. Every day he would try to do something to attract her attention. She never said a word. Eventually Ed started to line glass bottles up on the sidewalk where she walked. She weaved in and out of the bottles, purposely avoiding the kind glow through the glass bottles.

It had been several months of her walking by, and Ed trying and failing. After a while, he tried a different approach. 

Ed saw her again from a distance; he stood up, almost faking his smile now, and walked over to her holding two glass bottles. ‚ÄúHello, miss, I know you walked by yesterday, and the day before, and the day before that, and- well, you get the point. I just wanted to know if you wanted to buy one of my bottles.‚Äù She slowed her walk, almost stopping, but never turning around. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just- you‚Äôve never really seemed interested in buying one so I figured I would come up and offer one to you.‚Äù Her face was grey from the reflection of the clouds following her head. Ed almost lost his smile, ‚ÄúOh woops I said ‚Äòbuy‚Äô um that‚Äôs not what I meant. You can have it for free. I usually give them out for free anyway, and to be honest you don‚Äôt look too happy now, I think you could use one.‚Äù

The clouds surrounding her head and only her head began to darken, as if they were about to storm. Clouds rumbled and clapped, whispering comfort into her ears. Clouds and misery had invaded and manipulated her brain since she was a little girl. It‚Äôs all she ever knew and will ever know.

‚ÄúPlease,‚Äù Ed said, ‚Äúyou know this will be good for you.‚Äù She knew that. He broke the seal and extended the bottle closer to her. The ghostly luminosity arose from the bottle. ‚ÄúI promise you would feel better.‚Äù She knew that too.

Her head was encroached by subtle comfort from stormy weather and sadness. She lifted her head slightly and, for the first time, made eye contact with Ed. His eyes were so filled with life. They were screaming happiness at her with his hand still extended. She looked at the bottle and closed her eyes.

Ed tried to plead. ‚ÄúIt- it would make me feel better too. Both of us, right? Please.‚Äù He extended his hand further.

Eyes still closed, in one long breath, the woman finally spoke. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry.‚Äù

Ed dropped the bottle.

She walked away.

Ed‚Äôs smile evaporated into her clouds.

Here is the text:
Hope‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm sorry but I don‚Äôt want to be an Emperor ‚Äì that‚Äôs not my business ‚Äì I don‚Äôt want to rule or conquer anyone. I should like to help everyone if possible, Jew, gentile, black man, white. We all want to help one another, human beings are like that.

We all want to live by each other‚Äôs happiness, not by each other‚Äôs misery. We don‚Äôt want to hate and despise one another. In this world there is room for everyone and the earth is rich and can provide for everyone.

The way of life can be free and beautiful.

But we have lost the way.

Greed has poisoned men‚Äôs souls ‚Äì has barricaded the world with hate; has goose-stepped us into misery and bloodshed.

We have developed speed but we have shut ourselves in: machinery that gives abundance has left us in want. Our knowledge has made us cynical, our cleverness hard and unkind. We think too much and feel too little: More than machinery we need humanity; More than cleverness we need kindness and gentleness. Without these qualities, life will be violent and all will be lost.

The aeroplane and the radio have brought us closer together. The very nature of these inventions cries out for the goodness in men, cries out for universal brotherhood for the unity of us all. Even now my voice is reaching millions throughout the world, millions of despairing men, women and little children, victims of a system that makes men torture and imprison innocent people. To those who can hear me I say ‚ÄúDo not despair‚Äù.

The misery that is now upon us is but the passing of greed, the bitterness of men who fear the way of human progress: the hate of men will pass and dictators die and the power they took from the people, will return to the people and so long as men die [now] liberty will never perish‚Ä¶

Soldiers ‚Äì don‚Äôt give yourselves to brutes, men who despise you and enslave you ‚Äì who regiment your lives, tell you what to do, what to think and what to feel, who drill you, diet you, treat you as cattle, as cannon fodder.

Don‚Äôt give yourselves to these unnatural men, machine men, with machine minds and machine hearts. You are not machines. You are not cattle. You are men. You have the love of humanity in your hearts. You don‚Äôt hate ‚Äì only the unloved hate. Only the unloved and the unnatural. Soldiers ‚Äì don‚Äôt fight for slavery, fight for liberty.

In the seventeenth chapter of Saint Luke it is written ‚Äù the kingdom of God is within man ‚Äù ‚Äì not one man, nor a group of men ‚Äì but in all men ‚Äì in you, the people.

You the people have the power, the power to create machines, the power to create happiness. You the people have the power to make life free and beautiful, to make this life a wonderful adventure. Then in the name of democracy let‚Äôs use that power ‚Äì let us all unite. Let us fight for a new world, a decent world that will give men a chance to work, that will give you the future and old age and security. By the promise of these things, brutes have risen to power, but they lie. They do not fulfil their promise, they never will. Dictators free themselves but they enslave the people. Now let us fight to fulfil that promise. Let us fight to free the world, to do away with national barriers, do away with greed, with hate and intolerance. Let us fight for a world of reason, a world where science and progress will lead to all men‚Äôs happiness.

Soldiers ‚Äì in the name of democracy, let us all unite!

Look up! Look up! The clouds are lifting ‚Äì the sun is breaking through. We are coming out of the darkness into the light. We are coming into a new world. A kind new world where men will rise above their hate and brutality.

The soul of man has been given wings ‚Äì and at last he is beginning to fly. He is flying into the rainbow ‚Äì into the light of hope ‚Äì into the future, that glorious future that belongs to you, to me and to all of us. Look up. Look up.

"cenj947","&gt;A lot of people say that you should master vim first and then start expanding it with plugins, but yet nobody managed to explain to me why.

I've been reading along with this subreddit for a few years now. There have very often been new Vim users coming into here, StackOverflow, vim IRC channel, and other online help forums not knowing what's going on, and we have a hard time helping them, because they're using something like the Janus or Cream Vim distributions, which bundle in a ton of plugins. These newbs have no idea what's in Vim, and what's part of a plugin, and they never make any sense to us, and we have a hard time helping them.

Many of us started like this, and all of us - we experts - are constantly saying that starting with a bunch of plugins is a bad idea. We've all mostly backed away from them as we've improved, and wished we'd done so sooner. Some of us have spent a year or more with a mess of plugins, gotten fed up, and thrown everything out to start over fresh with a stock .vimrc and no plugins, and only added back in a few to smooth a few spots, learning each really well in the process.

I have 60 plugins (some are experiments I've been dabbling with), but I use - hang on... okay here's the list:

    # CONSTANTLY
    ------------

    powerline
    vim-gitgutter

At some point I thought each of these was cool. ""Experiments"" don't count - that's my crap. ""Color Stuff"" doesn't count - I'm not using any of those, save AfterColors (I use a modified Mint - modified after the fact via AfterColors, so that one really belongs in the ""Constantly"" section).

There are a few in the ""Never"" section I still wish I used, but I just don't need them. They include `nrrwrgn` - it's a very cool idea, like narrowing and widening in Emacs, `paredit.vim` - may use soon (learning Lisp), `easymotion` - another brilliant idea that I just don't ever need, and `vimroom` - so cool, but I always forget I have it.

The ""Rarely"" section has lots of great ideas - `bisect` I *asked* for years back (""is there a way to do this in Vim?""), but used less and less as I got better at stock Vim. `Ctrl-P` is well-loved by many, but it just doesn't mesh with how my brain works, or how my projects are set up. `gist-vim` - I make maybe 2 gists per year. `gitv` - beautiful, but more than I need for my rapid git work (fugitive's pretty perfect). `speeddating` - so powerful and great, never need it. `undotree` - I like it slightly better than `Gundo`, but never need them now - I've gotten good, and TDD helps, so I just don't go off on wild goose chases these days. I can't remember the last time I wanted something from another branch of my undo tree, but it was probably more than a year ago.

Things I use ""Sometimes"" include `abolish` - usually just `:S` to refactor varying capitalizations together, like `ActorThing` and `actor_foo` to `ModelThing` and `model_foo` in one shot in a whole file, or selected section of code. `buffergator` and `nerdtree` feel like the same thing for different lists, and I don't use them very much anyway (I use `&lt;Leader&gt;bg` and `&lt;Leader&gt;nt`, respectively, which touch-type very similarly, which I actually kinda like). `snipmate` - I just use `unit`, `test`, and `Test` for my Python test suite boilerplate, when I remember, because it's not much boilerplate anyway. `vimya` is very specific to my world - it lets me with 2 mappings send Python from the buffer or selection through a socket to Autodesk Maya, and I added the ability to send arbitrary code, which lead to many more mappings to control Maya directly - very cool, but only useful when I'm building in-Maya stuff. Often these days I'm building pipeline stuff separate from Maya, and that's all just stock Vim and Python (2.6) again, with a few plugins from lower down this list, especially `fugitive`.

Notably, everything in ""Often"" is by Tim Pope, god of Vim plugins. `Repeat` is passive, allowing dot-repeating for non dot-repeatable things, and I don't even know which things it's helping with anymore, but Vim got better when I added it. `Surround` is one of my favorite plugins ever - look into it. I use it like stock Vim now. `commentary` and `unimpaired` help with commenting code and turning settings on and off and flipping through various lists, like args/buffers/quicklist, and they're dead simple, which I require.

Three of the things in ""Constantly"" (1 of which is also by Tim Pope) are passive/always on, and great, and fugitive may be my favorite plugin of all time. It changed my life, and it's part of every project I've been on for about a year now.

So that works out to 8 plugins I use a lot from ""Often"" and ""Constantly,"" another 6 from ""Sometimes"" that I pull out once in awhile, and then I could probably skip all the others and not be too upset. In fact, this is inspiring me to gut my plugins directory finally. I'll probably cull just about everything below ""Rarely."" As I've laid off of plugins and moved more and more into learning core Vim (I'm 7 years in now, and have pretty much mastered all the standard stuff, and a ton of the less well-known stuff, like `g_` and `[count]|`) I've gotten even faster than I used to be. Stock Vim is a well-oiled machine, forged over more than half a century. It's about as efficient as it gets. The places where you should fill in are few (surround.vim) or new (ruby/rails helpers and `fugitive` e.g.). If you have a particular need, like you're always doing markdown, then look through what's available for that need (e.g. markdown.vim). Vim itself really doesn't need much beyond the enormous pile of things it already has. Learn those.

One last example to illustrate the point - I made myself a mapping to move the current split to its own tab. Then I found some plugin (I forget which one now) that did tab stuff, and it was mysteriously missing a way to do that, so I asked in an issue or email, and was told git already had that ability - `&lt;C-w&gt;T`. I started using that along with the other tab built-ins, removed my mapping, stopped needing tab plugins at all, and, as I got better at buffers, stopped feeling the need for tabs altogether. I never use them now. This was my journey for tabs, and it's been that for all the plugins that lie unused in my setup currently. I thought something sounded great, tried it out, thought it was cool, tried to insert it into my workflow, never managed to, got better at the stock Vim as a result (found the built-in ways, or composed my own), and stopped needing most of the plugins I installed. This has also been happening to my .vimrc. Over the holidays I pulled 100 lines out of it. It's now under 1000. I think I can shave another couple of hundred away, and I'm inspired to do so.

So that's why we suggest this. The way of Vim is not plugins. It's Vim. Get good at it, and you'll realize you don't need any plugins, or very, very few.",1389509948,"`ctrl-p` is well-loved by many, but it just doesn't mesh with how my brain works, or how my projects are set up. `gist-vim` - i make maybe 2 gists per year. `gitv` - beautiful, but more than i need for my rapid git work (fugitive's pretty perfect). `speeddating` - so powerful and great, never need it. `undotree` - i like it slightly better than `gundo`, but never need them now - i've gotten good, and tdd helps, so i just don't go off on wild goose chases these days.","beautiful, but more","beautiful","but",TRUE,"beautiful , but more","more",NA,NA,1

"ce2b2sa","Hm, I thought it was a really well-done survival thriller, and I mostly enjoyed the story, but I had a totally different problem with the movie. The space science stuff was bone stupid.  

* On-camera low gravity looks as good as any film ever made, including *2001: A Space Odyssey*. Cuaron managed to capture the feel and movement of people in zero gravity (actually microgravity), and make it look realistic and beautiful with only a few flubs (tears rolling down Sandra's cheeks... in reality tears just form blobs around your tear ducts unless you wipe or shake them away). So on a human scale the film looks really fantastic and beautiful, but... 

* The ISS International Space Station, the Hubble telescope, and a fictional Chinese space station are all in *exactly the same orbit*, about 10 kilometers apart. In reality, different satellites have radically different altitudes and orbits: the ISS orbits at an altitude of 260 mi, and an orbital inclination of 51.65 degrees; while the Hubble telescope is at 347 mi, and an orbital inclination of 28.5 degrees. It takes a massive amount of fuel and energy to go from the Hubble's orbit to the Space Station or back, and the idea that you could make the traverse in a space suit with a fire extinguisher is beyond ridiculous. Space, even low earth orbit, is a massive place and nothing is that close together. This isn't just wrong: it's childishly wrong and instantly robs the movie of its realism for most people who know anything about space travel (granted Buzz Aldrin liked the movie, but he's an advocate for NASA and the agency was heavily behind promoting the film as a bit of positive PR for the space industry).

* [The Kessler Syndrome](http://webpages.charter.net/dkessler/files/KesSym.html). The back-story of a Chinese missile destroying a satellite that creates a chain-reacting catastrophe that wipes out everything in earth orbit within a few hours is almost 100% Hollywood hooey. The actual Kessler syndrome, described here by Donald Kessler himself, has to do with the steadily increasing danger of orbital collisions where at some point the frequency of collisions creates a chain reaction that produces more collisions at an exponential rate. The point is, this process takes years to develop, or perhaps months in the case of a major catastrophic collision. The idea that the whole thing could unfold in a couple hours, leaving no time to even evacuate people, is silly. Secondly, most of the satellites likely to be destroyed this way orbit at the 500-650 mile level, way higher than the space station or the Hubble satellite. In the film, a huge number of fragments are on an orbit at the exact same altitude as the ISS and cross its path every 40 minutes or so. Again space is a big place, and the likelihood of this happening so quickly *by accident* is infinitesimally small.  

* Kowalski cuts the tether. This was the moment that pulled me completely out of the story and wouldn't let me back in. Watching George Clooney float away at 0.01 mph because he decided to sacrifice himself to save Sandra Bullock had me rolling my eyes so hard I needed an aspirin. Cuaron is stealing a storyline from the movie Vertical Limit, where mountaineer Chris O'Donnell lives with the guilt of having had to cut his father loose from a climbing rope (on his father's orders) to save himself and his sister. The cut-the-rope dilemma plays an important part in the plot of the movie. But that's a *mountainclimbing* movie. Mountainclimbing involves gravity, a continuous force that pulls you down against the tension of muscles and rope. But there's no gravity in Gravity... George and Sandra are drifting in inertia, and once they stop moving, there's no more force pulling George away. There's no reason to cut the rope.  

TL;DR - Gravity is beautiful but brain dead, much like my prom date. It won't stand the test of time, for the simple reason that it flubbed some pretty widely-understood facts about space travel. Apollo 13 remains the only film that portrays present-day space travel with any real accuracy.",1387128026,"cuaron managed to capture the feel and movement of people in zero gravity (actually microgravity), and make it look realistic and beautiful with only a few flubs (tears rolling down sandra's cheeks... in reality tears just form blobs around your tear ducts unless you wipe or shake them away).","realistic and beautiful","beautiful",NA,FALSE,"realistic and beautiful","realistic",NA,NA,0

I like listening to Neil DeGrasse Tyson and Stuff You Should Know podcasts, but there aren't a lot of other people who I can have a conversation with about these things.  Most people I know can discuss sports for hours, or drinking with their buddies, or tree-huggin-hippie-crap like their new taste-free rose petal salads.  So if I *am* able to discuss things that interest me, I'm usually teaching it to people who seem to be humoring me, instead of intelligently discussing it.  

*(don't get ahead of me, I did not have a conversation with someone who had the same interests I did and fall in love)*

While dating the woman who would eventually become my wife, we were having a conversation and I referenced some of my geekdom.  Specifically, chaos theory and how it's explained by Malcom in Jurassic Park (and you guys wonder how I stayed single for so long!)  Then we went onto discussing something else, then something else, and she brought the conversation full circle when she said something along the lines of...

""So basically this is what happens...like the chaos theory you were talking about""

That was when I knew.  We have completely opposite interests, but she understood me.  She heard what I said, and at the first opportunity where it was accurate, she applied what it.  That meant, to me, she was not only beautiful but smart, enjoyed knowledge, and was someone I could be myself around and not feel alone.

Now when I geek out, she takes it in, gives me a smile, tells me I'm cute, and points out that she already knows Leonidis is the same guy from The Phantom of the Opera.  I enjoy the musical, have seen it live several times, read about the making of the movie, casting choices, etc.  I knew they picked Gerard Butler and why.  I knew when they started filming 300, how effects heavy it would be, and how Snyder was going for a Miller-type comic feel, even the workout routine Butler was put through...

She simply recognized him.

The latter particularly will arrange all sorts of events for exchange students.

The UTA is awesome. Be sure to sign up immediately for 'Finnish 1' if you want a proper crack at learning the language. Make sure to take it with Heikki Kangasiniemi. Space is limited on those courses though, so make sure you sign up ASAP. An alternative would be 'Survival Finnish' which is very, very basic but which is a popular choice for exchange students. The language is beautiful but challenging. As you're likely aware, you can get by without it, but you should definitely take the initiative to at least learn some basics if you're interested!

Will you be staying in TOAS accommodation? Depending upon location (Lapinkaari, 'Toas City' aka Tuomiokirkonkatu) the accommodation will be inhabited exclusively by foreign/exchange students. It is tricky to meet Finns, but hopefully you'll have an assigned tutor (possibly a Finn?) who can help you meet Finnish students, too. Also consider joining 'Atalpa' the university's gym, and signing up for sports/classes. Finns are shy, but tend to  speak excellent English, so if you take the first step in interacting, you can surely make friends with students on your courses and such.

A cheap guitar can be purchased for 100 euros or less in Tampere; there are a few music shops around. One in Tammela I recall offhand is 'Tammer Piano' which can set up guitars, install pickups and the like. They do good work from what I've heard, but I've not had mine worked on there.

As others have mentioned, it will be cheaper to bring a jacket with you. You will definitely need one as well as gloves, comfortable layers, warm socks and likely a scarf and boots. It's a shame you're only staying until May... the last dregs of snow may not have fully melted before you leave.

"cdp6q45","I believe that Rarity's relative unpopularity is, at least for the older audience, due to that fact that Rarity superficially exhibits a lot of classically feminine traits, and that seems to get people all riled up for some reason. It's actually very interesting to contrast opinions of Rarity with opinions of Fluttershy, both of whom are the most classically feminine characters on the show, and yet stand at opposite ends of the popularity spectrum with bronies.

Rarity has, as you mentioned, a rather passionate view of beauty, exhibited in her work as a fashion designer. For some reason, people fail to see the difference between a portrayal of a strong entrepreneurial artist and the stereotypical 'girl obsessed with clothes', and leap on Rarity about it, as though by virtue of her art being *clothing*, Rarity is somehow reinforcing the stereotypes that her character exists to subvert. It's a bizarre reaction, especially considering how generally appreciative of art the community is, that there is the feeling that there is something wrong with art through fashion.

Fluttershy on the other hand is largely representing the 'meek, nurturing girl who must be protected' stereotype, but this is very rarely brought up against her, and she continues to be widely considered popular in the fandom. This is where I think your argument falters a bit, because Fluttershy is also (in- and out-universe) considered to be *very beautiful*, so your suggestion that ""People don't like Rarity because she's beautiful"" doesn't pan out. If that were the case, people wouldn't like Fluttershy either, yet they do.

I think, based on this contrast of these two characters, that the issue is that the (largely male) brony demographic generally receives Fluttershy better than Rarity due to the fact that the characteristics Fluttershy presents (and subverts...somewhat) are more appealing to male sensibilities. The 'passive girl who needs to be protected' is generally appealing, because it plays on the male 'desire to protect', whereas Rarity's active role in working on and towards making beautiful things is less appealing, because it doesn't play on any typical male desires.

They are both characters who represent classically feminine roles in positive ways. I think a lot of bronies tend to complain about Rarity (rather than Fluttershy) being a bad role model or what have you is simply because while both she and Fluttershy are there to tell young girls that it is okay to be classically feminine in some way, Fluttershy is classically feminine in a way that is appealing to men. She's beautiful, but meek. Nurturing, but compliant. Rarity on the other hand is imaginative and bold, while also being focused on aesthetics and clothing. 

If Rarity were an architect, or a sculptor, or a painter, she wouldn't receive nearly as much flak as she does, but nor would she be as effective a character. All of there possibilities, from architect to fashion designer, are professions which focus on making beautiful things to enrich society, and putting Rarity at the heart of the controversy makes her much more effective at sending girls the message that it is okay to like 'girly' things, it is about how you comport yourself that matters. The brony community, on the other hand, seems to have a number of members who seem to still be very leery about 'girliness', and insist on demanding that a stereotypical love of fashion is bad no matter what.

To summarize, I don't think it is as straightforward as ""Rarity has what everyone wants and that's physical beauty"" but rather that Rarity is reflecting a traditionally feminine desire and disposition that is not itself particularly appealing to a largely male audience.",1385677448,"she's beautiful, but meek.","beautiful, but meek","beautiful","but",TRUE,"beautiful , but meek","meek",NA,NA,1

"cdgng46","Hi there! I'm (super) new to this subreddit but find it super exciting! Here's my ""fuck regret"" story....

Christmas of 2011 I was at a small company gathering, just my team of 8 or so project managers were taken out to a fancy dinner with one of our executives. We decided to go around the table with different questions one of them being ""what do you regret not doing thus far?"" I might note here that most of these people are 10+ years older than me.   As we go around the table and everyone is saying what they regret, I notice a common theme... ""I wish I had traveled and experienced more in my 20's"" This was a HUGE ""Ah hah!"" moment for me. I was freshly 21 and had dreams of seeing the world but was already stuck in this boring routine of a desk job, dating a guy with kids, and just leading a very boring life. I had also been born and raised in my small hometown and had never left. I wanted and needed more out of life, and hearing others regrets was all it took.

6 months later I moved across the world by myself to be an Au Pair. I knew I wanted to travel, but I also knew I couldn't afford to just go see everything I wanted to see, I needed to have income while doing this. I had previous child care experience and becoming an Au Pair (nanny abroad) seemed like the best way to make this happen. I found a family,  we had multiple skype conversations and tons of emails before everything was finalized. I sold everything I owned (enough to furnish a 2 bed 2 bath home) including my car. I packed the next year of my life into two suitcases and left my entire family, all my friends, and boyfriend of 2 year behind. I was ready to take on the world.....literally. 

If I haven't mentioned it already I moved to Switzerland. An amazing beautiful but VERY expensive country. I hit a lot of road bumps in my year abroad. I was very homesick and lonely. I didn't have the best host family, the kids barely spoke any English and the dad was a prick. I was sick for 8 months straight, diagnosed with 5 ear infections and bronchitis 4 times. I later found out after some routine blood work when I got home that I had mono that whole time... damn Swiss doctors didn't figure that one out. But inspite of these road bumps I made sure to make the most of my time in Europe. 

I was able to travel a lot! I saw 10 countries, many I was able to see multiple cities in each country. I learned enough French to get around. I made countless new friends and connections all over the world. I snowboarded in the Swiss, French, and Italian Alps. I went canyoning, paragliding, and bungee jumping. (http://youtu.be/PwhG4mZ9VtQ) I was able to experience new cultures first hand and learn a ton!

It was a year I will never forget and always be thankful for. I'll never be satisfied when it comes to traveling, I'll always want to do and see more, but what I have done has benefited my life immensely. I'm so glad I was able to take others regrets and turn them into a positive for my own life.

"cdcc5em","I think the sound at the start of DYSTW and at the end of Turn Into Something are similar, they are both peaks of musical genius, in their harmonies, and they make feel damn awesome. There are other moments like this of course, Banshee Beat's ""I duck out...swimming pool,"" almost all of Purple Bottle (I love the live version so much), and those moments in Grass, but I think the spontaneous burst of emotion in DYSTW is resolved in Turn Into Something. As I read it, DYSTW is about heartbreak/young love, we hear the speaker amidst his complicated inner monologue, where the thoughts are erratic to us but familiar to him. Turn Into Something is a comparison between the speaker's mother and his lover, both urging him to ""turn into something."" It's a closure to the album in the form of the speaker choosing to live in these moments, these 'feels,' and appreciating them rather than moving past them. So, the album ends in a sound that is the epitome of a beautiful, but brief, moment. 

Feels is definitely my favorite album, Avey's writing was so unrestricted and honest. Also, the cover is an old child education guide Avey found on the street, which could easily symbolize the contradiction of a guide for childhood, an attempt to structure something that is filled with spontaneous emotion, misery, ecstasy, everything on the emotional spectrum.

""My son will hunt you down and kill you for the wrong you have caused.""
The loser said between breaths,  some of his last.  ""My son will...""  He finally had bled enough to be silenced forever.

The surviving combatant kicked the now lifeless corpse off of his blade, a nasty looking zwihander with spikes near to the hilt.  The killer looked into the shadows where the new orphan was hiding.  Before retreating into the night, he quickly spat:

""Don't come after me.  You won't get a chance to live.""

The boy, Rallis, started training with his father's sword the day after the funeral.  Everyday he would practice in a field until he could barely move.  He imagined the demon who took away his father being cleaved in half by his mighty swings.  The murderer would be brought to justice, of that Rallis was certain.

There came a day when Rallis was thought to be the best swordsman in his village.  Rumors spread about the man who could hack trees into stumps in seconds.  These rumors drew the attention of a very skilled swordsman from the East.  The swordsman decided he would test the skills of ""Treeslayer"".

Rallis was out in his field hacking away at a large oak when the swordsman finally found him.  

""Ah you are swinging too wide!"" teased the old veteran, ""you'll never win in a fight against a *real* foe.""

""Oh?  And I suppose that you are that foe?"" Rallis retorted.

""Come at me and you'll find out.""

The two squared off.  Rallis attacked first, missing by a foot he swung again at the spot where the old man used to be standing.  Rallis heard a smarmy laugh before he was knocked unconscious.

When he awoke, Rallis grabbed at the painful lump on his head.

""I guess I'm not as good as my friends tell me.""

The old man said:  
""I'll teach you how to be as good as me if you desire,  but it will take a lot of time, more than the day's light has to offer.""

Rallis didn't care,  after all he had been doing just that for the past seven years.  ""What do I have to lose?""
.
.
.

It took month's before Rallis could fight his master for more than a minute, years before he could stand toe to toe, and years more before he could finally best him.  Then it happened.  Rallis was in the big city when he spied a familiar face.  He had found the man who robbed him of his only family.  He shouted at that cur, that swine who could murder a man without so much as a moment of regret *in* *front* *of* *a* *child*;

""YOU""!

The man stared at him for a moment,  trying to figure out who this angry looking stranger was before he realized.  Rallis could see the man's face fill with horror,  that agonizing horror when you know retribution is stampeding your way.  The man sprinted off though the alleyways with Rallis thundering close behind.  The chase was short lived when the vile snake darted into a doorway.  Rallis heard the sound of locks clicking on the door, the oak door, or rather: the ex-door.  Rallis stepped over the splinters of his prey's last defense.  Then the man said, ""I knew you wouldn't listen to me!  You foolish boy!"" then he drew his spiked sword and the two began to fight.

Rallis attacked first,  swinging with raw fury.  The two blades finally were reunited; sending sparks to brighten the poorly lit room for a brief moment each time the two swords connected.  The two combatants where locked in that beautiful but deadly dance, each trading hits and parrying almost like they rehearsed this glorious battle.  Then there was a moment where Rallis saw a chink in his foe's defenses.  In that one moment Rallis already knew he had won, a fact made evident by the blood that splattered in his face.  

Rallis had done it!  He gained justice for his father's early grave!  Rallis happily hollered in victory,  but stopped when he heard his enemy begin to utter his last words.

""You, fool..."" coughed the bleeding man,  ""My...  Son... Will Not... Let this go without revenge...""

Rallis felt the chills crawling up his spine like spiders when he heard those words.  Then he looked around the broken hut.  in the corner, covered with blood, was a child.  Rallis looked at him for a moment before saying:

""Don't come after me.  You won't get a chance to *live*.""

"cdc9xsa","I don't recall reading much about signaling. Most of what I've learned has come from experience and intuition. It's pretty simple to figure out what a girl's motivation is by just putting yourself in her shoes. 

Imagine you were a beautiful but somewhat shy and passive person. You have inherent value for just being yourself, but you don't have the balls to take what you want. What would your strategy be for getting what you want while filtering out what you don't want? It would mostly consist of coming up with ""excuses"" to interact with the person you want, hoping you can convince them to want you, and coming up with quick and painless tactics for not interacting with the person you don't want.

If they look away quickly with a disinterested look, then it means they are trying to give you the signal that they aren't interested. This doesn't necessarily mean they aren't interested, only that they will make things difficult for you.

If they look down or away shyly or looking embarrassed, it means you are making them nervous and self-conscious, which is usually a good thing. 

If they maintain eye contact and have a positive facial expression, then it means they are open to meeting you.

I don't know, what do you think?

&gt;....further stereotypes, especially that women are meant to be beautiful and admired, that women are teases, etc.

well, we are beautiful. But what I'm wondering though is the treatment of women in society based on stereotypes or is it because of patriarchy? 

I'm being downright honest when I say the way men and society treat and expect women to act can be really upsetting. being cat called, hit on, treated like I'm fragile, unabashed comments about my body, expectation to wear makeup at work, pressure to wear heels in professional settings, judgements for being assertive and not submissive, etc. I feel like I could go on for days. 

I feel like I might have gotten off topic but it just really confuses me and I'm not proud to admit submitting to some of those expectations. When I've complained to other women I get a ""welcome to womanhood"" speech and get handed a glass of wine. 

So, yeah, I think Burlesque is awesome even if only for the downright open challenge to social expectations and celebration of femininity. 

good luck at your show! you'll have to let me know how it turns out.

Paternalism, noble savage, appropriation, hegemony, stereotypes, and caricatures all come to mind when thinking of orientalism. The West assumes that all other societies share certain negative characteristics that the West does not. Sometimes this otherness is fascinating and beautiful, but through the lens of orientalism it exists for Westerners to appreciate and utilize. Like a raw material, the cultural and artistic aspects of the other need the shaping by Western hands to reach their full potential. Explorations of non-Western societies are presented in a way that reaffirms the correctness of Western perspectives and practices rather than providing a full and complex understanding of a way of life. As /u/Ortus said, one way to judge whether something is orientalist is to see whether the representation of the other is as props to transmit the author/filmmaker's points or full and interesting characters with internal lives of their own.

I'm 20, and I'm hoping I'll live for another 80 years with the advancements medicine will make, but on the other hand we really don't know how long we have.

I think every human's purpose here is to better humanity.  Yes it's an idealist view, but imagine 7 billion unified people?  Humanity is such an amazingly unique and accidental gift full of love, hope, and mystery.

Maybe I'll only help a friend through their struggles.  Maybe later in life I'll help lay down the foundations for colonizing another planet?  I think both are just as amazing and wonderful as the other.  I accept that I'll die at some future point, it's inevitable for all of us.  This surety eases my mind.  I'm comforted by the fact that it's never too late right now to right wrongs, to try something new, to be adventurous, to be bold, to leap without looking.

Read this thread. Read the absolute repulsion people have when they talk about overweight human beings. Even you are saying that we shouldn't treat them as beautiful because they aren't willing to change, implying that they can't be amazing unless they get skinny.

There's nothing wrong with being fat any more than there's anything wrong with being a smoker or liking to drink or liking to skydive. These are all harmful, dangerous activities that will increase your health premiums. They are all things that Americans have the right to do.

The core message of fat acceptance is not to demand to be called beautiful, but to stop calling them ugly solely because they're fat. Stop assuming you know a damn thing about them.

Stop walking up to them and telling them they should lose weight, because you have no right to judge them.

They just want to live their lives without constantly being harassed that they need to change. If they do or don't want to get skinny, that's a choice between them, their families, and their doctor.

Being overweight has nothing to do with anything except the percentage of fat on your body. It doesn't have anything to do with whether or not they're amazing. That kind of mentality is exactly what they're fighting against.

Yes, there are nutjobs who are arguing being fat is better and skinny is wrong and a lot of other bullshit. But every message and every idea has extremists who take it too far. But the core of fat acceptance is a very understandable and human one:

""I'm overweight. I understand that I'm overweight. I don't need you to tell me I'm overweight.

There's lots of stuff GNOME developers are working at the moment (many of them are going to be landed in GNOME 3.10); HiDPI, CSD, Wayland support, ostree, freedesktop.org application installer, sandboxing, etc. All those technologies and features are going to be available for Cinnamon, elementary and many other desktops automatically.

Your show, your way - but I'm still a little disappointed a way how GNOME is presented sometimes. It gets criticism from the exact same things some other DEs get praises.

"cbo5h5e","I'm fine with ethical adoption. My concern is that the adoption industry has a long, dirty, nasty history of coercing and flat-out stealing babies from vulnerable single young women. This stuff still goes on, adoptions agencies have been accused of paying people in developing countries to give up their children and other shady shit like that. I'm a fan of encouraging open adoptions and arrangements such as taking in the young mother AND the baby, help her raise her own child. A closed adoption is okay if the mother 100% wants it, but they have been associated with mental health issues for both the mothers and infants, so they should be considered extremely carefully. 

And that's not even touching on how biological fathers have trouble protecting their rights when it comes to adoptions (and any pregnancy not between a married man and woman, really).

Your mom sounds as though she dealt with it VERY well, both rationally and human. That is a special balance and it is so wonderful that you both have one another.



I wouldn't wish death or illness on anyone, but I must say your cousin seems to have gotten back some, if not all, of the bad that he put into the world. That is another special balance.



Also, your last paragraph here is spot-on. Though I have never experienced sexual abuse or physical, my sister and I were neglected by our mentally-ill mother and grew up in filthy homes. We slept on towels and would pick through a pile of dirty clothing every morning before school, smelling each article to find the least putrid in hopes that our peers might not notice. For very long I thought I deserved this, and that i didn't deserve the necessities that all my friends at school seemed to take for granted. 

When i got older and made real friends, i started to confide in them. This saved my life. I truly believe that. I lived a lie for so long and blamed myself for what was happening to my family, on the inside and outside. I would be a completely different person today if i had kept my past to myself.

Let's say you're planning to visit some beautiful but obscure attraction.

You go up to them and say, ""Hey, I was wondering if you know how to get to [beautiful but obscure attraction].""  They've never heard of it, so you wax rhapsodic about how you've wanted to see this for years and how Alexander the Great blah blah blah.  Then you thank them and turn and walk away!

Then of course, you get two feet away and you turn and say, ""Do you guys want to go too?""  (Say ""guys"" -- if you say ""girls"" or ""ladies"", you'll just sound creepy.)  And boom!  50% of the time, it works every time.

And if you aren't planning to visit some beautiful but obscure attraction?  Well, why aren't you?  Even if you aren't, it isn't like they can check.  Just read your damn guidebook and find some stuff.

"cb91jcr","Torrent sites(pirate Byran aye!) are based on and inspired from bittorrent, the first p2p file-sharing app to use the BITTORRENT protocol.  One brilliant guy thought python and gtk were cool enough and easy enough to create something truly innovative which inspired others to copycat it using other toolkits.  For this guy, python and gtk were more in line with his thought process.  Perhaps others have realized javascript killer apps, but none of the killer apps in the past 15 years have involved javascript unless you like node.js.  Performance wise, node.js certainly draws a lot of attention, but with respect to reliability, security and long-term maintenance, it's still too early to conclude.  QT is a mature technology in its pure-c++ toolkit form.  QML and it's embedded javascript  are immature technologies.  I am shocked to see every major GUI toolkit adopting it as part of their long-term strategy.  You shocked me with GNOME making javascript its main language.  That makes GNOME just as bad as QT now.   When a programmer writes a GUI, it is deliberately not to write something dynamic and changing at runtime.  A GUI is meant to reflect something that we are used to seeing in a paper format usually.  For example a newspaper has been replicated in electronic format as a PDF document being as faithful as it can to its original printed form.  Many people feel this is best considering our ability to refer to pages and paragraphs when speaking about certain parts of texts.  When dealing with html5 hypertext links everywhere with a similar referential ability via id attributes, it makes challenges for archiving our history because html pages change so much and disappear or get censored everyday.  Books are archived in libraries and we hope they last forever or at least longer than any of these crappy reddit blogs spewing propaganda, mind control, and in-place targetted ads.

It is true source code is not for the general populace.  It is meant for those with a passion for reading code and wanting to do something with the code.  Assembly is beautiful but verbose.  C when I first encountered it after learning assembly was elegant and reflected everything assembler was.  It mapped it one-to-one and made it less verbose.  Other languages also came into play before and after C, but for reasons of merit, C++ is C's successor as everyone knows and it continues even to this day.  C++ is core to X/GTK/KDE/QT infrastructure.  Other languages boast forcing compile-time deliberation(are you really sure you want to do that?), high-reliability, fault-tolerance, elaborate concurrency syntax, security and long-term maintenance at the expense of a longer learning curve.  I would have agreed with the GNOME/KDE/UNITY if they decided to integrate such a higher-level language into the infrastructure, but JAVASCRIPT is not that kind of language.  From what I understand swig generates corba/rpc like interface marshalling code allowing other languages to talk with C/C++ apis.  i.e. perl, python, go, java all have the ability to use gtk.  Node.js does something similar but targetting only the webserver/headless stuff talking via web browsers(essentially thin clients).   The main language for the GUI toolkits are C/C++ not javascript.  Javascript does not map 1:1 with machine architectures and there is nothing in the language intended for that.  When it was first used, it was but a toy and it crapped and caused errors in the web browser all the time.  I still get annoying javascript messages.  Web browsers are a FAT-client application dedicated to reading hyper-media. That's all.  It was never intended for everything to be integrated into the web-browser.  It was never intended for the web-browser to become a constrained operating system.
Having every gui being written in javascript/html5 makes me sick.  Native apps are more than web browser pages.  They contain custom controls never intended for web browsers.  It's like all the marketers out there are saying here is qt/qml/html5/javascript or gnome/html5/javascript, your new hammers, now go hammer some nails into your new apps.  Not everything merits to be in a web-browser.  Not everything merits to use javascript.  Start using javascript and gui-performance will drop compared to non-javascript gtk or non-javascript qt.

I like go-gtk.  I'll be starting to use that because I am thoroughly impressed with the golang.  Golang is not intended for the same embedded into webpage as javascript is, but it certainly is powerful in other ways and with go-gtk, golang is no longer constrained to the server-side of apps.  Golang can be used to make FAT-Client GUIs(even a web-browser) or standalone GUIs.  Somebody is actually trying to integrate golang with qt/qml, but it turns out it's rather complex to do that.  That in itself is a hint that qt/qml is too complex to maintain and use.  Don't be fooled by all this QT/QML hype.  GNOME/GTK/KDE without javascript still has a place to thrive and fork from when all this QT/QML maintenance and testing mess hits the fan.

I continue to be impressed with the quality of the images I get from crop sensors. The only two reasons that seem attractive to me about full frame is the improved low light performance, and shallower depth of field at the same aperture. However these issues are still less important to me than size and cost, which is why I stick with crop.

I can't say I am not impressed with full frame. My brother has a Canon 6D and it is very nice.

Actually it was my last day there, after 3 months backpacking. My belly had been through it all, but yep, last day, risked it one more time and ate the wrong thing.

So I get to the airport busting, almost making a big mess of myself, but have the knowledge that inside is a haven of International Airport cleanliness and privacy I had seldom seen in all these months. Even though I'm getting the gurgles, the cramps, the tightening of the anus, the perspiration on the forehead, everything, I feel happy handing over my boarding pass to be let in. The guard says 'No. You cannot come in for one hour, your flight isn't for 6 hours.' I feebly try and convince him but I'm just so close to bursting I let out a defeated sigh and ask him where a bathroom is. He frowns, and points to a big construction site about 200m away. ""There it was, new one going there"". I actually start laughing at this, I've been through heaven and hell in this country, beautiful but difficult and wild and frustrating. So, I kid you not when I tell this next part. I grab my bag, walk down to the construction site, in front of.. I dunno, a thousand people. I walk in to the middle, behind a wall, cover myself up as best I can and I painted that motherfucker from floor to ceiling. Public squatting, thankfully isn't *that* weird down there, but it certainly is for a tourist. And man, I went for it. The smell was an abomination - I have smelled burning piles of rancid trash being used to cook rotting goat stew, and my creation smelt many times worse.

"caj71hk","The solution is several little things, not one single thing.

It comes down to having to change your whole outlook on her and the relationship you have with her.

For starters, I find it helps to not idealize a girl.  If you feel like a girl is super beautiful and perfect in every way, then you're going to be constantly reminding yourself of all the reasons she might not want to be with you.  But, if you can put things in perspective, and realize that this girl is actually just one of millions of potential girls you could be with, a girl who farts and sometimes says stupid things and sometimes has bad hair days, then at that point you can relate to her more as a fellow human being and an equal, rather than a mythologized creature of staggering beauty.

Also, a lot of this has to do with trust.  Rationally, you realize that she's a girl, and that every other guy in the world who looks at her will find her roughly as attractive as you do.  But, there's an irrational part of you that wants to believe she lived her whole life ignoring boys until you came along.  It really doesn't matter that others guys find her attractive, or even if she finds other guys attractive.  If you trust her, then jealousy is easier.  I'm sure you **think** you trust her, but a huge part of jealousy is lack of trust, so it's clear to me that you don't completely trust her, whether you'd agree with me on that or not.

Last, sometimes jealousy is a pain in the ass, but if you look at the much bigger picture, it's kind of a sweet pain the ass.  You could not be jealous unless you had some feelings for her, and the more intense your jealousy is, the more intense your feelings for her must be.  While the jealousy is unpleasant, remember that it springs from something that IS very pleasant, which is how good she makes you feel.  There's no magic wand to make it go away, but, there's also nothing stopping you from realizing that it's all a part of your story with this girl, and if you like the whole experience of being with her, then liking that experience has to include accepting the fact that it's not all pleasant.  

We live, and life is beautiful, but we die too, and death can be bitter.  But when you add it all up, it's more than worth it.  So, don't get too focused on trying to root out the parts of it you don't like or find less pleasant.  Instead, look at the whole thing and realize that big picture wise, you're lucky.  In other words, give yourself a license to feel a bit of jealousy from time to time, and don't make it worse by torturing yourself about it.

I'm sorry, but I don't want to be an Emperor, that's not my business. I don't want to rule or conquer anyone. I should like to help everyone if possible, Jew, gentile, black man, white. We all want to help one another, human beings are like that. We all want to live by each other's happiness, not by each other's misery. We don't want to hate and despise one another. In this world there is room for everyone and the good earth is rich and can provide for everyone.
The way of life can be free and beautiful. But we have lost the way.

Greed has poisoned men's souls, has barricaded the world with hate; has goose-stepped us into misery and bloodshed.

We have developed speed, but we have shut ourselves in;
machinery that gives abundance has left us in want.
Our knowledge has made us cynical,
our cleverness hard and unkind.
We think too much and feel too little.
More than machinery we need humanity,
more than cleverness we need kindness and gentleness.

Without these qualities life will be violent and all will be lost.

The aeroplane and the radio have brought us closer together. The very nature of these inventions cries out for the goodness in men, cries out for universal brotherhood for the unity of us all. Even now my voice is reaching millions throughout the world, millions of despairing men, women and little children, victims of a system that makes men torture and imprison innocent people.

&gt;but I'm not objecting to the word in any blanket, absolute sense. I just think people throw it around far too casually, where it doesn't apply, and I think the impact of this is greater than just an engaging discussion of semantics

This is a very good point.

&gt;But this is not the definition of misogyny - I feel you are moving the goalposts.

According to my dictionary, misogyny is ""*n. hatred or distrust of women.*""

Now, I realise I'm getting all semantics on our asses, but bare with me. That's obviously a basic toned down definition, but it could easily be said that misogyny is ""*a prejudicial view of women*"" for the purposes of argument.

In that sense, viewing women as ""less than men"", less fit, or less useful is exactly what misogyny means.

Misogyny isn't even something that's exclusive to men:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internalised_misogyny

^ This is common in countries around the Middle East, where women view *other* women as property and less-than or as something of less worth than men.

This is of course at one end of the spectrum; what is described there is *explicit* or *open* misogyny, and does often happen and is easily identifiable.

What we're discussing is the complete opposite end of the spectrum. *Implicit* misogyny, where it's not openly stated, but subtly implied. A subtle implication of misogyny (and I do think it is misogyny) can take many forms; a comment made on YouTube, to a joke between colleagues at the workplace, and even a funny sex pun on reddit. 

Do I think we should *attack* anybody who makes those jokes? No.

I just think it's important to be able to identify extremely subtle implications of sexism when it does happen...

&gt;I reject the notion that heterosexual people of either gender don't naturally notice the physical sexual qualities of those around them as a matter of course. Being viewed sexually isn't the problem. Asking someone to display their parts for the gratification of others in order to be allowed to participate in a non-sexual discussion is the problem.

I'd argue that women are on the receiving end of these attitudes more often than men are...

I can't remember ever reading a YouTube comment that said ""Dick or GTFO""... ^^Not ^^that ^^that's ^^never ^^happened ^^although ^^it ^^was ^^probably ^^posted ^^ironically ^^if ^^it ^^did.

Especially on the internet, I'm fairly sure that women's bodies are sexualised more often than men's. A topless woman is seen as being much more *sexual* than a topless man.

A woman in a science fiction themed costume is far more likely to receive comments of a sexual nature (albeit, mostly harmless jokes/puns) than a man in the same sci-fi themed costume.

&gt;Yes, if something is misogyny, we should call it that. I don't agree that sexism is inherently misogynistic (most especially subtle sexism, where someone believes themselves to be being flirtatious or complimentary).

This is a fair point... though I wasn't actually arguing that sexism itself is inherently misogynistic, just that misogyny could pretty much just be called a synonym for ""sexism against women"", unless ya'll *really* want to get into semantics.

I think that flirts and compliments *can* be forms of misogyny. For example:

""*You're so smart AND beautiful, you don't see that much with girls!!*""

^ This is obviously a compliment... but it has the somewhat problematic subtle implication that a woman can only be smart OR beautiful, but can rarely be both.

""*I hate it when girls wear too much makeup! It makes them look so ugly. What guy would want to date that?*""

Sound advice! ... 'cause the *only* reason girls wear makeup *ever* is to attract boys, right?

""*I'll bet you make great sandwiches, real wife material.*""

^ Alright, so I put that last one in as a joke.

&gt;And most importantly (as this is the biggest reason for my ire at seeing this word thrown around so casually), how can the source of a comment possibly make misogynistic comments and not be a misogynist?

Same way a person can make a homophobic comment and not themselves be homophobic or have anything against gay people.

e.g. ""*Boy, I wish that guy wouldn't flaunt the fact that he's gay so much. We get it, jeez...*"" - this could be said by anyone from an explicit homophobe to a person with ""many gay friends"" who openly supports same-sex marriage.

Most sexist comments aren't coming from people who are openly and explicitly sexist; they're just sentiments that we learn from cultural conditioning (like the idea that a woman without a shirt is more sexual than a man without a shirt).


&gt;But if the same thing happens and someone calls me a misogynist, my reaction is to be nothing but perplexed, and possibly a bit angry. I whistled in appreciation, as a complement, and now you are telling me that you have concluded from that action that I must hate, mistrust, or dislike women? No.

This is a fair point. *People* don't need to be misogynist for their actions to be...
Rather than ""You're a misogynist"", a more appropriate response would be ""*That's* a bit sexist"", because you should be criticising the action, not the person who happened to do it. A popular term for these kinds of incidents that reinforce archaic attitudes without explicitly meaning to is ""microagression"".

http://www.microaggressions.com/

^ This is an excellent site that lists tonnes and tonnes of real life examples of microagressions.

Having been the victim of many microagressions (but never having a word for it) as an LGBT individual, they are extremely frustrating to be on the receiving end of, especially when the person speaking has made it *crystal clear* they're not a homophobe.

No one facet of society is responsible for misogyny or microagressions; it's just an ingrained cultural idea, a set of attitudes, with no one *person* or event responsible. As long as people are being extremely critical of those ideas and attitudes when they see them, and calling people out on BS, then progress should happen.

It doesn't mean that the whistling isn't a manifestation of the misogynist idea of women being inherently more *sexual* beings than men (this is a pretty far reaching attitude in modern society, examples of which you can see in the idea that women shouldn't wear revealing clothing if they don't want ""attention"", or that breastfeeding in public is taboo because *FEMALE NIPPLES WUT*, even though breastfeeding is hardly sexual.)

&gt;So it appears, to me, in most cases, that people pull that word out because it somehow carries more weight. It's the nuclear option with regard to expressing your disapproval towards how a man has behaved towards a woman.

This is why I think the taboo and supposed ""heavy handedness"" attached to the word should be removed, because all that does is give people an excuse to deny that what they said could be called misogynist (which for some, is the hardest thing in the world). e.g. ""What I said *can't* be misogyny because I'm not a *misogynist*! I love girls!"" ^^and ^^the ^^sandwiches ^^they ^^make!

*Fear of a name only increases fear of the thing itself*, and will stifle discussion or criticism because people equate the word ""misogyny"" with ""modern Nazism"" and ignore anything else said as a result.

&gt;I very rarely take the time to comment on this when I see it. But I very, very rarely see the word used in discussion forums or other online discourse in a way that makes me say, ""Why yes, that scoundrel does indeed hate, mistrust, or dislike women. Well said!"".

Like I said above, misogyny can't tangibly be tied to a person (outside of extreme cases where someone thinks women shouldn't have a right to decide when they should reproduce or not).

What is sexism aimed at women if it's *not* a hate, mistrust, dislike or prejudicial attitude towards them?

Going out of our way to police the use of the word ""misogyny"" will only increase fear of discussing the actual topic of misogyny... *Fear of a name*.

&gt;Hmm. I wouldn't be quite so sure. Unless you use hash marks you'll probably lose count. ;-) http://www.reddit.com/r/doctorwho/comments/1dqjcp/my_11th_doctor_72_cosplay/

... That is indeed one handsome man.

A debatable topic (though... can we not? I'm getting carpal tunnel) would be whether it is misogyny to comment that ""I'd like the key to that TARDIS"" (it could be argued that it's implying the costume has *made* her into the object) and whether its comparable to call it misandry to simply call a man attractive.

I would call it misogyny to imply that a woman *is* her costume, especially when such a costume is a machine or object, which can be accessed with a key. ^^^penis ^^^^lol ^^^^jk.

Again, those are debatable topics, but I don't feel qualified to discuss them (though I'd certainly be interested in reading about it).

This wouldn't have ever been called misogynistic if the comment had simply been ""She looks so pretty!""

&gt;(And I would really like to think that as a woman I could handle the Tardis-key comment as well -- I could surely see my wife and other women I'm close with thinking it was funny or at least being flattered. I can't actually picture any of them saying ""You won't believe what someone on reddit said to me today!!! How dare he comment on my attractiveness with a Tardis-related reference!"")

I've laughed at homophobic jokes at my expense... Does that stop them being homophobic, or microagressive?
No... Does it mean we couldn't discuss the unfortunate implications of said joke? Of course not.

I MADE IT TO THE END, THAT TOOK 2 HOURS OF ON-AND-OFF WRITING.

"c9mync2","I'm not Iranian (I'm Yemeni, hahah), but I grew up in and still live with a Muslim family, although I no longer believe in it.  In my experience a lot of veiled Muslim women like pictures like this because it's a simple, albeit distasteful, metaphor for one of the things the veil means to them.

When I went to an Islamic Sunday School in my youth the teachers usually avoided explicitly saying that not wearing a veil will cause harm, but they implied it strongly.  I think that using wrapped candy as an example of a veiled woman is their idea of a positive metaphor.  They're saying that the woman is something good, and that men (flies) will flock to her if she doesn't keep herself protected - because she's so good.  That was a common theme in the classes I went to, rather than using negative examples (ie: you need to cover yourself because if you don't you'll be attacked), positive examples were, understandably, better received.

The basic idea is that as a woman, you're precious.  You're beautiful but also fragile, the veil is a protection against being hurt because it keeps men from being so attracted to your beauty that they're tempted to harm you.  Something else I heard often was that the veil allows women to be more free and independent, because people then judge them for their words and actions, their intelligence, rather than their appearance.

The underlying, more negative reasoning is that men in Islamic teaching basically have little control over their desire.  Women, beautiful as they are, have so much allure that they can't help themselves from wanting to assault them if they're attracted.  Women have more control over their desires (in some circles, women aren't believed to have *any* sexual desire), so it falls on them to take responsibility for their appearance and for men's inability to control themselves.

So billboards like this are a subtle(ISH) way of saying, ""you're as desirable as a delicious piece of chocolate, so much so that if you don't protect yourself you'll be assaulted.""

"c9muwy1","I seem to be one of the few Western ladies here currently in a serious relationship with a Japanese guy, so I guess I'll throw my 2 cents in.

I've met plenty of Western women who are interested in dating Japanese men, but they lament that they're never approached. I've met a few J-guys with a white girl fetish, but I've met more guys that say they'd never consider a gaijin woman and even Japanese girls who have been abroad and ""act foreign"" are unappealing to them. I have a few female Japanese friends who are smart, funny, and beautiful but they struggle to find dates because they're too ""internationalized"". 

As for Western ladies, I think the problem is that they're generally not approaching dating ""the Japanese way"". Foreign guys can typically ignore the rules and directly ask a girl, but directness from women isn't usually well received (in my experience). You have to meet people through other people, hint at your intentions properly, speak pretty decent Japanese, and ""act Japanese"" to some degree. If you don't, then you're limited to only guys who have lived abroad. 

Plus, I've observed that Western women in Japan don't put nearly as much effort into their appearance compared to Japanese girls. And even most of the Japanese girls I meet lament that finding a boyfriend in Japan is hard. So Western ladies are competing for J-guys with girls who will spend tons of hours and money into their looks and are desperate for boyfriends.

Up until I met my current boyfriend, I had a lot of unsuccessful attempts at dating. A lot of misreading situations, coming on ""too strong"" by flirting overtly, or missing out on hints. It was a long, frustrating process to learn the rules, and I wasn't really experienced to begin with. So I was surprised how easy things came together when I started dating my BF.

My boyfriend is older, doesn't speak very much English, and has a lot of traditional Japanese values. But we both made an effort to come together from the moment we first met; the spark was there. He wants to get married in a year or so and expects that we'll start having kids right away. But he is also aware that I love teaching and doesn't want pressure me into giving up my job. He's been very considerate of my feelings and will listen and compromise whenever I have concerns. Our mantra is ""we're a team"" and the way we deal with problems really reflects that. I've met his parents and they were extremely accepting. This summer he'll travel with me to meet my folks for the first time, but they've already been totally supportive of us too. 

I guess my point is that: Yes, it's way more common to see Japanese women with Western men than the other way around.¬† Western women usually have trouble finding interested Japanese men. But when it happens, we really aren't that different from any other couple.

We all want to help one another, human beings are like that. We all want to live by each other's happiness, not by each other's misery. We don't want to hate and despise one another. In this world there is room for everyone and the good earth is rich and can provide for everyone.
The way of life can be free and beautiful. But we have lost the way.

Greed has poisoned men's souls, has barricaded the world with hate; has goose-stepped us into misery and bloodshed.

We have developed speed, but we have shut ourselves in;
machinery that gives abundance has left us in want.
Our knowledge has made us cynical,
our cleverness hard and unkind.
We think too much and feel too little.
More than machinery we need humanity,
more than cleverness we need kindness and gentleness.

Without these qualities life will be violent and all will be lost.

The aeroplane and the radio have brought us closer together. The very nature of these inventions cries out for the goodness in men, cries out for universal brotherhood for the unity of us all. Even now my voice is reaching millions throughout the world, millions of despairing men, women and little children, victims of a system that makes men torture and imprison innocent people. To those who can hear me I say: do not despair.

The misery that is now upon us is but the passing of greed, the bitterness of men who fear the way of human progress. The hate of men will pass and dictators will die, and the power they took from the people will return to the people and so long as men die liberty will never perish.

Soldiers: don't give yourselves to brutes, men who despise you and enslave you, who regiment your lives, tell you what to do, what to think and what to feel, who drill you, diet you, treat you as cattle, as cannon fodder!

Don't give yourselves to these unnatural men,
machine men, with machine minds and machine hearts.
You are not machines!
You are not cattle!
You are men!!
You have the love of humanity in your hearts.
You don't hate, only the unloved hate.
The unloved and the unnatural.
Soldiers: don't fight for slavery, fight for liberty!

In the seventeenth chapter of Saint Luke it is written:
- ""The kingdom of God is within man.""
Not one man, nor a group of men, but in all men: in you!

You the people have the power, the power to create machines, the power to create happiness. You the people have the power to make this life free and beautiful, to make this life a wonderful adventure.
Then, in the name of democracy, let us use that power, let us all unite!
Let us fight for a new world, a decent world that will give men a chance to work, that will give you the future and old age and security.
By the promise of these things, brutes have risen to power, but they lie. They do not fulfil their promise, they never will. Dictators free themselves but they enslave the people.
Now let us fight to fulfil that promise. Let us fight to free the world, to do away with national barriers, to do away with greed, with hate and intolerance. Let us fight for a world of reason, a world where science and progress will lead to all men's happiness.

"c9fgo2s","Mathematician here. I just wanted to say, the article does us all a profound disservice by saying that we accepted *i* just because ""it has interesting mathematical properties."" Arguably the single best reason for accepting *i* and the imaginary and complex numbers is because **in the same way that the real numbers represent a line, the complex numbers represent a plane.** In fact, Euler's identity was almost assuredly one of the results that inspired that realization in Gauss and other mathematicians.

Think of it this way: if you're talking about distance, you're basically putting the the real number line onto the world, with you at 0. If 1 is one meter in front of you, then -1 is one meter behind you, *i* is one meter to your left, and -*i* is one meter to your right. **Imaginary numbers are LITERALLY all around you! Gauss actually campaigned for mathematicians to refer to them as ""orthogonal numbers"" for exactly this reason; because they are orthogonal to the real numbers!** Unfortunately, he wasn't successful in this, but he did manage to get us to refer to the complex numbers as complex, instead of ""part-real"" or ""half-imagined"" or anything stupid like that.

"c97y5rj","But the design is defined by the medium and the way people wish to interact with it.

There is nothing that technically limits a car designer from inventing a steering wheel that's six feet in diameter, either, but the interaction does.

Maybe it would be better to say that *good* design is dictated by the medium. Just because you can do anything on a screen or the printed page doesn't mean that it will work. And what does work on the page and on the screen are very, very different. The page is dictated largley by the limitations of the eye and ink, and little else. The screen has inputs and is increasingly becoming an extension of human feedback, a projection of our senses and ideas. We output as well as input, and we use tools like fingers and voice and ears as well as eyes to do so. And despite any technical advancements, it all still exists to serve the same medium. It all must adapt to the limitations of the user.

Finally, and more specifically to the original point: the tools have their quirks and limitations, and our designs are subject to them. We can create virtually any vision in a bubble (or on Codepen), but out in the wild, filled with iPhones and Androids and Nokias and Internet Explorers, where humans with fat fingers and bluetooths and glitchy trackpads are our main consumers, our beautiful bird-of-paradise will quickly be gobbled up and expelled from the evolutionary ladder.

So while I agree that sites and RIAs can get pretty damn elaborate and designers are freer than they've ever been to explore the intricacies of the screen, there are still some constants at work here. Gravities and electromagnetisms that will break beautiful but impractical designs apart with the force of a thousand singularities.

Part of what we've learned since the early days of web design (when it really did feel like designers were just doing whatever the hell they wanted, damn the consequences) is to respect those constants. That's what the evolution toward the Big Four Principles of Modern Web Design (Slayer, Anthrax, Metallica, and Megadeth... err, I mean Semantic, Separate structure from presentation, Responsive, and now Mobile-First) has taught us. It's taught us that we can't reach the outer spheres just by attaching bigger rockets to our space ships.

It is the sorrow and the tragedy of Frodo that we must appreciate in order to understand the true implications of the narrative. If the ring were simply given to Sam, and he threw it without a bother to its unmaking, the essence of sacrifice, and the importance of the tale would be lost. Just because Middle-earth is ok, does not mean that all was unaffected. This isn't a story where every problem is solved - Saruman does not repent, as shown by his efforts to decimate the Shire, and many good heroes died who deserved to live. Frodo does not at the end succeed - he succumbs to the ring and the will that drives it - and it is only the actions by a figure more tragic than him that the ring is destroyed. Tragedy drives the narrative, and the tale of the third age was designed with this in mind. Ignibus puts it really well here in his comment:

To answer your question, I strongly believe that cannabis has partially contributed to an acceleration of my growth as a human being. Intellectually, emotionally, and in other regards. It expanded my perspective in a drastic manner and forced me to think about things that I chose to either ignore or take for granted throughout most of my life. I think about people much differently than I used to, often considering every minute aspect of a conversation, analyzing and debating internally what brought a person to say what they said or express what they expressed. This is the pattern of thinking that marijuana inspires for me, personally. I can apply that pattern to other aspects of life and human experience and come to very satisfying conclusions about certain situations, sometimes even finding direction within them.

On the other hand, I would say the biggest drawback from my experience is associated with memory. Not even from an academic or scholastic stance, which is an area that I've always done pretty well in, but moreso from a stance of experience. I can't tell you how many videos I've watched with my friends during our times using marijuana together, mainly because I can barely remember even watching the videos.

"c8ra0b8","I am from SW Missouri, relocated from the Kansas City area. Both areas, especially SW MO have serious meth problems.  It is not uncommon to see meth-heads about town here in town.  There is a huge awareness campaign against meth these days but the hills foster prime locations for meth labs, i.e. Winter's Bone.  Law enforcement officers have been finding it fairly difficult to locate and stop meth labs in the Ozark Mountains, which are notoriously beautiful, but very remote and hard to travel through.  When I lived in the KC area, the suburb of Independence had what I thought was the highest incident rate for meth related crimes and meth labs in the nation, at least that's what I have seen in the past (correct me if I am wrong).  It is a shame that the SW has such a bad issue with this drug, since the area is honestly quite beautiful and filled with kind people.  Like I said before, it is very common to see meth heads out and about town, especially at the store I work.

"c8r93ag","&gt;Scientific discoveries don't usually replace religious tenets,

The earth was created in 6 days? God created the animals as-is? There was no world-wide flood? These are maybe not tenets, but at least teachings of the Bible, which were taken literally until proper application of empirical evidence steered us firmly the other way.

&gt;Logical arguments ARE evidence.

I would disagree with that, since without some kind of empirical evidence, most logical claims can be completely dissociated from reality. One can make very sound logical arguments (internal consistency) that have nothing to do with reality (not valid) and the only way to know is through evidence. Logical arguments are a ways to structure ideas into a concise argument, it is not evidence.

&gt;Sometimes, He does it miraculously, but more often than not I believe He works through natural means. 

This here is the problem. I can say that aspirins don't actually do anything, it's just that God heals your headache when you take an aspirin pill. One can say this about anything in the real world, and there is no way to tell if something works because it works, or if it doesn't work, but God makes it seem like it works anyways.

&gt;If someone gets better, I thank God bot for modern medecine and that He saw fit to extend that persons life.

The good thing with modern medicine is that it works no matter what one believes. It does not depend on God nor on faith. I must ask also, if a person is not healed, then do you blame God for his death? If you can credit God, surely you can criticize him as well, no?

&gt;So, you wouldn't try to prove that God does not exist?

I can't prove it, but I can show compelling arguments that show it is more likely that he doesn't exist than that he does. It's impossible to prove 100%, but it's still possible to be say 90% convinced he isn't there.

&gt;A lot of what I believe now is due to my own reading, my own thoughts and life experiences.

Fair enough, however how much of what you believe in souls comes from a non-christian source? If there is no empirical evidence, and the claims are metaphysical, then what's to show your metaphysical evidence for souls is any better than someone else's metaphysical evidence for chakras, chi, or auras?

&gt;Look at our world and how well-designed as it is.

Natural catastrophes, extreme climate changes, earthquakes, volcanoes, meteor impacts and tsunamis all indicate a rather poorly-designed world to me, no?

I agree that the world is balanced and beautiful, but in a chaotic undirected kind of way. What we see is not the result of design with an end-product in mind, it is the result of random processes, chaos, chance, and selection of what works and discarding what doesn't. Every process that wasn't self-sustaining or capable of building up rather than destroying, self-destructed. We are now left over with the only systems that actually worked.

&gt;Neither have any evolutionary benefit, so why do they exist?

Actually, music is part of a social setting, and it helps groups bond as well as being a means of communication. Animals sing and make noise all the time. They have their own music, and we came from the same place as them. Just because our music is different, and we've refined it, doesn't mean we are the only musicians. Art is a reflection of what is beautiful to us, and a sense of beauty helps us select healthy-looking fruit and healthy-looking mates to ensure our survival. Think about this: some of the first artwork we had was of food (bison paintings) and of fertility goddesses (Venus of Willendorf).

&gt;If the universe burst into form with no help, then why not just remain an ever expanding blob of shapelessness? Why develop to the point that there are sentient creatures to observe it?

The universe was an ever-expanding blob of shapeless protons and neutrons, and as the universe expanded, it cooled. It cooled enough to allow protons and neutrons and electrons to condense into atoms of hydrogen. The hydrogen cloud spread out, but gravity made it so that hydrogen atoms clumped together into great clouds. The pressure of the clouds was eventually strong enough that somewhere in the center of the cloud, two hydrogen atoms were smashed together, and the first star was born. The star burned the hydrogen and made all the other elements with nuclear fusion, then exploded and sent all these elements out throughout space. Eventually, these clumps of hard matter condensed and made asteroids, made meteorites, made proto-planets, and things clumped and clumped and clumped together until you had planets.

Per sentient life, there was no need of any sentient life at all. After the planet cooled, chemical elements began to form together into stable molecules like sugars and proteins and simple RNA. Eventually, life arose from the primordial soup about 3.4 billions years ago. From then on life changed and evolved and mutated and adapted to every environment it could. Homo sapiens have been around for only about 200 000 years ago. When you compare 200 000 years (and remember, these were just hunter-gatherers back then, very primitive) and 3 400 000 000 years, we have been on earth for practically nothing at all. If you were to say that 3 400 000 000 years is the length of a football field, with the beginning of life on one end and today on the other, the time humans have spent on the planet is proportionally smaller than the width of a single blade of grass, on that whole football field. There is a very real chance that sentient life might never have developed on earth at all.

&gt;There are a million things one could list that have no real use, but we enjoy them.

You'd be surprised at what their uses actually were. 

&gt;There is no evolutionary imperative to enjoy a sunset or create a symphony.

To enjoy the sunset resonates with our sense of beauty, which started out to seek out healthy mates. To create a symphony comes from the imperative to make noise, for people to come together. There is no imperative to enjoy those things, but our instincts and senses which were honed for survival are not being adapted to serve new functions, such as enjoy music.

&gt;I could go through historical evidence to show that the Bible is reliable as a historical document.

Not particularly. It makes errors in regards to the historicity of say Herod's death, makes claims about earthquakes and the sky turning dark for an hour at Jesus' death (which everyone at the time would have noticed but nobody bothered to comment on it apparently) and is not reliable when it comes to say the exodus from Egypt, as there is no record of the 10 plagues either.

&gt;Lewis' trilemma (liar, lunatic, Lord)

That's sort of a false dilemma, but with 3 choices instead of 2. It could also be that Jesus never claimed to the the Son of God, and that words were put in his mouth post-mortem as the bible was written and edited. The fact the gospel of John was written between 10 and 70 years of Jesus' death as well as containing possible signs of redaction seem to confirm this. The Lord, liar, lunatic trilemma forgets one option, which is that other people lied about Jesus.

&gt;A belief in sin is a belief that atheists and Christians simply don't share. Weirdly, it's actually right up there with belief in God.

It is my firm conviction that sin is an imaginary disease you convince people they are afflicted of, so you can then sell them your miracle cure. Disease: sin Solution: Jesus. Disease: Thetans Solution: clearing session. Disease: eternal reincarnation and pain Solution: Nirvanah. This kind of thinking is common in practically all religions. It comes as no surprise to me then that belief and God and in sin are closely tied, since you must believe in sin to believe that you need God and salvation.

"c8r8o20","I spent part of my summer at Polytech and I LOVED it. Are you staying at IMOP? If so A) don't lose the towel they give you (the cleaning ladies will flip shit) and B) if you're gonna be out past curfew, try to know when Sergei is on guard duty at the front desk because he is a total bro (assuming he still works that desk, the guards are subcontracted). Most of the other guards are either totally apathetic or complete power-tripping jerks. Sergei will share a cigarette and a story with you every time you come back late. I think I even still have his phone number written somewhere. If not staying at IMOP, disregard.

The area around Polytech is pretty nice overall, but... quaint. It's a sleeping district, so there's obviously not much nightlife or anything. Since I stayed at IMOP I usually used the Akademicheskaya metro station (the metro is awesome btw), and there's a pretty nice shopping center across the street (way cheaper than shopping in center city). There weren't many good bars in the immediate area, or at least that I knew of, but there are a few restaurants that aren't awful if you need a place to sit down with friends (mostly chains/franchises like ""Beer House"" and some pizza place I can't remember). I can't say anything about the punk/metal scene in SPb, most of my time was spent in bars/clubs on and around Nevsky, but I'm sure you won't have a problem finding it. Just a note, the Polytech metro station isn't in a particularly bad neighborhood, but the area between IMOP and the main part of campus/Polytech station is more of an industrial zone. Best to avoid at night. The area between IMOP and Akademicheskaya metro is populated and fairly well lit 24/7 (especially during the White Nights). The metro generally closes between midnight and 00:30, depending on the station and line. In the spring and summer, all the bridges except one across the Neva river open to allow boat traffic through, effectively cutting the city in half. It's beautiful, but sometimes inconvenient (Polytech is on the north side of the river, downtown is on the south side). Gypsy cabs are regardless generally cheap, and the largest bridge stays open.

I can't say anything in comparison to other universities, but I met a lot of international students while I was there. For the most part my floor was filled with Germans, Italians, French, and the occasional Finn (some other Americans showed up when our group was leaving). The dorm next to IMOP houses most of the non-Russian CIS students (mainly Belorussians and Ukrainians) and some Russian students not originally from SPb. There are also a lot of Chinese and African students, but as far as living arrangements go they're usually kept separate from the European students (you'll find Russia is really candid about race relations...).

Your appearance shouldn't be a problem, at least I wouldn't think so. In the university atmosphere you shouldn't have a problem meeting people and making friends, and out on the town I doubt anyone would mess with you if you have the badass viking metal look going on. Make Russian friends so you can practice your Russian without pressure. There's a 99% chance most of them will want to practice their English with you.

I'm sure there are other people who spent more time there and can give better or more specific advice. But, like I said, I loved it when I was there, and if you have more questions feel free to ask. I'm in the process of setting myself up to spend time post-undergrad/pre-grad school in SPb to continue studying Russian and to work as an English teacher, and I'm trying to arrange my visa through IMOP since I already have contacts there. If all goes according to plan, I might see you around!

Additionally, I'm assuming you're an American. If that is the case: 8-812-331-26-00. It's the US Consulate General's phone number. When I saw their big imposing black Chevy Tahoes barreling down Nevsky with Old Glory flapping in the breeze, it brought a tear to my 'MURICAN eyes. If you're not American, keep your country's consulate phone number on your person or in your phone, anyway. Just in case; you shouldn't have any problems (again, especially if you're a viking badass). I can't remember the emergency numbers now, but I kept them in my phone too. Also, don't put much confidence in the police on the off chance that you do need their assistance, but that should be a given.

tl;dr - Polytech is awesome, SPb is awesome, you're going to have a great time

"c8r3wpi","Gorgeous places in London to propose would be Covent Garden, Hyde Park, St James' Park (gorgeous bridge with a view of the London eye over the trees, I can give you more details if you want), the Tower of London gardens, the Westminster bridge by Big Ben is really just a regular bridge with cars and a great view - not too romantic but the gardens around Westminster Abbey are great. Natural History Museum is one of the most beautiful buildings in London. Leicester square and Piccadilly circus are nice, but very people populated (no romantic privacy) and a bit... commercial.

"c8nzjsl","Expat here, living in the US now for 7 years, but originally from Pretoria. South Africa is beautiful but cruel. There are awesome nature spots, wildlife, the weather is fantastic (especially if you go down to the Cape town area) and the people are for the most part friendly and fun to be around with.  

What you'll find strange though, is the mixture between first world and third world. Although South Africa has by far the strongest economy of all the African countries, it still is pretty much a developing country with many, many people living in poverty. The weird thing is that you can pretty much avoid it if you choose - if you stay mostly in the extremely upmarket Sandton or Houghton areas in Johannesburg or the eastern suburbs of Pretoria, you almost won't realize you're not in a first world country.  

The ANC's policy of Black Economic Empowerment (BEE) has established a much stronger black middle class than ever before, and especially among the younger generation (people in their 20's to early 30's) you'll find much less racial segregation than before. The segregation that still prevails is mostly economic, but this is typical of any country - think about the ""1%"" in America, for example.  

Is it safe? You will get mixed responses, and honestly it depends on where you live. Where I used to live (Pretoria East), there was violent crime, even in the wealthy suburbs such as Waterkloof or Faerie Glen. I personally know several people who have been victims of car hijackings, a couple of murders, and one female friend was raped during an armed robbery by 2 robbers. (Yes, they both raped her.)  

The funny thing is that I always used to think this is ""normal"" - I mean people get shot in movie theaters in America, right? It was not until I lived somewhere else for a while that I realized how paranoid and ""edgy"" many South Africans have become.  

I cannot tell you with a clean conscience that it is ""safe"", but I can tell you it's probably not as bad as you think, but it's not a care-free utopia either. The truth is probably somewhere in the middle. No it is not a war zone like some expats make it out to be, but once you see the houses with the 8-foot walls and electric fences and burglar bars everywhere, you might get a different picture.

"c8kkd77","Some in this thread have mentioned a calm acceptance of death. Such an acceptance might have saved this guy, just like the calm he got from looking into his buddy's eyes. A friend of mine was once cliff diving and at one point, while completely under water, he lost all sense of direction. (Let's ignore the wisdom of cliff diving in dangerous conditions.) At first he was terrified but, as soon as he accepted that he was going to die, he felt totally at peace. Just then a very simple thought occurred to him: exhale. He realized that what he thought was down was actually up, and swam to the surface. Panic makes it harder to think and as such fear of death can be exactly what kills you.

The comment linked in the OP is a great example of why many atheists' denial of spirituality can fill their lives with fear. Death becomes a definite end, a literal oblivion of absolute nothingness. Don't misunderstand me, organized religion has caused great harm in the world, but seeing that harm and going to the opposite extreme, of denying any form of spirituality, can be very harmful to an individual.

I don't think debating the validity of various spiritual beliefs is very productive, as long as they're not grounded in dogma, but I do believe that there are plenty of good reasons to believe that there is something out there. Most of my friends have incredible disdain for organized religion but believe very deeply that we are not alone, that there is something profoundly beautiful about existence which transcends our human lives. Call it Gaia, God, The Force, whatever, it exists.

Before I talk about why I believe it exists, consider the effects of faith and and disbelief. (I have done both and, though my experience is not universal, others have likely had similar experiences.)

Typically disbelief in something divine is characterized by an insistence on evidence and rationality to hold anything to be true. In most cases this is a good thing but in many it is not. I define faith to mean holding some belief to be true without conclusive evidence. Blind faith would then be belief accepted without your own personal consideration, this is dogma and is very dangerous. So now let's consider a case where faith, belief in the truth of something without conclusive evidence, can be very beneficial and actually detrimental to deny: love.

You love your significant other, you trust them with the care of your children, that they'll be there to help you, that they will act in certain ways, that they love you too. Life has shown time and time again that, no matter how well we think we know someone, they can always surprise us. Their actions in the past in no way guarantee certain actions in the future, yet we trust them to behave a certain way. This is trust without conclusive evidence, faith.

""I don't trust them completely, I simply see this person as the safe bet, they will be more reliable than anyone else."" Why? As much as we think we may know somebody, there are countless cases where people act in a way in total opposition to how they've acted before.

""They make me happy, I love them for that."" They can, at any moment and without warning, hurt you more deeply than any physical wound. If you are involved with them, you trust them not to (or at least believe them less likely to hurt you than others), otherwise you wouldn't be involved.

Love demands an act of faith, actions based upon a belief lacking conclusive evidence. I suppose people can be content with the position that love is justified because this person is the best person they've met. In a world devoid of inherent meaning, you might as well find happiness and define meaning within that context. That doesn't make any sense to me because the context, life within a meaningless universe, won't last. Everything we value in life must be considered with life's end in mind.

""Ok, so what about god?""

I hate that word so we're not going to use it. Instead: spirituality. Deeply believing that there is something to existence which goes far beyond our physical lives declaws death, just as trusting your lover not to hurt you strengthens your relationship. I greatly prefer to live as long as I can since death appears to be a one way trip, but when it comes and there's nothing I can do to stop it, I hope to great it eagerly awaiting finding out what comes next. Spiritual belief can be very helpful in this regard.

I believe existence has a purpose, that there is some inherent meaning to our lives. My personal reasons for this believe aren't based solely on empirical evidence but there is good evidence that life has a purpose.

Consider what we are, what we know about ourselves. We are the inevitable outcome of an unimaginably complex chaotic system. Ever changing patterns of energy condensed into physical form, constantly flowing in and out of the energy around us. (Matter and energy construed as interchangeable. This is debatable so feel free to substitute energy with matter *and* energy.) The matter in your body wasn't there a year ago, the food you eat today will be you and then be not you. So what are you? I see you as a flow of energy, a river constantly in flux.

Rivers are inseparable from the waters around them. Yes they have a definable structure which makes them different from others, but they would not exist without the others. The river You is fed by the rivers Bread and Water, and may someday join another river to create the river Child. We flow in and out of those around us just as the water we drink, the air we breathe, and the food we eat flows in and out of our bodies.

But some rivers of energy are special, different from the rivers around them. The other rivers flow downhill in whatever path they end up in. Mountain flows into Rock which flows into Sand, a natural path with a beautiful but thoughtless direction. But Humans, we can choose to flow uphill. We can choose to divert the river Rock and turn it into the river Bread. We can know the rivers, we can see that they are rivers, and we can change how they flow.

Our rivers can say ""Holy shit, I'm a river! What is a river anyway? What makes me different from the water around me? Why should I care? Do I even want to be a river?"" They can play with the rivers around them, they can 'love' other rivers, whatever love means anyway, and they can create rivers that they've never seen before. They can say ""I want to be a different kind of river. I want my river to flow farther, and longer, and I want it to do a loop somewhere, maybe with a waterfall just for shits and giggles. And I want to know how I can want anything.""

Some of these rivers think that when they can't think anymore that they'll stop being rivers. They don't know that it's not up to them. When they stop being able to say ""I'm a river"" they'll still be rivers. They'll still flow in and out of the rivers around them. They'll feed new streams and the path's they've carved will forever change the rivers around them in way's they'll never know. They'll still be a part of the water that flows through everything.

""But why should it matter if they know that they are rivers?""

Because then they can stop being afraid. They can stop being afraid of other rivers, of where they'll flow next, and of what the other rivers think of them. They'll know it won't matter because every time they fear another river, they're just afraid of a part of themselves. Everything they hate about others is something they hate about themselves and every time they hurt another, they're just hurting themselves.

But every time they help another they'll help themselves. Every time they want another to be happy, they'll become happier. Every time they share, every time they care, every time they love, it all comes back. Everything we do for each other is just another way of doing something for ourselves.

They'll know that knowing they are a river is special because they'll always be a river, but they only get to know it for a little while. They'll know that when they love any river, even themselves, they are loving the water that flows in every river. They'll know that they are part of everyone they've ever loved, everyone they've never met, and everyone that has or will be.

When we know that we're all part of the same stream we can start being the best rivers that we can be. We can have more fun, share more love, learn more about being a river, and flow to the farthest corners of the universe.


When it comes down to it though, I have no idea if any of what I said is true. I'm just a human and there's no good reason for me to be any more right than anyone else. But I choose to believe, I choose to have faith, I choose this way of thinking. Why? Because acting on this belief, this faith, even if it's the biggest crock of shit ever spewed from the mouth of a hairless yahoo, means that I will be kinder, more generous, and more caring toward those around me. I will love more, play harder, and learn as much as I can because all the love, fun, and knowledge I share with you all will just make my life better. And I will fight for your happiness because I know that your happiness fuels mine. I choose this belief because being good to those around me becomes the most selfish thing I could ever do, and I'm a pretty selfish guy.

I went pretty off topic but I enjoyed writing all that, if you've read this far then I hope you enjoyed it too.

 To get an idea of what you'd be getting, look at this shigefusa (no stock) http://yhst-27988581933240.stores.yahoo.net/shigefusa-wa-gyuto-240mm-kitaeji-blade-kn240.html

Price should be about the same, probably a bit more in Japan.  Beautiful...


If you go to other stores you'll see a lot of Aritsugu and Masamoto knives.  You'll see them everywhere. Not that its something wrong with it, but I don't think it fits into the ""impossible to find in America"" requirement.

Another knife I find really beautiful, but overpriced for its actual steel, is Nenox / Nehoni.  Its available in America too, you can find them at Korin in NYC or online.  But the handle is really unique looking and its a great looking knife.  From what I""ve read the performance isn't worth the price, but hey, it's still pretty awesome I'm sure.  Look up nenox / nehoni to get a look at their knives.  very unique.  Nehoni has a store in Tsukiji, which your relative would probably want to visit as its a great place for tourists to see.

**1)** No, it isn't too big.  It's a distinguishing feature of your unique and beautiful self that people who love you will love as well.  If anyone thinks negatively of you as a person because of this, that's okay!  You've avoided interacting with a superficial jerk.  In the meantime, the overwhelming majority of people who don't care/like it will be happy in your company.

**2)** That is called brown, which is the most common eye color. Eyes are shiny and pretty and yours are no exception, no matter what shade of brown they may be. 

**3)** Too big for what?  Anyone who judges your worth as a person based on how your teeth look needs to rethink things.

**4)** Too long for what? In which dimension? Are you a pac-man or something whose face must be a perfect circle?

**5)** Well, yeah, so's mine, that's why I never smile and glower instead.

*Just kidding*, smiling is a basic human expression and people who see you smile will be happier, no matter how unusual yours is.  People like seeing other people happy. Additionally, given the rest of your complaints, I'm almost certain your smile looks perfectly normal and you're just being silly about it.

**6)** Are you a pianist? Long enough for what? If you can type this using a keyboard, your fingers are almost certainly of sufficient length for pretty much anything.

**7)** So's everyone.  If you really care that much you can shorten it to any length you desire using a shaver or some other similar tool of empowerment.

**8)** /r/tinytits has as many readers as /r/bustypetite, so I'm not sure I follow you...

**9)** If we can reach them while cuddling, they're perfect.

**10)** If we can reach them while cuddling, they're perfect.

**11)** All the more reason for us to...er...anyway, not a problem.

**12)** Maybe if you stand perfectly still, all day, someone will notice and then immediately stop caring, because this bothers no one except for you, seriously.  If anything, people would think it's cool, you're like an animorph or some other badass mutant thing

**13)** Stomachs are supposed to be loose so that they can expand to hold food, unless I'm missing something crucial here...

**14)** Gross?  Thighs are always cool, you can do squats or something if it really bothers you.  I'd like to take this time to remind you that anyone who judges your value as a person based on how the fine details of your appearance match up to some imaginary standard needs to rethink things, **you included**.

**15)** If we can hug you, that's small enough.

**16)** Big hips are...like...an identifying feature of your gender, woman  

**17)** Lots of things in the body are not straight.  You're just making up issues at this point to justify a negative self-image.  Flip that around and think about all of the ways that you're gorgeous‚ÄìI guarantee you there are far more than twenty; more than a hundred, probably, especially at the level of obsessive detailing you've been going into.

**18)** Like your other mention of brown here, this is incredibly common [you described my hair as well, yay!].  How could this possibly be a bad thing?  That's *who you are*, and there's no reason not to be damn proud of it.

**19)** From fighting off hordes of lustful admirers?

**20)** How did you even find these lol

&gt; I'll stop there.

Do go on, beautiful, but from now on I'm ruling out anything that contains the word ""too"", ""weird"", or ""enough"" under the grounds of me having already explained why comparing yourself to some imaginary standard of beauty is a self-harming and unrealistic way to go through life, especially given that no one else who cares about you will ever do the same, because they love you for the person you are rather than hating you for not being the unattainable fantasy they've been deluded to worship

As a woman who has breasts and loves playing with other breasts I remember being enthralled by how different everyone's body is the first time I got to play with a pair besides my own.  All of them are so different and I love the variety.  I personally have smaller (34B) breasts and for whatever reason mine have more glandular tissue then fat so they tend to feel firmer.  The first time I played with another woman's boobs hers were so different then mine.  They were so soft and smooth and they had so much bounce and sway and part of that was because of the sag to them.  I was captivated by that experience and how profoundly beautiful it was and to this day I love saggy boobs.

My partner [M] loves boobs of all types and he was really the first person I've known to say openly how much he loves saggy boobs.  That boy loves all boobs in all the varieties and has said to me many times, ""I could never hate a boob"".  For anyone who likes boobs that are big, a natural sag is par for the course that comes with the added weight of having bigger boobs and its just another trait that makes them so beautiful.

Don't hate your body.  Half the things that you consider ""imperfections"" are something that someone else will think are quite beautiful.

* The director (writer, whatever) has a very clear point.

* The point is being repeated, in many different forms.

* The point is underlined, both in small events and in the main plot.

* The point is pretty obvious, but every character in the movie acts like it's a personal revelation when they finally figure it out

* Those that don't figure it out die horrible deaths - if they figure it out on their deathbeds, we get the sad music, if they don't figure it out before they die, it means they're evil, and we get a victory montage.

* The point is repeated, again.

I can think of two books that came across as pretentious to me, though. 

[The tortilla curtain](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tortilla_Curtain), where the point is that *of course* illegal immigrants go where they can find work and food, even if they have no long term safety net. A comparison is made to coyotes who'll enter a gated community to snatch a small dog or cat, even if it's dangerous and close to humans, because hey: Free Food!.

The other book was [The hunchback of Notre Dame](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hunchback_of_Notre-Dame), where the choice between that which is beautiful but flawed, or that which is ugly but consistent, useful and good, is hammered home, repeatedly. Of course there's Quasimodo and Phoebus. Phoebus is engaged, but decides to have sex with Esmeralda anyway (nice face, bad character) and Quasimodo is single and ugly, but saves Esmeralda, and is willing to sacrifice himself for her. The point is hammered home when Esmaralda is given some flowers and two flower pots - one is beatiful, made of glass, but has a crack so it leaches water, the other is simple earthenware jug, but is solid. Esmeralda chooses the beautiful one, and the flowers die. Esmeralda also chooses the flawed, beautiful guy, and she dies.

I'd like to note that even though ""Pretentious"" is often seen as synonymous with ""artsy-fartsy"", I think those two are very different.

I was at my usual bar on a weekend night with my way-too-sexy female wingmate (no, we never got it on; she's not the story). Then Roxy shows up. She was just amazing. Beautiful but seemingly ignorant of it. Charming and witty. I came back to my table to find her in my chair, I pointed that out and said I could get us both something to sit on.

At a table of a dozen or so very chatty people, we spent the entire evening all but ignoring everybody else. Just utterly enthralled with one another and our conversation.

Midway the next work-week and I'm flicking through my phone, clearing out old numbers.

I'll tell this one last story as it is connected, although I have far too many more.  A girl in one of my classes who is short and cute I kind of start to have a crush on.  We study a bit together and grieve over the amount of work required of us.  We start doing study dates and library trips and then....a relative of hers has been diagnosed with a disease which I cannot remember the name of...although it leads to your body gradually falling apart.  It's very serious, obviously.  I comfort her as best I can, while respecting her boundaries.  I feel it would be extremely disrespectful to make a move when she's emotionally torn, I'd just feel like a scumbag.  A few days later, I am in one of the local school coffee shops drinking tea and studying with the female in the previous story, when the female from this story walks in and spots me, says hello with wide eyes, spots that I'm sitting with another girl, and gives her demon eyes.  Really nasty.  I quickly offer an introduction, being sure to say ""this is my friend XYZ, we're chilling and studying here.""  This seems to ease some tension, she is still nice to me, but remains using dagger eyes at my female friend.  Naturally you can see where this is an issue.  Here you have a female who practically lives in your room who is friend-zoned, and a female who lives a mere flight of stairs above you who every time she sees you also sees this other female friend.  Naturally she makes the assumption that I had lied to her, and that I'm probably dating the girl who lives in my room.  That bridge is burnt.

TL;DR: I have the opposite issue, women I am not attracted to approach and cling to me, I can't break things off due to a misplaced sense of gentlemanly behavior, women I AM attracted to are off-put due to the sense that I am already ""claimed.""

Fuck it, I have one more.  This one eats me alive to this day.

I have been in HS for a year now and after track season, I end up having an injured leg.  It requires physical therapy etc.  Weeks into it after I am able to walk and jog a bit, I go to a summer camp type thing that is a mixture of physical activity and mental stimulation (fascinating topics), the place is filled with interesting individuals whose minds are positively sparkly with ideas, really great environment, the group is about 20 strong and contains individuals of a wide range of 11-20 year olds from all different parts of the world.  That very day, I decide that I'm not going to be an introvert, I'm going to be as open as I can be, and get to know these people.  Now, the main reason I was so eager to do this is because of a girl.  She is three years younger than me, maybe three and a half, and although I have the strong sense that she is too young for me now, I can't help wanting to get to know her.  She is the absolute essence of cute.  Absolutely ravishing, and while young, I knew she'd be quite something growing up.  I soon learned that she was not only beautiful, but incredibly competitive, intelligent, and driven.  I can't tell you how attractive these qualities are to me.  I succeed in getting to know her, and find out that she of all the individuals there doesn't actually live that far from me...let's just say less than an hour away...which for a global camp with 20 people is quite the coincidence.  The camp ends and I promise myself not to lose contact with her, even recommending she look at my HS.  Years pass, and my obsession with her, although somewhat ebbed by time, is nevertheless a dormant giant.  I hear somehow through the grape vine, that she is going to be attending my HS and has moved to within 20 minutes of where I live.  I feel like there's just no way I could be so lucky.  I get back in contact with her and tell her how if there's anything she needs she should ask me for help, with anything at all, really, anything.  Now, I remind you, at this point I am starting my senior year and she is entering as a freshman.  She's still very questionably too young for me.  The first day arrives and when I first run into her, I expect something of a casual ""Hey!  Long time no see, how are you?""  Instead, the moment she sees me, it is in a crowded student section of book lockers.  Her eyes light up, she drops what she's doing (chatting with her friend) and runs at me and jumps into my arms with a hug that is the nicest hug I've ever received in my life.  She looks stunning.  A vision of innocent beauty, literally wearing a flower in her hair and a beautiful dress.  I am flabbergasted to say the least.  I catch up a bit and say how great it is to see her and all, reminding her that if she needs help with anything, I'm her guy.  I explain the ins and outs of the school, things she should know, teachers she should avoid, etc.  Well, time passes and I tell a close friend of mine that I have had a tremendous crush on this girl for years now, despite myself holding back due to the age concern.  I know that if I ever saw a senior guy hitting on a freshman girl I'd probably kick his ass if he even remotely was intrusive on her space.  As such, I didn't want to be seen as a crib robber.  My friend, however, thinks I'm being over dramatic, and that I should just make a move.  He says he's got a perfect idea, he's throwing a party for a whole bunch of students and he says I should invite her to come, get to meet the upperclassmen.  He insists to the extent that I IM her while he's with me, and because I'm freaking out about it, he takes the wheel for me, and asks her questions I would never have asked like ""what kind of drinks do you like?""  I'm not a party kind of guy, nor a drinking kind of guy, nor a womanizer, and so this strikes me as such a bad idea.  If she likes me for who I am, then this clearly is going to send the wrong message of who I am and what I'm looking for.  I literally get a fever as it's happening and I ask him to leave before he invites her on my behalf.  The conversation ends harmlessly because she has to go, although I have fears that she has already started to peg me as a ""get her drunk"" sort of guy.  I loathe myself for having allowed it to get to this point.  A short time passes during which I slightly cut myself off from contact, not pursuing.  I should mention here that I was 100% right about my first impression, she became a STUNNING beauty and was immediately one of those girls on facebook who has thousands of friends and guys constantly CONSTANTLY hitting on her via wall and pictures.  I find this so scummy.  After a short amount of time, I start hearing rumors about her, namely, that she's a slut.  I can't believe it, I won't.  She's the innocent flower of beauty in my life that hasn't bloomed enough to be picked.  But sadly, the rumors begin falling in from all angles, and it becomes apparent that any guy that wants to can get with her, and while some guys would have clapped their hands at this news, not I.  I am devastated.  I have no desire to be one of the hundreds of guys who get used and discarded.  I am sickened that a person so incredible could have done something like this.  It's clear that something went wrong during the years I had not seen her.  I would later go on to find out it was her parents' divorce which hit her extremely hard.  How I found this out was heart-wrenching, I'm sure for the both of us.  One night, as I sat at my computer, she IM'ed me, asking if I could talk.  I obviously said absolutely, and she began to pour her heart out about how terribly she felt about something that had just happened.  She had given a blowjob to a student who then proceeded to brag about it with all his buddies, and obviously leading back to her, but also being a horrible situation because her best female friend was sexually assaulted in a park indirectly due to her.  Really a terrible situation all around.  She continued to tell how she regretted having been so loose with her judgement, and thanked me for being a sort of moral compass for her.  I was stunned.  I comforted her as best I could over IM's, but she was clearly in a dark place.  She left school shortly after and I'm betting she ended up getting professional help and then transferring schools.  She deleted her facebook and I lost contact with her, always, always wondering what had happened to my dream girl.  Yesterday, on my birthday, (which I did not really celebrate due to impending finals) she (along with ANOTHER girl I crushed on, but later in college) was one of the few people who wished me a happy birthday on facebook.  I think this is as good a time as any to end, with the promise that I refuse to let this story end here.  

This post almost definitely doesn't belong in here, but I had to tell it, get the weight off my chest, so to any who see it, I hope you enjoyed my story and perhaps my story telling.

"c7g3l91","IDK if you consider it a plot hole, or bad continuity, or just lazy writing, but when Prometheus came out everybody kept saying that the Scientists were idiots and always did exactly the wrong thing at the wrong time despite supposedly being the *best and brightest*.

I think there is a just a lot of subplot about the tension between Vickers and Weyland that is glossed over/not fully explored. 

She is the heir apparent to Weyland-Yutani (the corporation) and the mission is to give her father immortality. 

*She's* the one that picked the scientists. *She's* the one who tells everybody how they are the best and brightest.

She *also* made plans for an extended stay by herself on the planet (the lifeboat).

If the mission is a success, then she might never get to claim her birthright as head of Weyland-Yutani because her father (who was frozen on his deathbed apparently) will never die.

THE SCIENTISTS ARE SUPPOSED TO BE IDIOTS! Their actions are SUPPOSED to be so egregious as to demonstrate this to the viewers. Vickers chose bad scientists because she has motive for the mission to fail, and she planned for herself to be the last survivor of the mission and to be able to survive long enough for a rescue mission.

Also interesting to note that David (the loyal company android) in the movie refers to Vickers as mum, and in Alien the corporations mainframe is called Mother. Possibly inferring that although Weyland and Vickers both presumably died, somehow ONE of them had achieved their desired flavor of immortality and continuing control of the Weyland empire...

- For how much Girl B is more exciting in bed, she is less attractive

But, this question seems to imply that even after trading in looks, Girl B is still attractive... but what if they both start off average.

GW2 - Had such expectations for this. I wouldn't say I regret it yet, as I still see myself logging in as it doesn't require monthly sub.

D3 - Holy shit what a crapfest. 

Torchlight 2 - Had no idea why I bought it after being dissapointed in D3. Well it didnt bring anytinng new to the table, nor did it make the experience unique..

Borderlands 2 - Played maybe 5 hours but I didn't have any fun, shitty missions and no real intro for the uninitiated in the series. Guns made no sense, and there was no real way of getting into it. (for me)

Far Cry 3 - Playing it atm, so far it's nothing really unique... It feels like yet another console-port to pc, even tho it might not be. I don't follow production. Beautiful but boring.

"c776sx9","In high school me and the girl friend would go 'parking' in the unfinished, under construction suburban areas near where we lived.  It was hilly and they left a lot of trees so you would always find a nice scenic, secluded spot with no street lights.  

One winter weekend night we went for a park after a fresh snow.  Found a nice cul-de-sac street.  We were the first tracks threw the snow in the whole neighborhood so I knew it would be a nice private setting.  Since it was winter we always had  blankets in the back.  Beers (yea Fake ID!), snacks, blankets, condoms...we were all set. 

It turned into a wild session.  One of our best.  It started snowing lightly which gave a great romantic vibe to our teen-age lust fest. We were at it for hours in the back seat.  We were there so long the windows didn't just fog up they froze over.  She was literally screaming in ecstasy, legs up over my shoulders and I was rocking away in pure heaven.  

At some point she says 'Oh God I'm seeing lights'...to which my ego, and cock, grew like the Grinch's heart...three sizes as least.  We kept at it...both of us moaning loudly now.  The car is literally bouncing with our passion.

About five minutes later she says ""Oh my God...I do see lights!"".  Shit.  Cop.  ""Oh my God.  We are in so much fucking trouble"" she said.  I had to chuckled at that one as she covered herself completely with the blanket.  ""Yea, 'fucking trouble'"".

The trooper's spot light was shinning brightly in the car back window and I heard is door open and shut.  I just had time to get my underwear on by the time he stepped to the back door and tapped on the window.  In nothing but my tighty whities I rolled down the back door window and could only mutter ""yea?"".


""I'll need to see your drivers license"" says the trooper.
""Just a second.  I need to find my pants"" I said panicked a bit.
""I'll need to see both your drivers licenses"" he returns.
""I don't have it"" she says in a very stressed whisper.
""That's going to be a problem"" the trooper chimed in ominously.
""Can you give us a few minutes?"" I pleaded.
""Sure"" he says and starts looking around the car.


I quickly find my pants, my wallet and finally my license.  Just as he's pointing his flashlight in the direction of our empty beer cans (thankfully covered by the fresh snow that had fallen earlier) I waved the license out the back window.  He comes over and takes it then says ""I will need to see hers"" then walks to his squad car to run me threw the system.  

""Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck...do you have your license?""  ""Don't say fuck right now.""   ""Shit, shit, shit, shit..."".  She doesn't have it.  I just get my pants and shirt on and give her her clothes before the cop comes back.  ""We can't find it.""  ""Well, get your shoes on and step out of the car.""  Oh fucking shit.

I comply as quickly as possible.  After I get out he shines his light toward me and starts asking the standard questions.  ""Address still current, phone number, etc"" then asks...

""Is that your hat?""  ""Hat? Not my hat"" I said quickly as he pointed his flashlight to a red winter wool cap laying on in the snow about 10 feet from the car.  ""I suppose those aren't your empty beers then either?""  ""Uh...No sir!""  At this point I'm pretty sure I detected a bit of a smile cracking the corners of his mouth. 

He then turned to the back window and asked my GF if she was OK.  ""I'm fine"" she assured him from under the blanket.  ""Well, I at least need to see your face miss.""  ""I'm so embarrassed"" she said as she pulled down the the blanked to reveal her beautiful but quite pink face.  ""I just need to make sure you're alright.""  ""Oh, I'm good...I can assure you"" she replied.  Yea, that's a smile he has.

""Well, we've had some burglaries around here recently so I'm going to have to get you guys to leave.""  (Burglaries?  'What'd they steal... uncut trees?' I'm thinking to myself.)  ""Plus, it can be dangerous out here in winter especially if your car won't start.  Best we make sure that thing is working.""  At this point he's got an ear to ear, troll face grin on but I don't care...I've just breathed a big sigh of relief that the end of this is clearly in sight and it doesn't involved calling anyone's parents.

I hop in without closing the drivers door, turn the ignition key and old trusty starts right up.  ""Are we good?  Err free to go?"" ""Sure, drive safe.  The roads are really slick now"".

I shut the door and notice...I can't see shit out of the front window.  Those frozen windows...remember them?  Oh yea.

""Drive!"" says my GF from under the blanket in backseat through what were certainly clenched teeth.  ""I can't see.  The windows are frozen up.""  ""DRIVE!""  No fucking way am I driving out in any manner that might cause me to swerve, veer, go over a curb or anything that would cause this cop to pull me over.  ""DRIVE!""  ""Look, I can't see a thing out the front window.  Are you dressed yet?"" I asked stalling for time.  ""No, just DRIVE"" she begs again.  

I look out the side window and the cop is still standing there.  I'm between a rock and the law.  I open the door, which elicits a ""WTF are you doing"" from my GF, and tell the cop about the window problem.  At this point he finally busts out laughing...""No problem"" he says and goes back to his car.

""I hate you.""  ""Awe honey, I love you.""  For the first time in about 15 minutes I'm smiling for real.  ""I hate you.""  ""Are you dressed?""  ""No, are you driving away yet?""  ""No.""  ""I hate you.""  ""I love you.  Now get dressed.""  ""I'll get dressed when we're out of here fucker.""  ""Awe, this fucker loves you!""  I don't know how long it took to unfreeze the windows but it felt like a good 10 minutes or longer.  To her I'm pretty sure it felt like 30 minutes at least.

After we'd pulled out and were on our way I asked her if she'd brought a red hat with her.  I wasn't going to get it while the cop was there as it was near the beer but if it was her's we could go back for it later.  Nope she hadn't brought one.  The odd thing is it wasn't covered with that fresh snow that had covered the beer.

"c74p8gs","ahh the Zebra plant. I struggled with one of these for 2 years. This is a moderately difficult plant to keep happy, beautiful, but difficult. They require moderate sunlight (reflected direct sun so the leaves dont burn works well). 
This plant is tricky for a couple reasons. One it requires moist soil, but too much watering will give it root rot. It needs about a shot glass of water a day (keep the soil slightly moist unlike other plants where you let it dry in between waterings). They are also very picky, it is the kind of plant that will start dying on you if you move it too much or it gets 'stressed' (because plants lead such difficult lives). I had mine die off completely because I missed a watering once (well Ill be honest it was more like a weekend). All the leaves fell off, it was just a stick in the dirt, but then it came back and grew twice as tall as the first time.

I would recommend finding a nice spot for it where it can stay put and wont get bumped or moved, with good lighting, repot it into a pot with nice drainage and throw in some fertilizer. If it grows well it should grow a nice beautiful flower in the center.

Unfortunately mine did not make it through my last move, but it was one of my favorite plants. And for as annoying as I made them sound, if you dont get lazy with it they will grow fine.

In the seventeenth chapter of Saint Luke it is written ‚Äù the kingdom of God is within man ‚Äù ‚Äì not one man, nor a group of men ‚Äì but in all men ‚Äì in you, the people.

You the people have the power, the power to create machines, the power to create happiness. You the people have the power to make life free and beautiful, to make this life a wonderful adventure. Then in the name of democracy let‚Äôs use that power ‚Äì let us all unite. Let us fight for a new world, a decent world that will give men a chance to work, that will give you the future and old age and security. By the promise of these things, brutes have risen to power, but they lie. They do not fulfil their promise, they never will. Dictators free themselves but they enslave the people. Now let us fight to fulfil that promise. Let us fight to free the world, to do away with national barriers, do away with greed, with hate and intolerance. Let us fight for a world of reason, a world where science and progress will lead to all men‚Äôs happiness!

When I said scientific discovery is beautiful, I meant because it allows us to see the most intimate parts of ourselves, psycological and physical. Nuclear explosions are absolutely beautiful, but scientific discovery doesn't have to be about murder.

I don't see how science is detached from humanity, rather it seems connected. I think it's amazing to see the way we work, and to see the reality in what we percieve.

"c6lynu1","What do you think is the average difference in weight between a slim place like Sweden (one of the thinnest countries in Europe) and an fat place like the United States?

The United States' average BMI is 27.11 (actually probably closer to 26 if you just subset American's of European origin), Sweden's is 23.94. 
http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-18770328

How do these translate to average weights. Take a man of about median height, 5' 9"". In the US the average weight would be about 183 lbs, in Sweden about 162 lbs. That's a difference of 20 lbs. For a median 5'3"" woman the difference would be 15 lbs.

What have I been saying? People have a genetic window of 20-30 lbs based on lifestyle. It's a popular meme that there are no fat people in Europe, but that simply isn't true. The slimmest European countries are no more than 15-20 lbs lighter than the US.

When Americans travel abroad we get a skewed sense of weight distribution because we're only visiting the poshest, wealthiest areas. Stockholm looks very thing and beautiful, but so does Manhattan and San Francisco. Young, thin and beautiful people tend to move to major cities for sociological reasons. 

Overall Europeans have better lifestyles (more exercising especially walking, less junk food), and it's reflected in them being about 15 lbs lighter. But if someone's genetically 100 lbs overweight, perfect lifestyle would only get them to 85 lbs overweight. 

And if you look at the distribution in European countries you see the same effect, the average is shifted but the skew's about the same. That of Swedes 85 lbs overweight is about the same proportion of European Americans who are 100 lbs overweight.

Let me describe my experience with Space Marine and also get shot to hell.  I was most looking forward to the multiplayer.  I did not have a problem with the story, except that after 900 waves of orks I'm not sure why I had to wait so long to get to Chaos enemies.  

The weapons were generally fun although the vengeance gun was clearly not full conceptualized.  

The sparing use of the IG was also a little odd at points as the monotony of killing wave 452 of orks alone was much less thrilling than killing wave 328 with the guard.  Would have also been great if I had to keep them alive.

Getting killed during locked animations is unacceptable.

The lack of a cover mechanic is hotly debated.  I accept that there are modern games that will not include cover.  That is fine.  The stated reasoning behind it, however, is utter BS.  Agreeing with the developer that Space Marines don't hide in cover only makes sense if you have never read a 40k book, read the 40k rulebook, or observed a table top game.  They take cover all the time.  Wanting to keep the action going is fine, don't cloak yourself in BS fluff.  

The multiplayer is an absolute train wreck and anyone who denies it never played on a ps3.  It was actually impossible for me, like so many others, to play multiplayer in the first 3 weeks until they fixed a critical problem with the matchmaker.  It was a terrible experience.

Within multiplayer itself there are also some problems.  Some weapons are essentially useless.  I'm not overly bothered by this because I'd rather they be included if they are in the full game, but I understand many who argue that they should have been made beefier for pvp.

The absolute worst problem is the terrible loading for the customization screen.  You have the option to change your loadout, colors, etc. but it is absolutely impossible-- at least on the ps3 version-- to do that in between games.  The game is designed for you to do this in between games.  This is when you are supposed to make these changes, but it cannot be done.  60 seconds between matches, 45 of those seconds are required to load the customization screen.

I don't have that particular synesthesia but when I read those they totally made sense to me, like a stream of consciousness poem that I'd like to read. I like that you mentioned that weed really amplifies this, and I think the effects of THC on mental functions like creativity and associations between different mental concepts and processes is something that really needs to be studied from the perspective of individuals.

For instance, I haven't found an art form that I am not interested in pursuing, but am primarily a conceptual graphic designer/fine artist and multi instrumentalist musician (I can't stop picking up new instruments instead of concentrating on just one haha.) I hear music in my head pretty much all the time, and it's not just a melody or a song I've heard but full on original compositions with drum sounds/patterns/rhythms, very specific synthesizer tones and compositions (I am a synth dork and audio engineer professionally as well) bass lines (I play 6 string fretted and fretless) and classical, acoustic, and electric guitar chords and melodies. When I smoke, it goes into absolute overdrive and songs are writing themselves in my head faster than I would ever be able to get them down on paper or record them in my studio. At the same time, I'm getting new poetry/lyrics/vocal melodies/harmonies that blend with the song in my head, as well as visual designs that reflect the texture and tone of the music that I could create with photography and illustration that would also represent the subject matter of the lyrics (and typography to match.) It's beautiful but absolutely overwhelming and to date I have only ever succeeded in transcribing bits and pieces of these mind compositions before they're gone from my mind's eye/ear.

It all makes me wonder what strange and beautiful places other people's minds go, and how many people have untold superpowers that could, perhaps, be harnessed to create masterpieces of art or unlock the secrets of the mind.

Neuroscience has a definite stake in this, as THC is an agonist that binds to cannabinoid receptors. Everyone I have witnessed has a demonstrable change in both their outward persona when they partake, and those I've spoken to seem to imply similar changes in their thought processes.

Well it's not the same argument. Apology accepted.

&gt; doesn't mean it can't be improved upon

Of course it can. Better help, better docs, better package and dependency management. Those things are done all the time as incremental improvements.

What is being suggested here (switch from CLI to GUI) does **not** make an improvement. Moreover, you **lose** core functionality in the process.

Tell me, how many of your GUI apps can you easily string together because of input/output piping? Oh that's right, none.

&gt; the user experience of GIT could definitely use some improvements

In what way? The CLI? Or the use of the program itself? The CLI has GUI counterparts, of which I provided a list to many of them. Go push buttons if you want. Some are actually quite intuitive and beautiful.

But if you're actually criticizing the functionality of the whole git system, I really have to ask, what do you expect? What is it making harder that you think should be easier? What is it not doing that you think it should be doing? In what way does the paradigm of DVCS not make sense?

I think you'll find the answer to most of your frustration is that you simply do not know enough about the topic at hand. That's not ""user interface"". That's ""user education"".

*This Section should go step-by-step. You have to approach it like explaining the most basic things, just because you understood doesn't the other person will understand that easily*

* The five pillars of Islam - Then explain each one in detail.
* More details about Tawheed
* Link to read the quran - I would personally recommend quran.com because the site layout is simple and beautiful, but there are other websites which should also be mentioned in order to understand the quran with tafseer (I herd Nouman Ali Khan, and there are many more I seen our Brother and Sisters post here in this subreddit)
* Link to Books they would like to read to learn about the life of Prophet Mohammad[](/pbuh) eg. (The Sealed Nectar): Biography of the Prophet available on amazon.
* If you want links to online video series on the seerah, I have a good source I like that I could share if you want.


**For People looking for more information:-**

* How to perform a Salat (Step by Step: provide links, and video tutorial especially)
* Links to Hadiths by Bukhari and 
* Daily day to day lives of Muslims - pretty simple not much here (eg. Salat, Code of conduct)
* The Big NO-NO's for Muslims


**Commonly Asked Questions about minor things like the FAQs:-**

* What must one do to become a Muslim (Pretty Simple).
* What is Halal, and why do Muslims eat Halal.
* What is Sharia?
* How is Islam Related to other Abrahamic Religions. How is it different
* Marrying a Muslim guy or girl

Society has changed a lot. ""Once upon a time..."" the only chance someone had to enjoy non folk music was going to concerts to listen to true masters and virtuosos showing their skill with complex and difficult pieces.

Nowadays, ready access to that kind of musical ability can be found everywhere. 7+ thousand million human beings in this planet now, makes it hard not to.

"c4qt5c3","My psychological, in no particular order:

*  People in their 20s are insufferable. Its the same 'identity politics' opinions like they churn these kids out of factory somewhere. The typical poltiicans with easy answers to big problems become their saints. Dealing with a mature or original young person is pretty amazing, but they're rare. 
*  Older people are the same but replace social issues with taxes. No one I know who makes over 250k votes Democrat. Not one, even though they did when they were poorer and tend to hold very liberal social views, but that idea of saving 1% on your taxes is like crack to them. You learn that all politics and even morality are just economics with a different name.
*  You realize every conspiracy theory is wrong solely because every single project run by any government or corporation is a hodgepodge fuckall mess of project managers, greedy vendors, pathetic middle management, clueless upper management, lazy workers, dumb workers, uninspired workers, etc which all means delays and craziness. You need to learn patience and a tolerance for the medoicre to survive in even a good company.  This is also why a startup run by 4 college students can topple giants and have 100 billion dollar IPOs. We suck that badly. All companies are salary making machines for the dumb and tired old.
*  Their music terrible. So was yours but at least you can point at popular bands that have broken through to more avante garde heights or indie bands or whatever.  Meeting a young music lover who transcends this is amazing as well.
*  You realize that you used to be money poor, but now you're money rich and time poor.  That 4 week vacation will never happen so get good at planning 6 day trips once or twice a year.  If you're american you'll always get the evil eye when you ask for this time off. We don't value travel.
*  You realize that no one is in charge. Everything is committes, democracies, focus groups, associations, congresses, parliaments, etc. You accept that you're one bad election from war, slavery, and starvation. You just chug along and hope the political winds of change don't get too extremist in your lifetime. You realize that if ""The Man"" exists its you and everyone else who values that status quo for a paycheck and political stability.
*  You accept death in all its frightening glory. You've seen your parents die and some friends by now. You've seen friends win and lose the cancer war. You see the ups and down ""Oh the chemo is working"" and then its not and you're breaking out your funeral suit AGAIN.  Now death is staring you in the face everyday. You cannot ignore it any longer. You can mock guys for having 'midlife crisises' but you'll probably have one too.  
*  You're still attracted to the young and beautiful, but its like some faustian bargain, they're almost all dumb and clueless and way too young for you. Even if you were to go with one you'd be shunned because you're dating outside your age range.
*  You accept that you need a cemetary plot and a will and all that stuff. Its done casually in a lawyer's office. You could never imagine doing this so casually. You may need to fight with relatives over inheritance and trust me, you'll become a stereotypical asshole as well. During this whole time you're numb inside.
*  You no longer tolerate noise and crowds. You wonder how anyone does.
*  You no longer believe that science is 10 years away from giving you an immortal robot body or breaking the light barrier. You accept that humanity will just shuffle along per usual. Births, deaths, wars, etc to the meaningless goal of survival.
*  You get to meet some really rich and successful people. They are miserable just like you.  There's no magic bullet here.  Sometimes you meet some really positive older folk and you think 'Wow, I want to be like you.'
*  You've had your first set of health scares. You body is now this rotting thing that is trying to kill you. You try not to think about that often.
*  You've met some of your heroes. You understand what 'never meet your heroes' actually means now.
*  You've met some powerful people and you realize how much of a sham power is. We give it up so easily and like to proclaim ""These are our alpha males and alpha females!""  Its such a huge sham you wonder how society stays together.
*  You live long enough to see history repeat itself.  Vietnam becomes Iraq. Iran will be someone's Iraq.  Turns out dumb political tricks work almost everytime.
*  You live long enough to see token progress but everything else is the same. You realize that the progressive nature of things you were taught in school was a sham. We're not going towards a Star Trek like future, if fact we have just as good of a chance to regress into theocracy and barbarism.
*  You see people you love change. Your cool friend is now a strict catholic asking when you're having kids. You don't want kids, you're still a fucking kid inside.
*  You learn that with 10,000 hours you can get good at things. You get good at 2 or 3 things. You realize that being good at something is a lot less fulfilling than you thought it was.  You realize you cna only get good at 2 or 3 things before your death.
*  You see far off national goals like asteroid landings in 2030 and think ""I'll probably be alive then, right?""
*  You've lived long enough to try some business ideas and realize that you'll never be rich and working until 65 is a optimistic scenario. In real life people dont drop out of society to become amazing artists. The guy thats 45 in your improv class will never be on stage or tv, he's just too old. The 22 year old blonde probably will be. He's a million times funnier than her.
*  You've had several dogs and your current one will be dead soon, so you're extra nice to dogs because they have such short lives. The idea of hurting an animal fills you with rage.
*  When a younger person is lying to you or trying to scam you its 100% obvious to you and they think they're being convincing. You just kinda sit there with a glazed look thinking ""Wow, are we actually doing this?""
*  Social rules and ettiquitte are supremely important. Those who dont thank or are rude are instaltly hated by you.  You are super sensitive to those who don't respect you as the older silverback gorilla you are. If the young do it, it makes you crazy even though you know they aren't doing it on purpose.
*  You realize that a little compassion goes a long way.  You're nicer and any toughguy persona is only there for emergencies. You despise guys your age still acting like toughguys. Its pathetic.
*  You wake up one day and go from being the youngest guy in the meeting to the oldest guy in the meeting.  No one prepares you for ths. All these young guys are expecting you to lead them when you barely figured this stuff out in the first place back when you were in their shoes.

"c4mpm8e","Personally, at first the One X was too much. The screen was huge and beautiful, but i didn't know if i could make it work.

Unfortunately, i got a dodgy model and had to send it back for a replacement. So during this time, i became reacquainted with my Atrix 4g which has a 4 inch screen. And I can assure you, the difference is noticeable in terms of comfort. I never considered my Atrix small or uncomfortable by any means, but i just can't get over how *good* the One X feels.

You have more then enough room to type, game, and watch movies. The case is slightly curved which makes all the difference in terms of comfort. I have never considered myself much of a mobile gamer, but my One X has changed that. Tegra games are amazing, and the device is just so smooth.

I know a lot of people will bash Sense, but i personally find it better then any manufactures skin that I've ever touched. But that can't go without saying, the development on this phone is goddamn amazing. Within a week of the phone being released there was a full CM9 port, and HTC has been regularly updating the software; The phone has been released for just over 4 weeks and received an update almost every week.

This phone is possibly the best phone i have ever had the pleasure of holding. In saying that though, there's always going to be a better phone around the corner. Sony are getting better with android and I'm looking forward to see how the device preforms.. to an extent, along with Samsungs new Galaxy 3 well.

Just keep in mind, i'll still like you no matter what choice you make.

"c4mi3fe","Alright, here's my stance in the biology and some personal anecdote. 

We have so little idea how intelligence is inherited it isn't even funny. I'm not a neuroscientist, I'm a botanist, but I do know a bit about this whole genetic code thing. Sure, we've mapped the human genome. Big deal, that isn't the important part. What we don't know is how all of it comes together to make a human being. The simple Mendelian inheritance that people (hopefully) learn in highschool is awesome and elegant and beautiful, but that little punnet square isn't at all how most inheritance works. We have no idea what genes constitute ""intelligence"". For all we know, the genetic code just makes the very basic brain layout and *everything* past that point is nurture. Everything. Idiots and geniuses have been reproducing since the dawn of modern man; geniuses have raised idiots and idiots have raised geniuses. Eugenics doesn't work, it's just a way for the ruling majority to make sure their favorite people reproduce. 

On the anecdotal side of things, I point to my life and my parents. For the majority of my life, my father was out of the picture on business trips or working or whatever. In the little time he did spend at home he managed to instill me with several triggers that make me instantly start bawling. Very literally, things about me that are crazy. Intelligent as he is, had I been raised by him I would have become a pile of insecurities and neurotic ticks (more than I am now, anyway). My mother isn't particularly bright, but she has a warmth and strength of character that makes her the best mom in the world. She hasn't been able to help me with math since 6th grade and still doesn't understand how I calculated her miles per gallon for her, but she raised two daughters at the top of their fields (even if my sister is a theology major and a total bitch, she's damn smart). 

What's important in parenting isn't the genes that you bring to the brew, but the way you raise your kids. I'd love if there were free parenting classes for new/prospective parents, but restricting reproductive rights for intelligence is ludicrous. My two cents. Wow, that was long.

"c4kgmfx","My BF and I had a similar discussion once. His argument is that ""guys are usually hitting on you when they say, and it's disrespect to hit on you in front of me."" I can get behind that mentality, but you still have to draw the line that a friend can call you beautiful and it can be okay. You have to decide if you think your friend has impure intentions behind it or not. There are some friends I like calling me beautiful, but other 'friends' or guys can't because they have feelings for me and have made that clear. 

Just reverse it. If a girl came up to your BF and said, ""Hey handsome"", would you want her to stop? I'm sure you'd ask yourself the questions of, 1) What are her intentions?, 2) Is she saying it in a flirty way and touching him while doing it?, 3) Does she have feelings for him and does this change the context of 'hey handsome' into something more than that?

Anyways, I think he's over-reacting. You can't stop people from complimenting you. You didn't say ""hey beautiful"" back or acknowledge the 'beautiful' part.

"c4bta0j","Those aren't really good examples.  The Pippin was created while Jobs was away from the company; so too the Newton.  He cancelled both those products almost instantaneously when he re-joined Apple.

That said, I wouldn't even disagree with you.  Apple has made mistakes in the past, no doubt.  (For example, the Powermac G4 cube -- a beautiful but overpriced and underpowered device; MobileMe -- something Jobs said ""tarnished the image of the company."")  As Jobs said back in '97 -- ""we're going to make some mistakes along the way.""

That was never the point though.  The point was (as someone has already alluded to) Apple's success has *not* come from running market surveys and sticking their finger into the wind and saying ""gee, what are people demanding right now.""  Apple has *created* markets -- they play for the future.  And that's what you need for a company to thrive.  Don't confuse good customer service (which means responding to customer concerns -- something Sony does need to address) with good product planning (which means creating rather than kowtowing to markets). 

Examples: The original Macintosh.  Consumers were not running around in 1983 saying ""oh my God, please give us personal computers.""  Computers were in two markets at that point: hobbyists and businesses.  Apple created the idea of a robust consumer market with the Macintosh.

The iPad.  Think back to 2009.  There wasn't this huge pent-up demand for a tablet.  In fact, tablets were looked at with a good measure of suspicion.  Microsoft had been trying to make a successful tablet for a few years (with clunky hardware and few sales to show from it).  The hot thing was predicted to be this new segment called the ""netbook.""  Apple created a tablet market with its launch of the iPad.


Mobile music sales.  A significant portion of Apple's iTunes revenue comes from people purchasing music from a mobile device.  When this concept was introduced, people scoffed.  (In fact, Jobs himself had said at an earlier point something along the lines of ""who wants to buy music from a tiny screen?"")  The past examples of other companies' efforts to create mobile music markets (often through idiotic subscription services) made everyone very cool to the concept.  But the market took off with Apple's efforts.

Market leaders **lead**.  That's been the key to Apple's success.  At one time, Sony was also a leader.

"c47by9l","Dear fellas: you have been duped.

You've been trained to like tanned skin. The girls who think guys will find them ugly if they're pale are dumb and clearly out of touch with the actual reason girls have conditioned guys to be attracted to a tan. 

Pale skin makes it very hard to hide imperfections. Got a spot on your shoulder? It'll stand out like a neon sign. Smooth, milky skin is beautiful, but pale, blotchy skin is less so. 

So women started tanning to cover up the imperfections, hoping fellas would eventually think it was actually more attractive than being pale. And it worked, surprisingly. Of course now the backlash is starting to happen because some guys always want to be attracted to whatever's not the majority at the moment. 

Now all this is coming from a very, very pale girl because I think I look prettier without a tan too, but sometimes feel envious of the seemingly flawless bronze godesses of today.

* Blackberry phones are solidly built. You often times see people using their blackberries that are years old and they work fine. They are not made of beautiful but fragile materials like some other smart phones, and neither do I ever feel that RIM cut corners using inferior materials on their Blackberry. I mean, where I live, every police officers I see are using a blackberry! That's got to say something about the reliability and toughness of blackberry phones.
* Mail BBM and Social Networking Apps. At first, I didn't think that I would use these at all. However, as I got used to my blackberry, I couldn't imagine not having them. BBM? there's a reason why people pick blackberry just for BBM. I love BBM. Mail? I didn't use my email much before, but now I find myself actually using it and I love using emails now. Social Networking Apps? I'll be honest, I still don't use them a lot, but I've grown to like and use Twitter a lot, and the app works well on blackberries.
* They are sexy. I really think they are some of the best looking phones out there. All these other phones are just a square with a touch screen taking up the real estate. They're all the same. RIM seems to be one of the few companies that are making phones that really stand out from the rest nowadays. The only other companies I can really think of off the top of my head are HTC? Samsung with the Note maybe? Nokia?
* Security. I know people may not really care about security, but it really is good on a blackberry. You can change settings to most apps to allow or not allow them to access any information on your phone. You can encrypt everything, and if you really need to get rid of every information on your phone, you can security wipe. Good features that are god to have in my opinion.
* One of the few smart phones you can actually use to its full extent while wearing gloves. When I go snowboarding, hiking, or running at night, those physical keypads work perfectly while I am wearing gloves. Also, in my opinion actual keypads with backlights are superior to touchscreen keypads. 


I was fortunate to have friends that do not care what phones people use and were very interested in my blackberry, and supported my purchase.

* [Nakagawa ShokoÔºà‰∏≠Â∑ùÁøîÂ≠êÔºâ](http://ameblo.jp/nakagawa-shoko/) (aka Shokotan), because she's so weird and doesn't even look real (and milks that very effectively). I like her in the [Tri-Terasu ads](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcIQqZ6ICxo) and the old [Promise ads](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOTNXLiPzlk). 

* Ito Asako Ôºà„ÅÑ„Å®„ÅÜ „ÅÇ„Åï„ÅìÔºâ(o-warai geinin--her act is that silly blue leotard and black leggings and one of those... ribbons on sticks or whatever), but I'm not sure why. She has nice sparkly eyes and a great smile and nice skin and seems to work hard and play hard. Just... I just like her for some reason. No link because most of the pics around of her are in her act, which doesn't really reflect what I'm talking about.

* [Kanno MihoÔºàËèÖÈáéÁæéÁ©ÇÔºâ](http://www.ken-on.co.jp/kanno/) (actress), because I think she's adorable. She's sometimes on ‰∏ñÁïå!Âºæ‰∏∏„Éà„É©„Éô„É©„Éº, which I'm sometimes awake enough to watch, and she just takes such pleasure in everything--an honest, open pleasure. She talks to people in her bad English without fear, and genuinely seems to appreciate and enjoy the world. I just think she's really neat. I first fell for her in when [she went to Sweden](http://www.woopie.jp/video/watch/20f80e28d9b7dca0) to see the northern lights, and she was drinking vodka in the ice hotel and dancing around shouting „ÄåÊ•Ω„Åó„ÅÑ„ÄúÔºÅ„Äçand spilling it all over gloves. I don't actually think she's that attractive, physically. But she's just so much fun.

* [KoyukiÔºàÂ∞èÈõ™Ôºâ](http://koyuki.jp/) (actress), but actually I think the reason is just that my wife accused me of liking her so long that I mis-remembered that I liked her. I used to stare in horror at that schnoz, but now it's rather grown on me.

* [Dan ReiÔºàÊ™Ä„Çå„ÅÑÔºâ](http://www.shochiku-enta.co.jp/actress/dan/) (actress), because of those Suntory beer ads where she plays the black widow who [lures unsuspecting men](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xg1qkmUnL3o&amp;t=3m17s) to marry her and take up residence in her [drafty country home](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xg1qkmUnL3o&amp;t=3m30s), and the first time they come home after willing all their money to her in the event of their death, she [serves them a poisoned beer](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WWf5f93OTM) and they drift off to sleep, happy and content in the love of a beautiful woman who is devoted to them absolutely, and who they can take good care of forever. Then their hearts stop beating as they slip into that eternal dream and she cuts their bodies up and feeds them to her pigs before trolling the net for another victim.

* [Isono Kiriko](http://www.ishii-mitsuzo.com/talent/isono/index.html) (o-warai geinin), because I actually think she's really beautiful, but more than that, she's loud. Basically, I like women who have strong personalities and who speak their mind. Out of all of this list, she's probably the only one I would actually be interested in in real life, I think. 

* [Ayase Haruka](http://horipro.co.jp/talent/PF061/index.php) (actress), because if you've ever seen her unscripted, she's just a total cutie. Not sexy at all. Clumsy, goofy, and weird. (I realize I'm doing the Zooey Deschanel thing here--pretending that the weirdness is the number one thing and the appearance has nothing to do with it.) But what I really like about her appearance is that her right eye is considerably smaller than her left. I hope she never ""fixes"" it. It's our imperfections that make us beautiful, I think. Like Koyuki's formidable nose or Kirsten Dunst's teeth, without that little deviation from ""ideal,"" there's nothing interesting about the face at all. Perfect is boring.

* [Tsuchiya Anna](http://anna-t.com/index.html)ÔºàÂúüÂ±ã„Ç¢„É≥„ÉäÔºâ(model/singer--who can actually sing), because she's way too cool for me. She's the kind of girl I'd be great friends with, but would have no shot at dating. She's both very sexy, but also so masculine. She pounds beer and gets too sunburned. She talks like a tough guy. She named her first kid Sky and raised him in izakayas. She understands that rock is an attitude, not a music style. She looks as at home in high-fashion magazines and camping with [Hamaguchi Masaru on a deserted island](http://v.youku.com/v_show/id_XMzQ3MDAyNjY0.html) (ripping off her false nails to cook).

--So there's a list. I don't obsess over these people or anything, and I don't know anything more about them than what is written here. 

Oh, honorable mention, despite being straight (although I might make an exception in this case):

* [Narimiya Hiroki](http://www.topcoat.co.jp/profile/index.php?a=4)ÔºàÊàêÂÆÆÂØõË≤¥Ôºâ(""actor,"" despite being *fucking terrible*), because he's *fucking hot.* Also, I am one of the many guys in Japan who wants his hair. I can't get it to do that, though... That kind of classic part that still succeeds in being edgy... It's simultaneously masculine and kind of fabulous. There is *no way* that boy is straight though. No straight guy looks that good.


ADDENDUM: I want to make it clear that I actually had to look most of these people's names up based on whatever commercial they're in.

"c3ocgcr","Hehe, I teach math and physics, but I have been drafted as a substitute in Danish on a few occasions.

I handed out a songtext that was relatively new (2009 - if it's much older, it's too old), called ""S√¶kken i katten"".

There's a problem there, but I think a couple of translations could help out.

You know the expression ""pig in a poke""? The Danish equivalent is ""Katten i s√¶kken"" (the cat in the bag). ""S√¶kken"" is slang for ""the bitch"", and by re-arranging the words, the title implies that the women who's the protagonist, has a bit of a bitch inside (and is able to let it out at will), but all of the students just assumed that there was an error in the title, and that they'd always heard it wrong. 

I guess it would be the same if there was a English song with the title ""poke in a pig"". 

I started out with that, asking questions like those they must eventually learn to ask themselves: ""Could it be on purpose? What does the word ""s√¶k"" mean? What *is* a ""kat"". Can a person be a bitch *inside*?""

After that, I asked them to underline two types of things in the text in different ways - one type of underlining for things that are open to interpretation, and one type of underlining for things that are not open to interpretation.

Most of the students did it right - there were references to some guy trying to be a lion tamer, big game hunter, chasing her through the town, etcetera. They all saw that this was exaggeration, and did a good job on interpreting this into something else.

The more difficult part was the non-interpretable things, but we all agreed that the line ""They call her the queen of the night"" was uninterpretable. They *do* call her the queen of the night.

But we had a bit of fun trying to guess *why*. I asked them to pull out their cellphones and google ""queen of the night"". 

* Some students found that it was a cactus, and thought that it was actually pretty good - beautiful but prickly.

* some students found out that it was a common phrase in the drag-queen culture, and that lent a *whole* new meaning to the entire song.  I was surprised.

* None of the students found that it was a reference to a 1950 poem about city life written by one of our much-beloved national artists (which would have been my favorite interpretation, but it's *their* lesson, and *they* get to decide what interpretation to use)

After the lesson, I asked them how many of them were certain that they knew what the song *really* was about. After some hesitant hands slowly came up, I said: ""you put your hand up, but you did so quite slowly - like you weren't 100% sure that you were certain"" (trying to make them agree that they weren't quite sure), and then followed up with: ""Good. If you haven't decided yet, that means you're not stubborn about your opinions *and* you're ready to learn more"" (or something like that - there's a whole lexicon about classroom culture as contained in the teachers mannerisms, that I am never going to be able to write)

Anyway, when it comes to interpretations, it's hard to remember how difficult it could actually be, and the key must be to take it in gradual steps, and always make certain that every step has an interesting bonus.

**Spoilers for those who haven't played LoZ: Link's Awakening**
I was young when I first finished Link's Awakening, but I still remember it quite distinctly. I was in a car on the way to visit some family, and I started bawling as I had finished the game. It was just a beautiful, but sad ending to a game, and to this day remains my favorite 'sad moment' of any game I've played.

For some reason the way Link's Awakening ended felt so final. I had enjoyed crawling my way through the dungeons, interacting with the residents of Koholint Island, and ultimately feeling a part of a (what seemed to me at the time) living, breathing environment. And then when you finish the game and it all disappears as the dreamer wakes.  Every now and then I replay the game and it still makes me feel sad in a way other games aren't able to.",1327602266,"it was just a beautiful, but sad ending to a game, and to this day remains my favorite 'sad moment' of any game i've played.","beautiful, but sad","beautiful","but",TRUE,"beautiful , but sad","sad",NA,NA,1

That being said, my fairy tale was my grandparents. My grandfather died before I was born, but I have grown up hearing about him from my grandmother. Who just adores him. Even after three decades, she still talks about him like he is in the other room. ""Oh, Ed would just love this dinner."" ""I wonder what Ed would say if he saw this silly movie about Johnny Cash."" I always thought it was tragic, but beautiful that she never even dated after he died, even though she was in her 40sand still very beautiful.

But recently, I found letters they had been writing in the years before his death (he was in Vietnam). The letters weren't organized, and I only had his to go through because he didn't bring hers home.But they were arguing about my uncle. My grandfather wanted to cut him off, stop supporting his irresponsible lifestyle. And based on his tone in the numerous letters, my grandmother was taking the stance of, ""I'm the one here and I will parent how I like."" It was a surprise to me that their relationship had rocky periods. That they would so strongly disagree, and actually be snippy with each other. It reminded me that they had a real relationship with ups and downs.

Some women do want body builders. But those women are usually trash and have issues way beyond the usual daddy ones. 

You would have thought if you were going to that sort of effort to get women, and its sad you need to go to that amount of effort to get women, you'd do some research.

"c3h9cs1","&gt;In addition, ""designer"" stuff baffles me. Everything manmade has a designer. So why spend more on designer clothes?

I think saying that ""everything man made has a designer"" is a little misleading in this case. Everything man made has a creator, sure, but that's usually not what people mean when they talk about designers. Designers, in some sense, transcend mere creation. In the same way that, say, artisans transcend mere creation. Since you're already hostile towards the idea of designer fashion, let me give you another example. You can probably go to Wal-Mart and get a chef's knife for $10. Why spend more on a knife, then? Well, that $10 knife is made of lower quality steel, it doesn't hold an edge very well, the angle is going to be very wide, and so on. If these things don't matter to you, then it obviously makes no sense to spend more than $10. However, if they do, then you better be prepared to spend more money. This is only from a practical perspective. If you're also interested in a knife that's not only more practical but also more beautiful, then you're going to have to spend even more money.

I mean you're speaking in generalities thought, not all guys are like that, BUT even if they were, we've still seen societies where masculinity was highly prized and seen as beautiful. 

You're also talking about your orientation like it's a universal beauty standard. You think women are ""hotter"" because society has told you that. 

Now your ATTRACTION isn't based in society, BUT what you think is more beautiful is based in large part on beauty standards. 

If your whole life you'd been told ""Men are more prized, men are more beautiful"", you'd probably admit, ""Yea, the male form is amazing and beautiful, but I still love women.""

"c360tr1","This rant may contain a couple of minor spoilers but hopefully nothing major. But I'd encourage you to read it and tell me if you agree / disagree, and why. 

So. Disappointments? Well, there was hardly any plot, with nothing surprising happening, aggravating controls, rehashed, and repetitive concepts and locations for puzzles and dungeons. This is added to by the fact that absolutely zero of it was challenging whatsoever (except due to controller issues) because the sidekick with zero personality tells you exactly what to do every damn step of the way, with a flimsy, tired veil of 'x% chance'. There's a 100% chance I'd like to figure this one out by myself, Fi, thanks.

Someone else mentioned motion control for the sake of it, and to be fair the sword controls DO work amazingly, I won't deny that. But swimming. And flying. And the beetle. And trying to get your sword pointing straight up. And throwing bombs. And trying to catch bugs. And playing the harp. And drawing on walls. And selecting your item from the +/- menus. And skydiving. And accidentally drinking potions because you hit one wrong button. The bow has practically become redundant in battle because you can't be expected to use it under timed conditions.

Seriously, am I the only one that was so frustrated by the controls in this game that I genuinely didn't enjoy it for extended periods of time? Oh, let me fly through boring empty sky between the town and the isle of weird ballet dancing again. Oh, my bird is now turning in the wrong direction for a complete circle? Well this is fucking frustrating. At least there's flying centipedes I can flounder about next to, making up for the total lack of enemies or interesting islands in the sky!

And the stamina meter? Oh good, I was repeatedly hit by the most basic of enemies because my lime inexplicably ran out. Seriously, the only reason I didn't die more was because they gave you an inordinate amount of heart pieces for NO work or thought, and you take *very* little damage. No thanks to the unwieldy shield, rendered almost entirely useless by the nunchuck's dodgy shake feature and the time it takes to deploy. And don't get me wrong, I know how to use the controls, I just don't have the patience some of you seem to have when they don't work. 

This really got to me though. The weird child-friendly thing you're trying to do, Nintendo? It doesn't fit Zelda, and it never will. You can make the graphics as silly as you like; Wind Waker was bright and beautiful but still challenging and mature. But dumbing it down to this level is just sad. Short dungeons with no real challenge, a non-stop walkthrough that lives in your sword (plus the cheat-stone), and sidequests that are nothing more than fetch-quest filler fit for an ADHD generation of spoonfed kids. Don't start me on the [tentacle boss that looks like a Disney character](/spoiler). That could have been so much better.

But my main issue was the plot. Come on, Nintendo, you gave us the ground breaking Ocarina a of Time, the creepy, tragic Majora's Mask, the utterly fantastic, almost endless Wind Waker, the dark, weird Twilight Princess, then *this*? Do you know what I *thought* was going to happen? I thought that you'd beat Demise with the help of both Groose **and** Zelda, and then each of you vows to carry/guard part of the triforce to keep it safe. It's an emotional and legendary task, but the three of the core characters take it upon themselves to do it for the sake of everyone in the land.

And then, *twist*, it transpires that Demise, in one final act of evil, cursed the triforce of Power, which Groose inherits, and it turns him into Ganondorf, eternally damned and consumed by an inherent need to capture and defeat Zelda, the one thing he desired but could never have. Their struggle lasts through the ages, repeated time and time again, the story retold but always the same. Demise becomes the origin of Ganon, and quite nicely explains the whole ganon/link/zelda triangle. And the triforce. And the fact that it always repeats itself. I think.

I dare any of you to tell me that wouldn't be a more interesting ending than what we got :(",1323246079,"you can make the graphics as silly as you like; wind waker was bright and beautiful but still challenging and mature.","bright and beautiful","beautiful",NA,FALSE,"bright and beautiful","bright",NA,NA,0
"c35zi1c","I recommend Iceland.  I have a specific suggestion for a place to say, simply because I happen to have stayed there and I think it meets many of your requirements.  If you go to Iceland though, I'm sure you'd do a bit of travelling about the country.

I lived in Iceland for 1 year and spent a weekend with friends at Snorrasta√∞ir once:  http://snorrastadir.is/eng/ahugavert.htm  They're summer cottages, have kitchens, affordable, near some very pretty scenery and hikes.  Only about 2 hours drive from Reykjavik, the capital, where you can satisfy the cosmopolitan side of the trip e.g. food.

The cottages I mentioned have hot pots.  Iceland is also full of incredible hot baths both natural and at pools (super modern, super clean, highly recommended).

Iceland is a beautiful place, lots of nature, summers are beautiful but short and cool.  Sun is up all the time which is a bonus for most people vacationing---bring sleeping mask though :-)  The countryside near the Snorrasta√∞ir cottages is gorgeous.  Easy access to Sn√¶fellsness peninsula; Gl√Ωmur waterful is also nearby and is incredible.   Google those.  Internet might not(?) be available at that place but it is readily available throughout Iceland, including all hotels and free at all coffeeshops/gas stations.

Food in Reykjavik is varied and delicious.  Icelandic food is unique.  Much is very good.  Some is very bad.  Don't believe the brochures, most Icelanders eat the good food :-)  Ummm lots more I could say but that is plenty already.

"c31bbf9","I looked more into the topic just now. You're right, there are some citing by apostles. (They are a set of 12 higher up leaders that council with the church president, modeled after Jesus and his 12).

One of my biggest critiques against my church is actually the inconsistency. First Jesus was supposed to return to Jackson Missouri when he did come so they tried to establish a colony there (in the honestly beautiful but largely uninhabited area.) Then all of a sudden everyone had to move out west when they were sentenced the extermination order. And obviously the massive polygamy thing I'm sure you're aware of. And I'll tell you now there are several examples of more contradictions in the old old church published, but not necessarily church written or god inspired book. Now all of the examples I put forth aren't too much for me to be comfortable with with a legitimate explanation, but for most of them there aren't any presented *yet*.

That said be well aware of all of the older so called divine experiences of other religions. I'm sure you can dig old an old tome from the 13th century and find a lot of inconsistencies with Catholicism or Islam. I'll tell you at the least that the married Jesus thing isn't a mainstream belief. There are a lot of older men who I think frankly are so wrapped up in their beliefs, so dedicated they won't consider another side, and this is the group that forms several of the more ridiculous more non-canon beliefs that they see as making a more incredible awe inspiring god. 

There is also an idea that goes around within the church that some of the doctrine isn't for any Joe-Schmoe to read. They only for once you've gained a close relationship with God, otherwise you won't be able to get anything divine out of it.

"c2zukri","I tried reading this but my time is too important to be wasted on such drivel.  I will however donate some of my time to express a rational and non-religious reason to oppose pornography.

I think sex between two humans is healthy and beautiful, but I find a number of problems with pornography.  First, I should say that I grew up on a farm so I learned at an early age what sexual behaviour in animals consisted of.  I don't mind that humans behave sexually in the same manner as goats (although you might if you bothered to think about it), but I don't think it's something that is worthy of pride, praise, or public exhibition.

Pornography wastes time that could be used in far more productive ways.  Life is finite, and there are a lot of things we could be doing to improve ourselves, our local communities, and our nation.  There appears to be a lot of problems in the world and I'd hate to think that while the ship is sinking we're all beating off instead of trying to patch the holes.

Natural sexuality between two people (in a world without porn) is a special discovery with a kind of high you can't get if you already have a bunch of bizarre preconceptions about what sex is supposed to be about.  Pornography perverts and destroys this.  It presents a picture of humanity that is purely degenerative.  Is this really how we want to see ourselves?  as granny f*ckers and cuckolds?  The argument against porn is about having self-respect and respect for others -- it has nothing to do with 'freedom'.  Should you have the freedom to be a degenerate?  Yes, I believe you should, but why would you want to?

What do you suppose the psychological consequences of pornography are?   Apart from creating an acceptance for degradation and perversity, I will go so far as to say that it reinforces it:  If orgasm follows perverse fantasy/acts it will serve as a positive reinforcer of this behaviour.  If you want details you can read what B.F. Skinner has to say on the topic of Behaviourism.   What this basically boils down to is that through excessive reinforcement of bizarre themes we are making ourselves want/need them more.  What do you suppose the impact will be of rewarding yourself for having hateful and degrading (to yourself or others) fantasies? 

One aspect of pornography that is rarely considered is how degrading it is to the viewer.  You might have wondered ""why does the porn actress always look directly into the camera?"".  This breaking of the 'fourth' wall is an invitation for the viewer to be part of the scene.  It is interesting to note the nature of the camera shots, especially the prevalence of those from below.  I have always wondered if pornography is taking normal 'top' guys and turning them into 'bottoms'.  Nevertheless, if you care to analyse the shots you will see that the viewer is usually degraded as much or more than the actors/actresses.

It could be suggested that pornography is a kind of subversive psychological abuse.  But you want the freedom to be vulgar degenerates, right?  let's not inhibit our sexuality!  and while we're at it, maybe we should stop inhibiting rapists as well?

Nevertheless, you will have to excuse my judgements.  You can do yourself a favour and have normal sexual relations with real humans -- if you still can?  or are you already addicted?  think I'm full of BS?  why don't you try stopping and see how easy it is.",1321329056,"i think sex between two humans is healthy and beautiful, but i find a number of problems with pornography.","healthy and beautiful","beautiful",NA,FALSE,"healthy and beautiful","healthy",NA,NA,0

The thing is, I don't want mechanical or elephant to be litteral in their terms. 

I came up with the band name of 'elephant' a couple of years back while searching at a car boot sale for musical instruments. I found a guy selling redundant old letterpress stamps. My original thought was to take a few and sort of 'remix' the original typography into a band name. Then I saw the stamp that read 'elephant' in capital letters and was sold.

After a while I needed to add to a name like 'elephant' due to it being too simple and unsearchable (google wise). My girlfriend pointed out casually that there was a bar called the Mechanical Elephant and ever since, the name has stuck with me. I enjoyed the name so much because of the mixture of contrasting and complimenting features of the words. One word being elephant; natural, beautiful, but also big and demanding. The other mechanical; unnatural and processed, but also big and overpowering.

I must say, since the very beginning I've loved chrome, she's really beautiful and simplistic, her dressing style is really great, and she actually changed some of her clothes because she knew what I liked. she's really helpful and caring in so many situations, I left opera for her and I must say I quite missed some of the moves she knew of, and chrome actually went on to learning those moves!! she's not the slightest bit jealous in any way and that is really great I really love her and wouldn't leave her for anything in the world. I went with her sister Rockmelt once, she was pretty reserved at the time so I kinda felt special when she showed me some attention but now she's with everyone she can get to... and well she's nothing like chrome. oh and you know what? if you tell can tell chrome all your dirty secrets and you tell her to not say it to anyone she actually wont she's really good at keeping secrets! not like many of those other browsers that go full retard and then just say absolutely nothing about you.

I know what you're thinking ""you where with her from the very start? but she was so stupid there!"" yes... she had some weird habits and did do a lot of different stuff that I didn't quite understood why she had to. and she acted up a lot of times as well, but staying with her have REALLY been rewarding, she is really good at learning new stuff too! and she knows of so many great places.

IE:well, she was my first, I actually thought there was no other but her, she was kind of oppressive and jealous, and yes she is a bit slow, and take up a lot of your personal space, I don't like her like that any more, but she has always been there for me and therefore we're friends, if chrome is taking a nap, or feeling sick, and I can't talk to her for the day, I take a quick step over at ie's and we have a drink or two, but we don't get intimate in any way, I stay completely loyal to chrome. and I must say, she has aged really well, chrome is young and beautiful. but ie has become much less oppressive and when I'm over at a friends house and forgot to bring chrome, IE knows her number and makes sure she comes over right away. the landlord of my now being residence Windows, do though all the time try to get me and IE back together, it's kind of annoying at times, but she is after all her daughter, and it's not like at mac's place where he almost force his daughter safari on top of you.

IE and I have had a great time, I really think more people should give her another chance.

opera: I was with her, she's really great believe me. She really listens to you and don't take up much space sometimes you would wish she was a little bit more ""roomy"" but she has some.. you know.. great moves that I quite got to miss when I left her for google chrome.

Firefox: well, I must say, I know a lot of people who really is crazy about firefox, she knows a lot of tricks and is easy to teach stuff, but she's kinda weird, her dresses are wierd, and while you say that she has become fat, I really think that she was fat all along, and yes, she is better at understanding your favorite places than chrome, but chrome is so much better at everything else, AND she is way more pretty, imo.

"c2sin2x","I'm sorry but I don't want to be an Emperor, that's not my business. I don't want to rule or conquer anyone. I should like to help everyone if possible, Jew, gentile, black man, white. We all want to help one another, human beings are like that. We all want to live by each other's happiness, not by each other's misery. We don't want to hate and despise one another. In this world there is room for everyone and the earth is rich and can provide for everyone.

The way of life can be free and beautiful. But we have lost the way.

Greed has poisoned men's souls, has barricaded the world with hate;
has goose-stepped us into misery and bloodshed.

We have developed speed but we have shut ourselves in:
machinery that gives abundance has left us in want.
Our knowledge has made us cynical,
our cleverness hard and unkind.
We think too much and feel too little:
More than machinery we need humanity;
More than cleverness we need kindness and gentleness.

Without these qualities, life will be violent and all will be lost.

The aeroplane and the radio have brought us closer together. The very nature of these inventions cries out for the goodness in men, cries out for universal brotherhood for the unity of us all. Even now my voice is reaching millions throughout the world, millions of despairing men, women and little children, victims of a system that makes men torture and imprison innocent people. To those who can hear me I say ""Do not despair"".

The misery that is now upon us is but the passing of greed, the bitterness of men who fear the way of human progress: the hate of men will pass and dictators die and the power they took from the people, will return to the people and so long as men die [now] liberty will never perish. . .

Soldiers: don't give yourselves to brutes, men who despise you and enslave you, who regiment your lives, tell you what to do, what to think and what to feel, who drill you, diet you, treat you as cattle, as cannon fodder.

Don't give yourselves to these unnatural men, machine men, with machine minds and machine hearts. You are not machines. You are not cattle. You are men. You have the love of humanity in your hearts. You don't hate, only the unloved hate. Only the unloved and the unnatural. Soldiers: don't fight for slavery, fight for liberty.

In the seventeenth chapter of Saint Luke it is written:
""The kingdom of God is within man""
Not one man, nor a group of men, but in all men; in you, the people.

You the people have the power, the power to create machines, the power to create happiness. You the people have the power to make life free and beautiful, to make this life a wonderful adventure. Then in the name of democracy let's use that power, let us all unite. Let us fight for a new world, a decent world that will give men a chance to work, that will give you the future and old age and security. By the promise of these things, brutes have risen to power, but they lie. They do not fulfil their promise, they never will. Dictators free themselves but they enslave the people. Now let us fight to fulfil that promise. Let us fight to free the world, to do away with national barriers, do away with greed, with hate and intolerance. Let us fight for a world of reason, a world where science and progress will lead to all men's happiness.

Soldiers! In the name of democracy, let us all unite!

. . .

Look up! Look up! The clouds are lifting, the sun is breaking through. We are coming out of the darkness into the light. We are coming into a new world. A kind new world where men will rise above their hate and brutality.

The soul of man has been given wings, and at last he is beginning to fly. He is flying into the rainbow, into the light of hope, into the future, that glorious future that belongs to you, to me and to all of us. Look up. Look up.

1) This past New Years Eve, none of my friends were throwing parties and if they were attending one it wasn't with a mutual acquaintance so I didn't get invited. My parents were throwing a party for a few close friends, but I was determined to not stay at home with them, so I got dolled up &amp; dressed with no place to go and hopped in my car. I texted a friend or two to see what they were up to, and my buddy Mark invited me down to a club he was at about 40 minutes away. I get there and it's Mark and his GF, and 3 other couples at a VIP table. Around 11:45, I realized that midnight would get really awkward when I would be surrounded by smooching couples and all I could do is stand there downing another Cranberry-Vodka, so I excused myself and hopped back into the car. I was on the 405N as the clock struck midnight, poetically passing El Toro, and listening to ""Starlight"" by Slash and Myles Kennedy. Silver Lining: no one is on the freeway at midnight on New Years Eve, and it only took me 25 minutes to speed home.
2) I bought two tickets to see Ray LaMontagne at The Greek, couldn't find anyone to come with, so I dragged along an old FwB that I still enjoy hanging out with as friends. We got super hammered, and though I could remember really grooving during the show, I couldn't remember much of the show itself.

We have gathered together, citizens of this great nation unbound by race, religion, or class, in Liberty Square to address serious concerns for our immediate future and the future of our young and unborn generations. The way of life can be free and beautiful. But we have lost the way.
  
Global media and the internet have given us the potential for universal brotherhood and the unity of us all. Words such as these are capable of reaching billions of people throughout the world, billions of despairing men, women, and little children, victims of a system that has enslaved and imprisoned innocent people. To those who can hear us, we say ‚ÄúDo not despair‚Äù. We are all allies. We are the 99%. We represent the people, and support a government of the people, by the people, and most importantly, for the people.
  
Our system must protect human rights, and upon corruption of that system, it is up to the individuals to secure their own rights, and those of their neighbors.  A democratic government derives its power from the people, but corporations have sought to extract wealth and resources from the people and the Earth. No true democracy can be obtained when economics dictates and influences politics. We come to you at a time when corporations, whose interest is profit over people, self-interest over justice, and oppression over equality, run our governments. Assembled under the First Amendment since September 17th and without violence, we will remain here to address these issues:
  
A government of the people, by the people, for the people; a transparent democracy as foreseen by our founding fathers. The time for subversive political tactics is over, and it is time to start using a logical approach to reach solutions and compromises. This can only be done with an open forum in which all major viewpoints can be heard and debated freely. Stop interfering with the First Amendment rights which protect the freedoms of religion or belief, speech, and the press, as well as the rights for us to assemble here and petition the government. We believe this should include access to the internet as a basic human right for freedom of expression and education. Many of our personal freedoms were sacrificed in the name of liberty under the Patriot Act. We demand a review of the benefits and consequences associated with this act as the ten year anniversary of its signing nears. 
  
Corporations have continuously sought to strip employees of the right to negotiate for better pay and safer working conditions. The courts grant corporations many of the same rights as people, yet no one is held accountable for their wrongdoings. Corporations have multimillion dollar legal teams and resources to protect their interests, as well as a financial influence on government that corrupts and controls politicians. Manufacturers have deliberately declined to recall faulty products endangering lives in pursuit of profit. Economic policies have been continued, despite showing catastrophic failures. We demand these practices be investigated, and guidelines are set to ensure that the rights of people supersede those of a corporation. Don‚Äôt let the top 1% controlling corporations regulate the government of the people; it is the government that regulates the corporation.
  
Reform the banking and investment system responsible for record foreclosures and the collapse of many American families. Banks should represent a source of economic stability and growth, but have begun operating under poor business models, and have significantly contributed to the current financial crisis. We call for an investigative committee to thoroughly examine the banking system, and propose guidelines to separate investment banking from commercial banking. 
  
Finally, we must have serious and immediate plans for control of government spending, and be sure that our priorities are correct as a nation. Domestic budget cuts affecting public servants and teachers, as well as reduced funding for scientific research and development and agencies such as the EPA and NASA, are hugely disproportionate to the military spending associated with controversial and costly occupations of foreign territories. It is time to focus on rebuilding our domestic infrastructure and establish more diplomatic and democratic approaches to foreign policy.

  Join us in voicing our opposition to the select few that have left our government, economy, and society compromised. We citizens demand that the US government immediately take action to present a democratic forum for the discussion of these topics, and address the changes that are needed to help America find our way. Our way to a free and beautiful life.

"c2nu2lw","Sorry for the late reply...

&gt;How can it be personal when there isn't a name associated with your god or goddess? I've seen a lot of Wiccans who take the names of Greek, or Norse, or whatever pantheon's gods and use them, but aren't those just placeholders?

It IS personal- it's personal to the practitioner. Some simply believe in higher beings, but don't associate myth to them. So, it's easy for them to form a connection with a nameless God/dess. My Gods aren't placeholders- they have myth and story behind them. They have flaws,  and I do honor them in some of the traditional ways. Other ways that I honor them I have found through their myth or UPG. 

&gt; And if you DON'T believe that your god or goddess has a real tangible effect on the world, what's the point of worship? You believe in witchcraft, which is your own effect on the world, but if your deity can't bend reality to their will, what's the point?

I believe that my Gods have the ability to effect their change on the world, but I also believe that we have free will, as well. 

&gt;why not try to worship those gods in the way they were worshiped before, being that if they were truly creatures that existed they would prefer worship in the way they were used to? 

There are other Pagan traditions that do just that- these are reconstructionists. Most popular seem to be Celtic or Hellenic recon traditions.

&gt;And it is that last thing I do have a bit of criticism for Wicca about. From what I've seen it's very much what you want it to be. You said there are no set rules, so how can your goddess and god have flaws and be dear to you? It honestly seems to me they are intentionally featureless, like a worn statue that could be anything. Catholic in the true definition of the word.

This isn't true at all. Just because there is no set dogma doesn't mean that the gods are featureless and bland. Because there is no set dogma, no rules we HAVE to follow (besides the things I mentioned in my previous post), we are able to make personal connection to ANY of the Gods. For example:

* Aphrodite, born of the ocean, beautiful, but also spiteful
* Hera, wife to Zeus, but jealous of Zeus' other lovers
* Lugh, the Celtic jack-of-all-trades and warrior
* Hades, who loved a woman so much he kidnapped her and tricked her into a situation where she is stuck with him for part of the year
* Demeter a mother who loved her daughter so much that when she disappeared, she abandoned all of her responsibilities to single-mindedly locate her daughter

There are many different pantheons and many different god/desses that those in eclectic Wicca might choose to try to connect with, and many times we find that a god/dess will choose to work with you. My personal practice (which is different from the practice I have with my coven), includes making offerrings to my patron Goddess, and devotional prayers and communion with Her. Now, that might not be for everyone. If Brighid was my patron god/dess, I might honor Her through song and fire. If Flora was my patron god/dess, I might honor Her through a garden in Her name. Just becuase there isn't one 'right' way to worship, doesn't mean that we don't make the gods a part of our daily life, and accept them as who they are. 

&gt;Part of the reason I could not find a religion that I felt represented truth is because they all seemed, for lack of a better word, bland. Without the ecstasies and torments, without the deep emotions, it just seems, quite frankly, boring.

When you mention ecstasies and torments, I'm not sure if you are talking about the myth and personality of the god/dess, or the feelings of the practioner. Life is hard enough, bringing it's torments and ecstasies. I won't lie, when Pagans of any flavor get together and party, there's usually a lot of happy, and not a whole lot of sad. But, at Samhain, when we honor the dead, there can be a lot of tears, as well. So much so, that our coven closes this sabbat to even our congregational group, as it's usually extremely personal and we are hot messes by the end of circle. Though we are happy that our loved ones have moved on, we still grieve and miss them- and we are grateful for the support of our sisters and the loving arms of the gods. At Beltane, we may rejoice in the love and frivolity of the spring, but on the opposite side of the wheel, we honor and sometimes still mourn those who have left us. So we too, have our torments.

Is ritual bland? Sometimes. Is ritual transformative and amazing? Sometimes. 

&gt;Also excuse if any of this doesn't make a lot of sense, a lot of it is borne from that same deep frustration. It's mostly emotional, and not so much intellectual and so it suffers for that. I truly am not trying to ask ignorant or belligerent questions. I appreciate the answers you've given. Most of this are rantings of an atheist that is one mostly out of deep frustration in expecting so much more and not finding it.

I'm enjoying this dialogue. I love talking about this and answering these sorts of questions, as it makes me think about, realize and analyze my own feelings and experiences.

Even now my voice is reaching millions throughout the world, millions of despairing men, women and little children, victims of a system that makes men torture and imprison innocent people. To those who can hear me I say ""Do not despair"".

The misery that is now upon us is but the passing of greed, the bitterness of men who fear the way of human progress: the hate of men will pass and dictators die and the power they took from the people, will return to the people and so long as men die [now] liberty will never perish. . .

Soldiers: don't give yourselves to brutes, men who despise you and enslave you, who regiment your lives, tell you what to do, what to think and what to feel, who drill you, diet you, treat you as cattle, as cannon fodder.

Don't give yourselves to these unnatural men, machine men, with machine minds and machine hearts. You are not machines. You are not cattle. You are men. You have the love of humanity in your hearts. You don't hate, only the unloved hate. Only the unloved and the unnatural. Soldiers: don't fight for slavery, fight for liberty.

In the seventeenth chapter of Saint Luke it is written:
""The kingdom of God is within man""
Not one man, nor a group of men, but in all men; in you, the people.

You the people have the power, the power to create machines, the power to create happiness. You the people have the power to make life free and beautiful, to make this life a wonderful adventure. Then in the name of democracy let's use that power, let us all unite. Let us fight for a new world, a decent world that will give men a chance to work, that will give you the future and old age and security. By the promise of these things, brutes have risen to power, but they lie. They do not fulfil their promise, they never will. Dictators free themselves but they enslave the people. Now let us fight to fulfil that promise. Let us fight to free the world, to do away with national barriers, do away with greed, with hate and intolerance. Let us fight for a world of reason, a world where science and progress will lead to all men's happiness.

Soldiers! In the name of democracy, let us all unite!



. . .

Look up! Look up! The clouds are lifting, the sun is breaking through. We are coming out of the darkness into the light. We are coming into a new world. A kind new world where men will rise above their hate and brutality.

The soul of man has been given wings, and at last he is beginning to fly. He is flying into the rainbow, into the light of hope, into the future, that glorious future that belongs to you, to me and to all of us. Look up. Look up.

On top of Ran from Kurosawa, you can generally pick up any of his other samurai flicks for a good watch.  Suggestions for those would be: Sanjuro, Yojimbo, Hidden Fortress, Seven Samurai, etc, etc.

Then, you could always watch House (Hausu).  Goofy old Japanese horror movie.  Totally worth it.

Um, in more recent years, if you're into goofy shit, there's always anything from the Sushi Typhoon guys.  Stupid fun/violence/gore: Tokyo Gore Police, Robo Geisha, Machine Girl, Yakuza Weapon, Deadball (speaking of Deadball, the first movie that came out, Battlefield Baseball, also registers under stupid but worth the watch classic B-movies), and anything else directed by that little group.

He created javascript, still not relevant to anything in this discussion.

&gt;this exact same problem faces desktop apps, was solved, and can be trivially equivalently solved in a full-browser experience

No it's not. Desktop applications are consistent. Web apps are not. There are some differences between operating systems because the operating systems are developd under different ideas. but within the operating system all desktop applicatons follow the same interface rules.

&gt;this is how the internet already works, and the conventions likely would not change. the designer of the website determines link actions and always has, same as desktop developers determine button actions (which can also spawn tabs, change in-window content, or spawn new windows)

Desktop applications use proper placement of buttons and visual cues t tell user's how a button will behave.. web applications don't do this. The closest thing webapps have is if youre a bit tech savvy and you look in the bottom corner of your web browser you can usually make an good guess of what might happen if you click a link.

&gt;the same was said of the desktop environment for a very long time (and often still is). this is why OSes have design guidlines (which are still only rarely followed). wild wests take time to condense to something beautiful, but last I checked the wild west is now California.

With the exception of web browsers and desktop apps targeted to ""web users"" (which probably has something to do with how inconsistent the web is) all desktop applications follow the same rules.. I can open any desktop word processor, and even if I've never used it before, or even heard of it..... I know how to perform every single basic function... No webapp can say the same. Webapps require a long period of trial and error before you can figure out where things are... 

For example... on reddit.com I click preferences on the top right hand of the page to change my account settings and page view settings. On google.com there is no preferences button.. but if I click my username and then click account settings I can find my account settings. however I can't find any of my preferences here, I have to use the gear icon to change my google.com search preferences..... youtube.com has a similiar system however there is no gear icon.. instead the site preferences are next to my acocunt preferences.......... Every single website is different, and it's never going to be the same.

"c27zzcc","&gt; thats got nothing to do with what I'm talking about. I'm talking about how google is trying to keep everything focused on the world wide web when the world wide web is just one thing that exists within the internet. You've just linked to an article that is someone going on about how great the web /how great they want to make it be. I was making the point that you can utilize the power of the internet without a web browser,

do you even know who Brendan Eich is?

&gt; Dropbox (and similiar) lets you access your files through a web interface as an extra feature. the purpose of this kind of service is so you can have a working copy of your files everywhere on all devices... to me it doesn't seem like you've even used this kind of service before

I interned there for two summers

&gt;The usability issues I'm referring to is stuff like not having hot keys, or on website that do the hotkeys interfere with the web browser or they are incosistent across other websites. For example lets say you want to quickly save a file in a web based word processor... What key combo do you use? The industry standard quick save hotkey is ctrl+s. But wouldn't that cause the browser to save the webpage? Did the developer of the webapp include hotkey support? If so did he make it override the browser's hotkeys...? or will it ignore this possibility and the browser and the webapp perform their ctrl+s function...... So pretty much the ctrl+s key in web based word processing is the hotkey for WHO KNOWS!

this exact same problem faces desktop apps, was solved, and can be trivially equivalently solved in a full-browser experience

&gt;Also, wen I click something that appears to be a link in a web browser... does it open a new page, does it open in a new tab? a new window? is the link not really a link and it's actually just going to reveal hidden elements within the page?... When I click submit or send am I going to leave the webpage that I am on?.. or is it just going to perform an action without the webapge using javascript and I remain on the page.

this is how the internet already works, and the conventions likely would not change. the designer of the website determines link actions and always has, same as desktop developers determine button actions (which can also spawn tabs, change in-window content, or spawn new windows)

&gt;Webapps simply just don't follow accepted interface rules. and when a webapp does have a good interface it's still not consistent with any other webapp. It's the fucking wild wild west.. and none of these problems are going to be addressed any time soon (or ever most likely.. as it is likely not possible.. due to how html/css/javascript are deisgned, how the webaps are coded, and the mindsets of ""web"" developers.)

"c271mnv","For me, Mathematicians are akin to artists in a very important way: we both primarily concern ourselves with pattern. For a mathematician, pattern that is grotesque is not of particular interest in studying, i.e. the collection of rocks on a gravel road. But the beauty of the the atoms in a crystal, or of the Fibonacci sequence draws us and demands study.  Pattern seeps across all fields of mathematics and unifies them:geometry, algebra, calculus, topology. All of these systems were created due to their observed constancy and consistency. If math were chaotic it would be uninteresting; It is math's order and truth that make it beautiful. 

But Math is not art for art has free rein where math is controlled by the axioms we apply. But this structure and frame within which we create meaningful, practical and beautiful patterns make it a more skilled and satisfying subject.

I'm sorry but I don't want to be an Emperor, that's not my business. I don't want to rule or conquer anyone. I should like to help everyone if possible, Jew, gentile, black man, white. We all want to help one another, human beings are like that. We all want to live by each other's happiness, not by each other's misery. We don't want to hate and despise one another. In this world there is room for everyone and the earth is rich and can provide for everyone. The way of life can be free and beautiful. But we have lost the way. Greed has poisoned men's souls, has barricaded the world with hate, has goose-stepped us into misery and bloodshed. We have developed speed but we have shut ourselves in. Machinery that gives abundance has left us in want. Our knowledge has made us cynical, our cleverness hard and unkind. We think too much and feel too little. More than machinery we need humanity. More than cleverness we need kindness and gentleness. Without these qualities, life will be violent and all will be lost. 

The aeroplane and the radio have brought us closer together. The very nature of these inventions cries out for the goodness in men, cries out for universal brotherhood for the unity of us all. Even now my voice is reaching millions throughout the world, millions of despairing men, women and little children, victims of a system that makes men torture and imprison innocent people. To those who can hear me I say: do not despair. The misery that is now upon us is but the passing of greed, the bitterness of men who fear the way of human progress. The hate of men will pass and dictators die and the power they took from the people will return to the people. And so long as men die, liberty will never perish. 

Soldiers: don't give yourselves to brutes, men who despise you and enslave you, who regiment your lives, tell you what to do, what to think and what to feel. Who drill you, diet you, treat you as cattle, use you as cannon fodder. Don't give yourselves to these unnatural men: machine men, with machine minds and machine hearts. You are not machines. You are not cattle. You are men! You have the love of humanity in your hearts. You don't hate, only the unloved hate. Only the unloved and the unnatural. 

Soldiers: don't fight for slavery, fight for liberty. In the seventeenth chapter of Saint Luke it is written: ""The kingdom of God is within man"" Not one man, nor a group of men, but in all men. In you, the people. You the people have the power, the power to create machines, the power to create happiness. You the people have the power to make life free and beautiful, to make this life a wonderful adventure. Then in the name of democracy let us use that power, let us all unite! Let us fight for a new world, a decent world that will give men a chance to work, that will give you the future and old age and security. By the promise of these things, brutes have risen to power, but they lie. They do not fulfill their promise, they never will. Dictators free themselves but they enslave the people. Now let us fight to fulfill that promise. Let us fight to free the world, to do away with national barriers, do away with greed, with hate and intolerance. Let us fight for a world of reason, a world where science and progress will lead to all men's happiness.

The idea of showing yourself so explicitly reflects badly upon that person's personality for me. 7 miles of cleavage and an exposed minge is all fine and dandy, but it just isn't attractive to me at all and I think women who dress as such will only repulse the men worth meeting and instead attract the high testosterone wife beaters and thugs.

Everything Will Not Be Fine


""Where are you going?, Where have you been?"" by Joyce Carol Oates, is a short story about the abduction of a young girl in Tuscon, Arizona (1966). Connie is a beautiful but somewhat irresponsible fifteen-year-old girl who chafes with her mother, herself once a beauty, and with her dutiful, ""steady"", and homely older sister. Connie is the the youngest girl in a seemingly nuclear family.  The professional lives of the parents are unaddressed, yet Connie is privileged to live in a safe middle class community. The father of the family is referenced scarcely; the mother's role is antagonistic in that Connie lives her life rebelliously. This scene realizes that the mother of this family is the same character that appears in ""Hills Like White Elephants"" by Earnest Hemingway, referenced as Jig (1927). Jig is the woman that comes home to an abandoned house in the period after ""Where are you Going?, Where have you Been?"" takes place. The mother is psychologically unstable after this trauma and begins to gush long held secrets to her remaining daughter. June is twenty-four years old and has been dependent on her family for shelter and finance her entire life. She is employed at the local High School, and has an active peer group. Jig considers this a conservative success of her maternity.

    ""Don't you worry, Honey,"" said the old bald man, ""I will drive into town and ask around. Connie is only a little girl, she wouldn't even know where to run off to."" 

    ""I'm sure you're right, I'm sure everything will be fine"" the worried mother said under her breath. ""Don't be too long, when I am left alone I think the worst.""
    
    Soon the old man crawled down the long gravel drive and was gone. The woman lost track of time sitting in her chair and staring out the window. The front door quietly opened.

    ""Momma? Where are you Momma?"" cried June
   
    ""Connie?"" yelled the woman excitedly.

    ""No, Momma. I can't find her."" said June, ""One of the neighbors down the road saw her drive off with two boys this afternoon, but he couldn't tell me which boys. I know all of the boys at the high school; and I don't know a single one who doesn't have eyes for our Connie.""

    The woman was lost in thought. Where had she gone wrong? How could have this been avoided? ""Where did I go wrong, Baby?"" ""Wasn't I a good mother to you, June?""

    ""The best, Momma! I love you and daddy! I love this house and I never want to leave."" asserted June ""I know how hard it must be to raise two girls, but I've never once seen you cry or yell around us.""

    ""I'm far from perfect, Dear"" said the woman slowly. ""I've made my share of mistakes, the worst of which long before you were even born."" There was a long silence in the room. The woman held her eyes shut, and June stared at her mother.

    The woman opened her eyes. ""I have a confession. Please don't hate me for this, Baby""

    ""Momma?"" whispered June.

    ""I'm not your Momma!"" snapped the woman. ""I raised you alright, but I adopted you when you were only three years old. I'm not even married to your daddy.""

    June was stunned and speechless.

    ""I picked you two girls up from the local orphanage. It was a big decision to have children. I have been infertile since I was seventeen years old. I was sterilized in a dirty Spanish hospital.""

    ""Oh my god, Momma! How did that happen? Why are you telling me this?""
    
    ""I feel like I'm going to burst!"" she blurted ""I can't keep these secrets any more. You are an adult and you have the right to know.""

    June sank into the firm embrace of the couch and listened.
   
    The woman began, ""I ran away from home in 1926. My daddy was working long shifts in the coal mine and I couldn't get along with my momma. She was always picking on me for dressing up for boys. My sisters were homebodies and would do all the cooking and cleaning, there was never anything for me to do in the house! One day, I cussed her out and my momma slapped me across the face. I packed up what little I had and hitch-hiked to the train station.""

    ""Where were you going?"" June pondered aloud.

    ""I hadn't been anywhere outside of Tuscon. I knew about Los Angles and New York, but the train fare was more than I could afford. I got a job at the station diner and worked there for a few weeks, living in the train yard. I hardly remember that time. Before I had saved up enough for a ticket anywhere, I met a man. He was passing through the station on his way to New York. He told me he was going to sail away at the end of the month, and he had a full cabin to himself. I believed every word that he told me, I was only sixteen. He treated me so well that I forgot about my troubled family when I was with him. He had more money than I had ever seen. I was his and he took care of me.""

    ""Is that man my Daddy?"" Questioned June.
    
    ""Ha!"" laughed the woman ""Your 'Daddy' is just an old man. He was a friend of my father. He helped support my family after the mine collapsed and trapped all of those men. He hardly ever thinks about sex, he leaves me alone most of the time.""
    
    ""Oh...""
    
    ""The man was the son of a radio entrepreneur,"" the woman continued; ""He was going to the BBC in London on business, and he was gong to enjoy a few months of vacation in Europe. That may be the only truth that he ever told me. I don't know his real name! He told me that 'No matter who you were with last night today you're with A. Friend, and dont you forget it.' (Oates 295) He introduced himself as my American Friend, which I thought was funny at the time. He was so damn charming! I was so excited, I will never forget his words. 'Put your hand on your heart, honey. Feel that? That feels solid too but we know better, be nice to me, be sweet and pretty and give in.' (Oates 300) It was too easy to give in to his will.""

    June stared attentively.
    
    ""We sailed into Liverpool on the RMS Mauretania. It was the fastest transatlantic ship at the time! [In 1928 RMS Mauretania was modernized with new interior design and in the next year her speed record was broken by a German liner, the Bremen, with a speed of 28 knots.] It was a peaceful trip. We slept in separate beds and he was a perfect gentleman. I wanted the voyage to last forever. I thought that I was finally independent of my family and that all of my worries were behind me. We arrived in England far too soon for my liking and we were checked into a London hotel by the end of the week. It was so romantic! He had ordered champagne for the room and we had a magical night together.""

    ""That sounds like a dream"" cooed June.
   
    ""It was a dream, I wanted the whole world."" said the woman lazily. ""I was living my dream, and he was dreaming separately. He started to call me 'Jig', which I thought was just a silly pet name. I now know that he never respected me. To him, I was just an object to love or a tool. He was having a 'fine time' and I was only an accessory. We can't have the whole world. It isn't ours, and once they take it away, you never get it back. (Hemingway 168) Dreams only make us feel pain.""

    ""That's awful, Momma""
   
    ""It wasn't all bad. We did do a lot of shopping! After his work was done we had no responsibility at all. He paid for everything as we wandered through London, Paris, and Barcelona. We would stop into pubs and we would drink anything that I ordered. We shared many hotel beds, I can hardly remember much of that time."" The woman paused. ""We conceived a child one of those nights that I don't recall. I didn't realize for weeks; and then one day I knew.""

We all want to live by each other's happiness, not by each other's misery. We don't want to hate and despise one another. In this world there is room for everyone and the earth is rich and can provide for everyone.

The way of life can be free and beautiful.

But we have lost the way.

Greed has poisoned men's souls - has barricaded the world with hate; has goose-stepped us into misery and bloodshed.

We have developed speed but we have shut ourselves in: machinery that gives abundance has left us in want. Our knowledge has made us cynical, our cleverness hard and unkind. We think too much and feel too little: More than machinery we need humanity; More than cleverness we need kindness and gentleness. Without these qualities, life will be violent and all will be lost.

The aeroplane and the radio have brought us closer together. The very nature of these inventions cries out for the goodness in men, cries out for universal brotherhood for the unity of us all. Even now my voice is reaching millions throughout the world, millions of despairing men, women and little children, victims of a system that makes men torture and imprison innocent people. To those who can hear me I say ""Do not despair"".

The misery that is now upon us is but the passing of greed, the bitterness of men who fear the way of human progress: the hate of men will pass and dictators die and the power they took from the people, will return to the people and so long as men die [now] liberty will never perish...

Soldiers - don't give yourselves to brutes, men who despise you and enslave you - who regiment your lives, tell you what to do, what to think and what to feel, who drill you, diet you, treat you as cattle, as cannon fodder.

Don't give yourselves to these unnatural men, machine men, with machine minds and machine hearts. You are not machines. You are not cattle. You are men. You have the love of humanity in your hearts. You don't hate - only the unloved hate. Only the unloved and the unnatural. Soldiers - don't fight for slavery, fight for liberty.

In the seventeenth chapter of Saint Luke it is written "" the kingdom of God is within man "" - not one man, nor a group of men - but in all men - in you, the people.

You the people have the power, the power to create machines, the power to create happiness. You the people have the power to make life free and beautiful, to make this life a wonderful adventure. Then in the name of democracy let's use that power - let us all unite. Let us fight for a new world, a decent world that will give men a chance to work, that will give you the future and old age and security. By the promise of these things, brutes have risen to power, but they lie. They do not fulfil their promise, they never will. Dictators free themselves but they enslave the people. Now let us fight to fulfil that promise. Let us fight to free the world, to do away with national barriers, do away with greed, with hate and intolerance. Let us fight for a world of reason, a world where science and progress will lead to all men's happiness.

Soldiers - in the name of democracy, let us all unite!

I mean, I always loved her badassness, but undermining Walterntae to (try to) cross over again alone to a world that sees her as hostile in order to try to save everyone - she is worthy of more than just a commendation. Speaking of which, for a minute there I thought they were going to build on Lincoln's previous declaration of love. But then again, Olivia was so busy giving birth, I wonder if she really heard him. But she *did* say that Linc was the only person she trusts - poor Charlie, he gets no love, lol.  

I think it was deliciously beautiful, story wise, to end this episode with Bolivia in the solitary confinement cell. My first reaction was ""She doesn't have a Broyles to get her out"", but then my next thought was ""Lincoln will get her out"". I can't wait to see that happen. I actually really, really hope that he and Charlie get her and come over to our world to start off the next season. I *think* they wanted to wrap up this story line in this season, though. Who knows? Either way, I eagerly anticipate.  

Also beautiful was the stained glass windows in the hospital chapel. IMO that's the best use of the ""universe colours"" thus far. It was so poetic to see Walter wrestle with the weight of his sins against both worlds while their representative colours were cast so softly upon his face. Just beautiful imagery in more ways than one.  

Not beautiful, but notable, is seeing Peter unconscious at the end of this episode (we'll see if it lasts any longer) in a sort of bookendish parallel or reversal to Olivia being unconscious at the beginning of season two.  

I guess I was wrong before when I thought that Walternate might not be  completely aware of the Machines function :P I'd completely missed/forgotten he'd told Olivia that it would destroy the Bluniverse. I did find it interesting that he and Brandon expect that its use would also directly heal our world too, though. It seems they know it has the potential to create and/or destroy.    

Peter Jr is named Henry. *Aww* (More Cabbie Henry, please.) Since Baby Henry is only 50% Peter, I wonder if that will have any effect on the machine, what it will do, etc?

"c1pwng3","I am an American.

That said, I like to think that I'm more world-wise than your typical American.  I made it a point to pick up as much of the local language as I could when visiting European countries, and recognized that it was my failure if I could not communicate with someone due to a language barrier when visiting their country.

In Germanic countries, Benelux, Greece, and Portugal, I found that a lot of people would readily realize I suck at their language and they would suggest English.  Cool deal.  I know French quite a bit better than the other languages mentioned (though I'm by no means French), so I didn't have as much of a problem in France.

That said, one day I went out around Paris with a very beautiful but extremely stupid American girl.  She wanted a turkey sandwich for lunch, and as I waited to order several people back (it was a group outing), she asked in straight English for a turkey sandwich.  The French woman at the counter didn't understand her, or else chose not to.  So the American girl starts asking in louder and louder, slower and slower English ""TUR-KEY SAND-WICH?  Don't you understand ENGLISH?!""

Like I said, idiotic American girl.

Having told that story, my elementary-school French ticked off several French people later on in my time in Paris, and they started yelling at me, I was told by others who understood better than I that they were angry I didn't have as good of a command of the language as I could have.

I figure that there are sour apples in every lot, but what do you think of the common stereotype of the French that they are very ""snooty"" about the language?  Is it broadly accurate or inaccurate?  Are you (uptight about it, or laid back about it)?  It seems that far fewer French people learn English than, say, Germans or Dutch or Swedes learn English.

"c1n89we","I'm really not trying to be a dick here, but I was in a rush and wanted to post something so that I could find it later. The best thing I could think of was a link to Biblical Scripture that shows why the Christians who read this ought to agree with your sentiment that ""we are humans, not muslims, not jews, not black, not white, we are just like you, we are you"".

It's a sentiment that's easy to lose. How often I wish that I could have empathy and a full relationship with another person! But then I recoil at the slightest doubtor the merest miscommunication; any sign of malice or misdeed or challenge or competition and I forget myself and cast stones at my enemy.

A lot of what you said is good and important and beautiful. But a lot of it is the result of the same kind of incomplete, cracked lens that afflict the rest of us. The Christians call this sin and place it as the source of our inconceivable cruelty, our insecurities, our impiety, and our loss.

So I ask you: what ought to carry forward your banner of love of humanity? Surely it requires something, we joust pettily among ourselves even in this inconsequential argument! Do you suppose, as our neo-atheist leaders, that science will carry us forward? It might... but only by elevating science to a religion which will have all the same problems as our current religions that had allowed science to prosper in the first place...

The Christians submit that the Messiah came as a common enemy for us to stand against together and (in His humility) slaughter. A proper Christian mournfully acknowledges that s/he has murdered his/her very own saviour. But then this saviour rises in glory, and we are invited to join together in worship of our victim who has become our Groom as a Holy Bride called the Church. The Christian supposes that you are so close to correct in what you are asking for, but that you are so fallen for rejecting the answer. S/He doesn't say that you are sent to Hell because God rejects your decision. Rather, you go yourself because you reject God's offer...

... I feel the very same pain that you do. I feel the very same coldness from this world. I feel the very same disconnected attrition. That is what I have made the world - what we have made the world - in our sinfulness. That's why I refuse to worship the world and the humanity who have destroyed it. You're right to feed the hungry, house the poor, to show care for the disadvantaged... these are good things... but the best way that I know how to show love for humanity is to share the Good News that I've shared with you. The Good News that I doubt more often than I accept, that I transgress more thoroughly than I follow. That doesn't make the Good News bleak, rather it confirms my need for it.

That said, the camping seems almost non existent in Peru and Bolivia, but much more prevalent in Argentina and Chile.

Soldiers! Don't give yourselves to brutes - men who despise you and enslave you - who regiment your lives - tell you what to do - what to think and what to feel! Who drill you - diet you - treat you like cattle, use you as cannon fodder. Don't give yourselves to these unnatural men - machine men with machine minds and machine hearts! You are not machines! You are not cattle! You are men! You have the love of humanity in your hearts. You don't hate, only the unloved hate - the unloved and the unnatural!

You, the people, have the power - the power to create machines. The power to create happiness! You, the people, have the power to make this life free and beautiful - to make this life a wonderful adventure. Then in the name of democracy - let us use that power - let us all unite. Let us fight for a new world - a decent world that will give men a chance to work - that will give youth a future and old age a security.  
  
By the promise of these things, brutes have risen to power. But they lie! They do not fulfil that promise. They never will! Dictators free themselves but they enslave the people. Now let us fight to fulfil that promise! Let us fight to free the world - to do away with national barriers - to do away with greed, with hate and intolerance. Let us fight for a world of reason - a world where science and progress will lead to all men's happiness. Soldiers, in the name of democracy, let us unite!

"c1kr0nm","&gt;The fact that Schoenberg's music is clearly situated within in the context of western classical music does provide a surrounding context of familiar conventions. 

I wasn't really talking about historical conventions; I mean that the only fixed point is the tone row.  There is nothing else with which to center the music for interpretation in the listener.  The tone row is a series of pitches at specific intervals, making it (and its inversions, transformations, etc) quite difficult to hear within a piece, even for a trained ear; it takes no advantage of (and indeed rejects) the basic pitch relationships that the brain easily understands. Melody and harmony provide the listener with a balance between intuition and surprise, and I feel comfortable asserting that there are neurological reasons for this.

I'm not discounting the value of the music at all.  I think it's fascinating and beautiful.  But it *is* uniquely difficult.  My main point is that the difficulty is not simply a matter of getting used to more dissonance- Look how well Stravinsky, Prokofiev, Shostakovich, DeBussy have all been welcomed into the Repertoire: such wonderful dissonances have become new consonances! Look at Jazz and its harmonic innovations!  We *have* grown in our acceptance of harmonic diversity over the last 100 years- but it has *still* been tonal harmony.

Orbital's track Halcyon + On + On.  Depending on your age and gender, you may remember it from the beginning of the film Hackers or the end of the film Mean Girls.  (Both are kind of questionable, but fun.)

So it starts off by cycling through some pads.  The first chord is played on a string-like pad on the right speaker, and a lush choir-like pad on the left one.  The second chord is played on a centered synth-like pad.  And they just alternate for a while, overlaid with a bit of lazy piano noodling to maintain the listener's interest, and a lush female vocal to really give the whole piece a beautiful, dreamy feel.  Then a synth bass, guitar and TR-909 join in and it really gets going, but you get the point.

You bring up a good point, but I'd like to hear your thoughts on Laura Mulvey's theory of the male gaze (from her [Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Pleasure_and_Narrative_Cinema#The_gaze_and_the_female_spectator)) in relation to the female nude.  

Mulvey argues that the act of viewing the female body is a form of sexual objectification.  Art has long been a male-dominated medium, and female nudes were typically made by male artists for male viewers.  So in the tradition of art-making and art-viewing, the female body acts as a literal and figurative **object** of man's visual pleasure, created for visual ""consumption"" by the assumed male viewer.  

The relationship between the prototypical male artist and female nude is also seen as a reflection of gender roles, wherein Man is the active partner and Woman is the passive receiver of his actions.  So a female body represented in art is merely the ""bearer of meaning, not [the] maker of meaning.""

**tl;dr** You know how there was a time when women were supposed to be seen and not heard?  Think of a sculpture as a representation of woman as a beautiful, but mute and immobile, object.

"c1d9h29","This is a decent response.

Our minds and bodies are happening. There is an attention gate which directs parts of our stream of experience into awareness. The attention gate scans for patterns at different levels, first of raw experience and then further and further into the abstractions and conceptualizations that exist in idea space. When conflicting patterns are observed, the attention gate shifts awareness to the discontinuity so that as further thought happens we may be aware of the potential resolution. Thought is a thing that happens and when attention turns our awareness towards thought we call that conscious thinking.

In peak states the attention gate allows thought and experience to all flow through awareness together at once, producing a beautiful but overwhelming state. Trying to make conceptual sense of it requires pulling the attention gate back into action and limiting awareness to only those thoughts that occur as echoes of the peak, and therefore out of the peak.

The key here is that while we have multi-track minds, we have single-track awareness. So you may be infinitely aware of awareness, but only on one level at a time. In other words, you can know that you know, and you can know that you know that you know, but only one at a time.

If I remember correctly there was a fellow on here who was mugged there. People get mugged everywhere, but here you would always FEEL like you were about to get mugged. Avoid. 

Navy Yard: Super post apocalyptic, no subway access. Ruins of navy buildings and an active movie studio. 

Dumbo: Brooklyn's SOHO. Really beautiful cast iron loft buildings (90% of which are owned by David Walentis who bought them for  song in the 90's) loads of galleries, bars, etc. Grimaldis pizza, and an amazing waterfront park. Ever see that iconic picture of the Brooklyn Bridge peaking out between two buildings? That's dumbo. 1st stop in Brooklyn on the A or F. Be prepared to pay Manhattan prices.

"c19v199","My opinions:
1. I kindof liked The Suburbs. It's a good album, but I didn't get as much out of it as everyone else seemed to.
2. I loved MBDTF. I've never enjoyed a Kanye Album in full before, but MBDTF blew me away.
3. Brothers was okay, it felt too long and repetitive midway through, though.
4. Plastic Beach would have been great if it had just been the first 10 tracks. The album lost a lot of steam after that.
5. I thought This Is Happening was way overrated. I think Sound of Silver is much much better.
6. I can appreciate High Violet for what it is.
7. I think Mumford and Sons are just awful.
8. Teen Dream, truly lovely, dreamy album.
9. I like The Shins and Danger Mouse, so I enjoyed Broken Bells.
10. I really enjoyed Contra, even better than VW's debut (except it didn't have any songs that paralleled M79, which I think is VW's best song).
11. The Age of Adz was weird for me because it didn't sound like Sufjan.
12. Loved The Lady Killer. Such an awesome mix of modern sound and retro soul.
13. Was a bit put-off by his voice at first, but then I realized it actually adds to the beauty of The Wild Hunt.
14. I like Big Boi, and this album had a couple amazing songs, but I was pretty turned off by it overall.
15. Sleigh Bells were my favorite buzz band last year, and they made an awesome (and loud!) debut.
16. I like ""Odessa"" a lot, and that's it.
17. Didn't listen to it.
18. I enjoyed a few songs off Odd Blood, but the overall feel was too...well, odd for me.
19. Halcyon Digest, if you ignore the song ""Sailing"", is a perfect album in my opinion. It's one of those albums that I bought on vinyl just because I want to hold on to it forever.
20. Go is beautiful. I enjoyed it much more than any Sigur Ros album (still like Sigur Ros, though).
21. I love the beat scene, so Cosmogramma was right up my alley.
22. Honestly: meh.
23. I really only enjoyed Ratatat's debut, and every album after that seems to be derivative of it. They're still using that same guitar tone.
24. I find Kid Cudi to be the most boring rapper ever.
25. I liked All Day as much as any other Girl Talk album: a lot.
26. Loved Crystal Castles.
27. Didn't get into Gorilla Manor as much as everyone else seemed to, but there were a few songs I really enjoyed.
28. I don't really ""get"" Broken Social Scene.
29. BWWWWWWOOOOOOOOOOOMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM.
30. I liked The Monitor a lot. Also, I'm from New Jersey, so yeah, awesome.
31. Instrumentally intricate and beautiful, but it didn't really draw me in.
32. I really only enjoy minimalist techno as background music while driving at night.

"c197mv7","So LA neighborhoods are complicated.  There are larger areas then bunches of small neighborhoods in them; I've been in LA 5+ years at this point and I'm still learning of new ones. Also, since LA didn't have zoning when it was being developed, a neighborhood can be great but go two blocks south and it's crap.   Google maps is going to be your best friend as you're searching.

If you want to be in Hollywood proper (Near Hollywood and Highland and the walk of stars/tons of nightlife.  One of the few places in the city near a Metro line, though it's really only useful to get downtown/to the airport via the flyaway bus) stay north of Hollywood Blvd.  Some search terms to throw into Craigslist that will give you good hits: Whitley Heights, Franklin (this is the name of a street that runs along the base of the hills; it's not too long and pretty much anything along it or near it is in a good neighborhood.)  If you want to be up in the hills a little more (which are really awesome and beautiful but a little bit more expensive) try Laurel Canyon, Runyon Canyon, or Hollywood Hills.  If you go to the east of the 101, it's technically still Hollywood but a little more neighborhoody (still a ton of young people.  This is where the UCB theater is as well as a bunch of fun restaurants).  A search for Franklin will give you stuff along here.  Also try ""Beachwood"" or ""Beachwood Canyon.""

Just to the east of Hollywood is Los Feliz (on a map: eastern border is Normandie, West is 5 freeway, South is Sunset, North is the Hills).  I'm a bit biased because that's where I live, but it's awesome.  Very walkable (by LA standards) and a mix of young 20 somethings and hip families. Cute bars, restaurants, independent bookshops, etc.  To the south/east of Los Feliz is Silver Lake (sometimes spelled Silverlake; though the former is correct I'd craigslist search both).  Silver Lake is a little more urban than Los Feliz, but is one of the most desirable places for young people to live in the city.  The heart of the neighborhood is Sunset Junction; there are tons of cool shops and restaurants along Sunset Blvd.  There are also some really nice homes up in the hills around Silver Lake Reservoir.  These two neighborhoods are probably the farthest from Beverly hills of those I'll recommend, but the advantage is that they're right over the hill from Burbank, where several of the main studios are (and were I'd expect you'll likely end up doing some work if you're an actor.)

Another sub-neighborhood of Hollywood is Hancock Park (on the Southern end of Hollywood; southern border is Wilshire, northern is Melrose, western is Wilton, eastern is Fairfax.)  It's a little bit more quiet and family oriented here, but definitely worth looking into.  Search terms: Hancock Park, Larchmont (street of boutique shops/restaurants), The Grove (an outdoor shopping mall).

Anywhere in West Hollywood is probably safe and nice; the neighborhood is a combination of yuppyish young couples and families and gay men.  It's a very open, friendly place, but if you're not completely comfortable with seeing gay culture than you might find yourself uncomfortable here.

Beverly Hills proper is (in my opinion) a little snobby and filled with a lot of stereotypical egotistical, superficial Angelinos.  Also, it's very expensive.  However, just outside of it you have the Pico and Fairfax district and Culver City which are both nice, quiet areas.  If you can get near the downtown culver city area there's some good nightlife, but otherwise I really think of these parts of town as commuter areas because they don't really have a central, walkable part, which I know you East-coasters like!

Alright, well this has turned into the beginnings of a novel.  See what happens when you give me an excuse to avoid work?  Hopefully this gives you a jumping off place in terms of where to start...

 &gt;I'm sorry, but I don't want to be an emperor. That's not my business. I don't want to rule or conquer anyone. I should like to help everyone if possible - Jew, Gentile - black man - white.

&gt;We all want to help one another. Human beings are like that. We want to live by each other's happiness - not by each other's misery. We don't want to hate and despise one another. In this world there's room for everyone and the good earth is rich and can provide for everyone.

&gt;The way of life can be free and beautiful, but we have lost the way. Greed has poisoned men's souls - has barricaded the world with hate - has goose-stepped us into misery and bloodshed. We have developed speed, but we have shut ourselves in. Machinery that gives abundance has left us in want. Our knowledge has made us cynical; our cleverness, hard and unkind. We think too much and feel too little. More than machinery we need humanity. More than cleverness, we need kindness and gentleness. Without these qualities, life will be violent and all will be lost.

&gt;The aeroplane and the radio have brought us closer together. The very nature of these inventions cries out for the goodness in man - cries for universal brotherhood - for the unity of us all. Even now my voice is reaching millions throughout the world - millions of despairing men, women, and little children - victims of a system that makes men torture and imprison innocent people. To those who can hear me, I say: 'Do not despair.' The misery that is now upon us is but the passing of greed - the bitterness of men who fear the way of human progress. The hate of men will pass, and dictators die, and the power they took from the people will return to the people. And so long as men die, liberty will never perish.

&gt;Soldiers! Don't give yourselves to brutes - men who despise you and enslave you - who regiment your lives - tell you what to do - what to think and what to feel! Who drill you - diet you - treat you like cattle, use you as cannon fodder. Don't give yourselves to these unnatural men - machine men with machine minds and machine hearts! You are not machines! You are not cattle! You are men! You have the love of humanity in your hearts. You don't hate, only the unloved hate - the unloved and the unnatural!

&gt;Soldiers! Don't fight for slavery! Fight for liberty! In the seventeenth chapter of St Luke, it is written the kingdom of God is within man not one man nor a group of men, but in all men! In you! You, the people, have the power - the power to create machines. The power to create happiness! You, the people, have the power to make this life free and beautiful - to make this life a wonderful adventure. Then in the name of democracy - let us use that power - let us all unite. Let us fight for a new world - a decent world that will give men a chance to work - that will give youth a future and old age a security.

&gt;By the promise of these things, brutes have risen to power. But they lie! They do not fulfil that promise. They never will! Dictators free themselves but they enslave the people. Now let us fight to fulfil that promise! Let us fight to free the world - to do away with national barriers - to do away with greed, with hate and intolerance. Let us fight for a world of reason - a world where science and progress will lead to all men's happiness. Soldiers, in the name of democracy, let us unite!

&gt;Hannah, can you hear me? Wherever you are, look up Hannah. The clouds are lifting! The sun is breaking through! We are coming out of the darkness into the light. We are coming into a new world - a kindlier world, where men will rise above their hate, their greed and their brutality. Look up, Hannah!

"c17z1g5","Right, but calling it a tragedy is applying a judgement to what is basically an amoral situation.  [Sexual selection](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_selection) traits dominating survival traits is not *bad*.  It just *is*.

&gt; Due to their sometimes greatly exaggerated nature, secondary sexual characteristics can prove to be a hindrance to an animal, thereby lowering its chances of survival. For example, the large antlers of a moose are bulky and heavy and slow the creature's flight from predators; they also can become entangled in low-hanging tree branches and shrubs, and undoubtedly have led to the demise of many individuals. Bright colorations and showy ornamenations, such as those seen in many male birds, in addition to capturing the eyes of females, also attract the attention of predators; when a male peacock spreads its tail, it is beautiful, but very obvious (though this may actually be advantageous to the survival of the male's offspring and the breeding population as a whole; see below). Some of these traits also represent energetically costly investments for the animals that bear them. Because traits held to be due to sexual selection often conflict with the survival fitness of the individual, the question then arises as to why, in nature, in which survival of the fittest is considered the rule of thumb, such apparent liabilities are allowed to persist.

*Why* runaway sexual selection traits happen to species, even though they are a hindrance, is an open question.  There are probably lots of interlocking factors.  But to put a judgement on it saying it's *bad* that species have these attributes isn't the right way to go.

"c17cduh"," not the guy you were asking, but I'm not a christian and I've been to quite a few churches. There are a couple of things that put me right off them.

 a) *pointless repetition.* 

 About %50 of any service is spent reciting the same thing, week in week out. Of course there is worth in tradition, but for generations who have a terrible attention span and are used to being able to fast forward the boring bits, it really really grates.    

 b) *Uncomfortable*

 you spend most of your time swapping between kneeling and standing, and when you finally get to sit its on horrible thin little wooden benches. 

 c) *Ugly*

 Churches are meant to be a reflection of the glorious splendour of creation right?  And some old churches are beautiful, but most modern churches are horrible brick boxes adorned with gaudy gold trinkets and sadomasochistic statues. I wouldn't want to visit a place like that for any reason. 

 d) *Dull.*
 
 It might be because the target audience is old people, or because the general idea of fun at a church is drinking prune juice while doing crochet, but there just seem to be anything particularly interesting happening.  I hear that some churches have rock climbing walls and computer games, but I've never seen one, and even if I did find one, I'd bet it'd be a poorly lit brick box, like most church halls, and therefore deeply uncool.  

  If you made church like a TED talk held at a starbucks, you'd get a lot more young people coming along.  

 
 edit: After speaking with my fianc√©e, who used to sing in church choirs, I guess the general idea we want to get across is that the entire paradigm has to be shifted. A couple of hundred years ago people went to church because they couldn't read, and they needed someone to speak the words of the bible for them. But we can all read now, and we can seek out our own wisdom and our own personal relationships with god. Most young young people have a real problem with a central authority figure, we've gone to shit schools with angry teachers on power trips, we've been lied to by our governments and by the media, everyone in a central position of authority has been untrustworthy. We get our truth in through decentralised collective agreement, we have had to learn how to recognise the lies and the spin and see through to the heart of things. By sticking with the singular narrative espoused from a podium down to the masses, the church has missed the interconnectivity bandwagon entirely. A priest is no closer to god than any member of the congregation, so why does he get to interpret God's will for everyone? Church is meant to be a community right? Its meant to be a collective who want to share in a collective appreciation of existence and teachings. Well currently church doesn't feel like that, it feels like a patriarchal dictatorship, an oligarchy of spin and lies.  No amount of happy clappy faux rock is going to change that, it just puts a sickly sweet face mask over a horrible old tyrant.   

 If you could make it into something enjoyable, beautiful and meaningful, something which engages people and actually cares what people think, rather than just telling them what to think, you'd have a much greater chance of capturing the imagination of the youth.

I hate it when I hear people say that wood boats are the best. There is the saying ""horses for courses"" that I think applies here in a major way. It depends why you want the boat, what you are doing with it, and how much time you have.

I would love a nice wood boat in retirement, but for now my hands are full with the plastic one I have. I would seriously question this guys sanity when he writes:



*Finally, with some of the modern technology that was mentioned earlier, wooden sailboats actually need much less maintenance than their fiberglass brethren. Despite all the technology we have, a fiberglass boat will deteriorate continually with age, and there is little that can be done to prevent it. On the other hand, a wooden boat can last for decades in good safe condition. You need only an annual maintenance check to keep them looking and floating like brand new.*",1290056594,"they are undoubtably sturdy and beautiful, but they require a great deal of time to keep them up, and if they are not kept up they deteriorate very quickly.","sturdy and beautiful","beautiful",NA,FALSE,"undoubtably sturdy and beautiful","sturdy",NA,"undoubtably",0

That said...

&gt;On a couple of visits to Hawai'i I hired a naturalist/ornithologist to take me out looking for birds, and we saw a number of these. (We have them on the mainland, too.)

The only thing I hired was a helicopter to take me around...  Hiring a naturalist to take you around sounds amazing.  I didn't get many options as far as what I would do during this trip, unfortunately.  Having someone pay for it all for me limited things much more than I woulld like.  I got this picture while deciding to walk off on a nice 7-8 mile trek around the city.  Sadly it was sitting right next to a very polluted waterway - there were tons of car batteries and other things in the water, and downstream a little bit it smelled very much like sewage.  A few miles over there were people fishing, and the water looked clean and clear and beautiful - but the area this picture was taken in was just trashed.

"c0y3q7j","&gt;First you say that I missed the point, which point exactly?

The point that the feeling of starting a new, fresh adventure without knowing the actual possibilities and completely free of all worries... just knowing that it's going to be huge and you will have a lot of fun. That was the point. You treated it like it's completely redundant and in any way diminishes your perception of reality... or whatever.

&gt;If real life isn't interesting enough that you find yourself escaping into fiction, then you need to make a change in your life.

Well, tell me how, then instead of just repeating it. I can't believe you.

Our world is absolutely limited. I can't fly, I can't cast magic, I don't have futuristic weapons, I can't go where no man has ever gone before while also going somwhere completely different and then to a different place and then to Mars... and then to another galaxy... and then seeing intelligent lifeforms I have never seen before.

&gt;but for the love of holy fuck would I never trade any of those in for the visceral thrill of travel

Well, I don't enjoy broken bones, exhaustion, diseases, agression, hostility, danger or the stupidity of humans. Also, I don't like walking/flying around for days and weeks and climb mountains to finally see a beautiful waterfall and swim in it while the moon slowly makes his way up. I want that moon and that waterfall now... and I can have it... with video games. I can even have two waterfalls and two moons and 20 beautiful mermaids. Withou fucking up my knees and feet walking there and without training my body for months just so I can survive the trip.

&gt;camaraderie 

Well, I enjoy my friends sitting on my couch, too. I always enjoy them. I don't have to suffer to enjoy life together with them. I don't need to feel pain, I don't have to share danger. I can just enjoy my friends. 

I don't need a physical experience. All I actually need is my brain. 

&gt;I have all the tools I need to shape my day into something fucking awesome

Well, I don't. My mind is absolutely limited by my body. I want to create worlds and fly around this universe discovering its secrets... I can't.

&gt;and I don't need to escape my reality by diving into a fabricated illusion that makes me feel like I'm more than I actually am

Well, I want to be more than I actually am, because I find the world of humans absolutely confined and uninteresting. I'm just no impressed by our physical abilities.

I can enjoy my friends as they are creative and tell wonderful stories. I can enjoy music, I can enjoy, food, I can enjoy art... I just can't enjoy reality in a physical way because my body is so incredibly fragile and also too short-lived to ever experience something great.

I'm not satisfied with what I have and I will NEVER be able to reach what I want as it's *not physically possible*. Magic isn't possible. I will never be a god shaping the universe by my will while ALSO experiencing the ALWAY NEW AND EVOLVING world OTHERS created in a limited way... 

All I see on this planet is destruction and selfishness of humans... while most of the world is either already discovered and exploited or too harsh to ever witness in any meaningful way.

&gt;are there to teach us about life so that we can better understand ourselves and come to know who we are as individuals

Well, youa re right, they do make us realize what we are... we are fragile, we are pitifully stupid, we are confined in our physical world and we have to make the best out of it. All humans struggle for survival and developement and experiences... and they all die too young and they all don't accomplish much as we humans aren't very powerful.

Well, I usually read books for giving me ideas of what lies *beyond* humanity, as I'm just not very satisfied with humans in general and being human. We are weak and life is uninteresting as our possibilities are so incredibly limited. And we can't possibly go beyond that. 

Maybe YOU are able to experience more than that but I can't! There is no pleasure for me in traveling. Well yes, it's interesting... but just as you expected it. Well, wow this is a brilliant scenery! But why was it so exhausting to go this way, why did it cost so much strength and work and why is it so shortlived? 

&gt;What the fuck do you think Games and books are based on?

On fantasies. On the wishes of people that want to create a world that's *better* than the real world. That's more interesting. That has more possibilities. Exactly.. it's *based* on the real life... fantasy worlds are the improved version of real life. In a fantasy world you can add things which are missing in the real world.

&gt;but I can travel this planet and discover lands so incredibly different and people so unique that everything I thought I once knew is thrown into question

I traveled a lot. I traveled through Scandinavia, through Asia, through the USA, I have been to Egypt, to South Africa, to China, to Cuba, to Iceland, to France, to Italy, to Japan, to India, to Scotland, to Singapore, to Hong Kong... to every other European country... I have traveled so many countries, I have met so many people. I climbed mountains. I swam in the sea. Always in the search of something to satisfy my desire for genuine experiences, from something that's different, from something that elevates me.

Guess what? NOTHING. It was all as expected. The world is beautiful but LIMITED. Also: Your part about meeting different people, one more brilliant than the other isn't really true for me. It's really not my experience. People generally are the SAME, regardless where you go, regardless where you live. All that differs is the culture but deep inside they are all the same. I spent hours smoking waterpipes in Turkey... with people my own age and men much older. Their stories, their feelings, their morals... they are not different from any other human's. Deep down, they have the same motivation, the same wishes, the same dreams.

&gt;what's the difference between traveling to a far off planet and taking a plane and flying to India, Vietnam, Japan, China, wherever?

Completely different cultures, different brains, different morals. You can travel through time and experience culture from its birth up to its demise. In a game you don't feel pain, you don't get sick, you don't have to worry about sleeping somewhere new, you don't have to carry about money, you don't have to worry about your work, about your future... and if you actually have to worry about these things: You still don't worry! If something goes wrong, you will begin anew. Limitless possibilities. You can't waste any second of your time... of your life... in a game. You can just enjoy the moment to the fullest and the always changing and always new beautiful nature and landscapes. The completely different laws of nature...

Everyone has beautiful but vague stories about how to stop giving a crap about what other people think of you, etc. 

*I bought a house.* Two+ years ago. My life has improved tremendously. 

My self respect has increased dramatically when i learned how to build stuff myself. The feeling of accomplishment of having built an entire extention to the house by yourself and fitting an entire luxury bathroom in it is enormous.

My fitness has increased (oh come on! at least SOME!) from renovating the old house. 

My health has increased from all the fresh air and physical activities, i don't think i have been particularly ill the last two years. No sick days that i can remember.

I have become much more organised (compared to before!) as a result of having to manage build projects. My wife helps a tremendous part with this, but at least i feel more connected to planning and economy and stuff like that now.

I have a better personality now, i think, from having to learn new stuff and learning to relate to other people who work with physical stuff. I am a graphic designer, so before i bought a house my life was almost only about computers and virtual stuff. Now i can strike up a real conversation with any 50+ man about tiling roofs or insulating pipe-works or advanced concrete techniques, and with any 50+ woman about animal husbandry on a farm, since we already have a LOT of animals on our little farm.

Fenders will keep your butt, legs, and back dry when there's water on the ground. When it's actively falling from the sky, you'll want some raingear to wear, too.

Ok, so first, I need to imagine something, powerful enough to create, test, design, plan everything in existence, it also must be intelligent enough to do this, furthermore, it must have the ability to manipulate matter through some unknown channels, as we haven't observed any physical pathways of a higher power's manipulation, fine. Then we have to just imagine it can exist out of nothing, or else we have an endless cycle of higher powers. Yeah, that is pretty hard to consider.

&gt;As do black holes and quantum entanglement.

Black holes and quantum entanglement both have testable and measurable effects, god does not.

&gt;Which is precisely what makes an argument against it for someone who sees something extraordinary when they look at the universe. Are you saying scientists who are atheists don't see anything extraordinary when they look at the universe. And for that matter, what is the ordinary that we have to compare the universe to that makes it so extra-ordinary?

I think you misunderstood my statement. I was arguing that the existence of our universe as we know it via trillions of trillions of trillions of atomic and subatomic interactions which have a certain quantum probability of happening (""random chance""), over billions of years isn't extraordinary. I'm not arguing that the universe isn't supremely interesting and beautiful, but it has yet to behave in ways we cannot explain, or attempt to explain.

&gt;Please elucidate these other forgettable occurrences. Isn't it intellectually dishonest to say that the universe is something that happens every once in a while by luck? And why are we so lucky if there is nothing remarkable about it?

This is intellectual Gobbledygook. Stop using the word ""luck"" as if we are gambling, this is not the case. Believing that random interactions can result in order isn't absurd or intellectually dishonest. You are over-evaluating the uniqueness of our current universe. I'll leave you with a quote which illuminates this concept well:

&gt;Imagine a puddle waking up one morning and thinking, 'This is an interesting world I find myself in, an interesting hole I find myself in, fits me rather neatly, doesn't it? In fact it fits me staggeringly well, must have been made to have me in it!' This is such a powerful idea that as the sun rises in the sky and the air heats up and as, gradually, the puddle gets smaller and smaller, it's still frantically hanging on to the notion that everything's going to be alright, because this world was meant to have him in it, was built to have him in it; so the moment he disappears catches him rather by surprise. I think this may be something we need to be on the watch out for.' - Douglas Adams",1278940329,"i'm not arguing that the universe isn't supremely interesting and beautiful, but it has yet to behave in ways we cannot explain, or attempt to explain.  &gt;please elucidate these other forgettable occurrences.","interesting and beautiful","beautiful",NA,FALSE,"supremely interesting and beautiful","interesting",NA,"supremely",0

I visited my sister in Houston these past couple of weeks. While she was at work, I hung around the house all day (no money to go out, see) and quickly learned how to use her DV-R. That thing was amazing; if there were two things I wanted to watch, I could simply record one, watch the other, and then when there was a lull in live programming, watch the recorded program. There was no time during the day or night when I didn't have something to watch. After I returned to Austin this weekend, I realized I had gotten no work done in Houston and that my life was not in any way enhanced by the countless reruns of Seinfeld, Futurama, Family Guy, and Simpsons or the shows on Travel Channel, G4, Comedy Central, and Cooking Channel. I also realized that I still have no reason to invest in cable.

This starts from the minute you step into a store - there are so many ""gotchas"" and catch-22s when it comes to buying a phone and plan through Verizon that you'd need a lawyer to sit down with you to make sure you're really getting what you want. 

Once you buy a phone, you have to read the manual to make sure buttons do what you expect. Hitting the ""up"" button on many phones takes you straight to the internet, which if you don't have a data plan is an automatic charge. There is no way to configure this shortcut on any Verizon phone I've owned.

When billing problems inevitably arrive, you might as well just suck it up as a loss, because Verizon will never *actually* do anything about it all. You'll sit on the phone for two hours going back and forth between two departments who don't have a fucking clue what they're doing until you finally get transferred to someone who appears to understand the issue. They'll promise you everything is fine and that the issue will be fixed on the next billing cycle. And then, the next bill comes and it's either the same issue or some new headache to deal with.

"c0r0u7b","Actually i have not played it since the 1980s. It was originally an Avalon Hill game. Avalon Hill was a war board game company in Baltimore, Maryland where i was born and raised. They published the very first commercial war game in 1958 called [Tactics II](http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/1574/tactics-ii) which i received on my twelfth birthday in 1968.

Avalon Hill was bought by Monarch Press and ceased making war games sometime in the 1990s i think.

Squad Leader was originally published in segments. Each boxed set came with at least one and sometimes several isometric boards that could be placed end to end and/or side by side to create a hex map of varying terrain. Also included were game counters representing units from World War II and assorted player aids such as smoke counters and ""spotted"" counters. Scenario cards were included as well so you could set up a game with objectives for each player and play. Unfortunately each set also came with a rule book with ever expanding and updated rules.

I say unfortunately because it meant the rules from one module would contradict the previous modules.

The solution Avalon Hill came up with was to create a beautiful but expensive rule book in a binder so that new rules could replace old ones by being included in newer modules. Simply remove the old pages and insert the new ones.

This had two effects. It made unlearning and learning the new rules a bit of a task. It also facilitated the creation of arguably *the* best tactical war game ever made.

Learning to play this game can be daunting. They have a ""Starter Kit"" which is a free adobe download to help you get a taste of what is to come. Almost all (if not all) aspects of World War II combat is in this game including snipers, sewer movement, paratroopers, pontoon bridge building and panic. You name it and it is in there.

Every vehicle that participated in WWII from bicycles to rocket launchers are included.

It can be a really fun game but you will have to make a commitment to learn a lot if you want to play it.

There is a system for playing online which looks pretty good. Basically it allows the players to set up the boards as the scenarios call for (you can also create your own easily by selecting your own units using a point system) placing and moving your units and sharing dice rolls to resolve combat and the other aspects of the game.

Yes it is fun. No it is not cheap.

The hitman informs her that she will find a blue key when it is done.  She also sees a waitress with her other character's name.  She finds the key and immediately feels remorse, ultimately committing suicide.  Note that this segment of the movie is pretty straightforward and realistic.  It has a definite thematic feel and it sticks with that.  
  
The first portion of the movie is imagined by Watt's dying character.  She hasn't been immediately killed by the bullet and is basically comatose.  In this world, Watt's character attempts to construct the world as she wants it to be.  Thus, she is a young new actress coming into Hollywood.  She no longer has the years of baggage she did in real life and has a chance to do it again from scratch.  She also meets the woman she loves who she imagines in this world to be the same woman but having survived the hit, absconding her from guilt.  This time, Harring's character is vulnerable and badly needs the attention of Watt's character, thus they are more stable.  There are dream like elements to this world, such as the blue box and the blue key that is oddly shaped.  There are film genre mixtures throughout, some dark comedy (the hit that goes awry), some horror (the hobo), and some romance (Watts and Harring), again all thematically ranged because they are dreams and fit into their film genres (since Watt's character is an actress).  However, as the mystery continues, the real Watts approaches death and as such her world begins to unravel.  She sees her real name on the waitress, a reminder of what she has done, and the opera singer falls revealing her beautiful song to be fake, just as Watt's character's created life is beautiful but fake.  She and Harring find her real dead body in her dream as well, showing what is inevitable.  Ultimately, they find the blue key, dream world version, the last reminder of the real world.  Watts opens the box and as such, dies.  
  
The Cowboy represents to me a breaking of the fourth wall, not anything that effects the story one way or the other within the continuity of the film, but as standing in for Lynch speaking to the audience and giving them a hint.

"c0qngwe","I've been to all those places, except for Dublin, which I'll be in, in a week and a half.  I was quite recently in Venice, so that section will be a bit longer.

**Paris** has SO much to see, if you like to sight-see, you will not run out of things to see and places to go.  Versailles was cool as a day trip, and didn't really take that long to get to.  If you want to save a little bit of time and money (and are in decent shape), walk up the first part of the Eiffel Tower rather than taking the elevator.  The catacombs are also cool, and if you need a hostel, check out St. Christopher's, really nice place to stay. The Louvre will require a good portion of a day if you'd like to really look around a lot.

**Rome** also has a ton to see, make sure to bring a water bottle!  Water is REALLY expensive at the little snack carts in the touristy areas, but there are a lot of free public fountains you can use if you have your own bottle.  Pay to take the audio guide at the Coliseum, it's not that much more money, and it lets you skip the **enormous** regular line up.  

The Spanish Steps are a little overrated, so if you don't have the extra time, don't bother.  Most of the touristy things in Rome are in the same sort of area, so if you plan your route properly you can see a lot of stuff in one day without having to do too much backtracking.  The public transportation network is pretty cheap and works decently too, so don't be afraid to give it a shot.  

Also, try pizza and gelato there! at many different shops, they're almost all quite good, and can be found for quite cheap as well.  Schedule a good chunk of the day for the Vatican and Sistine Chapel, and I would recommend going with one of the tour groups that meets nearby.  It saves you having to wait in huge lines (unless you're there quite early), and lets you get directly into the Sistine Chapel after the Vatican (without having to wait in another lineup).  

Also, if you're into drinking and partying, the pub crawl that meets in front of the Coliseum is good times!

**Venice** is beautiful, but there's really not a TON of things to see there.  I recently posted this, in response to someone that was going there soon.. I'll copy and paste:

&gt; First thing you should know, you need a map. If you book a hotel before hand, I definitely suggest printing out Google Maps directions along with the actual picture itself.
&gt; 
&gt; The addresses in Venice don't have street names attached, rather it will just say #2342 Cannaregio. Venice has a handful of ""sestieres"" or sections, and the addresses just have a number attached to the front.
&gt; 
&gt; Anyway, they will suggest you buy a transit pass while you are there. It gives you unlimited use of the water busses on the ACTV system. You can get around pretty much the entire city on foot, but if you don't mind spending the money, it was 22‚Ç¨ for a 3 day pass if you're a student, and they include a student card that gets you reduced prices at some restaurants and museums. It was about 6-8‚Ç¨ more for the 3 day pass if you aren't a student.
&gt; 
&gt; Although Venice is beautiful, if museums and walking around a lot aren't your thing, you will likely run out of things to do after a couple of days.
&gt; 
&gt; There are over 100 churches, so I can't even begin to suggest which ones are best to see. Make sure you spend a good amount of time in Piazza San Marco and the Basilica di San Marco (the most famous and beautiful). You can go inside of the church and view from the balcony at the top of the church, also, you can go up to the top of the bell tower right next to the church.
&gt; 
&gt; The Palazzo Ducale is right next to the Basilica di San Marco as well, and is where the Doges used to live, very beautiful as well.
&gt; 
&gt; Many of the attractions (including the Basilica and Palazzo) had a fair amount of scaffolding for repairs/etc., so unfortunately some of the sights were not as nice as I'm sure they would have been otherwise.
&gt; 
&gt; The Castello sestiere was nice, and much less touristy, although the churches and sights were not quite as breathtaking as in the other sections. As well, it's a bit out of the way and takes much longer to walk there or boat there than the other areas.
&gt; 
&gt; I really recommend spending the majority of your time in the Santa Croce, San Polo, and San Marco sestieres, as they are definitely the most interesting.
&gt; 
&gt; My best suggestion would be to simply start walking around, and only reference your map every 10-15 minutes to regain a bearing for where you are. There are simply too many little streets to bother keeping track of where you are at all times. As well, you tend to see some beautiful areas if you just lose yourself in the city.
&gt; 
&gt; The Lido (a very long, skinny island) is really the only place to find a beach. The beach, however, is really set up for masses of tourists, and the island wasn't all that interesting. It is the only place you'll find cars and regular streets in Venice, and because of that is a pain to get anywhere distant on foot.
&gt; 
&gt; I would highly recommend going to the little islands of Murano and Burano. Murano is where all of the blown glass factories are, and the shops there sell authentic blown glass pieces (very beautiful, and make for excellent gifts). There is a blown glass museum there, but it cost 5‚Ç¨ or so, and took all of 10 minutes to go through. It wasn't very interesting, and we actually enjoyed ourselves more browsing the bigger blown glass stores with all of their objects for sale.
&gt; 
&gt; There are excellent restaurants most everywhere, but they can be quite expensive (especially for drinks - alcoholic or not!). A large Coca-Cola, on ""draft"" (aka fountain drink) cost ‚Ç¨12 at one restaurant. But if you can find a grocery store (tend to not be very obvious, and they're all quite small) you can find very inexpensive wine (and food if you so wish).
&gt; 
&gt; Also, they sell gelato and pizza EVERYWHERE, and they're both very cheap. Beware, however, the prices are almost the same everywhere, but the quality levels differ widely! Go to places where the customers are speaking Italian, they tended to be the best as the locals actually went there.
&gt; 
&gt; Another thing, the stores there all sell the SAME THINGS. There are two types of blown glass stores in the main part of Venice, the ones that sell Chinese knockoffs, and the ones that sell the Murano made glass. All the knockoff stores sell the same stuff at each store, and likewise with the authtentic stores.
&gt; 
&gt; There are also mask stores, authentic and knockoffs. As well as a thousand souvenir shops and stands that all sell the same things too.
&gt; 
&gt; To put it mildly, with only a few exceptions, shopping in Venice is very overrated.

"c0qnatu","Portland, OR or Vancouver, BC are both incredible food towns.  The climate will be beautiful but mild (think sunny in mid-70F's, and the likelihood of rain will be very small) and the scenery is incredible as well.  As far as food, each have separate types of offerings.

Portland, OR is relatively cheap with a number of unbelievable food choices.  Aside from most every type of mid-range to pricey restaurant any good city should have, I feel the majority of offerings in the lower tiers really thrive in terms of quality.  For instance, there are ~600 food carts strewn around the city, many offering mid-range quality food for just a few dollars.  [Food Carts Portland blog](http://www.foodcartsportland.com/) is a good place to start.  Portland also sits in a very fertile valley along the Columbia River.  As a result, there is an emphasis on locally grown, fresh ingredients.  The other thing Portland has going for it is it sits, IMO, as the US's crowning example of a beer city.  There are more breweries per capita in Portland than any other city in the country (32 as of [this statistic](http://www.sloshspot.com/blog/04-13-2009/US-Breweries-per-Capita-Map-143)).  

I am less familiar with Vancouver, BC (not the one in WA just across the river from Portland), and have not visited since before the run-up to the Olympics, so things may have changed for the better (such as number of quality offerings), or the worse (such as prices).  Vancouver is a world-class city as Tokyo, New York, London, Singapore, etc. is.  As a result, the food offerings, in terms of variety and scale of quality, reflect this.  It is easily among the most picturesque cities in the Western hemisphere, and finding a quality restaurant with outdoor dining to take this in will be quite easy.  In terms of locally grown food, as well as quality of beer, Vancouver is similar to Portland, but the emphasis of either seems to be on a smaller scale.  Where Vancouver thrives is higher-end restaurants and the offerings from the immense Asian population.  Coming from Japan you might avoid the amazing sushi and ramen places, but the Chinese, Vietnamese, Thai and Indian choices are innumerable and some especially incredible.

The best part about both Portland and Vancouver is they are distinctly different but only ~8hrs apart.  You could visit both quite thoroughly in a week.  The Amtrak Cascades line runs between the two along the shore and you get better scenery than on the highway.  I say fly into Portland, take the Amtrak, and fly out of Vancouver.  Both have wonderful public transit systems, so if you skipped the rental car, you'd be just fine for getting around, including to and from the airport.

EDIT: Yes, the train goes right through Seattle.  Seattle is a fine city as well, but IMO not as strong on the foodie offerings as Vancouver or Portland.

There is hope, I am an American and have a beautiful Italian fiance from Sardegna.

If you do travel by public service, expect nothing to be on time not even the bus to take you down the street.  If you have a choice, do not fly with any Italian airline, Lufthansa is a good option.  If you travel by train and that motherfucker is late take your ass to the office and you can fill out paper work for a partial refund it does take 6-8 months, but, you will eventually receive it. Also, the bathrooms are fucking absolutely disgusting everywhere you go (I was in Iraq for 13 months, all over western Europe and I have never seen nasty like the Italian bathroom).  Strangely, Italian homes are normally extremely clean.

It can be hard to find a decent restaurant, look for a place with Italians not tourists.  You will be absolutely disappointed with Italian food unless you follow this advice.

Berlusconi, the Italian prime minister, is a liar and a thief.  He represents everything that is wrong with Italy.  Watch the Italian news and you will realize there are very few reports on how bad the economy is or what the unemployment rate is.  The Italian public did not know they were in complete shit because of the bullshit in Greece.  They have state run channels and everything is great in Italy.  Unions are strong and there are monthly strikes which will also affect public bus and train services.

All in all and on the upside, Italy is a beautiful country with a few horrible people that have complete control of the country, business and economy.  Also, all Italian websites are horrible. Don't give the Gypsies money. That is all.

"c0pwehs","Really interesting.

&gt; The picture above is from the biography and Wilson got it from Highsmith‚Äôs papers in a Swiss archive.  It‚Äôs  unusual for a biography of a novelist to have a nude photo of the subject, but this one is so intriguing that the story would be much less without it.  It‚Äôs a visual sign of the forces in her life: she‚Äôs beautiful, a lesbian, promiscious, but completely unhappy and unsatisfied in romance.  She looks so innocent and beautiful but is driven above all else to write dark novels aboout psychopaths.  And all of these charactersitics are related, of course, and it would be easy to construct reasons for everything: because she was a lesbian in a time when it wasn‚Äôt accepted she was forced outside conventional society; because of her looks, and later her fame, she could sleep with many people, but because of her childhood, or ambition or the lack of a model of a lesbian marriage, she never was satisfied.  But that‚Äôs the drawback of biography ‚Äì it tempts you to find a story, with cause and effect, where there is none.  We can‚Äôt really say why we did something we did ourselves, much less look back fifty years to letters and facts and say she did this because of that.  And of course that‚Äôs the appeal of fiction ‚Äì the author creates the characters and leads you from cause to effect.  But even that can be too tidy, and there are some quotes from Highsmith‚Äôs letters in which she repsonds to a publisher or reviewer calling her characters ‚Äòinconsistent‚Äô by saying that inconsistency is what makes them real.

"c0ppnmo","Okay- here's the thing: I was an archivist for a major pop artist and now I run an art gallery in New York. As a gallerist, I am the gate keeper to success in the art world. (Not me specifically, but people who do my job). 

1. Keep track of every single painting, drawing or sketch you do. Every single one. Create a database of every last piece. Image (photo or scan) Title, Year, Medium, size, where it's signed, etc. FileMaker is good for this, but you can also use Office or whatever. This is important!
Most artists don't even think about doing this until 20 years into their career and it can cause major problems down the road. I cannot stress enough that you track/archive/record all your work. 

2. Do not waste your time and money sending unsolicited CDs/slides/post cards/emails out to galleries. 99.999% of the time these get thrown away without even being looked at. Sometimes something might catch someone's eye, but not most of the time. If you show up with your portfolio without an appointment, you're going to get turned away by the receptionist. Galleries are always looking for new artists, but they are also looking for the right artist. Remember, a gallery is going to invest several thousands of dollars taking you on. So, what do you do? Go look at galleries in your area or online. Find the very few where your art would fit. Call them, make an appointment to meet with the owner/director. Don't even bring up your art, just ask for advice. I've never met anyone that wasn't willing to hand out free advice to someone starting out. But, establishing a personal relationship is crucial. They may not like your art, they may not want to represent you, but they may know someone who will, they may know someone who can guide you or help you. Meeting people for real is important. You're lucky right now that you're a kid...people are more willing to help out a kid then a 40 year old. It's not fair, but that's how it is. Go meet people in the art world, talk them, solicit their advice and take it to heart. 

3. Go to college. Major in Business, minor in art. The art world is not about beauty, creativity or wonder. That's the art hobby. The art world is a serious business. The artists I've met who had a good head for business and finance were the successful ones. If you don't know how to handle your own accounting and money, you will probably get screwed over quickly and often. You don't need an art degree and you certainly don't need an art Master's Degree. You do, however, definitely need to understand how the real business world works. You're not creating a thing of beauty, if you want to be successful you are creating a commercial product. A commercial product can be artistic and beautiful, but in the end, it is a product like a can of peas or a pair of shoes. 

4. Work on your art every chance you get and push yourself as hard as you can. Do not settle into a style, theme or series at this point. You're 17 and you have a long way to go. If you have one type of painting and that's it, then you are seriously limiting your chances. If you have only five finished paintings, no one is going to take you seriously. Paint often, go out of your comfort zone and try different things. Learn every technique out there. A serious guitarist isn't one who plays only power-chords and a serious artist isn't one who can only paint one style and one subject.  I would say that before you even approach a gallery as an artist with work for sale, you should have at least 40 paintings comprising three different ""shows."" Say 10-15 in a style or theme. 

5. Set up a table on Saturdays on the street if you have to. Street artists can make serious money depending on where they are. It gets your work out there, people see it, you can sell stuff. Participate in any group shows you find (search them out) and look for commercial work as well. Some people see commercial work as beneath them, but I can't think of a successful artist I know who doesn't do commercial work. 

6. As a person note after looking at your art; learn to paint photo-realistically. A problem that a lot of art students have and art teachers let them get away with  is never actually learning how to paint. It bothers me that art teachers will let high school kids get away with their ""style"" and never push them to learn the fundamentals. Learn to paint. Learn photo-realism and you can paint anything you want. Look at Dali and Picasso's earliest work and they were painting almost photo-realistically. Once you learn the fundamentals you can then do anything you want. A virtuoso piano player can still play chopsticks if they want, but they can also play Mozart. Someone who only learns chopsticks can only ever play chopsticks. 

So, don't get discouraged, but paint, paint, and paint some more. Learn everything you can and get as much advise as possible from meeting people in the art world. You've a long way to go, but if your heart and mind are in it, there's nothing stopping you from being successful.

Everyone that had abandoned her the previous 18 years went political.  White washing, damage control, religious lessons, furthering their own philosophical agendas.  It was enough to make a person sick.  The immediate family couldn't afford the funeral so other family had to pitch in, and so every one who did felt like their money got them mike time.  This included the mention that god hates suicide and send them to hell.

Luckily the girls aunt jumped in, took over and gave it the dignity it needed.  She kept things moving, got her own children to sing and play music, told stories and memories, and cut short the religious twists.  That day everyone was emotionally exhausted.  If not for mourning, than at least from rage, hypocrisy thinly veiled insults.

The was a lot of issues over decorating casket.  The girls sisters wanted to cover it with stickers and the rest of the family objected.  The compromise was to cover it with stickers just before the hearse left, anyone that wanted to join in could.

There are a lot of things you can do. Knee-length skirts are good, with a classy pair of sandals. Shirts that have higher necklines and aren't skin-tight work, too; they can be jazzed up with a nice necklace. You want to pick pieces that are tailored and classic but still pretty. If you want ideas or places to find clothes, just google ""modest clothing' and check out the sites that come up. 

Don't do yourself the disservice of confusing modesty with frumpiness. Modesty is great, but frumpiness will just make you miserable. You don't have to pick between hiding and displaying. You should wear things you like that flatter you. It takes some digging but it's totally possible to look stylish and classy without showing off too much.

There is a very large difference between something being art, and something being *bad art*. A lot of people want to look at artistic pieces they don't like and say ""this isn't art.""

"c0npr86","Portuguese :)

No it's not. English is absolutely easy, maybe learning to write and be fluent it's hard. But to get to a conversational level. Think about it, verbs and nouns don't change independent of tense and gender . There are a few irregular verbs (Go - went) and you need to learn a few suffixes (ing, ed, s) but they apply to all words, both genders in that tense (Again, only a few irregulars) In fact, the endings are an advantage because you can completely make up verbs just by adding them to convey and exclusive meaning which makes sense in that context. English is extremely flexible. In other latin languages such as Spanish, Portuguese and French (possibly Italian and Romanian too) the verb changes depending on tense, gender and pronoun. Just as example take the verb walk.

**In English:** I walk, you walk, he walks, she walks, they walk, we walk.

**In Portuguese:** Eu caminho, Tu caminhas, Ele caminha, Ela caminha, Eles caminham, Nos caminhamos, Vos caminha (Actually, I don't know how to conjugate the verb here).

Now take when you are referring to something. You say a table, the table or a stove, the stove. Easy. In other languages you need to consider whether the noun is feminine or not. Table (Mesa) is feminine because it ends with an 'a' so you say '*a* mesa'. A stove is masculine (Fog√£o) so you say '*o* fog√£o'. Same with adjectives, you change the ending depending on gender. I'd say portuguese is simple enough generally speaking if a word ends with anything but 'a' it's masculine. French though, god, French is a bitch for this.

Then you have loads of rules of pronounciation, spelling (ch, nh, lh, rr, ss, √ß) and accents  (√£o, √¢, √†, √°). Another funzie? The 'H' in portuguese is completely mute, you hardly ever pronounce it, normally only when paired with another letter like above. But we still use it for spelling. AWESOME We have more than 5 different tenses and in general the language is very complicated. To give you an idea, the Brazilian government actually simplified the language about 2 years ago, trying to get rid of a few accents and weird spelling. I don't think it went down very well though, seems most people still use the old style. 

My biggest struggles with english are pronouncing words like 'two' because I pronounce the 'w', words with 'on' and 'om' like monkey (Pronounced manky) and 'donkey' (danky) and prepositions. Prepositions I find quite difficult to get used to. Are you on a bus or in a bus? That sorta thing I get mixed up constantly still.

Even if the spelling in English is hard, now that I'm learning French I can bitch about their spelling which is the most bizarre non-sense I've ever encoutered. Sounds beautiful but fuck,  a word with one phoneme normally has about 3 or 4 syllables. If I had to criticise english for anything it would be that because it's simple, the writing is not as light and as descriptive as other languages. French, Spanish, Portuguese, etc all have words for all sorts of colours, nuances, feelings and sentiments whether with English I find quite hard to be as descriptive. In my english class we had to write a short story once and my teacher said that he'd be able to say I'm South American by my writing style alone which was light, full of emotions and very descriptive according to him.

If you want another example, portuguese has one of the hardest words to translate to any other language, the word (saudade) describes the feeling and the particular sadness of missing someone or something. 'I miss you' is not the same, but the closest translation in English.

"c0n2g8k","I went to Cuba a year and a half ago.  I flew in from Mexico City.  The best conversion from money from what I understood was actually from dollars to EUROs.  Then change the EUROS there.  You must visit La Havana.  It's amazing.  La Havana Vieja is beautiful, and the buildings have been remodeled.  The center of La Havana looks like it's crumbling and yet it's not...it is almost like at times you are INSIDE a black &amp; white photograph as there is no paint on the buildings.

La Havana Center, Vieja are the best.  I also went to Matanzas which I don't really recommend...there's a beach there that is very touristy (and beautiful) nearby.  I believe the beach is Verradero...I can't remember the exact name.  Beautiful but again touristy.  But I liked La Havana much better.

That being said, just get ready for prostitutes, pimps, drugs, etc.  Under no condition buy drugs of course on the street.  No prostitutes straight off the street either.  Cuba is very much a police state so you never know how quickly you can get in trouble with the law.  Prostitution is illegal in Cuba, they will arrest the prostitutes if they see them...so they usually hang down dark alleyways while some guys will try and get you to go visit them.  

That being said Cuba is very safe.  But the way the currency system works you can't blame Cubans for wanting your money CUs.  The Cuban money is devalued to the point of being worthless...so the things you get to do, like sit down in a nice restaurant, eat beef, have a beer, they don't.  So you can make friends quickly and take them out; but just know you have to pay for everything.  If that doesn't bother you (and it shouldn't...it can be fun) then do it.  

The women in Cuba well...they are 80% beautiful.  Just...stunning, I don't know.  It's pretty amazing.  It's an island of beauty, it can feel like paradise in that respect.  But be careful you know...everyone is trying to scam everyone (Cubans to Cubans too).

In terms of passport you don't have to say anything.  They will not stamp your passport, they stamp a VISA.  They will ask to see your passport.  They know you don't want it stamped.  They don't stamp ANYONE's passport, because if you ever go to the U.S. (no matter where you are from) and they see you went to Cuba you can have problems.  The Mexicans I were with did not have their passport stamped either.

THERE IS AN EXIT tax to leave Cuba.  This almost fucked me.  It's 35 CU's (35 dollars.)  Make sure to have it, so you can leave!!  Also the VISA costs somewhere similar.  Make sure to get a hotel deal before you go; it is CHEAPER to do that than just arrive and book a hotel.  Get a hotel deal for a week in La Havana and you'll save lots of money.

La Havana Vieja was my favorite place in my short time there...ok that's my best advice.  If you like cigars don't buy them in a store, find someone (some of the security will help you) and you can buy a box for like 30 Cus.  They buy the box for 15 Cus, so they 15 CUs off of it...but hey...that's why you get it cheap.  I got boxes of Cohibas and sold them in Mexico when I returned.

Have an amazing time!  If you decide to drive, which I did...be aware that the highways have very few signs, it's easy to get lost, there are no highway lights at points, no lines on the road, can be nearly impossible to see.

I think it's important to understand that deep inside every fundamentalist's mind is the fear that their whole world could unravel if they tugged on one loose thread.

"c0mt9ml","Well - I have a Palm Pre that I got on launch day last year, and there are things I love about my Pre, and things that frustrate me to no end.  

**The Good**
The UI is beautiful and intuitive.  The gesture pad is a great idea, managing ""program windows"" is elegantly implemented.  And I love that it automatically brings in my contacts from Facebook and Gmail - the first time someone called me who I'd never put in my phonebook and their photo showed up (they were a facebook contact who had their phone number listed on their profile) - it blew my mind.   

The phone is totally hackable, and Palm engineers have been really helpful to the hacking community.  In fact, it was rooted pretty quickly after being released because Palm engineers dropped hints in the hacking forums.  

**Now the Bad**
Either the phone is underpowered, or memory management is piss-poor.  Programs can take an awful long time to load, and when you have more than a couple memory-intensive apps open, your phone crawls and hangs frequently.  Often, I can have 0 apps open, try to open a 3d game, and get a ""Too Many Cards"" (out of memory) error.

"c0mrs4m","yeah, the bombings are only justified IMO on utilitarian grounds, bringing the end of the war on our terms with minimal loss of life.

The Imperial Japanese Army was one sick institution and was not willing to surrender to our justice. In their mind, the Pacific War was really the Greater East Asian War, and the Japanese were the masters of East Asia and the Army was going to fight to the last man, woman, and child to stay there.

Revisionists who say the Japanese were close to surrendering in 1945 are full of shit. The Army was not close to surrendering, and threatened another bloody purging of the state apparat if such weakness became official policy.

As late as mid-July the ""Peace Faction"" of the Foreign Ministry was attempting to get Stalin involved in some sort of diplomacy initiative. The Japanese ambassador to Stalin, Naotake Sato, said this in reply:

""In the unreserved opinion of this envoy and on the basis of your telegram No. 885, I believe it no exaggeration to say that the possibility of getting the Soviet Union to join our side and go along with our reasoning is next to nothing. That would run directly counter to the foreign policy of this country as explained in my frequent telegrams to you. It goes without saying that the objectives cannot be successfully attained by sounding out the possibilities of using the Soviet Union to terminate the war on the above basis. This is clearly indicated in the progress of the conference as reported in my telegram No. 1379.

""Moreover, the manner of your explanation in your telegram No. 891 --""We consider the maintenance of peace in Asia as one aspect of maintaining world peace""-- is nothing but academic theory. For England and American are planning to take the right of maintaining peace in East Asia away from Japan, and the actual situation is now such that the mainland of Japan itself is in peril. Japan is no longer in a position to be responsible for the maintenance of peace in all of East Asia, no matter how you look at it.

""2. Although the Empire and its commanders have said, ""We have no intention of annexing or taking possession of the areas which we have been occupying,"" what kind of reaction can we expect when in fact we have already lost or about to lose Burma, the Philippines, and even a portion of our mainland in the form of Okinawa?

""As you already know, the thinking of the Soviet authorities is realistic. It is difficult to move them with abstractions, to say nothing about the futility of trying to get them to consent to persuasion with phrases beautiful but somewhat remote from the facts and empty in content. In fact, with reference to your proposal in telegram No. 853, Molotov does not show the least interest. And again, in his refusal he gave a very similar answer. ***If indeed our country is pressed by the necessity of terminating the war, we ourselves must first of all firmly to terminate the war.*** Without this resolution, an attempt to sound out the intentions of the Soviet Union will result in no benefit. In these days, with the enemy air raids accelerated and intensified, is there any meaning in showing that our country has reserve strength for a war of resistance, or in sacrificing the lives of hundreds of thousands of conscripts and millions of other innocent residents of cities and metropolitan areas?""

"c0l4gyy","edit: Wow, sorry for the TL;DR post. I didn't realize I wrote this much. Hopefully it's helpful anyway. Skip the boring parts, I know I ramble :-)

Look on Amazon for a series of 5 books called Mathematics for Self Study, by JE Thompson. These books were originally published in 1931. I think the 1946 edition is the best (I think they were all printed on a linotype machine, but the equation typesetting in the 31--42 editions was jagged compared to the 46). Each book can be had used for around 5-10 USD. These books, each entitled ""X for the Practical Man"", where X is one of {Arithmetic, Algebra, Geometry, Trigonometry, Calculus}, were what taught a young Richard Feynman (the Physics Nobel Laureate) mathematics. I think these are also the math books Knuth was talking about when he noted that Monotype Modern 8a was the inspiration for the Computer Modern font because it looks like these books were typeset with TeX despite being older than Knuth himself.

They are not currently in print, but there have been recent re-runs, and there are many old copies available.

They're simply better than any conventional math texts I've seen. The prose is easy to read, but not overly simple. Since it was written in 31 it has a sort of quondam tone, but I think it comes across better that way -- Thompson assumes the reader knows nothing, but doesn't patronize and doesn't hide anything. The examples are realistic and interesting, and the exercises are useful without being lengthy or overly difficult. The beginning of the series would be a great way to get started with math.

The best book in the series is Calculus for the Practical Man, simply because it doesn't introduce limits until the final chapters by which time the reader will know calculus through and through. This book took me from failing the subject to mastery because of its approach, the likes of which I see in very few texts.

A good book to read to understand not *what* to do in math, but rather how to approach any problem, is How To Solve It by George Polya. This is also another incredibly inexpensive gem that will give you the heuristics, tools, and methods you need no matter what kind of problem you face. It's essentially a lesson in how to think effectively to solve problems. This book is simply a must-have for any mathematician, professional or layman, period. No library is complete without it.

Arithmetic the Easy Way also sounds wonderful.

P.S. (off-topic):
If anyone knows about the rights to these books, I'm interested in digital copies for my personal archive.

When you have a two goal lead against what is suppose to be the best team ever assembled.

"c0l1rzq","Although not a native speaker, I was a Spanish Lit major and have read quite a bit of Spanish and Latin American Literature. Xyos provides fantastic examples of great literature, much of which I read in 11th and 12th grade, but I still think the level may be a bit higher than what you're looking for. 

Many of these books are somewhat heavy and often involve narrative styles that are challenging even for a native speaker (circular narration, stream of consciousness, etc). A lot of them also are period pieces that have old-timey vocabulary that isn't *as* useful to learn as something more contemporary. Additionally, some are extremely slow on purpose (eg el coronel no tiene quien le escriba) and might be a bit plodding for someone just getting into Spanish lit (don't get me wrong, I loved that book).

Prairies - Mostly harmless.  Regina is hell on earth.  Avoid.

Ontario - The northern parts are mostly forests and small mining towns.  The southern parts like to think they are America.  Toronto likes to think it's New York City.  The people even look American. This is where Canada is the most... American.  If you're trying to get away from all that 'Americanness', I'd avoid Ontario. 

Quebec- Beautiful in the rural areas.  Montreal is very cool, but a little cold to strangers and it's fucking dangerous to be a pedestrian.  The women are beautiful, but very snooty.  Nice to visit.

The Maritimes - Nicest people ON EARTH.  Prove me wrong.  Beautiful in a rugged way.  Very cheap to live.  Kitchen parties!  Actual history and culture, unlike most of the rest of the country.  Wonderful people all-around.

There's tons of versions of the story, of course, but none of them are happy. The one I heard in German class from a children's fairytale book (no joke) went like this:

Lorelei is super pretty. All the men in town are driven to distraction by her. Shit's not going too well, marriage-wise, for the other ladies since everyone just wants in Lorelei's pants. She, however, has eyes just for one man: her sailor love who is away on a long journey! So she endures the harassment of these men in the meantime (some stories say she can't resist their advances and causes great mayhem in the well-to-do town by sleeping with them all).

The women in the town appeal to the religious authorities to get this chick in reign. ""Yo Bishop,"" they say, ""Can't you get rid of her? Can we stone her or something? She is just *too pretty.* We can't handle this shit, being poor ugly peasants."" So the bishop says ""Lorelei, get thee to a convent!"" 

This would, of course, prevent her from having a happy life with her one true love, so she's understandably a bit broken up about it. Said one true love is due to arrive the next day, so she pleads and begs to be able to watch the horizon from the rocks next to the Rhine for her love's ship so she can see him one last time before being sent away forever. The bishop consents.

At long last, the ship appears! The sailors, poor sex-starved men who've seen nary a woman in months, espy her in all her radiant beauty on the rocks and are so distracted that they lose control of the ship. Her love, along with all the rest of the sailors, is dashed upon the rocks and dies horribly. So she jumps off the cliff and kills herself on the rocks that killed her love. Now she haunts the rocks and sings a sad siren song, sitting and waiting for her love to come back to her for all eternity.

(This was after taking the acid, then deciding to get something to eat. Unfortunately, it was close to dinner time so the place was really busy. I ordered some mozzarella sticks and by the time they came the acid was starting to kick in. I took one bite and felt immediately terrible and decided we needed to leave, so we went to the beach) I gave him all but one of his markers back, and decided I wanted to go back to my apartment because I was shivering and didn't know why (It was cold out, but I couldn't feel a thing). I walked back with my then-boyfriend, remembering how it seemed like photos or stop motion because I kept looking back and everything got slowly further away. We ran into all my roommates (7 of them!) and they got so close to me and really in my face, so I just ran away from them. The one girl's eyes were huge and beautiful, but terrifying. (Later another roommate told them why I was like that and they left me alone.)

My then-boyfriend wanted to get some weed to smoke, but I didn't have any. I called someone else I knew around town and we managed to convince him to come to my apartment because I was too scared to walk down the street. During this time, I called the guy who I took the marker from crying hysterically about how I used it all. He was at a party somewhere, and I kept telling everyone that I really missed this guy. (even though my then-boyfriend was right next to me) I wanted him to come continue his trip with us, but he wouldn't. I went on about this marker literally all night. 

The guy who was selling the weed came by, and he just looked extremely pleasant to me. He was very soft spoken and kind, and I asked him to stay with us but he wouldn't. I also told him he looked exactly like my uncle, which from then on ruined my perception of him because I used to find him attractive before that. 

The rest of the night was spent in my room, in the dark with my then-boyfriend. He tried to get close to me and I wanted nothing to do with him. I scribbled in a sketchpad for a few hours and woke up to a book filled with scribbles that I honestly thought were moon craters. As well as many scribbles about the gold marker which had run out of ink. One was, **""I'm so terribly sorry for using all of your marker... despite it being a wonderful gold!!!""**

Then just to rub it in that great man who did so much to change the world for the better smashes our illusions of grandeur in his epic 'Peer Gynt' where without doubt he displays the fallacy of personal exceptionalism and ensures us all the button maker we will surely meet.  It's enlightening to look at works but then depressing to look a lives; Orwell, Kafka, Nietzsche, Voltaire, Wilde, even Ibsen - stories to tragic even in their most frightful imaginings they never writ a thing that could match the actual horror of the truth.  They, out of the many were lucky, the sader stories which end without greatness are forgotten -maybe went forever untold.  These few great men managed to actually get the breaks they sought and yet still nothing but suffering and pain presented itself to them.  
  
I understand people all too well, when i look about all i see is suffering equal to or grater than mine - I can't bring myself to add to the general pool of pain in the world, i couldn't careless about myself, i might as well be dead already - yet, i understand to best help others i must first help myself.  I live a good life, i have many good friends, in this regard i am very lucky - I'll doubt i'll ever find anyone that i can love beyond friendship in part because i respect the truth of situations too much, I can't pretend to be something i'm not just to get something i don't really want... It sounds silly when put simply but for certain i can say all evidence and deep contemplation over years of attempted answer finding have resulted in my unshakable belief it's true.  If science proved tomorrow that people can be biologically asexual then i would say i am asexual however i don't necessarily think it's true (and i've looked into the matter most throughly) i would say that i'm mentally *above* the psychical compulsion to procreate, my thought process is more complex than base biology -i by the way don't consider myself special in this regard, i suspect all humanity is however the meme has stayed and it's that psychological pressure which still compels much of human herd behavior.  Nor i should add do i consider myself above or outside the herd, i am but flotsam in the tide and although mostly i think away from the groupthink i am very much part of the human algorithm - it's there that comes part of the problem, if humanity is coded could i not be a bug?  
  
Some errant data destined to do nothing but screwed up calculation, maybe i'm the sideward trajectory of a polygon which lies outside the bounds of vision so will never be rendered... If i think of the human herd i see myself trampled under it's feet, in non metaphorical terms the life i live and want to live is not possible in the world i live in.  I try, i do nothing but try, like peer gynt I was raised on tails of personal exceptionalism - i made plans and worked hard, I've not stopped slowly working towards my plans - i'm good a planning, each step forward carefully testing the ground but never hesitating, etc, etc, etc whatever i try however far i get some malevolent force fucks it all up - now i can't bring myself to start right at the fucking beginning *again* and work my balls off for every idiot and his stupid ideas to fuck it up.  Dozens of different attempts at living a moral and simple life have been ruined by fucktards, that's how life will always be i see it now - the stupid and immoral are safer to employ than clever, healthy and self-motivated free thinkers... fuck i can't even get a job at the post office because their psychometric testing (which i could write a dozen essays on why it's inherently flawed) detects that I'm not what they're *looking* for.  The world is basically broken, i also am broken in many ways - trying to smash two broken things together to fix one or the other just isn't going to work.  
  
I can't deal with shit talking sales people, i used to work in sales, i see through the bullshit and i simply can't lie to people like that anymore, i can't use the selling circle to close a deal, i can't use the embarrassment factor to stop cancellation of a bogus deal - i *could* but i wont, i can't.  The same as I can't lie to *please* a woman, if the world was full of women that didn't demand lies then that would be fine however alas thats not the world we live in, most don't demand lies but will willingly accept them, others want a good appearance of truth but it still has to be twisted right... I simply can't bring myself to be someone i'm not - I've never met a woman (or man, i'm not picky) who wants the person i am (although i've met plenty who thought they did) or any that i want or could be with.  
  
I'm rambling in and out of personal exceptionalism and common angst, i feel i'm in the grey area between the two - however rather than be in the lofty heights of metaphore i'm stuck here on the floor beneath the feet of the herd.    Reality is harsh, i struggle and yet I'm struggling towards nothing.  Sure i have my dreams, i want to add some literary truth to the world but what for? The most freethinking and freedom given philosophy can be twisted to support Nazi's or Imperialism...  For those like me? for us few who see enough to feel the suffering? if i am but a being of suffering then why create more? Let chaos and stupidity rule if only in that can ever good times be felt.  
  
I used to love parties, music festivals and the life - after working so long in the music industry i simply can't find anything thats not plastic wrapped fakery designed to massage social egos.  I have opened my eyes to the psychology of society too far and now all i see is suffering, I admit in this exceptionalist fantasy i can't end my life for i must continue and through hardship strive to make things better in some small way... it's in those dark moments when i can't see myself as anything but the trampled carrion which i wish for all the world i would die, i just see the inevitable negative existence my life is bound to be even in the unlikely event of a best case ending - in those times sometimes its hard so see that when i have my campervan on the road and a little money saved i'll be able to get away from at least most of the shit in my current world, then i might be able to start writing properly or just enjoying life... however when i can't even afford to do my bike test and it sits rusting in the garage it seems so far away paying for a driving test, finishing the van, saving money... if it hadn't been for fuckwit bankers the company i worked for would have paid and i'd be away now, if before that my boss hadn't stolen all the wages i'd have gone long ago, even longer if the company before that hadn't closed down and not paid..... i see an endless stream of hard work followed by disappointment and suffering.  Even when this little step is done its still only more problems into an inevitable end, the end i sometimes wish for so strongly.",1264701321,"chaucer, shakspear, hess, heinlein all must agree tragedy is beautiful but never pleasant -always will some horror befall an illfated protagonist...","beautiful but never","beautiful","but",FALSE,"beautiful but never pleasant","pleasant",NA,"never",1

"c0j40tk","well, where were we?

Again, I don't know if I am going to succeed in addressing each of your points, but it is probably worth saying a little about where I think these basic moral principles that I have proposed come from and what they are.

These foundation stones for a moral code that exist within the sum of humanity are indicators of value. They aren‚Äôt rules or instructions about what to do in themselves, and they have no particular authority except that given to them by humanity as a whole. You are right that I can‚Äôt claim to have deduced what they all are, but think we have some pretty good ideas. I think *contentedness* is a pretty widespread one. You like being content, I like it and we both inherently understand the nature of why Jane and Joe down the street like being content. *Beauty* is another good candidate. Different people certainly have different ideas of what is beautiful, but most us hold the idea of beauty as something that we can agree is good. As humans, we like beautiful things, whether they are sunsets or Ming dynasty vases or pleasingly symmetrical rock formations. There are a few other things that I am happy to think of as inherently having value in themselves, like *knowledge*, meaning an accurate understanding of the universe, and *self determination* meaning the right of individuals to do as they please.

I don‚Äôt think these values are universal in the sense that they exist outside the consciousness of people. I also don‚Äôt think they are universal in the sense that they exist in every human.  I certainly wouldn‚Äôt begin to say only sane people get to be in some group that decides these values. And I would definitely never say that only people with fully developed moral codes get to be in the group. Instead, the statement ‚Äúhumans value contentedness‚Äù is true in the same way that the statement ‚Äúreddit commenters are funny‚Äù is true. There are plenty of unfunny reddit commenters, but more than not, in the aggregate and on average and because of the fact that unfunny comments get deleted or downvoted or hidden more often, it is true. Similarly, plenty of individuals and even whole societies at once might reject some particular value without changing the fact that taken as a whole, humans seem to mostly like it.

Now, all these values are messy and mutually contradictory, but that is because the massed humans we are deriving these values from are a messy and mutually contradictory people. It would be great if we had some way to measure and compare these things precisely, so that we know exactly how much contentedness has to result in order to justify violating someone‚Äôs right to self-determination, but we don‚Äôt. (One punch in the nose debit is worth three lazy afternoon in the park credits, I think. Or should it be four?) Since no such system can really make sense, I just have to make the best estimate I can based on the information I have. Luckily, as a sceptic, I am used to making judgments on woefully incomplete information, so I just dive in and do the best I can.

And that, in a nutshell, is my moral code, no god necessary. I believe that our moral responsibility, should we wish to participate in humanity and have the human society respect us in turn as people, is to look clearly at the evidence available and make our honest and best predictions about the results of our actions. Then, having predicted, we must choose the available course of action that we think will result in the least harm and the most good, with good being defined as that which is useful in creating and sustaining the things we value, and harm as that which is destructive of them. The only thing that is immoral, in fact, is intentionally and consciously choosing to avoid the outcome that results in the most good.

All that my moral code demands is that you do that best you can within your capabilities. If you are emotionally incapable of pushing the fat man, fine, you are exonerated to the extent that you are incapable of acting, in the same way that a small child is not held responsible for the disastrous results of her actions if she is not capable of understanding their outcomes. If the option that results in the greatest good is one that you cannot perform, then it is not an available option. I think it is quite likely that I would not emotionally be up for the task of personally and directly causing the deaths of 100,000 people, especially if I had to do it with a pistol or something, but rationally I know what the right choice is.

I still don‚Äôt fully understand your god, who is happy to have you cause death with your choices as long as you don‚Äôt do it with your fingers, but I may have to reconcile myself to not knowing. Your god doesn‚Äôt seem to very much resemble anyone else‚Äôs anyway‚Ä¶ Your god seems to be kind of an amalgamation of a first cause and a universal structure, rather than the more personal loving father or tyrannical asshole of the classical texts, who might violate causality by giving people promotions or intervening in football games if someone asks nicely enough. 

Anyway, sorry about the line calling your views sick and malevolent, it doesn‚Äôt really seem like a very polite thing to say in retrospect. I was trying to get across the intensity of feeling I would have about someone who consciously chose the unnecessary deaths of at least 2,900,000 people.

Somewhat like yourself, I am inclined to give the benefit of the doubt to anyone who is trying hard to perfect and live by their moral code, as I am trying to perfect and live by mine.

"c0gfr2y","Yeah, exactly.  

HDR in photography is a great tool to expand the range of tones you can deal with.  The problem is that it's too often used as a clich√© ""look"" to give a scene ""punch"" through ridiculous saturation and flat tones.  When it's misused it's horrid; it makes a nice scene look like a game rendering.  If that's something which is photographically appropriate, great.  But often it's not; too much nature and landscape photography falls into this genre.  People want to make their landscapes look surreal and beautiful, but they end up making them look faked up and unnatural instead.

I haven't been much of a gamer lately, but I saw a trailer or gameplay demo recently with a game employing this game HDR.  It struck me as much more realistic; people were running through a dark canyon or something and whenever they'd turn a corner that would bring the sun into view they'd be temporarily blinded by its intensity.  This is a much more realistic behaviour.  

In photography it's good to have tools available to make *choices*.... you may want to shoot for realism, you may want to coax extra tones out of shadows or highlights, you might want high or low contrast.  HDR in photographic imaging frees you from some limitations of digital capture so that you can make your own *choices* instead of being forced by the limits of the medium.  But it's not necessarily realistic; in a game situation using what they call HDR in that arena gives added realism.  Different issues at play.

I agree with ""creativeembassy"" below you said calling it HDR-reduction in photography and HDR-simulation in video games would be good.  Or maybe HDR-capture for photography.

There is definitely a window in your life where you can just pick up and go do things like this, and once you get even a little bit older it becomes much, much more difficult.

A little general advice:

Most definitely do your research on any school you're considering before you leave.  Read up on them online and try to find testimonials from people who have worked there.  There are those that prey on young people who arrive and have no one to turn to.

"c0esrm4","&gt; I do think Scheme (and the whole Lisp-thing) is a beautiful language and a very interesting exercise, but in the end programming is about making programs, the one thing Scheme just isn't fit for

We've been hearing this for forty-some years: Lisp (and later Scheme) is an academic exercise, elegant and beautiful but inefficient and useless in the real world.  I think this is because the early Lisp implementations were inefficient interpreters, while the early Fortran and COBOL implementations (the only competition at the time) were optimizing compilers.  This is no longer true: [compiled Scheme code is comparable in efficiency to compiled Java or C++ code](http://www.flownet.com/gat/papers/lisp-java.pdf).

More important than run-time efficiency (as [that same paper](http://www.flownet.com/gat/papers/lisp-java.pdf) points out) is *programmer* efficiency, and Scheme programmers produce correct, working programs faster and more predictably than Java or C++ programmers do.  Studies of programmer productivity for decades have shown that a programmer produces roughly the same number of lines of working, debugged code per day, regardless of language.  So if you want to improve your productivity, switch to a language in which you can say more with fewer lines of code.

&gt; Scheme has little to do with how a computer actually works. While imperative languages translate into machine language more or less directly, step-by-step

This is true, but what does it mean?  Not that imperative languages are ""better"", but that they are more closely tied to a particular machine architecture.  For example, the prefix and postfix ++ and -- operators in C (and C++ and Java) are there because the PDP-11 and VAX-11 machine languages had a feature that made those operators easy to implement -- not because they were especially useful in solving problems.

If you want to design a language for solving problems, it should closely mirror how the *human mind* or the *problem at hand* works, not necessarily how the *computer* works.  OOP works for solving certain kinds of problems not because hardware easily supports classes, fields, polymorphism, etc. but because the human mind likes to categorize things into classes and subclasses of objects.  Similarly, functional programming works for solving certain kinds of problems not because it's well supported by hardware but because it closely mirrors some of the ways people think about the world.

&gt; Recursion is really fun, but it is usually (always?) more efficient to use non-recursive algorithms. And while they are less elegant, they are not less readable.

Others have already addressed this.  No, recursion is *not* necessarily less efficient, -- in particular, functional programs are much easier to adapt to massively-parallel computers -- and it *does* frequently make the solution much easier to read and understand.

&gt; Shouldn't we be graded on whether our code works or not? Who cares how I wrote and whether I tested it or not if it works? Some functions require testing, I test them. Some, like inch-&gt;meter, really don't.

I think even you would agree that ""readability"" is also an important criterion: if it seems to work, but nobody can understand why, nobody has total *confidence* that it works, and nobody dares to make any modifications to it, that's not a good program.

You're right, ""inch-&gt;meter"" isn't a complicated-enough function to need much testing.  But did you ever see ""The Karate Kid""?  The kid wants to learn karate; his *sensei* assigns him to wax the floor, and paint the wall, and so on, correcting his posture throughout.  He is of course terribly impatient with all this, as he's not learning karate.  Then the *sensei* throws a blow at him, and he blocks it with ""wax-the-floor"" motion; another blow, and he blocks it with ""paint-the-wall"" motion, both of which have become habits.  Writing contracts and test cases for ""inch-&gt;meter"" is building habits that you'll use when writing real, difficult functions.

And the notion of ""writing lots of test cases before you write code"" is far from unique to Scheme, your school, or the [How to Design Programs](http://www.htdp.org) textbook; do a Google search on ""test driven development"".

&gt; My father thinks that if many universities do it, it must be a good choice. What does Reddit think?

Complete and utter bunk.  Many universities use Java or C++ as a first language, not because they are good first programming languages but because of historical inertia.  And I wouldn't ask you to believe that Scheme, either, is a good first language just because a number of respected universities use it.  Instead, look at how it affects your thinking about programs.",1256235464,"&gt; i do think scheme (and the whole lisp-thing) is a beautiful language and a very interesting exercise, but in the end programming is about making programs, the one thing scheme just isn't fit for  we've been hearing this for forty-some years: lisp (and later scheme) is an academic exercise, elegant and beautiful but inefficient and useless in the real world.","elegant and beautiful","beautiful",NA,FALSE,"beautiful but inefficient","inefficient",NA,NA,1

&gt;Hope may be slim and beautiful, but she is no weak thing‚Ä¶[Barack] proved it again when all of Washington, D.C., wondered what this skinny kid with the funny name could offer a nation in need. But the hope that lived in Barack burned bright, and on the night he became a senator, everybody felt the flame.

&gt;One sun-drenched day, as his wife Michelle stood by, Barack smiled on a sea of faces from Wichita to Waikiki. He saw whites and blacks, rich and poor, Christians and Muslims and Jews; he saw the ghosts of his parents, of Gramps and Toot, of Martin Luther King, Jr. and JFK. And on that special day Barack was the bridge that held them all together. ‚ÄúI want to be your president,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúCan we make America better? Can we work together, as one?‚Äù With a single voice the crowd called out, ‚ÄúYes! We can!‚Äù

Imagine if that was talking about Bush, would you still think it appropriate?

"c0cmmwd","I've been fighting with depression on and off for about 10 years, and have been mildly depressed for the past three to four years. I figure I'll offer a different viewpoint than what others have said (these are just my own opinions and views):

First I want to get this out there: He sounds depressed, and it is 99% likely that it *not* anything you did. Whenever I'm down, I don't really want to talk about it with my fiance, for a number of reasons. Him apologizing for bringing it up and then not wanting to talk about it sounds exactly like something I would do. Take that as you will. The problem is: he won't open up if he's not ready and trying to force it will absolutely ***not*** make the situation any better for him. Unfortunately, you're just going to have to be patient.

Next: Everyone mentions sex. I know that it makes you feel better and gets you motivated and happy and releases endorphins and blah blah blah. These things are great *temporary* mood boosters. After the endorphins wear off, you're still depressed though. And good luck trying to get your boyfriend interested in sex if he's depressed. Last night my fiance offered me a blowjob if I'd take a quick shower (I'd been sweating outside all day). I couldn't even summon up the motivation to shower, knowing all I would have to do was lay there while she sucked me off (she swallows by the way).

Food is the same way. My fiance is a fantastic cook, and she'll cook me anything I'd ever ask. It's not an issue of getting good food and good sex. Food literally does not taste as good as it used to. Sure, I can tell when she's cooked something well and when it tastes good, but it's just not as enjoyable. It's like editing a photo and turning the saturation down so that you can barely notice color. Sure you can still see the colors you like, but they're dull and plain and lackluster. You know that you've seen the same image when it was bright and colorful and beautiful, but you can't see it that way now.

Depression isn't something you can just cook or suck out of him. It is a long and hard process. If he doesn't want to open up or talk about, or do anything, you can't force him. The best possible thing you can do for him is to be there for him, and to *listen* to him when he is ready to open up. Listening is so important. Even if you disagree with him when he says ""everyone is a selfish asshole, no one cares about anyone else, there is no justice,"" agree with him. Sometimes he'll just need a dump of his problems: Just sit there and let him get it all out when he needs to.

I'm not sure about your boyfriend or others, but for me in my family, showing any kind of psychological problem was considered one of the worst weaknesses and greatest offenses against the family I could do. Let him know that if he wants to get or avoid help, you'll support his decision. If he's looking for help, find him a list of doctors you think might fight him well and make his choice (and work) easier to do. Offer to call the doctors to set up appointments if he wants to see one.

Let him know that it is *okay* that he is depressed.

Don't do that, please. It hurts. Let him know that it's alright that he's not functioning at 100% and that *it isn't his fault*.

The best thing you can do for him is to be there for him. I've been on the other side of the coin, dating depressed women, and I know how easy it is for you to think that it's your fault. Don't. It's most likely nothing you did, even though it feels like it. Having been there for the depressed one and been depressed, I think you have the much harder job. It's so difficult being there for someone day in and day out when they're depressed and there's nothing you can do about it. Make sure you stay strong while you're being there for him, or it could really end up making you feel worthless.

"c0cm9br","&gt;""Women are beautiful, men are ugly""

I disagree completely, and I'm sure I'll get down voted for this, but here goes.

Look at other animal species, the males of many species have ""sex ornaments"" that make them more beautiful and able to attract females.  Ex: Lions, Peacocks (other birds as well), most deer-like species, certain species of insects.  The females are usually very dull in color and general form.  

I believe it is the same with humans.  Women require so much work to actually look pretty, while men can basically throw on some decent clothes and either shave or not shave, fix their hair up a bit, and look great.  The female body, while beautiful, is not defined and muscular like the males body is.  Why is it that people like Michelangelo chose the male form to sculpt, rather than the female form?  Why is it that the male form is almost always sculpted or depicted by artists while the female form is less commonly depicted by artists?  I believe it is because the male form is more aesthetically pleasing.

Don't take this the wrong way, I'm still attracted to females, and I still find them beautiful.  But I've also seen them in the morning with no make-up, and it's a big letdown to realize that the girl you just fucked looks like shit without make-up.

1: bring plenty of storage and batteries.

2: Remember that the wedding is about the bride, her bridesmaids, her parents, and the guy she just hooked. Everyone else is a guest. So make sure that the bride can look back in exactly one year and remember her special day by seeing herself and all of her friends having fun. Also try to get pics of the groomsmen having fun so the groom doesn't feel cheated.

2-a: Find out if anyone in the family is exceedingly old or has one foot in the grave and make sure that you get pics of that person having fun before they croak.

3: Get a helper. Why? Because when you're shooting the wedding your helper is in the reception area shooting a beautiful, but empty room. Get detail shots like flowers and table settings. If it's a good set of photos you can also sell them to the floral company/decorator. Also, during the reception you can tag-team the dance floor while the other shoots the tables.

4: You may have to re-stage key moments from the ceremony after the fact: like the kiss.

"c0bdig3","Not to be a killjoy, but to provide a counter point here,...really,....DDO, really?
Forgive the long rant, but the game makes me sad because it comes close to being good/fun, but only succeeds in being momentarily amusing.
I played the original beta, and out of curiosity stayed on for 2 months when it went live before dying of boredom with 3 maxed out characters (10th level at the time). I've returned for the beta, but after hitting 14th level in a week, I find very little has changed, despite the addition of sparse new content, the same stale taste is left in my mouth and I uninstalled before beta even ended.
I'll try &amp; give it a little love while pointing out the annoyances, &amp; note that the game 'can' be fun. 

1) The graphics and settings are beautiful, but almost identical to LotRO, another Turbine game. 

2) To point out a misleading statement in the OP, most content is NOT mostly available for free. The majority of the good classes/races/dungeons/areas/conveniences must be purchased or unlocked with favor points. Anyone starting out F2P will have very limited options to gain (alot of required)faction or xp because of this. 

3) The combat system is refreshing for an online game in that there is no target/autoattack option (even though they havent removed the old autoattack button-you can activate it but nothing happens). You have to mouse click (no remapping the button) to attack each swing (or hold mouse1&amp;2 to continuously swing). Anything in your arc takes damage (similar to Conan-although DDO had it first). 

4) There is no innate hp/mana regen inside dungeon areas,...period, which I fully enjoy because of the challenge, but makes playing with WoWheads who want to charge everything in reckless abandon a nightmare for healers/casters who only have X spellpoints per rest period. Single use Rest/Ressurection shrines are scattered sparsely through dungeons and further limited by the difficulty setting (solo/norm/hard/elite) upon entering the instance. 

5) VoiP is built in and functional, but unnerving to adults when you hear your main tank is under 13 &amp; whining like a baby for heals and buffs when you have a fixed amount of spellpoints (see above). 

6) All the power of good character build comes from your feats and timely cross-class selection (ie. rogue at 1st level for the skillpoints if you only want the rogue skills but not the rogue). As there is no reset to your character, a newb will often find theyve borked or missed out on essential feats/classes/spells by the time they reach 5-8th level &amp; have to reroll. 

7) Favor (faction) requirements for good classes/races/dungeons/areas/conveniences are pretty steep, requiring you to re-run dungeons frequently which becomes monotonous. 

8) Everything is instanced centered around a few instanced city blocks. Like it or hate it, it reminds me of GuildWars and robs the game world of a feeling of persistance. 

9) PvP is pretty much non-existant although added as an after thought, restricted to in tavern brawl-fests with no intended balance or purpose. 

10) The LFG function is great! Search/Join/Create groups easily &amp; effortlessly,...unfortunately, most people won't or don't join pickup groups because there is such disparity between player knowledge, equipment and skills (Borked fighter who wont use a shield LFG,...anyone,...). 

11) Gear is severly limited. On the plus side, the game is very forgiving to the under equiped until you hit about 8th level. Although there is an awful lot of variation, everyone will have +5 everythings whenever they can use it(level reqs), if they want it. And speaking of gear the elemental burst weaps that everyone wants, that add 2d6 damage to all hits are severly unbalanced in gameplay at lower-mid levels. 

12) Mob AI is severly retarded. Rubberbanding is mad,...take one step towards mob,...mob takes one step towards you,...mob ends up behind you,...you swing at air,...33% of the time a mob will just stand there beside you doing nothing trying to determine your location, or lob missles 50m left or right of you, as you hack through his allies and proceed to hew it in two. 

13) Traps are plentiful, but all have the same single hidden control box interface to succeed or fail at. Once you know the locations in an instance they never change. It can be frustrating having the fighter or cleric point out where all the trap locs are to an inexperienced rogue, waiting for them to find &amp; disable them(or fail) right where you said they'd be. Locked Doors, Locked Chests, Secret Doors similarly are plentiful, but all can leave you with incomplete instances without the proper class/skills/stats/spells in your party. 

14) Although alignment is part of your character creation, it has little ingame function other than class restrictions. 

15) The community seems to have gotten even younger if that's possible. Good or bad, it is what it is. 

16) There really isn't much else to do in-game other than run the same instances over &amp; over, reroll another toon or accumulate more money than you could ever spend on anything ingame. Most games these days MMOs offer many other gameplay options such as mini-games, collections or acheivements, a semi-meaningful crafting system, or simply social gathering areas to wow the newbs with your leet gear. DDO has none of these.

Atari/Turbine shouldn't have been given the IP for a game that only vaguely resembles D&amp;D imo. D&amp;D should be such an open-ended, player-empowered, unrestricted experience imo. It's not like the game mechanics (consequential alignment/persistant world/climbing walls/meaningful crafting system/domicile building/class guilds/racial areas) for a true D&amp;D-esque game don't exist in other games,...Turbine just wanted to create a lowest common denominator appealing romp, the point of which seems to be to run a well known instance 'perfectly'. This game feels like a very small sandbox with very few toys in it(which some people are looking for in their gaming world I guess).

"c0az0x2","The article strikes me as fairly obvious, from a mathematicians standpoint.

Mathematical models of economics _must_ depend on two factors:

1. The actors must be perfectly rational actors; and,
2. All variables must, in theory, be quantifiably definable.

But Economics involves the complex interaction of thousands of different variables, not all of their respective contributions can be accurately accounted for.  Obviously we then take the step of ignoring some variables, or assuming they stay constant.  Unfortunately this often yields models that can be rather far off the mark.

And then these models are applied to humans who are most certainly _not_ perfectly rational creatures, and the whole damn edifice can fall apart.

The only solution is the integration of certain non-quantifiable kinds of data into the models (most famously, ""expectations), which we force into quasi-quantifiable number schemes.  This is all well and good if the model turns out to ""accurately"" reflect reality, but it is most certainly not purely mathematical in nature anymore.

Mathematics is incredibly powerful, elegant, and beautiful; but by its very design it acts on universal and eternal truths that increase in perfection as they decrease in tangibility.  The interior angles of drawn triangle _never_ sum to 180 degrees.  The very application of reality to the mathematics perverts them.

Well now this would get us into my personal views and that's a whole 'nother story.

I believe that life is not sacred yet at the same time it is wonderful and beautiful but in the end, when the God's are forgotten and the centuries old morality hits the fan, Life is ruthless and morbid.  Some things can't be decided using our ancient morality and our need to cling to control over others.  Life makes its own rules and acts arbitrarily and with little empathy.

I also believe that I can't tell other (EVER) what to do with their bodies.

I work closely as and with activists in LA fighting for more rights for MedicalMJ users and the same deal applies: please don't try to tell me what to do with my body..*even when some lifeform I created is at stake and even when my own life is at stake.*

I am able to live with this contradiction because I also believe that us humans are really directly connected to the power of the Universe and that no God stands between us and this power.

Who am I to tell a fellow God what to do with their own creation?

"c09u7sv","Ok, so I've been bitching and bitching about games not being fun anymore lately and about the industry being in a downturn.  Well, last weekend I got ""Demon's Souls"" (DS from now on) that I imported (which supposedly will arrive to the USA in the fall).  And weird thing is, I didn't even know about this game!  A fellow redditor gave me a tip!  WOW!  Was I blow the hell away when I started playing this!  Sheeeeiiiittt...

DS is a flawless mix of action and RPG.  Two of my favorite genres together mixed in a way that is so organic and so perfect, that I really hope this becomes a new genre from now on.  I hope more games follow in the Action RPG (ARPG) genre!  It's too good to miss out.

Take the difficulty level and sheer and utter coolness factor of Ninja Gaiden, add the relentless and unforgiving action of Devil May Cry, add a unique and well tuned and sophisticated RPG stat system that is especially geared toward the action, make the game if not as big as World of Warcraft, then it sure seems that way, put in bosses that look so uber and that attack so ferociously, that you'll pee in your pants before you learn how to beat them...and you get Demon's Souls!

The art in Demon's Souls is breathtaking.  This game has arguable the best looking dragons and landscapes I've seen, ever, in any game, and the dragons are possibly the best even if you compare them to movies.  There are a lot of cool creatures in this game, and I am not a huge fan of dragons, but for some reason I really got impressed by their amazing good looks, well conveyed power that is earth-shaking and heat spewing.

The size of the game is insane.  I sunk about 30 hours into it, playing non-stop over the long week-end.  I played the Asian version.  It has all the English titles and voices!  The English is not perfect, but it is serviceable.  Due to bad English I did miss a few things, like the magic trainers, so I will have to start over from scratch, but it's fun and I am looking forward to starting over!  I am not thinking, ""Crap, not again!""  I am thinking, ""Wow, when I start over, I will try this and this and that, etc.""

The land mass is huge.  But some other things add to replayability.  First, very high level of challenge.  The only other game that made me die as much was Ninja Gaiden.  If you don't like challenge, this game may not be for you.  But if you like challenge, this is your game right here.  Second, the game adds extra features on second and further play-throughs.  Some very cool items and monsters and other features are only unlocked on at least a second play-through.  But to really beat the game 100% it looks like you may need to beat it 4 times or so.  I sank 30 hours in it, and I barely scratched the surface!  I explored about 40% of the game.  I am not the fastest player.  I like to take my time and I am not the best at action gaming, although I would call myself competent.  I am not uber, but not terribly bad either.  So if you are uber, you might go faster, but if not, you might also go much slower, as you'll need to rely less on skill and more on levels to make up the difference.  I've reached level 41 out of total possible 700+ levels!  Think about that for a second.  Even if you're a much better player than me, there is a LOT of meat in this game no matter how you slice it.  And finally, there is a really nifty cooperative and PVP multi-player component to it.  I've tried some cooperative gaming, and it was fun, but in PVP I got invaded by some uber black phantom player who killed me in one hit, so I can't say if it was fun or not.  Most likely I did something stupid because I got backstabbed with a dagger, and they do insane damage in a backstab, so I had no chance.  When I got a message that my world was invaded, I didn't know what to expect...then I realized what it was after I died.  LOL

The game forces you to make some decisions.  There are limited equipment slots and for some of them, like for the two ring slots, there are many good rings to wear, but obviously you can only wear two.  There are many good weapons, but you don't have enough materials to upgrade all of them to the highest level.  There are common and precious upgrade materials.  The ones sold by the vendors are common, and you can upgrade using those to your heart's content.  However, some upgrade materials are limited/rare, and you best save them to make sure you upgrade something cool and not some piece of junk (like I did, LOL).

Make sure you get the Ring of Clinging and Thief's Ring, or you'll be sorry.  There are many good rings besides those, but the game is much harder without these two rings.  Both of those rings are found in the first world, so if you don't have them relatively soon, you're doing it wrong.  I played for 30 hours without getting the Thief's Ring.  Don't be like me.  I don't feel too bad though, because I read online some people missed the Ring of Clinging, which is easier to find -- how dumb is that?  This goes to show you, no matter how dumb you are, someone out there is dumber than you.

Another thing that I love about this game is that it's JAM-PACKED with secrets.  I love secrets.  There are lots of hidden areas and hidden items.  If you like exploring, this game is great.  Not only is it massive and beautiful, but it has so many secret areas which are fun to look for.  There are lots of traps and ambushes in the game, so you'll probably die many times looking for secret areas.

Another thing that amazed me, is that in one of the worlds, the setting is creepy.  This game is not meant to be a horror survival genre, but it creeped me out worse than Silent Hill in that one creepy area.  That's amazing!  The only game that was creepier to me was Fatal Frame (and Resident Evil is like a Christmas party, it hasn't been creepy in ages).

So in order for you to enjoy the game to the fullest, be aware that after you beat the first boss, magic and miracle trainers appear in the Nexus!  Don't forget this.  Those trainers are not obvious, because they are behind the stone columns in the center-bottom part of the Nexus.  So look behind the columns on the left and right side of the Nexus.

Another thing that is not obvious: DO NOT use the Demon Souls you get from beating the bosses.  Leave those souls in your inventory.  They weigh 0, so it's no problem.  You can exchange many/most of those souls for cool magic and items!  That's another thing I did wrong.  Due to poor English translation and due to the fact that the magic and miracle trainers are hidden behind the columns, I just used all the demon soul's on myself.  Bad mistake!  You can get plenty of souls in this game from fighting regular baddies.  Don't use the Demon Soul's on yourself unless no one offers anything for it.

Also, look for the second blacksmith.  The second blacksmith is in the first part of the second world.  Don't miss it.  Finding the second blacksmith is essential.

So, in conclusion, this game gets A+ or 10/10 in every category.  I even liked the voice acting.  Since this is an action game, voice acting doesn't play a major role in game play, so I am keeping that in mind when rating it.  If this was a game with a deep story, I would be pickier.  But this game's story, while by no means bad, is really there just to drive the game's action/strategy/tactical elements.

Also, keep in mind, if you want to summon other players, you must be in the corporeal form.  If you want to be summoned by others, you must be in soul form.  If you get invaded by the black phantom players -- be careful, but you'll probably die anyway, unless you're a pro.  You can die in a single hit, easily.  So it all comes down on who gets the drop first, who is the sneakiest, etc.  It's not a run-n-gun type game.  If you get parried, it's game over too.  It's kind of like sword fighting in real life.  In the first 10 seconds one of the guys is dead or maimed.  It's not a drawn out affair.  The only way I can think of to last long in a due is to keep your distance and have a bow fight.  Even then you better hope those bows haven't been upgraded much and that you've farmed plenty of high level grass, and that you have your own weapons/bows upgraded to finish the battle.

But if you worry about PVP, I suggest you don't.  I only got invaded once.  There aren't that many players playing PVP, at least right now.  It's more common to play cooperatively.

There is only one thing I don't like in the game.  And it's so minor that it doesn't affect my score.  The rag doll physics of the dead bodies is bad.  The bodies get flung too easily.  I understand that the game designers don't want the masses of bodies slow down the movement, that's fine.  But it looks ridiculous to see the dead body get flung 10 meters to the side or into the air by just running through it!  I doubt this will get fixed in the USA release, but if this was fixed, the game would be arguably without flaws, assuming the translations improve.

I think this game is perfect as-is.  If you want to import this game, it's a good one to import today!  Compare the prices, because some import stores overcharge like crazy.  I got mine from play-asia.com and I am very happy with it.  They shipped on the same day, and the game arrived all the way from Hong Kong much faster than I expected.",1243378587,"not only is it massive and beautiful, but it has so many secret areas which are fun to look for.","massive and beautiful","beautiful",NA,FALSE,"massive and beautiful","massive",NA,NA,0

We all want to help one another. Human beings are like that. We want to live by each other's happiness, not by each other's misery. We don't want to hate and despise one another.

Machinery that gives abundance has left us in want. Our knowledge as made us cynical; our cleverness, hard and unkind. We think too much and feel too little. More than machinery, we need humanity. More than cleverness, we need kindness and gentleness. Without these qualities, life will be violent and all will be lost. The airplane and the radio have brought us closer together. The very nature of these inventions cries out for the goodness in men; cries out for universal brotherhood; for the unity of us all. Even now my voice is reaching millions throughout the world, millions of despairing men, women, and little children, victims of a system that makes men torture and imprison innocent people. To those who can hear me, I say, do not despair. The misery that is now upon us is but the passing of greed, the bitterness of men who fear the way of human progress. The hate of men will pass, and dictators die, and the power they took from the people will return to the people. And so long as men die, liberty will never perish. Soldiers!

As far as anyone knows, this is the one life you get.  Anyone that says they KNOW an afterlife exists is lying or god himself.  I think we can agree on that much...

Things that are scarce have value, and since my time here on earth is undetermined and very limited that makes me value the time I spend here very much.  As an aside-although an eternal life seems tempting to a mortal, at a deeper level I would find it boring and unfulfilling.  I don't mean to debate you on the existence of an afterlife here, but note that if an infinite afterlife is meaningless to me, than a limited one is definitely meaningful.  That doesn't mean that I want to lose all the time I do have here, but the idea that someday my life will end gives the time that I do spend a value to me.  I can't tell anyone else how to value their life-it would be like me trying to get you to value hockey or gay sex or animal crackers.  All that matters is that it matters to me (life and animal crackers, that is ;) )

I love to love, help others (I work in the health care field), I have great family and friends and enjoy all the things out of life that you enjoy on a day to day.  I love to debate and have meaningful conversations and I'm avidly looking for truth and the objective nature of the world we live in, wherever the evidence leads me.

Sure thing kid.

&gt;Offer a mother a free private education or a public school education---say she's from Prince George's County; Roxbury, MA; or Bed-Stuy, Brooklyn; and what would she choose? The issue is more choice than anything else though, but for the purpose of this I think it's fair to claim that many public school are lacking compared to private schools in their area.

Where a parent wants to send his or her kid/s is not relevant to quality of education. You stick the same 35 kids from a public school classroom into a private school classroom and you will have similar results at greater expense.

I didn't bring up police at this point. How can we know what private fire departments have done? Look to our countries history, look to world history. They want you to pay upfront for services rendered. 

As for Xe, I had a feeling you'd bring that up, they get used because they don't ever have to answer for what they do. The US military on the other hand does have to.

&gt;Ya PBS has no commercials because it's freakin' subsidized. I have no problem with commercials. These TV networks are not making huge margins.

&gt;Plus, lower cost? Relative term. WGBH just build a beautiful but huge studio/offices in Boston. They're now in some deep debts/liabilities:

&gt;http://www.boston.com/ae/media/articles/2009/04/04/wgbh_to_cut_costs_as_budget_gap_hits_3m/

Yes, lower costs. Public broadcasting runs on smaller budgets and still manages to pull off some of the best news options around, some of the best children's programing around and so on. I can listen to NPR pretty much across the country and still their operating costs are lower per unit.

&gt;I see where you're going with this but will indulge:

&gt;I hate tolls because states should be using the state income tax on roads in the first place instead of silly social programs. These tolls are a regressive tax for the most part and creates an additional cost on business which is passed on to the consumer. It's another burden for the poor and middle class to bear and indirectly creates the demand for the silly social programs.

Apparently you don't see where I was going with it. Privately provided roads would necessitate paying tolls. You can pay $5 to use that road, $3 to use that road, $2 to use the road that leads to your house. Publicly operated road infrastructure operates at a lower cost than it would in private hands and with less intrusion to either of our lives than it would if it were in private hands.

&gt;Would a few bad eggs try to arrest more criminals on questionable crimes? Of course. Are a few bad eggs now NOT arresting people for actual crimes because they have cozy job security? Of course. But, I clearly said that the police force and fire department should be publicly run. No libertarian advocates for privatizing this.

So yet another example you concede on. Good.

&gt;Again, I never arguing for the privatization of this.

&gt;States and cities and towns are better off with limited social programs and creating a strong public school system based on choice.

You asked for a public system that is cheaper than if a private sector ran it. I named many.

"c08o0hu","&gt;Either way, you asked for one example, I provided several.

No. You provided examples that were wrong.

&gt;Private schools perform about equal and that tends to be when private schools have fewer students per classroom. For an increased cost per student you get a similar result as a lower cost per student.

Offer a mother a free private education or a public school education---say she's from Prince George's County; Roxbury, MA; or Bed-Stuy, Brooklyn; and what would she choose? The issue is more choice than anything else though, but for the purpose of this I think it's fair to claim that many public school are lacking compared to private schools in their area.

&gt;There are private fire fighting outfits out there though usually he operate under state or federal auspice and funding for wild land firefighters. Otherwise history has a few good examples of private fire departments doing some pretty heinous things and many many more examples of fire departments, many of which are staffed by volunteers, that do superb jobs.

Again, I said my fire/police talk was conjecture as how can we know since it's all public and is the only game in town, so to speak. We can look no further than Iraq though. Say what you will about Blackwater, or XE or whatever it's called now, but there's a reason why VIPs used them to help transport and secure areas. Now, I guarantee you'll come back with Blackwater's ""heinous crimes.""

Um, every freakin' day an overzealous cop makes #1 on reddit committing an ""heinous crime"" usually encroaching on civil liberties, thugging on pot smokers, or tasing someone.

&gt;PBS operates at lower costs than bigger networks and it relies on public funding. Meanwhile the shows you like watching have increasingly less show and increasingly more commercial.

Ya PBS has no commercials because it's freakin' subsidized. I have no problem with commercials. These TV networks are not making huge margins.

&gt;Tell me, how would you feel about paying tolls everytime you drove on any road? How would you feel about a police station that was paid more money based on a number of convictions per officer? How would you feed about a judicial system that rewarded judges for convictions?

"c07i0mu","Enterprises will have some strategic mistakes easy to ignore during the process of launching network marketing, while carrying on the marketing strategy of the network, following several question should arouse attention.  

The first mistake is that the network marketing taking products as the centre popularizes the tactics. Stress that emphasizes the meaning of the products, and totally ignore and should regard customer as the centre in fact. This is a theory that is often mentioned in traditional marketing, it's a pity that has not noticed this question yet in much network marketing. Because Internet is a kind of special media easy to be interdynamic, some diminishes and has a look around the advertisement (for example spring the window) that is experienced ,Will impel viewers to be repugnant. If this kind of situation appears on the newspaper, even everybody feels laughable or angry, put on one side at most. But on Internet, they know the shouts of cursing. This kind of one that may produce comments negatively that lets the ad owner have a lingering fear, fear this kind of means of network marketing to some extent, in any case, make advertisement excessive too to lead to the fact all.  

The second general mistake is excessive advancement of emphasizing technology and form of expression. An enterprise producing suit, its whole official website loads in one Flash, the layout is certainly very beautiful, but very regrettable, the search engine is unable to discern the cartoon, then have home only to the searching for amount of webpage of websites in the search engine. Nearly become today of a lot of net users' acquiescence home in the search engine, it is in fact useless to treat the search engine like this. After the designer's meticulous design level after leaders organizing have seen, appreciate very much, it's a pity to forget, the patience of the network viewer has only several seconds, and this exquisite Flash takes half a minute more than time can be finished loading.  

Another behavior is the application of the color. Nearly all people know, represent "" coolly "" black ,Some websites stress websites with black background ""  Cool "" Composition. But the scientific result of study indicates, black is unfavorable to reading for the page of the background. If one faces the mispronounced character of black bottom, within relative very short time, will feel visual fatigue. As the viewer praises one sentence "", this page is very cool. "" Then leave away after several seconds, does not know such website design besides taking a artistic expression Grand Prix, what meanings on marketing are there?  

If two strategic mistakes in the above are more plain, if the people who have general knowledge of a network technology slightly will do the best to avoid, then, the next mistake is whether a lot of people or thinking unconsciously repeating constantly correctly, regard sale as the centre excessively.  

I mention, accomplish network marketing the case of ultimate attainment was Dell's official website once. But what I mentioned too is, the websites of not all enterprises, can all make into Dell like that. Dell's network marketing, abundant value chain of establishing one's own system is managed, and all nearly standardized products of accessories price. And most enterprises, these two points do not possess.  

The correct thing will be done in correct time, as to a lot of organizations, one's own condition has determined, their network marketing plan should not be made into "" persuade and buy strongly "" (for example, make a simple B2C website) ,Should overweight based on customer collecting information feedback, realizing package solutioning of purchase decision of briefing on etc. even more.  

The last strategic question, can't say to pour it is a mistake, should say it is a condition. The network marketing links organized need a piece of firmness but the farsighted one be able to influence CEO of decision. Certainly not lack that kind of popularization case becoming effective in network marketing rapidly, but under most situations, it needs a long accumulation course.

"bdl7","Hm. This could actually be really fun if you pour it into a MMOG setting and make the controls really arcade-ish (read: easy to play, not requiring a pilots license).

Imagine that, a big and beautiful but alternative, futuristic world. There are 2 factions fighting it out. You start as a trainee and - depending on your class - you have a specific goal.

Solo play allows you to gain ""experience points"" (XP from now on) through solo missions (bombing small targets, getting rid of small threats around friendly bases).

Group play involves having a bigger mission that has better defenses and also offenses. You need a ""tank"" class airplane to distract the defenses while your ""DPS"" classes (air to ground attack, large area attacks) take care of said defenses, while your ""casters"" (air to air fighters, precision bombers) take care of enemy airplanes. Meanwhile, your ""healers"" (refueling airplanes that are slow, but very well defended) keep the group going.

In bigger raids you could have instanced areas where the mission objective is to destroy other packs of airplanes, but one of the airplanes in that squadron is a ""boss"" type, experimental airplanes to to speak. These have huge hitpoints (armor), great offense (firepower) and might even split up into multiple aircraft when damaged beyond a certain point.

""Loot"" will be upgrades you discover (you see the enemy do something) and basic upgrades at your home base, which only costs you a certain amount of experience.

PvP fighting will occur throughout the world. You'll be alarmed well ahead of time if you have radar, but might miss something if the enemy has stealth (the rogue class), stealth airplanes are fragile but can attack without prior notice.

A huge world will be required, so that people can simply fly around on autopilot, enjoy scenery and chat with online friends.

Fun factors include: upgrading your airplane(s) while grounded, tinkering with settings, modifying your airplane's looks through painting it, texturizing it, et cetera.

But instead of air to air defense (for when you get attacked) you can also mount ground defenses, turrets, air to air missile stations, and blast enemies out of the sky from a safe spot.

Additionally, while casually flying around, you are able to receive random radio requests from NPC's on the ground that are requesting help in fighting off something. This could be a bigass dinosaur, or flying saucers, or bandits or even a large swarm of bugs that infested a crop field. Farmers might radio in to ask you to create a crop circle for them to impress their neighbors. While doing this, you build up reputation, which can be used for unique upgrades and abilities.

"c06l3iy","Their cultural contents can be a problem, but it would be too long to discuss here and without much value. Esperanto is not just one more language, is a language that is much easier to learn and that works much better than most of them.

It happens quite often that a group of human beings that are doing things differently get together and create a new way of doing it, that is better and common. The only thing that is stopping Esperanto is the skepticism of people and the fact that people hate Esperanto only because their parents, friends, neighbors do it. I know because I was part of that group.

If you are going to learn English, because it is indeed a very useful language to know, you can learn Esperanto for one year and the English for three, and you'll speak better English than if you spent all four years learning English. So even if **Esperanto** didn't have any communication value, with which I would disagree, it **has a [propaedeutic value](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propaedeutic_value_of_Esperanto)**. So if you are very selfish, and only care about yourself and your chances of succeeding in this world, and need to learn another language for doing it, **learning Esperanto first is the most profitable way to go**.

English is not simple enough. It takes way too long to learn. I gave up on being a proficient English speaker, after 15 years I've realized it is just not possible. It could have less verb tenses, Esperanto has less. English has a huge list of irregular verbs that you have to learn by heart. It has phrasal verbs that are very problematic because they give you the understanding-all-words-but-not-the-sentence problem. The pronunciation is bad enough that after using it for almost two years non stop daily at work I can't speak without stopping myself to correct my pronunciation, and that kills how my ideas spread.

Learning Esperanto wouldn't allow you to speak with 127 million Japanese, but it would with some. If you are really in the group of people that don't learn Esperanto because it is not massive enough, then it would make sense for you to participate the [I will learn Esperanto but only if 1000, 10000, 100000, 1000000, 20000000 people learn it pledges](http://pupeno.com/blog/i-will-learn-esperanto-but-only-if..).

    In can rain all day long for 50 days in a row, yet when the sun does shine, the views of Mauna Loa and Mauna Kea from the Lilioukalani Gardens, or of Hilo Bay as you drive down from the mountains on Kaumana Drive, or the rain-forest and waterfall choked gulches leading to lovely small beaches along the highway north of town, make Hilo one of the most truly achingly lovely spots on earth.

Having long since lost the war of social vigor, the battle for tourists and the struggle for attracting new residents and industry to Hawai‚Äôi‚Äôs newer, cleaner, harder-working and much sunnier West Side, Hilo seems content to sit back on her laurels as the once-prosperous center of the sugar industry in an era long gone by, haughtily dictating policy and politics to the rest of the island.
    But even in her dissipation and decay, Hilo is lovely, interesting and intriguing. Like a courtesan in her declining years, who, having squandered her riches and forced to live off the charity of her wealthier relations, Hilo is still presentable, but far more notable for her raucous, and slightly ribald, tales of past glory.

"c0642qn","Disclosure: I've lived in Vancouver, Victoria, Toronto, and Montreal, and gone to UVic, U of T, and McGill, and worked at UBC.

Waterloo, Ontario is a total dump to live in if you're a city person.  Toronto can actually be really great in spite of what people say about it (the poor man's NYC), but be warned that U of T is an incredibly big school.  York U. is kind of in the suburbs.

Vancouver is really beautiful but kind of capitalistic and shallow and actually lacking in culture compared to Toronto and Montreal.  UBC is a great school and SFU is also good for certain things, like getting huge thighs by biking to school.  UVic is actually a really nice, quiet school to do an undergrad if you're into the whole West Coast, small-ish city kind of thing, but personally, I wouldn't want to live in Victoria for more than four years in a row.

Montreal is an amazing city but, even moreso than Toronto, it's cold as balls in the winter (which you might not mind) and it's hard to land a good job there while you're going to school unless you speak French.  McGill is a great school even though a lot of the undergrads are spoiled American brats (no offense).  Concordia is a bit lacking in academics but has a great culture from what I can tell.  

U of A will throw money at you if you're going to grad school, and I think it's probably a pretty good school.  Calgary is boring as hell but if you're into winter sports it's really close to the mountains.

By the way, ""my schoolmate went to X and is now teaching at Y"" is the kind of statement you should absolutely ignore.  There are dedicated, talented people at every school, and the best end up wherever they want, if they play their cards right.

I'm sorry, but I don't want to be an Emperor - that's not my business. I don't want to rule or conquer anyone. I should like to help everyone, if possible -- Jew, gentile, black man, white. We all want to help one another; human beings are like that. We want to live by each other's happiness, not by each other's misery. We don't want to hate and despise one another. In this world there's room for everyone and the good earth is rich and can provide for everyone.

The way of life can be free and beautiful.

But we have lost the way.

Greed has poisoned men's souls, has barricaded the world with hate, has goose-stepped us into misery and bloodshed. We have developed speed but we have shut ourselves in. Machinery that gives abundance has left us in want. Our knowledge has made us cynical, our cleverness hard and unkind. We think too much and feel too little. More than machinery, we need humanity. More than cleverness, we need kindness and gentleness. Without these qualities, life will be violent and all will be lost.

The aeroplane and the radio have brought us closer together. The very nature of these inventions cries out for the goodness in men, cries out for universal brotherhood for the unity of us all. Even now my voice is reaching millions throughout the world, millions of despairing men, women, and little children, victims of a system that makes men torture and imprison innocent people.

To those who can hear me I say, ""Do not despair."" The misery that is now upon us is but the passing of greed, the bitterness of men who fear the way of human progress. The hate of men will pass and dictators die; and the power they took from the people will return to the people and so long as men die, liberty will never perish.

Soldiers: Don't give yourselves to brutes, men who despise you, enslave you, who regiment your lives, tell you what to do, what to think and what to feel; who drill you, diet you, treat you like cattle, use you as cannon fodder. Don't give yourselves to these unnatural men, machine men, with machine minds and machine hearts! You are not machines! You are not cattle! You are men! You have the love of humanity in your hearts. You don't hate; only the unloved hate, the unloved and the unnatural.

Soldiers: Don't fight for slavery! Fight for liberty! In the seventeenth chapter of Saint Luke it is written, ""the kingdom of God is within man"" -- not one man, nor a group of men, but in all men, in you, you the people have the power, the power to create machines, the power to create happiness. You the people have the power to make this life free and beautiful, to make this life a wonderful adventure.

Then, in the name of democracy, let us use that power! Let us all unite!! Let us fight for a new world, a decent world that will give men a chance to work, that will give you the future and old age a security. By the promise of these things, brutes have risen to power, but they lie! They do not fulfill their promise; they never will. Dictators free themselves, but they enslave the people!! Now, let us fight to fulfill that promise!! Let us fight to free the world, to do away with national barriers, to do away with greed, with hate and intolerance.

"c04ta81","I'm dead serious.

Your day will come when you too see first hand proof. You don't honestly believe that the universe is restricted to what 300 years of science has detected? There are vast realms beyond your wildest imaginations waiting to be explored and experienced. There are trillions of other beings - both higher and lower. The Earth is but one intentionally isolated education planet where beings incarnate to grow in consciousness with a certain style. 

In our own octave alone there are six other major divisions of energy densities, each capable of interpenetrating the others and each with corresponding space-time and time-space illusions. There are astral heavens of infinite harmony and stellar hells of self-inflicted suffering. Neither are permanent abodes; rather they are temporary refuges for travelers on long journeys. 

Right now we reside in 3rd density space-time, which means there exists 3 dimensions of space and 1 dimension of time. When we die, we go to time-space which has 3 dimensions of time and 1 dimension of space. Getting our fill of relaxation and reflection in time-space, we then incarnate once again and return to space-time to grow in consciousness some more. Eventually we will graduate to the next density to learn more subtle lessons.

There are billions of higher beings from the higher densities watching over us as we progress. They have more control over every aspect of physical existence than you would ever realize.

These aren't statements of faith they are statements of fact. You won't detect these subtle consciousness-planes with cloud chambers or electron microscopes though, there is only one device on Earth that can interface with these energies - the human.

You think your physical body is all that there is, but you also have invisible bodies. Your intellect does not reside in the physical brain, it only uses the brain as an interface with 3rd density space-time. Your true intellect resides in another plane as another body, a more subtle body. Likewise your soul - something you probably scarcely believe in - also has a body. With training you can feel it as if it were a physical thing, but it is on another plane of consciousness.

These facts have been explored by countless sages and saints throughout history. They've all seen the same things, though some have seen a more complete picture than others. To brush this off as superstition is to deny what you know at the very core of your being. It is a game you play with yourself - and ironically the game shows the awesome power of your own mind. The powers of self-delusion are extraordinary and beautiful, but eventually the magician grows tired of deluding the self and seeks to re-unite with the infnite unity from which he came.

Take atheists for example. These are people who honestly believe that 95% of the population is insane. These are people who have bought the line that religion is based on faith. No true spiritual teaching asks for faith. The path does not require faith. It only requires openness.

I would lament the tragedy of the self-delusion of the atheists if I wasn't aware of how much spiritual power it takes an atheist to convince himself that God does not exist. Most atheists are themselves highly spiritual people and they don't even realize it.. it takes a supreme act of spiritual power to delude the self into disbelieving the most basic fact of the universe - the fact of absolute oneness with all things and that oneness being called God. That oneness becoming twoness through God splitting himself and giving the pieces Free Will. And that Free Will being declared the most supreme natural law, ensuring that each piece of Himself is given true license to create His self as He desires.

TimeCube is good as a parody of conventional Christianity but it is not a parody of consciousness science. Faith is not required to discover the truth, only openness and effort is required. If you meditate with intent and openness, you WILL experience the subtler realms eventually whether you label them as ""just random neuron firings"" or as hallucinations. I tell you this because even though your intellect will not accept it, nevertheless it will be recognized as truth by a deep part of your being and will therefore stick with you. It will take a conscious effort on your part to keep these thoughts down, buried, away.

You already know these things in infinite detail and intimacy. You find me to be an entertaining display because of this deep knowing. The same is true with all enjoyed works of fiction. If you enjoy it, that means your being recognizes an element of truth within it. 

The conscious mind is like the surface of an unimaginably deep ocean. Your atheism is a 6 foot wave that rolls along the surface, but dive down, down, into the dark blue, down towards a warm oceanic vent and there you will find the true self that is infinite in every way imaginable.

"c04qknv","G_Morgan, I think you'll find that the main reason that there are so many Haskell exercises for beginners out there is because recently there's been a surge of interest in Haskell, and many imperative programmers find the functional mindset difficult -- so they blog endlessly about trivial things that excite them.  This is not bad -- it helps get people started, and after all, everyone starts out a newbie -- but admittedly once you've progressed beyond clever ways to implement mathematical sequences, it gets a bit boring to read.  Just recognize that you're not the intended audience anymore.  Congratulations!

Luckily for you, there is a lot of non-trivial software written in Haskell out there.  Once you've progressed beyond tutorials, the next step is the same as it would be in any language -- write code but above all, *read code*.  There's a lot of non-trivial Haskell out there.  Some of it is beautifully written and thus easy to read and understand -- xmonad, for example.  Some of it less so -- lambdabot comes to mind.  Darcs, pugs, and a host of other programs out there are available for you to browse through.  These are real programs.

If you really want something to read about applying Haskell to the real world -- something that *isn't* (just) code -- I would recommend Simon Peyton Jones' excellent [Tackling the awkward squad](http://research.microsoft.com/~simonpj/papers/marktoberdorf/).  SPJ is a functional programming guru and something of a legend in the Haskell community.  In that paper, he starts out with the following blurb:

&gt; There are lots of books about functional programming in Haskell. They tend to concentrate on the beautiful core of functional programming: higher order functions, algebraic data types, polymorphic type systems, and so on.  These lecture notes are about the bits that usually *aren't* written about.  To write programs that are *useful* as well as *beautiful*, the programmer must, in the end, confront the Awkward Squad, a range of un-beautiful but crucial issues, generally concerning interaction with the external world...

These issues of course mostly center around I/O, error detection and recovery, concurrency, and interfacing with foreign functions.  In the paper he describes the development of a web server written in Haskell, which in the end weighs in at around 1500 lines, implements more than the entire HTTP/1.1 standard, is robust enough to run continuously for weeks at a time, and whose ""performance is broadly comparable to the widely-used Apache web server.""  (He qualifies this statement thusly: ""Apache handles 950 connections/sec on the machine we used, while the Haskell web server handles 700 connections/sec.  But this is a bit of an apples-and-oranges comparison: on the one hand Apache has much more functionality while, on the other, the Haskell web server has had very little performance tuning applied."")

This paper is really excellent if you're at that point where you can write most of the prelude list functions in terms of fold{r,l} or unfoldr, when you've seen and understood a million different ways to write fibonacci and factorial sequences, primes, etc, and feel like you really want to develop something non-trivial in the language.

The paper has been updated but I think was originally published in 2001, so the state of Haskell has improved a lot since then (and so has Apache, hehe).  But nonetheless it's a great article that confronts some of the difficulties they had.

Take a look.

Edit: ""Tackling the Awkward Squad"" does not itself have the code to the web server in question, other than occasional snippets.  Much of the code for that can be found in Simon Marlow's paper (also linked from the above site), ""Writing High-Performance Server Applications in Haskell"".

It's been a few decades since I've read the book (my copy was the original 1969 edition), so my recollection is a bit hazy now... perhaps I should read it again, someday.  As near as I recall, however, ""Silkies"" were super-humans from the far future that had evolved (or mutated to) the capability of travelling directly in space.

As far as travelling without benefit or protection of spaceships goes, again Van Vogt was the first to write of such in his story entitled ""The Cataaaaaa"", written in 1947.  This story deals with a cat-like lifeform that possesses the ability to teleport about the galaxy directly, by means of mental manipulation of universal energy fields.

1. Skin tone: Even with makeup, there is a certain type of glow to any person's face.  This is natural because of the oils in our skin.  There is also a certain rough texture to surface skin, even despite a perfect exfoliation routine. You might be able to chalk this up to airbrushing on a regular photo.

2. Eyes: Eyes are water and windows to the soul.  There a certain emotion and brightness in the eyes that is nearly impossible to capture.  The picture is beautiful, but dead.  

3. Hair: I agree with someone else who commented that the hair is too light.  It seems a bit fluffy and blurred on the right side (subject's left) to be believable.  

4. Ear: Take a close look above the earring and it's instantly obvious that this is not a photo.  Either that, or the ear has been reconstructed in plastic surgery.

5. Nose: This is actually quite glaring once you focus on it. The shading is just too abrupt, and goes completely black on the right (subject's left) in a manner that is impossible given the lighting, and yet the shading is kept strangely light on the left (subject's right).  

6. Fabric: Doesn't quite strike me as rubber, but the coloring is way too bright at the neck on the right side (subject's left).  

7. Shoulders: It must be that so much time and attention was spent on the facial features, the shoulders were simply forgotten.  People have body hair.  Really.  Take a look at your shoulders and what do you see?  There's also very little definition other than the outside shape and major bone structure. Oh, and this skin needs a sheen as well.

"cezzx","Popularity and success are different things for the users and owners. Digg has the apparent advantage of a more casual-user friendly UI. Don't get me wrong, reddit is sparse and beautiful, but often people are attracted to the comfortingly familiar and the conventional looking digg interface does it.

Reddit users are quite often hostile towards newbies who might just applaud a submission with a comment that doesn't really provide any value.
I suspect that negative karma the first few times you try reddit it is enough to turn people off permanently. This is good if you want to maintain that cliquish feel, and bad for the owners if they are looking for users from a much wider distribution (the lower side of which often has higher percentages of ad consumers). Consequently, I would also suspect that the average digg user clicks on more ads than the average reddit user does.

Licensing does not scale well with users, but users who click on ads do.

The best of both worlds would be to have a great recommended page that does away with the need for a hot page and in doing so ensures that the commenters and submitters you see are often from the same group you have grown familiar and comfortable with.
