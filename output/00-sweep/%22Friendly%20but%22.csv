"g3e7ba1","&gt; The civil uprising in Belarus has summoned a vast sense of solidarity from around the world. But in practical terms, what is urgently needed is a comprehensive new western strategy towards Europe’s east and those nations unprotected by EU and Nato membership.
&gt; 
&gt; Currently, the formula that the west uses when treating Europe’s east involves the notion of maintaining a certain “social distance” — whatever sophisticated political name this distancing is actually given, be it “EU association agreement” or “eastern partnership”.
&gt; 
&gt; Europe’s east is a very large region, and its most far-flung eastern borders reach up to the Caucasus. However, since the late 1980s several extraordinary processes have taken place across it. There has been a revival of national identity that has overcome postcolonial heritages; a growing awareness of civil liberties as well as the creation of institutions to maintain them; and a search for progressive models of economic development and security protection.
&gt; 
&gt; Unlike the west, Russia has a comprehensive vision of our region and its importance. Whether in Moldova, Ukraine or Belarus, Moscow seeks to establish effective control and create new bridgeheads there to help it expand its influence westwards. This is how Russian president Vladimir Putin envisages the path towards the recreation of the Soviet Union that he so desires.
&gt; 
&gt; There are no magic remedies that can properly cure this “Russian problem”. But, as a realist, I believe there does exist a sequence of practical steps that can be taken. All that is required is the political will to implement them. Recent events in Belarus alone, and the chance that the country may fall under Russian influence indefinitely, requires action from the west and Ukraine. It is time to act, not to hesitate.
&gt; 
&gt; Most important, I urge the EU to treat the civil uprising in Belarus as an integral part of the European process and perspective. To be clear: this requires the EU to reconsider its general attitude to our region. Don’t look at your closest European neighbours as part of a friendly but exotic eastern partnership. Instead, replace your “outstretched hand” approach with a “give-a-hand” approach.
&gt; 
&gt; In practice, this means giving Belarus, Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine the clear signals that EU and Nato membership is achievable and, if a clear action plan to membership is followed, that it is also realistic.
&gt; 
&gt; As part of this process, western Europe should give up any illusions it may have about a possible reset of Russian relations. No such reset is possible while the country is governed by Mr Putin's authoritarian and corrupt regime. Instead of trying to reset relations with Russia with diplomatic gimmicks, it is more important and urgent to increase pressure, and to reset the overall process of peaceful resolution of armed conflicts that Moscow has instigated in our region.
&gt; 
&gt; In Ukraine, we should abandon the illusion that we can make peace in Donbass while leaving Crimea under Russian occupation. These issues cannot remain separated. In Donbass, the Kremlin is trying to wear down Ukraine and the west by offering minor, tactical concessions with the expectation that Kyiv will give in. But the occupied territories of Donetsk and Lugansk will not be free until Crimea itself is liberated. That is the correct position, not vice versa.
&gt; 
&gt; We also need a more comprehensive approach to the peace processes in Georgia and Moldova. I call on the Ukrainian government and its western partners to convene a high-level meeting to bring a new approach to resolving the frozen conflicts in our region. 
&gt; 
&gt; As for economics and business, our region needs investment and funding support from western partners, which is a kind of intervention. Our countries should be invited to join EU country groups such as the Three Seas Initiative, and other infrastructure programmes. A regional fund that helps counteract anti-western propaganda and protect freedom of speech should also be established.
&gt; 
&gt; Last, we need the US and the EU to support our region via a shared sense of solidarity. To do this, I call on our partners to create a high-level joint mission to defend freedom and democracy in Europe’s east. The guiding aim of this mission should be to create a unified vision about how best to continue Europe’s historic processes of unification, and liberation from the threats of authoritarianism, external aggression and disregard for human and national freedoms.
&gt; 
&gt; We need a new plan for eastern Europe. This is in the interests of eastern Europe and all western nations as they seek to maintain their own stability in an uncertain world.

I go back, get in the house and he pulls a pistol on me screaming about how I didn't pay him and I better give him the 150 right now or he'd shoot me. It took about 5 minutes for me to get him to remember that when I gave him the money, he set it down ontop his microwave under his cabinet. He finally goes and looks, it's right there, all 150. He does a complete flip of attitude and is back to being friendly and apologized. He joked that he was honestly about to pull the trigger.

"g2raeqi","Preferably avoid dating girls from your classes - don't shit where you dine, unless you like them a LOT.

If you are interested you need to make a move and make a progress on the ""escalation ladder"". Get the girl alone with you -it doesn't need to be a cliche date. You can try to go for the ""insta date"" once you meet the girl or you can take her number and schedule it for later. And once you two are ther you need to initiate physical contact. First some incidental brushing and lil touches, if she's fine with it then some friendly but intentional contact like high-fives and hugs. If she's fine with them then you need to make intentional sexual contact - put your hands on her! Stroke her thigh, play with her fingers. If she's fine with that, or even better if she reciprocates go for the kiss! Don't ask, just go for it - she'll have plenty of opportunity to reject it.

More on escalation here https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/hlmra/dicarlo_escalation_ladder_concise_and_emphasized/

"g24a5z9","&gt; So the razorback is a recurve takedown? What exactly is a takedown?  

It's as simple that you can remove the limbs from the riser. Takedown recurves are also shorter compared to target recurves.  
Takedown risers are 17""-21"" and target 23""-27"". The length of the limbs are however the same.  

&gt; I'm assuming I should un-string it when not in use?  

It's good practice to unstring when the bow is unused even if nothing will really happen to it if you leave it strung. If it is strung and you drop it for some reason it can cause damage to the bow.    

&gt; Right now I shoot pretty much barebow as far as I know. I have a little brass ring on my string. Is it still considered barebow?  

Yes. As long as you don't add a sight or stabilisers it still counts as a barebow. You can add a rest and a plunger too if you want but people mainly skip the plunger if they want a more traditional feel.  
I will give you a tip and that is to remove the brass nocks and tie your own with some tooth floss or nock string. Brass nocks are beginner friendly but heavy which makes the arrow slower. Tying your own nocks is easy to learn and gives you a small speed boost to the arrow.  

&gt; So the riser is the riser and the limbs are limbs, I figured out that. When transporting a bow should I unstring and remove limbs? When I show up at the range is it normal to bring in a case and put your bow together at the range?  

A case helps with traveling. It holds your bow and all the accesories and tools while also providing protection. It's not necessary but it is nice to have.  
Completely normal to setup the bow at the range.  

&gt; Is using an arrow rest still considered barebow? I shoot off the shelf and I'm fine with it. Should I consider an arrow rest? The guy at the range said something about shooting without an arrow rest but didn't seem too concerned so I figured I'm okay.  

As I wrote earlier, it is still considered barebow. An arrow rest will allow you to use plastic vanes on the arrows and give you more clearance as the arrow passes the riser. If you're fine with shooting off the shelf you can stick with it as either works fine.  
You can however buy a rest for cheap and try it out and see what you like the most.

"fwhqn7c","I am a big fan of assertive and direct (but kind) behavior.

As a man who was been with my wife for 17 years (married for 9), I can say that this would legitimately freak me out. It kind of freaked me out just reading it.

Thinking about how I would deal with it, I came up with:

1. Go somewhere friendly but neutral, like a restaurant (not possible right now, I know).
2. Make it clear that you are in no way judging or calling out her actions, but point out that as an equal part of the relationship (I wouldn't call it a marriage, as that might derail the conversation), I feel confused by her new way of talking about our life together.
3. I would follow that up with a few more I statements, making sure not to judge the behavior, but to honestly express myself--the relationship feels strong, I feel connected, I enjoy our sex life, etc.
4. I would end with a request, if she feels comfortable, about why she feels the need to label the relationship as such, combined with the statement that nothing is off the table.

Even typing this out made my BP elevate, because it's a big swing, even handled with care. IF she's having a break, this is going to end poorly. IF she's decided she wants to be his girlfriend again for WHATEVER reason, she might be willing to discuss the situation.

This probably isn't about the OP, and asking if he's done something wrong will yield no new information. He probably hasn't. In fact, his lack of confrontation (a positive) has probably kept the rest of their relationship on solid ground.

To remove it from context, if I suddenly started cosplaying as a member of the cast of the original Fast and the Furious movie and my wife said nothing, I'd just go about my business. If she said in mixed company I was dressing like someone from Gone in 60 Seconds, I'd correct her.

"fvc3l18","It's all grand saying ""32 Counties"" and ""Give us the 6 Counties back"". There's nothing more i would love to see than Ireland reunited. However when you actually sit down and think about it and see through the  romanticization (Is that even a word?)  of it, It's not as clear cut as you'd imagine. 

Firstly, I think the separation has gone long past simply one being controlled by different government. I feel both north and south have culturally progressed differently. Not in the meaning that one is behind the other but more so how people interact, the craic etc. I've spent a good bit of time interacting with different parts of society in northern Ireland, Very friendly but quite different to us southern counterparts. Some parts of Nothern Ireland literately feel like they are only a mile down the road from home but others feel like an entirely different country altogether. I can't see that changing if we were to be re-unified. 

You have to take into account that if there was a referendum and unification won, you can be damned sure it would be very close. You've got the losing side who simply won't accept it and that'll cause a lot of chaos. Chaos that the population in Northern Ireland don't need because they've had enough of it. I wouldn't be in the position to comment accurately but I feel NI is a more peaceful place now in the last 10 years and I wouldn't want to see the destruction and violence escalate again. 

I simply think it's way too early to start talking reunification. It's too fresh. Not to mention we would have to accept the beliefs of the unionists aswell and respect their right to march and celebrate that weekend in July. I don't think i'd be fit for it to be quite honest so it goes both ways.",1592573451,"i've spent a good bit of time interacting with different parts of society in northern ireland, very friendly but quite different to us southern counterparts.","friendly but quite","friendly","but",FALSE,"very friendly but quite different","different","very","quite",1
"fvbyth7","On Juneteenth I like to read liberation narratives to celebrate! Here's my favorite, and a local one, from Garland White, published in the Christian Reporter:

""I have just returned from the city of Richmond; my regiment was among the first that entered that city. I marched at the head of the column, and soon I found myself called upon by the officers and men of my regiment to make a speech, with which, of course, I readily complied. A vast multitude assembled on Broad Street, and I was aroused amid the shouts of ten thousand voices, and proclaimed for the first time in that city freedom to all mankind. After which the doors of all the slave pens were thrown open, and thousands came out shouting and praising God, and Father, or Master Abe, as they termed him.

In this mighty consternation I became so overcome with tears that I could not stand up under the pressure of such fullness of joy in my own heart. I refired to gain strength, so I lost many important topics worthy of note.

Among the densely crowded concourse there were parents looking for children who had been sold south of this state in tribes, and husbands came for the same purpose; here and there one was singled out in the ranks, and an effort was made to approach the gallant and marching soldiers, who were too obedient to orders to break ranks.

We continued our march as far as Camp Lee, at the extreme end of Broad Street, running westwards. In camp the multitude followed, and everybody could participate in shaking the friendly but hard hands of the poor slaves. Among the many broken-hearted mothers looking for their children who had been sold to Georgia and elsewhere, was an aged woman, passing through the vast crowd of colored, inquiring for one by the name of Garland H. White, who had been sold from her when a small boy, and was bought by a lawyer named Robert Toombs (2), who lived in Georgia. Since the war has been going on she has seen Mr. Toombs in Richmond with troops from his state, and upon her asking him where his body-servant Garland was, he replied: “He ran off from me at Washington, and went to Canada. I have since learned that he is living somewhere in the State of Ohio.” Some of the boys knowing that I lived in Ohio, soon found me and said, “Chaplain, here is a lady that wishes to see you.” I quickly turned, following the soldier until coming to a group of colored ladies. I was questioned as follows:

“What is your name, sir?”
“My name is Garland H. White.”
“What was your mother’s name?”
“Nancy.”
“Where was you born?”
“In Hanover County, in this State.”
“Where was you sold from?”
“From this city.”
“What was the name of the man who bought you?”
“Robert Toombs.”
“Where did he live?”
“In the State of Georgia.”
“Where did you leave him?”
“At Washington.”
“Where did you go then?”
“To Canada.”
“Where do you live now?”
“In Ohio.”

“This is your mother, Garland, whom you are now talking to, who has spent twenty years of grief about her son.”

I cannot express the joy I felt at this happy meeting of my mother and other friends. But suffice it to say that God is on the side of the righteous, and will in due time reward them. I have witnessed several such scenes among the other colored regiments.

Late in the afternoon, we were honored with his Excellency, the President of the United States, Lieutenant-General Grant, and other gentlemen of distincfion. We made a grand parade through most of the principal streets of the city, beginning at Jeff Davis’s mansion, and it appeared to me that all the colored people in the world had collected in that city for that purpose. I never saw so many colored people in all my life, women and children of all sizes running after Father, or Master Abraham, as they called him.

To see the colored people, one would think they had all gone crazy. The excitement at this period was unabated, the tumbling of walls, the bursting of shells, could be heard in all directions, dead bodies being found, rebel prisoners being brought in, starving women and children begging for greenbacks and hard tack, constituted the order of the day. The Fifth [Massachusetts] Cavalry; colored, were still dashing through the streets to protect and preserve the peace, and see that no one suffered violence, they having fought so often over the walls of Richmond, driving the enemy at every point.

Among the first to enter Richmond was the 28th U.S.C.T. better known as the First Indiana Colored Volunteers…

Some people do not seem to believe that the colored troops were the first that entered Richmond. Why, you need not feel at all timid in giving the truthfulness of my assertion to the four winds of the heavens, and let the angels re-echo it back to the earth, that the colored soldiers of the Army of the James were the first to enter the city of Richmond. I was with them, and am still with them, and am willing to stay with them until freedom is proclaimed throughout the world. Yes, we will follow this race of men in search of liberty through the whole Island of Cuba.

1. He is somewhat right in that perception is reality. You don’t want to be perceived as doing something that may be inappropriate, and then have to prove yourself innocent. You don’t have to make it a point not to be alone with women though. Just respect boundaries, be friendly but professional, and you should be fine. 

2. The not drinking advice is extreme and a bit impractical. Drinking is a social activity and there are many steps in between having a drink some times and being a full on alcoholic. It is 100 percent up to you whether or not you drink - just be safe and do what you’re comfortable with. But if I had to advise you either way, I’d say college is the time to get used to drinking socially. You don’t want to be a full grown adult, in their mid 20s let’s say, who is new to drinking and can’t hold their alcohol. 

3. Again, extreme and impractical. These things tend to happen when they happen. If you happen to meet someone you like during college, you should absolutely go for it. Why not be happy? You’re young and right now life is about having fun. If it gets serious and turns long term, great. If not, great too. Either way, it’s life experience that’s good to have under your belt for when your older. If you don’t date because of circumstance, that’s one thing. But don’t cheat yourself of experiences by having a hardline no dating policy. 

4. Time spent having fun is not a waste. In fact, you need it to be a balanced, healthy human being. Go out with friends, make connections, and do shit for experiences. Those are the things that’ll define your college experience and those are the things that’ll make you interesting.",1590644611,"just respect boundaries, be friendly but professional, and you should be fine.","friendly but professional","friendly","but",FALSE,"friendly but professional","professional",NA,NA,1

If you prefer not to have the snake around, I'd put on work gloves and, if you're super worried, a long sleeve jacket that's denim or leather.

Plant polymers can replace 99% of oil made plastics, clothes and cosmetics, etc. With Tesla’s announcement of a million mile battery it will soon be cheaper to produce electric vehicles than gas engines. The past decade of innovation has led to solar and hydro power being more efficient than oil/gas and by the end of the decade wind will be as well.

Hard fact is that oil is not needed at this point. There are alternatives available for every single one of it’s uses. And the alternatives are not only environmentally friendly, but also cheaper to produce. 

However, it would take trillions of dollars to provide the infrastructure needed to phase out oil and bring in said alternatives. 

So it genuinely will probably take several decades for oil to be a thing of the past. In canada we’ve certainly seen the peak already though and there’s no reason to think we’ll ever get back to a new one",1590170512,"and the alternatives are not only environmentally friendly, but also cheaper to produce.","friendly, but also","friendly","but",TRUE,"environmentally friendly , but also cheap","cheap","environmentally","also",1

So first: The lady. 

I met this older lady working a factory job. She was attractive and friendly. But... and I would find this out later.. married and depressed. 

The factory was a temp job, and I ended up getting laid off and found another job. This new job was working for a travelling inventory counting company. 

So like 3 months later I'm holed up in a hotel 6 hours away from my hometown for work. This woman, apparently on the edge of a bad day decides shes going to drive that 6 hours to meet me at the hotel and stay the night. 

I said yes. Because I was 20 and eager to finally get laid. 

She shows up, drunk off her ass. Which annoyed me, because that means she was drinking and driving. 

Now of course we got down. But she was a dead fish. Like awake, but giving no effort. It was so boring that my first time having sex lasted 2 hours. It just wasnt really that fun. The best part was that her tubes were tied and I didnt need a condom. 

We banged a few more times that night and once before I went to work. And like, the emotional stimulation was there. Like I had a great day at work. And I was energetic and upbeat. 

But later I found out that she was sad because she got into an argument with her husband. So effectively. I became a home wrecker without trying.

ISO beers (downtown SJ) - lots of cans &amp; bottles plus always a sour or three on draft 


Original gravity (downtown SJ) - great gourmet sausages and duck fat fries. Always a small handful of sours on draft plus cans and bottles. 


South Winchester BBQ (Campbell) - fantastic food with extensive can selection and a sour always pouring...this place is one of my absolute favorites as they tend to carry Alvarado street....which by the way. 


Alvarado street brewery (Monterey) - lovely patio and expansive indoor seating options. This is my #1 favorite brewery. They SO MANY sour beers, mostly kettle sours.  The triple haole punch and blueberry brunch bonanza are ridiculous. Not only that, this is a rare brewery where I am happy to drink off the sour list. I HATE IPA...but their juice cruise IPA is freaking delicious. Anyway..


Sante Adarius (Capitola) - Dog friendly but very small. They have great complex sours and super big bottles. Always a crowd favorite, try Lady in Grey. 


The Rare Barrel (Berkeley) - lots of seating, great snacks and LOTS of sours. They nail light, fresh and subtle. 


Herimatage (San Jose) - Dog friendly, usually a taco truck and tasting boards available. They keep a small handful of sours on draft at all time plus have some tremendous stouts. Personally I find their sours to be dangerously close to bitter/tart instead of true sour so it's not my jam but wanted to add it in case it's yours. 


Lazy Duck (San Jose) - suuuuuper tiny in an industrial lot. Board games and fun staff though. This place is basically 80% sours and also offers tasters. Mostly interesting fruity combos, again leaning more towards tart than sour. 


Barebottle (San Francisco) - cool atmosphere, huge interior, taco truck, arcade games and tasting flights. Very unique flavors and, somehow, textures. Also a great place to meet dogs. 


Spread (Camlbell) - hip little sandwich shop with a great people watching patio. Usually at least one sour on draft and 2 huge fridges always stocked with a great selection of sour styles. 


Out of the Barrel (The Pruneyard) - bright cheery surrounding with board games and bagged snacks, though theres plenty of food in your immediate vicinity and they dont mind if you bring it over. Always a tasty sour or too on draft and fridges ready with cans to-go. 


Humble Sea (Santa cruz) - gorgeous patio always packed with dogs and a food truck that is always there. No idea what style it is so I'm gonna call it...casual bougey? Always a few good sours on draft, usually very light and fresh flavors like lime and sea salt. 


Aptos street grill (Aptos) - cute little patio and quaint country vibe inside. Always a huge selection of draft beers and never missing a sour. Plus killer BBQ ( same owner as South Winchester. Plus Trail Dust (Morgan hill) and BBQ 152 (Gilroy) check em all out!)

I loved every aspect of her, because each of them is inseparable from the other. Of course, there a limits placed on this love, such as if she was abusive or violent... But, I loved her wholly, and that is what I mean by unconditional.”

I’m not a big fan of loving people’s flaws. I want me and my lover to commit to improving ourselves. 

“I am seeing her Saturday. We need to swap belongings, and she has half of wardrobe here at mine. I know that the 'right' thing to do is to be kind, gentle and friendly, but not emotional or place her under pressure. But, I still love her. I love her a lot... And I am scared that I will be unable to not express that to her in one form or another. Do you have any advice on how to handle this situation?”

Based on your posts, she already knows you love her. I guess you could ask her if there’s anything she would let you do to help her achieve her own happiness. 

“A part of me deeply wants to use this situation as a last chance to get some answers and closure. But I don't want to push her away, and leave her last memory of me as of someone who placed her under more pressure than she could cope with.”

You’re probably not going to get answers. Neither she nor you probably have the self-knowledge, knowledge of philosophy and psychology to be able to figure it out. A really good cognitive therapist or CBT could help you, but that still costs a lot of effort. And it’s not necessarily worth it for her to go through the emotional anguish to get the answers even if she did have the ability, at least not quickly enough for your satisfaction. Her moral purpose, and yours, is to live for herself, to think and choose to the best of her ability what’s necessary for her life and happiness. 

You really don’t need the answers. You know what went wrong on your end and you know how to fix it. You’re already ready to start a better relationship as soon as you find someone and recover from your break up.

"fkpm8dg","Thank you for your response, I really appreciate you taking the time to respond to me, a stranger. 

I believe that you are right, about her potentially feeling guilty. The key reason why I wrote the letter to her was to take responsibility for my emotions and acknowledge the burden that my inability to cope was placing on her. Throughout our relationship, I felt I had made it clear that sometimes I can withdraw and be quiet... It was hard for her to understand at first, but I thought that she did. 

Yes, you seem right about your next point too, that those bad feelings must have flooded back in my absence. I am often asking myself what would have happened if I hadn't of left that morning, and we had of had the chance to talk through those feelings. I can't go back in time, but god if I could...

I also often wonder if I hadn't of tried to rush this process, and instead told her that I needed more than two weeks to work through this stuff. Again, benefit of hindsight, and I shouldn't try to imagine what ifs...

Ok so. I'm (19) in college right now and I only have one really good friend (20) who I spend a LOT of my time with. We're pretty close friends and I've met their family twice now. They seem like really nice people, they are very open and friendly and interesting, but I feel incredibly uncomfortable around them.
At first I couldn't really pinpoint why, but after talking it over with my therapist she says it makes perfect sense. I grew up in an abusive household, my parents weren't always bad or aggressive, but they could be very unpredictable. Even though I've moved out, I guess this still affects me because the thought of meeting someone's family makes me so nervous. Even though I know they probably won't do anything terrible, in the moment I always go into this weird almost defensive mode
The first time I met my friends parents, it was a pretty last minute thing, and they were very friendly. But I could feel I was being very withdrawn and any interaction was just me trying to be a people pleaser. I knew it must have felt weird on their end too because my friend kept pulling me aside and asking if I was okay.
The second time was tonight. My friend asked me if I wanted to meet them again but I said I had some chores I needed to do at home. Before I could leave then their parents ended up showing up early. They tried to invite me to eat with them, but I declined, again using those chores as an excuse. I had been having an incredibly rough few days and the thought of having to be around too many people sounded like a little too much. Especially since families/parents make me so nervous.

Am I the asshole? Part of me feels like an absolute dick because they are genuinely nice and chill people, I just have some weird, unresolved trauma and shouldn't automatically jump into fight/flight/freeze mode. The other part of me understands that unlearning these reactions doesn't happen in a day and that I should go easy on myself. I just can't shake this feeling that I am being selfish and rude to these people who have done nothing wrong to me.

"fhf4czy","Exactly. Which I think is partly why I didn’t realize how bad things really were. My mom would walk around like nothing was wrong. 

My step dad at the time was one of those people who was awesome at first, really thoughtful and friendly. But then after about a year of them being together, he changed. Unfortunately, my mom married him after knowing him for 3 months, and she’s not exactly quick to get divorced. She was with him for years, until I brought her into my home to help her escape him. (That arrangement didn’t work out, but that’s a whole other story.)

I don’t really want to get into details, but her ex was emotionally abusive in public and sexually abusive in private. I’m certain my mom didn’t know about the latter until years later, when my now-husband told her while I was in surgery. 

I really do love her and only want the best for her! Thank you for that, I really do try to be compassionate. It’s hard sometimes.

"fhf1282","I used to and my situation is somewhat similar but somewhat different as well. I (28m) can usually make new friends out easily and everyone thinks I’m so outgoing and friendly. But I’m like an average looking person from my perspective and average height. But when it comes to approaching women in a sense of trying to meet someone with the intentions of possibly finding some chemistry I’m desperately terrible. I’ve dated people through friends and randomly meeting people in college however it’s very rarely ended well. We’re on different paths or at different stages in life. Even if things were going well for a while, something happens that gets in the way. For instance my last relationship, she had just started nursing school and literally said she couldn’t handle the stress of both and acknowledged she was being selfish but that things weren’t going to change. 30 days prior to her starting everything was good. Myself, I own my house and am an engineer so I’m just trying to say I can be there when you need support...but no. 

My mother and sister always try to tell me that I’ll find some one that puts in the same level of effort and truly cares everyday. But I just struggle with not feeling creepy approaching strangers in public and then worry of rejection. While most of my friends have either just had kids, married or getting married. It just feels lonely often, whether in a crowd or not. I feel almost bipolar when it comes to meeting people. I can talk for hours with anyone, but going to approach an attractive female is difficult for me. 

Maybe I’m just using this post as personal therapy but it just sucks to feel like I wasted most of my college days and majority of my 20s dating the wrong people when I (for the most part) have treated all my gf’s well for it just to have something dumb ruin it. I tell myself that the person who I’ll end up with would never let something small ruin it or would keep fighting for me in the tough times to get through it, but I wonder if I’ll find that before I give up. Focusing so much time and energy on trying to find someone will be outweighed by focusing more on my career at some point. 
 But to go back, I used to hear songs from times in my life that I was happier and would find myself shedding a few tears, or a movie would get me more emotional than I should be. Or seeing my friends relationships on social media seem so genuine has caused me to compare my situation. But all I can do is hope I guess. 

And I hope for you and everyone too, that you can find happiness in yourself and if someone’s lucky enough that you let them in on your happiness.",1581534020,"i (28m) can usually make new friends out easily and everyone thinks i’m so outgoing and friendly.","outgoing and friendly","friendly",NA,FALSE,"so outgoing and friendly","outgoing",NA,"so",0

"fg6ozxm","Figure out who the alpha is. Get him on your side!  Laugh at his (appropriate) jokes. Praise him when he deserves it. Be (appropriately) physical with him—fist bumps and high fives. Make your class very physical in general with games and galley walks—boys respond well to that and it keeps them engaged. 

As a young female teacher you will likely become an object of affection for some students. Use that  power—be friendly but professional and show mild interest in them as people and they will internalized that affection and seek more of it. Since you are young they will likely identify you as more of a friend (or an older sister type) than an authority figure, especially the older students, in that case use tactics that seem more like peer pressure (“I always like guys who use proper grammar, it shows how intelligent they are!” vs “it’s important to have proper grammar to become successful and respected in your future careers”). But make it known when they are acting out or not meeting expectations that you are an authority figure by giving proper consequences—be clear and consistent about what your limits are. 

One example that stands out for me:
I had a student that had a crush on me (he was 18 and I was 26) and would constantly do things to get my attention—I gave him the attention he wanted when what he was doing was positive and ignored him when it wasn’t. He was popular and well liked so getting him on my side and indulging his crush in a professional way went a LONG way towards keeping the whole class in line and on my side. One day, during break I was next door in my colleague’s class when this student took an orange off my desk. I came back in and all the other kids ratted him out in a teasing way. He stole it to get my attention and some laughs from his peers (and it was an orange, it’s not like it was a big deal) and to see what he could get away with. It was very much just him innocently flirting with me, but stealing, even an orange, is not acceptable behavior in my class. I gave him a stern look held out my hand and said “please give me my orange back.” Once he realized I was serious he returned it bashfully, and I told him stealing was not ok behavior. I then preceded to teach the class as I normally do. Later I saw him in the hallway with his friends and he tried to do something funny to get my attention. I just gave him a sad look and said “I’m disappointed in you,” and kept on my way. The following day, he shows up after school with and orange and an apology note telling me he’s sorry for what he did. I was soooo happy that he had done this and told him all was forgiven. 

Building that rapport with him, and professionally indulging his crush meant that  I didn’t need to do anything other than subtly express my disappointment for him to reflect on his behavior, and correct it. It also prevented me from becoming a “mean teacher” and alienating my other students as it might have if I had yelled at him or written him up. Not all, but the majority of my trouble male students have behaved well and been much more respectful to me than other teachers because I invest a little more personalized attention and interest in them, making them not want to disappoint me. It also has made my classroom management much less stressful. But you do need to strike a balance between being too friendly and being too professional and that can be challenging at times. 

Final word of advice, if you can tolerate it—wear heals when you teach! Unless you are super tall, you’ll likely have some students who are taller than you and it helps make you seem more authoritative and like the adult in the room if you aren’t always the one looking up to students! (I always switch into heals when I teach and wear flats before and after school, and during prep/lunch—I can’t stand being in heals all day).

"fg6ivnq","I'm an older male who has little issue finding models to shoot nude, TFP, in my basement. My no show rate for scheduled shoots was high when I started out but now it is very low.  With new models I do still find people get excited to shoot with me and then lose interest. I think that just goes with the territory but I'm to the point where I don't spend a lot of time interacting with new to me models. Here's how I got to where I am; a formula that I am pretty sure will work for anybody.

I let every model know that they are welcome to check with any model I've shot. I do 30-60 shoots a year and I've got almost all of them tagged on my Facebook page. 

I've got a solid portfolio online. I win awards, exhibit in juried shows, and get published.

I have an open door policy. I will shoot anybody who is interested and willing to shoot something that I am interested in shooting. They are welcome to bring anybody who they want as an escort and if they can't find an escort I find an assistant that they are comfortable with to help me with the shoot.

At the start of every shoot I give the models a talk about how the shoot will run; they get to see every shot I take, if  one is objectionable I delete it on the spot, I don't touch ever without permission and all touch is appropriate... The point of the talk is in part to make sure that if I do something that makes them uncomfortable they feel absolutely free to let me know. Some models who have been shooting with me for years have the ""model talk"" memorized.

I never expect a model to shoot nude, regardless of the number of times they have done so before. If they are not feeling it we do something else. If they start shooting nude and decide they are no longer feeling it, we switch to a clothed shoot.

I keep relationships with models friendly but professional. I don't date models or try to get involved in their personal lives in any way (except for safety issues). That said, I've become friends with models; they've stayed in my home, met my family, some have even become friends with my children. I've gone to baby showers and weddings. Although I'm an art photographer I've done engagement, maternity, baby, and family portraits for models. I would guess one model in 25 becomes a friend but always it is one who chooses to do so and extends invitations. I never initiate a friendship. 

Now that I am better established, I rarely post looking for new to me models, unless I want something special (e.g. ability to do a difficult pose, maternity, or the hardest thing to find a tattoo free model) for a particular shot. I get most new to me models as a referral from another model or a photographer and that really makes for more reliable shoots.",1580569170,"i keep relationships with models friendly but professional.","friendly but professional","friendly","but",FALSE,"friendly but professional","professional",NA,NA,1
"ffpkyp6","I lived in Oklahoma with a saint and he had a fine life. He had free access to indoors and outdoors  via dog doors. Inside was air conditioned, but he would often go out and romp around in the heat of summer. I know this is controversial but we shaved him in the summer and he seemed to be fine with it. The only problem we had with that was when the groomners would take the hair off his tail and it would lose all wind resistance and he would be able to bend steel I beams with the damned thing.

Mind you he had 13 acres to run around on and he grew up there, so he may just not have known any better and having the space to run around.

I say living in Florida is not a solo reason not to get a saint. I think that the wrong set of factors would be a disaster but if you understand what you are doing and you have the right environment it could work just fine.

If you just want a big dog like a saint, then a great dane is a short hair that is large and friendly, but that is a conversation for you and your wife to have. If she is just in love with saints and that is all it will be, then you guys need to talk about quality of life and how your home/living situation will impact your future dog's life.

A few suggestions you can take or leave as it applies to what you want: 

Get the boring pine box your parents want. Have mourners supplied with texters, colorful sticky notes, and glitter. During a five minute silence, have people write down a memory, goodbye message or prayer on a sticky note and then later have them attack the note and a cat sticker to the casket, transforming the out of place sombre box into a rainbow mess of color and love.

If you are having the service at the crematorium, audio record yourself waking up in a box and shouting for somebody to get you out as the box disappears into the incinerator. 

Give your own video eulogy, being friendly but reasonably proper. Have the wake in a pub with tv screens available and use them to crash your own wake, stumbling around acting drunk, making inappropriate comments etc.

"ffp7qu6","It was!! I remember that boy showing his cabinmates what he used for fake breasts (the cabin was divided into a girl's side and a boy's side, so it was mixed-gender).
They giggled. They touched it and squealed. But they were all *smiling.* And curious enough to ask him questions.

Despite being a Protestant Christian camp, it managed to be welcoming to people who would usually feel oppressed by Christians. Sadly, it wasn't very racially diverse, but my part of the country *isn't* very racially diverse. (Besides which, can you think of anything whiter than a Christian summer camp? :P)

There was also a tradition that on Thursday of our week at camp, varies opposite-gender couples (usually sweethearts, and sometimes pairs of counselors) would swap clothing with their partner, then wear it as they accompanied each other to dinner at the mess hall. I have no idea how such a tradition started, seeing how casual it was. 

I had a girlfriend at the camp, and I had trepidatiously suggested we participate. Unfortunately, she came from a very conservative area and thought I was joking. “Well, I think I have a nice sundress you could wear,” she said with a laugh.

Why would you even do this? This is your workplace. These are your colleagues, not your mates or your friends! 

Personally, I'd be very alienated by someone who did this at my work place. Sure there are people who are like this naturally and easily get a long with everyone. But I find such a behavior (presents, etc.) a bit suspect and exhausting. No one asked for your presents and food and now they might be socially obligated to be nice to you, even if they just want to work at this place and have no intention of getting to know you. 
This is not how and where you make real friends. Plus it seems a bit desperate which of course people notice and then talk about it and then speculate and start rumors about why you act so weird.

Calm down and learn to read a room, before even thinking about making friends. Get the lay of the land by being friendly, but not overtly so and by being professional (no presents, no food, do your job). Don't learn everyone's family history in 2 months ... that's  creepy, intrusive and screams desperate.

"ff61e8t","I've gone through something similar with a close friend of mine. She does pretty much the same thing with her boyfriend (they've been together for a little over a year now) and I called her out on it. I didn't bring it up with her specifically because of this - she was being pretty inconsiderate of a lot of people at the time and something she did made me snap. 

I called her out on all her behaviour, about her boyfriend I told her it isn't fair on him and everyone can see it and it's really shitty. After we talked she realised she wasn't thinking about her actions and apologised to all our friends. She changed for a while but honestly she's just gone back to her old ways especially with her boyfriend (don't think she really tried to change how she acted with him at all).

From my experience, I'd say bring it up with her in a friendly but firm way, don't outright criticise her and instead go in with an advice-giving attitude, but definitely let her know it's making you all uncomfortable. Maybe she just doesn't realise and needs to be told? In that case it could be beneficial for everyone.

"fei8i7b","Well, technically speaking it was a tea party, but don’t imagine something too fancy or anything it was pretty casual. Nevertheless it was a large gathering of people, most of whom had been going to this weekly event for a long time, and I really didn’t know anyone. I found out about it here on Reddit actually. Everyone there was cool and generally friendly but to call it accepting or welcoming aren’t adjectives I would use, not because people weren’t, but because those things were so much of a given it didn’t need to be addressed. It was for trans people but it wasn’t about *being* trans, just a bunch of trans people in their own private gathering being themselves. For a baby trans like me it was perhaps overwhelming in its lack of being *about* being trans, as everything is through that lens for me now and I guess maybe I’m not at the point yet where I just own it all the time. Instead I’m still in my own head about it. Also I’m just a huge introvert and I kind of hate that sometimes but idk how to be anything else.

I guess the whole reason I went originally was to try and make a connection, make a friend, because I have absolutely no one, but I felt like I failed to do that. I chatted with people, made myself known, but a point in the night came where I was standing there alone and feeling like I shouldn’t be there, like I was out of place. I got hit with a massive wave of dysphoria and imposter syndrome and I just left.

Right now my support system is Reddit. I don’t have a single person irl who can help me through this, who I can go out with as a friend and feel safe. I’m literally transitioning alone, all my old friends and family bailed. So I had it in my head that this was an answer but now I can’t decide if I want to go back next week or wait a while and figure myself out more. I know I can go at my own pace. I just don’t know what the right pace is.

Still, I guess you’re right that I should probably just go easy on myself. It was just frustrating to realize that it wouldn’t matter if I’d spent 5 years on hormones by now and had my whole look figured out or if I was out full time. I mean that’s the whole thing of imposter syndrome is that voice saying “if I just do X than I’ll have whatever I think is missing” but it’s not true, because I’d still be the same socially awkward person looking for a deeper connection than small talk.

From there you can fill in the details of your character. think about how those traits push and pull with each other and how they can be used to generate story/conflict with your other characters.

"fdpubgx","A friendly warning in regard to custom work.

Custom work can be exhausting - mentally and physically.  People with custom requests tend to take ownership over the build immediately.  Many micromanage and have no concept of your skills, equipment, supplies and timetable.  They expect a lot of back and forth convos - all requiring photos, explanation and justification.  They change their mind and don't care if that extra supply/time cost is worn by you.  Then when it's finished and they are happy, they also tend to think they deserve a discount because they ""helped"".  As I said ""ownership"".  If you are crunching the numbers for your per hour rate - add another 33% for all these time sucks.  Ask for a reasonable deposit before you start working and provide a timetable of the build - this also gives them a realistic insight at how long this type of craft takes.

Be prepared to be friendly but firm.  Nail down how many progress reports you will do and how many changes are acceptable at what stage of the build.  Stress that you will take artistic license in certain situations.  Explain the quality of the source material you require.  If you think someone has unrealistic expectations - be prepared to walk away from the sale.  I know that's difficult but in the long run it's better to refund than have a client who you know won't be happy with the finished piece no matter what you do.  

If it ends up not being feasible in regard to your time and effort - stop.  You can always do premade general images of different dog/cat breeds.  Those may end up looking like their pet anyway and they will be able to see the finished piece and buy it immediately. 

I stopped doing custom builds on Etsy - for all those reasons.  I still do occasional big commissions for theme restaurants and bars and gallery/interior design requests - people who know why they are hiring an artist as opposed to trying to vicariously create through me.

Most of the time it helps the animals to ask tough provoking questions instead of aggressive statements. 

Having said that, some people just don’t get it and never will and it’s completely understandable  to just lose your temper as a vegan sometimes.

It was a surprisingly wasteful system for how ""sustainable"" it was proclaimed to be, particularly since I was giving them fresh organic food, honey, and grain (depending on species) instead of the waste that an industrial business would probably use or the studies were often based on.

In an attempt to be more eco-friendly and less wasteful, I started cutting back a little on their percentage of rations they got for the population size, and letting the populations get bigger before I harvested them. This lead to cannibalism, them trying much harder to escape their prison, and some started to get sick, but the system was still surprisingly wasteful.

"f6jpjhj","Need some suggestions.  I had my turn signal stalk replaced by a mobile tech a few weeks ago.  The turn signal would randomly lock on a left turn signal when tapping it.  The mobile tech that replaced it was super nice and friendly, but accidentally scraped up the matte white finish of the dash trim.  I didn't notice it for a few days, and when I did notice it, I thought it was dried up liquid.  It was directly behind the turn signal stalk, and I'd never seen it before.  I tried rubbing it off and of course, I then made it worse.  To add insult to injury, the turn signal stalk that he replaced was actually worse than the previous one at locking.  Almost ever single time I hit the stalk to signal a left turn, it would lock.  The first one only locked about 20% of the time.   


Anyways, I put in another request for service, but they would only do mobile.  I requested they fix the scratches, sent them photos of it, and asked for a new replacement turn signal stalk.  They requested the photos, I sent them, the tech showed up at my house to fix the stalk but didn't have a clue about the photos I'd sent to the mobile team of the scratched dash.  The tech was super awesome, actually replaced and made sure that the new turn signal stalk worked like it should!  I can't tell you how happy that makes me that I'm not constantly getting my turn signal locked every time I signal left to change lanes.  The tech also took more photos of the scratch, I explained to him how I had made it worse by thinking it would rub off, etc.  Anyways, he texted me back the next day saying it had been approved for replacement and all was good.  I just have to wait for replacement.  

Then today I get a text from a different person saying that there was no way the scratch was caused by the turn signal replacement and that my request was denied.

"f6jnpdq","I recommend taking a look at bestplaces.net the info there is a bit old as I think it get updated with the census and gets a couple soft updates in-between but it should answer some of your questions. The best part is you can side by side compare two locations so you can match it against what Chicago has to offer.

1) weather. It cools down with a few heat bumps around October. 20 years ago we would have snow on the ground for Halloween somewhat consistently. Now we usually see snow closer to January and it waits until mid March to really go away. It rarely gets super cold but we can see negative fahrenheit for a couple days. Summers get into the 90's for a week or two sometimes breaking 100.

2) Jobs are rough here. We have a lot of them though mostly either part time, low pay, or if you're lucky both! /s Jokes aside, according to rent and mortgage affordibility (assuming about 40-50% of your wage goes to housing) a large number of individuals simply don't make enough to live here and thus have more roommates than rooms. Couples tend to fair a little better but it's still not really affordable for most of them. The reality is unless you're already skilled in a high paying position, have a degree, or can remote work for a higher waged position. Affording housing, food, and entertainment can be very challenging. Many of Bend's work force lives in the slightly cheaper town of Redmond which is about 10-14 miles north of Bend proper.

3)The people overall are fair kind albeit a bit aloof. There seems to be a massive issue with situational and spacial awareness. Navigating many of the grocery stores (unless you go at odd hours such as late at night or during mid Sunday) is an absolute nightmare as it seems like most people forget that they're sharing the aisles with other people. The driver's aren't a whole lot better but I keep hearing that we've got better divers than most places which makes me wonder how anyone gets anywhere in other states. I got a dashcam because I am **certain** that someone is going to hit me out of negligence. 

There is A LOT of animosity toward transplants from the more native dwellers. You have to understand that Bend nearly doubled is population in about 10 years. Notice I didn't say size, but **population.** That is an important distinction. We have too little housing for the population so prices are way out of proportion to wages, road infrastructure is frankly kind of a joke(a least pot holes are starting to get taken care of), and the internet providers here is just about trying to pick the lesser of two shitty evils.

4)Bend advertises at pet friendly, but few places seem to allow animals. Rentals are especially difficult to get with your furry friends.

5)Going back to cost of living, fun is an interesting thing. We have a lot to offer in breweries and trails. If you can do it in a forest, on a mountain, in water, under ground or in the sky; we've got **something** for you. Just expect that everything has a price tag and place for the love of God pick up after yourselves and your pets.

6) Bend is the biggest town for (guesstimating) probably 100+ miles. There are places around Bend between 10-50 miles to scratch about any itch, but if you miss a specific experience from a big city environment, you're looking at 3 or more hours in a car to find it.

I hope this helps, and good luck. The best advice I can give is if you're going to move here. Ask yourself how you can mesh with the culture and not try to shape the culture to what you are used to.

There was a girl that I was friendly with (I wouldn’t call us friends but I did see her pretty often) I had known her for around 2.5-3 years when out of nowhere, she started hitting on me. At first my confidence was way up, but I wasn’t interested in anything more. I stayed polite and friendly, but tried not to show too much interest. Well, she eventually asked me out. I tried to decline politely but she didn’t give me any way to get out of it without being an ass. Eventually I agreed to meet her for supper. We met, talked, had a good time but I still wasn’t interested in anything more. She kept insisting on going on dates with me, not taking no for an answer. So, I had to start being short with her.

"f5rwnb3","when i was younger we had a German Shepard dog that my father loved doing agility and obedience training with. naturally this also influenced the way i deal with training. however the downside was the immense amount of shedding, so i already knew that wasn't a choice for us. He also wanted a good to train dog to be a guard dog for us when we were little, and GSD was a great choice for this. Sadly he got old and had terrible arthritis and was put down around 13 years.

when we decided on a beagle we were very adamant on being able to take him out 2 - 3 times a day. we live very active lives around the hill side, with a lot of walking around in between. i adore agility training and general obedience training from my previous learnings with my dad, but i didn't want an oversized or over-shedding dog that could easily overpower me. their coat is short, and the weather here is warm in the summer months, chilly in winter but can be dealt with raincoats. beagles have very playful and cheeky temperaments and this is generally how our household is day to day, so we have been extremely happy with our choice.

heres a thing to consider. try to find out the original purpose of the dog's breed. that way you can reduce the possibilities of your dog developing issues that arise from being incompatible to your family's lifestyle.

st-bernards being a larger dog breed &amp; working around injured people, are more lazy and docile. they are great dogs for families with young children and deal well with snow. Additionally to this, because of their breeding to deal with injured people, they are gentle natured dogs that don't show much aggression.

the downsides to alaskan malamutes and irish wolfhounds is that they are very active &amp; have high prey drives. both were originally bred to be working dogs (malamute being a sled dog, irish wolfhound being a war dog). both breeds will most likely need 2 walks a day, rather than one, plus some cardio work. irish wolfhounds have high prey drive and can develop aggression issues so your family should be prepared for some early training to help with this problem. Alaskan malamutes are also known to be big howlers.... so it can bother some neighbours.

american bullies on the other hand, don't deal well with snow and need extra warmth. but the strong point is that they are wonderful family dogs and very loyal. they are highly protective breed, making great guard dogs. aggressive tendencies can be lowered a lot by early socialization and good training. they are active, but will happilly laze around their favorite people.

some other suggestions would be samoyed ( adorable, playful, cuddly and very family friendly, but high energy) doberman ( very loyal, good for training, good guard dogs, have active lifestyles but will happilly laze around their fave person), bernese mountain dog (cuddly, lovely family dogs but was original bred for farm work, so needs lots of exercise and training), border collies(very loving dogs, same as bernese, they were originally bred for farm work). 

i think at the end, goldendoogles, labs and golden retrievers are basically the best option for you guys. they are like easy mode breed haha....if you put in the work of course! they are the perfect candidate for most families. plus they have the coat to be able to be protected from the weather, and love to please so training is a breeze.",1572404786,"alaskan malamutes are also known to be big howlers.... so it can bother some neighbours.  american bullies on the other hand, don't deal well with snow and need extra warmth. but the strong point is that they are wonderful family dogs and very loyal. they are highly protective breed, making great guard dogs. aggressive tendencies can be lowered a lot by early socialization and good training. they are active, but will happilly laze around their favorite people.  some other suggestions would be samoyed ( adorable, playful, cuddly and very family friendly, but high energy) doberman ( very loyal, good for training, good guard dogs, have active lifestyles but will happilly laze around their fave person), bernese mountain dog (cuddly, lovely family dogs but was original bred for farm work, so needs lots of exercise and training), border collies(very loving dogs, same as bernese, they were originally bred for farm work).   i think at the end, goldendoogles, labs and golden retrievers are basically the best option for you guys. they are like easy mode breed haha....if you put in the work of course!","friendly, but high","friendly","but",TRUE,"friendly , but high","high",NA,NA,1

Before we even start looking at strategies, let’s clear up a common mistake most people make, which is thinking that being introverted and being shy are the same thing.

Are you an introvert or are you shy?  What are extroverts like?
The difference between being introverted and being shy is where we get our energy from, how we recharge our brains.
Introverts enjoy time alone and are emotionally drained after spending a lot of time with others.  A shy person doesn’t necessarily want to be alone but is afraid to interact with others.
You can seek therapy for shyness but not for introversion.  In fact, introverts are not all shy and sometimes have great social skills, it’s just that after participating in social activities, introverts are emotionally drained.  They become tired at group gatherings where they need to be “on” for a long time.  Their social energy is limited.  Introverts are not shy, they simply find it tiring to be around others.
Introverts enjoy time alone, in fact, that’s how they recharge and re-energize themselves.
Introverts tend to have excellent concentration and prefer to dive into one task at a time.
Introverts think before they speak and are often good listeners.
For introverts, being alone with their thoughts is as restorative as sleeping and as nourishing as eating.
Introverts are upset by unexpected changes or last-minute surprises.
Extroverts gain energy from other people and their energy is drained by spending a lot of time alone.  
Shy people fear being judged by others.  They are afraid of social disapproval or humiliation.  An introvert will turn down going to a party because it drains them of energy.  A shy person will turn down an invitation out of fear.
Shyness is a response, not a state of being, unlike introversion. 
When shyness prevents someone from living the life they want, they need to seek help from a psychologist.
Introverts are not afraid of speaking in public or having leadership roles.  For example, Bill Gates, Abraham Lincoln, and Gandhi are classified as introverts.

Then what is social anxiety?

Social anxiety is shyness times a thousand.  It’s a phobia, an overwhelming fear.  The National Institute of Mental Health estimates there are 15 million Americans who have social anxiety disorder.  
No one knows the cause, but it can run in families, which suggests it may be genetic.
It’s absolutely vital you seek help if you suspect you suffer from social anxiety because it is often accompanied by depression.  Cognitive behavioral therapy is very helpful in treating social anxiety, as are anti-anxiety medications and antidepressants.

What’s the difference between being shy and having social anxiety?

Feelings and nervousness in shy people subside as they become familiar with people or situations, whereas they not only do not subside but can worsen in people with social anxiety. 
Many people who have social anxiety do not consider themselves shy.  They can be talkative and friendly, but inside they’re struggling with anxious thoughts.
Socially anxious people over-analyze everything, re-enact past situations over and over, criticizing themselves or agonize over future events, imagining how horrible they’ll feel, certain that everyone will notice how uncomfortable they are.

Strategies for Overcoming Shyness and Living your BEST LIFE

Act as if.  Confidence comes through experience, learning, practice and discovering your self-worth and what your talents are.  Meanwhile, ACT AS IF you’re confident, then do that thing that terrifies you.  When you go for it, try it and you do well, you’ll feel REAL confidence and every time you bravely face your fear of interacting with others and stop avoiding it, you’ll feel a sense of accomplishment that will accumulate towards developing real self-confidence.
Take every opportunity to engage with others: ordering at a coffee shop, in line at the supermarket, and working out at the gym to make small talk with strangers.  “So, have you tried the cold brew?  Would you recommend it?  Does it make you jittery from so much caffeine?” or “That’s a cute notebook you’re buying, are you an office supply addict like me?” or “Hey, could you help me?  I’ve gone up to 10 lbs on this machine, when should I go a little higher?”
Try things you’ve always wanted to try but haven’t because the thought of putting yourself out there makes you anxious: a dance class, swimming, learning a language, joining a book club, going on a wine tasting experience.  You can’t overcome shyness if you don’t step out of your comfort zone.  There is no growth within the zone.  However, if you do things despite your anxiety, fear of failure, rejection or humiliation, you’re staring your fears in the face and every time you do so will be a success, an accomplishment and every accomplishment will lead to overcoming your shyness.
Be more talkative in social or work situations.  Practice being more expressive with friends, strangers, and colleagues and soon you’ll notice you’re less anxious every time you do it.  Act confident.  Confident people aren’t agonizing over what everyone is going to think about them.  Act as if and eventually it’ll become a reality.
Be comfortable being vulnerable.  The biggest reason why you’re shy and/or socially anxious is fear of what others will think or say about you.  Fear of being judged.  Practice first with friends and people close to you.  The more you do it, the more confidence you’ll acquire and the more natural it’ll feel.  Be genuine, be vulnerable, you’re not the first shy person people have met.  Stop overthinking things and playing scenarios in your head of things that you assume people will be thinking about you.  
Be present in every moment.  Stop and be aware of your thoughts and feelings.  Observe them with curiosity: “Huh, I’m feeling anxious just because I’m going to order coffee.  That’s interesting because there’s no reason to be anxious.”  Don’t judge your thoughts or feelings.  Don’t beat yourself up over them: “Ugh, I’m getting nervous again, I’m such an idiot!”  Stop.  Just observe and pay attention to each moment: “Wow, my heart rate accelerated just because that guy looked at me. I’m going to look back at him and smile, get another success under my belt.”
The moment your inner critic starts talking to you, put a stop to it.  You have the power to stop negative self-talk by immediately turning negative thoughts into real.  When that inner voice starts with, “Everybody is going to turn around and look at me when I go into the coffee shop and then they’ll know I’m anxious because….blah...blah...blah.”  Immediately turn it around, “Some people will turn to look when I come in because they hear the door open and they’re bored, with nothing to do in line. They’re not thinking about me.  They have their own problems and personal drama to think of.”  
Be real.  You’re not shy in every aspect of your life.  Make a list of all the situations where you’re comfortable.  It’s important that you realize that your shyness is not something insurmountable.  Look at the list of all the places, people, and situations that don’t make you anxious.  Now make a list of situations that trigger your shyness. This is going to be your list of goals to conquer.

We just have different priorities here: We value getting places quickly and understand that people don't want to be bothered. We're respectful of that fact when we: 

1) Don't hold up a long food or coffee line by chatting up the cashier

2) Don't chat up people on the T, etc. 

3) Don't stop in crowded spaces to chat people up.

I'm an absurdly friendly, extroverted person, and I still understand and agree with this. You're letting people deal with their own business and get on with their day.

What I do try to do to be friendly but quick is: thank my T driver when I get on (and off, if there's no one talking to them as I'm getting off) and tipping at places like Dunkin Donuts. Also if I stop to talk to somebody, I make sure we move out of the way of people walking by.

"f1k4fns","I suspect it could be that you are really angry at yourself for not standing up for yourself. Being a jerk generally isn't the answer (once in a awhile, you do need to be an asshole, mainly when you are dealing with someone who is already being one).

The answer isn't to go to either extreme - being a pushover or a complete jerk. Like many things in life the answer is somewhere in the middle. It sounds to me like you just need to learn assertiveness. I would explore that more.

When you learn to be assertive, it is easier to be nice where you need to be, because you know you can start being more aggressive if you need to be.

Just as an example, when I call customer service to fix a problem, I'm going to be friendly, remember that the problem isn't their fault, and start with the assumption that the person is going to help. And with that additude they usually do. I am friendly but also direct. But if they aren't resolving my problem, I start to push back. But you don't just flip out and be a jerk. It needs to be a proportional response based on the situation. That can be a bit more tricky. 

I like this quote from Jordan Peterson : 

""I think that if you're resentful something is definitely wrong. Either you need to grow the hell up and take stock of your life or you have some things to say to people that you haven't been saying."" 

When I'm mad about something I try to think ""Am I being unreasonable? Is it possible that I'm just being lazy or ungrateful? Is it possible that I misinterpreted the situation?""

If I think about it and decide that I have been wronged somehow, then at that point I absolutely have to say or do something, because otherwise I will resent myself for not speaking up, and that resentment will start to bubble up in other places.

If you can, it helps to write it down. Write a letter to the person who wronged you. You don't need to send it, just get it out of your head and see if it sounds reasonable. If you can sleep on it, so much the better.

Oftentimes the next day I will decide that I AM being unreasonable, which basically solves the problem - I don't need to resent the other person, and if nothing needs to be said, I don't need to resent myself for not saying it.",1569531664,"i am friendly but also direct.","friendly but also","friendly","but",FALSE,"friendly but also direct","direct",NA,"also",1

"f0eihu7","**Pros:**  
*Minneapolis has a diverse, stable economy which means that it typically has lower unemployment rates than the rest of the country. When there are economic downturns, Minneapolis tends to be less effected and bounces back more quickly.  
*Compared to most other large, desirable cities, Minneapolis is still comparatively affordable. People who have lived here for a long time will complain that it is not affordable to live here anymore, but that's just because they have nothing to compare it to. Coming from Seattle, you'll probably find it laughably cheap to live here. While I wouldn't consider Minneapolis to be cheap, I definitely consider it to still be a good value at the moment.   
*It's a pleasant lifestyle. You will have access to many urban parks and lakes very close to you, no matter where you live in the city. People are generally very pleasant with each other in their day to day interactions. Most people attempt to avoid conflict when possible. Some people criticize that as passive-aggressive (and there is no shortage of passive aggressiveness here), however I'll take passive aggressive over aggressive aggressive any day of the week. As a rule, people tend to be well educated. It's also a clean city. Minneapolis grew up around food production and river port shipping, so there isn't as much of the heavy industry polluting up the city or in decay like many other midwestern cities.  

**Cons:**  
*Winter. I know you mentioned it, but you can't know how you'll respond to it until you've lived through it. It'll take you a few years to get used to it and it does drive quite a few people away. That said, the summers and autumns here are incredible, but simply too short.  
*No mountains, no ocean. Most people that move here from areas with easy mountain and ocean access really miss it. There is something to be said for having large and awe inspiring experiences available to you in your daily life. There is plenty of natural beauty in Minneapolis, but it's more subtle. It is pretty flat here. It's not Chicago flat or Florida flat, but don't expect much elevation change in or around the city. Lake Superior is about a 2-3 hour drive from Minneapolis, and that will be as close to an ocean experience as you will get here.   
*If you eat seafood now, be prepared that it won't be nearly as good here. There are a lot of places that try their best and do a good job, but we are a long way from the ocean and there's only so much you can do.  

**Making friends:**  
I don't think that it's as difficult to make friends here as it was 10+ years ago. In the last decade, there have been a lot of people moving here from other areas chasing the affordable living and good paying jobs. If you target other transplants and focus your energies there, you'll be fine.  

That said, it is difficult to make friends with the people who were born and raised here. Those people tend to never leave, so their social calendars tend to be full with family and life long friends. My spouse has worked at the same place for 25 years, but we almost never have social events with co-workers simply because free time is spent with people she's known for her entire life. Also, I do think that there's a strong undercurrent of the Protestant work ethic ingrained in the culture here. Work is for working and the best way to get work done is by being pleasant and friendly, but not having deep personal relationships with co-workers that can complicate business if relationships sour. That's just my anecdotal experience and theory, though.",1568568942,"work is for working and the best way to get work done is by being pleasant and friendly, but not having deep personal relationships with co-workers that can complicate business if relationships sour.","pleasant and friendly","friendly",NA,FALSE,"pleasant and friendly","pleasant",NA,NA,0

"f0eg5gn","Hey, thanks for following up, it sounds like a not-so-happy time and I just wanted to send some words of encouragement.

I live in a big city, and my daughter just started at a nearby school. It's pretty dense where I am, and the number of families with kids is quite high, so this elementary school with 2 or 3 classes per school year only serves an area of a few blocks. Like everyone who goes there can walk there in less than 10 minutes. And it is *amazing* how good, friendly, supportive and involved most of the parents are. Like at least 75% of the families seem super nice. This is in Montreal, where there is a very low percentage of religious adherence, and in a part of Montreal that is very permissive and left-leaning, politically. It's also extremely multi-cultural, there are folks of all colours and ethnicities, with all kinds of languages spoken in the kids' homes.  I think the community is probably the sort of people with the sort of beliefs that many strongly isolationist religions would not expect to be so friendly. And yet, it is a really welcoming community. The parents' committees at the schools are super involved and thoughtful.

I've never lived anywhere really rural or spread out, I've almost always lived in cities (including in the US at times). So I don't know for sure what I'm talking about. But I imagine that there is sometimes a discomfort, in people from rural and homogeneous communities, with being around a lot of people that are different from you in a dense city environment. Then, when young adults manage to get out and come to a diverse city and meet people from different backgrounds, they are amazed that they can be welcomed.

You say that the people in your faith are friendly. But would they continue to be friendly and supportive if you admitted questioning your faith and you said you wanted to experience some other aspects of the world and socialise with people of different backgrounds? I don't know for sure. I'm sure they love you in their way, but that's not the only way to love someone.

All that to say I hope you don't feel too afraid to venture outside your congregation socially. Even if you are a loner you can find friends if, for example, you go off to college somewhere bigger, or just move to a city and meet people. If the folks in your congregation have helped make you a nicer person, then you will find it not hard to have other kinds of people want to hang out with you too, because they will find you likable too, with or without any religious question. But you probably need to increase the number of people you meet socially to find out for yourself what it's like to be around people who aren't of the same background as you, and to teach yourself that you don't *need* to only be friends with people who have a very similar background to you. And yes, among all the people you meet who are different from you, you will meet many more assholes than you would ever have met in your own community. But you will also meet really good people who you will value each other not just because of a shared religion.

I actually work at a university, where I teach music, and all the time I see 18- or 19-year-old kids moving here from all over and making new friendships very quickly based on music and other things they love, from really different backgrounds.

I wish you good luck, and don't believe anyone who says you have to reject your own community in order to talk to anyone from outside about anything you want to, and to explore other religious ideas or even the possibility of having a lack of religious ideas. I went from being brought up casually Christian as a child, to having no religious beliefs one way or the other.",1568567883,"but would they continue to be friendly and supportive if you admitted questioning your faith and you said you wanted to experience some other aspects of the world and socialise with people of different backgrounds?","friendly and supportive","friendly",NA,FALSE,"friendly and supportive","supportive",NA,NA,1

I know this sounds bad but hear me out. 

New neighbours moved in a month back - they've got a very poorly trained jack russel/foxy terrier cross. Small dog, super cute and friendly but listens to nobody. 

There's been a couple occasions when he got into my yard and my cat scratched him up (she's tiny, but an absolute little warrior and is good at picking her battle grounds, so took care of him fairly easily). First time he got in, I visited them and explained that it's for the best if he doesn't have access to my property, due to afore mentioned cat. They apologized, said it wouldn't happen again, and that was that. 

Second time it happened, my cat hurt him a little worse and they asked if I'd pay the vet check up bill. I said no, reminded them that he shouldn't be on my property (which is fully fenced and has a gate, I actually have no idea how he got in but it seems he's never contained on his own section as he basically spends all his time running loose)


Anyway, I also have 2 bunnies both of whom I love very much. Earlier this morning, as I was leaving for work, I found him in my backyard trying to catch the rabbits. I rushed to help just as he got hold of one of them, and acting instinctively, booted him with a sweeping motion that threw him up and over the fence. Really stupid move on my part as he had hold of my rabbits ear so that's now been torn and he'll need stitches. 

Anyway, neighbours lost their shit and made all sorts of threats. I feel like they now owe me for my rabbit's vet costs, and need to take responsibility for their pet.

So, here are some pointers:
-People who like you will want to stare into your eyes. Not just look, stare. Hold their gaze, let them see that you are looking at them too. If they hold it for 7 seconds, that can be evidence enough they like you. 
-Flirting can be friendly, but physical flirting rarely is. If he says you're pretty, it could be a friendly thing. So, flirt back, but physically. If he does not like you, he won't reciprocate. If he does, he will. Hugging him, a playful touch of the arm after a joke, laughing at his jokes, etc, they are all standards, and will get the message across.
-At the end of the day, see how you feel about him, and if you like him, tell him. Make it romantic, and even if he doesn't like you, there's a chance after that he might start to. 

Also, whilst I don't advocate cheating, young relationships are rarely serious. So even if he has ''a girl'', they may just be friends who hold hands and little more, so it's not entirely wrong for you two to pursue something else if you have something stronger.

I’ve replayed S1 a handful of times and I’ve never been able to resist Jake. He’s just the best.

"eufa8cl","So this year I went to the Australian Grand Prix, which was the first GP I've attended.   


Traveling to Australia

I traveled to it with one of my friends from the northeastern United States. We flew from there to Los Angeles (LAX) and then flew from LAX to Melbourne Airport (MEL), also known as Tullamarine. Going from LAX to MEL was a 15 1/2 hour flight there and 14 1/2 back.  While a long flight, Qantas' service was quite good, being a close second to Cathy Pacific and far better then my trans-pacific experiences with JAL and American. The sheer variety of entertainment options combined with an attentive and friendly but unobtrusive cabin staff and good food made a long-flight much more comfortable. 

&amp;#x200B;

Melbourne Airport

Upon arriving at MEL, I found the airport itself to be easy to navigate, with the biggest holdups being retrieving checked luggage. The Australian Customs Officers also seem very professional and friendly.  After clearing Customs, we stopped by the Vodaphone store at the Airport (it's right outside of the exit of customs). There we picked up a Sim Card that came with 45GB of Data, 500 International minutes, and was good for 35 days. This only cost us 20AUD due to it being on sale. The normal cost was 40AUD. Once doing this, we then bought a pair of round trip Skybus tickets, which were 38AUD each. We then were able to take the Skybus from Melbourne direct to Southern Cross Station downtown, which was about a 30 minute ride.

&amp;#x200B;

Lodging and Getting Around Melbourne

We chose to take the cheap option of getting a shared 4 person dorm room at the United Backpackers Hostel directly across from Flinders Street Station. This cost 35AUD a night and put us at the southern end of the downtown core. The track itself is in St. Kilda and was about a 30 minute tram ride from where we stayed. On the days of qualifying and the race, the tram was free to take to Albert Park. Also, within the downtown core, there is always a free tram zone, so it is very easy to get around the city as well.  If one wanted to stay closer to the track, there are many options for hostels and hotels in St. Kilda within walking distance of the track.   


The Australian GP Experience

The Grand Prix itself was a fantastic experience. The crowd energy is very high and its a very well run event. We had bought our Grandstand tickets back in November, and this gave us GP Advantage Silver status. I strongly recommend taking advantage of this. It gave us access to a more private area directly across from the pits near the start/finish line. This area contained an indoor area to get out of the sun and heat, a shaded porch, a area with beanbag chairs in front of a big screen TV, and access to reasonably priced food and restrooms with short lines.  I was able to grab 5 dumplings and 2 steamed buns for 10AUD as an example.   


As for our seats during the race, we had front row seats in the Senna Grandstands, right at the exit of Turn 16 into the Pit Straight.  I would actually recommend getting seats at least halfway up the grandstands, as the fencing obscured my view the track and the big screen somewhat.  Also, the higher up one was, the more you could see into Turn 15 as well. This is really my only complaint about the whole experience, and would write it off to my own lack of experience.   


Outside of the F1 race itself, the Australian Grand Prix has lot going on. In terms of on-track action, you also have the following: Australian GT (Race-prepped supercars), SuperCars Championship (V8 powered silhouette racers), Ferrari Challenge, Porsche Carrera Cup, and Australian Formula 4. They also had a V10 powered Minardi two-seater chase down a race-prepped Hyundai touring car, and the road car it was based on.  On Saturday and Sunday, the Royal Australian Air Force also did a F/A-18 flight demonstration directly over the track. Additionally, when we walked around to the General Admission zone on the backside of the race, we found people showing off there cars. Virtually every performance car make and model was present, with particularly strong showings from the JDM, Holden, and Ford crowds.  


Final Thoughts  
The Australian Grand Prix was a great time. Melbourne is a modern cosmopolitan city with much to do outside the race, especially if one likes good food, parks, and museums. Staying at a hostel in downtown Melbourne, we got to meet fellow F1 fans from many different places and had easy access to the city too. The event itself is very well run, with a packed schedule and great energy.",1563767228,"the sheer variety of entertainment options combined with an attentive and friendly but unobtrusive cabin staff and good food made a long-flight much more comfortable.   &amp;#x200b;  melbourne airport  upon arriving at mel, i found the airport itself to be easy to navigate, with the biggest holdups being retrieving checked luggage.","attentive and friendly","friendly",NA,FALSE,"friendly but unobtrusive","unobtrusive",NA,NA,1

"etx31qe","I grew up in Augsburg and had a real good time there, I‘ll try to answer your questions - as well, everybody is individual, so it‘s just my point of view 😄

1) Why is Augsburg good or bad

It‘s good because, you allready mentioned, it‘s not too big and not too small. I really dislike that some of the people are really unfriendly - but there‘re also a lot of people very open and friendly - but there‘s nothing in between...

2) Best way to find job and apartment

For an apartment the Augsburger Allgemeine Newspaper or online portals are your friend, for a job depends for what you‘re looking for.

For traditional jobs directly check out the local locations and ask there. Most companies got their open job vacancy on their website as well.

3) Is it expensive

No. Compared to the co-location Munich or Nuremberg it‘s ok.

4) Is it a safe city

Yes. There‘re districts which are not (like Oberhausen or partially Lechhausen - but all in all it‘s safe.

5) Expected pay

It depends, but I guess it should start at about 20.000€ / year

6) Fun

Yes, there a couple of clubs in Augsburg City (Maximilianstr) - for electronic music there‘re a lot of clubs and bars you‘ll feel well

7) Things to do

"esy3isg","This happened to a supervisor of mine once. It was clearly obvious after she got her promotion that Little Ms. Suckup as we dubbed a fellow coworker was pulling the whole, ""But we are friendddddssss!"" routine on her.

And my supervisor handled it like a champ. She was gracious and friendly, BUT she tailored anything said to her to include the whole team. So if Ms. Suckup loudly asked her, ""Can we do lunch tomorrow"" my supervisor would say, ""That's a wonderful idea, I'd love to have a staff lunch where everyone can input their ideas on this new project we'll be getting. Let me check my calendar on that and see what I can do, no promises though."" OR ""I'm very busy right now on X project, but let's all have a brief meeting in the morning to go over anything each of you might be having on the Y project."" She might then later send around a memo asking everyone to put it in writing in the meantime.

Whatever this woman brought up got turned into a team thing or to include other coworkers. It was brilliant and it deflated Ms. Suckup after awhile, because a) she couldn't use the whole ""You feel you are better than us because you got promoted"" when she was including everyone and b) it was a very subtle hint of the Ms. Suckup you are not the only one who needs or deserves my attention"" variety. When Ms. Suckup tried to monopolize work conversations or interject herself she'd hold up her hand and say things like, ""Karen, thank you for the input, but I  need to listen to Dan now so please let him speak."" 

After awhile it became very apparent that Little Ms. Suckup was not a favorite, was trying to be a favorite, and that our supervisor didn't play favorites. Ever.

-The lack of general education in people, not in manners but in information, sometimes even basic stuff.
-The amount of homeless and also amount of empty buildings at the same time..
-The makeup in girls.. the orange faces, the fake eye lashes, the amount of shet on their faces.. and the way they dress.. Never seen in any other country 14 year old KIDS dressing like call girls.

Sure, there have people who, on a personal level, I’ve had nothing in common with. There have been occasional dicks who I’ve steered clear of. But for the most part I’ve enjoyed working (across 4 cities, and 4 different companies) with people who have been keen to teach and train and support others (be it for altruistic or entirely selfish reasons). I’m on the buy side these days and I’ve been impressed at the collegiate atmosphere.

One thing I’ve been very focused on though is finding firms with ‘no dickhead’ hiring policies (indeed, one hiring manager was particularly upfront about that), and a corporate culture that fits my own. I’ve definitely walked away from interviews thinking xyz firm is too ‘bro-ey’, cutthroat, hierarchical etc. I tend to focus on finding people who are nerdy and passionate about their field, and not just in it for the $. Those are my people.

This was one throw away part of your comment that struck me. Because I do need to take an interest in others in the office. My job is to make specific investment recommendations - and when I break that down my job is to be a) right, b) have someone listen to me in the first place. That means cultivating a friendly but professional relationship with my coworkers. I’m not going to hang out with my colleagues outside the office, I’m not going to get drawn into anything too personal in their lives, but asking how their kid’s college applications are going, their mother’s operation went, their vacation was, etc was helps us all feel a bit less like robots and more like a team.

Not really honestly. You just have to go to a gun range, take your ""French Sport Shooting Federation"" licence, and you can buy shotgun, bolt action, or lever action rifle.

"eqzk37u","""Trust but verify"" is a phrase originally popularized from the Reagan administration to describe nuclear disarmament relations with the Soviet Union. The fact of the matter is the US did not truly trust the Soviet Union and the first part of that phrase is describing a disposition. It's a diplomatic way of saying act cordial and friendly but also reinforce the mandated verification process we have because we know we can't trust this nation that is our active foe. 

So, no, you cannot truly trust someone if you are going to be subjecting them to focused scrutiny. If I ask my friend to wash the dishes, I don't feel the need to check on her because at this point in our relationship I trust that she did it. The point of trust is that I don't ***need*** confirmation. I could have it and that's fine but it's not a requirement for me to continue to maintain my relationship in good faith. 

And, no I don't mind paternity tests in general. I think they are just a tool and like any tool they can be used well or used poorly. 

Yes, I view the mandatory and ubiquitous implementation of them as a standard for having children to be misogynistic. But it's not because a problem has to be widespread and endemic, as I stated before the inherent motivation for the misogyny is a distrust of women. I just don't see how that notion is in any way uncoupled from the active need for this law. Like with your debit card example, if we trusted people to behave then we wouldn't have the law. In this case, we are saying women can't be trusted to behave so now we have to make it mandatory. I'm saying that this mistrust treats the situation like it is endemic and widespread, not that it is the necessary criteria to implement the law. 

If it makes it easier for you, if the situation were such that this was a widespread problem, I would be more empathetic to the notion of wanting this law but I would still hold my original objection. I find this whole conversation distasteful because all it does it pit men and women against each other and I think it'd be a step backwards that we institutionalize that in our culture via the law.",1560401413,"it's a diplomatic way of saying act cordial and friendly but also reinforce the mandated verification process we have because we know we can't trust this nation that is our active foe.","cordial and friendly","friendly",NA,FALSE,"cordial and friendly","cordial",NA,NA,0

I was at a friend's place and there was a guy there who clung to me the whole night. He had a weird vibe and initially he approached me when I was suuuuper drunk. I got a weird feeling so I just tried to keep friendly but brief conversation when he'd talk to me to hopefully show I wasn't interested.

&amp;nbsp;

Nearly everyone else left towards the end of the night. I had a good friend who had passed out and locked himself in the bathroom and I wanted to make sure he was ok, so I stayed. Also, I actually had a huge crush on my other friend at the time and when I sobered up a bit, I decided to stay so I could maybe hang out and play a game with him. He ended up too tired and fell asleep. I thought my creeper dude had left but as soon as my friend fell asleep, there he was.

&amp;nbsp;

The rest of the night, he chased me around the house, pinned me down, tickled me into submission, and would pull my pants down. I kept trying to get away from him but he'd just grab me a proceed. Something that stuck out to me was him saying, ""I've never met a girl so difficult before."" 

&amp;nbsp;

He kept up this ordeal so in the end, I stopped fighting it and he assaulted me in the guest bedroom- but, fell asleep before he could rape me. 

&amp;nbsp;

I stayed friends with the person whose place I was at and the other person locked in the bathroom, but only for a short period afterward. Creepy dude had convinced everyone that we were dating and every time I'd go to hang out with my friends, they'd ""give us space"" 🙄 and leave.

I didn't want to cause problems or make a scene.

Later, I became friends with a few other people in the group and learned that my best friend had been convinced we were dating and the girls had all had similar experiences with the same guy(he actually told me he had dated them too).

I myself prior to goin vegan was a pescetarian for about 8 months, but i just couldn't live with that double standard anymore. It was impossible to say to claim that I am doing this for ethical reasons, I had an excuse to only murder specific beings, and that looking back was disgusting. 

About vegans eating ramen. If they do they're not vegan by definition, even if it's a side product like gelatin.

About your irritation with vegans harming the environment. Without going into specifics, a kilo of milk would harm the environment more than a kilo of plants. The definition of veganism doesn't directly include being environmentally friendly, but many still strive for that. Thus I can't say they are doing much more wrong than an average human on the planet.

How and where did I try to belittle your effort friend? It does take effort, the culture, the social pressure, I've been through it. But the final transition would be easier then you think, believe me. 

To be transparent, I assume you mean the word 'excuse' was disrespectful here. That is technically what people have when they are vegetarian, it's generally either veganism being too hard for them or vegans being evil, arrogant freaks, the latter I see more commonly. I am not taking my words back, as i do not see why I should've used a euphemism for 'excuse' if that is what it technically is. 

Again, I do not see how you all saw my question offensive, I really tried my best not to use the 'vegan language', which many in my place probably would. It's really hard not to btw.

"enrnevg","Do not delude yourself into thinking your identity is defined by a significant other. I was guilty of this in my early 20s, felt that my validation as a person was through them. Accept that women wont return your affections, wont return your calls or texts, and wont tell you they don’t like you outright. I know it sucks to put yourself out there for someone and them act awkward about it or ghost you or try and play it off, but thats because our society with relationships doesn’t often promote honesty. The best endings to things I’ve had is when people go, “thanks for dinner, but I didnt feel a connection.  Best of luck” because its honest. It always hurts a little to the ego, but its life. 

The second thing is to not invest yourself so quickly. I am fully guilty of talking to someone and when she’s friendly towards me I immediately think 15 steps ahead because I think she kinda likes me and I start thinking about how awesome it would be to have her as a girlfriend, etc. etc. People are friendly, but it doesn’t always mean anything.

The last and most hard pieces of advice here, is be up front and assertive. The r/NiceGuys  problem is that they try to act like a knight in shining armor, who doesn’t share his feelings, and constantly are being overly helpful and friendly. This is how men put themselves in the friend zone. Being friendly and helpful is still required, but accept that you are a man with feeling and you need to have your needs in a relationship met too. But r/NiceGuys don’t do this, and hence why they explode when their affection isn’t returned — because they mask their affection in helpful acts of service and don’t communicate. 

Communication is the ultimate tool, be honest with how you feel, and know that you will be rejected, it will suck every time it happens but its not unique. If you like someone, let them know, and if they don’t return the feelings - its up to you if you want to try and have a platonic relationship or no relationship.",1558017700,"the r/niceguys  problem is that they try to act like a knight in shining armor, who doesn’t share his feelings, and constantly are being overly helpful and friendly.","helpful and friendly","friendly",NA,FALSE,"overly helpful and friendly","helpful",NA,"overly",0

"enrigkl","I was working as a teenager for the Goshen (Indiana) Parks and Recreation Dept. in 1989 as a neighborhood playground leader, gaining experience in leadership with children before heading to Ball State to major in elementary education.  One of the many games we played was good old-fashioned object Frisbee Golf, and I had played that myself with Wham-O Fastbacks and whatnot going as far back as 4th grade.    


Coincidentally, Oxbow Park's course with sparkling new Mach III's went in the ground that year, also the same year I got my driver's license.  


Our park superintendent mentioned this at a meeting and I had to try this out, so I embarked on this adventure with my big Wham-O play catch Frisbee.  The course, by the way, was made way easier 7 years later when the PDGA worlds came in 1996.  So the 1989 version was BRUTAL.  Poison ivy, thorns, 600' long holes with multiple tight doglegs, a 500'+ hole running parallel with a river only ten feet off the fairway.  It was all I knew.  Nearby was George Wilson Park, much more open and friendly, but I wouldn't know about it for years because (a) no internet, (b) I almost never saw another person playing at Oxbow.    


After awhile, I eventually ran into the course designer, who I'd discover many years later was PDGA #315.  He sold me my first Disc out of his garage, a Stingray, the first version right after the amoeba stamp that was produced for a solid ten years or so.  Super nice guy.  He was probably in his sixties at the time and threw lots of stuff we'd deem as artifacts now.  He was really the only source of getting a real Disc.  I would lose that yellow 172g Stingray with a flashing red circle stamp that summer in what seemed to be an acre of poison ivy at Oxbow.  


I went to Ball State only owning a Stingray (this time a 1992 PDGA doubles stamp with the dinosaurs), a chains Aviar, and a few other Discs I couldn't throw well (a Roc, a Cobra, a Viper and a Whippet).  I routinely used my Wham-O 150 for golf!  No courses closer than Indianapolis there (and I had no car), still hardly anybody knowing what the sport was (I DID see one group of guys throwing in the quad one time in four years).    


I married my girlfriend (we still are married) and we moved to East Lansing in 1995 so she could do grad school at MSU.  The next April, when I started working for the Lansing Boys and Girls Club at night to supplement substitute teaching during the day, a coworker there asked if I'd like to come try ""Frisbee Golf"" at Grand Woods Park.    


I took my Stingray that I could RHFH with a little light flick straight ahead 200' and instantly was hooked on this course.     


My wife and I one week later would accidentally lock our keys in our car there.  Since this was before cell phones we walked to the nearest driveway across the road with a bunch of cars on it and asked to use their telephone.  A nice lady there obliged, and when we asked in small talk why so many cars were there, it was because it was Mushin Muhammad's house and it was the 1996 NFL draft day.  How cool is that?!  The Carolina Panthers took him later that evening.

I've had people kill me and then they allowed my buddy to come in, revive me and allowed us to leave.

Once more people do, you'll start seeing more ""shit talking"" and toxicity grow simply because the community is growing. It's the way anonymity works. It brings out ""the best"" in people ;)

Best thing you can do is have recording software going and if you experience racism, hate speech or true toxicity (""git gud scrub"" type of stuff isn't report level toxic imo) then you can report them to Crytek and submit your evidence.

"ejx1sq1","First off... congrats on putting on the stripes!! Please feel free to send me a message any time.  I am happy to provide advice, feedback, or even just a person to vent to.  Never hesitate.

I have a couple of thoughts with newer officials dealing with difficult coaching staffs.  Here's some things to ponder...

- Use your R.  He should be an experienced official and your advocate at all times.  During your pre-game, mention that you have had a negative history with this coach and ask what sort of line he wants to draw with the coaching staffs.  Your R should have the experience to be able to put together a gameplan.  Follow his lead so that you can be a united crew.  A good R will also take over when things get heated and deal with coaches.

- You are never permanently attached to a location on the field.  If you are having trouble ignoring the coach (if he's just annoying but not crossing any lines), ask to switch to Single Side for a little while.  There is absolutely nothing wrong with this.  If it is going to affect your officiating in any way, go take a break on single for a bit.  I actually had an instance where I (as R) ran Single for an entire quarter of a playoff game because the fans were INSUFFERABLE... I but the bullet for my crew and dealt with it for a while.  Be smart about it.

- Understand the difference between arguing the call and arguing with you.  ""Why is that not a push?"" is different than ""Why are you calling their pushes and not our pushes?"".  One is arguing the call on the field, the other is challenging your ability to do your job.  The first is reasonable form a head coach.  It often deserves at least an acknowledgment that their opinions are valid and that you'll watch for it in the future (my ""get out of jail"" statement is: ""I hear you coach.  I understand.  I will watch for that."" Works like 80% of the time).  The second deserves recourse.

- Remember to ""Ramp"" conduct punishment.  Hopefully this was part of your training.  Start with a warning.  Be simple and direct.  Something along the lines of, ""I've had enough from you coach.  No more.""  Be matter of fact and firm without being overly harsh.  Next is the conduct while his team has the ball/it's loose; just turn it over.  Then is the conduct when the other team has the ball; sit the in-home for 30.  Then you're at the 1 min USC.  Next is an ejection.  If the guy hasn't gotten the message by step 4, that's kinda on him.  Of course, if he does something outrageous you can skip all the way to step 4, but it sounds like this guy is more badgering than explosive.

- One last piece of advice.  NEVER throw both the USCs to eject someone from a game.  Let one of your partners take care of one of them.  But also be prepared to be the one who throws the second flag.  I threw a flag in a game (I was not the R) from SS to the far bench cause the coach was riding my partner at trail WAY too hard and was starting to get personal.  The Trail official had already flagged the coach earlier, so I took the bullet for the ejection.  It's much harder for a coach to blame a single official when two of them combine to eject them.

Overall.... it's all about respect.  Be respectful with all initial interactions with the coaches.  Shake their hands, be friendly but professional, and genuinely listen when they want to ask you something.  Respond to them and let them know that they are heard.  If you lead with that sort of behavior and then it is NOT reciprocated by the coach, then you are well within your rights to deal with it using the tools we have at our disposal.

"ej2s8q9","The best? It’s ok at best. The acting and production were great for me but the plot is just 1) so predictable it hurts 2) it’s so weird how Allison could’ve used her power to bypass a lot of the “problems” she had to deal with like Leonard as well as looking for Vanya when Vanya stayed at Leonard’s grandmothers place. The dialogue is also somewhat cheesy, almost as cheesy as the Star Wars prequels. Peach’s death is unfortunate as I think it would’ve helped Diego’s character a bit more if she survived but noo it’s gotta be another sad death that doesn’t much for the audience. Diego’s character is the worst. Klaus is the best. Speaking of Klaus however, his whole vietnam thing with his lover felt weird and out of place. 


In the beginning, the plot had potential to be something great for the show. Even the time travel aspect of things was pretty interesting. However, the plot wants to focus on so many incessant, and weird moments like the pointless love stories between the Donut grandma and friendly but deadly assassin. And I know that Allison and Luther aren’t biologically related, but the fact they grew up together from birth, and lived like siblings, it just feels weird for them to have romantic feelings between them. The arguments between Diego and Luther are insufferable like it’s sooo boring. Diego’s thing with Mom is also pretty boring and annoying too. 


The one thing that really disappoints me though is the ending of the show where our main characters didn’t even achieve what they had in the end. For some people, it was a cliffhanger, for me, it was a slap in the face and a waste of time.

First, try to not worry too much.

Another place you can stay are the hotels close to MOA- also known as Mall of Asia.  If you need last minute souvenirs before your floght MOA is the place to go, they surrounding hotels and casino hotels have free shuttles going towards the mall.

If you stay at one of the casino hotels, take advantage of the buffet restaurants.  Plus if something happens to your luggage - damaged, ripped, need a bigger one- MOA has a HUGE luggage section you can buy some in the cheap.

"eglspsv","I feel like Cygames is the most f2P friendly with both DL and GBF, whereas FGO is a bit harder to compare because it' has a different environment.

The main point of contention here is that FEH generally encourages players to roll for units that they otherwise aren't fond of. If I want to, say, use Lute in arena, I'll need to also worry about rolling for skills and merges to help maximize my scoring. Skill Inheritance is one of the most major components of FEH since close to launch, and it's simultaneously a f2P-friendly mechanic in that you can make most units work with the right skill, but also make things harder for f2P by locking skills behind limited 5 stars.

FGO lacks any form of PvP and focuses a lot more on grinding for progression. The gacha is cruel, but at the same time, low rarity/welfare servants are usually either really strong or fill an important niche of their own. As of late, DW has been making welfare variations of popular servants, which helps a bit with the game being f2p-friendly but harder to collect any servants you legitimately like that end up as 5 stars.

Cygames is just extraordinarily generous. To the point where they seem to look for excuses to gift players. I consider myself to be more of an FGO player, but Cygames really does take it when it comes to how it treats players. During the Winter season in GBF, players had 2 weeks of so of free rolls everyday (depending on what spot on the roulette you hit), while DL players were hit with a ton of summoning 10 fold vouchers/currency. 

Sniping in GBF is difficult due to the abysmal rateup (one thing FGO has above it in terms of summoming), but if you save enough, you can get almost anything in the gacha without RNG fucking you over. Filling out your grid is a process, but with GBF, you're pretty set by just dedicating time into it.

Not to demonize IS with FEH, but I wouldn't consider them more generous than certain other gacha. They do some good, but at the same time, encourage players to summon more as a means to fix some more annoying parts of FEH or progress their characters via merging.",1550335647,"as of late, dw has been making welfare variations of popular servants, which helps a bit with the game being f2p-friendly but harder to collect any servants you legitimately like that end up as 5 stars.","friendly but harder","friendly","but",FALSE,"friendly but hard","hard",NA,NA,1
"eg76rne","##Day 6,320,430:

Satan looked at me over his notes; a look of annoyance crossed his face. ""You've been here a while now. Longer than most everyone else.""

""Uh, yeah, I guess so.""

""And yet, somehow, you haven't lost your sanity?""

""I haven't? I guess I just assumed I had. That's strange.""

""No, no. According to this here, you're quite sane. See, when you go insane, we toss you into a cell and your mind tortures you for us. Saves time, you know, less messy, too."" A speculative tone enters his voice, ""has nothing today impacted you?""

I thought back, but my memory of the day is just a fuzzy boredom. ""I don't think so, no.""

""The toothpicks? The dragon? ... What about that interesting intestinal plague?""

""Dragon? No, I don't remember a dragon.""

Confused, ""what do you mean you don't remember a dragon? Are you just blocking everything out?""

""I'm really good at compartmentalizing.""

""Okay then... Well, I'm going to look over the reports again and talk to your assigned imps and demons. We'll figure something out for the remainder of your stay here and let you know about it in the morning. Sounds good? Head off back to your room, then.""

I didn't argue. There wasn't really a point to arguing. I just went to my room, cleaned up, and got in bed. Did I really see a dragon today? There was a time I would have wanted nothing else, but now... Well, I guess after millennia of being tortured, even a dragon can't excite me.

##Day 6,320,431:

The next morning I awoke to a new imp. He smiled up at me and, in a friendly but hurried voice, said ""morning, boss. Hope you're ready for the day. We've got a few newcomers that Lord Satan is sending your way. He said to let you know you're completely in charge of their torture for the day and to swing by his office afterwards."" Handing you an envelope, ""oh, I almost forgot, Lord Satan sent this.""

I opened the envelope to find a card. It looked like the kind of card you could pick up at a drug store and printed in primary colors on the front was the phrase ""good luck."" I opened the card to find a brief note.

""We decided to promote you. You're now an honorary demon. Your assistant's name is Tim and he'll answer any questions you have about your new job. Come by after the day so we can nail down the specifics. We believe in you!""

I sighed. ""Alright, Tim, let's get to work.""

Tim's definition of ""a few"" needs to be refined. I had a group of five hundred souls at my mercy. Satan likes to group them by their most notable sins, the things that really had them sent to hell, and my group was labeled ""white liars."" Yeah, heads up, even those little white lies will get you. Tell a kid that Santa is real? Straight to hell with you.

For their first round of torture, I decided to go old school. Copying lines. With a twist that I can't take credit for. It had been so long ago that I couldn't remember the author, but I remembered the book and the torture device.

""I must not tell lies."" Written with a pen that carved the words into your hand and used your blood as ink. I made them write for hours.

Before I knew it, my day was done and I was headed to Satan's office to ""nail down specifics."" I asked Tim if he knew what that was about, and he said it had to do with my contract.

As he had the day before, he was reviewing some notes Without looking up, Satan started talking to me. ""Interesting choice of torture. Why lines?""

""Why not? They're in hell. If they went through the same orientation I did upon arrival, they're expecting the worst of the worst immediately. Lines sound harmless. A pen that carves your lines into your flesh is bad, but not the worst thing imaginable. Let them think it isn't that bad for a while. Then drop something new on them out of nowhere.""

""Hmm. Sound reasoning.""

""Tim said something about a contract? I didn't know I had a contract.""

""Ah, you don't. Not yet, anyway. You're only the second person to ever become bored with hell.""

""Oh. Who was the first?""

""Me. And now I'm in charge. I'm thinking you could be a good second-in-command one day. What do you think?""

""Uh...""

""Not for a while, of course,"" Satan laughed. ""You have a ways to go, but I wouldn't mind being able to take a vacation. I haven't had one since the first Dark Ages. And that was something like twenty-thousand years ago? I don't know, time is weird. It's just been a while.""

I started blankly. I wasn't really sure what to say.

""So this is the standard demon contract and the standard imp contract. I've taken bits from the two of them and added a couple other things here, like you can move into a suite or even an apartment instead of the one room you're in now. Oh, and here's a good one, I can give you back some bodily desires like eating if you want. If you're interested, just sign your name at the bottom and we'll get your training started.""

I froze. Obviously, I was going to sign, there was no reason not to, but something was holding me back.

""Books,"" I blurt out.

""What?""

""I remember reading when I was alive. I want to read all the books!""

Satan slowly pulled back the contract. ""All the books? Are you sure? I can add that in, but it seems a little excessive.""

""Yes. *All* the books.""

With a smirk, Lord Satan amended the contract and I signed quickly before he could change his mind.

Over the next few hours, I moved into my new space and was given an ereader with access to all the books that had ever existed. New books were added automatically.

And I had to read them all. Even the worst books. Imagine the worst self-published book you've ever come across. Something like 90% of all books ever written are like that. And I signed a contract stating that I would read them all.

As it turns out, even Satan's second-in-command gets tortured.

""Uh, yeah, I guess so.""

""And yet, somehow, you haven't lost your sanity?""

""I haven't? I guess I just assumed I had. That's strange.""

""No, no. According to this here, you're quite sane. See, when you go insane, we toss you into a cell and your mind tortures you for us. Saves time, you know, less messy, too."" A speculative tone enters his voice, ""has nothing today impacted you?""

I thought back, but my memory of the day is just a fuzzy boredom. ""I don't think so, no.""

""The toothpicks? The dragon? ... What about that interesting intestinal plague?""

""Dragon? No, I don't remember a dragon.""

Confused, ""what do you mean you don't remember a dragon? Are you just blocking everything out?""

""I'm really good at compartmentalizing.""

""Okay then... Well, I'm going to look over the reports again and talk to your demons. We'll figure something out for the remainder of your stay here and let you know about it in the morning. Sounds good? Head off back to your room, then.""

I didn't argue. There wasn't really a point to arguing. I just went to my room, cleaned up, and got in bed. Did I really see a dragon today? There was a time I would have wanted nothing else, but now... Well, I guess after millennia of being tortured, even a dragon can't excite me.

The next morning I awoke to a new demon. He smiled up at me and, in a friendly but hurried voice, said ""morning, boss. Hope you're ready for the day. We've got a few newcomers that Lord Satan is sending your way. He said to let you know you're completely in charge of their torture for the day and to swing by his office afterwards.""

Amy is really good in these comics without dropping her crush on Sonic. She’s not annoying or crazy like she used to be in past games and comics.

Silver is just adorable. They maintain some of his seriousness from ‘06 when the moment calls for it, but he’s also a huge dork and it just works.

Blaze is great as usual.

Shadow has been treated really well. He’s not incredibly “edgy” and he’s actually given more complex motivations based on his own past actions and experiences.

They’ve added a handful of new characters—not including background characters. The new antagonists are decent enough be they basically just entered the story. And there’s too new heroes who I actually like. They’re pretty good characters, but they don’t hog the spotlight which is good.

Most importantly though, Sonic doesn’t come across as incredibly annoying. He’s pretty laid back but is very quick to come to someone’s aid. And his dialog makes him friendly but cocky without seeming like some egotistical asshole (which I found to be an issue in past comics). He works, I think.

GETTING INTO/OUT OF CITIES (SEATTLE)

Timothy, like many successful Coyotes, has a mysterious past. No one seems to have worked with him more than ten years ago, but those longer-term customers say that he was pretty skilled even when he first arrived on the scene. He drives a GMC Bulldog that has seen decades of service. Although he affects a southern accent and a very Republic of Texas-inspired ten-gallon hat, anyone who rides with him will notice that he loses his drawl when there are tense moments or when he gets caught up in the action. 

Timothy tends to hang out on the Salish-Shidhe side of the UCAS-Salish Shidhe border, but when he is in Seattle he has a couple of suburban bars where he tends to unwind.

Friendly, but professional, Timothy has little patience for anyone who tries to take advantage of him, and has prepared his ride with various defensive measures to make sure he won’t get taken by surprise by his often touchy and paranoid cargo. 

His fake identity is that of a dangerous goods courier, giving him plenty of excuses for frequent travel, as well as a plausible excuse for lead boxes.

"eblix4c","Yes!

This is especially true for children who are homeschooled or otherwise usually isolated from the public. 

When I was in college, I worked at a youth shelter and had a kid admitted because one of the parents had fallen ill from ketoacidosis. Other parent walks a couple of miles and manages, somehow, to get someone to call for help. I say someone, because both parents and the child are reported to be deaf.

The family lived waaaaay out in the middle of hell ‘n gone and no one even knew the kid existed. Kid was a TEENAGER. Kid’s birth was never registered. Both parents were deaf and we were told the kid was too. First responders report that the home was a hovel unfit for even animals to safely live in. Obviously, kid can’t stay there.

Kid comes to the shelter and doesn’t know how to manage the most rudimentary of tasks. Kid was basically a borderline feral child. But, kid isn’t physically aggressive and seems to be somewhat friendly, but super defensive. So, shelter workers start noticing that if they walked up behind the kid, kid would turn around and acknowledge that someone was walking up. Turns out, kid wasn’t deaf at all. Kid just couldn’t talk, because both parents, again, are deaf. If no one ever talks to you, who do you have to talk to?

If that parent hadn’t fallen ill, that kid likely would never have been discovered.",1544572173,"but, kid isn’t physically aggressive and seems to be somewhat friendly, but super defensive.","friendly, but super","friendly","but",TRUE,"somewhat friendly , but super defensive","defensive","somewhat","super",1

Granted my perspective is biased. I grew up in the midwest and what I consider being friendly and hospitable is different than the standard down there.

People in the south seem to be more talkative and enjoy small talk and pleasantries more but the way I was raised that's almost considered offensive (in my area small talk is pretty much reserved for making passive aggressive conversation with someone you don't like). At the same time people from around my home town are often very blunt and to the point.

An example would be in Bama someone who needed assistance would talk around a subject to give you the option to offer your help, where in Minnesota they just blurt it out. The way many down there talk around what they want drives me nuts, it feels like they're trying to manipulate me but if I'm blunt it's considered rude to them.

&gt;Dupree and Fiske suspect that the behavior stems from a liberal person’s desire to connect with other races.

But it’s also possible that “this is happening because people are using common stereotypes in an effort to get along,” Dupree says.

&gt;Initial data from follow-up studies suggest that describing a black person as highly intelligent, thus reversing the stereotype, or as already highly motivated to get along with whites, thus removing the need to prove goodwill, can reduce the likelihood that a white person will downplay their competence in their interactions with the black person.",1543603833,"one possible reason for the “competence downshift,” as the authors describe it, is that, regardless of race, people tend to downplay their competence when they want to appear likeable and friendly.","likeable and friendly","friendly",NA,FALSE,"likeable and friendly","likeable",NA,NA,0

"e8lh4mr","Espionage and political interference by foreign powers is at unprecedented levels in Australia and poses a major risk to security, the nation’s spy agency boss has warned.

Duncan Lewis, the Director-General of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO), told a Senate estimates hearing on Monday that he was concerned about escalating activities.

“Hostile intelligence poses a real and potential existential threat to Australian security and sovereignty,” Mr Lewis said.

“The harm from this threat may not manifest for many years, even decades, after the activities occur. We are concerned about threats from wherever they emanate.”

In an era of high-level hacking attacks, assassinations on foreign soil, astro-turfing fake news campaigns and infiltrating attempts of the political class, one expert believes espionage is a bigger problem now than during the Cold War.

The nature of espionage has changed rapidly, but in recent years China and Russia have ramped things up, said Professor Rory Medcalf, head of the National Security College at Australian National University.

“The activities that would be concerning ASIO cover the full spectrum from risks associated with political donations through to old-fashioned espionage.”

On the traditional end of the spying scale, Prof Medcalf said it was a “fair assumption” to make that a number of countries currently housed intelligence officers in their embassies and consulates in Australia.

“That’s not a new thing. That’s how espionage has always been practised. And it would be reasonable to assume that China is the most active player in that sense, followed by Russia.”

But a determined focus by China to influence and take control of the “tone and policy choices” of decision-makers in the West has been a game-changer for spying, he said.

“In some ways, the espionage problem is probably worse than it was during the Cold War.”

PRESIDENT XI’S BRAVE NEW WORLD

A LOWER THRESHOLD

The rules and state of play of espionage across the board have shifted dramatically, particularly in the past few years, experts say.

Dr John Coyne, head of the Border Security Program at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI), said some regimes have been emboldened by the West’s inaction.

“If I said to you a decade ago that the Russians would kill two of their citizens on UK soil, one with a chemical agent and the other using a radioactive agent, you’d think I was reading from the script of a James Bond film,” Dr Coyne said.

“If I told you North Korea would poison one of its citizens in a major airport using a chemical agent, you’d think it wasn’t possible.”

Earlier this month, president of Interpol Meng Hongwei was detained by Communist Party authorities during a visit to Beijing. The Chinese national hasn’t been heard from since and his wife now fears he is dead.

“If I’d raised that as a remote possibility a decade ago, you’d think I was crazy, just as you would if I told you the Saudis would kill one of their citizens in one of their embassies and chop him up into pieces.

“The thresholds have dropped significantly and we face a completely different threat environment.”

He blames the slow international response to major, high-profile incidents for a growing confidence felt by certain regimes.

“There is evidence that Russia was involved in the shooting down of (Malaysian Airlines flight) MH17 and they copped a few sanctions and not much else. Russia and North Korea’s assassination activities, barely anything,” Dr Coyne said.

“Those who will do us ill look and see little consequences for using these methods. The West isn’t responding, so of course those countries are emboldened. They can get away with it.”

Prof Medcalf said states like Russia tended to favour short-term and highly disruptive acts while China was very carefully and strategic playing a “long game”.

“A lot of it is about cultivating individuals, not for immediate use but to support China’s interests in the long run,” he said.

“Of course, that’s quite difficult to detect or respond to because it’s happening below the surface over a long period of time.”

BUYING LONG-TERM FRIENDS

In May, Mr Lewis told the Senate that foreign states have maintained an interest in attempting to sway key figures in public and private life in Australia.

Their efforts often appear harmless and friendly, but could have significant consequences down the track, the ASIO chief warned.

“Foreign (individuals) covertly attempt to influence and shape the views of members of the Australian public, the Australian media, officials in the Australian government and members of the diaspora communities here in Australia,” he said.

Foreign spies to face harsh new penalties under new Australian laws

Former Labor senator Sam Dastyari was embroiled in two scandals involving dealings with a Chinese businessman who was linked to the Communist Party.

Mr Dastyari was sensationally forced to quit the shadow frontbench in 2016 when it was revealed Huang Xiangmo had paid some of his bills, as well as being a campaign donor.

Then in 2017, he left politics all together after revelations he told the man his phone was likely being tapped, including by US intelligence agencies.

Mr Dastyari has denied any deliberate wrongdoing.

“I think the two Dastyari affairs drove change,” Prof Medcalf said.

“Before that, there was a degree of naivety in the political class and a degree of denial. Political parties had become disturbingly dependent on foreign funding. That is changing.

“The unfinished business now is for new legislation banning foreign political donations.”

Professor Medcalf claimed China operated entire departments whose goal is “to co-op and exploit goodwill and friendly voices in foreign countries in order to increase China’s power and influence” abroad.

“That’s all kinds of seemingly innocent friendship societies and business lobby groups and so forth, but it provides a bridge for long-term Chinese influence,” he said.

Another concern is China’s cash splash in the Pacific region, pouring significant amounts of money into infrastructure and nation-building projects.

Some fear the goal is to ensure long-term influence over countries that would normally be staunch allies of Australia.

In its last Budget, the Government announced the biggest-ever foreign aid package to Pacific nations, seen as a way of countering China’s activities.

The commander of the US Army in the Pacific region, General Robert Brown, told a conference in Canberra earlier this year that there were strings attached to the gifts from China, which should worry the West.

And in September, it was revealed Australia is developing plans with Papua New Guinea for a joint naval base on Manus Island after China took an interest in four major port redevelopments across PNG.

SNAPPING UP ASSETS

Another key strategy for China has been purchasing or investing in infrastructure projects in strategically positioned regions like Australia.

Chinese companies have been on a spending spree across the country for years, snapping up everything from housing and industrial sites to major ports in Darwin and Melbourne.

It spent a whopping $1 billion buying Aussie agricultural assets in 2017.

“The purchase of critical infrastructure by state-owned companies essentially sells off our strategic assets and puts them at the whim and control of a foreign power,” Dr Coyne said.",1540722870,"their efforts often appear harmless and friendly, but could have significant consequences down the track, the asio chief warned.","harmless and friendly","friendly",NA,FALSE,"harmless and friendly","harmless",NA,NA,0
"e8lgvfb","Espionage and political interference by foreign powers is at unprecedented levels in Australia and poses a major risk to security, the nation’s spy agency boss has warned.

Duncan Lewis, the Director-General of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO), told a Senate estimates hearing on Monday that he was concerned about escalating activities.

“Hostile intelligence poses a real and potential existential threat to Australian security and sovereignty,” Mr Lewis said.

“The harm from this threat may not manifest for many years, even decades, after the activities occur. We are concerned about threats from wherever they emanate.”

In an era of high-level hacking attacks, assassinations on foreign soil, astro-turfing fake news campaigns and infiltrating attempts of the political class, one expert believes espionage is a bigger problem now than during the Cold War.

The nature of espionage has changed rapidly, but in recent years China and Russia have ramped things up, said Professor Rory Medcalf, head of the National Security College at Australian National University.

“The activities that would be concerning ASIO cover the full spectrum from risks associated with political donations through to old-fashioned espionage.”

On the traditional end of the spying scale, Prof Medcalf said it was a “fair assumption” to make that a number of countries currently housed intelligence officers in their embassies and consulates in Australia.

"e5xo127","**5:00** - You don't gain anything by staying in net on kickoff. You want to either follow up the middle (which I would in this situation given that one of them should normally grab corner boost) or grab a corner boost yourself. I'm a huge advocate for one player always cheating up in 3s. Still, staying in goal can be confusing for your teammate taking the kick-off. I can't tell you how many times I've told my buddy off (in a friendly but serious manner) for staying in net in the case where I take the kickoff, realize I can't get the side boost, and look to the corner and see the boost there, but when I start going for it, he goes and takes it because he stayed in net, leaving me in a complicated spot where I have to collect boost while our 3rd teammate is left to pressure alone. So, make sure one person is always following up the middle and the person taking the kickoff should revert to 3rd man in most scenarios while the 2 supporting players go on the offensive.

**4:56** - You can tell pretty early that your teammate is going to challenge this and so you shouldn't be. You can see him and he can't see you, and his challenge isn't unwarranted. You're responsible for this double-commit because of that. Part of playing at the higher levels is reading your teammates.

**4:49** - I'm not a fan of how you rotated all of the way back to the net here. You can see that you have your 3rd teammate coming in far post, so there's no need for you to do the same. You should be pushed in towards your teammate challenging the ball so that you can make a play on the deflection and keep up the pressure.

**4:42** - It's great that you're strict about rotating back to net and not lingering in these scenarios, but you're coming in too shallow. You need to enter from the far post because the entire back side of the net is vulnerable had their shot gone towards the far post. You're pretty far off the line when you go to make this save as well. Be sure you can stay tight with the line so that your challenges don't have to be forced towards your back wall.

**4:26** - This is a wasted touch. You can't see down the field where you're hitting it, but you also have the knowledge that your teammates aren't over there. Don't just give up possession. Hit the ball away from pressure into a space you can keep possession. I know your boost is low, but if you play it right then you have the momentum to grab more and follow it up for a touch. You lost a lot of speed by trying to hit it in a direction away from where your momentum is carrying you, so if you had just hit it straight ahead so that it rolled up the side wall, you could have kept your speed, grabbed some boost pads, and followed it up for another hit. Even a hit towards your back corner where you grabbed corner boost and cleared it out (if you have the mechanical skill to do so) would have been a nice idea. Your touch ended up being a pass to the other team and you drove out of the way, leaving the goal wide open for them.

**4:17** - The moment you see your other teammate there in front of you is the moment you should be heading back to cover the back field. Your goal is left wide-open and the opponents are all lined up ready to defend.

**4:13** - Be more patient on this clear. You don't do much with it the way you tried to clear it. Let it get closer to the back wall and then go for the pinch.

**3:50** - Better recovery here. You need to land on all 4 wheels and be facing down the wall so that you pick up some initial speed.

**3:46** - 2 things here: (1) You're not picking up any boost on your way back to net. (2) Just like earlier, you're rotating back to net with a shallow path and leaving half of the goal vulnerable. Remembering to do 1 or both of these things likely would have saved that goal.

**3:36** - You keep inching in towards your teammate here and every moment you do so puts you in a harder position to attack from. You have a 2v1 with one defender rotating on the back post, though not quite there yet. No one is in mid-field to challenge a direct pass to you and no one is challenging your teammate. Their last defender started pushing up to challenge, meaning the guy who rotates in behind him can't possibly defend the back wall since the goal is undefended. Stay mid-field for that direct pass, keeping space so that you actually have an angle to shoot from, or ready your self for a high cross to the far post or off the backboard, which is the other option your teammate should be looking for since the back wall shouldn't be defended. Don't get sucked in. You got sucked into a position where it didn't make sense for you to challenge and you're stuck in the corner.

**3:12** - I really don't like how you cheated up on this kickoff and I never understood why some people do this. The person cheating up is responsible for a dead-ball and you're completely taking away your ability to defend that. If you're not protecting the goal from that scenario then your 3rd man who went for corner boost can no longer commit to turning up-field because they have to prepare to defend that scenario, which kind of defeats the purpose and takes away one of your possible offensive opportunities where the ball rolls up the left wall. Cheating at this angle doesn't really give you much advantage relative to cheating behind, but it takes away plenty of pressure opportunities and leaves you vulnerable.

**3:04** - If you can't do anything with this then you probably just want to get out of there.

**2:55** - Too much emphasis on the big boost pad here. You can get nearly full boost by picking up mid-field and remaining part of the play.

**2:30** - You're cutting the corner every time you're rotating into net. It's hurt you before in this game and it even slowed down your challenge here.

**2:16** - You're very obviously late to this challenge and there's already one of you committed to their side of the field. Let them have it while you rotate back to your side of the field.

**2:13** - You shouldn't be rotating down the same side of the field. Adjust your path towards center field and pick up the little boost pads. Figure out what those routes are that cross over them. It's clear you took the near-post route here because of the 100% boost and it was purely a guess that it would respawn by the time you got there (it didn't).

**1:51** - You're taking yourself out of the play again and focusing on the big boost pad.

**1:47** - Not a bad challenge, but not a good hit. Just to take note of my previous comment, had you gathered little boost pads and stayed closer to the play, there would have been no need to rush across field and make this touch from a poor angle.

**1:42** - Your teammate doesn't get a good clear here and you still alter your course to cut off the far post. Get all of the way to the back post before you turn in when you're responsible for the goal.

**1:33** - No need to drive into your teammate here. Create some space across the field to allow your self to push up and be a passing option.

**1:23** - I'm sure you recognize that you dodged out of the way of this challenge. Still, there's no need for you to flip at all, and doing so doesn't benefit your team nearly as much as simply getting in the way and doing a soft block to keep the ball on their end and slow the game down a bit.

**1:16** - You cut off the post again. Fix this bad habit because you're really opening yourself up to some easy goals and making some simple clears difficult for yourself.

**0:48** - You're in a horribly dangerous position here. Give your teammate space when they're dribbling, especially when they're getting challenged. When they're getting challenged, you should always assume that they're going to lose said challenge, especially when you're last man in charge of the goal. Your goal and the entire center of the field is vulnerable because you're pushed out wide.

**0:40** - That's a really good touch.

**0:26** - Don't get sucked into the play. You have 2 teammates near the ball; there's no need for you to be there as well. Keep the space and let them pressure. If they manage to disrupt the play and the ball is loosened for you, then you can challenge it, but this was just reckless.

**0:19** - You realize you're going to lose this challenge and that it's going to be hit over you, but you also know that you have 2 teammates behind you somewhere. Don't turn immediately back. Stay up and see if the pass is coming.

**0:14** - Shallow goal rotation.

**0:05** - I get that it's desperation time, but you got sucked in way too much on this play when the ball was very likely going to be pushed outside where you could have been waiting for it to send it back in.",1536880665,"i can't tell you how many times i've told my buddy off (in a friendly but serious manner) for staying in net in the case where i take the kickoff, realize i can't get the side boost, and look to the corner and see the boost there, but when i start going for it, he goes and takes it because he stayed in net, leaving me in a complicated spot where i have to collect boost while our 3rd teammate is left to pressure alone.","friendly but serious","friendly","but",FALSE,"friendly but serious","serious",NA,NA,1
"e5lua0i","Not really what you're looking for OP (sorry!) but I'll add that while I haven't been to the far east part of Russia, I have been to Siberia (Novosibirsk, Lake Baikal, Irkutsk). Figured I might as well give a short answer considering the other guy in this thread did the same.

It's pretty much as far away from home as I've felt, alongside rural Mongolia. Very different from Western Europe.

I went during the summer so the weather was nice and cool. Infrastructure was lacking in quite a few areas. It felt industrial, as you would expect really. Living costs were impressively cheap. Some parts were visibly quite run down. Alcoholism was easy to spot (also applies to Mongolia). Good quality cheap alcohol. Novosibirsk Zoo was interesting. Lake Baikal was stunning and I highly recommend it!

People were friendly, but few spoke English so communication was hard as hell. Many Russians have a tough outer shell (also don't expect much politeness when it comes to customer service) but they open up when you start talking to them. Many were just really curious. Irkutsk sees a decent amount of tourists go through to get to Lake Baikal, but Novosibirsk attracts a lot fewer visitors. In Novosibirsk we talked to a police officer who had never met a foreigner in his life. Those working in pubs, restaurants and shops were often surprised to see us and even more surprised to learn that we were from Sweden. It didn't take long to meet people to go for drinks with. 

Overall it was a very interesting part of the world and I found the locals to be surprisingly welcoming.

"e5ltir2","Hi u/somethingaboutkinks,

I suspect your feelings are not unusual - I've felt them myself, and still do.  I wouldn't be surprised if everyone on here comes to you and says, ""That's perfectly normal!""  That's because it's perfectly normal.  Our sexuality isn't in line with the global moral consensus (yet), so you exist in a world that will subtly (and not so subtly) try to tell you your choices are incorrect.

That isn't inherently a bad thing - the same mechanism stops us from, for example, murdering each other for food.  It falls down when it comes to things society find unacceptable, but on closer inspection isn't actually bad at all.  See homosexuality, being a woman, being a minority, liking k-pop...

There isn't a magic bullet for you to accept who you are, and to re-write the moral narrative you've been fed for so long.  It either takes a conscious, and difficult, effort to address each dissenting thought you have (PM me for a side-bar on how to do that (anyone), but I'm not a therapist so my info is third hand); finding a therapist who will help you integrate these feelings effectively (though finding a therapist who is able to separate their own moral background from your sessions is a trick); or finding a partner (or group) who will help you through these thoughts.

That last is the way most of us end up achieving calm, but beware - the road is paved with abuse, use and dishonest intent.  That isn't just the BDSM road, that's the personal relationship road in general - its just that the BDSM cars cruise down that road with our top down, and the doors unlocked.

I can't give you good advice on how to find a nourishing relationship - I *would* advise you to find a kink friendly, but utterly uninterested, friend who you can discuss your partners with and who you would tell all to.  They can give you an emotionally untangled view of a partners activities.  Again - tricky, because what's abuse to one person is fun-times to another.  Oh what a tangled web we weave - then have to un-weave and pack away neatly later on.

If you have any issues, or you need more clarification - just post here again.  You'll generally always get a good mix of replies, some of those abusive, some not - but with context and up/down votes to help you separate the wheat from the chaff.

Good luck - and keep asking questions.  We're here to help!

[Elynna](https://daoce.wikia.com/wiki/Elynna_Amell) has some difficulty understanding marriage. As a Circle Mage, it wasn't something she saw, at all, growing up. It was a thing one read about in books. And when one's home environment consists of a lot of mages engaging in friendly, but brief relationships, with a handful of truly committed ones sprinkled in, it becomes a difficult concept to understand. Some of the Templars, particularly the new and overly-scandalized ones, try to explain and instill those values in the younger mages, but it was largely unsuccessful. And as Elynna ages, the concept of only two people bound together by a ceremony becomes something Elynna actively dislikes. Not only does it condemn the way Kinloch Hold functions, but one of the strongest committed relationships Elynna knows-- Greagoir, Irving, and Wynne-- simply could not be. To her mind, love is love and the whole marriage thing simply stifles some of the more varied forms it can come in.

Needless to say, becoming Alistair's mistress was inconsequential to her. Just some strange label they had to throw on their relationship to make all of these people who subscribe to marriage happy. Or not. The whole thing is immaterial to her, but it does seem to bother him that he cannot do better by her. Greagoir is also somewhat upset by this turn of events, though much like his dislike of Alistair, his protests are more to keep his little girl closer to home than in Denerim.

**Gareth Hawk** in contrast, grew up with a very strong marriage as his reference for how things should progress. He understands the concept and is somewhat frightened by the permanence of it all; he's a bit of a commitment-phobe when he arrives in Kirkwall, and marriage is quite far from his mind. Part of the reason why he gravitated towards Isabela.

Yet as he falls for her, and sees those scars of her past, while he realizes he would wish to marry her, he won't. His love for her and respect for her wish to not be caged more than overrides his interest in the institution. They both know that they're each other's safe harbor, and that's enough.

**Alberech Trevelyan** grew up in a very conservative family and later joined the Templars. Marriage to him is the highest and most sacred of vows one can make before the Maker to symbolize one's abiding love for another. Since the Exalted Council he's been trying to balance running the Divine's peacekeeping force as well as trying to plan the most romantic and thoughtful proposal he possibly can for the Lady Seeker. Something people will talk of for centuries-- for him, Cassandra deserves no less.",1533049932,"and when one's home environment consists of a lot of mages engaging in friendly, but brief relationships, with a handful of truly committed ones sprinkled in, it becomes a difficult concept to understand.","friendly, but brief","friendly","but",TRUE,"friendly , but brief","brief",NA,NA,1

"e2edua8","I hate that “Less is more” saying. Less isn’t more and more is much less than real. You want to be true to life. If “being less” is your aim, it becomes your objective in the scene, and it is artificially controlled or weak. If hamming it up and playing for audience reaction is your goal, you lose all of your character’s humanity. Allow your character to live in the scene truthfully.  This is the right kind of “letting go and having fun”. Let go and have fun pursuing your character’s objective...listening and reacting. Stop thinking about whether to be bigger or smaller. Think your character’s thoughts. That’s the only thing that should be in your head. 

As for CDs, when you walk into their room, you should be thinking, “I’m the actor you are looking for. I am confident I can do this well. I am professional and easy to work with.”  Show interest in meeting them and be personable and friendly, but not needy or desperate. They need someone for this role. If you are the best at it, you are doing them a big favor. Just be the best. 

I don’t recommended learning from a CD. You only have one chance to make a first impression, and you don’t want to be stuck in their mind as a green beginner. I am an acting coach in Hollywood and I encourage my private students to do CD workshops after they have honed their skills. And we often work on the material from the CDs class in our lessons so they will be prepared and impressive. You want to knock their socks off when they see you...whether in class or in an audition. 

If a scripted character appears whiny, then you are judging her rather harshly. See if you might read the role another way. Get into her mindset. You’ve got to understand her motivation...be on her side. Then be her. There are many different tactics you can use other than whining. Know what she wants and go after it in a variety of ways.

"e2e9ydb","True, it's not universal (I worked at a place with great managers and great co-workers, but I just couldn't stand doing the job itself so I had to quit) but 95% of the time the manager makes or breaks a working environment.

I worked at a Starbucks kiosk for roughly 3 years. It went through 3 managers there and it really drove home the difference they make. The first manager was great and I enjoyed working there. But she had to retire, and the manager position was given to the assistant manager.

The assistant manager went bonkers. As AM she was nice and friendly, but she seemingly went mad with power after her promotion, And she really seemed to have a problem with me in particular for some reason. She would berate me in front of customers for things I didn't do, wouldn't let me defend myself because she ""didn't want to hear excuses"", then when I finally managed to tell her it wasn't me she wouldn't apologize, she'd just say ""oh, well, I'm on my period"".  I nearly quit on the spot when she accused me of stealing her reading glasses and claimed that I'd have to pay for them. Apparently they were 200$. I flatly refused. She eventually got fired for calling the general manager of the store a cunt to his face.

"e21t6dc","That was cute! And very refreshing.

This is TWICE's first attempt at a summer song and they really hit it home. It's catchy, uptempo, definitely very inviting and friendly, but overall (and most importantly) – IT'S FUN! What I really like is the bit of syncopation in the chorus, and yeah it's mostly I-IV-V but they throw in that really quick G in there to give it some funky flavor. I also like how they add brass into the chorus. But most importantly, the verses build up to how anthemic and energetic that chorus is! This song keeps the verses at a sorta mid-tempo, meandering pace but then as soon as they say ""If you wanna have some fun"" you can feel it building up and then TWICE hit it home with that totally awesome point dance and really good catchy chorus! So much summer vibes – they definitely got that SISTAR summer touch with the brass added in the chorus because that's such a pivotal point of a lot of summer songs – that brassy flair. 

What I also really like in terms of the MV (I mean they're all really gorgeous girls but you already knew that so what else can I say besides stating that they're absolutely beautiful?) is that the color palette and theme gradually gets darker, BUT they also have the subtle transitions from many a summery palette of colors to white to classic red + blue + white colors. Yes, red + white + blue is like 'Murican pride and all that, but ya know what else you associate with red + white + blue? Summertime. Just think about it – lifeguard swimsuits? Red. Water? Ocean blue. Famous baches are often known for being 'white and sandy', no? They didn't just hit it home with the song – they totally nailed it with the color scheme in this one too. I mean yeah, filming it all at a beach near the ocean in a tropical setting totally helps set that mood too but you gotta give them (and their creative team) props for keeping the colors in mind. Just look at how they're all dancing at the end and how Momo clearly stands out in that blue sparkling skirt – and how the red and white pop out as well. 

Overall, fun summer song, really effective MV! Do I like it as much as 'What is Love?' and think it's surpassed it? Probably not. But do I definitely see this being a summer hit and becoming a staple for my listening this July? Oh 100% absolutely! Nice upbeat melodies, fun dancing and choreo, lovely ladies as always, and great music video aesthetics – all in all, this is a 1 to 10 total homerun for TWICE!

"e14jjjl","Late to the party, but what the hell. I had done Crossfit for several years and always had a soft spot for the strongman-style movements - sled push/pull, tire flips, farmers carry, etc. Having done several Crossfit competitions I enjoyed scratching that competitive itch (although I'm a shitty Crossfitter), and started kicking around the idea of finding a Strongman show. I had a few extra whiskeys one night and decided to sign up for one nearby, novice HW division. The events and weights were published ahead of time, but honestly I wasn't sure I could do any of them. I'm a big guy but not particularly strong pound for pound. And I later found out that the show promoter was known for going ""heavy"" :)

I didn't know anyone competing in the show at the time, but did have a friend (on the other side of the country...) who was a veteran strong(wo)man competitor - she was great at giving me pointers, reviewing video, etc. In a big stroke of luck there is a gym 5 minutes from me with all the implements you could possibly want to train with. I went down there the next day, signed up for a membership, and introduced myself to the owner, who happens to be a national-level strongman and extremely nice guy to boot. On top of that they run ""Strongman Saturdays"" at the gym, with 5-15 people of various experience levels showing up and working out. Everyone was incredibly friendly and helpful. It really ended up being a ""perfect storm"" of resources for me to get good practice and coaching ahead of the show. If you can pull this off, I \*highly\* recommend it :)

I had about 10 weeks to prep. I focused on just getting stronger (squat/deadlift/press/bench primarily) 4 days a week, and then dedicated several hours every Saturday to working with the implements I'd see in the show. I was familiar with barbell cleans, presses, jerks, etc so moving to axles and logs wasn't too bad. Keg was (and still is) a goddamn nightmare, but hey. By the time the show rolled around I felt confident that I could at least not zero in all the events but the deadlift. Even in hindsight I think the 80/20 split between ""get stronger"" and ""learn strongman implements"" was exactly right. There IS technique involved, some of it pretty subtle, but if you're not strong enough it really doesn't matter.

Having done Crossfit competitions in the past, I had a decent handle on what to bring - all the mobility aids, a pillow (it's nice to nap, or at least be comfortable) drinks with electrolytes, and lots of energy dense food (I like jerky, dried fruit, and coconut clusters for protein/carbs/fat respectively). Food comes down to personal preference I think - but if you've never done a daylong athletic competition before, I'd recommend light foods in lots of small doses vs large meals. We did 5 events over probably 7 hours, so my routine was eat, mobilize, practice (the show had all implements available in a warmup area), event, then repeat. Eat even if you're not hungry, this shit is hard work and demands fuel!

What went well - the moving events were great for me. I took 3rd in the farmers carry (missed 1st by &lt;1 sec) and 4th in the odd object carry (keg, husafel, sandbag). I'll credit practice and Crossfit for this, moving heavy weights while still breathing is a skill as much as anything else and I'd had lots of experience with it.

What didn't go well, the other events :) Also, waking up at 4am with a major case of nerves and not being able to go back to sleep! Press medley went exactly as expected, alas - I was able to power clean and push jerk the axle bar (220) but couldn't get the keg overhead (200). I zeroed on the axle deadlift. I was hoping for one rep, but it was 480 on the bar vs. my then 1RM barbell deadlift of 415, so I knew it'd be a stretch. Trying to lift this did really bad things for my back, so I spent a few bucks at the bodywork tent - really recommend taking advantage if the show has this available. Atlas stones went just ok - I fumbled the first load, then panicked and never really got my composure back. A minute is a long enough that I'd have been better off backing away for a five count, getting my shit together, and then getting back on the stones - live and learn! 

My goal was to score in all the events, knowing that the deadlift was going to be a big stretch - so definitely was happy with my performance overall. I was really pleasantly surprised to place 5th out of 9 in my division, including beating out a couple guys who were real monsters. The guys who placed ahead of me were way out of my league - they all got 10-15 reps on the 480# axle DL :o 

The main lesson learned was that I need to get a LOT stronger, but I knew that was likely to be the case going in. The second lesson was just how gassed I was after the show. I drove home, got on the couch, and fell asleep at about 8:00. I tried to do some light squats the next day, and warmed up to about 50&amp;#37; before it became clear that was a terrible idea. Ended up taking 2 days completely off and then doing some \*very\* light stuff the rest of the week. My only regret was that I didn't spend more time getting to know the people there. Almost everyone was super friendly, but I tend to get in the zone when competing, and especially so when I'm nervous, which I absolutely was. Don't get me wrong, I think sticking to my routine was a very good thing in terms of the competition, but I could have made time to be a little bit more social without taking away from that. I would say in general the Open division competitors were much more relaxed and social than those of us in Novice - no big surprise I guess. Anyway, A+++, highly recommended, would do again.

Well, most girls in school were very reserved and a lot of my jokes were met with irritation and were *completely underappreciated*. But, anyway, as a youngster I think I was a bit presumptuous and I had the mouth of a sailor – an all-around terrible combination for a little girl.  

I mean, I’ve always wanted to get along with people – but back then, I wasn’t exactly good at socializing.  However, I’ve usually gotten along with most males because my interests and humor fell mostly down their alley. 

But socialization with other females was kind of above my head back then – I’d usually get along with other girls because I was really friendly, but most were just acquaintances rather than actual friends.  I was aware that I was completely awkward and would sometimes blurt out something idiotic – and spend days cringing about what I’d said. As for hiding parts of myself – I didn’t really share my true interests with other girls because I didn’t exactly want to be a social pariah. It was kind of down-putting not having many female friends, and I didn't want to make myself look any weirder.

But as I’ve aged, the Fe’s gotten better lol.  These days, I’ve now more or less learned how not to step on others’ toes and how to blend in conversation – while also sharing those weird parts of me, but not in a fucking socially awkward way. And now, I’ve acquired many more girlfriends – most of them being N types of course haha. 

Not to toot my own horn, but as of now, I think I’ve become quite the converser – but only thanks to stumbling over my feet so many times.  I believe I’m much more collected than I was in high school – but even now I hate looking back and facing the cringe lol.

Pickens County Gun Range in Liberty, SC is a good one if you want a free range with a lot of options. There is a 100 yard rifle range, 50 yard range, pistol range, and shotgun range. There is a very strict range officer at this one and very strict range rules. I appreciate the safety at this range but in my opinion they go a little over the top. For example. you must have all rifles locked open, chamber flagged, and the must sit on a rifle rack by the range officer when you aren't shooting or if you are walking downrange. Failure to comply results in getting kicked off. Be careful to mind the rules, they have a no tolerance policy. Shoot more than one round in 3 seconds? Kicked out. Remove your eyeglasses to wipe the sweat from you eyes while sitting at the bench? Kicked out. Don't have a chamber flag? Kicked out. The range officially closes at 5:30 but the range officer is usually a grumpy old guy that forces everyone to leave by 4:30. The crowd is usually professional type people, families, or LEO's. Friendly but usually quiet and focused, I've met some people here but usually they are there for real practice or training. Its very well built range thats great to shoot at but, I typically avoid it because the rules are very strict and the range officer is known to be unreasonably anal about enforcing them.  


Ceder Creek Range in Mountain Rest, SC. Its much farther away from Greenville but, I love this range, its my favorite because its hidden deep in the mountains of Oconee County, and there are lots of other outdoorsy, mountain activities you can do out here too. This is a small range with only a 100 yard range. Only 8 benches but, its remote so there isnt a lot of traffic. Your best bet is to get there before 11am on a weekend. The crowd is usually old men with their grandsons, families, or hunters. The crowds are always very friendly. I always make a new friend when I go to this place and I feel a lot more comfortable here because its much more relaxed. Likewise, since its remote people usually bring a lot of guns out. Its not uncommon to see a grandpa with his grandsons out here with a few dozen firearms shooting away. People here love to chat as well and people at this range love to share guns and ammo. I will take my AR to this range and leave 3 hours later having shot a dozen or so other guns by the other guests and they will have had a few turns with mine. The downside is its small. If you get there late, expect to wait. There also isnt a range officer although DNR pops in every now and then.  


  
Besides these 2, there's the Belton Gun Club which requires a membership. It has all of the above and a 300 yard range.  


Also, in North Carolina it is LEGAL to target shoot in the woods on NATIONAL FOREST land.   
So I will go find a primitive campsite that is very remote and go camping for a night and take my guns. As long as you are 100 yards away from a road or campsite and you arent shooting towards a road, campsite, or building, you can fire away. Make sure you can prove you are camping nearby, otherwise they may think you're poaching. But, it is legal as long as you are careful about where you are.

I think you need 50K or more monthly pageviews on a single site - I currently only have one such site, but it's not ""good"" for those networks ... I just milk it now, cuz it already paid 140% of it's cost since March 2017 ... 


EDIT: I use flippa, because Empire requires a deposit, and then you need to wait for site owner to give you access to analytics, which is very slow, in a fast-paced site buying biz.

Then if I need some other details, I need to ""ask"" and wait. There is no direct contact between seller and buyer - everything goes through gate keepers. EP is very bad at updating listing details, such as traffic and income. Often, listings are 2-3 months behind on updates.

Finally if I want to buy on EP, there is no ""buy it now"" and you are the winner. You need to transfer full amount to EP first, or have cash on deposit. So if someone has cash on deposit, they can still snatch it from you, even if you sent your money.

Bottom line, EP process is not ideal for buying. On top of that, they require minimum income to be $1000/mo, and with their valuations, that makes sites cost at least $25000. That is more than I'm willing to RISK on a site... my ceiling right now is 10K...

There's no need to pretend there's an equivalence. It's not just generic group A and generic group B. The rhetoric and policies they push disadvantage minorities in *order* to enrich the ""already secure"" (not only rich, but particularly non-minority).

"dzvnab4","Sometimes people just aren’t going to like you. They don’t have to. And I think when what you have in common is your partners’ friendship with each other, it can up the odds that the friends’ partners just won’t hit it off. It happens.

My husband is part of a closely knit group of guys. I’ve really liked a few of their girlfriends over the years and downright despised some of them. Luckily their wives are all reasonably likable people; some I like a lot and others I am neutral about but can be around them and have a nice time.

There are polite and impolite ways to handle it when you don’t like a friend-in-law, which is what all of these women are to me. Generally when I’ve just plain not been able to stand a significant other of one of his friends, I have just stepped back and suggested to my husband that he make plans with just his buddy, and I’ll stick to seeing that couple at the big group gatherings where I’ll only be around the partner in small doses. That seems to me to be the polite way to go about it, and it is admittedly easier for me to not agree to a double date when the group is big.

Acting like this woman is acting to you is not the polite or mature way to handle her dislike of you. If I were in your shoes, I’d probably heavily encourage your boyfriend to hang out with his friend just the guys, and on a much less frequent basis I’d agree to a double date and plaster on a smile and be nice and go. And I wouldn’t engage her in any back and forth. I’d be polite and reasonably friendly, but if I got secondhand word of having offended her, I’d just say, “I’m sorry to hear that” and promptly drop it. If she’s not going to be reasonable about either talking things out or letting things go, I wouldn’t bother putting in any real effort beyond the politeness for my partner’s sake.",1527773348,"i’d be polite and reasonably friendly, but if i got secondhand word of having offended her, i’d just say, “i’m sorry to hear that” and promptly drop it.","friendly, but if","friendly","but",TRUE,"polite and reasonably friendly","polite","reasonably",NA,0

"dx6gh19","We moved here from the US a few years back.  Overall it's been a very good experience.  

**Positives:**

* Much better work life balance
* More supportive family care policies (you get $140 child benefit each month, mat leave is for 1 year BUT it's not all paid leave, generally people seem way more used to kids here and cool with having them around)
* Good employment opportunities - Ireland is frequently the European base for multinationals.  Wages are high for Europe but less than many parts of the US 
* Proximity to the rest of Europe - super easy and cheap to travel (learn to love RyanAir)
* Good nightlife, always something to do
* Loads of fantastic cultural events - really strong here.
* People are generally very easy going, identity politics are not as prevalent as in the US, it's a bit more live and let live here. 
* Overall I feel like things here are moving in right direction - the marriage referendum, improved improved mental health care (although this is slow moving), increase in non-religious schools (educate togethers)
* It's very safe here - the republic is very stable politically, weapons are more tightly controlled here, no major natural disasters, nothing in nature will kill you!



**Negatives:**

* Weather - so the weather here is pretty mediocre, there isn't a long severe winter, limited snow and not much in the way of heat waves. The problem is that there's not really much of a summer.  It's very grey and it does rain a lot. 
* Medical system - it's very overcrowded, there aren't enough doctors, waiting times for most things are extreme. Also, I hear many Irish people say ""yes you have to wait longer but the quality of care is excellent when you receive it"", unfortunately that hasn't been my experience.
* Taxes:  the tax bands are incredibly high (20% and 40%, not including additional social taxes).  Honestly this money does go towards the greater good so that's encouraging.  But it is way more than you would pay in the states (not sure about Canada).
* Social cliques:  I find people here very friendly but difficult to become good friends with. They are nice and no problem going for a pint after work but it's sometimes difficult to move past that.

"dwa1xtt","I lost my 14 year old cat to a suspected brain tumor in July of last year. I took it really hard, as he was my first real pet, and I had him for over a decade. I wasn't really ready for another cat, since I have 2 other cats already but I missed having a dog cat (you know, one who follows you around, steals food, acts more like a dog than a cat). Anyway, a friend who does volunteer work for the local humane society said there was a cat there I would like. She's responsible for 3 of the 4 animals I've had, so I thought, well maybe it's a sign. I went to go see him at a Petsmart adoption event and we didn't click. The other volunteers told me about another cat at the humane society, so the next day or so, I went to go see him. Turns out that cat doesn't like dogs :(  as I'm looking around, one of the caretakers asks me if I need help, I tell her, I'm not really looking, but I would like an obnoxiously friendly black cat. I didn't get a chance to tell her I would prefer a male, and greater than 10# (I wanted to have another blood donor, but that's another story) she shows me this tiny female black cat. She is obnoxiously friendly, but busy, and she has a neurologic condition. I don't think that my other boys will appreciate her. I go home. 


A week or two later, I'm still thinking about her. I go back, and she's still there. I decided I can't leave her there, and start filling out the paperwork. While conversing with the staff, they tell me she's been at the humane society for a while. (It's October) I ask when she came in. Her intake day was the day after I put my cat to sleep. I got a little teary eyed. I feel like it was just a sign it would be ok. And it is. She's perfect. She has Cerebellar Hypoplasia- it makes her wobbly, and sometimes she can't cat correctly.

"dvpbo00","**Your personal finances are the entire family's business.** This doesn’t just pertain to daughters, but my father made it clear that we (my siblings, myself, and my mom) were all financial burdens, but also made it clear that how much money we had was none of our business if we ever asked. He didn’t say we were burdens explicitly, but after hearing him yell at my mother over and over again about how she shouldn’t have bought any food for us, that she shouldn’t have bought us underwear, it became very clear to all of us that we were just a waste of money to him. 

I think that in most cases it is preferable to not worry your pre-teen children about finances at all, but in our case, where money was always an issue, I think it would have been nice to explain what was going on. Making a family budget that we are all aware of and making known what the long term goals are (getting rid of debt, buying a house, etc) would have made us all more accepting of the sacrifices we had to make throughout our lives. Unfortunately, when we did finally learn what some of my dad’s financial goals were, it became clear that my father never did anything to make those goals reality, so all of our sacrifices were not only unappreciated, but also all for nothing. I’m 21 now and learned recently that despite the fact that from 2012-2016 my family got to live in a house that was fully paid for (i.e. we did not have to pay rent, only utilities), and despite the fact that I had moved out in 2014, my dad didn’t use that time to pay off his debt or make a savings at all, and to this day he is still drowning in credit card debt.

**You should not treat your daughters extremely differently than your sons.** My father always discouraged me from playing sports, and in general both of my parents discouraged me from doing any extra curricular activities, but my younger brother was pushed from a young age to play soccer and run around outside. While my sisters and I were always made to feel that our clothing, hygiene products, and food were wastes, my brother’s clothing, shoes, hygiene products, and food were necessities because he was a “growing boy.” Additionally, my two sisters and I loved to play video games whenever we got the chance, but those chances were few and far between because my father thought video games were only for boys. The most infuriating bit was being expected to do all the chores, and even do favors for the men of the house, while my father and brother sat and watched tv. My brother was never expected to cook his own food, or even make his own bowl of cereal, wash his clothes, or wash his dishes, but my sisters and I were made to do these things by the age of 7. It was strange to have these gender roles enforced at home and then be surrounded by friends and acquaintances at school who had no such limitations, and it ultimately just made me resentful.

**The way you treat your wife is how your daughters will expect to be treated by their SO’s.** Thanks to my parents awful forms of communication (read: only yelling, lecturing, and lying to avoid the former), and as a result of the way they raised us, my siblings and I all became “people-pleaser” types. I couldn’t stand up for myself, and eventually this led to me getting into a relationship in my freshmen year of high school (didn’t know how to say no, I’ve learned now). That relationship turned into a two-year long living nightmare for me, and I felt like I had no adults that I could turn to for help about it. My older sister had a similar experience that turned out much worse for her, as her first relationship turned into a stalker experience. Rather than feel comfortable going to my parents for help, she kept it all a secret, and when it all came out my dad beat her.

My parents have never felt like parents, mentors, guardians, or anything at all for me. They just existed to provide a very bare minimum of food, drive us to school, and provide money only when absolutely needed, such as for a medical bill. I would suggest to any father to actually speak to your children, learn what they like, and encourage them to do the things they like. **Having a full-time job does not excuse you from being a member of the family,** so volunteer to cook dinner, help wash the dishes, show that you are in this together, even if you are tired. Don’t be a background parent, don’t just ask your kids “what did you eat?” and go watch TV for the rest of the night, every night, and then wonder why none of your children speak to you or want to be around you. 

I saw some people respond to this question talking about how they would prefer their dad’s presence over the financial security he provided them, well I would argue the complete opposite. I would prefer absent but responsible parents that could be trusted to provide for their kid’s needs over having parents present and friendly but not capable of providing even food and shelter. And yes, despite all I wrote, which was most of the negatives, my parents were often sociable and friendly, making their neglect all the more confusing. Most of our meals came from free breakfasts/lunches at our public schools. Housing came from extended family helping us out. Clothing came from aunts and cousins giving us hand-me-downs. My siblings dread having our parents home on vacations or after they come home from work, and we would all prefer workaholic parents over what we have now. My siblings and I have such a poor relationship with our parents that starting about 5 years ago, we just started calling them “the parents.” It’s gotten to the point where I feel weird saying “my parents.” Don’t let it get this bad.",1521057844,"i would prefer absent but responsible parents that could be trusted to provide for their kid’s needs over having parents present and friendly but not capable of providing even food and shelter.","present and friendly","friendly",NA,FALSE,"present and friendly","present",NA,NA,0

"dv48522","&gt; So I get the feeling that you'd like a return to the Garrison model where we can just sit around waiting on missions never having to go out into the world -- which, obviously, Blizzard is never going to go back to. Legion specifically had quite a few specific design choices moving away from that model, and I can assume BfA will continue in that direction -- although now that we ARE farther away from Garrisons, maybe they could revisit things like resource missions or extensive champion leveling/gearing -- however I actually didn't mind the Legion model.

I don't just want to sit in a garrison and do nothing, I'm *just* referring to the missions system. I want to go out into the world because there's shit to do, not to force me out there so I can do more missions. World Quests, Rep, AP, etc were good incentives. Forcing me out there for resources? Not so much.

&gt; Ok so not to be to snide here or, but I've not had much of an issue keeping my alts stocked with OHR

I'm not really either, but I had to use thousands of bloods to get there. The average player is not going to have this luxury of having so many bloods stockpiled on a main/alts and will falter greatly. I get people asking me every day (in regards to the spreadsheet I've made) how I keep my resources high, and I answer them ""because I was an Herbalist Alchemist and had 1200+ bloods with nothing to spend them on until the Potion of Prolonged Power was introduced"". That's not a viable answer, and I end up having to tell them you have to grind them out via WQs and stuff.

&gt; I wish there were ways to speed it up -- like maybe trading OHR in for an equipment crate, or maybe world quests would sometimes reward champion crates. Waiting on missions just to unlock new gear, and then to wait on RNG armor token missions (WHY DID MY ROGUE GET TO 950 BEFORE MY PRIEST WHO WAS AT 925 WAY BEFORE?!)

This would make grinding resources actually feel worth it because then you're going out doing the WQs for GEAR, not for resources to keep your waiting mini-game afloat. Work Orders would be fine if they were instantaneous, but we live in the world of Blizzard wants you paying, not playing (and enjoying) in regards to this.

&gt; However I do think it's kind of cool that each class has specific strengths or weaknesses

I'd like it if it's small, but just one look at that tab on the spreadsheet I linked tells you of the absolute dumpsterfire that it really is. It's horribly imbalanced right now. Specific classes have a huge advantage over others when it comes to maximizing the Order Hall. 20% Reduction and 18h WQ classes are way better. Classes with both (Mage, Warlock, Warrior) are even higher up. Mage and Warlock also have a 20% Reduction Champ and both also have Healing Items. While Warriors also have the big two (20% Reduction T2 and T5 Freebie WQs), they have an awful champion pool and don't have healing items, but are still a huge outlier.

&gt; I dunno, I don't think it's a bad think to have to login or go back to a main area/hub/whatever to take care of stuff like troops or research or whatever. Though I LOVE the argus mission table, combined with the app it's been great. OTOH the more pressing annoyance is the interplay between the crucible and the artifact forge. It gets super annoying running back and forth.

Point 3 was small but I don't see a reason why you can't. It does nothing but add padding/backtracking when you're in the middle of actually playing the game and having fun and missions pop and you have to go back, or literally exit the game so you can... do it on your phone instead. That just makes no sense.

&gt; Having the bodyguard not count against the limit would work too imo.

That would be nice, but I still think it feels awkward having these awesome lore characters doing literally nothing because they're ""inactive"". No reasoning as to why you can't have them, and they're still in the order hall, just... they don't do anything.

&gt; I actually think you're writing off the Rep tokens too easily.

I don't really feel like the tokens are worth the time/resources to get just for Paragon caches though (unless you really want the vanity stuff/don't have all your leggos yet). As someone who has all their leggos/all reps exalted, yeah they're not a horrible option. I just make most players who only have 1 toon and aren't collecting everything.

&gt; I also personally run pet charm missions, though atm I'm just stockpiling, occasionally burning any over 10k on level stones.

I did too, until I collected well over 6k and nothing to spend them on. Hoping they're worth a damn in BfA.

&gt; I would counter this though in general by pointing out that is rewarding just gold (after a certain point) a bad thing? It means that once BfA is released, we'll have no reason to be running Legion missions in perpetuity like many of us still do with Garrisons (at least on my tailors). I realized that after Legion missions get nerfed, I can walk away and not worry about missing out on anything.

I mean, no. I'm not saying  they should be relevant post-Legion but I feel like just having gold as the only true focus doesn't feel as fun.

Also, Garrisons are still good for any character. Scribe Huts can craft Cards of Omen.

&gt; OTOH, those rare WoD missions were really cool, it would have been cool if we had had something similar. Though I guess we sort of had stuff, like Corgnelius, the heirloom ammy from some point in argus (I did the damn chain 13 times, I don't remember where it came from).

Having them be super RNG was an awful feeling though. I remember when the SELFIE camera came out and my mission didn't pop up for like a month. Feltbadman.

&gt; I'd be wary over how they'd balance it though. Personally I'd rather keep -20% duration on my Druid then get an infernal, y'know?

Ooh now there's a choice, but I'd rather just have both like a lot of classes have at the moment ;)

I mean, if Blizzard is going to stick to this ""barely play the game"" attitude because ""most players don't have time to play"", makes sense to give everyone a freebie WQ a day.

&gt; So anyway I will say that having taken my alts through Argus, and now as I slowly wait for the armor token RNG missions to show up so I can get everyone to 950 and start running gear missions---

Oh, you haven't been through that yet on ~12 toons? That's when resource management gets AWFUL and it's been my main point of contention for the grind.

&gt; I do wish some aspects were more alt friendly, but OTOH, I feel like I'm getting some great loot.

Outside of gold, do you really feel that way? I really, really, don't. This has all been about nothing more than gold at this point.

&gt; Also, for whatever it's worth, being ""forced"" to play my alts have gotten me more invested in them than WoD where I had a few that were basically just garrison zombies who never left.

&gt; 1 Resource maintenance and The Grind

So I get the feeling that you'd like a return to the Garrison model where we can just sit around waiting on missions never having to go out into the world -- which, obviously, Blizzard is never going to go back to. Legion specifically had quite a few specific design choices moving away from that model, and I can assume BfA will continue in that direction -- although now that we ARE farther away from Garrisons, maybe they could revisit things like resource missions or extensive champion leveling/gearing -- however I actually didn't mind the Legion model. 

Ok so not to be to snide here or, but I've not had much of an issue keeping my alts stocked with OHR -- I have a 12 as well, plus 1 opposite faction, with a couple more on their way -- maybe, not sure about a lightforged space goat -- I took advantage of blood hunter early on, my alts were wearing heirloom shoulders basically right up into 7.3, and I have abused the crap out of the profession recipe world quests (every time a tailoring WQ is up that rewards my maxed out tailor with 10 BoS, I actually get 40 total from using my alts that don't even know any Legion patterns) -- I also made the trade off early on to not use BoS for much crafting or later trading in for mats, I decided I'd rather not run out of OHR. Oh and to be fair 2 of my alts lucked out with +300 OHR bodyguard gear.

Now it was/is a grind for damn sure, I finally pushed through and took 13 alts through argus, and holy crap was that annoying as hell (STOP TALKING JUST MOVE/OPEN THE PORTAL/GIVE ME THE NEXT QUEST t.t). Likewise the trickle of new gear is also super frustrating, I wish there were ways to speed it up -- like maybe trading OHR in for an equipment crate, or maybe world quests would sometimes reward champion crates. Waiting on missions just to unlock new gear, and then to wait on RNG armor token missions (WHY DID MY ROGUE GET TO 950 BEFORE MY PRIEST WHO WAS AT 925 WAY BEFORE?!)

So, I think we just need to accept that we won't likely see a return of resource missions -- although, BoS missions existed for a decent amount of time into 7.3 so maybe BfA might relent, especially now that we're so far from Garrisons. I think the goal is to not end up back where you don't have to play your character but still be making a ton of loot.

&gt;  2 Classes should not be different (mechanically)

I sort of agree here, I find myself missing the instant-free-complete on my alts who don't have them, or the healy tokens on my lesser played alts that help me save OHR by keeping good troops alive where instead they just have to let the argus troop die because I want the gold.

I sort of think that as Legion went on, Blizzard came to agree which is why the new research they added to Order Halls were the same for everyone. However I do think it's kind of cool that each class has specific strengths or weaknesses -- though sometimes it falls flat, like the Monk's ""random troop upgrades"" (I think I've proced it like twice), or the absurdly long research time for a one-heart boss counter troop... Or, the trade off I suppose in maining a druid for me is -20% and hearts, where as my DK has an instant WQ complete, and OP-as-fuck T2 troops (I still use them all the time on my farmer DK whose champions are all geared out).

&gt;  3 Allow players to use the mission table anywhere

I dunno, I don't think it's a bad think to have to login or go back to a main area/hub/whatever to take care of stuff like troops or research or whatever. Though I LOVE the argus mission table, combined with the app it's been great. OTOH the more pressing annoyance is the interplay between the crucible and the artifact forge. It gets super annoying running back and forth.

&gt;  4 Allow players to use all of their followers

So I'd say most classes are only benching 3 champions (Mage/Pally being outliers with ""extras""), and since some of them aren't that great (Matron, ha) it's not as bad as it was when we were locked at 5 (or 4 if using a bodyguard). I think this was a result of the Blizzard absurd swing in the opposite direction (ie: too many daillies in MoP? ok WoD has none!)

Having the bodyguard not count against the limit would work too imo. Oh and personally as fun/op as Meatball is, I really hope we don't see him again in BfA or another like him -- because I think that contributed to the frustration, because he was so OP you could only choose 4 or 3 champions.

&gt;  5 Make missions more rewarding outside of gold

I actually think you're writing off the Rep tokens too easily. For me they were actually a big focus for all of legion, mainly to help my alts get their Order Hall transmog sets (even the ones I don't like, heh), and more recently I started funneling the tokens to a human alt for paragon bags -- ended up with about 10k OHR I think, this DMF he'll have a month's worth of tokens to redeem, curious to see how much loot he gets in total.

I also personally run pet charm missions, though atm I'm just stockpiling, occasionally burning any over 10k on level stones.

I think the AP missions do suck though, I sometimes run the command center AP missions, but meh.

I would counter this though in general by pointing out that is rewarding just gold (after a certain point) a bad thing? It means that once BfA is released, we'll have no reason to be running Legion missions in perpetuity like many of us still do with Garrisons (at least on my tailors). I realized that after Legion missions get nerfed, I can walk away and not worry about missing out on anything.

OTOH, those rare WoD missions were really cool, it would have been cool if we had had something similar. Though I guess we sort of had stuff, like Corgnelius, the heirloom ammy from some point in argus (I did the damn chain 13 times, I don't remember where it came from).

&gt;  6 Make that ""complete a free WQ every 18 hours"" order hall trait a permanent thing for ALL classes

I'd be wary over how they'd balance it though. Personally I'd rather keep -20% duration on my Druid then get an infernal, y'know? Though I've been working on his Prestige, and I am so sick to death of the Murloc one with it's low respawn which I'd kill to drop an infernal on so... ha

&gt;  That said, this is essentially point #2, but I really want to keep the 18h freebie WQ trait going into BfA. It's awesome and should totally be kept. Hell it's half the reason I'm able to keep my 12 toons' Order Halls operating daily without being completely starved on resources or burning myself out on the game.

I feel like, though, for those of us with a dozen alts it shouldn't really be as easy as it was back in WoD. In Legion sure we'll reach a point where the alt's will have geared champions and such, but you still have to make the effort to keep OHR coming in. I personally had been planning on this since the beginning. Like I mentioned I made sure everyone had blood hunter, I abused the profession recipe WQs, now in 7.3 I'll do quick Argus WQs for OHR -- today my main still has nearly 1k BoS, which means I don't actually HAVE to go out and do OHR WQs, but I still make the attempt for alts running low. This gives me the option to use bloods on OHR, or trade in for some mats like when I was still making feasts (they caught on sadly, no more jacking up the price, it's a race to the bottom :( bah).

So anyway I will say that having taken my alts through Argus, and now as I slowly wait for the armor token RNG missions to show up so I can get everyone to 950 and start running gear missions I do wish some aspects were more alt friendly, but OTOH, I feel like I'm getting some great loot. In retrospect it did give me something to work towards -- still working towards really -- and now that they're all through Argus I can start leveling a new allied race alt and start the grind all over again!

Also, for whatever it's worth, being ""forced"" to play my alts have gotten me more invested in them than WoD where I had a few that were basically just garrison zombies who never left. So far I've actually played my Warrior as non-prot, learned I hate Fury, Arms is fun, but I still miss Gladiator. Maybe it's just me?

**Size:** 4 Years, 2 Seasons, Rank 6, 10-15 active members. 

I would describe our clan as casual *plus* group of social and active Destiny veterans. We play Destiny 2 first and foremost for the social aspects. Help each other out with milestones and raid mostly on the weekends. We predominantly communicate/coordinate through the PSN and Destiny Companion apps. No third party apps required. We keep it positive and friendly, but are not blind to D2’s issues. Like most other D2 clans, we were hit pretty hard by inactive players after the CoO DLC. 

**Looking for a few guardians who still actively play Destiny. Also, if there are any small clans out there interested in merging into us, we are open to discussion, as well.**

**Clan description from bungie.net:** 

&gt; Excellent Adventures: Adults juggling real life with playing video games. Work, school, family, and significant others. Mature, and welcoming. Weekly milestones, raids and more! We are a US-based PS4 clan of adult-age gamers. You know how it goes and so do we. We strongly encourage you to be active, social and engaged. As life permits, of course. Above all else, be excellent to each other.",1516722012,"we keep it positive and friendly, but are not blind to d2’s issues.","positive and friendly","friendly",NA,FALSE,"positive and friendly","positive",NA,NA,0

One time I ended up fighting with her friends and she chose me over them and from time to time, I still feel bad about myself for not being so sociable and friendly.

"dsuem7p","See, I always try to be as good of a person I can be to others, I look them in the eyes when I'm talking to them or them to me, I let them talk too and ask question about themselves.. Often I even try to ask open questions, but many don't seem to go further.. Also no one ever texts me or calls me first, I'm always the one that has to.. but like always always! Fun thing is though, it's not like they try to stop the conversation asap. They sometimes continue it themselves and answer with decently sized answers.""

I might be wrong but one possible idea about what is going on here... you put a lot of effort into masking at first that isn't sustainable in the medium or long term and also doesn't allow you to show much actual personality(since your primary effort is, rather than in expressing who you are, being spent on the masking effort).
So you give off a friendly but bland impression at first which
doesn't actually interest anyone but also doesn't make them inclined to reject you, but that minimal impression slips eventually.

Like I said, I could be wrong and I am also likely somewhat biased here(if I could go back in time, one of the things I would tell my younger self is to not put any effort at all into masking) but thought I would suggest it to at least give you another possibility. If this is the case you could try to drop all pretense of 'normality', still try to be as good a person as you can but you can be kind and friendly without trying to fake eye contact or anything like that and in fact the effort of trying to do stuff that makes you look 'normal' can actively take away from mental resources that you could instead spend on finding ways to be actively kind and friendly(even if in what will come across as a 'strange' manner). Try to show more of your actual self, express your interests even while trying to get other people to open up about theirs and so potentially have more in-depth conversations, etc.

The predicted pattern if you try this is that you'll experience a lot more outright rejection in the initial stages but that when/if you do find people who stick by you through that they will be much more likely to be longer-term real friendships. One cautionary note is you might also come across people who pretend to be friends to make fun of you later or take advantage of you if you come across as vulnerable so reading about things like signs you're being manipulated and how to watch out for people who want to take advantage of one(there are lists of signs for this online of varying degrees of reliability).

Sorry if I'm off here or this is useless and annoying advice, hope it helps in some way though.",1516235402,"so you give off a friendly but bland impression at first which doesn't actually interest anyone but also doesn't make them inclined to reject you, but that minimal impression slips eventually.","friendly but bland","friendly","but",FALSE,"friendly but bland","bland",NA,NA,1

Some individual Time Lords are kind and friendly, but overall they have an awful reputation. They are classist, and treat their peasant class as if they don't matter. They consider humans and other races to be completely insignificant, almost like animals. At certain points in their history they were known for scooping these ""lesser races"" out of time and forcing them to fight to the death for sport. They refuse to intervene in other planets' affairs, even if it would be very easy to help. If other races even set foot on Gallifrey their memories are wiped and they are dropped unceremoniously back into their time line.

"dskc9lm","My experience with MDMA turned my life around in a sense, fundamentally changing my approach to everything. I grew up friendly but extremely introverted. MDMA in a social setting allowed me to see what it must be like to have energy, to want to interact with people, and helped me to be more honest with myself and others about who I was and my depression. Now I tend more to the extrovert side of the spectrum and the lessons I learned and things I saw myself do while on MDMA turned me into what people tell me is a wonderful person -- especially my mom who's amazed by my turnaround.

"dsaz011","Wompanu. If you need to know more, here: It is called a Wompanu, (nicknamed Stalkers due to their unique look) and it is a species I made with the power of imagination. (insert sponge bob here) They do not chew their food, but rather suck it, due to their mouth having 8 teeth in a circle. They are mostly friendly, but quite scary looking. Their nose is 2 tiny holes slightly above their mouth and their ears are slightly bigger holes on the two sides of their head. They can understand humans, and could speak English but their mouth shape prevents it so they whistle to talk instead. Their fur consists of all reddish for females ,and all shades and brownish for males. They are scavengers, so they eat dead animals. They have retractable claws as long as a human finger and they mostly live in jungles, though they can survive in forests. Their ears are like elf ears but have a v shaped split at the top, but this feature is not on the females, and they just have the ears with no split. They cannot be kept as a pet due to their high intelligence but can be interacted with. They have 8 eyes surrounding their mouth in a circle and they like to climb trees and watch weak animals so they can eat their dead body. The males are usually bigger, and they gather food in their mouth, then spit it out like a candy straw for the young ones to eat. The younger ones eat that food and survive for about 12 years with their family, and they can live to around 150 years. When they are born they do not have claws, and their ears are drooped down. All the species has a little patch of light fur on their stomach like a monkey. Their speed is about 5 miles faster than a cheetah and they are about as strong as humans, and as tall too. They can stand up, or run on all fours. If provoked, you better FREAKING RUN! They have tails similar to monkeys, but have 1 spike on the end. 
My fursona is a unique version, however, and has 2 daggers, a black hoodie with Slicer written in blocky, gray letters, since that is his name, and has camo pants with black and red tennis shoes. His eyes are blue, and most of our species eye color is red, green, and yellow, and blue is rare. His fur is black, but the light stomach patch is grayish. He has a blue tongue and a grayish tail, but darker than his stomach. 4 of his eyes are actually gray (the four corners) and his teeth are all extra white. His personality is short tempered, but always trying to help. He is fast and has average strength and above average wisdom, AND NO HES NOT ANYTHING OTHER THAN STRAIGHT! HE is mostly quiet, and very sneaky but truthful. He is loyal and very energetic. When he runs, he has a super speed burst, but then slows down greatly because of how far he just went. He is very brave and clumsy, and he has a certain view on the government. His fur is otherwise rough, and he is very friendly, but all it takes is a couple of wrong moves and could burst. He has tortures ( not the kind where you cuss, but the tics kind), OCD, and ODD. He hates cussing, smoking, etc. His religion is strongly Christian and he can be pretty brutal at times.

"dsalayn","I had a somewhat similar situation once. I inherited two cats. One was nice and friendly, but the other was implacably hostile. She would not even stay in the same room with me. If I came near, she'd hiss and spit, then run away. This went on for weeks. Finally in desperation I put their food dish in the kitchen three times a day and sat in the doorway on a low stool. So if she wanted to eat, she had to pass within a couple feet of me. She had a choice of coming near me or starving to death. So we're playing for very high stakes, right? She held out for a day and a half, then there was this furry blur that went past me at the speed of light and there she was eating and growling simultaneously, letting me know what she thought of me. And so it went for weeks, but she ran past me slower and slower and finally just walked past with a token hiss or two. Slowly my right hand began a journey down to the floor where she had to step over it. Then that pesky hand slowly reached up and sort of petted her as she went past. Then one day, one wonderful day, I was immersed in a book I was reading ... and suddenly, there came the Head Bonk ... you know, where they bonk you with their heads as a sign of affection. I looked down at her in astonishment and she looked up at me and meowed plaintively and I started petting her in earnest and she PURRED ... I couldn't help it, I started crying. After all this time, she was saved from a life of loneliness and anger, she would now begin soaking up the love and affection that she deserved. From then on, everything was just fine.

"ds111dt","For not tipping due to rude service...  I've literally never had an experience with a rude server, no matter what kind of restaurant it was.  Whenever we eat out, we are always polite and friendly (but not the obnoxiously familiar kind of friendly) and we don't complicate things with wanting customized meals and constant requests for this, that, or the other.  We thank them for everything they do, whether it's filling a glass or taking a plate away.  Is it a coincidence that we've never had anyone be rude to us?  Probably not. :)

It seems to me that people whose daily pay relies so heavily on tips could never be rude to diners without great provocation... and when I see other diners being demanding and obnoxious and narcissistic, I think their servers deserve great credit for handling things as gracefully as they do.  I've never been a server myself, but whenever someone starts complaining to me about supposed bad service they had, I'm always inclined to take the other side and think I'm not hearing the full/correct story.

"drs9ct2","&gt;Bayley was nice and friendly but has a limit. She had fire and passion. She was feisty and had a stern but fair mean-streak whilst also being that lovable woman that people adore. She was an intelligent, fighting champion. She was basically a modern brunette, slightly more childish Artouria Pendragon (Saber) but without the king complex and the sword.

I don't want her to have a mean streak. That doesn't feel compatible with being nice and friendly and lovable to me.

&gt;Also Bayley winning the title at WrestleMania against Ice Queen, PPV streak Charlotte is the much better option. 

That would be cool but there's nothing wrong with her winning it before. For me the excitement isn't in her winning the title and ending the streak at Mania, it's her winning the title, period. Whenever it happened would make me esctatic.

As for the rest of your post, I don't really want to see Bayley grow up and mature and be more aggressive. I just want her to be the lovable, adorable, innocent fangirl forever and be beloved by everyone for that alone. That's the version I love at least, the best form of her and one I enjoy the most and feels most true to her. I love seeing her as champion, but I don't think it's worth it if it means she changes from that initial form.

Maybe it's just people think of her as a character in a narrative, I'd rather just treat her like an ordinary person just exisiting without any need for an arc. I just want her to stay the same child-like Bayley and still be beloved by everyone instead of growing into a young woman or adult, I don't want her to lose that adorable innocence.

"drs8ma5","That's fine and all. But I understand what everyone else is saying. I don't think they've given up on her. I also think that she's still over despite what everyone says. But her booking against Alexa (At least after Payback) was a travesty.

Bayley was nice and friendly but has a limit. She had fire and passion. She was feisty and had a stern but fair mean-streak whilst also being that lovable woman that people adore. She was an intelligent, fighting champion. She was basically a modern brunette, slightly more childish Artouria Pendragon (Saber) but without the king complex and the sword.

I don't really care about the promos. I fucking hate how people keep crying and whining about promos. They act like she forgets her lines on the reg. It's ridiculous.

But they did ruin what I think was a potentially great character with the build up to Extreme Rules and Extreme Rules itself. I had nothing against Alexa winning the feud, but to me that was NOT Bayley.

Also Bayley winning the title at WrestleMania against Ice Queen, PPV streak Charlotte is the much better option. Even better would be playing the long game that WWE hates doing because their lazy and are not great storytellers (Vince is not a great storyteller and doesn't have a great judge on character building. I bet if Vince let the writers do their jobs we'd be getting something more consistent) and have Bayley lose at Mania, take a couple more loses from other women, like Nia, or Alexa, Mickie, maybe even have Sasha turn on Bayley (basically Bayley hits rock-bottom) and have her learn from that experience, and fight back against her doubters and eventually becoming champion as a more wiser and mature individual.

The problem with Main roster booking and storylines, is that they don't really think about what happens next. People say that Bayley's arc ended in NXT but it didn't. At least I don't think it did at the time.

Think about it this way. Bayley was that loveable, adorable, innocent naïve fangirl on NXT. She was basically a child. Her doubters (Sasha and Charlotte and other women) said that she was too nice to be Champion. But she wouldn't allow that to shake her confidence, and set out to prove her doubters wrong and ended up earning Charlotte's respect in their match, which she lost. That was the 1st arc.

Then came the second arc. Bayley learns from that one experience with Charlotte and gains a bit of a mean-streak. Not the kind that you're thinking. But a mean-streak where she steps up the aggression and has champion's mentality. She ends up beating Sasha for NXT Women's title, and then goes from being that kid character to being a smart, kind, still lovable but stern and aggressive young woman. She's gets smarter and more intelligent every time she defended the NXT title and then ran into Asuka, who was simply better in every way and that led to Bayley's downfall. There is always someone better and in that case for Bayley that someone was Asuka.

Then comes the Main Roster. The next arc. Which in my opinion should have being about Bayley growing up into an adult woman. Getting wiser, smarter and more mature as a veteran wrestler. Still loveable, but more mature.

But we didn't get that. Instead they ended up moving backwards, reverting Bayley back to her child-like fangirl self and making her look stupid in the process.",1514311829,"bayley was nice and friendly but has a limit.","nice and friendly","friendly",NA,FALSE,"nice and friendly","nice",NA,NA,0

 Lady friend picked me up, had a good night, and she drove me to work in the morning.

Instead of having her pick me up today (about an hour round trip, I live in the sticks) I had a co-worker drop me off at Wal-Mart. I have some shopping to do so I ask for an oil change. Get my father a new TV for Christmas, he's going to love it. Get some food for dinner. Its cheat day so biscuits and gravy it is. Lady will love it.

Must have thought I did and forgot. This was about a year ago I think. So I didn't pay it and missed my court date. Failure to appear. Well I've been driving around with a warrant the last couple of months. Ended up having to call my lady friend to come bail me out. Bond was only $300. But still had to wait in jail for almost five hours.

The cop was very friendly, but young.. Turns out he had only been a cop since September. I don't think he realized a small bond like that is pretty unnecessary. Obviously I didn't do anything major and could probably take care of it over the phone. He sure got his balls busted by the cops who had to do all the paperwork to book me, and then immediately put me out on bond. 

But he did let me put all my stuff in the car. So the food has just been sitting in the back seat. I do live in a small town high in elevation in Colorado, so it was cold out. But I probably won't eat it. I definitely missed out on cheat day. Now I'm up 24 minutes passed my bed time because I ate too late (still had mac n cheese, but no biscuits and gravy) and have too much energy. Work will be no fun tomorrow.

"dq8cmhx","Projected costs depend largely on the kind of speaker you want. Assuming you already own all equipment needed for making the cabinets, good bookshelves can be build for well under $100 per speaker. Large floorstanders off course require more wood and a lot more cost will go into the finish. I guess somewhere between $100 to $250 a speaker will get you  well on your way.
Should a person built something themselves? That is quite a difficult question to give just one answer to. In short: If you think building it will be a hassle and don't consider it fun. Then don't do it! If you think it'll be fun to build, have the equipment and are handy / willing to learn  woodworking you'll certainly be able to build something budget friendly, but good sounding by yourself. The difficulty of the build and with that the chance of not messing up and getting something that actually sounds top notch depends on what kind of speaker you want to build. If you are in a smal (bed)room or listening from a desk with the speakers in front of you, a small ported box with a 4"" speaker and a tweeter will do great. And that is quite an easy thing to built with tons of examples online. But in a large room wanting something that really packs a good punch with great clarity (transmission line or a 3-way system). The enclosure is quite a bit more difficult to get right. A semi large 2-way system with a 6 or 8"" woofer for example is not much more difficult to built than a small bookshelf speaker. So that might be a good starting point. The first time round you might not get the enclosure perfect and it might not sound the best it could. But hell the speaker will work and prob won't sound horrible, so you can always build a better enclosure for it down the line.",1511435110,"if you think it'll be fun to build, have the equipment and are handy / willing to learn  woodworking you'll certainly be able to build something budget friendly, but good sounding by yourself.","friendly, but good","friendly","but",TRUE,"friendly , but good","good",NA,NA,1

&gt; What made you choose to go with Manjaro over other distros?

Well it's not as if I dislike other distros, it's just closer to my needs: For example I like running up-to-date software and I see having a rolling distro as a plus for me because I like not caring about implications of major updates. So with those two points I'm really narrowing down my pool. I tried Arch and found that it's OK but doesn't feel as polished as Manjaro. Here's why:  
- For example Manjaro has a little hardware tool for selecting your drivers; I find that extremely handy. Or it has it's own little GNOME extension for checking majaro updates.  
- It's following Arch's releases but it's about 1 or 2 weeks behind in order to test properly. I like that because 1-2 weeks is good enough time to test and not too long so they would be considered ""old"" packages.

I don't wanna bore you so here are the main points I like Manjaro overall (for example vs *buntu family):

- **Pacman** feels much faster than apt-get.  
- **AUR** is a more elegant solution that multiple PPAs. Easier to have 1 tool for all community packages.
- Can make use of the excellent **Arch wiki** (but also has a very nice Manjaro wiki to complement)
- Feels both polished and up-to-date.
- Anecdotal, but never broke for me.

"doxpab9","I wore a suit and tie. Guy next to me hand on khakis and a striped button up. Another guy also had on a suit and tie. The judge approved everyone for a “target and hunting” license. 

The mood was ok. The judge called a handful of landlord tenant dispute cases before she got to us. I would say this took less than hour but there were a few no shows. When she called us up she was friendly but also stern. She said she would explain any questions we had. Again, she only asked us why we needed the license. When I said all “hunting and shooting and all legal” purposes she seemed pretty dismissive and made it seem like I was not going to get that without some extenuating circumstances. 

Maybe a visiting judge would be more open to unrestricted carry if he comes from a county that gives them more liberally. ",1509052260,"when she called us up she was friendly but also stern.","friendly but also","friendly","but",FALSE,"friendly but also stern","stern",NA,"also",1

**Part 1:**

I gently dominate you and use kind JOI to get you in the mood and ready to go. I suck on my realistic dildo while telling you how to touch yourself for me, teasing you (and myself) through my clothes. Once you cum for me I instruct you to put it away for later ;) 

**Part 2:**

Again with gentle JOI and domination, I sensually strip down and start playing with myself, tasting my juices - enticing you to taste your own! I tease you a lot, with glimpses of my wet pussy as I play with myself to completion. I tell you to coat your tongue in your cum for me right before we explode together (you for the second time!) ;)

    A shimmering surface of cold water - held in an immense, free
    standing, white enamelled bathtub with gilded lion's legs -
    bulges in SLOW MOTION to the chords of Handel's ""Trumpet
    Volunteer"".

    A head emerges.

    White gloved hands, in livery, rush to envelope the surfacing
    naked wet body in white towels.


2   INT.    DRESSING CHAMBER, YORK HOUSE - DAY                        2

    The ritual continues with crisp military precision.

    CLOSE ON the Royal Coat Of Arms stamped in gold: lion and
    unicorn embrace a shield divided into four quarters with harp,
    thistle, and more lions denoting England, Ireland, Scotland and
    Wales. The shield is surmounted by a crown.

    This emblem is on a cuff-link fastened on a starched white
    shirt.

    Trousers, pressed to a knife-edge, are held for stockinged feet
    and gartered legs to be inserted.

    Mirror-polished boots are laced tight.

    Jacket, held ready. Arms, shoulders, chest received.

    Glistening medals attached to front of jacket create a dazzling
    field of ribbons and medallions.

    Epaulets, edged with gold braid tassels, are adjusted.

    Polished buttons are fastened.

    Multi-coloured collar clasped shut.

    White ostrich feathers, topping a tri-corner hat, are fluffed
    and placed upon brilliantined hair.

    PAN DOWN to the handsome features of Albert, Duke of York, known
    to his family as BERTIE. He's in his late thirties, the second
    son of King George V, the reigning King of England. He conveys a
    sensitivity which appears in conflict with the manner in which
    he's been bedecked.

    Reflected in a full length mirror, Bertie tells himself:
           TKS/Seidler/09/17/08                                    3.


                             BERTIE
                   You look like a Christmas tree.

    He smiles wanly.


3   EXT.    INNER COURTYARD, YORK HOUSE, 145 PICADILLY - DAY            3

    THE ROYAL STANDARD flaps atop a gleaming chrome grill.

    Liveried footmen open the doors of a stately Austin Princess.

    Bertie exits York House with his young wife - ELIZABETH -
    considered by all to be one of the loveliest women in the land,
    truly an English rose. Golden Labradors and Corgis appear from
    all directions, weaving between them, barking boisterously,
    creating a happy chaos.

    Elizabeth and Bertie glance upwards and wave.

    Two little girls, LILIBET and MARGARET ROSE, aged eight and
    four, wave back from their nursery window.


4   INT/EXT.    AUSTIN PRINCESS, HYDE PARK CORNER - DAY                 4

    Bertie nervously lights a cigarette.    Elizabeth pats his hand.

                             ELIZABETH
                   Buck up, Bertie. The BBC said it wouldn't
                   rain.

    BERTIE'S POV - Speaker's Corner with its assortment of orators,
    prophets, protestors, and onlookers gathered around soapboxs,
    agreeing, disagreeing, shouting comments. Others carry
    placards, sing protest songs. A miners' strike is the focus of
    the day.

    A large, rather untidy workingman with a florid rosacea nose
    spots the passing Austin and stares at the occupants.

    REVERSE ANGLE - Bertie's face stares back.

    The first drops splatter against the glass.      Elizabeth sighs.

                             ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
                   Never trust the wireless.

    Bertie's face is obliterated by the increasingly heavy downpour,
    which segues into a GARGLING sound.

5   INT.    BBC BROADCASTING STUDIO - DAY                                5

    A gentleman in a tuxedo, carnation in boutonniere, is gargling
    while a TECHNICIAN holds a porcelain bowl and a towel at the
    ready. The man in the tuxedo is a BBC NEWS READER. He
    expectorates discreetly into the bowl, wipes his mouth
    fastidiously, and signals to ANOTHER TECHNICIAN who produces an
    atomizer. The Reader opens his mouth, squeezes the rubber bulb,
    and sprays his inner throat. Now, he's ready. He looks to the
    control room.

    The FLOOR MANAGER begins a count-down: five... four... three...
    two...

                             BBC NEWS READER
                   Ladies and Gentlemen: good afternoon. This
                   is the BBC National and World Programmes
                   taking you to Wembley Stadium.

    He speaks in flawless pear-shaped tones.    There's no higher
    creature in the vocal world.


6   EXT.    WEMBLEY STADIUM - DAY                                        6

    ELEVATED SHOT looking down on a sea of dripping black umbrellas
    hiding the spectators from view.

    Bertie and Elizabeth takes their places in a row of gilded
    chairs with the other dignitaries. They are:

    KING GEORGE V - a barrel-chested man with Naval beard and
    uniform, accompanied by his wife.

    QUEEN MARY - an elegant but icy grande dame.

    DR COSMO LANG - a tall, unctuous, churchman with a high, domed,
    balding head, and a perpetual expression of moral superiority.

    WINSTON CHURCHILL - a politician of sixty, as portly as Lang is
    lean. They are bantering rivals in ambition.

    STANLEY BALDWIN - the Prime Minister of the day. Heavy-browed.
    His hair, as always, parted down the middle.

    NEVILLE CHAMBERLAIN - Chancellor of the Exchequer. Tall, thin,
    lugubrious, with the expression of a quizzical chicken hawk.

    A BBC technician places a huge imposing microphone suspended on
    springs next to the stadium equipment. It looks frightening,
    even to us. Bertie's shoulders brace as though expecting a
    blow. Elizabeth sees his terror.
           TKS/Seidler/09/17/08                                  5.


                             ELIZABETH
                   Why wasn't he told?

                             COSMO LANG
                   Ten million people listening around the
                   world, Mam. Possibly more.
                       (as though Bertie didn't
                        exist)
                   His brother, and father, have been
                   broadcasting since last year.

    The King, growing impatient, hisses:

                             KING GEORGE V
                   Get on with it. Show what you're made of!

    Bertie moves forward diffidently, without an ounce of
    confidence, knowing deep within he's doomed. His stomach knots,
    chest muscles contract, constricting his breath.

                             BERTIE
                   Luh-luh-lords, la-la-ladies, gen-tell-men.

    It is a shock to realize this is a man with a profound stutter.
    A man who cannot speak in public.

    Lang whispers to Churchill.    When Lang whispers, everyone can
    hear.

                             COSMO LANG
                   I wouldn't miss His Highness' maiden voyage
                   for all the world. And on such an important
                   occasion.

    Lang really is a piece of work.

    For ease of reading, Bertie's stutter is not indicated from this
    point on in the script.

                             BERTIE
                   No doubt you wish the Prince Of Wales was
                   standing before you today.

    POV - a sea of dripping umbrellas. No response. This is going
    to be a torment for him, and his audience.


7   INT.    BBC BROADCASTING STUDIO - DAY                             7

8    EXT.    WEMBLEY STADIUM - DAY                                     8

     Bertie stands frozen, his mouth agape, jaw muscles locked. He
     knows he's considered by all, especially himself, unfit for
     public life.

     Elizabeth is devastated.

                              KING GEORGE V

     that reads: LIONEL LOGUE, SPEECH SPECIALIST.


10   INT. RECEPTION ROOM, LOGUE'S CHAMBERS, HARLEY STREET - DAY     10

     Umbrella stand, coat rack, wooden waiting bench: that's all.

     The door is flung open and Elizabeth enters, drenched, her hat
     decorated with white silk roses, now limp. A veil covers her
     features.

     She waits. Coughs.    No response.    Calls imperiously:

                              ELIZABETH
                    Are you there?

     From behind a door:

                              LIONEL (O.S.)
                    In the lav.

     Princess Elizabeth is not used to this sort of thing. She's
     further appalled by the loud gurgling of a toilet being flushed,
     and startled by the entrance of - LIONEL LOGUE. He's in his
     forties, tall, with piercing eyes and charismatic features. His
     demeanor is friendly, but professional. The accent, although
     Australian, is not heavy, he is after all a speech therapist.

Perhaps even marching across the Alps into Italy? Oh, I know! I’ll tell you ‘bout the Wendigo. Yes, I know, we had the werewolves, such as myself, and the krauts and ruskies used the damn bloodsuckers. But our neighbors to the north? They used the Wendigo. I know what you’re wondering, “What’s a Wendigo?” Well, it’s a man who’s eaten human flesh, and who’s essentially been cursed because of it. I know today the Canucks have an image of being peaceful and friendly, but in the war, they were as brutal as the ANZACs at Gallipoli. You see, the Wendigo, are as tall as a building, and have a constant taste for human flesh, a sort of never-ending blood rage. It took my entire squad to take just one down after he went rogue. And I know, if they had a constant hunger for human, how did they get transported? Well, you see, it was the Injuns who knew about the Wendigo first. They knew how to control the evil in the man, keep it at bay until need be, kind of like what I had to do. But enough about what they were like, I got an actual tale from battle. 

It was bright an early. We were prepared to land on Gold, but anything could happen, especially considering we were one of the supernatural squads. Now as you heard me earlier, we didn’t land at Gold, but rather Omaha. That happened, because one of the Canucks went Wendigo in the craft, and knocked us off course. Because we didn’t know what to do, we just wolfed up the second we landed. I know this didn’t happen at night, but we were part of an experiment to control transformations better. As we blitzed the enemy, hehe, blitzed, I saw one of those Wendigo step on a bunker, pick up a radio operator, and munch on him as he went about crushing bunkers and knocking planes out of the sky. Later, we were in the Southeast of the country, when we got ambushed by some panzers. This would’ve been a problem, had a division of Canucks not gotten lost and been in the process of asking for directions. All of a sudden, three of the beasts ran at the tanks, and threw them, literally threw them, like they were toys, after emptying the crew into their mouths like they were candy. 

Oop, looks that’s all the time we have right now kiddo. Now, don’t tell your momma that Grandpa Rudy was telling you this, she might not like you sneaking into our detention center.

I rode a couple very short sections on mex1 and while it was refreshing to do more than 6mph, boy was I glad not to be on it whole time.

I crossed at Tecate with the Baja Divide group in Jan this year and it was effortless even though I can barely string a few words of Spanish together. 

The route I did had a couple multiple day stretches without water. If you plan ahead you'll be fine and then you can refill all your bottles at a purificado for like ten pesos. Some nice boy at one even washed my filthy bottles out for me.

"dnw9jd6","(Im just gonna talk about my experience with homophobia here because I'm white, but I'm sure its a relatable experience with racism)

I feel like straight people showing no tolerance for homophobia is immensely important in creating a kinder world for gay people. In my experience, homophobia slips under the radar ridiculously easily, and a lot of people just... brush it off, so I'm kind of expected to as well even though I'm a lesbian, or I'll be ""taking them too seriously"" or ""being overly mean/politically correct"". And so I've kind of internalised it because a lot of friends of my parents are pretty homophobic and I just kind of deal with it, like oh my uncle said that gay marriage taints his marriage and that being gay is just a fetish but he's family and I don't want to start any drama, or my friend's dad makes Facebook posts about how homosexuality is disgusting and that voting yes (I'm Australian) to gay marriage is falling victim to PC culture that will force your kids into gay marriages and teach them about lesbian sex and let little boys wear dresses but he's kind enough to me when I see him (probably because he doesn't know I'm gay!), or how my dad's coworker thinks being gay is a sin and unnatural and gay people should be punished but he's a funny guy and entertaining when he comes around for drinks so what can you do really?

I think it has something to do with how ""real"" homophobes are painted to be these inherently bad people who kick puppies and destroy sandcastles and commit hate crimes when in reality the majority of homophobes are just regular people. They can seem funny and nice and friendly but still hate gay people and not want them to have equal rights, so a lot of people end up thinking ""well they're not that bad, so even though we disagree on this one thing it'd just be easier to be nice to them"" when to be honest... that sort of homophobia and outdated thinking DOES make them that bad.

I might feel this way because I have only played with groups of friends, but my stance on this didn't change when I played with/GM'd for people I didn't know who were brought in.

RPGs are inherently social experiences and the game isn't going to do anything on a group level to change how people interact, it's just going to influence what they're interacting as. If there's an important part of the game that will influence people it's the characters people create. *Supporting, friendly, but opinionated* characters are much healthier and better for a table than *lone wolf, selfish, and violent* characters.

"dnw2r7a","The Red Shirt Rule. If something bad is about to happen, but the character its going to happen to is essentially random (kraken grabs someone off the deck, bridge collapses under you, sniper with a crossbow is randomly tagging people), any given hireling or friendly but nameless NPC is twice as likely to take the bullet as any given PC.

A few of our others:

The Booze Rule: A flask of hard liquor works as a potion of healing once per long rest, but you have to roll a Con save vs poison or become drunk (as per the poisoned condition).

The Cardboard Cutout Rule: Any player who is absent for the session has their character turn into a cardboard cutout of themselves giving a thumbs up. They are incapable of succeeding at an ability check or attack or of being useful in any way, but they are also incapable of taking damage or failing a saving throw. Nobody in the game world will think this is in any way odd.

The Tempting Fate Rule: When rolling stats, if you roll in order instead of assigning them to suit your character, you get double your starting gold. You must declare you are doing it before rolling (which you do in front of everyone) and you can't take mulligans, but you don't have to pick your race and class until after you've rolled. If you do this in any system with 3d6 for stats, you are officially known as a Mad Lad.

Character Stable Rule: You can make as many characters as you want, but you can only take one on each adventure. If you have a henchperson around, you may promote them to full PC status between adventures or after your current character dies and immediately start playing as them. Once they've tasted the delights of being a real PC, though, they can't go back to henching.

The Table of Death and Dismemberment: When reduced to zero hit points, you don't automatically go unconscious. Every time you take damage that would reduce you below zero hp, you drop to zero and roll 2d6 on the table. An 8 or less generally puts you down for the count, a 7 or less temporarily maims you and might permanently scar you, a 5 or less generally means you are bleeding out, and a 2 means you are killed instantly. A 12 results in an adrenaline rush and regaining some hp. In extreme circumstances you can manage to stay fighting on death's door for several more rounds. Many of the results are negated or become less severe if you have protective gear like heavy armor or a helmet.

Group Initiative: The group picks someone to roll a d6. I roll a d6. Reroll ties. Whichever side rolls highest goes first in whatever order they see fit, then the two sides swap off for the rest of the fight. All more elaborate initiative systems are officially decreed A Waste Of Precious Gaming Time.",1507118434,"if something bad is about to happen, but the character its going to happen to is essentially random (kraken grabs someone off the deck, bridge collapses under you, sniper with a crossbow is randomly tagging people), any given hireling or friendly but nameless npc is twice as likely to take the bullet as any given pc.","friendly but nameless","friendly","but",FALSE,"friendly but nameless","nameless",NA,NA,1
"dnno39t","Heads up: this is a long one.

I was 21. He was 42. I met him working as a dancer. He frequented the club with other attorneys he associated with but was never interested in the dancers themselves. I hated the job and found his company comforting. We got to know each other and became friendly. Over time we realized we had a great deal in common, particularly our psychological idiosyncrasies resulting from similar damaging parent/child relationships. We bonded over music and pop culture and booze.

Eventually he offered me a job as a legal secretary. He had frequently mentioned that he thought I was ""too smart"" to be working in the environment I was and I assume our commonalities made him feel compelled to ""give me the chance at life"" my familial relationships didn't. At this point, I truly don't believe either of us consciously knew what we were getting ourselves into, though we ought to have.

I worked for him for a year before anything ever happened. During that time I quickly became ""one of the guys"" at the firm. We partied. A lot. I was drunk during that year far more often than I was sober. One night he turned to me and rather offhandedly said, ""You know, we could have a lot of fun together."" I knew in that moment that my answer would determine whether or not anything progressed between us. I answered selfishly. ""Yeah. We really could."" The look on his face told me my response caught him off guard. At the time I enjoyed the power I felt in that moment. Now it makes me cringe.

He was in the middle of what was looking like a divorce. I had daddy issues. He was paralyzingly intelligent and fundamentally flawed and sometimes rather cruel in his efforts to self isolate. I was fresh out of a devastating break up and consumed with a need to prove my self worth through being desired by others. It was a perfect set up for bad choices.

It started slow. He would call me on random mornings after a night of being kicked out of the house and heavy drinking. We would cuddle until our hangovers wore off and talk about anything and everything. Despite knowing this was wrong, I remember these times fondly as being beautifully intimate. Of course things progressed and we inevitably became physical. It was intense and passionate and we rather startlingly became very attached to one another.

Our relationship was often punctuated with periods of him pulling away. I know now that these were the times he and his wife were trying to work things out. I never fought to win him back. Not because I was moral or selfless but both because I knew his abandonment issues would compel him to seek me back out if he felt I ""didn't care"" that he was leaving and because I knew his affection for me made it hard for him to hurt me. I am not proud of this.

Over time the constant back and forth grew heartbreakingly exhausting. ""I love you."" ""This has to stop."" ""I miss you."" I knew that I was the other woman. I knew he married and belonged with his family. And despite of, or maybe because of, my selfishness, I didn't want to be the reason a family was dissolved. So after yet another conversation about how our relationship couldn't continue, I simply agreed. I doubt he believed my sincerity at the time. But I was firm. I didn't answer his late night calls. I stopped inviting or accepting his overtures. I think at first he was angry. Then he was grateful. 

I worked for him for another year after we broke things off and eventually left on good terms for another job. I found someone else. They know each other loosely, but my husband does not know about my history with him. That's not out of deception but rather because my husband and I have ever really probed into each other's sexual history that deeply and neither of us are interested to. He and I still see each other now and then at various functions (oh the legal industry) but our interactions are always respectful and distant. We are friendly but never inappropriate. 

He and his wife worked things out for a while, and she was made aware that he had had an affair. They never solved the underlying issues affecting their marriage and are in the midst of a ""Catholic divorce"" (they live separately but he still pays for everything and they pretend to be married). They seem amicable enough. They are not in love and I don't see them ever truly repairing their relationship, but from the outside it looks like their current arrangement is working for them and I am far from in a position to judge. 

My husband and I, though we have our own issues, are intensely loyal to each other. I have the utmost faith in him and do everything in my power to ensure that he can have the same faith in me. We do not doubt each other's fidelity.

I feel guilty about my old affair. However, I can't change it now and I'm not sure I would. We happened to be there for each other at a moment in each of our lives that we needed someone. I don't pretend to be guiltless. I knew he was married. I made my choice. I am not blameless. I was young and naive and very broken. Those aren't excuses, just facts. I learned a great deal about myself during that time and I accept responsibility for the hurts I am certain to have caused third parties. I wish him and his family the best and I don't doubt that he wishes me the same. 

It's a strange thing to feel so much shame and at the same time so much fondness for something I have done. I wouldn't call what I feel regret. Just well deserved guilt. I suppose it comes with the territory.

"dnea399","I love NYC and would encourage anyone else who thinks they love it to move here. Maybe it'll be a short love affair and maybe it'll be a long one, but I don't know anyone who regretted their sojourn here. If you're as young as you sound, well, why not move here for a few years? You can go home with a recognized certification and a few years of experience. 

Some advantages: NYC teachers make decent salaries here, relative to a lot of places, with good health and other benefits (I think the starting with a BA is about $55k now). History is less in demand, but if you're good and willing to go to a high needs school, well, it's an enormous school system and if you're dedicated I think you'll find something somewhere. High needs schools also tend to be in lower demand neighborhoods, so you may even be able to find something affordable with an easy walking or transit commute to work. It may be far from family and friends but there are direct flights to almost anywhere and people pass through here and are happy to know someone to stay with. People who live here are often interesting, lively, and friendly. 

But you did ask for cons, so here are some. Often the lower demand neighborhoods are lower demand because they are poorer, with the downsides that come with poverty, including fewer of the fun and trendy things that make NYC 'cool' in walking distance. They are further from subway stops, further from Manhattan, further from the things you probably fell in love with. A lot of the high needs schools are also high needs because they have terrible administrators who can't keep teachers. Even much cheaper housing is still not exactly cheap. If you don't live close to friends, it can be a real shlep and a pain to see them (distances on subways usually feel longer than in cars, and most people are super busy, often with gigs on top of jobs), and some people experience NYC as being a very lonely place. 

But again, why are you not able to live here? I'm not saying that you should live here. But don't make excuses. It's a thing that could happen if you prioritized enough.",1506172857,"people who live here are often interesting, lively, and friendly.","lively, and friendly","friendly",NA,TRUE,"lively , and friendly","lively",NA,NA,0

Vietnam, India and Malaysia. The TPP specifically was to make countries near China more economically dependent on America. You can argue the economics of it but it was good geopolitics.

&gt;It's decline has been afterwords. Obama definitely underestimated ISIS and the Arab Spring, which he supported facilitated its rise. It's objectively a large spot on his foreign policy.

The decline started long before January 2017.

&gt;As he described it when he was running is that it is a mix of noninterventionism and ""bomb ISIS"". But to compare it to Obama, it's a shift towards a focus on stability with a very hard line on only the most gross human rights violations.

Pretty absurd to say Trump (or any US President) has a hard line on human rights violations when he's contributing to a humanitarian crisis in Yemen. Like all American Presidents, Trump is only against dictators and human rights abuses when they go against America's interests.

&gt;I think that kind of balance is good. It's hard to be seen as tough and friendly, but I think he's been at least focused on that attitude.

He broke his promise to label China a currency manipulator yet hasn't. No trade wars have been started, it's basically a complete U-turn aside from some ranty  late night tweets against the Chinese government.

&gt;Frankly it's about time someone stood up to them and took them seriously. Ignoring them has clearly not been a working strategy.

Trump's major change to policy so far is to threaten nuclear war in public. I've yet to see how he's got a solution so far.

&gt;It's tough to call that hostile. He's certainly been critical, which they have dished as well as they've gotten, but I think it's deserved. Germany has been using a weak Euro to its trade advantage and is largely to blame with the migrant crisis that has killed so many and haphazardly caused impacts that will likely be felt for generations.

A couple points...
a. It's true the Euro is used to Germany's advantage but changing that is out of America's hands.
b. The migrant crisis, even if it did kill ""so many"", has abolsutely nothing to do with the US and to attack a nation for it is terrible geopolitics. Imagine if Britain suddenly attacked the US for its gun laws (which have led to far more deaths than Islamic terrorism in Western nations)?

I never succeeded in convincing him that feelings are the only sure path to confirmation bias.

He would ask me how I felt about something and follow up with my feelings not being true but from Satan.I guess when being confronted with a rational thinker, TSCC's only response is to trash the person and accusing them of sin and demon possession so all of their little brainwashed minions will be too frightened to try rational thinking for themselves.

They aren't illegal they are American Patriots in Waiting. The federal law you are about to link me to refers to the ACT of crossing the border as being criminal.
If fellow American Patriots in Waiting make it into this country it then becomes a civil violation (not criminal). The punishment is still the same (deportation) but it isn't criminal.

It is a nuanced difference, I know, but important if you really want to have a discussion about what to do with fellow American Patriots in Waiting who only want to build businesses, hire fellow Americans, serve in the military, pay taxes, and invest in the awesomeness that is America.

But let's be honest you are really scared of demographic, economic, and political change. I get that, no worries, it is a rational thought. It would be helpful if you would just admit that.

I've had a friendly CSR at a WM who didn't care how much VGC&gt;MO. Well, one day a co-worker or supervisor was standing behind her when I did a single transaction. The co-worker noticed how friendly and familiar the CSR was being with me. Long story short, I don't go there for my MS needs anymore.

**edit: Here's what happened...**

I guess it wasn't much of a long story at all. The next time I came in the CSR who helped me (not the friendly one) whispered something in a supervisors ear. I'm assuming it was something like ""he's the one"" because she asked me for my ID. I asked her why I needed to provide identification in order to purchase a money order. The supervisor spouted out some bullshit about some trial program going on and this particular Walmart participating. I politely declined, caught up to my wife and went shopping.

I live in Eugene, Oregon. We have a homeless/meth problem. At least twice I've been in line for a MO and I could hear mega sketchy transactions going on up at the register. Both of those times the police ended up showing up. 

I understand the supervisor wanting to fill out a SAR on me. Hell, doing as much volume as I was doing would have warranted a SAR a long time ago. I just don't want to have a SAR filled out and be told to fuck off, no more VGC&gt;MO.

"dkddi19","Neptune's character and personality wasn't the one that changed, it was the situation that changed. In VII:

1. Neptune and Nepgear went to Zero Dimension at the same time.
2. Neptune knows this time that they have more than one chance of returning to their own dimension.
3. Neptune encountered Uzume, who was tough and standoffish, but at the same time was harmless to them.
4. There was nobody picking on Nepgear in zero dimension.

As opposed to:

1. Neptune went alone, and then was left to her own devices for three years (remember the 1 day = 1 year timeflow difference?)
2. Nepgear may have possibly fucked over Planeptune for eternity with her selfishness, being sucked over to UD and possibly have wasted their only chance of returning.
3. Neptune encountered Pururut, who was warm and friendly, but at the same time was someone who gets whatever she wants because Neptune have absolutely no means of stopping her.
4. Nepgear was pretty much everybody's punching bag.

Which leads to:

1. The first conflict was the natural consequence of her messing up Neptune's return: she has to look over the kids while the other CPU's deal with Vert. She has no CPU powers anyway. Noire even called her out for being selfish. How did it resolve? Neptune gave Nepgear what she wanted by telling her that her big sis loves her. It might have been the fakest thing ever according to Junksty, but it was what Nepgear wanted.

2. Nepgear then betrays the group and goes to Vert. On top of that, it was Pururut who wanted to.... ""play"" with Nepgear. All Neptune did was not intervene, because, as pointed out before, she cannot beat Iris anyway. Nepgear more or less got what she deserved.

3. Everybody picks on her, but so do the kids. Neptune can't defend her too much without antagonizing them, because without their help Neptune and Nepgear cannot return to their dimension. Again, they were in this situation because of Nepgear.

"dkcvomb","&gt;I've been going rather tired of games

The same happened to me. I think it's because there are lots of repeated concepts nowadays. I'll suggest some games. Check out their descriptions to see if you like them!

* SOMA: sci-fi horror game. I'm not a fan of horror games, but this one was worth it. The story was great and the atmosphere was on point. It did a great job keeping me inmersed.

* Enter The Gungeon: very colorful roguelike. It's very fun, and it's my number 1 option when I want to listen to a podcast or long video while playing.

* Superhot: shooter game where time moves only when you move, so you can dodge bullets and stuff like that. Great concept, although not too long (like 2 - 3 hours long).

* Doom (2016): killing demons with metal in the background, basically. It's challenging and makes you feel badass as hell.

* Dark Souls: preferably DkS3 since it's the most beginner-friendly, but Dark Souls games are great because they make you feel like you're doing something, you can't just beat the game without much thought and you have to learn from your mistakes. Special mention because the series spoiled me in terms of bosses. Bosses in The Witcher 3 and TLOZ: Breath Of The Wild feel extremely bland in comparison.

* Rocket League: very fun multiplayer game, although I don't enjoy playing it without friends. Basically soccer but with flying cars, like if someone made FIFA fun for once.

* Terraria: the most entertaining sandbox/survival game I've played. It looks like some random minecraft ripoff at the beginning but starts to show the differences very soon in terms of content, loot, combat and bosses.

* Ori And The Blind Forest: an awesome metroidvania game that looks and sounds beautiful. I liked that there were a lot of mechanics that I hadn't seen before.

* Castle Crashers, Pit People and BattleBlock Theater: great games, all developed by The Behemoth. 

Castle crashers is a side scrolling hit 'em up. The story isn't very important (if there's any relevant story) but the game is fun to play, even more so with friends.

BattleBlock Theater is a platformer with rather good humor. More story than Castle Crashers but the center is the gameplay again.

Pit People is in Early Acess and it's a turn-based game made by the guys who made CC and BBT. I haven't played it, but The Behemoth has earned my respect as a company and I've heard it's really good.

* Even though you said you're not much into Indies, I can't stop myself from recommending you Stardew Valley. It's a game where you inherit your grandfather's farm and move to a new town to take care of it. It is a very relaxing game that helps me get rid of the tilt after losing many Overwatch ranked matches and makes the time pass as well.

* Though it's not a game, I'd recommend you to read Bioshock: Rapture by John Shirley. It narrates what happened before Rapture was built and the events leading to the city's fall. It's not 100% accurate because it came out before Infinite's Burial At Sea DLCs, but most of the book extends on the characters you already know (and probably love) from Bioshock 1, which is nice to have.",1500335740,"* dark souls: preferably dks3 since it's the most beginner-friendly, but dark souls games are great because they make you feel like you're doing something, you can't just beat the game without much thought and you have to learn from your mistakes.","friendly, but dark","friendly","but",TRUE,"friendly , but dark","dark",NA,NA,1
"dkcuzn1","I am a little confused as to whether you are asking about America and Americans in general or if you are looking for specifics about different states in the US. Assuming you want generalities about America and Americans, I would answer: 

1) Americans tend to be friendly but informal compared to other cultures. Most people will be loyal to their significant other and will care about their families. However, people will tend to only live with their immediate families rather than their extended families as might be common in other cultures. Most Americans care about humanity as a whole. Volunteer work both abroad and domestically is very common, and Americans tend to be very generous when it comes to donating to charity. 

2) Some laws are for the public good and some are to the benefit of various special interest groups. Tobacco isn't banned in the US but their are a lot of restrictions governing who it can be sold to and where tobacco can be advertised. Also, Americans don't tend to use tobacco nearly as much as people in places like Europe. Restrictions on tobacco use are for public and individual good I would say. America is more of a free market capitalist society than Europe or Canada, for instance, but there are still safety nets in place, and many people when looking at overall quality of life would say that life in America is the best on the planet (and probably among the best throughout all of human history). Quality of life is a subjective measure, of course, but America does provide a comfortable life for most of its citizens. 

3) America has lots of great scientists and engineers. The US consistently produces more scientific results and research papers than any other country. 

4) Americans value innovation and many successful businesses have been started here. Americans tend not to be intimidated by failure and are usually optimistic about improving things, so the American spirt tends to be positively disposed to innovation. Startup regulations are often more friendly than in places like Europe or Canada, but this can vary from state to state.

"dkbvbuu","I did the middle of my AFF at Texas Skydiving Center (TSC) and while the instructors were great and very friendly, I've both witnessed and heard worrisome things regarding the DZ. 

The DZO allegedly does not perform aircraft maintenance as she should, hires pilots with low fly-time and little experience.

At a TX DZ in the area, when informed I had basically begun my AFF in Lexington, I was met with uh-oh. I was unsure how to use the seat belts (no seat belts when I was at TSC), to which an instructor said, ""he's from Lexington, he doesn't know about seat belts haha"".

At another TX DZ in the area, I was advised not to jump there mainly due to the DZO not giving a damn about aircraft maintenance/pilots.

During my time as a student at Lexington I witnessed  a new pilot (old pilot died in plane crash at DZ, plane malfunctioned apparently, didn't witness this, left a few hrs beforehand, BSBD) forget to put the oil cap on the plane after adding oil, causing oil to leak out of the windshield during flight, causing an unexpected hop n pop and burning out the motor. This pilot was also dragging the tail of the 182 on the runway.

What finally deterred me from ever going back was, when informing the DZO that I would need to do a recurrency jump after about a 4 month gap between jumps, I was told that the drop zone is no longer part of the USPA so the recurrency jump was not required.

I did like the DZ, the atmosphere, and the instructors who were very knowledgeable and friendly, but I don't think I will be back for the aforementioned reasons.

"dkbkqum","&gt;Again, certain parts of America are consistently demonstrating that they have major policing issues.

It's this distancing behaviour that leads to so many of these problems. America is one country, you can't pretend that what is happening to your neighbour does not affect you. The same argument is what allowed horrible regimes to persist around the World, yet here is being used to justify horrific conditions in what was once considered the pinnacle of the free world. 

&gt;Police departments in the US are autonomous. They cooperate when it comes to crimes that cross boundary lines, the State and Fed coordinate funding and databases and whatnot, and the Staties and Feds have their own jurisdiction, but for the most part, enforcement of the law is a fundamentally local issue.
&gt;This means that you can have one city whose police force is a shit sandwich and filled with racist assholes who shoot people for funsies, while the very next city over has a wonderful police department where every officer has a degree in psychology, is perfectly trained in deescalation, and is aware of the difference between a vicious attack doggo and a friendly but distrustful doggo.


If this is where you feel the issue arises, then you should campaign against this. 

&gt;The presence of the former really doesn't impact the latter.

Except it absolutely does, as it leads to anti-police mentalities, and distrust, even with the good police departments. People move around America, the crimes of one most definitely tar the others in this regard. 

&gt;I agree, but it's that city's problem. They're a democracy, they need to fix it. They'd resent me for telling them how to police themselves, and I'd resent them if they tried to tell us how to police ourselves. After all, Hillsboro, OR is not Minneapolis, MN, and all of the different police departments are autonomous.

Yet America spent decades playing World police, yet refuses to sort out its own policing problems, which causing long term negative effects not just locally, but on global perceptions of the country. 

&gt;Let's take a really simplistic approach. Imagine that everywhere in the US is literally utopia except for one shithole city. We'll call it Gary. Everyone else in the US is fine and dandy, even with a gun for every man, woman, and child, but Gary is just awful. They end up with all of the police homicides because Gary's Finest and the gangs are shooting at each other all day long.

Let's consider a different example, one equally as ridiculous here... let's say... Nazi Germany. Most people in Nazi Germany didn't know or wouldn't even believe what was happening in the concentration camps, but that sure as shit tarred the reputation of the country in that era. Just because some people were living good safe lives doesn't mean that everything else happening is okay, and can just be put down to some ""bad apples"". Again, considering that America played World police for so long, you'd think that sorting out the ""bad apple"" police departments as you put them (and there are a horrifying amount of them) wouldn't be something that goes against American values. 

&gt;The US will have more police homicides by firearm than Australia, but the folks living in Hillsboro, OR would be kind of cranky with you if you said that Gary's homicides were evidence that all of America (including Hillsboro) was a terrifying place to be. After all, the homicides are happening 2100 miles away.

Except this fantasy rendition isn't the case. There are police homicides happening all across America, and at a horrifying rate. That demonstrates a systematic issue, and one that can't just be swept under the rug in as a ""only a few bad apples"" argument. Even if it is just ""a few"", that few needs to be sorted out, as it is a problem on a horrifying scale.

"dkb63cg","I think I'm a fairly average looking woman naturally, but with the effort I put in, I can usually be above average. I'm good at makeup, I enjoy fashion, I keep fit, and I never leave the house without my hair done. And I 100% notice a difference in how others treat me, depending on my appearance.


When I don't look that nice -- when I'm sick, or it's a bad hair day, or I'm not wearing makeup -- I find that most other women are cordial and pleasant to me, but nothing extra. There are no special favours done, but I'm also not treated especially poorly. This is probably because I look solidly average without my added frills. Young women aren't particularly interested in being my friend when I look ""meh""; they aren't as receptive to conversations, they don't approach me, they don't invite me places. But they aren't mean or anything. Just not interested. Old women tend to treat me *more nicely* when I look bad.



Now, when I look nice, it's different. I find, when it comes to reception of young female attractiveness, people can be generally divided into two groups:


**Group 1: Children, the elderly, young men, middle-aged men, &amp; young women.**


**Group 2: Middle-aged women.**


When I look nice and put together, group 1 is more pleasant  to me than they otherwise might be. Children &amp; their young moms smile at me, young men hold doors, old men in the elevator make conversation, female sales assistants and coworkers are more attentive and friendly. 


But when I look nice, group 2 treats me like *absolute dog shit* compared to how they treat me on a bad hair day! Anywhere from ages 45-65, I find the trouble exists; many of these women are not very pleasant to put-together young ladies. The only people I've ever gotten nasty unsolicited comments on my appearance from... middle aged women. The only customers who routinely refuse to treat me with dignity at work... middle aged women. The people who critique everything about me the most... middle aged women.


No idea why. Saying it's jealousy is stupid, because lots of these middle-aged women are absolutely beautiful, much more beautiful than I am. And in my experience, the prettier, more put-together middle-aged women are the meaner ones; the mom-looking ones are usually really nice.",1500246226,"children &amp; their young moms smile at me, young men hold doors, old men in the elevator make conversation, female sales assistants and coworkers are more attentive and friendly.","attentive and friendly","friendly",NA,FALSE,"more attentive and friendly","attentive",NA,"more",0

I left it at No Reply. Then a few days later I was commenting regarding travel insurance on the fb group and this time she asked ""R0sesRedVi0letsBlue where are you flying from?""

I'm happy with where this is at, and also putting the comments of 'looking forward to solitude' etc at times during the trip to set the tone.

"dk9090o","I went last year for the first time, mostly as a substitute for Tomorrowworld being cancelled.  As far as the PLUR vibes, Imagine won't be in the top ten.  I would suspect that EF is comparable to to Tomorrowworld which was a constant flow of contagious positive vibes and energy.  Not that Imagine consist of a different crowd, I think it has to do more with the layout and setup of the festival grounds.  People were very nice and had no issues but you won't see the constant high fives, nor will too many people be going out of their way to make you feel anything extra.  At least that was my experience and what I observed, I even noticed at the time how different the vibes were compared to Tomorrowworld.  

Although on my opinion TW was a one of a kind festival.  You couldn't escape the positive energy if you tried.  Hoping the rumor of a TW return in 2018.  

Another thing about ""Imagine"" is that it's not nearly as international as other EDM festivals are, such EDC and Ultra, TW was also a global event.  You won't see the diversity of people as much as the major festivals, Imagine is still in it's infant stage.  I think it's mostly a Southeastern US festival.  Of course a handful of people do travel from cross country which is a good thing.  I noticed while entering the festival and seeing all the license plates around the campground that most are Georgia, Alabama, and Florida.  

With all that said it's still a really cool festival and people are nice and friendly, but the acquaintances I made were only from my immediate camp neighbors. Which we were really lucky to have such cool people surrounding our campsite. To me that's extremely important and chances are you'll have cool neighbors also, this will be my 4th camping EDM festival and I have never had any issues with the people camping nearby.  

The Imagine festival has never been about having a major mainstream lineup like the others but you will have a lineup of talent and different genres of EDM.  Of course there will be big names that everyone knows like Tiesto, A&amp;B and Deadmau5 but for the most part it consists of lesser known DJs but still awesome music.  This fact also creates smaller crowds at the other stages apart from the Mainstage.  

I could definitely share plenty of information that is unique to ""Imagine"" but I think I've already answered much more than you were originally asking.  

Let me know if you do want the full review from last year.  These festivals have become a huge part of my life and I think this phenomenon has lasted much longer than anyone expected it too.

Take Off Pounds Sensibly (TOPS) is a nonprofit, peer-led, organization of local clubs in the USA and Canada.  We meet weekly in libraries, fire stations, community centers and discuss and educate and support one another on weight loss and long-term management.    There are weigh-ins and group and individual contests -- we try to make it a fun mix of social-interactive and hard-weight-loss facts because we're going to be together for a long time and it has to stay fun and friendly but it also has to get ""Job #1"" done -- weight loss.

http://www.tops.org/

&gt; We are ""starting"" tomorrow with a weekly check in. Basically, weigh in to get a baseline of where we all stand, discuss our goals and motivations, I'm going to work on reading about an interesting health topic each week so we can discuss it, and I'm thinking a weekly ""focus"" would be a good idea. This week it will be just to log everything we eat. Everyone already downloaded MFP and has gotten familiar with it. The ""focus"" will serve as a mini goal really so you can feel accomplished each week even if the scale gods aren't being kind. I'd also like to get us to focus on what we accomplish not just the numbers.

"djr1hz1","&gt; (plus some of it's own to provide some additional basic things, which you don't have use if you don't want.)

Not true. Most of the DE packages that are going to be installed by default are in the Antergos repo, as well as a much larger selection of other packages (http://build.antergos.com/repo/browse/main), such as browsers and other things are installed from there. If one were to try to disable the Antergos repo in order to get these packages from the Arch repos and AUR, it would take caution and some wrestling, and is probably more involved than the average Antergos user is up for.

&gt; To that end, Manjaro is not as much an Arch installer per se as much as it's own Arch-based flavor.

This is true. Antergos goes much further than any other Arch respin in idiosyncratic installation decisions (see lightdm for every DE) and config files. And that's why I can't recommend it. Either opt for an Arch-like experience with the user-friendly, but distinct, Manjaro or, if you're going to install Arch with a respin, use one (like Archlabs, OB Revenge) that is less ambitious, hews closer to plain Arch and leaves you with an installation that is basically, or easily convertible to, a plain Arch system that you can maintain as Arch long term.

Antergos users should know that they are venturing into an in-between type of situation, not Manjaro and not Arch, that is going to leave them mostly dependent of Antergos and it's own community for support. If Antergos has legs, then this isn't so dire, but, at least for me, Antergos hasn't proved itself to the degree that I'd be willing to put my eggs in that basket.

"djih1vt","New England:

Good parts:

* Friendly and direct people
* Privacy is an actual thing here, people give you space here and it's overall pretty non-judgemental
* Actual seasons, and I consider this to be very nice. Most of the country measures seasons just by temperature, but here you have lush and humid summers, brilliant red leaves and crisp breezes in autumn, snow filled wonderlands in the winter, and cool rainy springs. Words really don't do it justice, [so] (https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/cd/48/5d/cd485da940b168050d81ccd30d58970b.jpg) |  [see](https://images.fineartamerica.com/images-medium-large-5/essence-of-new-england-new-hampshire-autumn-classic-thomas-schoeller.jpg) | [for](http://cdn3.craftsy.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/winter_view_from_kearsarge_north_0422-Edit.jpg) | [yourself](https://www.photoshelter.com/img-get/I0000cyvQiV0aDyQ/s/575/383/NH155105.jpg). I know everyone likes the region they live in, and I've lived in many other places with their own charm, but I don't think any place comes close to the beauty of New England.
* It's a very healthy, safe, and prosperous region
* Although we're extremely white (New Hampshire has only 3% of people of other ethnicity) and fairly limited in terms of multicultural foods or whatever, nobody cares about your race or sexual preferences, which is a big change from some other parts of the country. This also goes for religious beliefs, by the way.
* It has the perfect mix of a busy Boston and other cities to keep life interesting and the quiet and peace of the rural parts in Vermont and northern New Hampshire.
* It's small (distance wise). You can get from NH to Boston in an hour if traffic is good, and from there to Providence in another. You can easily visit family in another state or see something new without having to make it a 3 day marathon.
* It's a very liberal and communal climate, if that's your thing. Even conservatives can live here easily, although as mentioned above hyper religiousness or race based attacks aren't very well accepted.
* Lots of interesting history.
* Nice infrastructure. We have excellent libraries, lots of lovely museums, beautiful parks, the nation's best schools, and great international connections. If you can live with the roads sometimes being in bad shape, it's excellent and keeps life interesting.
* To go with that, education is very high. New England is the most educated section of America, schools and colleges are generally very good, and academic credentials are highly valued; this might be the only part of the country where a minimum wage professor is more highly valued than a millionaire businessman. As such, if you work in an academic field or like learning in general, you have lots of opportunities to do so here.

Bad parts:

* It's expensive. All of those lovely public amenities cost taxes, and the land is highly valued; this makes the parts that are close to cities quite pricey, and honestly, for how much you pay, some parts are rather a let down (Boston in particular is quite dirty). Although jobs do pay better here to help compensate, if you own a 6 bedroom house with 10 acres of land in Tennessee, you are going to have to be prepared to downsize a bit.
* Rather single cultural. We definitely have international places in Boston, but we have nothing like California's or New York's mix of cultures. If you like the colorful and variety these places have, New England outside of Boston might not be for you.
* The weather. Ya, it's incredibly beautiful, but when you want to drive to work and are waiting for your car to heat up, it might not feel quite so appealing. Likewise, if you like the warmth and dryness of Nevada for example, you are probably going to hate slush filled winters at 13 degrees (before wind).
* The traffic can be pretty bad on some of the interstates during rushhour.
* It's much more communal. This depends on your personality, but New England places a stronger importance on the wellbeing of society over the individual, which means that as fun as riding an ATV in the forest may sound, you are not going to be able to do it because of the damage it causes to the environment. If you value the idea of doing whatever you want even if it inconveniences others or damages public property, New England is not the region for you.
* It can be a bit introverted or closed. People are friendly, but they aren't going to wave to you on the street, want to know all about your third removed Aunt Sally, or want to hold hours of small talk on your front porch. Getting integrated and making friends can take a little bit of time.
* Although anyone is welcome to move here, it can take awhile before you become accepted as a New Englander. Becoming a local within a year of moving here is definitely not a thing.
* It has a very direct culture, and I've noticed this is particularly a thing that southerners sometimes either aren't prepared for or don't deal well with. If you are sensitive to criticism or don't take well to people disagreeing with you, that is definitely something you need to prepare to deal with. People definitely aren't passive aggressive, and nobody is going to nod there head in agreement and voice their disagreements with you in private later or give you compliments  and praise if they don't think you deserve it.",1498662904,"new england:  good parts:  * friendly and direct people * privacy is an actual thing here, people give you space here and it's overall pretty non-judgemental * actual seasons, and i consider this to be very nice.","friendly and direct","friendly",NA,FALSE,"friendly and direct","direct",NA,NA,1
"dja81y5","I completely sympathize. It's enough to make me very angry at the world sometimes. I live in a European border town.  Normally Europe is safe as hell but since the borders aren't well controlled and there's a lot of transient people trying to capitalize on that.  A female jogger was just raped and murdered here in the fall, she was jogging on a pretty well-travelled Sunday jogging route. There was even lots of people around but nobody saw anything.  Last week one was grabbed but she got away. That was in a well populated city park! 

I've been able to jog near my house, but only 5 km which i have to do in three circles. It is so unbelievably boring, three circles in an open field in town across from the grocery store so I have good visibility and can be seen by the entire town. But even with that:  part of it has corn, and the corn is getting higher. A group of 40 men from another country was placed near there while they wait for their asylum process, and last week two of them followed me on their bikes as I jogged. They were being friendly, but it was so unnerving. I cut the jog short and went home after 2 km rather than continue through the part that has low visibility. (Since I'm being a sad sack, I also resent that a healthy fear for my safety has made me slightly xenophobic towards people who come here and are in transit, from countries that are basically lawless, and has overturned my affinity to be friendly and open. I am pro-refugee, pro multiculturalism, but still am afraid). 

I've been getting through it. There's no jogging groups near me and I don't enjoy jogging in groups anyways, I would love a long jog in a forest the way the dudes can; to clear my head and just enjoy nature.  

I know people mean well when they try to give options but to me nothing can make it feel like it's NOT a kind of prison to not be able to do what another gender can do and to have to bend over backwards just to jog five fucking km. I was reading training plans for marathons and ultras and it kind of made me mad, how can I find the safety to jog 32 km ANYWHERE ?? That would be 32 time around my ""loop"", and even my loop doesn't always feel safe.  3 hours on a jog and it's 3 hours longer in my day that I'm exposed to whatever is out there attacking women joggers.   What I've been doing lately is going with my husband through my beloved forest, but he's not home during the week, so it's only on weekends.  And I resent even that I need a ""protector"". 

It really does suck. I'm sorry you are feeling the same.  All we can do is accept reality and find ways to work with it, but I totally understand the underlying resentfulness, even on our best days where we suck it up and work around it.

But he would also make jokes with other kids who were not in need of care and they wouldn't either.

He asked his mom when ""this whole Down syndrome thing was going to be over."" And she felt terrible because he couldn't really fit in with even people that were like him.

Like I said, there's nothing as serious as Down syndrome or any other conditions that affect me thank god. But I understood exactly how he felt. I feel like that little boy every day.

"diiuwu1","A mutual friend set me up with a woman, named Annie. We talked on the phone and had a couple of nice conversations. We set up a date for a Saturday night. Basically, dinner and drinks. Place picked out - I made reservations. Annie asked that I picked her up and rung her apartment buzzer when I arrived. So I did that on this Saturday night (maybe about 10 years ago) and she said for me to come up. I was kind of surprised because I didn't arrive that much sooner than our dinner reservations.

This was before facebook and neither of us had seen a picture of the other. I walked up, Annie opened the door and I was pleased to see a very cute short girl with blonde hair. She had big tits on a fairly thin frame. In other words, I was excited to hopefully get a chance to hook up with her. Annie was very welcoming and asked me to sit on her couch. I did. She sat down next to me and I was surprised by how close she was on this our first (blind) date. The conversation was limited to 'it's so nice to put a face with the guy I've had such good conversations with,' and then she leaned over and started kissing me. I was floored, but I already decided I wanted to hook up with Annie - who was I to complain if it was sooner vs. later. She took off her top and shoved my face against her huge bare breasts. I naturally started licking and sucking them. 

Then she asked, ""Do you eat pussy?"" Well, anyone who knows me knows that that's like asking a fish if it breathes under water. I said, ""Absolutely."" Annie took off her jeans to reveal no panties underneath and a full blonde bush. I went to town, she flipped into 69 position, ripped off my pants and underwear and started blowing me. I managed to hold back long enough to give her what seemed like two orgasms, then, in recognizing the humor of this whole situation, said, ""I don't want you to have to swallow my cum on an empty stomach."" She giggled with my cock still in her mouth but showed no signs of stopping. As promised, I blew my load. She kept her mouth sealed around my pulsating cock for every spurt and then spit the contents of my drained balls into an empty Solo cup that I hadn't noticed on the side table until now.

I even looked inside the cup to see how much of it was filled and remarked, ""Oh my G-d, that was an amazing blowjob; I jerked off before I came here and you still got all that out."" She said, ""Well, you better not be all used up, because I want to fuck you after dinner.""

And would you believe we went to the same restaurant - albeit late - at which I made a reservation. Annie's theory, as she explained it to me, was that if she's attracted to a guy she wants to do some heavy petting early on so she can get the awkwardness out of the 'first date.' If the petting (i.e., 69-ing) is good, she goes through with the date and fucks the guy late-night. If it's no good, she just afterglows for a while and the guy isn't the least bit surprised when she doesn't ask to go to dinner. He just ends up leaving and if he calls for anther date, she doesn't return the call. If she's not even attracted to the guy, she goes out for dinner, remains civil and friendly, but no hook up at all ensues.  So needless to say I was highly flattered that she was attracted to me at first sight to hook up right away, and wiling to fuck me later.

She was right, it was one of the least awkward, carefree dinner dates I ever had. We weren't afraid to talk about what we had just done (for example, I told her how much I loved that she had a full bush and that her blond hair was a beautiful shade of pubic hair), but we also talked about ordinary, non-sexual topics with little regard for what the other thought. We already knew we were attracted to one another.

Sure enough, we went back to her apartment after dinner, having had a chance to produce some more semen and get hard again - and if we didn't fuck the night away! I know I shouldn't have done it in light of her 'system' and how many other guys she's probably fucked, but I couldn't resist the opportunity to fuck her barebone after knowing how tight but creamy her pussy gets from having eaten her out earlier. She asked, ""Do you want to put on a condom?"" I said, ""If that's not rhetorical, honestly, I really, really don't want to wear a condom with you."" She took a long stare at my erect penis and said, ""Fuck, the tip of your cock is too big to cover it up with a condom; that tip alone is gonna make me cum. Put it in my hairy pussy you love so much."" She rolled her knees back by her ears and I literally saw her labia minora unfurl, inviting me in. I inserted just the tip of my cock (to which she so lovingly referred) in her opening, and after a couple of ""mmmm's,"" and ""ohhhhhs"" out of both of us, plunged it deep into her nether regions. We fucked for a good half hour and after ""[my] fucking tip"" as she called it gave her 3 orgasms I unloaded my second load of the night on her torso and huge breasts. We rested for about an hour and with her bedroom smelling distinctly like her musky pussy mixed with my semen, we proceeded to go again.

**What is a Witcher?**  
  
 When monsters began to threaten human towns, people needed a solution. Mages provided that solution by taking orphans and pumping them full of drugs, killing the vast majority of them and just generally having a damned good time. As a marketable bi-product, those handful of human, male orphans that survived the various drugs and magical potions that got pumped straight into their tear ducts became faster, stronger, tougher with super human senses and a body that can take a licking and keep on kicking... Enter: The Witcher!  
  
 Trained in combat and magic with the intent to kill Dragons and keep human towns safe from regularly BBQing, they were very effective... To the point where they ran themselves out of business. Now they wander around the world, taking jobs anywhere they find them. Some became assassins and soldiers of fortune for want of work. Some time ago the last mage who knew the rituals and chemicals and the last copy of their notes went up in flames and, since then, no more Witchers have been made... At least, not in The School Of The Wolf, where our game is set.   
  
 Witchers are sterile, but still able to tenderize a slab of lady meat with repeated hammerings in the bedroom. They are strong and fast and can see, hear and smell with supernatural strength, but usually look, sound and taste like shit because they spend their whole lives on the road. Like most non-humans, Witchers are seen as suspicious and wicked... And that isn't wrong, because let's remember they are trained super killers, born only to murder and steal children to turn INTO future murderers... Assuming they survive being filled with literal poison. Suffice to say, your average Witcher has a poor reputation as soon as he walks into town. Then he saves your wife and child, slays the monster and is a hero... Right up until he asks for the coin you promised him, then he's a monster again! GET OUT OF HERE, FREAK!  
  
 **Plot Summary Of The First Two Games.**  
  
 Geralt, the deadest Witcher there ever was, suddenly rocks up back home one day without a memory. Roughly the same time as his arrival, the Wild Hunt starts being seen racing across the skies and troubling villages and towns. I'm sure these things aren't related, however. Nothing to see here, move along!   
  
 As Geralt is recovering, an apparent gang of bandits take the chance to storm the Witcher school, looking for the forumlae and mutagens used to make Witchers. They kill some of the remaining Witchers and get away with what they wanted, leaving the living Witchers, Gealt included, to split up and search for them... Even if they don't plan on making any more Witchers, those secrets must not fall into the wrong hands.  
  
 Geralt tracks the band down and confronts them only to find that they were secretly in the employee of a person who is a member of a powerful bloodline, much like his adopted daughter Ciri. Geralt screws an ever increasing number of woman and collects the trading cars they, apparently, give out to every lover, trying to make the whole set before finally confronting the man who explains that he is trying to save the world from the coming of an ice age... An ice age that Geralt had originally thought was connected to his daughter Ciri. This man is trying to breed super mutant people who can survive this endless winter and rebuild human society using the Witcher mutations, but the Wild Hunt is chasing him down, seeking to drag him away for some reason?... What could they want with him??  
  
 Geralt resolves these troubling events by pulling his pants up, tucking his cock away for 30 seconds and killing everyone an everything. Remember, kids: If violence isn't the answer, you aren't apply enough of it!  
  
 Geralt returns for his reward only to find the King under attack... By a Witcher no less! He foils the assassination attempt, but then other kings start showing up dead... One of whom is killed while Geralt is alone with him! Accused of regicide, Geralt escapes the dungeons and seeks to clear his name, however it is made harder because ""Witchers"" keep killing kings for some damned reason!  
  
 As it turns out, this is a mutual plot by the emperor of the south and the lodge of sorceresses who are seeking to kill kings, sow chaos and prepare the north for invasion. While everyone is busy fighting over who belongs on the throne next and concerning themselves with Elven revolutionaries, the south prepares its armies and starts taking land.  
  
 Geralt finds and confronts the Witcher who was hired to kill the kings. His name is Letho and he's from the School Of The Viper. He was promised by the emperor that they would rebuild his school and fund it if he murdered the kings... With no place to call home, no brothers from his school left and everyone, everywhere hating him just because he was a Witcher, Letho's theory went something like this:  
  
 ""Fuck da police!""  
  
 Geralt confronts him and, depending on what your choices are, brutally savages him or lets him go.  
  
 The third game finds you in the political aftermath. The south invades and is taking ground every day. Radovid, one of the Northern rulers, betrays his allies and takes them, presenting the south with a unified north under his rulership... He promises to return the old borders and also that he and his men are very close to perfecting the flying pig.  
  
 **Important Characters**  
  
 **Geralt** A living penis, Geralt has boned his way through 2 other games and gotten better looking each time.  
  
 **Ciri** The natural daughter of the Emperor, but Geralt and Yennefer's adopted daughter. She's got a line of elven blood in her that grants her great power, but she doesn't know how to control it, like giving a toddler a monster truck.  
  
 **Yennefer** Yennefer is Geralt's lover. She treats him like dirt, is cold and distant, cheats on him regularly and Geralt wouldn't have it any other way. Their relationship is on again/off again constantly with huge bouts of time where they are apart, then short, sweet moments together before they get on each others nerves again and part once more. Geralt made a wish to a magical being that he and Yennefer would be tied together forever... Instead of the ultimate bondage he hoped for, their fates were bound. Whoopse!  
  
 **Triss** Triss date raped Geralt once, then, when he lost his memory, she didn't exactly race to correct him about the nature of their relationship in the same way parents don't race to correct kids about Santa Clause and the Tooth Fairy. She loves Geralt and Ciri, but her hair colour in the games prove she has no soul, so what are you gonna do, right?  
  
 **Emhyr var Emreis** The emperor of Niflg... Nilfgg... Neelfg.... The South! The Fucking South! He and Geralt ran into each other in the past and Geralt adopted his stray daughter, Ciri.  
  
 **Shani** The Red Headed Step Doctor. Another friend you might run into, she and Geralt worked on helping people suffering from the Catriona plague.  
  
 **Dandelion** It would be rude to call Dandelion a lair, a whore and a scoundrel, and my mother told me if you don't have anything nice to say, don't say anything at all... So I don't have anything much to say about him. He's Geralt's friend and, generally, means well.  
  
 **Zoltan** Zoltan is a dwarf who has been a long time friend. He's stalwart, noble, honest and has a beard that looks like you could hide a small family of hedgehogs in it... Which would be fucking adorable, so why isn't anyone doing it?!  
  
 **Gaunter O'Dim** Sells mirrors.  
  
 **Regis** Let's be honest here... Regis is a Vampire, but he's caught a little bit of Twilight fever and sworn off blood. Now, I know what you're thinking: ""Who cares about this prancing nancy boy poofter!? I want my vampires to be vampires, damnit!""... It's okay though, because he's actually pretty cool! Unlike Twilight vampires he makes you interested and I don't want to punch him in the throat every time I see him.  
  
 **Vesemir** If The School Of The Wolf had a kindly but grumpy old grandfather who could also cut your fucking throat with a flick of his wrist because he was in ""The War"" and, despite the fact he seems jolly, you don't really want to make him angry, that would be Vesemir. He's friendly, but stern and teaches sword play and magic at the school.  
  
 **Lambet** What a prick...  
  
 **Eskel** A fellow Wolf School Witcher with a hair-lip scar and surrounded by rumours of beastiality thanks to his closeness to Little Bleeter.  
  
 **Roach** See Roche.  
  
 **Roche** See Roach... Okay, not really. Roach is the name Geralt gives to all his horses while Roche is the name of the leader of the special forces in Temeria. You can only ride one of them, so pick well.  
  
 **Thaler** A professional spy who teaches Trolls the correct way to call you a cunt while you are fighting them...

"dhtky31","I go to one store most often, but living in Columbus, OH there's a Sbux every couple blocks so I hit up a bunch pretty regularly. I do DT a decent amount, and MOP at times, so although a few at my store have recognized me, I'm not regular enough to know anyone by name.

In cold months, my drink is usually a half-sweet toffee nut latte. I don't order it that way, I order a 3-pump venti or a 2-pump grande to avoid the ""can't do a half-sweet for venti since it's 5 pumps"" conversation that I had a number of times. Sometimes just brewed coffee (not Pike) with milk and  couple pumps of some syrup. During holiday season I also got the smoked butterscotch latte quite a bit. When I don't want coffee I go for caramel apple spice.

Warm months, I'm either iced coffee or cold brew. Usually with milk and toffee nut, but I also do VSCCB or toasted coconut cold brew at times. When I don't want coffee I go for various iced teas or refreshers, usually unmodified. 

My baristas don't really know me personally, but I've never had a bad experience with a barista, partially because I've worked in customer service all my life (pharmacy) and I know not to treat people like crap. I tip, because I know they go through crap! I'm friendly but brief when they're busy, but I've hung out and chatted when they're slow.

The main highway south is mostly dirt and very, very, very dusty.  Dust is probably more of an issue than rain.

Most of the water is drinkable but I did bring back some funk that resulted in a brain and spine MRI to rule out MS.  (I'm fine).  I would suggest filtering the water.

Gauchos are friendly but very rustic.  Getting a local to introduce you is a good idea.  If you get permission, some gaucho ranches are enormous and you could spend weeks fishing just one of them.

I would bring an inflatable tube float.  The lake fishing is amazing but the banks can be too shear/overgrown for easy access.

Bees.  There are a lot of them and they are reportedly Africanized.  They prefer raw meats to sugars (supposedly proof of their Africanized nature).

Pumas.  They are numerous.  Watch where you camp.

Rabbits.  Super-abundant.  Go in season and borrow or short-term buy a .22 and you will have more delicious meat than you can eat.

Quail. Also super-abundant.  I would do everything I could to bring a shotgun, and again dinner will be yours for the taking.  A 20 gauge might double for rabbits if you bring a turkey choke and are sneaky.

"dgv6ltg","Size does matter, but a Newfie could be a great first dog. The things I'd be thinking about when it comes to size are

* **Training matters so much more.** Yes people need to train their lapdogs, but a chihuahua who jumps or snarls at strangers is a minor nuisance, whereas a Newfie like that is a huge liability. Just thinking about some of the ""naughty"" stuff my dog does--trying to chase rabbits, whining and pulling incessantly if she sees a cat, sometimes forgetting to heel and foraging ahead--if she weighed &gt;100 lbs rather than 40 lbs, I'd probably be along for the ride if she wanted to go meet the neighbor's kitty. 

* **Socialization is triply important.** This is the same idea as the above, adding in that some people are scared of most dogs and will be terrified of a giant black Newfie. You want your dog to act like a big fluffy teddy bear, and that means having a dog who's very relaxed around strangers, kids, men in funny hats, wheelchairs and canes, strollers, etc. If you get a Newfie puppy you're going to want to put a *lot* of time into socializing him while he's small enough that the general reaction is ""oooooooh how cute!!"" Newfies tend to be friendly, but there are exceptions to every breed description, and the best way to stack the deck in your favor is to give your dog lots and lots of early positive experiences with all kinds of people. 

* **You need to be physically capable--or accept that there will be times you can't help your dog.** I love Newfies but will probably never have one, because I'm not strong enough to move one downstairs and into the car in an emergency. I couldn't carry one home if he got hit by a car on a walk. And, as mentioned before, if he startled or spooked and pulled on the leash, I might not be able to control him. Some people have giant breeds in spite of this, but for me, it's a reason to avoid them. 

All of that said, Newfies are a great breed, and in many ways they're perfect for the first-time owner--mellow, friendly, and happy with fairly little exercise. It sounds like you already know the importance of finding a good breeder, but I would add that you also want to find a very good trainer, and get your pup enrolled in a puppy class as soon as allowed. Newfies grow so fast that it's something of a race against time to get them obedient and socialized before they're full-grown, so you want to be prepared to hit the ground running.

"dfnodow","I'm a woman and have met around 20 guys through online dating. It's not possible for me to know if I will ""feel it"" until meeting someone in person, though my level of enthusiasm for meeting the person can vary based on how well we've clicked through messaging. And there does seem to be a strong though imperfect correlation between good messaging and in person chemistry for me. 

Anyway, of those 20 men, I ""felt it"" with 6 of them. All of the others would have assumed the date was going well until they asked me to extend the date to another activity or asked me out for a second date, at which point I would (in most cases) drop the lack of chemistry bomb or (in rare cases) take them up on their offer of a second date to be sure (these were cases in which I was on the fence and my initial instincts of not enough chemistry turned out to be correct). 

While I'm still friendly throughout the date when I'm not feeling it, I would say my level of excitement and enthusiasm is noticeably higher when I *am* feeling it. In those cases, I can be really flirty rather than just friendly. But I think all of these guys would have assumed the date was going well to at least some degree. I'm not intentionally misleading them, but rather being polite and friendly and trying to enjoy the date for what it is, just two strangers chatting. I haven't had any bad dates that have made me feel a need to abruptly end them or climb out a bathroom window or whatever. I just enjoy the chat and communicate my intentions if/when the other person moves to push things forward.

"dfnmjyy","There's a few that I'm familiar with... the first two are from western NY (where I grew up) and the third is from a bit north of Boston (where I currently live).

1. Festival Guy. Super old, long haired hippie dude, supposedly friendly but still weird. He wears the shortest cut off denim shorts I've ever seen (on a man OR woman) and shows up to every single festival or public concert and dances the whole time, right up front.

2. Waving Guy (not his actual title). This is 60-70 year old dude who walks up and down a long stretch of road (I think for exercise) and waves to LITERALLY EVERYONE. In high school, it was so exciting to drive past this guy and everyone in the car would wave and cheer.

3. Kilt Dude. Now this is probably a normal dude who plays D&amp;D and I have no beef with, so don't think I'm mocking him in anyway. We cool. We always see him around downtown and no matter the weather or occasion, he's wearing a kilt. Always. And in this little city, that's not a common thing.

Maybe the UNSC could send Spartan IIIs in when the flood have been released to support the Chief, or some other bullshit excuse for us to break canon and have Spartan allies.  I'd accept any reason.

2. Or if adding Spartans is too out there, how about giving a special class of ODSTs energy shields.  I guess that would be the only way to have human allies that can stand up to the flood.

"dfez5nx","It kind of really saddens me to see this.  Looking back I have quite a lot of internet friends that I have lost complete contact with.  Most of my online friends were from the MSN height era. 

A few years ago I accidentally stumbled onto the knowledge that one of my former friends that I spent years talking to in his MSN Chatroom and messenger passed away.    He was a pastor and I was a atheist and despite these differences we would have friendly but long debates.   As well as just talking about everything else that came to mind.    I wonder how his wife is?  Is his bookstore in Texas still open?  Why did I even stop talking to him to begin with?  Or any of them?

So many people that I knew for years.   Just gone, and I wonder if they still think of me those that are still among us.  I have no idea how to get in contact with any of them anymore.  I tried to login to my MSN email address which I haven't used since Gmail was in beta and I got a invite.  But it seems to have been disabled along with any way to contact my old friends just to see if they are well.

I guess I should just be thankful for the good moments I shared with them.  It's just strange as back then I had many online friends and today I really have none.   Sure I have in person friends but the internet is a lonely place for me now.

"df6ctvd","DH's best friend, (or as I call him, my sisterwife 😂), just went through this with a girl. He met her through a mutual friend at the gym, he was friendly but never interested. Said mutual friend gave SW's number to crazy chick, didn't even ask if it was OK first. 

Right out the gate, this girl starts texting him lewd shit. She said he looks like he'd be a really good lover, she wants him to fuck her in the ass, wants to sit on his face, says she's thinking of him and getting herself off. When DH told me, he was like ""haha listen to this funny story..."". I'm like....no, it's actually not funny at all, it's sexual harassment. He told this chick that he wasn't interested and she continued. If it were the other way around, he'd be fucking arrested.

He started ignoring her messages, but I told him to send one more explicitly saying NO to her. If she still wouldn't back off, I intended to take matters into my own hands. The best way to deal with a crazy bitch is to top her crazy and if you fuck with my family, you will see what happens when you cross a Captain Crazy Bitch.

 Luckily for her, he put an end to the situation himself. It makes me so angry because he is a gentleman to a fault, so he felt like it would be wrong for him to be angry and rude towards her when she wouldn't take the hint. The fact that he felt as though he wasn't allowed to defend himself against a predator simply because she's a woman is fucking awful. 

He told me last night that it was kind of an eye opening experience for him, as far as truly understanding what women go through way too much.",1490025735,"he met her through a mutual friend at the gym, he was friendly but never interested.","friendly but never","friendly","but",FALSE,"friendly but never interested","interested",NA,"never",1
"df649f2","The two best U.S. based cube shops are the Cubicle and Speed Cube Shop. The Cubicle has been having problems with consistency in their shipping and processing speeds lately, but they, far and away, have the largest and most diverse puzzle selection. They also offer many different types of lubes, stickers, premium/custom puzzles, and other accessories and merchandise. If I need to make a special order, like a magnetic, custom-setup cube, a replacement part, a unique cubing T-shirt, or some obscure and hard to find puzzle, I go to the Cubicle. On the other hand, if I just want to pick up a couple standard speedcubes, Speed Cube Shop is the place to be. They have very slightly lower prices, but phenomenal shipping time and near instantaneous processing time. 

That's my two cents on shops to buy from, but I'd also like to touch on the recommendations made by /u/Ninja5199. ShengShou puzzles have really improved, but they're nowhere near as good as the top brands like, MoYu, QiYi, YuXin, and Gans. He recommended some very old and generally awful puzzles. I agree with the idea of getting a 4x4 and Megaminx, possibly a 5x5 too, but you should really consider getting your son better turning puzzles. They make solving so much more fun and enjoyable and he'll be more motivated to try to improve and become faster. For the best possible puzzles, I'd recommend the QiYi WuQue 4x4, the QiYi QuShuang 5x5, and the X-Man Design Galaxy Megaminx. For more budget-friendly but still decent options, I'd recommend the KungFu CangFeng 4x4, and the MoFangJiaoShi MF5S 5x5. 

You could also consider a Skewb and a better Pyraminx (as I'm guessing he has a ShengShou or something of the sort), or maybe a better 3x3 or 2x2. For Pyraminx and Skewb, I'd recommend the MoYu Magnetic Pyraminx and the MoYu Magnetic Skewb. Some of the best 3x3's available today are the MoYu WeiLong GTS, the QiYi Valk 3, and the Gans 356 Air. All of these cubes are available in magnetic variants on the Cubicle-- that is if you're willing to order from them knowing it may take a while. Magnetic 3x3's are very expensive (~$50) but have very good performance and would last your son an extremely long time. The WeiLong GTS v2 is also coming out soon and it looks like it will be the new best cube, so that may be worth waiting for. As for 2x2, the best is easily the GuoGuan XingHen, and it's also available in a magnetic version on the Cubicle. 

Sorry for the massive information dump, but hopefully some of this was helpful in some way!

EDIT: As for apps and software, there are some pretty useful resources. For iOS, ChaoTimer appears to be the best, and for Android, I can't recommend TwistyTimer enough. It is very useful for keeping track of solves and data associated with them. It also has a reference section for OLL and PLL algorithms. For a desktop/laptop timer, csTimer is an web-based program that is very good and has lots of useful features and customization. Another useful website is algdb.net. It has tons of algorithms for reference that will become more and more important as your son progresses.",1490014608,"for more budget-friendly but still decent options, i'd recommend the kungfu cangfeng 4x4, and the mofangjiaoshi mf5s 5x5.","friendly but still","friendly","but",FALSE,"friendly but still decent","decent",NA,"still",1

"dep4ekc","1. Quality of life - Depends on where you live. You will make more money than local teachers, so spending/saving isn't a problem if you're not an idiot. If you live in a T1/2 city, you will have plenty to do, great shopping, other foreigners, restaurants, etc. You will also be dealing with pollution, traffic, and of course, people. Travelling is great if you're on a high-speed rail line. 

2. Chines/Laowai friends - Chinese people usually want something from you, usually free English lessons for themselves or their kids. They can be very generous and friendly, but they're looking to score too. You can find genuine friends, it takes a little work though. Foreigners can be great, or they can be really toxic.

3. I work at a high school in a poorer province. I teach 18 classes/week, no co-teacher and I get to teach what I want. Most of the kids are great, but the administration is just clueless and it's frustrating having to deal with them.

4. I know enough Chinese to get by. Other than that, people basically assume you are an illiterate moron, even if you are more fluent. They just kind of stare blankly at foreigners whether your Chinese is great or terrible. There are certainly people though who will be happy to swap lessons with you, especially younger people will help out.

5. I do most of my own cooking, and when eating out try to avoid shady looking places (even though they all basically look shady). I've only had 1 real laduzi episode.

I don't know what else you'd want to hear about. I'm interested in things like tea/Tai Chi/needlework, so I've had plenty of opportunities to make Chinese friends.

"dehg24n","I can help you with this question!
My wife lives in Soc Trang, as do I about half of every year with her, and we spend weekends in HCMC. I'm going back in two weeks time, actually. 
From HCMC, it's about an 8 hour bus ride, and then 45 minute van ride. Honestly, it's not really a place to be a tourist, or even to head to without any kind of a specific plan. Honestly, I felt like I was disturbing this moment in time that had been preserved before I walked in. When I met my wife's parents, they had asked us to come to a big remembrance ceremony gathering. I had asked that they convey a message to be a little bit harder on me, and to let me have a chance at earning everyone's trust.
    It's not that it's closed off, but you're basically going to be something completely different than they are used to. It's not like HCMC or other parts of Vietnam where you go and visit. It's more of an investment into coming back again, and trying to earn a spot in the community over a long period of time. I go to spend time with my wife, but while I'm there, I try to be helpful, and in turn, people help me learn.
     It's very off the beaten path, and I love it, but it's not really somewhere to travel to without a real reason.  ElSahuno is right - they don't speak English there at all. It's kind of a very private area, and everyone I know there is just barely getting by. People are very caring and friendly,  but if you're on your own, it's going to be really hard for you to get by. The people that live there actually communicate using body language and expressions, and there's never any doubt as to what their meaning is. 
Regarding English teaching - there are a few locals (albeit not many) who attend English classes outside of Soc Trang, and then attempt to teach it to others. I've only met one other foreigner while traveling in a van to get there.

"de80ph5","Okay so we used to have a dog when I was like 7-9, I can't remember the exact date. And the dog was so sweet and friendly. But we lived in a rural area that had farms nearby. And he always would run to the farms and roll in cow shit. So eventually we put in an electric fence and that didn't stop him. 
He also would use the bathroom in the house. So my mom took him back to the dog pound where we got him. Someone adopted him and they lived near the pound, about 13 miles from my house. One day this fucking dog shows up at our door, about a month after we took him back. He fucking came all the way back. My grandma said it was meant to be but my mom took him back again. 

Oh and one time my neighbor had relatives over. We had a creek in our back yard. Some strange man was out there acting funny and trying to fish out of the creek. My mom told my dad and he stood on the back deck yelling at the guy like wtf are you doing bro. And then later my neighbor said it was her mentally challenged cousin.

"ddjkht0","Oh boy, can I.

There's a lot of good resources to learn about Linux and Open Source software online, so I'll keep it brief.

[Linux](https://www.linux.com/what-is-linux) is an open-source operating system which comes in a number of flavors like [Ubuntu](https://www.ubuntu.com/).  It is an operating system just the same as Mac OS or Windows, with the key difference being that it is non-proprietary.  This means that no one owns it, which has a lot of implications (both good and bad).

Essentially, the code that makes up any given Linux operating system is freely available online.  So if you decide that you want to use Ubuntu, you can literally look at all the code and inner-workings under the hood.  You have all the freedom to do with it as you please, including changing the software however you'd like (although most people don't want to do this nor need to).

Ubuntu, in particular, is generally considered the most user friendly and most popular Linux OS out there (it's what I use on a day to day basis).  It's freely available and maintained by the online community (although it is organized by a central group, so don't worry if you think this may be a security risk or anything).  Ubuntu is free and easy to install.  In fact, you can even install Ubuntu along side Windows if you don't want to give it up.

Now, as a result of a giant corporation such as Microsoft or Apple not pouring billions of dollars into the OS, Linux tends to suffer from a weird learning curve as well as lack of support.  For example, gaming on Linux is tough, even compared to gaming on a Mac.  Another example is trying to install software that isn't distributed in ""easy-to-use"" packages.  None of this should be a deterrent for most users, but it's the downside of such products.

On top of all this, I always recommend pushing for open-source software over propriety.  Coming from a Math major who programs for Data Science a lot, I can't tell you enough how unbelievably vast and active the open source community is.  So, instead of paying a ton of money to use software like Photoshop, you might turn to Gimp.  Or instead of Microsoft Office, you might switch to Libre Office.  Usually the downside is that this kind of software is less developed and less user-friendly, but the upside is that it is always free and available, and your never locked out of the inner-workings of it (try tweeking a piece of the Office Suite).


All in all, try out Ubuntu.  You can download it for free from the site, install it on a flash drive, and try it without having to install anything.  And if you don't rely heavily on software that is only for Windows (or Mac), then I think you'll see that the switch is pretty easy.

**tl;dr** you're forced to use the operating system Microsoft makes the way they want you to, whereas with Linux you and the open-source community choose how it works (which is good for everyone)",1486669444,"ubuntu, in particular, is generally considered the most user friendly and most popular linux os out there (it's what i use on a day to day basis).","friendly and most","friendly",NA,FALSE,"friendly and most popular","popular",NA,"most",1

It's weird living in a city because despite the fact that you're around people basically all day/every day, actual interactions can be kind of tough.

"dcte1u8","I would take the narrative route for myself and my players. This is a character with high presence and lots of talking and cunning abilities, it can definitely be the entrepreneur listed above, or maybe it could be a charmer or scoundrel. You would then work with your GM to maximize your Knowledge Underworld and Streetwise skills to help you solve problems through connections with NPCs.

Example: you need to infiltrate a Hutt's prison to spring an ally who's awaiting execution in the arena. You know a guy who can help.

Make a cunning or Streetwise check to see if you know anyone who can help.

Scenario 1: success with advantage, the ""nice guy""
You know a guy who worked at the prison years back, he's got some old codes that can get you in a maintenence entrance and knows the day-to-day operations, even better, he likes you and will do it for free

Scenario 2: failure with advantage, ""the friendly but unhelpful guy""
Same scenario as above but he hasn't worked at the prison in years and all of his codes are out of date. He can give you a layout and answer questions but you need to get into the prison on your own.

Scenario 3: success with threat, the ""old acquaintance""
You know a guy who was in this prison. You worked on a crew with him back in the day, but he never really liked you and won't help you for free. If you want something, you gotta pay in credits or favors. Maybe he has a buddy on the inside you need to slip a blaster or some brass knuckles to

Scenario 4: Failure with threat, the ""I thought we were friends"" guy
He seems friendly and looks like he wants to help you, but you forgot you owe him money. Now he's turning you over to the local guards to be imprisoned with your ally... unless you talk fast.

Let him know that you have concerns but that you like the guy and want to help him succeed...HOWEVER...if you have to make a difficult decision you want to be sure you have your boss' 100% support. That buddy buddy with the boss garbage is poison and career impacting. Before I ever talked to my boss' boss I'd say: hey boss, I need to talk to boss Sr. Is that cool with you? I was polite and friendly but never more than that. Getting chummy is never ever good. Sorry, always friendly, never a friend.

Okay, the hard part's done....

Part 1: You say...I'm not seeing the commitment that we agreed on when you joined us. 40 hours is the minimum I expect you to be here. Is that your understanding? I know it's your first job but most people will put in between 40-45 hours. Some folks will hit 50 which is what I hit but that's by choice. If you have to go over 50 hours then we need to talk as that's way too many and I need you fresh and ready in case something goes crazy.

Part 2: give him more work. More and more until his quality starts to slide. Then have a conversation about prioritization, balance and work hours. If he's going home at 40 on the dot every week then something isn't right. 41...39...42...38...it should vary if he actually has enough work. Then he should start to say he has enough (generally they'll squawk when you're actually starting to fill their day but not enough to push them out of 40)...when they have to go past 40 they'll start to get fussy. Ideally they'll say something during your 1:1 so you can reprioritize and reassign. Point is as the guy's new you have to push the envelope to see what they're capable of...determine quality of effort...then back down until you're happy. It's like when you're in a new car...you have to really get down on the brakes to see how quickly you can stop. 

Part 3: pay close attention to what this guy's doing. Don't be a micro manager but drop by his desk or walk by a few more times. I would bet you a shiny new dime that he's slacking and slacking hard. Probably really good at his tasks...so good that he can get them done in 1/4 the time as normal...so...back to part 2...he needs more work.

Not when they were released. Apple makes the best monitor you can buy right now, but it's part of an iMac.

Doesn't it have the highest customer sat and reliability of any router? (When it was modern.)

"dckp5fq","&gt;Honestly, Artie has some fucking balls asking Tony to pay his tab. Tony gave him a huge loan, like 50 grand or something like that. And then when the deal fell through and Artie couldn't pay it back, Tony forgave him and told him to just take it off his tab, which was like 6 grand. So unless Tony's bill was 44,000 dollars, Artie should shut the fuck up about it.

Tony Soprano took on the debt note for that scene in Season 4.  (Aired in 2002 but it is supposed to be late 2001 in Soprano time).

He will now make the money, the interest, but it is his mob job to break the french guy's legs if he does not pay off the money (both the original $50k plus any interest).  Tony is going to get that $50k from the french guy.

And he bought this potential $50k plus whatever interest for $6k of debt he owed Artie and Artie forgave.  Aka he bought the debt of the frenchman on discount, just like most debt collectors are not the person who originally had the money loaned to the debtor, but instead people who gave up trying to get the debt and then the note to the phone people whose job is to annoy the person who is behind on paying the debt.

 * In fact this is how much of the mob debt collecting works.  The mob is usually not the loaner money source but instead people like Hesh, and the mob is just merely the enforcement for people like Hesh and together the mob and hesh split the interest, the vig.  Now the mob may also be involved with getting the person interested in doing the loan by being the person the gambler contacts for things like sports betting.

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

But the scene from Season 6 involving Tony's new tab takes place in sopranos time of 2006.  Aka 5 years later.  Artie did not bring up Tony's debt until Tony started giving advice on how to increase business to Vesuvio that Artie found demeaning to his pride.  When Artie brought up Tony owes him money, he points out that Tony paid the entertainment for a 40 person party at Vesuvio that he did for the garbage people for the garbage company he owns.  Artie was not complaining about the 40 person bill and all the other things on the tab.  He complained that Tony paid for the entertainment for the party, including inviting the Actor and Comedian Pat Cooper but he did not pay Artie and thus Tony is taking advantage of him due to his friendship yet he is offering all this friendly but demeaning advice as a friend.  Well a real friend would pay his bill for a friend and need, and not pay for Pat Cooper to show up to entertain people for a party Tony did not make money on (Pat Cooper is a comedian and also has done many movies, but he is also famous for play a mobster in Analyse This, Analyse That, and another mobster movie This Thing of Ours which came out in 2003, aka 3 years prior)

Artie was not trying to guilt tony, he was doing a reactionary counter punch just like Tony always does when he feels uncomfortable and feels shame.  Yes this is not healthy behavior, but it is human behavior and Artie only did it when his friend while helping did not understand he was insulting a man's pride, his life work, and was rubbing his friends nose in his friends failure and making him feel small.  So Artie did a counter punch and make a very good point, Tony owes him money and if he really wants to help he will not be a deadbeat.

So Tony the next day when he is at the pig store / butcher shop Satriale's and he got his first envelope for the day (he is drinking coffee) when Benny drops off the envelope, Tony asks are you going to see your girlfriend / mistress at Vesuvio anyway, Benny says yes, so Tony hands back the envelop and tell Benny to put the money towards his tab at Arties.",1484719234,"he complained that tony paid for the entertainment for the party, including inviting the actor and comedian pat cooper but he did not pay artie and thus tony is taking advantage of him due to his friendship yet he is offering all this friendly but demeaning advice as a friend.","friendly but demeaning","friendly","but",FALSE,"friendly but demeaning","demeaning",NA,NA,1

"db10syc","I saw in the news that Circle is phasing out btc exchanging. This means that you can still hold the bitcoin with them on your wallet but you will no longer be able to buy or sell. Besides, Circle was apparently quite expensive comparatively speaking.  

I researched tips mostly on https://howtobuybitcoin.io/ and got some good redditor advice too. Based on the advice I've received, and in my own experience (I've only starting buying bitcoin recently), there are three 'categories' of bitcoin exchanges.

- **Easy-to-use large places** (like Circle, Coinbase...) offer convenience in exchange for higher fees. Generally speaking this means it's real easy to buy using a credit card or sometimes even PayPal is available. These sites usually have inconvenient buying limits in place. 

- **Slightly less user-friendly but still large platforms** (like Kraken, Gdax, Okcoin..) offer really rock-bottom fees but may not be as straightforward for beginners. These are great sites when you're looking to buy a large amount of bitcoin as the fees you'll pay will be minimal. The extra downside is that these low-fee sites usually never offer convenient deposit methods like debit card (OK kraken does offer SEPA transfer which I have found to be real easy to setup but that's just me!).

-  **Convenient/easy sites that are far smaller** (in terms on users) and not so well known. Some are even situated in countries like Belize or the Caribbean islands so trustworthiness is not guaranteed. These sites incur the largest fees so not great option for yourself looking to buy 3k worth of btc. However many users like these because they sometimes offer no-verification purchases (or minimal ID checks). Some also offer a wide range of payment methods (like Paxful - with over 150 deposit methods). 

In my opinon you're better off going for Kraken (or even Bitstamp if you're in Europe). I'm currently paying my contractors in btc and that has been the easiest and cheapest way for me. Glad to help if you need any tips for those.

"db0vpy5","**So this is kind of long, but it's related to skincare, I swear!**  I am at my mom's place this weekend, which means I get to raid her beauty stash.  She's in her 60's and has focused a lot on her skin after abusing it when she was younger and never wore sunscreen.  Her skincare is an interesting mix of classic drugstore favorites (Pond's Cold Cream, Neutrogena Eye Makeup Remover) and pricy dermatologist's office type brands, like Neocutis and SkinMedica.  

After using some of her more expensive skincare a few times, I've never been blown away by amazing results.  Granted, I'm much younger so many of these products aren't targeted for my skin, and you're not going to see results overnight for most things.  Everything I tried I felt like I had a good dupe of in my own routine, that served the same purpose at much more reasonable price.  The main difference I found was that the packaging on the high-end stuff was all beautiful, heavy, air-less pumps with nice fitting caps.  Not travel friendly, but functional and lovely to look at.

I guess my point is, after trying this expensive skincare, I didn't feel the need to run out and buy any of it.  The experience re-emphasized how easily I can get sucked into the ""oooh pretty! so spendy!  its gotta be good if its that price!"" thought process.  It also made me realize what my actual needs vs. wants are when it comes to skincare.

"db0pbmm","&gt; If you just really like the look and general personality of Japanese breeds, the Kai Ken is actually known for being a lot more friendly and receptive to training, though still with a bit of stubbornness.  
  
I would hesitate to make this assumption. In my experience with the different breeds, the Shiba is the ""easiest."" Sure they are still assholes, but they are predictable. If you have a GOOD Shiba breeder, it's pretty much ""what you see is what you get."" They have been established outside of Japan longer, so the lines here are more reliable - in appearance, health, and behavior. Even in Japan, they have been refined to be solely show and family dogs for decades. The other (medium) breeds may have both working and show lines, but are all much closer to their historical character.  
  
So the Kai in particular - the breed may generally be more people friendly, but they always think for themselves first and have a tendency to spook, shut down, or flee under pressure. An unfortunate number of Kai have been lost because they've escaped or run away when afraid. Additionally, the Kai has the most variance in appearance and build because of multiple [conflicting registries and standards](http://nihonken.blogspot.com/2013/08/kai-ken-registration-and-registries.html).

"dast4af","It was like being punched in the gut. A cold fist of anxiety balled up in his stomach and twisted, making him nauseous. His ears were ringing, and a fine layer of cold sweat had appeared on his skin, beading on the back of his shaking palms.

His hands hovered over the keyboard. His eyes, bloodshot from tears, reread the words over and over again. Everyone had said the meteor was going to miss, that it was going to come close, very close, but ultimately float silently on, leaving a brilliant cosmic fireworks show in its wake.

Apparently there were some miscalculations.

All across the planet, experts scrambled to determine what had gone wrong. Their work rendered moot at this late hour, but what could they do? The same burning desire for discovery and penchant for meticulous analytical thinking that had predestined them for a life of science, now drove them to obsess and infer in their dying hours.

The meteor had splintered in Jupiter's gravity and was now a field of rock, each roughly the size of a large office building. They descended on earth gradually, like a blanket brimming with fire, quietly and deliberately laid on its screaming victim.

The first ones had hit Asia around 6 AM. Pacific Time. They firestorm had been rolling westward ever since. 

So many thoughts flashed in his mind simultaneously. What was one to do at the end of the world? He really wished he had started setting his alarm earlier like he had planned to a month ago. Waking up leisurely at 8:30 had been nice, but his relaxation had cost him precious time for his mind to properly reconcile its annihilation. It had roughly 20 minutes left.

A quiet panic over took him. It physically paralyzed him for a moment, his eyes darting around the room. However he was willed to action. He was an animal after all, and the instinct to fly or fight was strongest in moments such as these.

Fighting was impossible of course. So he left.

His apartment was near the ocean. Many nights he had breathed in the salt and fog from his balcony, wondering and hoping about the future. 

The world outside was awash with activity. It seemed to mirror the inner chaos he was currently experiencing. Running down his stairs had been a bizarre scene of sadness an ecstasy. People were crying and screaming. Loud music cascaded from several apartments. People were drinking and laughing. Some doors were closed, couples tearfully making love, he imagined. 

It seemed the prospect of imminent doom had energized the world with an ecstatic flourish of life. A death throe of love and beauty.

Stepping out into the cool air, his senses were instantly aware, more awake than they had ever been. The sun warmed his face. The breeze cooled it. He breathed in deeply, he smelled food. A hundred different meals being prepared, their scent wafting through the street.

People were parading through the streets. Running wildly, naked and cheering. People were flinging everything from car windows. Paint, confetti, newspapers, money, food. Some had thrown their televisions and computers from out of their windows. Others were staring from their windows or doors, mute, their faces empty.

He walked down the street. The same way he always walked to work, how different his route seemed now. A thousand years of history seemed to burst from every corner, every building, every person. Everything was seen as for the first time, because it was the last time.

A coworker greeted him warmly with a hug. His eyes shining with tears, his face bright with a smile. 
""We're all headed down to Mckenzie's, if you don't want to be alone."" He smiled silently, walking away after another hug.

The fog had just started to lift as he made his way toward the beach. It was the beginning of a beautiful day. The waves calmly washed against the shore, as always. His feet sank into the sand slightly. There were several bonfires burning along the length of the beach. Beds, couches, chairs, benches, car seats, tables and all other assortment of combustible material were gathered in large burning piles. Crowds huddled around them.

She sat alone near the water. They had only spoken a few times. She lived on the same floor, a few doors down. Their conversation was always friendly, but restrained. He had always felt something deep within him when their eyes had met. In the elevator. Across the street. In the laundry room. 

But he had never acted on it. Call it insecurity. Or one of the litany of excuses he had used to talk himself out of really talking to her.

Either way, they were essentially strangers. She sat on the beach, knees drawn up to her chest. Her tears wetting the sand below her.

He sat down beside her, wordlessly. For a while they just sat. He looked out at the ocean. The golden gate peaked out of the fog in the distance. The sun painted the water in front of them. The waves lapped at their feet.

He reached out for her hand. She held it back tightly, looking at him for the first time. She smiled at him through stained eyes.

Behind them, a large cavernous boom rippled. The earth groaned beneath them in protest. Another one crashed. She began to turn around.

He grabbed her arm. ""No, let's not watch"". Together they laid on the sand, in an embrace. He closed his eyes as the thunder washed over them.

But I doubt it since I see it's the same norwegian dude that still owns it and I think the caretaker is the same friendly but very busy deaf guy. Anyway, back in those days he had a room built in the basement under very sketchy circumstances.

It seems to me that looking at the very beginning may bring you some clarity.

Consider how you wrote

&gt;used to awful catcalls on the street, but this man seemed nice:

It seems that you were clearly comparing this man to men who catcall women, men who are rude and can be vulgar. By contrast and comparison, the older man may have *seemed* nice. But if you really think about it, he is an old man hungry for attention, and possibly for something else. And he is apparently texting a 20-something-year-old girl texts which are inappropriate for friends. I assure you, by the time some skeevy men get to that age, they know better than make sexual remarks right out of the gate. Skeevy men get old too, and they get experience.And let me tell you, telling a girl that she is pretty not a friendly introduction; it is flirting. And it is wrong of him to be flirting with girls that were in kindergarten when he was probably in 30's or 40's.

My advice is to quit texting him and quit feeling sorry for him. If he is alone it probably has to do with the fact that he doesn't want to be a woman his own age, and out there flirting with girls who could be his granddaughters. In the meantime, try to be more aware of who you expect to be your ""friend"". An old man who calls you pretty is not looking ""friend"", he is an old man looking for something else. 

Also, it may help you to remember that an old man who flirts with young girls and men who catcall women are both bad example of men, Not all men are like that. If you want to keep a nice person company and want to discuss literature, maybe try visiting a bookstore and talking to  guy your age who is friendly and polite. Nearly all guys will try to butter up a pretty girl if they feel they can, that is not being friendly. But if you see a young, nice-looking guy being friendly with an older or more robust woman, then he is almost certainly not superficial and may be a real, legitimately friendly person.

**Tl;DR** Calling a girl ""pretty"" is not the introduction to a friendship. It is flirting. He never wanted to be your friend. And it is wrong of him to be flirting with girls who were in kindergarten when he was in his 30's or 40's. He is in the wrong, not you. You ready shouldn't feel sorry for people like him.

"d9xfw21","If your not 6'5, ripped, handsome or show some real value to offer then they expect you to fail with them. Many will automatically put up a bitch shield and will not let up unless you are able to impress her somehow. 


So men have to jump through hoops, tests and overcome her bitchiness just to get her to take him seriously as some kind of partner. This includes men who will be in her friend zone. Because women have abundance of men trying to be into their lives. Even 5s and 6s. So they only let the shield down to men who they are attracted to. 


I learned this back in my pick up days. Even though ""Awalt"" is true, I had three different women I dealt with. Women that were into me and they would let me get away with anything. Women that no matter how cool, smooth, or funny I was they were just not into me. They would not give me a time of day. 


Then there were women who were friendly but pretty indifferent. These women were not sexually attracted to me, they were just into seeing what I could do for them. They wanted me to entertain them. They wanted me to buy them something, or help them with something. If I wasn't doing something for them they would leave and never talk to me again. Once I got good at this at the end I was able to figure out who the three women were and get my leads down to ones who were interested. 


But one thing was common in all of them. They all loved attention. Women say they don't like being approached by men they are lying. They need attention or they go crazy. They love any man approaching them. Even ones they are unattracted to because then they get their attention and they can tell other women about the attention they got.

"d9p7mex","Never said he was, but he fulfills an analyst slot. You can't mix and match all of them, especially Dash. Some can only play by play. However, it's about number of talents and how much they entertain and provide quality content. I also think how each personality gets along with the rest is also something to factor in. I don't want to name names, but in my opinion, for NA LCS, they should have ""promoted"" two of the original casters. Both are chemistry breakers (create awkward moments between his co-caster where there is a pause, they don't gel together because he dragged the conversation to a point the other one couldn't possibly follow up on, attacked the other caster somehow, or doesn't playfully follow up on a joke the co-caster said that otherwise any other caster would have). One has no charm at all, and the other is one that we ""love to hate."" I guess you can argue you shouldn't count Dash because his role was an addition. They never had a proper host before. However, he was an added personality to the analyst desk that has 3-4 people usually, and casting has 2-3. Of course you can't hire too many people that only excel in one role, but for the most part, because all the color casters can do it all and most are color casters, I'm blurring them into one thing. To bring life to the games being caster, 3-4 likeable (not necessarily friendly, but more in a professional sense) and knowledgeable on the analyst desk, and 2-3 casting with one of them being able to be critical in real time. To expand on what I mean by likable, Monte doesn't have a warm personality. He's very critical, opinionated, and is more than willing to argue his point. However, he's professional about it and doesn't throw his colleagues under the bus to get his way. He acknowledges other people have differing opinions and helps facilitate dissecting the games that helps spectators think about it at a deeper level. He's likable because it's awesome to have a personality like his contrasting most others. Because of this, he has really great chemistry with others that are vocal whether or not agreeing or arguing with him. This is what the analyst desk is for anyway. He's also a great color caster. I haven't seen too much of him and PapaSmithy, but while casting, the most I've ever seen from any duo is someone pointing an oversight. Not necessarily an argument. Some chemistry breakers on the analyst desk would argue something, and give up settling on agreeing to disagree. Mainly because their argument was stupid and they just gave up. No value there. Casting is much easier to recognize when you have a chemistry breaker. All casters should be able to adapt but for the most part, most casters have pleasant personalities that naturally get along with others. The magic happens when you have contrasting personalities really getting along. Back in the day, I thought it was Deman and Jatt. Pure color with a pure play by play. Deman had the voice and enthusiasm and was really quick to describe in general what was going on and raising his voice on highlight plays while Jatt expertly detailed the game. Jatt also has a good sense of humor and usually would go wherever Deman was going. If not, it would just spin as another joke. No awkward pauses. It would just be funny that Jatt didn't find it funny or Deman went too far, and Deman would make fun of the situation. They just kept going. This duo was easily beaten by Monte and DoA though. Even more contrasting and a lot more layers to their humor. Then you have a few chemistry breakers that drag or push the other outside of their comfort zone or they break the flow, move away from what was just said and force the other to join them. Some personalities are also just dead inside. I count one each from NA and EU that are zombie-like casters, and one each that occasionally push or pull whoever they are casting with. But in general, we just want a cast that's entertaining. I think Dash, Zirene, and Azael are all solid talents that keep the streams going and hope Riot discovers more and gets rid of old talent that didn't adapt or grow.

In Asia, this means work, friends of friends, or school. (Sitting at a bar is okay, too). 

I do not, however, ever speak to strangers who approach me. Usually, they want to practice English, or are merely curious about you. They can sign up for a language school, and their curiosity isn't my concern.

Don't get sucked into conversations you don't want- simply tell someone you're busy, smile, and go back to your phone.

"d8tv2wd","Maybe this very simple description can change your view... women often marry men that they wouldn't have dated 5 or 10 years ago. That's the most charitable interpretation of the ridiculously dumb jargon ""AA/BB"". Not much more, not much less -- everything else that's implied is common sense. For example, you might sensibly worry that the chick isn't actually attracted to her husband if she wouldn't have dated him when boyfriends were chosen based more on fun and sexiness. 

And honestly, if you ever find yourself knowing older, nerdier men, they often have kids with some sexy fucking chicks that are way out of their league. The guys have bad social skills, gross bodies, and are obsessed from their line of work with topics that most people in the general population find devoid of cultural worth. Think engineer, programmer, statistician (for insurance, etc.), mathematician, technical academic (less true for more flowery academics), etc. These guys do things that most people find boring for work with no cultural value, make decent to great money, and also often live actually boring lives. They're frequently out of shape too, gross even.

To a much lesser extent, some lawyers and doctors can fall into this category. Tons of higher paying jobs just tend to bring out better quality men into them for whatever reason. Think financial trader -- still technical and uninteresting, but well cut men flock to the field. Lawyers, doctors, etc. are somewhere in the middle but still get great men in droves. Managers, corporate business, etc. tend to bring in better quality men to their fields as well. IMO, it's because these fields generally require more social skills -- the type of skills that are beyond ""clear and friendly"" but closer to ""political and conniving"". Weaker men tend to stress out, have anxiety, and get passive aggressive. They get eaten alive in those types of scenarios, and need fields that are more about ""I produced this thingy that makes +5 units of worth, give me more money!!""

"d7jszyi","EV was okay as a first one, although I used to hate Soa when they didn't put shadows/markers on the ground. Stealth characters running between bosses one and two was about the highlight.

KP was okay before they nerfed the Fabricator. The rest of it is passably dull. It's always been the easiest.

EC came next, iirc. Christ, I remember trying Z&amp;T and you used to stand them in the stupidest places. That took forever to clear. Then FB and Stormcaller, equally painful back in the day. Minefield was always dull. Kephess was jokingly difficult to start with, everyone hated it. NiM Kephess was insanely challenging mechanically and completely unforgiving. Used to be funny when the trash was so challenging that people uysed to run over the roof. Good times.

What's next, TFB? Okay, I love TFB. First boss was a quick kill, then the Dread Guard were awesome. Op IX is comfortably my favourite boss ever, and is great fun. NiM on that was awesome (jebus, trying to get the timing on that was hysterical, people screaming on chat because one side is on 5% and the other is on 40% and oh shit we're 20s in and the reset will fuck us). It's just great, and looks fabulous. Kephess here was never a favourite, I always found it a bit ragged in terms of hitboxes, and it's never been challenging. TFB was hysterical, mostly because it took you several weeks to learn the first phase, at which point you'd spawn into p2, die in 30s, and have to start again. Talk about unforgiving. More panicky moves to get everyone on separate platforms. TFB, overall, is really solid.

S&amp;V has good and bad. First boss is annoying and has too much RNG (getting sent to the sand twice in a row used to mean too much trouble), the second boss was pretty simple. The rancor is funnily challenging on NiM (the 50-40% double knock-back was always hellish). I remember when the little 'bonus' guys just past there at the back were the hardest thing in there. The alarm one is/always was easy, although being Blue Team would often mean being late to the boss in NiM because of the lack of run/speed (yeah, rest of raid group setting off alarms, I'm looking at you). Sales guy used to be horribly RNG-y, so you'd reset the thing to get a completable puzzle, and NiM downstairs resulted in a few comedy deaths before re-scaling. Warlords has my favourite intro scene, loads of fun. NiM with the guy when you were running lengths was painfully annoying, but mechanically it was generally easy. Final boss is great fun, nice balance of challenge and reward, and for once isn't massively one-sided in favour of ranged or melee (although the KBs in NiM were pretty integral). Liked it loads.

Dread Palace opens well - Bestia (quite good fun), Tyrans (hysterically chaotic every time) starts strongly, wavers a bit through Calyphayus (meh, weirdly balanced in non-NiM) and then Raptus (which went from too easy to too hard because of balance issues in the challenge phases), but ends with Dread Council, which is good fun ultimately, and really challenging technically. This Op is one of the few where deeps are really challenged tactically/technically, which I think is good. Council in particular needs really good team co-ordination.

Dread Fortress starts poorly (Nefra is a waste of time), moves onto Draxus which again involves everyone tactically which I like, and takes a while to get roles sorted (this is great when you have a settled group, but then if you swap into different groups, assigning intterupts etc can be painful). Grob'thok is harder in HM than NiM, but is dull, and Corruptor Zero is also dull as dishwater. Brontes - well, Brontes is *interesting*. One that takes an age to learn, and like TFB is frustrating as you learn each segment but get to a point where upto Brontes is on farm, but you're killing 10 mins a time just learning the positioning for Brontes (especially tanks).

Finally, ToS and Rav. ToS is a mix of fun and awful - the adds are massively pointlessly OP (in that they take forever), then Malaphar is a waste of everyone's time. Sword Squadron is far more fun (although I preferred it when as a tank we used to actually swap, which caused no end of amusement running around). If anyone tells you that Underlurker isn't just the buggiest shittiest boss there is, they're lying, and it's awful. Commanders is dull and easy, and Revan in SM is even easier. In HM he's stupidly challenging, and once again the learning curve/balance within the Op is horrible.

Ravagers starts with Sparky, who is kinda dull but requires some effort on the part of off-tanks. Bulo is okay, but with timings required, you can find yourself thinking it's too easy, and suddenly because you've upped your dps you're out of sync. Frustrating. Torque is horribly ranged-friendly, but quite fun, and M&amp;B in HM is back to super-challenging (but in SM, is jsut plain dull). Coratanni is another average boss.

Ultimately, BW hit it just right around the DP/DF segment, when they still cared. Me, I'm all about that TFB, but that's mostly reminiscing about NiM.

The problem, particularly when they nerfed everything, is that they made Ops either incredibly simple, tactically, or nightmareishly difficult, which meant that new/inexperienced players didn't learn anything from early bosses and Ops, and then found themselves massively out of their depth later on. Similarly, the rebalance when they made everything 65 kept most easy, but some incredibly challenging due to step changes. The idea of giving us everything again at 65 was great, but simply multiplying the HP or dmg by x was just ineffective (DP and DF NiM now are incredibly challenging even in super-gear, and whilst old-school raiders had fun, it meant that new players just couldn't get going, and even old hands weren't interested in re-running Ops simply because they had become unreasonably difficult simply due to dmg counts, rather than tactical nuance).

I'm not including Ziost here because afaik, it's been broken since ever (so I've never been when it's doable - apologies if that's changed), or the Golden Cow, because that was a pointless exercise in killing time with no tactical nuance whatsoever (the forerunner to tactical FPs).",1473701882,"torque is horribly ranged-friendly, but quite fun, and m&amp;b in hm is back to super-challenging (but in sm, is jsut plain dull).","friendly, but quite","friendly","but",TRUE,"friendly , but quite fun","fun",NA,"quite",1

Keep in mind that this is the ONLY NHL game my grandpa has EVER gone to as he lived in rural Manitoba during the Jets 1.0 era.

If a male coworker texts her something about work, she responds as quickly as she can.

If he texts her something personal, or flirty, or something that is obvious that he is trying to gauge interest...she will purposefully take her sweet ass time responding.  And when she does, she will ignore the other stuff and go back to talking about work.

In her mind, this draws a clear line in the sand.  I'm only interested in being coworkers.  That does not mean that in the future the coworker bond might not turn into friendship...but at least the guy knows on the front end that she is not interested in anything else.

Think of texting as an actual in person conversation.

If you walk up to a dude and start to flirt...and he immediately responds and the two of you start having a deep conversation about likes, and wants, yada yada yada.  There is a good chance that you are going to infer that he is interested.  

In that same scenario..you walk up to a dude and he pays more attention to everyone else at the table than you...you are most likely going to infer that he is not interested.

3 - Ensuring there are no distractions from theme
2 - Friendly staff/bartenders

Of the limited tiki bars I've been to, only Three Dots and A Dash nailed it in my opinion. The atmosphere grabbed you immediately and the soft sounds of exotica lulled you away from downtown Chicago into a fantastic fantasy. These both happen before you even see the bar or menu. You order a drink and taste it next. That's how every visit to a bar operates. If the trifecta isn't hit in that order, the illusion is shattered. Once you are fully absorbed into the atmosphere/music/flavor then you begin to notice the rest. I personally like to see what mugs wash drink comes in and if I can take a little bit of paradise home with me. Strength of the cocktail is always secondary to flavor. It's like session beers in the brewing world (of which I am a brewmaster). Of the flavor is great, no one minds of its only 4%. Means they can have more. But a heavy hitter is always popular. Each style of cocktail will have its fanclub. Also not everyone you comes in is going to drink, but will definitely enjoy the atmosphere/music. Originality is a hard one to hit. Everyone kind of had the same vision of a tiki bar in their heads. It's part of our pop culture and is a shared fantasy. The classics deserve recognition but only the die hard fans will care or notice the nods to them. Keeping people in their ""escape"" is important. No one wants to go home from a vacation, why should they want to leave? Bartenders and staff should be friendly, but I don't think anyone will assume they aren't supposed to be. It's a common expectation that the staff be friendly and efficient anymore. Food is last as it's not anything I remember from my tiki bar visits. Psycho Suzi's in Minneapolis does pizza and American fare, three dots had food but I didn't order it cause that's not why I was there.

"d6qncjt","I'm gonna copy and paste it from another thread, if you don't mind.

**1. What makes you respect individuals, groups, or organizations? List whatever you can think of.**

Their deeds, I think. They matter the most. Of course, if they did something wrong but they meant right, I can still look up to them – but I will respect them even more when they learn from it. Also, their attitude to people is very important.

**2. What kind of things turn you off about a person, a brand/company, or a particular environment? What gets under your skin (in a bad way)?**

I hate when people are self-centered, especially when facing a difficult situation. It’s important to care about yourself, but when you don’t care about the others, the whole concept of society falls apart – and I don’t mean it in a “love-everyone-and-share-everything-no-matter-what” way, it’s just that you really should be nice to others if you want them to be nice to you. As for the companies, I don’t like when they try to convey political messages or promote agendas in their advertising.

**3. How good is your memory for detail? Specific conversations you've had in the past, little tasks that need to get done, what you were doing the first time you heard a song or tried a food, etc.**

My memory is okay I guess, I always catch myself thinking about a song I’ve heard 10 years ago and then it won’t leave my head. It’s kind of problematic – there were many times when I had a very important test and some stupid song just wouldn’t stop playing on repeat in my head. It makes it really difficult for me to focus (and it’s already pretty bad!)

**4. What do you spend the most time thinking about - the past, the present, the future? Practical topics, logistical issues, relationships with people, theoretical concepts, issues of morality/ethics? Do you find yourself fixating on one thing, coming back to it, and trying to figure it out, or are you more prone to meandering through multiple tangentially related topics? Do you often daydream/space out? When you do daydream or fantasize, what kind of things do you imagine and think about?**

I usually think of the future and the past, rarely the present. I really enjoy theoretical concepts, analyzing them, breaking them down and finding the origin of problems. I also have lots of projects I begin to realize until I’m bored of them. When I daydream, it’s usually about the near future or something completely abstract. I like to make up lore for stories that will probably never see the light of day.

**5. Think about a topic or two you're really interested in and like having conversations about. Do you think you would generally have more fun talking about that topic with an enthusiastic, curious listener who asks you lots of great questions, or do you think you would generally have more fun listening to an interesting, entertaining person talk at length about it and answer your questions enthusiastically?**

I guess it’s be movies and technology/science. I’m not really sure though, I think that even with all of those crazy ideas in my head I’m still a very boring person. I come from a rather poor family and I haven’t experienced as many things as my friends did – all of them travel to exotic places and I haven’t even been to an airport. I used to be very upset about this as a kid but now I’ve got used to it. Anyway, I think that I would rather listen to a person if he’s more knowledgeable and talk if they have similar experience.

**6. In the last question, what topic(s) were you think about?**

As I said, movies and science.

**7. If someone is doing something that you strongly disagree with, how likely are you to confront them about it? If you do confront them, how do you usually tend to do it? How does your answer change depending on your relationship with the person, and whether their actions directly affect you?**

Probably not at all. I used to be really shy – I’m growing out of it, but still I prefer not to interfere in things that others do, especially strangers. If it was a family member or a friend, I would probably say that it makes no sense and explain why.

**8. How interested are you in trying new things - traveling, trying strange and exotic foods, going on roller coasters, jumping out of airplanes, things like that? Regardless of how interested you are, how willing would you be to do those things if someone asked you to? How often do you actually do things like that? Give examples.**

Traveling? Yup, love it. Exotic foods are interesting too. The last time I’ve been on a rollercoaster was ages ago, but I think that it was pretty fun. Jumping out of airplanes? Hell no. Even if someone begged me to do it. Well, if they paid me, then maybe… Otherwise, I really doubt it.

**9. How would other people describe your demeanor? It may help to ask people you know. How emotional do you seem to people? How rational? Do you tend to be quiet and reserved, or more loud and talkative? Do you seem to choose your words carefully, or talk stream of consciousness, or do you sometimes think so fast you stumble trying to get all the words out? Do you tend to finish your sentences, or skip to the next sentence in the middle of the one you're saying, or skip to new topics entirely? Do you interrupt - if so, when and how often? How do you feel if someone interrupts you? How often do you feel like you have so much energy you can't sit still and need to be up and moving? How hard is it for you to get out of bed in the morning, or get up after relaxing for a long time?**

My friends usually describe me as creative, witty and friendly, but I guess they think that I’m pretty stand-offish and, uh, rude? I hate impoliteness but I can’t help but think that some people peg me as insensitive. Maybe it’s because of my rather quiet demeanor? I enjoy being in the spotlight, but I’m actually a little bit terrified of someone trying to get to know about my private life. Even though the financial situation has been getting better each year, I still am afraid that I don’t fit in (I attend a private school where majority of people is rather affluent).

When I speak, I usually change the topics all the time, especially when I’m excited about something. I’ve always been talkative – to the point that I constantly interrupted my teacher when I was little. I remember that I talked to basically everyone and I still enjoy it. Now I’m more self-conscious and have a bit of a problem with that. I have no problem with someone interrupting me (unless I really needed to focus on what I’m talking about). I’m usually pretty mellow, unless I’m doing something I’m passionate about, like doing something creative, especially with other people.

**10. We've all had conversations with someone who was 'missing the point'. Give an example or two, real or imagined, of conversations that would make you feel that way - what is the ""point"", and how is the other person missing it?**

Sometimes people think that I criticize them but I’m just trying to thoroughly analyze their behavior. Other than that, I dunno.

**11. How long does it usually take you to realize/decide that you are unhappy with a situation in your life (e.g. job, relationship)? Do you talks to others to figure out your feelings, or are you more likely to keep it to yourself until you've figured it out? At what stage would you discuss the issue with the affected parties (boss, S.O.)? Are you likely to change your mind after announcing your decision? How difficult are changes like this for you to adapt to? How often do you experience big changes like this? Do you feel like these changes are more the result of your own decisions and opinions, or are they more the inevitable result of external circumstances?**

Not too long. I like consulting things with my parents or my best friend. This way, I can see the problem through their eyes. I usually try to be self-reliant and solve problems on my own, though. I really dislike changes, especially rapid ones. I prefer to know about them in advance and make some plans. I believe that their origin depends on the changes themselves.

**12. What are your age, gender, and nationality, if you feel comfortable sharing?**

"d6qme2g","Stopped talking to a coworker/friend in another department because I realized she had the two personality traits I absolutely hate in people: narcissism and childishness. She throws tantrums for everything including me not answering her texts quickly enough at work, me not giving her my phone to use when she uses up all her data, not winning a card game she wanted to play, or when she sets up plans with other coworkers and tells me at the last minute and I have other plans and can't go. Everything is about her and I'm just over it. Other examples of self centered behavior include the time her mother insisted that she pay for her own cellphone bill now that she was a full time employee with a salary and she argued that her mother should continue paying for it since the mother had recently gotten remarried and now had her husband's income for additional support. She's 25 and still expects her mom to pay her bills.

I should have gotten rid of her last year when she started some high school level drama with some coworkers. My company brings in a handful of co-op students from other countries and last year they brought in a guy that she thought was cute. She told him she liked him and he politely told  her that he just wanted to be friends. She ""accepted"" it and move on. Several days later, I matched with the same guy on Tinder which is pretty popular among the single co-ops. She took my phone to have a conversation with him and promised to keep everything friendly (I've learned my lesson when it comes to having a password that everyone knows or letting people see my phone without knowing their intentions). At some point she set up a date for later that week between me and  him and I had enough platonic interest in him to agree to it. Especially since it was understood that this was supposed to be two friends getting dinner and not a real date. The date itself was platonic and friendly but that didn't stop her from going back to the condo she shared with two other co-ops and throwing a huge fit along the lines of ""Why her and not me?"". She sulked around her condo for several days, the dude avoided her like the plague for like two weeks, and everyone else who knew of the date never brought it up again.

She sent me several texts since I stopped talking her and I haven't bothered to look at any of them. I feel mild guilt for not missing her at all, only to realized that she's never been there for me as a friend like I have for her when it comes to the smaller things or the bigger things such as begging me to edit her resume to look like mine for her application to become a full time employee. I didn't gain much from the friendship. I'm concerned about her turning other coworkers against me but other than that I'm pretty satisfied having her out my life.

"d6qavru","Speaking as someone who moved from a non rural to a rural area for few years, the docs can make a lot of money, but likely had to work up to those almost double national average salaries. 


Problems practicing there are patients aren't very compliant as they don't seek care due to lifestyle, distance, or cannot afford it. So often it turns into not ideal situations for cases. 


Another thing you should consider, if you want to have a kid, you may not want to have them live there. The schools in these places may very well be subpar. Do they work and good students come out ok? Yes, but my experience was that it was not a good college prep at all. I personally experienced being able to draw a family tree with 4 generations on it, and 50% of the students and teachers are on the tree together. There is nothing wrong with this other than the fact that everybody is family so there is a lot of leniency with discipline.


This was just the experience I had, and may not be indicative of yours. The people are wonderful and very friendly, but going from a college prep school to a rural private school, it was a stark change.


Ideally, ask for the 7 days on and off package with the hospital compensating you with a hotel room for the week. Each physician I spoke to did this or had their kids driven 1 HR to the nearest prep school. 


You could try to do homeschooling, but those I've met who went that route struggled socially. Also you need to make sure the teacher is good as ultimately the parents are accountable.


It's a whole other way of living than most are used to, so don't get blinded by the $$$ or you're going to be pretty miserable as there's a reason those values are up there.

"d6q7qg8","&gt;Maybe because I have a premier account? I don't know.

My experience with BofA is that they treat clients very differently depending upon their value to the bank, and, despite being such a large company, depending upon relationships with individuals in the bank.

I've had almost entirely great experiences with their service, especially in situations where I've absolutely needed something (from waiving fees without even being asked up to getting us out of foreign countries after being called on a shaky voip connection through unreliable public wifi), but that seems to be because I deal with them primarily through my account managers, whom I've known for many years, and because our investment accounts bring them a reasonable amount per year in account fees. 

Even before we had investments there, though, I got great service as a teenager there with only ~$10k in accounts because I knew a branch manager who trusted me, letting me open a full checking account in my name alone despite being a minor.

Simple, on the other hand, has had such horrible service for me that I no longer use my account there at all. Credit unions have usually been friendly but unreliable, and have usually had significantly worse account terms than BofA. Schwab has been decent, but not great, and still won't activate mobile deposit for me because I don't direct deposit anything into my accounts there.

In general, banking is based on value and trust. The more value you bring to the bank, and the more they trust you, the better you'll be treated. If you bring no value and they don't trust you, you probably won't get good service anywhere. Thus small credit unions with easy personal connections and restrictive client bases (eg, a small university credit union) often work better if you don't bring much value.

I'm a little confused by what you mean by turned off.  What makes you think they are turned off?  This is important.  Are you asking a million micromanagement level questions during the RP?  Because that can be annoying.  I don't mean to be rude but this is in the name of getting you more action.


My opinion: You don't need to show that you are kind IRL, you need to show that you are respectful.  Respect is number one in this arena.  I am happy to be able to say that my non-con partners have been among the most respectful partners I've had!  OOC communications need to be friendly but casual, never clingy (these aren't accusations directed at you, they are things I would recommend to anyone).


The initial PMs need to include a clear understanding of limits.  Are they okay with name calling/excessive violence/facials/insertions/whatever.  Getting super detailed would be overkill, as the target I wouldn't want to be asked about positions--you're writing as the rapist or dom, it's your call.  I always assume oral/facefucking is on the table for non-con, I guess you could ask but I would say it's unnecessary.  


It's a character.  If a guy says something disgusting to me in a RP, I don't take it personally because it's just a game.  If you're going to play dom, you've got to go ALL IN.  I was curious about femdom and wrote some prompts, but I just couldn't go all in.  You don't need to prove that you're nice IRL, just be respectful when OOC and it's all good!  And this is just me, but lots of OOC niceties kill the vibe.

Some things you should definitely do around town is brunch at Tugboat Annie's, and then rent some kayaks from them as well to burn off some of the calories you just gained from them.

Alex Hannum was the coach for Chamberlain's first championship, although it was not in 1964 with the Warriors, when they lost in the Finals, but in 1967 with the Sixers.  [Here's what Wikipedia says about the 1966-67 season:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilt_Chamberlain#Philadelphia.2FSan_Francisco_Warriors_.281959.E2.80.931965.29)

&gt;Prior to the 1966–67 NBA season, the friendly but unassertive Schayes was replaced by a familiar face, the crafty but firm Alex Hannum. In what Cherry calls a tumultuous locker room meeting, Hannum addressed several key issues he observed during the last season, several of them putting Chamberlain in an unfavorable light. Sixers forward Chet Walker testified that on several occasions, players had to pull Chamberlain and Hannum apart to prevent a fistfight. Fellow forward Billy Cunningham observed that Hannum ""never backed down"" and ""showed who was the boss"". By doing this, he won Chamberlain's respect. When emotions cooled off, Hannum pointed out to Chamberlain that he was on the same page in trying to win a title; but to pull this off, he – like his teammates – had to ""act like a man"" both on and off the court. Concerning basketball, he persuaded him to change his style of play. Loaded with several other players who could score, such as future Hall-of-Famers Hal Greer and newcomer Billy Cunningham, Hannum wanted Chamberlain to concentrate more on defense.

&gt;As a result, Chamberlain was less dominant, taking only 14% of the team's shots (in his 50.4 ppg season, it was 35.3%), but extremely efficient: he averaged a career-low 24.1 points, but he led the league in rebounds (24.2), ended third in assists (7.8), had a record breaking .683 field goal accuracy, and played strong defense. For these feats, Chamberlain earned his third MVP award. The Sixers charged their way to a then-record 68–13 season, including a record 46–4 start. In addition, the formerly egotistical Chamberlain began to praise his teammates, lauding hardworking Luke Jackson as the ""ultimate power forward"", calling Hal Greer a deadly jumpshooter, and point guard Wali Jones an excellent defender and outsider scorer. Off the court, the center invited the team to restaurants and paid the entire bill, knowing he earned 10 times more than all the others. Greer, who was considered a consummate professional and often clashed with the center because of his attitude, spoke positively of the new Chamberlain: ""You knew in a minute the Big Fella [Chamberlain] was ready to go... and everybody would follow.""",1469362572,"e2.80.931965.29)  &gt;prior to the 1966–67 nba season, the friendly but unassertive schayes was replaced by a familiar face, the crafty but firm alex hannum.","friendly but unassertive","friendly","but",FALSE,"friendly but unassertive","unassertive",NA,NA,1

"d53mza4","Hey there, engineering is great!  Sure, you won't be an overnight millionaire, but overall there is less than 3% unemployment for engineers and you have a much higher than average starting salary.  I'm not sure what your dad is expecting since anything more lucrative for a recent grad (medical, investment banking, big law) is much harder to get into, much more expensive of a degree, or both.  So yeah, quite simply, he doesn't know what he's talking about.

As for choosing a college, I actually recommend in-state for you.  You'll save on tuition and even a different city will still feel like a different universe if you decide not to go home very often.  I live 30 minutes from my home town but see my family less than once per month.  You'll be surprised how lazy your parents actually are, and they will likely not visit.

And if they do, your school (and all schools) cannot give your parents information about you according to federal law.  They won't know your grades, schedule, loan amounts, dorm building, room, etc., unless you tell them yourself.  They won't be permitted entry to your dorm without you signing them in.  If they call the school demanding to talk to you, a friendly but stern housing administration staffer will politely refuse.  The most they can force is a wellness check on you, which will be performed by University staff or police, who will be annoyed that you have 'those kind of parents,' but otherwise won't care.  If you ask the University in the proper way, the school will not even admit that you are a student, and tell anyone who asks that they cannot confirm nor deny that you even exist.

So don't worry too much about separation, since college truly can be a severence with anyone you don't want around.

As for engineering, you'll want to go into mechanical engineering or aerospace engineering (if the school has that specific major), since both can get you into aerospace.  If you want to go into aerospace materials engineering (inventing new plastics and stuff) then civil engineering is something to look at, otherwise stick to ME and AE.

Just do well on the ACT (retake as necessary), and pay attention in any high school math, physics and chemistry courses you might take.  Those are all repeated your first semester of college as an engineer, so knowing them well will make your first year a lot easier.

"d4wiuvs","Hi there, stayxvicious. Certainly living up to the name huh :) ? I'm going to assume you haven't seen many kratom sites these days because what I do is the norm or less. I won't resort to harsh words but there is obviously much you need to learn about Kratom and how it is sold in the United States with the go ahead from the FDA before you make such claims as to me being unethical and claiming I have ANY negative impact on the sales or legality of kratom.

First of all, the soapmaking and aromatherapy talks are par for the course in this area. It is absolutely kosher and really the ONLY way you can sell or import kratom into this country. End of story. I didn't pop up overnight. I've been around years and have a loyal following. I've got thousands of registered users and FB members to my ""disgusting site"" that have found relief through it. I know exactly what I'm doing and when I don't have a friendly but expensive lawyer who works WITH the FDA to make sure my site is up to snuff.

Nowhere do I talk about feeling psychoactive properties from soap. No where do I mention consumption. No where do I sell or promote caps. No where is there anything endangering kratom and if there is, point it out and Ill pull it immediately. Talk of Aroma is the de facto standard for all kratom vendors, so why pick on me? Apparently you haven't seen many kratom vending sites or forums. Almost all talk is of Aroma. It has been deemed safe in the community, in fact I have full blessings of the AKA and most all my other domestic counterparts. If they don't have an issue, and the FDA doesn't, why do you? Makes one wonder. I'm starting to see why this subreddit has the reputation of shilling and bad mouthing, as this is totally unnecessary.

I made a conscious choice to come as close as I legally can spreading awareness to addicts and pain patients without endangering kratoms future (you think I'm about to shoot my self in the foot by helping get it banned when I spent years building this?!). Guess what? IT WORKED. In fact I am so concerned about it I offer my hundreds of a other customers, 90% of which return happy and have no issues with my site, ounces of free kratom to fight bills passed in various state by writing appropriate parties. I work closely with members of BLD and AKA to make sure we bring the fight for kratom to the front lines. What other vendor does that? Sounds ethical to me. In fact that  sounds more like I GO ABOVE AND BEYOND to ensure kratoms legality. Yes it is getting banned in other states. I'm part of the solution, not the problem. What have you done to help? I've got a list of the bills I helped fight, you?
 
I chose a stance intentionally to make kratom more appealing to people with drug abuse problems, as it saved me from the depths of opiate addiction,  without crossing the line with the FDA. In order to reach addicts I have to appeal to them. The end justifies the means. I have  tiptoed around words, but I do it in a way that does not put my business or the plant, or any other plant I sell for that matter, in any jeopardy whatsoever. I would know, I spent years working on it and had it combed over by an attorney who specializes in importation and FDA lingo and wording and what to avoid. Do you know more than this attorney? I talk to my contact in the FDA in person a few times a month just to be sure. Do you?  Because I'd much rather pay you as I bet your rate is cheaper. You need to brush up on FDA laws a bit first though. This is the leading attorney in this area based out of Miami and has been in practice for 20 years. But because someone on reddit said I was unethical and disgusting, they must be right.

First and foremost I started this company to save lives, not make money. I make money from Amazon FBA, I don't need to deal with the FDA and the warzone that has become kratom and botanical vending.Despite that I have forged bonds in Indonesia that gives me the highest quality kratom for the lowest prices in the country. I'll take the pepsi challenge any day.  I do this because I care and because I've watched it saved peoples lives. MANY LIVES. All the testimonials on my site are written verbatim, I'm a sponsored and verified vendor other major kratom sites and forums. I have twice the positive feedback of most ""major"" vendors where I am sponsored. Here is proof http://www.drugbuyersguide.net/index.php?/forum/115-approved-kratom-vendors/ 

I've had people invite me to their homes to thank me for supposedily saving their life, or that of a family member, just for introducing them or a loved one to a plant that helped drug use/abuse for them. Who are you? What have you done for this plant? I get it to the people who need it.  I consider my customers friends and I consider kratom a miracle. I protect both consciously and fiercely. If this is unethical, better bust out a Merriam's my friend. 

Let me explain a few things so you understand my position. First of all the model I follow is INCREDIBLY mild in regards to most other vendors, including some of the major ones that get a lot of lip service here without being ""disgusting or unethical"". I can gladly paste some of the terminology my competitors use if you think I'm anywhere NEAR crossing the line. Name ONE Statute I have infringed upon in regards  to the FDA. Oh, wait........you don't know any. You just know how to blindly curse in a general direction. Hint: your facing the wrong way, plenty of others to yell at that do what you claim I do.
 
I'll let some others know of this thread, even the circle of vendors that all operate with impunity, and if they like they can tell you themselves how disgusting and unethical I have been, pulling them from a life of misery into one of natural balance. Or just other fellow vendors that aren't subject to ignorant posts like yours. I am friendly with mostly all of them. I just have better kratom for cheaper. Don't you think they would let me know if I was out of line? Kratom is there bread and butter and we talk all the time. I Cater to addicts and pain patients who have no options left but death or a life of misery. In doing so I had to ride a fine line, but it has not been crossed. If it has, I'm a very reasonable man, and I will remove or change it. You are about the last person who is qualified to make that decision, until I start hearing statutes from you I have violated. Which one was it again?, I've got the FDA's PDF open right in front of me. Im not seeing anything but blind anger.

"d43gc88","I'm not really seeing how existing mods don't meet all of these requirements already.

&gt; Alteration: The ability to completely alter both yourself, the caster, and the world around you. You didn’t get much of that in skyrim. You go flesh spells, equilibrium, and some utility spells. Most of those are easily replaced by enchanting or mods installed. PerMa got close in regards with the altering of the rest of the world, via kinetic spells, and ordinator came close with some alter-self perks. Expanding upon these two could really bring alteration to fruition. Some expansion in both of these fields, as well as some perks enhancing flesh spells, not in armor rating or duration, would fill out what was previously a useless tree.

Well, obviously alteration should affect the world. The next problem is that you can't actually affect the world because you can't cast spells on anything that isn't an actor. You won't get much close than Apocalypse's Find Ore/Fabricate Object/Detonate Lock type spells in terms of mechanics.

Note that enhancing flesh spells by adding different effects just amounts to perks that add those effects directly. This is a mistake many perk overhauls make: ""When you have a full set of glass armor, you gain 5% magic resistance"" or ""When Ebonyflesh is active, you gain 5% magic resistance"" is essentially the same perk as ""5% magic resistance"" because you only take it if you meet the criterion. This then leads to a tree full of boring perks.

&gt; Conjuration: while still much better in terms of usefulness than alteration, it still falls behind the level of Destruction and Restoration status, not filling the quota as a “required” skill set for a mage. Sure, the necromancy perks allows it to be more viable for necromancers, but suiting one class isn’t enough. I recommend a bone harvesting skill, much like that in PerMa or SkyRim, but with a limit to the summoning of infinite minions, exchanging sheer numbers for usability. Atronachs also have to be able to be upgraded, because no one really still uses a weak flame atronach when you can use a strong storm atronach. Make them more equally powerful, and add some new spells to their repertoire as you increase your skill.

Ordinator does all of this. (It literally has a Bone Collector perk and branch, and upgradeable atronach with auras and new spells through Unleash Hell/Daedra's Due).

&gt; As for Dremora Lords, they should be much, much more powerful

*wat*

Dremora Lords are the true Dragonborn already. There should be more different ones, which is why Apocalypse has 11 of them (Churl, Pit Fighter, Xivilai Sorcerer, Champion, Honor Guard, Mentor, Herne, Xivilai Lord, Assassin, Lord of Bindings, Weeping Daedra).

&gt; and a high-tier perk should allow them to open up an Oblivion Gate, due to their high ranking as dremora officers.

Ah yes, the amazingly buggy PerMa perk. If nothing else, you will run into the unavoidable problem that the dremora it spits out either can't be traced back to you (allowing you to kill anything without taking a bounty) or they can with some clever on-hit perks (while you still can't control what the dremora will attack or stop them from doing so).

To do it properly, the gate itself needs to be a summoned minion, something like a stationary version of Apocalypse's Herne and Lord of Bindings. Definitely possible, but still not ""needed"" because Oblivion Gates are not a tactical combat tool and any individual who could restart the plot of TES Oblivion by themselves would probably get hunted down by the armies of every country in existence and buried in a soul gem in a large block of concrete in a lead vessel under constant monitoring.

&gt; Destruction: The pure form of magical damage. However, there isn’t anything pure about it. You have fire, frost, and shock, not pure magic. I would like for a minor expansion to those trees, and I mean MINOR. I would like for less perks being added in those branches, but make them all very useful, i.e. quality over quantity. This would allow for a fourth branch, specializing in, boosting, and yielding sets of pure magic spells. Blasts of white energy, straight from the blessing of magnus’ light, not twined to an element.

Spectraverse?

&gt; Enchanting: a lack of actually chanting.

Well, this came so far out of left field that it might be from outside the observable universe.

UESP on enchanting:  
*Enchanting is the act of endowing objects with magical properties through the use of a soul, almost always with the use of a soul gem. An enchanted item's power diminishes with use, in which case additional souls may be used to replenish it. The strength of an enchanted item and the amount by which it can be recharged is directly related to the magnitude of the souls used.[19]*

&gt; Illusion: Phantoms, Puppets, Dreams, etc. Nothing staying with the base game. The skyrim version of illusion magic is about manipulation of emotion, not dream magic or puppeteering. That being said, it didn’t do what it was promised.

Every illusion mod has phantoms and puppets. Apocalypse + Ordinator, PerMa, Requiem, specific illusion mods, etcetcetc. Ordinator also has dream perks. Not sure if there is any kind of unmet demand there.

&gt; And why the restrictions? Daedra and undead, living creatures aren’t affected, yet mindless machines can be? Yes with perks all of these become manipulatable, but without a mind, a dwemer animunculus should be immune, no perks changing the. More lore friendly, and logical.

Bad idea. Now you can't make an illusion specialist because you can't do dwemer dungeons! Yay! (Of course you can't make an illusion specialist in vanilla because the perk is at level 100, but the point of a mod is to fix vanilla issues like this.) Also automatons do have a mind, which is why they include soul gems in their construction.

&gt; My version of illusion magic is also much more powerful, to make up for the inability to effect dwemer.

Game design mistake. You don't compensate for X being bad against A by making it overpowered against B. Not like illusion isn't already overpowered against humanoids in the first place.

&gt; You should be able to influence bartering, have people kill themselves, fight each other, drop their weapons to the ground, fall off a cliff, etc. Illusion should truly be able to be the magic responsible for killing emperors, as many lore books would tell you it can.

All of this exists in every perk/spell mod that includes illusion. It is standardised to the point of overlap. (It is also not lore friendly.)

&gt; Restoration: The manipulation of life, in all aspects, despite limitations. That is what the base game yields. And while doing a good job on adding more, modders have ignored those restrictions for the sake of variety between each other. Sorry but there shouldn’t be any bugs coming out of diseased and poisoned bodies. For there to be poisons or diseases, there has to be new life given to bacteria and organisms. And while restoration may be able to manipulate life in the base game, it couldn’t create new life in vanilla.

So how does restoration heal if it can't create new living tissue? Or, for that matter, if restoration can't create bacteria, it would be incapable of creating new gut flora, which even yoghurt can do according to the marketing.

Or technically the disease spells don't create life, they just manipulate life that already exists, namely the diseases you already have but that are suppressed by your immune system.

I agree that there should be no spiders coming out of bodies, mostly because this is a low level SkyRe spell that is apparently quite buggy and people keep sending *me* bug reports because they think it is an Apocalypse spell because they are too lazy to read a spell list and assume I am like The Duck That Does Not Test Anything.

In the end, the lore is built around a very limited set of spells in vanilla, not the other way round. Restoration can't create disease in vanilla because there are no Create Disease effects in vanilla because Damage Attribute already does that.

&gt; Thusly, there should be in restoration no disease or infesting magic, but pure death magic, the eradication of life, and healing magic, the enhancement of life. And between this building up and tearing down of life, is the bending of it, Blood Magic.

So like Apocalypse again?

&gt; Paralysis, lifting enemies and throwing them around, stealing their health, and stopping their hearts, all by changing how their blood flows.

Inflicting disease is not lore friendly but ""throwing around enemies"" is a perfectly valid restoration spell???

&gt; However, even though a restoration mage has the ability to control death, it can’t escape it. Being so close to constant killing aura would weaken any living being. Every known spell for death magic would decrease your max health by a bit, and slow health regen, though by little amounts. Around 5 points and 1% respectively.

Game design tip: you just created an environment where taking any spell other than the master level one is a noob trap. Why would you pick up Death Bolt at 25 skill and lose 5 points of health for a spell you won't use again after you pick up Death Storm at 100 skill, or just powerlevel (restoration is trivial to powerlevel) and buy only the latter?

&gt; Being an undead scion of the night takes away your life and soul, so death magic won't affect you. However, there is a downside. Holy magic, meant for killing undead, would have the same effect on you casting a holy spell as a mortal using death spells.

"d43b8wb","I stopped playing GTAOnline after the heists update came out. I said I would, and I did. Single player is fine for me, but online is hell. The hacking, the grinding required to get ANYTHING good and don't even mention how every god damn thing has a giant price tag for no good reason.

They want more money, and that's it. Maybe a few of the staff members there are actually aiming to make the game a bit more player friendly, but most are just riding along for the money.

I just don't get it... They made a game that makes fun of that kind of thing, and they go ahead and do it themselves...

Do you honestly think rockstar gives a shit about the playerbase?

The second place I went to was Firestone. They were professional and friendly, but didn't go nearly as far to explain the problem as the first one went. I would definitely go back to the independent place for the actual repair. The only reason I hesitated is that the repair was going to be around $2k, and the guy said that depending on the problem, it could potentially inflate to a much higher number if it was something bad.

 **The Man from the Fyrone Flats and the Runic Forge**

&gt;**The man from the ravaging lands**
  
&gt;
  
&gt;North of the Great Barrier stands most of Valoran's city-states, while most of what lies south of the Great Barrier is wasteland and wild places with occasional ruins from the past Rune Wars.
  
&gt;
  
&gt;http://i.imgur.com/ywIw6ce.jpg
  
&gt;
  
&gt;One of these places are the Fyrone Flats, a place with splitting earth, cracked and twisted landscape and strong earthquakes. No soul knows what civilization might've dwelled upon this land before, but rumors tell of a forge, which was used to make the runic armor and weapons for the magelords and protectorates alike, lies deep buried in the ruins of the fyrone wastelands.
  
&gt;Rumors which meant nothing to most of  the tribes and small communities who fight for survival everyday in these harsh lands.
  
&gt;A fight for survival that often lead to violent encounters. 
  
&gt;
  
&gt;One of these tribes are the Zuraferi . They are a tribe of skilled blacksmiths, strong warriors and craftsman. 
  
&gt;
  
&gt;Among the tribe was an extremely talented boy named Talos, he was very skilled in smithing and a more than capable warrior. Hard labor at the forge and fighting off hostile tribes and beasts with a massive hammer made him strong, but he has always been one of the more larger and stronger people of his tribe anyways.
  
&gt;Surprisingly, even though he had a body that seemed more fitting for brutish tasks, he was quite reflective and thoughtful. His fellow tribesman didn't think much of it, until he developed an obsession of the rumored runic forge somewhere in the Fyrone flats.
  
&gt;The fought of making weapons and armor in the legendary forge was too irresistible for him .
  
&gt;Talos collected any hints he could find about that forge, no matter how little or meaningless it was. He would travel even far out and even go as far as disguising himself as an enemy tribesman to infiltrate their camps and eavesdrop for information . It was a dangerous doing, he didn't infiltrate them for the sake of finding out any weakness to get an advantage to his tribe, but to gather more tales of the rune wars and the mythical forged. In one of these trips he wandered towards the borders of shurima, meeting a trading caravan.
  
&gt;
  
&gt;He asked them several question about the forge, they knew nothing but had an old book with that mythical story for trade. Talos didn't have any money, it wasn't necessary in the Fyrone flats, so he decided to trade parts of his armor for that book. Armor parts which he carefully made and adorned with artful markings, a truly fine piece and a rarity in this area . The traders accepted the deal without hesitation, the Zuraferi crafting was know in that lower small part of the southern lands, but that tribe didn't like to give or trade their armor to any outsider. He disregarded that fact though, thinking that his aim would be worth more than some armor parts, even if it is made by someone as skillful as him, he could always make new ones.
  
&gt;
  
&gt;Wearing an uncomplete armor and the old book ,muffled in old rags,  Talos returned home, unknowing what awaits him...
  
&gt;The high-ranking members of his tribe already grew wary of him and tasked one of the more stealthy warriors, Valo, to keep an eye on him. On one day he saw Talos enter the stronghold of an hostile tribe. At first the Valo thought that Talos would sabotage the enemy tribes, but he Talos left as peacefully as he entered. Valo had to report it to the high-ranking members of the tribe and the chieftain.
  
&gt;
  
&gt;The Zuraferi took notes of his rebellious behaviour, they told him to stop his unrelenting search for a forge, which according to them didn,t exist. But [..], ignored their warning, he worked too hard for it to just give up. And so it was not long until this dissension reached it's climax.
  
&gt;
  
&gt;When Talos came back at one night from his trips, high-ranking members of his tribe and the chieftain named Hakas ,one of the few man bigger than Talos and also taking the position of a shaman within his tribe,  already waited for him. Talos was worried,but thought what he did was right, he was aware that his people didn't like his recent behaviour. But instead of showing his concern, Talos put on a stoic expression. Whatever they were about to told him, he was already willing to accept it, it was already set in his mind what his priority is.
  
&gt;
  
&gt;Talos's confident and powerful stride became slower and calm. Even though he is very strong, he respects his elders and would never turn against his family. He stopped in front of them.
  
&gt;
  
&gt;""What happend to your armor?"" - asked Hakas.
  
&gt;
  
&gt;Talos hesitated for a moment.
  
&gt;
  
&gt;""I gave it in exchange for something more valuable to me..."" - he replied, while holding the old book in front of him.
  
&gt;The chieftain let that sink in for a moment, before flicking his fingers like a command.
  
&gt;Two warriors stepped forth, holding between them a bloodied and beaten enemy man of a tribe Talos infiltrated. 
  
&gt;
  
&gt;Hakas exhaled.
  
&gt;
  
&gt;""We already know of your relentless pursuit for this... myth"" 
  
&gt;""You are wasting your time , make your people worry, if it's about smithing or combat training, you listen, but whenever the topic changes to that forge, you become so stubborn, it breaks my heart to see such a fine smith and warrior take such an unhonorful path."" - Hakas said before turning to the captured tribesman.
  
&gt;
  
&gt;The warriors stepped aside and the chieftrain wraped his powerful grip on the neck of his prisoner and lifted him up.
  
&gt;
  
&gt;""Three sunsets ago we fought a rivaling tribe, they were more aggressive towards us than usually ,this time though, we invaded their tribe, broke their bones with hammers and split their heads with axes. Leaving only him alive..., we asked him why their tribe became more aggressive. At first he didn't want to answer, but that was easily fixable after breaking few of his rips .""
  
&gt;Hakas had a angered facial expression while saying that to Talos, he was clearly displeased.
  
&gt;""He saw one of ours, he saw a Zuraferi putting down a wretched disguise, before walking towards our stronghold."" - his gaze fell upon the enemy tribesman and held him with his face towards Talos.
  
&gt;""WAS IT HIM?"" - Hakas furiously asked.
  
&gt;
  
&gt;The injured tribesman grunted with pain before looking at Talos.
  
&gt;
  
&gt;""Ye..Yes..that is the Zuraferi i saw.. , i swear"" - he said followed by coughing up blood.
  
&gt;
  
&gt;""Please.. i told you what you wanted to know, have mer-"" - Hakas snapped his neck before he could finish his plead and tossed his lifeless body aside.
  
&gt;
  
&gt;Even though the Zuraferi were a tribe with a lot of blacksmiths and craftsman, they held a fierce reputation within the fyrone flats. They are strong and brutal when it comes down to it and merciless in battle. Otherwise they behave peacful and friendly, but only when treated with respect and fairness.
  
&gt;Talos realized that lies were of no use, so he decided to tell Hakas the honest truth.
  
&gt;
  
&gt;""It is true i infilrated many enemy tribes to get intel out of them..., i needed information, information important to me. I pursuit my aims with an iron determination as it should be and that is why i did it"" - Talos finally replied.
  
&gt;""I met many people, i heared a lot about the world outside the Fyrone flats and about the Rune wars that took place in the past. If infiltrating enemies or walking long distances to get even a little bit information that brings me closer to my goal, then so be it! The Runic Forge exists and i will find it! 
  
&gt;
  
&gt;""The Rune wars scorched and tore asunder these lands, it rendered the Fyrone flats as a wasteland, the magic that was unleashed in that ancient event was too dangerous and it should stay in the past. We will leave the Fyrone flats behind ""- said Valo as he appeared among the high-ranking members of his tribe.
  
&gt;""But why so suddenly?"" - Talos asked.
  
&gt;""The tribe grows tired of the Fyrone flats and of you Talos, there has always been hostility between most tribes, but your behaviour gave us an unpleasant reputation and forced them to become more aggressive.Furthermore storms and earthquakes keep haunting these dangerous lands, lately they have even become stronger. The Fyronian flats are doomed and thus i've decided that the Zuraferi will relocate their stronghold in the shuriman desert."" - the chieftain answered with a confident and strong tone.
  
&gt;
  
&gt;""We will set out tomorrow morning, you will come too, the farther you are away from the ruins of the rune wars the better."" 
  
&gt;
  
&gt;""I wont go anywhere"" - Talos said with a cold tone.
  
&gt;
  
&gt;""Not before i found the runic forge""
  
&gt;""So be it, stay and try to find your beloved forge."" - said the chieftain indifferently at last and stepped in front of Talos, he grabbed his wrists and put an object in his hand before going to his tent.
  
&gt;
  
&gt;Talos was shocked,what has been given to him, is a vial which was only given to traitors or exiled who were being sent to the wasteland alone and without food. Nobody was really forced to drink the poison within, but the vial became a clear and silent message, a gesture that the presence of one isn't desired anymore. 
  
&gt;
  
&gt;After the high-ranking members were gone, Valo stepped towards him and put a hand on his shoulder. He was one of the few more friendly acquaintances Talos had.
  
&gt;
  
&gt;""Im sorry forgebrother, i had to do it. The chieftain became unsettling and i have to follow his orders, at least as long as he remains leader."" - Valo said .

Fun:

* Swimming at Bondi is always pretty awesome, as well as a ferry ride up to Manley beach.

* Maritime Museum is quite fun.  You can go into a submarine and on a bunch of other boats as well.  Not a big boat guy but still had a great time.

* In Sydney, it's worth trying to catch a Rugby game if someone's playing.  Last time I visited we went to the former Olympic stadium and watched the Roosters play Rabbitoh.  Great fun.  

* If you can get out there, the ""Featherdale Wildlife Park"" is awesome.  Wallabies are free to roam around and will come up to you for treats and petting while you check out other animals.  It's often included in a Blue Mountain tour, but 48 hours is pretty short so you may not want to waste a day on it.

* We went to a concert at the Sydney Opera House while we were there (Brian Wilson performing ""Pet Sounds"" for it's 50th anniversary, amazing show).  If there is a band playing there you are into, it could be worth getting tickets just for the experience of having seen a concert in one of the most iconic international landmarks in the world. And the architecture inside is really awesome.

* Sydney Zoo.  It's fun, not mind-blowing, but a good time.

Food:

* If you like Malaysian, [Mamak](http://www.yelp.com/biz/mamak-sydney-2?osq=mamak) in downtown Sydney is awesome and affordable.

* If you like Chinese dumplings, [Din Tai Fung](http://www.yelp.com/biz/din-tai-fung-sydney-5?osq=dumpling) was recommended by several locals as being the best dumplings, and they were pretty damn awesome.

* If you like Moroccan, the shaksuka @ [Cafe Mint](http://www.yelp.com/biz/cafe-mint-surry-hills?osq=middle+eastern+food) in Surrey Hills is one of my favorite in the world.  I've eaten there 5 times, and when they are on it's really, really on.

* A bit pricier, but [Spice Temple](http://www.yelp.com/biz/spice-temple-sydney) makes some really fancy asian dishes that are delicious.  The ""Hot Numbing Wagyu Beef"" was an experience.

* If you go to Bondi, do yourself a favor and stop by [Bondi Massive](http://www.yelp.com/biz/bondi-massive-bondi-beach), who has, according to my GF, the best avocado toast in Australia (given a limited sample size of Sydney and Melbourne).  In this we agree, though, and you have a view of the beach which is a great way to have breakfast.  I ran into a girl here on my first trip who proceeded to tell me she was a professional aura reader.

Drinks:

* For drinks downtown, I highly recommend going to [Papa Gedes](http://www.yelp.com/biz/papa-gedes-bar-sydney).  It's an awesome tiki-style bar down a back alley, and the owners are super nice and usually hanging out in the bar trying to be friendly.

* A little bit less friendly, but solid drinks and a totally bizarre atmosphere, is [Shady Pines Saloon](http://www.yelp.com/biz/shady-pines-saloon-darlinghurst).  Just a heads up, the door is down the side street, painted white, and basically unmarked.",1465057093,"* a little bit less friendly, but solid drinks and a totally bizarre atmosphere, is [shady pines saloon](http://www.yelp.com/biz/shady-pines-saloon-darlinghurst).","friendly, but solid","friendly","but",TRUE,"less friendly , but solid","solid","less",NA,1

"d3b7k97","It would be a cross between fate/Zero, Hitman, Lovesick: Yandere Simulator, Battle Royale, Danganronpa: Another Episode, Undertale and Jojo's Bizarre Adventures. It sounds like an odd bunch, but hear me out.

It would probably be an RPG.

In this game, 5% of earth's population has the ability to summon ""Guardians"". Guardians are like Stands, culminations of your psychological energy. However, they have their own free will, and have memories of their past life (like in Fate/zero). Also, the weaker you are, the stronger the Guardian is. So if you're really thin,sick, and tired often your guardian would be like, Iskander from Fate/Zero or something. 

The protagonist is one of this 5%, who attends Bridger Forest High School. His guardian is a knight.

Now, 10 people pose a threat to the protagonist, and this protagonist must find a way to stay alive until graduation. He has 10 weeks.

Like in Yandere sim, there are several ways to murder them, and each one has a unique killing method to themselves only. You can be completely peaceful or completely murderous. The game can get really dark.

Out of these 10 people:

* 2 are club presidents: One is the Robotics Club President, one is the Smash Club President. Both have a grudge on you concerning past events. You could murder them both, stage an accident, or befriend them and let sleeping dogs lie....

* 1 is an important member of a council: The student council. The discovery of his body can severely impact the rest of game play, as he is an extremely likable person. He simply does not like you because of your Guardian status.

* 1 is the protagonist's best friend. He is very shy, introverted and friendly, but he has suicidal tendencies and depression,  which can make him hard to kill by players, since he's rather cinnamon-rolly. Also, he is the resident DJ, and often performs on stage during performances/talent shows. He becomes paranoid that you will use your Guardian against him. You could drop a stagelight on him, mess with his equipment or have a tear-felt scene on the roof where he almost tendencies himself off.

* 1 is a girl. She can be matchmade with someone else....or you could seduce her. Have fun, though, she's hostile, but easy to manage if you play the cards right. 

* 1 is extremely popular and surrounds themselves with friends, so eliminating him will be difficult. He is bent on making your life hell. You could turn all his friends against him, or have him expelled. 

* One is a delinquent. You could drive him to suicide by killing all his friends, or you could get on his good side. You could also stage events to convince him to become a good student.

* One is a Guardian user himself. His guardian is a WW2 soldier. He thinks that there can only be one Guardian user on campus....and it's him. He's a member of the Orchestra as well, so you could crush him with an instrument, kidnap his friend and torture said into killing him or rig something to crush him during a performance.

* One is a coach for the swim team. He dissapproves of Guardians. You could drown him, or matchmake him with a former student/love interest of his....

* One is actually a psychopath, and extremely difficult to defeat. 

Socializing has several different options: like in Lovesick: Yandere Simulator, you can compliment people to increase your reputation. You can also make ""small talk"" or ""gossip"". 

The ""true"" pacifist run goes like this:

* Robotics Club President is befriended.

* Student Council Secratary is ""saved"" in a staged event

* Best friend is calmed down on the rooftop.

* Girl is matchmade- with you.

* Smash Club President is reunited with his former best friend.

* Popular student is convinced by his friends that you are a good person.

* Delinquent is set up to be good

* Guardian user is battled on the rooftop. The two make up (as no one had been found dead)

* Coach is matchmade with alumni (5 possible choices)

* The psychopath is surrounded by the protagonist's friends. At this point, no one is harmed here, so it's a 8 v 1 style thing. Psychopath gives in. All is well.

Bridger Forest has plenty of clubs to join, as well as a jostling school enviroment. Bridger Forest also has school uniforms based on Japanese and English school uniforms. Different clubs can unlock different cutscenes and advantages, including one where the protagonist's best friend is slashed in the chest. While holding his chest, the protagonist shoots the best friend with a bow from the Archery Club. The arrow goes right through his chest and hand, killing him.

It turns out that the knight is testing the protagonist to see if he is worthy of wielding his power. If he is (Pacifist) then he will stay. If he is not (Neutral) then he leaves. If he has done a genocide route, the knight will kill the protagonist.

Battles will mostly be like in Danganronpa: Another Episode where you can switch to the guardian, but only for a limited time.

"d3b7bpx","I just bought the samsung smartcam hd pro from costco and it came with 16gb memory card. At 1080p, that's about an hour or so of footage? Just a guess. You can upgrade to 120gb microsd. I think it cost about $130? &lt;--- for the package from costco, not the 120gb microsd.  Lengthy review of this camera! 



Features:It does provide 1080p and 720p, and you can view it LIVE using your Android or Apple phone (sorry windows phone). It can also be viewed from a laptop or computer that has downloaded the plugin! So if you have a computer available wherever you're going, you can check in. It has good low light and even night vision. Also a 2 way speaker system (think walkie talkie using your cell phone and the camera), and the viewing angle is huge! We have a semi open floor plan, I can see the hallway/backdoor/kitchen/dining room/living room [basically middle of the house]. A lot of IP camera's out there boast quick and easy set up, but they take awhile, hard to use, and arn't exactly what you were thinking of. This thing basically did it all for me. Some companies even charge a subscription for uploading footage to cloud/viewing footage online/over the phone. (by the way, this camera doesn't upload footage to cloud at all). The thing that I like about this camera is that, you can set an alarm. I have it set so that any movement/audio in the house while I'm out is recorded and will notify my phone within a minute that there's movement. 

This is useful for me, because I'm using it while I'm out of town to know if there are home intruders. In your case, it'll save you time because it'll let you know when someone's in the room or at home. Then you can simply go on your phone/computer and watch or listen in and see what they're talking about to your daughter.

It does automatically record 30 second intervals or movement/audio, although it's not perfect... I tested it at home, I walked into the room and hung out in there for about 5 minutes. It did notify me within a minute, but it only recorded about a minute worth of footage. It then recorded another minute worth of footage about 3-5 minutes later. So it's not CONTINUOUSLY recording automatically. However, I do have the option of manually recording as much footage as I want. 

Here's a basic example.

Someone breaks into my house and walks through the view of the camera OR breaks a window and makes noise. Camera starts recording for 30 second intervals for a minute or two. Also notifies me via push notification within a minute (as long as I have internet connection on my phone). 

Then, I can view the camera using my phone/computer, I can even record footage in directly to my phone, or to the SD card (30 second intervals) but as much as I want. You can also ZOOM in on the image/footage while it's LIVE, (maybe try to identify who it is?), you can also ""screenshot"" take a picture using the included app.

Next I can tell the intruders via 2 way speaker that the cops or coming, or just continue watching.

One more thing I forgot to mention, usually camera's (probably due to privacy) have LED notification lights on them. Look at a webcam/computer speakers/ or even your phone. While it is on or recording, there's a big glaring BLUE or RED or GREEN LED light, which is easily noticeable. Bad because intruders may notice this and break/steal/throw it away asap. In your case, family members may face the camera into the wall or unplug it. This camera, allows you to turn off that notification light.

I know you're looking for something inexpensive. I've tried other camera's for $50-$80 and nothing really matches up to this. I've also tried other camera's in the $300 range, and it's about the same but I much rather prefer this. I'd suggest buying it from Costco with their 90 day return policy since you only want to use it for a short period of time. This might be ethically wrong and is up to you..., but I believe once you try it you'll appreciate it so much more and keep it. Peace of mind while you're at work, on vacations, and so much more. 


CONS: 

1. Doesn't have the option to upload to cloud. Basically, if someone breaks it/steals it/takes your sd card. You got nothing... [BUT if you manually recorded to your phone by watching live after being notified of motion/audio, you have whatever footage before they break/stole/unplugged the camera]

2. The footage is unprotected! Meaning if you take the microsd card out and plug it into your phone/computer, it'll read it and you can watch the footage. So if your family took the sd and put it in the computer, they can selectively delete footage. If a intruder stole your camera, they can watch everything that was recorded in your house. On the bright side of things.. it makes it easier for you to watch the footage/upload to youtube or wherever. User friendly, but unprotected data. Other security camera's have protection where you can only view the footage while it is plugged into the camera, or through a special application designed for the file format. (It gets really annoying dealing with these camera's).

Really, these cons are most likely due to either make your life easier and/or budget and save money for the consumer.

Likely, she is jealous of the friendship he has with the group and sees it as a threat to his relationship with her.  You want her to be part of the group, but not because you like her.

Normally, I'd suggest just talking to her, but this has been 2 years in the making, and without any genuinely friendly feelings, that will most likely blow up.

http://making.duolingo.com/images/mpl_fig2_lang2.png



Must be said Duolingo is very limited in number of languages you can learn there and also in which countries it is popular and how many people use it - so whole world is not actually good example, because obviously in some countries it might be chosen by literally few people that clicked on something and tried something.

To languages how i said only few are so far in Duolingo´s offer/basically western languages/.

In virtually every country is English most popular foreign language with few exceptions, so based on this in most countries is English No.1 on Duolingo, howewer countries that are very good in English and have good education system/obviosly people there don´t need Duolingo.

Example of this are Scandinavia countries, no need for them to try Duolingo for English, instead Spanish is nice example - 2nd most studed language by pupils in Sweden and Norway - also more studied now than German in Iceland/but they have No.2 Danish.

In Sweden how explained in article - Swedish is option for foreigners- otherwise it would be Spanish - like based on map of No.2 languages - link i posted

Balkan - German is mostly 2nd most popular/studied language after English/Romania being only exception/ - how i said everyone learns English in school this days so they try German maybe in free time.

Iran and Pakistan are surprising that English is not most studied.

Nambia is also shocking - German was formerly official language i think untl 1990 and it´s former German colony, but only few whites speak it and i doubt there are strong economic ties to GErmany so not sure why they learn German, English should be No.1 clearly and Portuguese/French shoul be more interesting with French and Portuguse speaking AFrica among neighbours.

Rest of Africa makes sense - everyone learns English, except counties with English as official language and British heritage probably have English in schools so they learn French in their free time.

In Southeast ASia Spanish makes not much sense except Phillipines but even there Spanish is almost non-existent this days and from what i know Mandarin and Japanese are No.2 and No.3 afterEnglish in most countries in region/but how i said Duolingo´s offer is limited if there would be proper Mandarin and Japanese courses than those languages would be more visibly in ASEAN countries.

Australia/NZ - logical English speaking countries try most popular western languages which are French and Spanish.

2nd most popular languages - link i posted

Most of countries makes sense - Argentina has Italian - obviously Argentina is with strong Italian heritage so why not.

Few of Brazilian neigbhours have for obvious reasons Portuguese.

Brazil itself lgically Spanish and rest of South America - French - mostly logical choices

Europe is also mostly logical - except Poland not sure why Spanish is more populat than German on Duolingo/i asume much more people have German in school so they try another language

Dutch in Denmark makes no sense - i know Netherlands and Denmark are somehow close and friendly but honesly why would Danns learn Dutch language?:D

Rest of Europe - German, Spanish, Italian - mostly logical choices. Mostly it makes sense - German after English most popular so also most studied, obviously Romaia has French as bigger language, but probably they don´t need Duolingo for it when they have it in school so they try German instead, similar Croatia - English not studied on Duolingo, German as No.1 and Italian as No.2/whichis No.3 foreign language there.

Africa- interesting that German is No.2 and not French in Egypt, but especially Tunisia. English speaking Africa learns Spanish - so it looks like they don ´t need Duolingo for English - it´s all French and Spanish onDuolingo there.

Angola and Mozambique - obviously Portuguese - those countries are Portuguese speaking but not majority of population so they try also this way.

ASia- mostly logical, Iran - well French and German more populat than English on Duolingo - interesting

Indonesia- having German over French or Spanish is also surprising i think.

(Should I intervene?)

... 
*phew* (They sorted it out without intervention.)

But yeah, the internet is a place where arguments can arise from small things for multitude of reasons:

Its so much easier to say something mean to a person over a screen, because there's less consequence. 

Since the internet connects people from all across the world with different cultures, standards and etiquette, some people are offended by things much more than the other person intended. 

And there's more, but I just realised that I started giving a really out of place and dumb speech here, so I'm gonna cut it short and summarize that you've gotta be both careful and tolerant on the internet, because its so much easier to get into a row with a random stranger. It happens to everyone. 

But hey, I'm glad you resolved the argument. I've been in communities that have been torn apart by less, I was once myself a part of a trove club, wherethe club was do nice, friendly, creative and progressive that Trove went from a game I downloaded on steam randomly and expected to play for a couple hours and never touch again to a game I'd play for hours a day. Until the club began to fall apart. The leader left for college and me and two other Officers were made leaders and left in charge. But we began to disagree over things, I believed in making the club inclusive and friendly, but the other guy wanted to keep the club tight, letting in only those we really trusted, and only giving build permissions to a small amount of people. And the third one seemed to never be on when everyone else was on, and did practically nothing. And then there were dissensions within the Architects and Officers. One person had a massive problem with another person, both gave totally different accounts of the event that had transpired that drove them apart, but both were really good members of the club, who had contributed a lot and been kind to everyone (Though one had built a really ugly cinema that only the other Leader had the lack of tact to say it was awful). I couldn't think of either of them lying, but evidently one of them had. In the end one of them left, and the other one hardly ever logged on. In the end it culminated in someone going and destroying my underground lab I had built, and the other Leader leaving, and me just losing the will to play the game anymore. Our great community had fell apart. From a couple silly rows.

"d2pgfjf","I'm bisexual. I'm out and proud about it. My parents, siblings, boyfriend, friends, even professors know about it! I've done research on heteronormativity and changing attitudes towards sexuality and gender. I'm an activist and heavily involved in volunteer groups and organizations for gay teenagers. Most of my coworkers know that I'm gay and involved. FFS, I even won a scholarship award for my work in the local gay community. 

Despite ALL of this, I have not directly discussed it with any of upper management. The director and assistant director of my department do not know (at least not from me, anyways!) and my manager person has not directly been told by me. If any of them know, I don't care, but it is not something I would ever feel comfortable talking about with them, unless I was experiencing some kind of workplace harassment. That's the only time I would bring it up.

The problem I'm seeing here is that your fiancee does not recognize the fundamental differences between the two workplaces. It's not relevant in your job, or you are not comfortable presenting your sexuality at your workplace. Your fears about being fired or losing out on promotions are not unwarranted. Your fiancee is so so lucky to work somewhere with a boss that is not only supportive and LGBTQ+ friendly, but bisexual as well! I wish I could be more gay at work. I wish it were acceptable, but in many workplaces, heteronormativity is expected. Not only is it expected, but enforced. Many times it's even subconscious - your caliber of person is questioned at a level where they aren't even consciously thinking ""/u/inclosetatwork is an immoral person because she is not straight, we should not give her a promotion,"" rather they're skipping over you completely just because they feel like you don't deserve it. 

These fears are very valid, and it's crazy to me that your fiancee doesn't understand that, especially since she is also a lesbian. Has she never really dealt with discrimination before? Or has she always been so lucky?

But I'd also like to mention that her fears are valid. She wants you to validate your relationship in the professional environment, because she sees that as an important part of your relationship. My bf is an immigrant, but I don't tell everyone that because it would make him uncomfortable. But that is an important part of our identity as a couple. Your sexuality is an important part of your identity as an individual and as a couple. She feels hidden and unimportant, even though it is only at work and no where else. These feelings are also very valid. No one likes feeling insecure, and she's probably of the opinion that if your workplace doesn't support you, you should move on. 

Ultimately, you guys might consider counseling. I think this is an issue you two can easily work around once you completely understand each other, because right now it sounds like your voices and feelings are being drowned out by the fears and insecurities of the other. A counselor may provide solid ground for this type of conversation. It's also regularly suggested here to pursue some kind of counseling before getting married, just to settle things and make sure you're on the same page. 

I don't think this is ultimatum worthy, but if she does, there's likely something deeper going on. Work at it and talk about it. You don't get anywhere if you don't communicate.

"d2pfh61","Owen is almost a year old, he is the most friendly, affectionate cat I've ever met, I really don't know what I'd do without him.  I got him from a shelter last fall, and when I got there, there were 4 other kittens.  They all immediately, came and attacked my shoe laces, except for Owen who proceeded to climb up my leg and onto my shoulder, at which point he nudged against my neck and went to sleep.  He definitely chose me and not the other way around.

However the story on how I came about getting Owen isn't all smiles.  My previous cat kit-kat had suddenly died a month before.  Kit-kat was only about a year and a half old and one night we were in bed, and he suddenly jumped out of the bed, gagged like he was going to throw up, and laid down and stopped breathing.  It was devastating.  Other than gold-fish as a kid, kit-kat was my first real pet, and he was my buddy.  He was very nice and friendly, but enjoyed being by himself more and was a little skiddish, whereas Owen doesn't like being more than 10 feet away from me.  The vet said it is likely Kit-Kat had an enlarged heart or something like that, something kittens can suffer from.

[Here](http://i.imgur.com/nopYaPt.jpg) is a photo of Kit-kat, my buddy.  I know him and Owen would have been good friends.

EDIT: BTW Thought you guys might get a kick out of why I named him Owen.  He is named after Danny Devito's character from Throw Mama Off the Train.  Anne Ramseys character was always calling Owen a pain in the ass and saying he is trying to kill her.  Well when Owen was a little kitten he was always by my feet when I was walking around and trying to scare and jump attack me.  He tripped me several times and I would always yell, ""He's trying to kill me!"" so it seemed natural.",1462177821,"he was very nice and friendly, but enjoyed being by himself more and was a little skiddish, whereas owen doesn't like being more than 10 feet away from me.","nice and friendly","friendly",NA,FALSE,"very nice and friendly","nice",NA,"very",0

If you think of it from the company standpoint, always-online verification is not very user friendly, but most gamers have a connection and it's an easy way to throw a dragnet.  

My issue is that it pushes aside the well-being of legitimate customers, which is usually the vast majority of the player base in a game.  

But when everyone's using it, and you do want to play the game, it's hard for gaming consumers to really punish the companies.

- 'club culinario toscano da osvaldo' - incredible selection of food, all really rustic home style cooking. No newly invented dishes, they just cook old italian food really bloody well. Everything is crazy delicious and rich and buttery and i want to go back... Also go for the local farm house wine served by the quarter or half litre. 

- 'Vini E Vecchi Sappori' - tiny place, so booking in advance is a necessity (as with everywhere in Florence really). Again leave lots of room for all the food you're going to eat. The staff are great, really funny and friendly but not trying to take over your meal. Definitely recommend the Osso Bucco when you get to the second course. It's perfect.

In the day it was lots of sandwiches. We didn't go to the really famous ones (i dont think anyway, there were never any tourists when we ate anywhere) Again the 2 best we had were:

- A sandwich shop on Via Giuseppe Verdi that I can't remember the name of.v Really busy at lunch times and run by some young friends who seem to constantly be running around and working hard. Loads of selection of fillings, create your own or get one the pre-concocted sandwiches. You can't really go wrong. I can't work out how to save a location that isn't named on google maps so it's very close to La Maremma if you just search for that.

- '43°46'14.1""N 11°15'19.8""E' &lt; that's the coordinates. A tiny hole in the wall takeaway sandwich shop. I'd always pop in for a quick snack in the day as it's very central.

It was day time. Around 3 pm and I was having a barbecue with some friends and we were at an old school house that the person throwing the barbecue lived at. I don't remember the guys name, but he was very weird, friendly but creepy.

The guy invited us to go to the roof of his old school house. We agreed that that would be fun so me and my 8 friends went up there. Within a few seconds of everyone making their way onto the roof somebody points to the sky and says... ""Whoa whats that?""

We all look up and see a ball of light like a sun just still in the air and it was against a blue sky on a sunny day. It was smaller than the moon but much bigger than a star. Then out of the blue literally one ship and then another ""pop"" into the sky. It was as if 7 alien spaceships took their invisibility cloak off all at once.

Suddenly the eight lights started moving around the sky all weird and then my memory goes a little blank and then they were gone, but I don't have a memory of them flying off, which is weird because I never took my eyes off of them even for a second so how could I not remember them flying off?

"d1wq58i","0) You're not high ranked in team league and quick match. You're around average. I suggest you accept that when thinking of what heroes you're going to play well. So look at what players at silver play to win the most. Also, hero league seems more competitive to me, so perhaps honestly you'll do worse in HL than in other formats. That's just where the strongest competition is.

1) You have experience but you may be falling into traps with your playstyle. Perhaps you need to see how better players do things in order to learn something new that you may be missing. You seem to like a passive reactionary playstyle rather than a proactive one. Maybe that works better when you have someone telling you what to do and expect, but not so much when you're on your own. You don't want to be passive when you should be carrying, you have to make plays happen, not just sit back and plug away hoping someone else makes something happen.

2) Don't play support so much. Support is only as effective as your other team mates. If you're a better player don't play support unless you can pick a hybrid, you're stuck as last pick, or you believe someone is good enough to trust in.

3) Play someone strong, someone you're good at, someone that can get things done. Acknowledge the meta for your level in how your opponents and team will preform. Suggest meta picks for them at their level. 

4) Play aggressive, get pick offs. Other teams will have weak players. If you can keep them out of team fights your team will have an advantage.

5) Lead your team, but also be willing to follow. Help your team, to help you, to help them, win.

6) Deal with people in a friendly but influential way. Even if you disagree and they insult you, sometimes you have to endure an insult as long as they're willing to work with you now that they feel that they ""got you"". Sometimes you have to play peacemaker and tell two knuckle-heads to play together and beat up the enemy instead. Sometimes you have to inspire team mates to try something clever rather than giving up.

"d1bpvjt","&gt;And when feminine conversation tends to be ALL ABOUT subtle social cues (why did Jess insult my lipstick when I told her I liked her new hair color? Why does Karina edge away when I compliment her shoes? Why, after all that, is Bec happy that I think her top is cute? I'm just being honest and trying to be kind and friendly, but apparently I'm not doing it right),

Well, my point is that it's really not a good look to generalize the majority of female friendship/conversation as being about makeup/shoes/clothes, with the often unstated implication being that other girls are shallow. (FTR, I don't think there's anything wrong with being into these things; but there's often a level of sexist generalization that goes on in denigrating stereotypical feminine hobbies. As another redditor said, it's very ""cool girl"" ish.) I said in my earlier comment that my best friend is a super girly girl and our friendship does not consist of talking about makeup or clothes. And it did not consist of talking about makeup and clothes even when we were mere acquaintances, either. IDGAF about makeup or fashion so trust me, if being friends with girls required complimenting other women's makeup, I'd be SOL. 

I'm awkward af, too. A lot of social cues are beyond me, and I'm particularly terrible at reading body language. I'm pretty sure I've unintentionally insulted a lot of people - guys AND girls - because my own body language can be off-putting (e.g. I have difficulty keeping eye contact and I turn away from people a lot without realizing I'm doing it, which I've been told makes people feel dismissed/ignored. I'm working on that.) And yet... girls don't give me *more* trouble than guys.

The whole ""I don't get on super well with other girls""/""I can't deal with girls who don't get on with girls"" thing is quite possibly tied in with the whole ""girls not getting diagnosed when they have autism"" thing. As a woman who still doesn't grasp all the nuances of female conversation, it's not for lack of trying. The whole concept is damned difficult. In terms of compliments, for example, I've just taken to giving one sincere compliment per conversation with female acquaintances. It's not really working, but I can't see any other avenues.

"d0y2m8x","As a Korean-American let me start by just saying that the first and easiest step to improving your instant ramen experience is simply to buy better instant ramen. Brands like Nissin and Maruchan that sell well in the U.S. honestly just don't compare. I know I know it's cheap as fuck but better quality ramen isn't THAT expensive.

Koreans have a long history of instant ramen (you might find it labeled as ""ramyun"" which is how Koreans pronounce ramen) and I've already seen some of the more popular brands in American grocery stores like NongShim stuff especially ""Shin Ramyun"" which is arguably the most popular (a warning though, this brand is notorious for being on the spicier side). You'll often find it in ethnic sections. Just about anything NongShim makes is pretty good but some people find the seafood flavors off putting.

I know that not everyone has access to this or Korean/Japanese/Asian markets but for those of you willing to go the extra mile, Amazon does sell this brand. For regular ramyun that you need a small pot for, the size per pack is significantly larger than Nissin/Maruchan and you can find them in bulk boxes for less than a dollar per pack. They also have cup ramen versions of Shin Ramyun. 

Tips on the regular ramyun: add an egg or two and some veggies. Scallions, mushrooms, and just about anything thinly sliced in moderation make great additions. But try the egg forsure, just crack the egg into the pot after you've added the noodles and flavor packet. It's a classic add-on and if you do it right will give you a wonderfully poached egg while the extra bits of egg mix in with the broth to give your ramyun more ""body"". 

For both the regular and just about any spicy Korean cup ramyun there's a more interesting tip that almost always goes over well no matter how weird it sounds. After you've fully cooked your ramyun of choice, add a single slice of cheese. The Kraft singles kind, nothing fancy. This kind of cheese tends to mix rather than just melt and clump. Leave it on top of your ramen until it gets all melty and then mix until the cheese has fully incorporated into the broth. Trust, it's amazing. It's like cheesy Korean pasta.

Now if you have access to a Korean/Japanese market just explore honestly. Your options become endless and Asian people have done well in perfecting instant ramen over the years. For Japanese ramen enthusiasts, I have found on multiple occasions, tokotsu (pork bone broth) ramen in cup form and the ones I've tried are mostly bomb. They nail that thick creamy broth and it's amazing and worth the extra you'll pay.

If you only have access to the popular brands sold in the US now, you can't really do much to the cup ramen versions. The regular kind you can really mess with if you have to. Things I've tried that have worked really well, veggies of all kinds work really well as long as they're sauteed properly. I especially like bamboo shoots in mine, you can find them at some grocery stores in a can. These actually don't need a whole lot of cooking so add them toward the end of your cooking process. Other things that improve flavor, sesame oil (use sparingly!! sesame oil is very strong flavor-wise), chili oils, dashes of  soy sauce to taste, chili flakes. The more simple the flavor you choose, the more freedom you have to work with. The ""Oriental"" flavor made by Nissin is kinda like a really simple Soy Sauce/Shoyu broth Ramen and has a lot of potential. 
Fun Fact: this is also one of VERY few ramen flavors/brands that is vegetarian friendly, but for those of you who are Vegetarian/Vegan, NongShim actually recently released a line called ""Soon Noodle Soup - Veggie"" that is Vegan friendly and pretty tasty.

The young lawyer brought a yellow legal pad, and a pen to the meeting.  As they started, she wrote all of the grievances down, and asked periodic questions of the [evil]stepmother to make sure that everything was accurately written down.  

She also wrote down the feelings expressed by her and her husband.  Basically, she took notes on the whole meeting, and made sure that everything written down was deemed to be correct by those attending.

She then wrote everything down that everyone was going to do going forward to improve relationships, and read it back to everyone to make sure that there were no misunderstandings.  I can't remember whether people also signed the thing at the end or not.

"d06rsj5","This is really pethetic but; my first ""relationship"" (quasi-relationship?) experience was in summer 2008 when I was 15 yrs old and pretending to be a guy on an online game where I got 'close' to people and used to also used to spend hours chatting them to them on MSN and I had a ""girlfriend"" for 2 months, she lived in America and me in the UK, and she obviously believed I was a guy and stuff.

The whole thing was obviously not real based purely on the fact I misrepresented myself (yes I was a catfish and no i'm not proud of it), but the *feelings* were real and very intense. I'm actually straight and only attracted to guys, but I loved this girl so much. 
I spent hours talking to her, even into the late nights. I would think of her all day in school and the first thing I'd do every morning was look at her guestbook posts, etc. She ""left me"" for 'another' guy (also online lol, but I think that one progressed to a real life one where they met in person and stuff though i'm not sure), though, and I remember the furious jealousy and hatred I had for him and it kind of became a love triangle that went on for months.

My first ""real life"" crush was intense as well, later that year I developed one on a guy in my GCSE history class. I never even spoke to him properly in person and was confused at my feelings for him at first, I became obsessed with him. Ah I used to facebook/myspace stalk him. I knew deep down nothing would come out of it, I could never approach him because he had a well established social circle in school and some of those people didn't like me, so I was never gonna 'penetrate' that but I'd deluded myself somehow into thinking by adding him on MSN and talking to him on there, something would progress from there. He would chat to me, but it was all very superficial stuff. When it became obvious nothing would happen I made a last ditch effort and confessed my feelings on MSN, he was nice about it, just said something along the lines of ""no offence but i don't really know you, we never speak in person, etc"" which was a nice rejection. Or so I thought, I learned a year later from a friend who was in his A level biology class that they were talking about 'weirdos' in school they knew and I was named as one, I'd speak to him on MSN but never in person and that I ""disgusted"" him apparently. 

Since then I haven't had any intense crushes or many crushes at all really. I see guys I'm attracted to but I don't see it as worth investing emotional energy into. There was one crush where I boldly approached him in person and we kinda became friends for a while over text and hung out twice (I wouldn't count them as 'dates') but I lost interest in him, I found him cute and friendly but we had absolutely nothing in common apart from the fact we went to the same school (I approached him in community college, which we were both going to) and it was obviously one sided since I used to initiate all contact which isn't really a good sign when you're the girl, especially after you've made the first move and everything. We were supposed to meet again but it never happened and I lost his number and in truth I lost interest myself. 

I'd like to feel those intense feelings again I had when I was 15/16, but in a real relationship. A lot of people talk about how the first few weeks or months are a honeymoon phase and I almost totally get that. I'm 23 now and wonder if it'll ever happen, I still haven't done basic stuff like first kiss, holding hands, etc with a guy, people 10+ years younger than me have done stuff like that.

"d06gx7z","Sprint: when my wife and I first moved in together, we decided we were going to get cell phones, as we lived in the big city and would be taking public transport a lot, so easy coordination would essential.  She already had one via a family plan from her folks, so she called Sprint up, asked them to spin her line off on its own contract and then add a second line for my phone.  Easy peasey, they do so, new phones show up in the mail, and life is good.  Then the first month's bill arrives and it's over $1500 for two phones with less than a 100 minutes of usage total.  Needless to say, we go ballistic and carefully comb through the bill for errors.  It first becomes readily apparent that rather than charge us for the set up and phones, they have, in fact charged us for 4 new phones, with two lines on each phone.  They've also octouple billed us for each minute used, applied both Minnesota (where we were when we set up the account) and Virginia (where we were now living) sales tax, fees, etc., to the entirety of the amount due, and generally just added every ridiculous fee in the book, like $100 roaming fees when no roaming data was used and 911 fees for the adjacent county as well as for where we actually lived.

We call up to complain, and the first account person is friendly but clueless and unhelpful, finally deferring it to their ""Billing Buddies"" resolution group for them to call us back and get things resolved.  Days later, and no calls back.  

So I call back and get the run around until I finally get a manager who can remove charges.  This is over my lunch break and I don't have the bill with me, so I'm going off the top of my head, pointing out which ones are erroneous.  This guy actually gets the bill down to about $500 or so, and, before the call ends, I specifically tell him that we will be calling back, as I know there are more errors.  Oh, and he laughs at the ""Billing Buddies"", telling me that he's never heard of them and no such group exists at Sprint.  

We call back yet again to get that last portion taken care of.  Again more run around, 10s of minutes of hold time, etc.  Finally we get to the right person, only to be told that they can't change anything on the bill further as we made a ""verbal contract"" with them on the second call to pay that amount.  I lose it and pull out the old ""let me talk to your manager right now"".  They tell me that they've labeled us as hostile in the system, but they put me through to the manager, who cuts the bill to $250 in exchange for closing the case on it - a totally arbitrary number, but not unrealistic.  I recognize a good deal when I see it and take the offer.

We went through the fine print on every bill we got from Sprint and dropped them like a red hot ball of nickel the moment we could.",1455924201,"we call up to complain, and the first account person is friendly but clueless and unhelpful, finally deferring it to their ""billing buddies"" resolution group for them to call us back and get things resolved.","friendly but clueless","friendly","but",FALSE,"friendly but clueless","clueless",NA,NA,1

"czsu9k5","**GENERAL REMARKS**

Sup, Bacillus anthracis. Your swindler MC had tricks up his sleeve I haven't come across before. This introduction doesn't get far enough into your plot for me to have a clue where the book itself is going, but I'm glad that you chose to open on your MC's business-as-usual. That will give me a sense of who he is before your book's plot gets under way.

That said, this introduction was a slog to read through. You have far too much telling and your character actions are described in confusing fashion. I'm going deep on this critique and will discuss your story with regard to mechanics, setting, staging, character, and plot.

**MECHANICS**

The first line of your story is not a good hook. This is the line:

&gt;A half-full briefcase hung off Archie Barnes' fingers as he walked the dusty road.

A hook should snag my interest and set the tone for the story to come. Yours does neither. It is a flat description of a man walking on a road carrying a briefcase. That is an ordinary event. There is no mystery there. As well, Archie will soon arrive at a mini-mansion. Why would you set me up to expect dust and poverty when within a paragraph he arrives at splendor?

A few times in this introduction you describe objects or actions as being 'a certain way but also a different way'. To wit:

&gt;Three knocks; friendly but precise and decisive.

&gt;resembling a military 180 degree rotation but with inherent grace and femininity

I would not recommend describing things this way. It might feel like you're packing more depth into the description, but for the reader all it does is confuse the situation and cause me to lose faith in the narrator. When I read, I want to trust that the narrator's descriptions are accurate. This style of description sabotages that trust.

You do not always accompany your dialogue with speech tags, e.g.:

&gt;""Good Day Ma'am""

&gt;""Good-morning""

That is a good thing. Speech tags and accompanying actions are not always necessary during dialogue, especially during short exchanges like the one quoted above.

You need to research how to punctuate speech tags. I'm not willing to copy and paste a hundred million times, so I'm not going to point out every instance that you've punctuated dialogue incorrectly. If you'd like me to do this, I recommend putting your story up as a googledoc. For what it's worth, here are three moments when you use incorrect punctuation:

&gt;Martha flushed ""Well thanks.""

&gt;dusted her dress, ""Do you have

&gt;""Ofcourse Madaam,"" his deep and calming

Respectively, the errors in these examples are a missing period, a comma used in place of a period, and a comma used in place of a period. Look this shit up. There are tons of well-written guides out there. While you're at it, I've noticed errors in your prose punctuation as well. You might want to do yourself a favour and read up on commas, colons, semi-colons, and dashes.

**SETTING**

The setting does not exist. You provide all of one description:

&gt;through the floor to ceiling windows, a large open backyard revealed a dying hedge

Up until that point, the reader has very little to go on. I'm aware that Archie has arrived at a ""villa"", but that term is broadly applicable and calls up an image in my head that could very well be wrong for the situation as you want me to perceive it. You've got to give me a couple of strong details as he heads up to the house. These could be things like cars in the driveway, storeys of the house, a patio set. That sort of stuff. If you choose those details carefully, I'll learn everything I need to about the couple Archie is going to meet. This will free you up, description-wise, so that you don't have to tell me how you want me to perceive the couple.

One last comment about setting. These lines, right here, are a cock-tease:

&gt;Archie followed her invitation inside and looked over the entranceway and halls as they moved toward the back of the first floor. He always liked to affirm his expectations of what a mark would have in their home, a certain type of painting, the style of furniture, the cleanliness.

I read those and I get excited for specific, interesting, telling details about the house. I want to know what paintings, furniture, and degree of cleanliness the Wheelers have in their home. You did not follow through on that expectation, which left me frustrated.

**STAGING**

Staging refers to the way characters interact with props and setting. In your story, Archie swaps out the front page of a newspaper, knocks on a door, and hands over false character references. Let's look at how you leveraged these actions to paint him in.

The newspaper-swap was cool. As I said above, I don't know where you got that from, but it's an undeniably sneaky way to screw with a person's head. What's unfortunate is the way you presented this action. It comes on the heels of your two opening paragraphs of told description, which meant I was bored out of my mind when I got to the line. It is introduced as a flashback, which in this case works but does detract from the joy of seeing a con-man with the balls to walk up to a stranger's house at 5am to fuck with their newspaper. And, most importantly, it is explained to the reader in mind-numbing detail. Look at this line:

&gt;A replaced report detailing one of the few stable banks left making an investment in an undisclosed black market product.

Not only is this a sentence fragment, it is convoluted as fuck. It took me -- I shit you not -- four reads to understand this sentence. I'm still not sure I get it. A better way of going about this swap would have been to make it apparent, from the headline alone, what the problem was, and to then do away with the convoluted explanation of why it matters to the Wheelers. You could have Archie discuss the article with them, make it clear through their dialogue that the article has shaken the Wheelers, and later reveal that Archie swapped the front page. That would be a fun reveal for the audience.

Then there's the knock on the door. As details go, this one is boring. It could be skipped. We don't need a play-by-play of every action Archie takes when he comes to visit, and the way that he knocks on their door is not at all exciting. You do your best to make it important, but you do this using that style of self-contradictory description I mentioned in my section on Mechanics:

&gt;Three knocks; friendly but precise and decisive.

Unless he kicks the door or knocks it with the gilt head of a cane, I don't care about the way he knocks it. Find better ways to have characters interact with their environment.

And with his fake character references, you once again sabotaged a neat physical detail by telling me that it matters. I'm referring to this line:

&gt;This statement made an impression on Martha, it was said with humbleness, and yet certainty.

How does Archie know his statement made an impression on her? What did she do to show that she was impressed? Show us that response, rather than hinting at it.

Also you've got another one of those self-contradictory descriptions in there.

**CHARACTER**

In discussing character, I'm going to ignore the information that was told to me. I'm doing this because lines like this one:

&gt;One afternoon with Archie Barnes was like a week travelling in another country with a local who dropped everything to show them his world; a beautiful world full of charm and promises.

are meaningless unless you back them up with the actual actions he takes and lines he speaks and ways he presents himself that communicate such a grand feeling to the people he's swindling. When you lay those details on me so bluntly, I don't believe you. All it tells me is that the narrator wants me to feel a certain way about Archie. It doesn't make me feel that way.

So, what do I know about Archie? He swaps out the front page of a newspaper, knocks three times on a door, makes heavy eye contact with a married woman, and makes unspecific observations about the inside that woman's house. Also he seems to dislike the affluent for some reason.

Based on these actions, I can't tell whether I like the guy or not. Based on the way Ms. Wheeler responds to him, I get the feeling he's attractive. So there's that.

His dialogue doesn't tell me much about him. He speaks lines I could imagine just about any character speaking.

The upshot of all this, is that Archie would benefit from greater specificity. Show me ways in which he is different from other people. Does he have an unusual watch? Does he wear expensive cologne? What details does he notice about the Wheeler's home? Having answers to questions like these ones in your story will do a lot to fill me in on who Archie is as a person.

**PLOT**

A week ago, Archie planted a fake newspaper. Today, he enters the Wheelers' home. End of Plot.

That's not a lot to have happen in the first 1000 words of a story. Your problem in this story is the amount of time you've given over to explaining who Archie is and how he operates. You've got to stop holding the reader's hand and trust in your ability to communicate who Archie is by showing him in action. 

This introduction could be made way stronger if you went into the scene without explaining anything about Archie's background. Let us believe he's a bank representative. Convince us he's on the Wheelers' side. Make it seem like the issue here is saving the Wheelers's money. At the end of the chapter, drop the information that he's swindled them. It'll say everything you need about who Archie is and how he operates because we, the audience, will have been swindled by him. We will feel, in our gut, that he is a smooth-talking scam artist. That'll save you the mind-numbing exposition in your first three paragraphs.

**CLOSING REMARKS**

This story needs less exposition and more action.

Please do look up proper punctuation. 

Do consider submitting on googledocs.

"czmbacv","I sent you a link to the only people I know of who took a look at the truth behind some of the pictures the anti zoo people like to use. The website is made by a zoophile, that is true, but I'm not aware of the website being illegal anywhere.

&gt; Secondly this group trying to save this poor girl actually helps dogs

I never doubted that. I just suggested that their methods of raising money may bend the truth a little bit.

&gt; there's been several rescue groups that had confirmed cases of animals being sexually assaulted by people

Which is certainly true, but it also remains true that in the case you posted any statement about what happened to this dog is basically speculation.

&gt; Thirdly as to why people have such a huge problem with people like you is because damn near every time one of you crawls out of the woodwork it's never someone who grabbed a jar of peanut butter to see if their dog would start licking their crotch(which is gross and weird enough) but it's someone who tries to gut their poor victim first or they break their legs or some shit like that!

Here is where you need to realize that you don't have **any** statistics. Here are a few pointers: There are many humans who sexually assault other humans and nobody thinks they are representative. Most zoophiles will lead a life where they are very quiet about it (unless they can post anonymously online like me right now) because 1) personal impact like social ostracization or possible discrimination at the workplace 2) it puts the animal in real danger to be out. Word is that the animals that are taken away from zoophiles often end up at shelters and are viewed as ""damaged"", whether it's true or not, and are thus rather killed than placed somewhere else. We don't really know how much of this is true, but the fear is already enough to keep people quiet.

To me it's quite obvious that the probability of hearing about anyone having done anything sexual with an animal is higher the less care this person has for themselves and the animal (e.g. uploading porn. I'm pretty sure nobody here in this subreddit would do that, yet a significant amount of people who get ""caught"", do so because they uploaded porn of themselves). And I believe the more careless they are, the higher the probability they are also some form of abusers.

That's where you need to realize that you can't say something like that because you need to consider all the cases you never heard about. And neither you nor I know how many people are in sexual relationships with animals that do no harm whatsoever. To get a glimpse, try reading the books/research of Hani Miletski, Andrea Beetz, Miriam Nasswetter, etc. For example chapter 5 ""FINDING SUBJECTS/PARTICIPANTS"" in Miletski's book ""Understanding Bestiality and Zoophilia"" should be enlightening as to zoophiles being secretive unless they know they can trust you. You for example are not a person I would trust about it in real life. And you would likely not suspect it of me, because for some reason people seem to think vegan =&gt; animal rights =&gt; must be against sex with animals. Which is not really true. Here is an excerpt from Miletski's book where she cites a letter she wrote that might shock you:

&gt; I can only go by what my subjects told me: The majority of my subjects love their animal-partner. Some see them as a spouse and will do anything for them. Sexual relations with the animal is an expression of love for them, and if the animal tells them, with it’ s body language, that it is not in the mood for love-making, the majority of my subjects will leave the animal alone. **In fact, many of them are members of the Humane Society and other organizations that are taking care of animals.**

  

&gt; Yet I had sit there looking at my pup my best friend bounce around like her usual happy self and think about the dog who needs surgery wondering ""What sick fuck would do this to that poor dog?

&gt; Then there's that other poor baby Beatrice, that poor deaf pup who everyone said was so sweet and friendly but in such horrible pain and so scared died because of her injuries and that was CONFIRMED to have been caused by a person

Ah and zoophiles were an easy target because they won't publicly and openly defend themselves, I see.

Let's say for the sake of argument she was the victim of violent sexual abuse. You see, I wonder the same thing: What kind of monster could do that? I know that I couldn't, even if I wanted to. I don't want to hurt any animals. Do you allege there is a connection between sexual attraction and the desire to inflict harm? I can assure you: There isn't.

I'm not aware of any such studies, but I wonder if we can transfer the conclusion researchers have come to when it comes to human rape (random quote from the first website I found about it):

&gt; Myth: The primary motive for rape is impulsive sexual desire.

&gt; Fact: Studies show that the major motive for rape is power, not sex. Sex is used as a weapon to inflict pain, violence and humiliation. Most rapists appear to have normal personalities with an abnormal tendency to be aggressive and violent.

I mean, there are many animal abusers who make animals suffer without apparent sexual motive. E.g. the stuff that ends up on /r/rage like recently the people who set a cat on fire. Is it possible that people who violently rape animals do it for a similar reason, instead of the primary motive being that they are sexually attracted to them?

&gt; and the thing is still running around free

And I can assure you, if this person came to /r/zoophilia with this story, they would not be welcome here.

&gt; now I have to worry about her being dognapped and raped on top of all of that!

And before that you had to worry about her being dognapped and set on fire, just for example. Because nonsexual animal abusers exist, just as sexual animal abusers do. You can either worry about it all the time, or you can take solace in the fact that still they are quite rare and in all likelihood your dogs will never be dognapped by one of them.

"czm6tiq","Did you literally just message me a goddamn LINK to a Zoophilia website? What the actual hell I'm not try to get myself sent to prison! Frankly the only remotely criminal/taboo things on my search history are ""How To Download Tor"" ""How To Buy Outlawed Knives"" ""belladonna and wolfbane flying ointment"", symptoms of aconite poisoning, a few comments I've made about Republican and Democratic politicians 
and a BDSM gear website that sold dragon wings and I'd like to keep it that way. Secondly this group trying to save this poor girl actually helps dogs and has so far found them good homes and provides advice on how to apply as a foster parent for shelter pets and how to rescue animals that are literally often minutes from being put down. If anything they're the ones who are trying to make a difference and there's been several rescue groups that had confirmed cases of animals being sexually assaulted by people and that includes witnesses, DNA evidence and even video evidence. Thirdly as to why people have such a huge problem with people like you is because damn near every time one of you crawls out of the woodwork it's never someone who grabbed a jar of peanut butter to see if their dog would start licking their crotch(which is gross and weird enough) but it's someone who tries to gut their poor victim first or they break their legs or some shit like that! Fourthly that dog looks a lot like my rescued pup whom I've had and cared for and protected for five years now. The dog is the closest thing to a child I'll ever have do to an utter lack of maternal instincts(not that I'd need them anyway). Far as I'm concerned she's my best friend and we both look out for each other and protect one another, she's even protective of my two elderly dogs. Yet I had sit there looking at my pup my best friend bounce around like her usual happy self and think about the dog who needs surgery wondering ""What sick fuck would do this to that poor dog? What type of monster thinks it's funny to rape a dog?!"" Unfortunately I seem to have the answer if this wasn't a case of a breeding gone very very bad or a dog with a rare medical condition that wasn't properly cared for. Then there's that other poor baby Beatrice, that poor deaf pup who everyone said was so sweet and friendly but in such horrible pain and so scared died because of her injuries and that was CONFIRMED to have been caused by a person if one can even call such a thing a person. Poor thing died because of what happened to her and the thing is still running around free, now instead of just worrying about people trying to steal my dog and fight her or kill her because she's a pit bull(despite being the friendliest dog ever) or kill her because they're just a psychopath now I have to worry about her being dognapped and raped on top of all of that! As if the world didn't have enough problems as it is! As to how I ended up here you can thank Google for that misfortune along with causing my faith in humanity to plummet drastically, once again lapsing into depression and last but not least causing my general fear and anxiety(which is bad enough on a good day) about my beloved dogs being harmed if they're not with me at all times to increase by at least 300%!

"cz8dwng","I don't really agree that you're ""supposed"" to. It's a direction many people will go because they assume the game is designed in the same lazy way as other games have been and there's nothing new or remarkable.

We're trained that way by games and developers as of recent - spare? Nope. Spare? nope. Oh well. Okay, talk. Talk.. Talk? Nope? Okay. Guess I _have_ to kill her.

And that's it, that's all the effort most people will put into not killing her because that's what we've been taught to expect from a decade of developers just using the same tricks and mechanics we're so very accustomed to.

But yeah, I don't think you necessarily ""need"" to kill Toriel. Some of us would spare monsters in every game if we could and wish games in general had more emotional and moral depth than ""this guy bad kill bad guy u win loot u hero level up"" etc. So you might say that you're supposed to because it reveals the story, but I think not revealing it is just as potent - why?

Because it lets you get deep into the game without realizing it. You spare past Toriel and feel good, you continue along the way, totally unaware of the depth. You go through Snowdin forests, meet some wacky characters, cruise around Snowdin town, have some laughs and japes, and keep going.

But then you hit Waterfall and the tone shifts - the game was just kinda wacky and light hearted, the enemies cute and friendly, but Waterfall is somber, it's almost foreboding or mournful. Up til' now it's been mostly rainbows and sunshine and you've merrily friended your way along, but there's now something more. The plaques and wall writings tell of a deeper story, of betrayal and hatred between races, and you go further to meet Undyne and learn more of the plight of monsters at the hands of humans.

The discovery later about saving and such becomes more poignant and powerful because you just aren't expecting that level of depth - if you kill Toriel then you find it out much sooner, but otherwise you have a lot longer to get comfortably immersed in a happy and simple world.. and then, suddenly, it flips all around and, looking back, things fall into place one after another. It makes more and more sense just as shit starts to really get real.

So yeah, killing Toriel and having the reveal sooner is definitely a powerful story path, but I don't think avoiding it means you miss out, merely that your experience is markedly different, albeit still powerful.",1453506042,"but then you hit waterfall and the tone shifts - the game was just kinda wacky and light hearted, the enemies cute and friendly, but waterfall is somber, it's almost foreboding or mournful.","cute and friendly","friendly",NA,FALSE,"cute and friendly","cute",NA,NA,0

Benefits:

They have daily classes so you will have a set schedule to work out. 

Every MMA gym I have ever joined is full of friendly, upbeat people. Moods are contagious.

The people you see everyday will also give you a reason to hold yourself accountable. 

More than any other exercise program, in MMA classes you usually have to interact with people. IE: Holding pads, rolling jiu jitsu, sparring, etc. Makes it easy to meet people, make friends, etc.

Not only are people friendly, but usually they will be attractive, single people, of both sexes. Makes it a good place to meet a potential SO, who will already have positive exercise habits, making it even easier to stay on track.

Fusion rifles are not particularly user friendly but good rolls are available weekly through Armsday on the Thesan so it's cheap and available

The Thesan has a comparatively user friendly recoil pattern for OHKs outside shotgun range

Many people look at the special slot as a OHK slot not as a neutral game modifier (Telestoooooo!)

Crucible Radio has been talking up fusions, especially the Thesan, for almost a month now and eventually settled on the idea that fusions will benefit some players but sniping, at its most extreme level of proficiency where engagement range no longer matters, will win. Many people on CPB either are or want to become that proficient

Lower gun skill players (not bad players, that's different) will gravitate towards weapons that kill most easily and consistently; higher gun skill players will use weapons that kill most quickly. Fusions occupy neither of those extremes and require a hybrid of gun skill and situational awareness for a payoff neither end of the spectrum sees as worth it

I really do think fusions have a place and that all the archetypes are viable but I totally get why people might disagree. When people evangelize on the streets I'm fine with that and I'll listen. That faith works for them and that's awesome. If I say ""no thanks, not for me"" and they respond with ""you're going to hell!""... That's less cool. Downvotes are supposed to be used when something doesn't contribute to the conversation but general Reddit use seems to just be ""I disagree!"" Let them, it's one less charge to be listening for.

You're going to want all the ""essentials"" listed on [this page here](http://www.tesgeneral.com/#!oblivion-guide/c1pnd) (beware, NSFW towards the bottom of the page), though obviously you need to choose between OblivionXP and Realistic Leveling. I'd suggest the latter.

Also of note on that page are Dynamic Map and Map Marker Overhaul. Dynamic Map may as well just be in the essential section, but I believe MMO lets you turn off quest markers (though I believe Darnified UI has an option for it, as well). I'd also suggest HUD Status Bars and HUD Status Bars Enhanced. That is also an option for turning off quest markers, and if it's too difficult to figure out the customization stuff (which it kinda is) there are examples all over the place. Honestly, *most* of the mods listed under Extra UI mods are pretty good. Display Stats, Quest Log Manager, Realistic Player Dialogue Overhaul, TTYM, Expanded Greetings, Dialogue Tweaks and Fixes, Dialogue Idles, all good.

As for other mods on that page: Enhanced Economy is interesting. I like it, personally, though certain settings do take away bargaining.

Under no circumstances use Reneer's Guard Overhaul, it's a script bloater and breaks a lot of stuff (which I learned the hard way).

Midas Magic is a famous one but not entirely lore-friendly.

Put It In Its Place is definitely one you want to get, makes grabbing not stupid.

For quest mods, in terms of lore friendly: Kvatch Rebuilt, Better Dungeons, Mannimarco Revisited (as already mentioned), A Brotherhood Renewed, and a Better Dark Brotherhood Sanctuary are all lore-friendly. The Lost Spires isn't lore unfriendly, necessarily, and I understand if you don't want to get it, but it's probably one of the greatest Oblivion mods of all time.

Elsweyr Anequina, Tales from Elsweyr Anequina, and (if you're willing to use HG Eye Candy Body replacer, which is NSFW) Valenwood Improved are all pretty good landmass mods.

I also use Bank of Cyrodiil, [this guy's](http://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/users/13821/?tb=mods&amp;pUp=1) Oblivifall mods (and a few of his others), Bruma Guild Reconstructed, Fighter's Guild Quests, Mage's Guild Quests, Guild Advancement, a bunch of RealSwords mods (easy to look up) which are essentially lore friendly but somewhat overpowered, annnnnd...

And as always, regardless of which of my suggestions you take, always read instructions, and learn to use Wyre Bash's installer feature; it's much easier and cleaner than manual installs. Also learn to clean mods with TESIVEdit, it's just a good habit.

Windows.  Getting a mac for web development is basically shooting yourself in the foot before a race.  Do yourself a favor and just install windows.  If you wanted command line you should have went Linux.  There is absolutely no reason to run mac unless you are building apple apps.

"cybxc6v","You don't really need any until you hit max level.

First a question though, do you have the curse client? If you don't download it [here](http://www.curse.com/client) it just makes downloading and updating addons easy.

At max level I would say all you really need is DeadlyBossMods. This just makes tracking boss abilities much easier and allows you to react to them. It gives you timers for abilities, a countdown when scary things are going to be cast ect.

Beyond that there are several addons you can use to improve your overall gameplay experience. Here are a few I use:
1) Recount: Allows you to track a variety of things in a fight such as healing per second and damage per second.

2) TellMeWhen or WeakAuras: Help to track cooldowns and abilities for your rotation, TMW is more beginner friendly but less in depth.

3) TradeSkillMaster: Makes buying and selling items on the Auction House much simpler, if you want to make gold I'd recommend checking out [this](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaykbCbJyZPwMohLQaVoFcA) youtube channel as a side note.

4) Postal: Just makes managing your in game mail easier.

5) Miks Scrolling Battle Text: Allows you to customize the combat text that shows up, it can make it a little cleaner and easier to look at.

6) Bagnon: Simplifies the inventory interface to make it easier to look at (one large bag instead of several small ones)

7) MasterPlan can make managing your garrison (which you get at level 90) much easier.

8) Elvui: This is a complete rework of the basic UI. It allows for far more customization and allows you to move/change just about everything. This addon however cannot be downloaded through curse and must be taken directly from [this](https://www.tukui.org/dl.php) link then moved into the addon folder which can be found within the WoW folder. If you decide you want this and are having trouble with it or have questions about it feel free to message me.

There are more I use but they are more specific for tanks/healers hope this helps a bit.

That being said, the biggest concern that actually is worth considering is just how sheltered and narrow the views are from the people who have never left here. It is their own little world. People are kind and friendly, but they really have no clue that the LDS culture is not universal. 

We don't worry much about whether people we know are LDS, but we have found it is far more fruitful to pursue friendships with people who have lived other places vs. trying to find common ground with people who have only ever lived in Utah County. 

The other odd thing we have noticed is the strong undercurrent of greed in Utah County. People expect more money when selling items or offering services, and will milk you for all they think they can get away with. And for some reason, it is just normal around here. But again, we've had better experiences with people who did not grow up in Utah county. It is not a deal-breaker on living here, but we do get a bit weary of having to approach anything involving money as if our neighbors are used car salesmen.

The signage was confusing and led me to what I thought was the exit to the terminal, but which was actually the TSA secondary screening line.  Once I realized my mistake I turned to walk to the exit and was physically stopped by a guy who pulled me to the checkout station, ignoring my explanation that I'd already been through screening and had a connecting flight on the other end of the airport which was literally waiting on me because my previous flight was delayed 4 hours waiting for some other connecting flight (and this is LAX, so easily a 1.5 mile walk).

The secondary screening guy saw all this and I guess didn't like the cut of my jib, because he made me open every single compartment in my luggage (which is a lot of pockets, because I had been traveling for a long ass time).  Made me throw out a bunch of arbitrary shit like my toothpaste, which again, had been cleared through screening already.  Made me explain where I got every souvenir I was bringing back - just your stereotypical god-complex TSA agent.

He's very outgoing and friendly, but that's actually a facade from previous trauma. He's quite active and eager to learn, which may or may not be also a result of the trauma. He's very loyal and firmly sticks to his beliefs. He's from London, UK.

* First choice of power is superhuman agility, he's basically a mix between an acrobat and ninja. He can do various acrobatic techniques easier than normal humans and loves to parkour. The drawback is that he gets fatigued easily, doing anything physically above the normal human capacity greatly exhausts him and he needs to take a long rest (several hours to several days) before doing that again.

* Second choice of power is wall crawling, he can scale up walls like a lizard. He trained himself more acrobatic techniques to scale surfaces faster and more efficiently, also leads to his love of parkour. The drawback is that he needs to constantly move or his touch loses its effect (like gluesticks), hence the need for the acrobatic things.

* Third choice of power is synesthesia. Dylan already has good senses, but when he uses this power it gets raised to eleven. Years of book reading and people reading allow him to extract tons of information just from the way someone walks (Sherlock style), his power increases that number.

"cxzsx9b","I do not feel the need to be ashamed of my country, as you pointed out, that would be highly illogical. Rather I grew in in a country that is not nationalistic in general, with parents that aren't patriotic, school teachers that don't think our country is great and a media that doesn't prioritize patriotism. (doesn't  mean it isn't euro and specificlly german centric tho, but that is to be expected)

Because those are normally the factors that shape a person in that regard. So I would assume that a person from Germany is less likely to feel national pride then a person from the USA for example, since Germany is one of the least patriotic countries in the world currently. 

First, I should probably make it clearer what I mean: I think nationalism and national pride is illogical and more often then not bad and hurtful overall. Feeling proud for accomplishments that you had no part in is just as stupid as apologising for something you are not responsible for. Feeling love towards a certain design pattern is also probably illogical. If you like the people, the political system and the nature of your nature and, because of this, like the country and like the flag because it represents a country you love, this is logical. 

I simply can't understand how you are rationalising the fact that you are proud of the fact that some people, who have no connection to you, accomplished something and that you are life on a certain piece of rock. What is there to take pride in? 

    
I hope it is okay if I cross post another comment I wrote some time ago?

&gt; Well I'd say pride for your country is, at best, neutral and, at worst, leads to increased nationalism, chauvinism and the xenophoic attitude that accompanies nationalism. I do not have english sources for this, only German ones. Interestingly enough, here is also a difference between the German Wikipedia page on Patriotism and the English one. On the German one, critics are mentioneed and negative effects that might exist are also found.
&gt; 
&gt; So, often people divide nationalists and patriotists, one simply loves his country which leads to more companionship and volunteering activity while the other one dislikes other countries and thinks of himself as superior. However, according to the studies cited in [this article](http://www.sueddeutsche.de/wissen/liebe-zum-land-die-maer-vom-guten-patrioten-1.912131), this seperation is wrong.
&gt; 
&gt; [Here](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ejsp.342/citedby) is a relevant study in the European Journal of Social Psychology which studies the effect in-group-love in children and patriotism which concludes that all children tought that the UK was better then Germany, it was cleaner and more friendly, but the older they good the more they masked this feeling and simply resorted to applying the positive attributes to UK and stopped applying the negative ones to Germany. Thus, Adam Rutland concluded, that approval (acclaim?) for the own nation correlates with devalorization of other nations.

&gt;A portmanteau of ""[Wombat](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Wombat)"" and ""[Booty](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Booty)"" used to describe butts that are attractive, well muscled, impressive and powerful.



&gt;Wombats are small and friendly, but they are also feisty, muscular, cuddly, determined, unstoppable little tanks that use their powerful butts and thighs to crush the skulls of their enemies. The unexpected powerful muscle and single-minded determination beneath the friendly veneer of the wombat (plus the fact that it literally uses its butt and thighs to crush things to death) inspired the term ""Wombat Booty"" which was shortened to ""Wombooty"". Wombooty Wednesdays became a theme used to celebrate rear ends and any work out progress seen making butts stronger and better!

Before he did that, ""Pirate King"" wasn't really a term used. After he performed the feat of reaching Raftel, people started calling him that rather like a nickname. After his death, and that promise of treasure, that nickname grew into a title with real respect and weight behind it. Being the Pirate King meant something.

Luffy will become Pirate King by finding the One Piece.

In order to find the One Piece, he has to go to Raftel.

To get to Raftel, he has to defeat the Yonko. The Yonko are basically in a stalemate, IIRC. Not one of them can make a play to reach Raftel without the other three ganging up on him, no Yonko would work for another, and the four of them are a buffer between non-Yonko pirates and Raftel.

If, somehow, some pirate was able to reach Raftel without proving his strength his reign would only be as long as he could survive. He'd be the target of everyone to prove himself.

The way I see it going down. Luffy will take down Kaido and Big Mom with help, that person taking over the empires after their respective Yonko are defeated. Then he fights Shanks in a friendly but serious duel to prove his strength. Kaido and Big Mom will team up with Blackbeard, Blackbeard promising to support them in getting their empires back after becoming Pirate King.

Blackbeard tries to reach Raftel. The government moves to stop him, because they don't want another Pirate King, let alone Blackbeard. Luffy. with support from the people he helped become replacement Yonko, fights both sides, reaches Raftel and finds the One Piece.

"cx9uvj4","&gt; The Wizards of the Finnish Epics are in many ways comparable to deities. Indeed given that they helped to create the world and humanity they might be said to be greater than the deities of Greece which had no part in the creation of the world or humanity. There are many scholars who speculate that Odin was based on a Finno-Ugric Shaman Character and so was not an original god of the Germanic peoples but one borrowed from them. Of all Finland's wizards Väinämöinen is perhaps the most important for it was he who separated chaos from the cosmic egg thus forming the universe. 

&gt;*Väinämöinen in Finnish mythology*

&gt;Mikael Agricola in 1551 called Väinämöinen the god of chants, songs and poetry and it is indeed true that in many stories Väinämöinen was the child of the central figure at the birth of the world. But Väinämöinen isn't strictly speaking a deity as we would see it in the modern era, rather Väinämöinen was a shaman figure during a time when there was little separating shaman from deity. The earth diver myth which starts the Kalevala (the epic about Väinämöinen) is copied by many of the people who are related to the Finno-Ugric people including a number of Native American tribes as far away as New Mexico. In other words we can learn a lot about the orginal Finnish beliefs regarding wizards by studying the shamans of certain American tribes and Siberian Tribes. Most such peoples believe that humans are related to deities in the same way which Väinämöinen himself is, and thus he might be argued to one of the first humans.

&gt;At first there were only primal waters and Sky. But Sky also had a daughter named Ilmatar. One day, seeking a resting place Ilmatar descended to the waters. There she swam and floated for 700 years until she noticed a beautiful bird also searching for a resting place. Ilmatar raised her knee towards the bird so it could land, which it did. The bird then laid six eggs made of gold and one made of iron. As the bird incubated her eggs Ilmatar's knee grew warmer and warmer until finally she was burned by the heat and reacted by jerking her leg. This motion dislodged the eggs, which then fell and shattered in the waters. Land was formed from the lower part of one of the eggshells while sky formed from the top. The egg whites turned into the moon and stars, and the yolk became the sun.
Ilmatar spent another few hundred years floating in the waters, admiring the results of these broken eggs until she could not resist the urge growing inside her to continue creation. Her foot prints became pools for fish and simply by pointing she created contours in the land. In this way she made all that is. Then one day she gave birth to Väinämöinen, the first man, whose father was the sea. Väinämöinen swam off until he found land, but the land was barren so he asked the Great Bear in the sky for help. A boy carrying seeds was sent down to him, and this boy spread flora across the land.

&gt;In other words Väinämöinen asked for additional aid in creating the world as a shaman or wizard would, he did not himself create it and so cannot be strictly said to be a deity.

&gt;In the 19th century, some folklorists, most notably Elias Lönnrot, the writer of Kalevala, disputed Väinämöinen's mythological background, claiming that he was an ancient hero, or an influential shaman who lived perhaps in the 9th century. Stripping Väinämöinen from his direct godlike characteristics, Lönnrot turned Väinämöinen to the son of the primal goddess Ilmatar, whom Lönnrot had invented by himself. In this story, it was she who was floating in the sea when a duck laid eggs on her knee. He possessed the wisdom of the ages from birth, for he was in his mother's womb for seven hundred and thirty years, while she was floating in the sea and while the earth was formed. It is after praying to the sun, the moon, and the great bear (the stars, referring to Ursa Major) he is able to escape his mother's womb and dive into the sea.
Väinämöinen is presented as the 'eternal bard', who exerts order over chaos and established the land of Kaleva, that so many of the events in Kalevala revolve around. His search for a wife brings the land of Kaleva into, at first friendly, but later hostile contact with its dark and threatening neighbour in the north, Pohjola. This conflict culminates in the creation and theft of the Sampo, a magical artifact made by Ilmarinen; and the subsequent mission to recapture it, and a battle which ends up splintering the Sampo and dispersing its parts around the world to parts unknown.

&gt;As with most such wizard shamans Väinämöinen used chants, poems, and songs in order to cast his spells. It was songs in Ugric and Indo-European belief which allowed wizards to cast their spells. Väinämöinen also demonstrated his magical voice by sinking the impetuous Joukahainen into a bog by singing. Väinämöinen also slays a great pike and makes a magical kantele from its jawbones.
Väinämöinen's end is a hubristic one. The 50th and final poem of the Kalevala tells the story of the maiden Marjatta, who becomes pregnant after eating a berry, giving birth to a baby boy. This child is brought to Väinämöinen to examine and judge. His verdict is that such a strangely-born infant needs to be put to death. In reply, the newborn child, mere two weeks old, chides the old sage for his sins and transgressions, such as allowing the maiden Aino, sister of Joukahainen to drown herself. Following this, the baby is baptized and named king of Kalevala. Defeated, Väinämöinen goes to the shores of the sea, where he sings for himself a boat of copper, with which he sails away from the mortal realms. In his final words, he promises that there shall be a time when he shall return, when his crafts and might shall once again be needed. Thematically, the 50th poem thus echoes the arrival of Christianity to Finland and the subsequent fading into history of the old pagan beliefs. This is a common theme among epics, for in the tale of King Arthur, Arthur declares a similar promise before departing for Avalon.

"cx9hc8w","Your intro made me think of something that happened to me this weekend. I was in bed with a girl and I spanked her once, she moaned hard so I gave her another one even harder but no windup, a hard slap on the ass.

She said she didn't like it but then she paused and slapped me in the face lightly. She immediately said ""sorry, but I had to do it.""  That forever cemented her as just a plate (if that), though of course I didn't make any indication. 

Your post solidified what the underlying dynamic was and it was consistent with my own analysis. 

This was a girl who I had invited out once several months back. She gave me excuses and after a few attempts to schedule something told me she was ""sort of getting involved with someone else""

I stopped chasing completely. I saw her incidentally once or twice a month but just kept everything friendly but distant. After months she contacts me to invite me out with another of her friends to see a concert. I agree and it's honestly the easiest lay I ever had. I didn't have to think about logistics, she had everything prepared. I just had to show up and not fuck up. 

But what is happening here?  It's simple. I am plan B. I did not have the frame you described. She is the one chasing but it's a scramble against the wall. Her every move was calculated but it was like a script I'd already read. I nodded in all the right places, and just went caveman. There was no need for a&amp;a, because she was being ridiculous enough for the both of us. So many cliches I was surprised she didn't actually say ""I'm not that kind of girl""

So why did she slap me? It was a calculated move. I saw it, there was a delay in her reaction.  I'm not sure what she was thinking but it was the outcome of being in her frame. She was going the way I wanted so I didn't think I needed my hands on the wheel. Let that be a lesson: Frame is everything. 

If anyone can explain how she thought her slap would work in her favor, I am all ears. From my perspective it just destroyed any possibility of a relationship.

James Harvey And His Daughter, Kat, Arrive At Drafty, Old Whipstaff Manor. Its Greedy Owner, Carrigan Crittendon, Has Hired Dr. Harvey To Exorcise The House s Apparitions: a Friendly But Lonely Young Ghost Named Casper, Who s Just Looking For a Friend, And His Outrageous Uncles Stretch, Stinkie And Fatso. If The Plan Works, She And Dibs, Her Partner-In-Slime, Can Get Their Hands On The Manor s Fabled Treasure.
March of the Exorcists The film makes extensive use of computer-generated imagery to create the titular character and the other ghosts alongside him. Rodney Dangerfield (as Fatso s human form) Amblin cancelled the sequel because they did not believe there would be enough interest from moviegoers.
James and Kat s relationship is strained, after the death of her mother and his wife Amelia, he devotes all of his time into finding her, believing her to have unfinished business and having not moved on to the afterlife. As a result, Kat has had no chance to make friends as they are constantly moving across the country. Upon arriving in Maine, Casper s plan to befriend Kat and her father backfires when his chaotic uncles come home and try to force the Harveys out. James stands resolute and manages to successfully move in. Kat tries to fit in at school, inadvertently gaining popularity for staying at the popular Whipstaff manor and winning the students over for a Halloween party there instead of the popular Amber s boat house where it would have been less authentic.
Wells also credited the uncertainty of actress Christina Ricci returning and Fox s ill-received direct-to-video Casper films as contributing to the cancellation of Casper 2. Over four days it grossed $22,091,975, averaging $8,140 per theater. Follow us on TWITTER: Read our full synopsis and find details about cast and crew. Meanwhile, Casper Has Found a Kindred Spirit In Kat, But The Ghostly Trio Will Not Tolerate Fleshies In Their House.
At the chime of 10, just as Casper and Kat kiss, the spell breaks and he becomes a ghost again. Meanwhile, the trio tries to make peace with James and even say they will find Amelia for him, while Casper and Kat become friends. Título original Casper Año 1995 Duración 96 min. Kat learns that Casper does not remember the details of his life, so she takes him to remember it; eventually coming across an old abandoned toy room. He says boo to the guests, but they scream in terror and flee the manor.
Malachi Pearson as Casper McFadden, originally a 12-year-old boy who died from a pneumonia attack after a sled accident. Carrigan and Dibs overhear this and contemplate one of them dying and coming back as a ghost in order to get into the vault supposedly containing the treasure they sought. Casper then gives up his chance at a new life in order to bring James back to life. It is much darker in tone in comparison to the sequels and spin offs.

"cx3kcae","I live in the LA area where we have a few major comic book shops and the ability to also choose from a number of smaller ones. What I've come to realize are important for me are:

1. Cleanliness - Have a place that's nice, neat, clean, and organized. I don't want to feel like I'm visiting a run down or unprofessional business when looking for comics. It doesn't have to be super well decorated or anything, but having a nice atmosphere is really key to getting me to revisit.

2. Employees that are personable yet professional. Employees should be helpful and friendly, but not overbearing or saying ""why this comic is the best and why that comic sucks"". I really love it when I go into my LCBS and am greeted with a friendly hello but am otherwise left alone to do what I want.

3. Good selection and stock. It's the worst when you visit a shop on Wednesday and find that the issue you wanted to pick up already sold out.

4. Showing customer appreciation in small ways, like giving a free bag and board with each comic. My favorite shop does this, and one time when I asked them if they sold loose boards (I needed like 10 of them), they just gave them to me for free. It cost them close to nothing but was something I appreciated quite a bit and always remember. Other shops in the area charge like 15/25 cents for them and while that's not a huge deal, I specifically shop at the one that provided that small piece of kindness.

Otherwise the biggest thing that gets me to visit a shop is a signing event by creators/writers/artists. I don't really visit a comic book shop for anything other than the purpose of grabbing a comic book, but that's just me.",1447785999,"employees should be helpful and friendly, but not overbearing or saying ""why this comic is the best and why that comic sucks"".","helpful and friendly","friendly",NA,FALSE,"helpful and friendly","helpful",NA,NA,0

Everyone in a customer service position has heard every joke already. If you have a go to joke you use every time you are in position X it has been done to death by everyone.
I understand people are just trying to be friendly, and I have been on both sides of this myself, but think about your favorite joke; now imagine someone diffrent telling you that joke at least once a week, every week, and every time you have to act like it's funny. Doesn't matter how funny it was originally it will get old, fast.

In my case it was my job to check any $50 or $100 bills that customers paid with. And at least 80% of the time while I was checking it I would hear some variation of ""oh, it should be good, I just printed it off this morning.""

Depending on the platform you are talking about and the timeframe, there might have been decent versions that were better than most of the linux distros about, but depending on the hardware, the slack distro could be gussied up and made as stable and pretty.

The main thing was that various manufacturers of specialized PC cards and POS terminals used Xenix and Openserver as a service platform.

SF people are friendly but highly opinionated; hence where Yelp the review site is based in.

Definitely I recommend looking at the SF michelin guide for restaurants. Go to China Town, Japantown, Hayes Valley, Castro district, financial district/Embarcadero, Haight district, Noe Valley, and north beach for the districts. 

You should also consider taking the BART which is a subway that will not only take you within SF but also nearby cities such as Oakland and Berkeley; it can even take you to/from the SFO and OAK airports. Also the Muni is a rail public transportation within the city; both are cheap. If you get a chance to eat, you should try [Monsieur Benjamin](http://www.yelp.com/biz/monsieur-benjamin-san-francisco) and Absinthe for great bistro fare as the SF Bay Area really excels in French cuisine and also some of the local SF style Italian such as the restaurant called [Perbacco](http://www.yelp.com/biz/perbacco-san-francisco) as there's also a history of Italian immigrants coming to the SF bay area.

If you're looking for more restaurants as you gotta eat and SF is a big Foodie capital in the US (you'd be doing yourself a big disservice if you don't try out some of their restaurants along with their bars as SF is a big drinking town), you should see ""Check Please Bay Area"" that's a local public access show where diners share their top restaurants (this episode has Monsieur Benjamin) in the episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMM2knSM92Q

"cwqatvh","     The setting is modern day Florida, in the fruitful suburbs of Jacksonville. I had just finished my work for the day, and wanted to blow off some steam. I decided to take a walk, as the riverside streets made for a nice view of the sunset. This view could bring happiness to the saddest of souls. As I headed out the door, my little brother tugged at my jacket begging to come along. As much as I just wanted to be alone, I couldn't turn down the big brown eyes staring up at me. 
     Out the door we went, anticipating an everyday adventure for two. The cool breezy air was overwhelming, so we figured we'd make it quick. Though the darkness would soon ensue, we were far more concerned about seeing the soothing sunset. Once it was over though.. We knew we would have to rush home. That may have been our first mistake.
     The gleaming aura of the sun made for a perfect photo, so we took advantage. After snapping what could be the cover for a magazine, we swiftly set off and made way home. The streets were quite hectic at this time, seeing as everyone had recently got off work and was rushing home. We mixed into the crowd, and began to walk aimlessly. It seemed like something was overwhelming us.
     I didn't know where I was going, but I wasn't thinking about it. Corner after corner, we began to get more and more lost. We kept questioning ourselves, but would never stop. After walking to no known destination for quite some time, we stopped to sit down. By this time, we were in a not-so-nice part of town, and to make things worse he was just a kid and I was a teenager. 
     My vision began to blur, and limbs became less willing to move. My brother soon after indicated that he felt the same way. After some time, I could see nothing but the back of my eyelids. I guess I fell asleep after that, but to be honest, I don't have a damn clue. 
     Just like we fell asleep, - we woke up in sychrony. But we weren't in the same place that we fell asleep, - or so we thought at least. Skyscrapers stood as tall as the eye could see. Some odd craft that appeared similar to planes roamed the skies. 
     It goes without saying that we were both already shocked, - but the real terror came when we looked down from the skies. I let off a scream when I saw an odd creature straight off of some sci-fi conspiracy staring right at me. It made a sound  back, but it seemed to be more of a growl than a scream. My assumption was that we both scared each-other, because neither one of us knew what the hell the other was.
     I attempted to converse with whatever it was I was seeing, but my brother had other intentions. Another creature, appearing to be the female equivalent to what I was seeing, was walking something that looked like a spider on steroids. He was fascinated by whatever this thing was, but all I wanted to do was get the hell away from it. 
     The creature seemed to be friendly, but useless as far as helping us went. I tried speaking to it, but it would just reply with a shrug every time. After many failed attempts of speaking with whatever this thing was, something helpful happened. A paper fell out of it's coats pocket, appearing to be a map. I was skeptical as to if I should grab it or not. I took my chances, what's the worst that could happen, right?
     At first glance I noticed the map read New Earth. After a shriek of shock exclaimed from my person, I glanced around to make sure my surroundings were what I thought they were. When doing so, I noticed a lady sitting on the same bench me and my brother just awoke in.
     I had no clue who she was, but she was a human, and that's all I cared about. I quickly ran over to her with more speed than an Olympic track star. She, with equal confusion to my brother and I, had no clue what was going on. I showed her the map, and sure enough, she exclaimed ""New earth!?""
     By this time, whatever the hell that thing was had forgotten I snagged his map. I grabbed my brother and began walking. The map diagrammed the city perfectly. We decided to follow it to our would-be home, to see what was made of it. 
     We made way down the streets, doing the exact opposite of what we had done before, street for street, ensuring a somewhat accurate travel back to our new home in this odd world. Same as before all this happened, we started to walk rather swiftly.  Corner after corner, everything seemed to become more and more familiar. The further we got, the more humanity there was around us. 
     We were very close to our destination now. But a moment of deja-vu overwhelmed the both of us at the exact same time. Overwhelming tiredness, blurred vision, and slurred speech became imminent. We tried to press on, hoping to see our family at home instead of some odd alien creature instead. But we couldn't, and decided to once again rest on a bench.
     We slept for an unknown number of hours, and once again awoke in a different place than we fell asleep in. Only this time it was home, and thank god it was. Never have I been so happy. We ran home as fast as we could, to a worried family. They thought we'd been killed or something, we were both missing persons. They said we were gone for two years, but it all seemed to happen in a day.

"cwjymfx","Well, 9am to 7pm is 10 hours.  That's an awfully long time for a dog to hold its bladder.

The only way you can make this work is if you get a dog walker to come in to allow the dog the opportunity to use the bathroom, or to use a doggy day care.  10 hours is just too long.  Most people try to keep it below 8 hours a stretch or so.

If you're thinking about getting an actual puppy, it cannot be done.  (without getting dog walkers for every two hours) Adult dogs should be able to hold their bladders for about 8 hours (6 is preferable) but puppies cannot.

This is a significant financial burden.  You'll want to do research into how much a dog walker costs in your area or doggy day care.

Then, even though pugs are generally quite low energy, you'd have to make sure the pug is appropriately exercised and stimulated every day because so much of the day they'd be alone.  It's not a huge issue - most people's dogs sleep a vast majority of the time even if they're home, but you'd have to really make sure you can do that every day.

"cwjrwme","Basically, here's a simple rundown. There was nuclear war between USA and China, and it pretty much fried the world. All major governments were destroyed for the most part, and most people are just trying to survive in a post-apocalyptic wasteland. The war was originally started over oil, but when both the USA and China switched to fusion/nuclear power, it became more about ideology, with America being Capitalist, and China being communist. The bombs were dropped on October 23rd, 2077.

Here's a basic rundown of factions, creatures, and enemies. Since we don't know much about Fallout 4s stuff, I'm just using things from Fallout 3 and New Vegas that I know will be in 4:

**Big Factions.**

Enclave: racist, xenophobic dickwads who want to kill everyone who survived the war, except themselves. Remnants of the old U.S. Government and major corporations.

Brotherhood of Steel: Dickwads who think no one deserves the really good high tech toys except themselves. However, they can also be excellent allies, as they have almost as much pre-war knowledge as the enclave.

New California Republic: A country that follows the same principles of the old world. Democracy, rule of law and order, and bureaucracy. I doubt you'll run into them in Boston, as they are all in California (and Nevada).

Caesars Legion: Xenophobic, slave trading, yet immensely disciplined country, formed by the conquest of 87 tribes by a man who used to be part of the followers of the apocalypse. Doubtful you'll see them in Fallout 4

Followers of the Apocolypse: Anarchistic believers, who freely give knowledge, medicine, and help, in order to attempt to unite the wasteland. Probably won't be in Fallout 4, but I wouldn't be surprised if they were.

Vault Tec: Builders of the Vaults, which you start out in. However, almost every vault was designed to be some form of experiment, some cruel, some basic, some ridiculous (see vault 69). It's actually suspected that they somehow caused the Great War to happen, so they could preform their experiments.

**Creatures**

Radroach: Giant cockroach. Aren't the most aggressive, but they will attack you eventually.

Bloatflies: Giant flies that throw shit at you (I think it literally is shit...). Easy to kill, hard to be killed by, and mostly annoying.

Molerats: Giant, mutated mole rats. Can be harmful in packs, but are mostly easy to handle. Can actually be tamed and kept as pets sometimes.

Vicious Dogs: Won't be like Dogmeat... They will attack on sight (probably starving, the poor things), and like to roam in packs. Fairly easy to kill though.

Bloodflies: A new creature in Fallout 4... Not sure how dangerous they are, but they look like mutated mosquitoes... In other words, murder them hard.

Radscorpions: Giant mutated scorpions. Dangerous, and can be tough, so be careful.

Giant Ants: What it says on the package. Some even breath fire, so be careful. Hit them on the antenna to make them attack their allies

Yao Gaui: BEARS! Giant, irradiated, slightly mutated bears. They can be quite dangerous.

Deathclaws: As dangerous as they sound. If you are not 100% certain you can take on a deathclaw and win... Well, then you are screwed, as running is foolish. They were originally designed by the Enclave before the bombs fell to be super soldiers of a sort... Didn't work out.

Cazadors: Fuck these fucking things! They are like Deathclaws with wings, and they also poison you like a radscorpion! Fortunately, they probably won't be in Fallout 4...

**Enemies**

Raiders: Pretty much bandits, junkies, and slavers. Can have varying degrees of toughness, and bandit bases usually have decent loot. Some have nicer armor, some don't. It really does vary.

Super Mutants: Genetically modified from a failed experiment. Used to be united under a single being known as ""The Master"" but The Master was killed in Fallout 1, so they mostly have their own faction. Sometimes they can be friendly, but about 90% of the time, they will be hostile, and tough too.

Ghouls: People who got over irradiated, and ended mutating into essentially zombies. Feral Ghouls are easy to kill, Roamers still fairly easy, but tougher, Glowing ones are tough, and Reavers are like boss battles. PLEASE NOTE: There are, in fact, a lot of friendly, and still sane Ghouls, you can tell who they are by the amount of clothing they are wearing usually. Please be nice to them, it's not their fault they got irradiated....

Mr. Handys: Pre war specialized butlers. They can sometimes go insane and attack everything. Pretty weak and easy to kill. There are military models known as Mr. Gutsys, which are considerably tougher. Weapons are almost always flamethrowers, and plasma weapons.

Protectron: Security robots. Can range in toughness and damage. Not always hostile, depending on the environment and who is using them.

Sentrybot: Giant, military grade robots. Commonly armored, and has either a gatling gun or a gatling laser, and a missile launcher. 

PLEASE NOTE: All robots have a combat inhibitor, which can make them go crazy and attack their allies. Also, almost all robots were made by Robco.

Aliens: No, seriously, Aliens. From outer space and everything. They have been in every Fallout game so far, and concept art for them has been seen for Fallout 4 during the Fallout 4 E3 show. Usually has some of THE most powerful weapons in the game.

"cwjptg7","Poodles are one of my favorite breeds, and I think you would do well with one.  A miniature is debatable if he could keep with running, a moyen or standard definitely could.  Poodles should be mentally exercised as well as physically.  

Golden retrievers are great dogs.  They shed a lot.  Goldens are outgoing and friendly, but not as affectionate as poodles.

Another option would be a greyhound.  Sight hounds are very different from scent hounds.  Greyhounds are sweet gentle quiet dogs.  They need to stay on a leash, and will need a coat in the winter.   There is probably a greyhound rescue in your area.

"cwd8wbh","I travel a great deal, and much of that is international.  Here are some of my reviews:

The JW Marriott in Dubai is nice; has several restaurants and bars, and picks me up and drops me off at the airport in a BMW 750I - no other Marriott I have stayed at offers this.

The Rayong Marriott in Thailand is one of my favorites; very nice but secluded.  If you are looking for peace and quiet, secluded beaches and swimming pools with limited use this is your place.

The Cosmopolitan in Las Vegas is new, very nice, and on the Strip, but doesn't offer airport pickup or drop off.  Numerous restaurants and bars but $$$$$.  

The Marriott Resort just outside of Las Vegas is huge; very nice with lots of restaurants and bars, and offers a nice golf course if that is what you like.  They also have an extensive waterway with several streams and ponds (worth seeing IMO).  I stayed here because they have large parking lots and I was pulling a large enclosed trailer. 

The JW Marriott in Hanoi is new and very nice, but is not near any anything. They have a couple of nice restaurants but the staff failed to upgrade me - unlike several other Marriotts.     

The Renaissance Riverside in Saigon is nice and very friendly, but has limited bars and restaurants.  Great location and is walking distance to many attractions like clubs, restaurants, bars, professional massage, etc, etc.

The Manila Marriott failed have a room for me in spite of the fact I had pre-paid (PRE-PAID!!!!!) for the room months in advance.  Did I mention that a room I had paid for MONTHS in advance was unavailable???  

The Cebu City Marriott was nice; I will return.  They have numerous day trips available including diving with whale sharks.

"cw70n7f","There's some general tips I see floating around for getting started. From a solo player's perspective, oddly...

- **Focus**. Decide early what you're going to do. Have areas of interest. Have something unique and attractive that makes joining your guild worthwhile. Want to raid? WvW havoc? PVP arenas? Unless you're incredibly massive, you're not gonna be able to do everything so don't try.
- **Stay active**. Do guild missions, rushes, bounties, whatever. Run your own events. Keep your TS/Mumble up and running, and make sure there are people in it.
- **Give people a reason to want to join**.  Comes back to the first point a little: there are hundreds of guilds out there, why should they choose yours? What are you offering that they can't get somewhere else? A lot of guilds advertise '24/7 guild buffs' or 'friendly and helpful community', but that's just the tip of the iceberg.
- **Consider rep requirements**. Some people enjoy having multiple guilds for different purposes/areas of the game and so won't join anything that's 99/100% rep. Others are looking for that kind of commitment, so won't settle for anything less because it's not 'serious' enough. Decide what sort of people you want, and if you want to include a requirement, enforce it or you may as well not have one at all.
- **Advertise intelligently**. Don't be the guy that spams his recruitment message in LA every five minutes; people will just get irritated with you. Drop it in once every hour or two, maybe. Piggyback off world bosses and other events that might draw a crowd. Be friendly, but also professional. Adjust slider depending on your desired guild atmosphere. And for heaven's sake, be a little original. The only recruitment notices I completely ignore are the ones that just go '[RNDM] Random Guild is recruiting. We do PvP/WvW/PvE. 24/7 buffs and TS. Whisper for info.' What the hell does that tell you? Nothing! This is tying into the first few points, but for the most part, people join a guild because they want a community made up of actual people to play with. Long-time established guilds can draw recruits simply because of their name, but for a new group you're going to want to jazz it up a little bit. Be a bit funny, include some puns, whatever works for you. A silly guild name can help break the ice, but be careful not to appear too silly. Again, it comes down to how you want to be perceived.",1445384735,"a lot of guilds advertise '24/7 guild buffs' or 'friendly and helpful community', but that's just the tip of the iceberg. - **consider rep requirements**.","friendly and helpful","friendly",NA,FALSE,"friendly and helpful","helpful",NA,NA,1

Sabregirl's [Morrowind Ecology](http://mw.modhistory.com/download-26-7082) includes creatures like deer and rabbits, and generally makes the creatures of Morrowind far less hostile, modifying existing creatures to be more peaceful.

"cvtroym","SUPER belated comment, but: I'm super happy you're looking into getting a puppy!  Dog breed is super important, and I definitely think a breeder is the right decision if you're looking into getting a therapy dog.  As amazing as rescues are, it's very difficult to care for a dog with emotional problems if you yourself aren't healthy.  

With that in mind, I couldn't help but make a list of some hypoallergenic dog breeds that would well-suit your needs:
&gt; **[Miniature Schnauzer](http://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/miniature-schnauzer/) -** DEFINITELY a good choice!  Loyal, lovie, and will follow you around everywhere.  Up for anything, walks or snuggling.  Their only downside is that they are *very* territorial about their people; if you have in-laws, friends, etc., visiting, be prepared for lots of posturing and growling/aggressive barking.  They're big barkers, but do make great guard dogs.  They're protective little things!

&gt;**[Bichon Frise](http://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/bichon-frise/) -** Gentle, happy, lovie, snuggly.  The Bichon is a straight-up lap dog, with the added benefit of not shedding.  Many Bichons are therapy dogs, and they're very patient and empathetic with their people.  They will follow you everywhere, snuggling all the way.  They don't shed, so they do need regular grooming, but as an owner of a dog who needs daily brushing, I've found it to be a wonderfully healing and soothing part of my daily routine.

&gt;**[Toy Poodle](http://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/poodle/) -** Intelligent, loving, active (they need daily play or walks), LOYAL.  Poodles, as a general rule, bond with one human, *period.*  A Poodle will follow you to the ends of the earth, all while fondly looking at you like you're an idiot.  With their human, Poodles are snuggly, loving, caring little dogs, and being so smart means they're extremely empathetic, and are also good at sensing danger.  My mother had a Poodle once, and I don't think she'll ever love another dog like him.  Poodles are dogs you never forget.

&gt;**[Daisy Dog](http://www.daisydogs.com/) -** Friendly, fun, snuggly, smart.  These dogs would be my alternative to a Terrier.  Daisy Dogs aren't purebred, but a couple of my aunts and cousins have had them, and they're great dogs.  You can find more info on their website, but they're basically strategic crossbreeds of several toy breeds, with the result being a loving, friendly little dog.  They aren't barkers, but they do enjoy daily walks and can be energetic little things.  Playful and friendly, but above all, loyal and loving.

I'm sure you never asked for this LOL, but as someone who loves dogs, I thought I'd give you my 2 cents.  I personally have an extremely non-hypoallergenic Cavalier King Charles Spaniel, but I have known dogs of all these breeds extremely well, and would highly recommend all four.  In the end, it comes down to your and Katie's personal preferences.

"cvtpnn7","Sorry for the delay, but my personal opinion is lays somewhat to the middle of the issue. Developing new pharmaceuticals is way more difficult and expensive than most people realize, something like 90% of proposed molecules are cut before they even make it to stage 1 medical trials. Each stage of medical trials costs millions, and drugs still wash out if the side effects are more severe than expected, or there's unexpected interactions. So the production of drugs *is* genuinely both very expensive and somewhat risky.

That said though, the free market climate of the US has created a monster of the medical market. Insurance companies, treatment clinics, and pharma are locked in a constant war, between pharma providing ""gifts"", donations (pills and other useful items), and paying speaker fees to clinics and doctors in return for their expensive and new medication being the first option presented (and often trialed) to patients for free. Insurance companies negotiate varying rates that the company pays, which depends on their size and bargaining power, followed by hospitals and insurance companies sending bills and estimates back and forth like some kind of post-apocalyptic accounting nightmare. Doctors can perform semi-needless (or entirely needless) tests that the insurance companies are forced to pay, unless they can prove it was frivolous. Insurance companies then push for generic drugs because they're tens or hundreds of times cheaper for the same effect, but patients get screwed because they're sometimes required to trial several drugs (taking months or years) before being allowed to get a permanent prescription covered by insurance. On top of that, wages for general practitioners (just your average family doctor) are actually pretty low compared to the cost of medical school, so there's a huge incentive to specialize and open a practice that caters to very small number of specialized cases for a great deal of money.

It's so fucked, and it's so important. Even my friends going into it recognize that it has problems, but system needs an overarching change before we can even start to fix it. Notably capitalism needs to be cut out or severely regulated because terrible actions that hurt patients or the system but rake in revenue aren't punished, while patient friendly but fiscally ineffective actions are shut down, bought, or flipped. Sorry for the density of text, I don't usually let responses get this big, but this is such a big issue and I wanted to make it clear that there isn't a single bad guy in this, just a system that lends itself to exploitation, and a few assholes ruining it while everyone else is trying to keep it together and actually help.",1444401187,"notably capitalism needs to be cut out or severely regulated because terrible actions that hurt patients or the system but rake in revenue aren't punished, while patient friendly but fiscally ineffective actions are shut down, bought, or flipped.","friendly but fiscally","friendly","but",FALSE,"friendly but fiscally ineffective","ineffective",NA,"fiscally",1

"cvni37n","&gt; Do I start with languages first or with an intro course

All intro courses are going to use a language. Most people suggest Python as a first language and I agree. Python is a very nice beginner-friendly but powerful language. Don't worry too much about which language to pick, once you get the concepts down, you can learn other languages quickly.

&gt; How much time should I commit to learning?

This is a very personal question. It depends on a lot of factors. I would say at least an hour a day of uninterrupted study time, and no more than 3 hours a day of broken up study sessions. It's all very much up to you and how you learn best.

At the risk of releasing my inner Shia Labeouff, just do it! Seriously, start watching some videos. If you don't like them or can't understand them, watch some other videos.

"cvgtth0","I've been living in Japan for over five years and I'll return next spring.  Where can I even begin?  Just about everything you could think of.  I think for me though, it has to be a sense of belonging.


It's hard for me to really put it into words.  I know the PNW in general can have a vibe to it that's off putting to outsiders.  Back home, I never spent time trying to meet new people.  I can't remember one phone number I picked up from a stranger, ever.  Nor do I remember anyone asking me for mine.  Despite what many people call the Seattle Freeze, I still think there is a friendly atmosphere under the surface.  I've had my car break down on the road and people stopped to help, bartenders giving me a little extra because the keg ran out, or having a good chat with strangers on the train/ski lift/or a general store in the middle of no where.  These are just a few examples I could think of.  It's not like anyone is looking for a friend, just someone to talk/chill with and that's fine.      


In Japan, I feel like I have experienced a true Seattle freeze or whatever you may call it.  Making friends with the natives is TOUGH.  It's taking me years and I feel like this year I just finally started to make friends.  


There is a lot to ''Saving face'' here.  You'll get contact info, follow up, plan a date, and they'll drop out at the last minute.  There is a phrase or word for it but I can't recall it at the moment.  It's happened so much to me, it's disheartening.  Old people here are pretty nice and friendly but a lot of people younger than forty, I have a hard time vibing with.  It could be chalked up to just not being Japanese and people not knowing how to deal with me but plenty of them have just as hard, if not a harder time making friends.  Meeting people through friends of friends seems to only work sometimes and still has a pretty low success rate.  

The uptightness of people here is also troublesome.  This makes it sorta hard for me to be me.  Here I'm just a weirdo but in WA, normal.

"cusgpzu","Yesterday, I was walking my grey as we usually do.  We were having a particularly good walk--loose leash, right at my side, no pulling. Then, a Yorkie across a street saw us while his owner was loading a trailer. I was in the park.  The Yorkie took off, crossed a busy-ass street, and charged my dog, barking furiously. 

Here's the thing: my grey is not a gentle giant. He's 95lbs of alertness. He doesn't like children coming at his face and he doesn't like small dogs. He also doesn't like anything or anyone that comes at me fast. So when this assumably friendly but annoying dog charged him, he was bristling. I immediately walked in a circle and away from the terrier, who promptly followed. I called to the owner: ""get your dog, please!""  Of course, he yelled the dog's name several times to no avail. Finally, he walked over to grab him as my dog and I continued our walk.  

This is frustrating for me, too. Your dog could be killed because he runs to other dogs across busy streets. He could be seriously hurt because my dog will fight a dog that is threatening.

How do you figure this? And since when has dating been ""first come first serve?""

&gt;Ive been able to keep myself locked out of the friendzone but not sure if shes attracted to me or not.

And how do you know this? 

So you're plan at the moment is, based on no real evidence that she may be into you, to call dibs on her? How do you think this is going to go?

Ok all of that may have been harsh, but that is how you need to look at these things. Sure its important to be able to just jump in there and make shit happen...but not when there is a lack of rapport and she's reeling off a long term relationship. This is just bad timing man. 

What you need to do is just stick around...for now. Look at it this way, any dudes approaching her now (I'm assuming) aren't going to be very successful...and even if she dates one, it'll most likely be a rebound and short-lived. 

Be supportive and friendly but live your life. In the process, ask her out to cool functions like festivals or something like that to get her HAVING FUN. You want her to associate FUN with you, not her ex or the fact that she's still struggling with the breakup. The more you SHOW that being with you is fun, the more she'll be thinking about considering you as something more. This will be great practice for you considering your lack of experience.

Most of all, be fun and have fun. Girls gravitate to that.

"cufv7w9","I do think you're on to something here. Loco as a coach has become too friendly and close with the team members, which undermines your authority (and is amplified when a team loses). In my experience coaching, his closeness on the team would likely work much much better in the assistant coach role. A head coach, in my opinion, should be the overarching authority figure on the team. He has the final say and retains a professional relationship with the team members (friendly, but clearly not friends). He does not fraternize/socialize with them. 

However an assistant coach can easily act as sort of an intermediary. He can get away with being closer to the team members (not a complete ""friend"", but much close). Players are often more comfortable sharing information and concerns with assistants than the head coach, which I believe can help keep the team environment healthy (if the information is used correctly). Plus if the assistant coach looks to be losing authority (goofing off during scrims, etc), the Head coach can reign in the troops and lay down the law. Until he matures more and can remove himself from being ""one of the boys"" I think Loco is much more suited for an assistant role. I do think his knowledge is valuable and do not want to see him go, however I would be worried a downgrade would hurt his pride too much and he would leave on his own. 

I like what CLG did and brought in a coach from outside the game. An authority figure should serve as motivator/manager that can utilize his support staff and players to the best of their abilities.

The Sazerac - It's rye whiskey (some use cognac) with a splash of bitters and a sugar cube. The glass is rinsed with absinthe first, which gives it a sexy aroma. It's spicy. I describe it as tasting like New Orleans during Mardi Gras. 

The Sidecar - This is cognac with a half measure triple sec and a half measure of lemon juice. Make sure to ask for it with a sugared rim. That's not normal, but I find it improves the taste. 

The Vesper - This drink was invented by the author of the James Bond books, Ian Fleming. It's a martini made with three measures gin (Gordon's to be precise), one measure vodka, and a half measure of lillet (a citrus liqueur). It's served very cold. It's my go-to second cocktail. I get something fun first, but this is my standard follow up. 

French 75 - This one is fun. It's two measures champagne and one of gin, with a dash of simple syrup and lemon juice. The bitterness of the gin perfectly accentuates the sweetness of, well, everything else. It almost tastes like lemonade. Almost. 

There's a few more, but I've rambled enough. If you go to any cocktail bar, they'll know exactly how to make any of these. Don't order these at a sports bar though.

I honestly think the psychological element of trading is the biggest part. It's so huge and affects so many aspects of the process that I think I've been sort of half-intentionally ""saving it up"" for when I've gotten through more of the building blocks -- there are already little bits of psychology peppered throughout all the pieces so far.

I feel that it even affects dealing with vendors. If someone comes to the buying booth very confident, they're going to have an easier time haggling with the store than someone who's a bit more timid or quiet. Some of the most value I've gotten from cards has come from simply being positive and friendly, but assertive, sort of like how (I hope) the tone of the writing comes through.

In terms of juicy stories, that could probably be another whole episode of its own...I actually was just thinking today about this kid I met once at a GP or SCG. I have a lot of tattoos and piercings and talk really loud, so more than one Magic player has told me I intimidated them before they got to know me. I'm not sure if it was that, or my trading style, or what, but this teenager one time was just looking *so* nervous and fidgety when we were almost done trading, and I didn't get why. Then suddenly, he picks up this old foil common he had been eyeing (a Nantuko Vigilante, maybe), places it down very intensely, says ""Put this in the trade and I'll do it"" -- then crosses his arms really sharply as if I was about to scoff at the very notion and try to steamroll him.

Let me teach you a little something about life. When a friend or a loved one betrays you in a way they should never betray you the first thing you should want to do is eject that person from your life. Maybe permanently. Your wife cheated on you then pretty much treated you like yesterday's trash. Why do you want to maintain a relationship with this person? Even a friendship? She betrayed you in such a spectacular fashion. She treated you less than a friend. A friend should never betray you in the manner your wife did.

Labs are big, strong, athletic dogs with strong jaw muscles (compared to say, a standard poodle). 
Yes, they're cute and friendly, but the potential for damage is high if they got on the attack. Higher than say, a English setter or Airedale or something.

I've Worked as a dog walker and a dog daycare when I was younger. A dog running at you trying to lick your face? It looks exactly the same as a dog running at you trying to bite your face, unless you're really good at reading dog body language. Which I'm guessing most cops aren't trained for in the academy.

Similar to how a someone running over to give you a hug, could while under the influence of adrenaline, looks a LOT like someone trying to tackle you until the moment of impact.

Which is why greeting armed uniformed men who are chasing a criminal w/excited hugs, is a social faux pas, to say the least and may also get you shot.

"ct17k8w","Canada does have culture, it's just not European culture, and it's still being defined. People from outside North America like to say North Americans don't have culture, when it's just we don't have ancient culture.

Canada is a large country with lots of room, and lots of nature even in urban areas, the co-existence and understanding and even connection with nature is something that I would argue is part of the Canadian culture. Most people here are partially environmentally aware; not eco-friendly, but most of us understand what true wilderness is, and that is something that I'd say most European have absolutely no connection to. There simply isn't forests, and wildlife areas in Europe(excluding Russia) that are even comparable to Canada. 

We have national parks that are double the size of Belgium.

We also have the native situation which isn't present anywhere in Europe. When you come here you need to realize you are basically a guest here, and most Canadians find it a touchy issue to talk about because I think most of us feel bad; recent immigrant or not.

All of this affects the culture of Canada, and an immigrant would not be able to see this unless they fully immersed themselves in Canada and did ""Canadian"" past times.

We have awesome cities, but our culture and life is centred around the wilderness, even city dwellers in Toronto have cottages 7 hours up north in the middle of bear countries and will drive pick-up trucks.

I'm sorry, not ranting, or getting mad at you, just thought I'd sort've explain something about Canada that really isn't known, and it is the importance of wilderness to Canadians. And I'd argue that is a part of our culture.

Going camping, going hiking, going on trails, atving, snowmobiling, snowshoeing, cross country skiing, going on road trips(where you just drive to a remote or far off location), even hunting; can be controversial in urban areas, and just anything to do with being outside is like dug into the mindset of the majority of Canadians, and I think Europeans don't see that as culture because it is so far off from their highly developed sophisticated arts related culture.

Canada has it's own art scene that is unique to Canada, and an awesome music scence, but I'd still argue the most universal thing about Canadian culture is feeling more like you are living in the wilderness even if you are in a city,because every city is separated from eachother by vast unspoiled wilderness.

I know it's not really specific to culture just saying being connected to the outdoors but it shows in our preferences for activities, Canada has ""developed"" many different sports on it's own which is impressive for a small country so that sort've shows the outdoorsyness, and it shows in our national symbols(all of which are just wild animals), our flag is a maple leaf(again plant life), most of our famous artists were inspired by nature(the group of seven look their art up its awesome). I could go on and on and wish I wrote this more coherently but I stopped to eat like 5 times while writing this and lost my train of thought.

It's also more common to meet a Canadian who does work that would be considered ""third world"", in Canada than basically any other developed nation, that is a Canadian who works in the mining industry, forestry, or oil industry, all of these are very important to us still, and you are always guaranteed a job in any of those industries. We have an educated population so our primary sectors run much more efficiently than a lot of other countries.  But yes, a lot of Canada still has a blue collar feel to it, especially outside of all the major cities, much more so than I'd say anywhere else on Earth.

The economy is slipping in certain areas, but you will always find work here if you are versatile, and work with decent pay too. Most people are just only willing to do white collar work, so they don't take advantage of the fact Canada has a huge primary industry, that pays pretty good. You can make $500 a day planting trees, work 4 months of the year and take the rest off and live relatively comfortably, but again, most Westerners wouldn't want to do that, but there are a decent amount of Canadians who will do ""hearty"" work.

It's hard to explain, but Canada does have a culture, and as I've said, and most canadians won't realize it, a lot of it is affected by the vast size of the country.",1436748515,"most people here are partially environmentally aware; not eco-friendly, but most of us understand what true wilderness is, and that is something that i'd say most european have absolutely no connection to.","friendly, but most","friendly","but",TRUE,"friendly , but most","most",NA,NA,1

Our gazes followed hers to the sky. The gold was still there, but the white was harsh, bright, and searing. The sirens kicked into full gear, their eerie call drifting loudly over the city. The partiers filling the street slowed… stopped… and looked up.

We all understood at the same time.

There was no time to prepare. There were no plans, no last-minute heroics, and no options.

The end of the world was *now.*

Vas was the first to ask the obvious question. ""What do we do?""

His answer came in the form of a great tide of terrified screaming. The party was over. Men, women, and children swarmed in various directions in mindless terror, desperately seeking boltholes in which to hide from some great unknown but approaching destruction.

Heart pounding, I waited, and looked to Cristina - as did the rest of our makeshift squad.

She grabbed the radio and raised it close. ""What's your name, soldier?""

""Parker, sir,"" he replied, nervous. ""Ryan Parker.""

""Ryan, I'm going to need you to focus, and make every single second of the next hour count. You hear me?""

His voice quavered. ""Yes…""

""Now, you've got everything you need at your station. There are country-wide systems in place to prepare against a nuclear attack - hardened communications, bunkers, warning systems, and the like. Now all you have to do is turn them on, okay? And pester anyone you can reach to do the same. Yell at them. Lie to them. Promise them beers. It doesn't matter. Wake them up and get them active.""

""Okay,"" he replied, reassured by her calm tone. ""Sir.""

""One more thing - do you have a location for those EM bursts?""

""Um, yes, one second."" We waited, breathless. ""About two or three miles northeast of the city.""

Cristina looked up at the sky, judging. ""Alright. Send out that location data through all the emergency channels. Tell people to get as far away from there as they can."" She looked around at the streaming panicked crowds. ""And ask them to do it in an orderly fashion, if that'll make a difference.""

Even as we looked around in fear, a giant television screen on the side of one of the nearby buildings went black, pre-empted by the emergency channels - and then basic green text appeared, recounting what she'd just said.

""Alright. Let's go.""

Ethan moved closer. ""Where to? I do have a safehouse, but it's on the other side of the city.""

""What about using the vortex machine to portal back out?"" Sort-of Noah asked. ""Let's get the hell out of here.""

She shook her head. ""We'd never make it there in time. We have to find somewhere and hole up. It may blast out exotic radiation initially, so we have to avoid exposure.""

Adrenaline pushing at my senses, I grabbed her hand and started moving, trusting the others to follow. ""I know this city. Follow me.""

Navigating the rushing torrents of panicked people was the hardest part. Huge groups swarmed this way and that, desperately running after any suspected inkling of safety. Many of them saw our six accompanying soldiers and figured we had a good destination, so they started following us.

I felt on the edge of panic myself. It was hard not to broach that line, and I danced with the idea of losing it and freaking out every step of the way. My brain kept wanting to guess at potential explosion scenarios - but I had to keep telling myself that I had no idea what it would actually look like. I had to lead everyone to the safest spot I knew.

As the tall buildings of the downtown area began receding on the skyline, I knew we were nearing our destination. My panic lessened even as the sirens echoed louder in the open air. 

The thick foundations of several very large but cancelled skyscraper projects had survived many earthquakes without damage, and we turned the last corner as Cristina's radio crackled to life with a familiar voice.

""What's going on in there?"" a friendly but worried male voice asked.

""Heath?"" Cristina shouted, using one arm to speak into the radio and the other to push screaming people out of the way. ""How're you reaching us?""

""Noah Two set up a connection, and I've been working on getting into systems over there ever since,"" Heath responded. ""Everything just went crazy!""

""The First World's about to be destroyed,"" she replied loudly - and several of our accompanying soldiers looked surprised. She looked to them for a moment. ""We might survive the initial blast, but after that, the white hole won't just go away. We'll try to live through the eruption, and then make a run for the base and portal out of here.""

""*What about all these people?*"" a soldier shouted, looking around in horror.

Mothers and fathers ran past carrying their children. Cars honked loudly at one another, but none moved. Larger men pushed their way through the crowd in a state of panic. A seemingly-abandoned young girl stood on the corner and cried, but I had no way of knowing if her parents were around. Over it all, a blanket of eerie unhearing descended - the sirens, seeming to deepen their mortified whine as the last grains of sand in our hourglass drained away.

Cristina took all this in, like I did, and forced herself to look away. ""There's nothing we can do…""

""Can your Black-eyed Army help?"" Vasiliev yelled, his face temporarily conflicted with the instinctual resentment and anger he held toward her for all her long-ago tortures.

She shook her head, and then spoke at the top of her lungs just to be heard. ""Their possessed halves were always difficult to control, but the Sword hasn't been with them for quite some time. They're running on their own agenda now.""

Slowing our dogged advance through the crowds, I caught sight of the heavy metal doors to the bunker-like building foundations.

People were spilling out as quickly as they were entering - the building was full to the brim.

*No good,* I motioned to my squad.

Cristina put her radio right up to her mouth. ""Heath, do you have maps of the area we're in?""

""Already on it,"" he responded. ""You're a half-block away from -"" His words cut off as crackling interference rose to a crescendo.

*Shit!* Cristina mouthed, before pointing at the nearest building - a dilapidated housing project.

We ran.

I broke the door in with a charging shoulder impact, and we forced our way inside even as I felt an incredibly strange sensation surging *through me* like an ocean tide on its way out - it was as if space itself was stretching.

And it was. I misjudged a step and almost fell. The walls pulled away from us in a surreal semi-optical-illusion, and the ground shook with a vast kick. Wordlessly, using military hand gestures, we directed each other - and our swarm of terrified following citizens - to pull up mattresses and anything else they could find to form a makeshift fort near the building's core wall.

I crouched down behind, crushed in with dozens of other people. Cristina held my hand with a fierce white-knuckle grip, and we squeezed down as hard as we could. The makeshift wall of debris wasn't much, but I'd seen documentaries, and even just a single layer could protect from the initial lethal radiation.

The tide inside me shifted the other way suddenly, and I felt thrown against the wall by the sheer change in the elasticity of space itself.

She and I looked each other in the eyes for a moment. Was that it? Were we going to -

The ceiling and walls above suddenly grew alive with eddies of fire, and I instinctively pulled the top edge of the mattress down hard to make a seal with the wall.

A swift punch to the lungs followed, in the form of torrential winds blasting through our huddled mass. The roar was preceded only by the sound of countless windows shattering, and then a screeching note blanked out my hearing. I could see huddled families screaming, but by what light I was seeing our shadowed enclosure, I had no clear idea. I couldn't tell if the earth was shaking or whether it was the insane winds against the building, but it didn't matter - there was nothing to do but pray.

Pray - and hold on to the mattress above me. The heat in my slightly exposed hand became unbearable, and I thought I could feel my skin melting… but to let go would have been unthinkable. With my free arm, I only gripped Cristina's hand harder. She seemed to instinctively understand what was happening to me, and she tried to take whatever part of my pain she could.

A slow ebb in the maelstrom crept up on us, until a moment of true calm and silence fell.

Cristina yelled something, but I could only hear that screeching ring in my ears.

Fortunately, the huddled soldiers and families were too deep in shock to get up. The devastation was not over - it was merely changing direction.

The hurricane winds picked back up, surging back the other way to fill in the air pressure void left behind by the initial eruption. The air was still searing, but my exposed hand had gone quietly numb. I didn't dare do anything but hold on until the ghastly winds finally slowed for a second time.

"cs6c20p","Not romance just a weirdo. So I was at a bar a couple nights ago in Brooklyn and this Swedish guy approaches me and my friend. He's visiting for a couple of months for work. He seemed cool and friendly but he did that thing where even though he's talking to both of us he mostly kept maintaining eye contact with me or ""accidentally"" brushing my hand.

Anyway in the midst of conversation he randomly brings up the fact that he has a wife at home who he loves every much. He says that she is so beautiful and is a model and a commercial actress. When he says this I'm thinking 'Oh. He's just being friendly not flirting'. He shows us pictures of his hot wife for awhile (who is really hot) and keeps saying she's a blessing and how he'd never step out because there is no one else better in the world. My friend and I agreed that she was beautiful, wished him the best, and left to go to the other part of the bar because we wanted to dance a little.

So my friend and I start dancing and our Swedish friend appears out of nowhere and joins us. He starts dancing with us but then cuts in between my friend and me and starts trying to dance with me. At first it's whatever but then he whispers in my ear, ""Your body is so amazing. I want to fuck your pussy so bad and lick your butthole. I need you to kiss me.""

And I'm just confused as fuck because like this is 5 mins after he gave us this whole speech about his lovely hot wife of 5 years who he'd never step out on. Such a turn off. I said he could only kiss me on the cheek because he has a wife and as a joke while he was about to do it I said ""My friend's taking pics."" The dude literally freaked the fuck out, yelled at my friend, and hid at the other side of the bar for the rest of the night.

He was gone for awhile and then reappeared like a creep after I came out of the bathroom stall alone (unisex bathrooms). He cornered me (he's really tall) and tried to kiss me again. Begging to take me home. I brushed him off because he kept trying to put his hands around my butt and me and my friend left.

I don't get people. Like if you're going to cheat bragging about the fact that you have a lovely wife and have been married for 5 years to a chick you wanna bang is not the way to go about things. I'm so happy it happened like this because I actually thought he was nice and decent looking initially prior to him outing himself as a cheating creep whore. The weirdest part is that one of my other friends who stayed at the bar said she gave him her info because she wants to work in media and he films stuff a lot of legit movies. So this is someone I could potentially see again -__- Thank god I won't have a life in a month.

"cruu8e3","Oh I can fully understand that. I don't mind it, but it doesn't mean that I don't get completely irritated with it sometimes. I know this gets overused a lot, but the game is in Alpha, so the developers still have the rest of the Alpha and the Beta to work on performance issues. So I am making the assumption at some point that the developers are going to at least attempt to streamline performance.

I am more worried about the player base.

I've always played this game by myself. I played the mod by myself, I play the SA by myself. I have a couple hundred hours into the SA. 

Player interaction in the mod was infinitely better than it is in the stand alone. I actually used my mic in the mod, I think I've used it maybe a handful of times in the stand alone. 

In the mod, your chances of running across a friendly were much greater than they are in the stand alone. In the mod if you killed someone, you'd get at least some quality gear. A pack, some food, something to drink, and maybe a gun. If a bandit chose to kill me, there were actually benefits to killing me. In the stand alone, when I get killed on sight, I usually have nothing more than a little bit of food and maybe a lower end pack. The only real benefit to killing me was the fact that the bandit gets to say they killed me.

People are walking away from this game. Some because of the performance, some because the game play has changed, *a lot*. In the mod, I could actually run with people I had no previous interaction with and not have to constantly worry about getting shot. In the stand alone, I just don't interact. 

So what I enjoyed in the mod and in the early part of the stand alone was the player interaction. It was an unknown, but my chances of being killed on sight were 50/50. As of late, the chances of me being killed on sight are 90/10. Before when I got killed, there was some benefit to killing me. A decent pack, food, water, maybe even a scoped weapon. Now when I get killed there really is no benefit to killing me other than getting to say you killed me. I probably only have a crap hoodie with a few apples.

Hell when I played last night, I was killed on sight within about 7 minutes of being a fresh spawn. I literally had *nothing* besides what I spawned in with.

Player interaction isn't something the developers can fix. They can influence it, but if the game just turns into a huge unbalanced PvP, I'll just uninstall it. That's not why I bought the game. I won't complain though, even with paying for the Stand Alone I got plenty of play time out of it and feel like I got my money's worth.

That's why I am on the fence about it. I am still going to give it a chance to see which way it goes, I still on occasion run across another friendly but most of the time it goes Spawn in&gt; Loot somewhat unsuccessfully and have very limited supplies&gt; Get killed on sight. Why would I keep playing it? I already know the outcome. It's going to get even worse if they increase the amount of people in a server. At least I have a chance right now of avoiding a lot of people.

Description of RP Character (min. 150 words): When I first awoke in the ARK, all I felt was relief.  Relief that it wasn't over yet.  Relief that I had another chance.  Relief that I wouldn't have to deal with those backstabbers anymore.  Everytime I wake up on the beach, I hope that maybe...just maybe... this will be the time we succeed.  That last group I found acted nice and friendly, but as soon as you had something they wanted and your back was turned...not so nice anymore.  But hey, atleast I took a couple of those traitors with me.  This time will be better.  Our group will be more focused, our weapons bigger, our friendships stronger.  I will find a group that can conquer all the ARK has to offer, after all, that is the goal....right?

Character will be a sort of gun-for-hire.  One that will drift to the most powerful group that has a strong bond between them.

We have glass windows all along my store front and two large glass doors that the kids about 2-3 age range always want to push open.

"cr15qw0","The whole Bible is about God's acceptance and forgiveness of repentant sinners (2Chron. 7:14, Acts 2:38). You will not find any part of the Bible in which God accepts, loves, or forgives unrepentant sinners. They, the Bible says, are reprobate and are going to hell (Lev. 20:23, 26:30; Deut. 32:19; Ps. 5:5-6, 10:3, 11:5, 53:5, 73:20, 78:59, 106:40; Pr. 6:16-19, 22:14, Lam. 2:6; Hosea 9:15; Zech. 11:8; Mal. 1:3; Rom. 9:13; Mat. 5:22, 10:28, 13:50, 25:46; Mark 9:43-48; Rom. 6:23; 2Thess. 1:9; Rev. 20:10, 14-15).

As far as relationships, if you're talking about marriage, the Bible condemns divorce except in cases of marital unfaithfulness (Mat. 5:32). It doesn't support divorce based on one person being repentant and a believer and the other being unrepentant and an unbeliever. However, if you're a Bible-believing Christian and you get married to someone who is unrepentant and unbelieving, that is a sin (2Cor 6:14, 1Peter 3:7). But if you're already married, and neither of you were faithful at the time you became married, and one of you comes to Christ and the other doesn't, that wouldn't be grounds for divorce.

Relationships in the form of coworkers, neighbors, etc are inevitable. Christians have to live in the world, but friendship with the world is enmity with God (Jn. 17:15-18, Rom. 12:2, James 4:4, 1Peter 2:9) so you have to be civil and friendly, but you should not be friends with people who are bad influences on your faith.",1430980595,"12:2, james 4:4, 1peter 2:9) so you have to be civil and friendly, but you should not be friends with people who are bad influences on your faith.","civil and friendly","friendly",NA,FALSE,"civil and friendly","civil",NA,NA,0

"cqv2qub","I (a guy) was 21 and met a girl through a mutual friend.  This was in Germany and everyone could get into bars. She said she was 18 but she turned out months later to be 15. I didn't think it weird she was in high school because in Germany they have an extra year.  I broke up with her when I found out but I really did like her.  She was smart and friendly.  But something did seem off hence her being 15 and it made sense later.  

So basically if your guy friend knows you're 15 and he's all right with that, something is wrong with him.  

Strangely enough I met her dad and uncle and told them my age.  They looked at me funny but then we're normal and they liked me a lot.  Germans are probably more relaxed about that kind of thing though. ",1430494061,"she was smart and friendly.","smart and friendly","friendly",NA,FALSE,"smart and friendly","smart",NA,NA,0

"cquy65l","&gt;Since this is the internet, I would love to have some real feedback. How do you feel about managers at work? Is it possible to be friendly and supportive or does that make life and work difficult? I feel like they desire my friendship and at other times don't want me around. Do you have a manager who does this well? Should I stay out of anything after work? What about baby showers and such things that I am invited to?

I'm the complete opposite of the opinion others have offered. (Female here just fyi.)

All the things you are describing are big problems for me. It creates a massive clique-environment. It creates a stressful place where if you piss off the wrong person, you risk becoming the black sheep of the office. You'll feel isolated, judged, feel unable to trust anyone (especially the managers), feel unable to fairly air your problems about coworkers, feel unable to confront anyone or hold anyone accountable, feel obligated to do a lot of things you don't want to, etc and so on. Everything that happens to and around you is constantly in this battlefield of friendships and politics and whatever else. Do the people you hang out with hang out with you because they actually like you, or because being on your good side is crucial to their job? Are you really giving that person a bonus because they're a good worker, or because you enjoy hanging out with that person? Are you really demoting that person because they're a bad worker, or because they pissed off your best friend when they called them out on a failure? Etc.

It's a bad idea. Be professional. Don't get personally involved in the people that report to you. You create major biases for yourself and can make the lives of yourself and your employees incredibly difficult. You'll be convinced you can step back and be neutral, but if you really believe that you shouldn't be a manager. You can risk losing a lot of good employees, and retaining a lot of bad ones because of politics in the office.

You can be friendly. But if you *make friends*, you're inviting problems. I **strongly** believe a person's business and personal lives should be extremely separate.

I worked in an environment like this for 5-ish years. It was miserable. And I feel quite strongly that a part of the reason I was laid off was due to holding someone accountable for their poor choices when that person was BFFs with the boss. I'd have to have a gun to my head to work in a place like that again.",1430485386,"is it possible to be friendly and supportive or does that make life and work difficult?","friendly and supportive","friendly",NA,FALSE,"friendly and supportive","supportive",NA,NA,1
"cqoqdkc","I was at the front middle and through much of the show there were jackasses trying to throw everyone out of their way to get to the front. There was this little blonde cunt that was throwing 'bows, trying to get through that got taken out by security three times. 

The couple next to us were awesome and friendly, but the blonde twat forced her way up just to grab the girl next to us' hair and try and scalp her, which started a bit of a brawl. 

There were a couple others instances like that,  but the security was wonderful and made the right calls, something I've never experienced at any concert.

"cqohne2","I was in a relationship with a man who verbally and emotionally abused me. His abuse got worse as the relationship went on. He would do things like mock the fact that I battled anorexia in the past. My self esteem was complete shit at that point. I convinced myself that he was the best I could do. 

I finally found a job after months of searching. My BF dropped me off on my first day, after the the train was delayed. During my lunch break, I walk into the break room, and that's when I saw my current BF for the first time. We were both eating alone, and stealing glances, but neither of us made a move. That's when the woman who had been training me that morning walked in and introduced us. We hit it off, and exchanged numbers. 

He asked me if I wanted to come to his place to watch the Bears game on Sunday with some other co workers. I accepted. I showed up to his place on Sunday. I was the first one there, so we sat and talked for about 30 minutes. We talked about current events mostly, but it took a personal turn at one point, and I told him about my relationship troubles. 

Several other co workers arrived and we all watched the game. After the others left, I stayed behind to help him clean up. He said he didn't need any help, but I just really wanted to spend some more time with him. We ended up sitting on the couch and talking for a while. The conversation took a very sexual turn, and honestly, I kind of pushed it in that direction. We ended up making out.

My boyfriend was a dick, but I still felt bad cheating on him, so I stopped him before we went too far. I left and went back to my place. We started texting once I got home. I tried to keep it clean and friendly, but it turned sexual again. Our conversation ended with him asking me to come back to his place. I really didn't want to cheat, but I couldn't help myself. I went back to his place, and we had sex. 

I ended up breaking up with the abusive asshole the next week, and starting a new relationship with my current BF. We haven't looked back since. 

I know cheating is bad, even if he was abusive, but that's the story of how we met. ",1429990936,"i tried to keep it clean and friendly, but it turned sexual again.","clean and friendly","friendly",NA,FALSE,"clean and friendly","clean",NA,NA,0

"cpue154","I just read a lengthy blog post on this very subject! My sister and I spent last weekend dorking out over [this blog (sortinghatchats)](http://sortinghatchats.tumblr.com/thebasics), a Harry Potter Meta blog. Basically, it's built around a fan theory that everyone is represented by two sortings- a ""primary"" house, representing their motivations and a ""secondary"" house, representing their methods.  The easiest HP example is Hermione, a Gryffindor Primary/Ravenclaw secondary. There is a *lot* of thought put into the system. The entire blog is a fun, nerdy place; ideal to delve into on a quiet weekend. Highly recommend for people who enjoy Harry Potter and/or personality analysis. I love that their explanation of HP houses doesn't fall back on tired common house tropes. None of that ""Gryffindor= good, Slytherin = evil, Ravenclaw = smart, Hufflepuff = spare"" paradigm. Each house is treated frankly, thoroughly and fairly.

[Here is a link to the post they did sorting the Orphan Black clones.] (http://sortinghatchats.tumblr.com/post/108176070482/have-you-ever-sorted-the-orphan-black-clones-how) Definitely worth a read. 

Here's the tl;dr from that post in case anyone can't be bothered to click the link (but seriously, you should click that link):
 
&gt; **tl;dr**
&gt; 
&gt; **Sarah** is a Slytherin/Slytherin. Loyal and cunning, she puts her own self and people first with no qualms.  
&gt; 
&gt; **Allison, Helena, and Cosima** are all Hufflepuff Primaries, who love those they see as their kind of people. **Allison** has a forthright Gryffindor Secondary and **Cosima** an analytical Ravenclaw Secondary, while **Helena**, who has been burned too bad, hasn’t found her secondary yet. 
&gt; 
&gt; We didn’t see enough of **Tony** to confirm his Primary (we suspect Slytherin), but he’s got a gorgeous and capable Slytherin Secondary. 

And misc excerpts for characters missed in the tl;dr:

&gt; **Felix** loves living in a model of a Hufflepuff Secondary, being kind and warm, teasing and friendly — but when prompted properly, apparently, that Puff is something he can just drop. (Which makes both Felix and Sarah Slytherin/Slytherins, except that Felix likes to pretend to be a Hufflepuff and Sarah doesn’t pretend to be anything.) 

Rachel (from a separate post, link [here](http://sortinghatchats.tumblr.com/post/111208853258/i-loved-the-orphan-black-sorting-analysis-you-just))
&gt; **Rachel** is a cold primary, certainly — either a Ravenclaw or a petrifying (or petrified) Slytherin... this is a woman who doesn’t have people but who wants them so badly.

&gt; The way Rachel achieves things is, while conniving, cold, and complicated, done in advance and from a distance. She needs control; plans and power, a particularly ruthless Ravenclaw secondary... She uses her secondary like a scalpel and a noose... It is with preparation and planning that she manages to snatch Kira, and it is Sarah’s adaptive, on-her-feet Slytherin secondary that so confounds and frustrates Rachel, who does not know how to respond to that kind of power.  


Fascinating stuff, IMO.

"cp6rgxf","Introducing... YAMAS SUPER SIMPLE GUIDE FOR MAKING OCs THE YAMA WAY. I'll be referencing my old wiki page, [Yamashita Ritsu](http://bleach-rp.wikia.com/wiki/Yamashita_Ritsu) for the duration since that's the most fleshed out OC I've made.

#Step 1: Zanpakuto / Weapon

I always start with creating a character based on the weapon they use. For me, my OC's weapon is an extension of themselves and serves as a general theme for them to be based around. I created Fainarugado, Yamashita's Zanpakuto, way before I even created Yama. I knew I wanted a defense oriented weapon that wasn't a shield but was still deadly in the right circumstances. In it's infancy, lets' call it Fainarugado V1, it originally only had 1 ability and in short, it charged energy the more attacks it blocked, and then could release it all in a large energy attack. So with that, it's theme was ""Defense/Offense"" or ""Counterattacking"". I mocked up a little picture, gave it a cool fitting name (Fainarugado = Final Guard) got's it's ability figured out and I was set. This also helped to determine my OC's fighting style which should be an extension of their personality.

#Step 2: Base Traits

With my OC's weapon / Fighting Style done I was ready to move onto the OC to fit that weapon. First I thought about what kind of person would PICK that weapon. Like if Fainarugado was sitting in a shop, who would buy it? Considering it's theme of defense, and it's main ability involving blocking a lot and then counterattacking I knew my OC had to be stubborn. Giving up wouldn't be an option. To be effective with the weapon, they'd have to tough out difficult fights with hopes of using the one trump card they had. So that weaved it's way into his personality. Stubborn, Doesn't give up, steadfast. Check. 

Next, I thought about how they would act towards other people. Someone stubborn wielding a defense oriented weapon with a deadly counterattack after a long battle. With this in mind, I made Yamashita initially a little more reserved, solitary, and hard to get things out of. He would be nice up front, kind, but keeps people at arms length. Very guarded of his emotions. So even out of battle he still fits the persona of a guard as he protects himself and his feelings while also trying to protect others from getting too involved with his personal matters. Friendly but reserved when interacting with others. Check.

To fit the theme, I also made him quite protective of others, especially those weaker than him but that's kind of a given considering his theme so far. This also loops back onto his stubbornness, given that he would protect anyone from any threat even if the threat was far stronger than he.

So with that, we now have a defensive oriented fighter, who is kind to others but keeps his distance, guarding his own emotions. He vows to protect anyone, especially the weak, no matter the odds. Never gives up on a fight.

Now I'd look at those traits, and find what flaws they would cause in his personality and actions. Given his defensive oriented nature, he is not a very skilled fighter when on the attack making him lose most battles where he's forced into an offensive position. The stubbornness of him as well as his counterattack based fighting style puts him in many high risk high reward situations and even clouds his judgement at times when facing immensely stronger adversaries. He doesn't know when to run causing him to get injured regularly and have a high chance of death. His inability to open up to anyone makes finding friends hard and leaves him short on loyal allies.

Okay so now his traits are both good and bad in certain situations.

Now we have ""Guard-Type OC"". We know what kind of weapon he/she uses. We know how they fight, how they act when fighting, and how they act towards others. All of this without even making a name or even figuring out what they look like.

#Step 3: Motives (Optional)

This step is optional, and not super necessary. All that I did here is flesh out a very basic back story that explains why the OC acts the way it does.

For Yamashita I needed a reason for why he acts the way he does. A lot of it is up to you, I just pieced a general idea starting with ""He lost someone he to protected"". Given this simple 6 word phrase, I now have a sort of 'Motive' to his personality and actions. So I made up a little bit about him having a sister and how she was picked on and he was always there to protect her blah blah then he left to be a Shinigami and couldn't be around for her. She ends up dying and now Yamashita blames himself for not being there. Now we have reasons why he's reserved (so other people close to him don't get hurt) why he's stubborn (cause he can't live with losing anyone else he was supposed to protect). This whole thing also still fits with his ""Defensive"" theme Zanpakuto, since the main idea around Yams motive is to protect people. All of this is optional because hey, you can forge your own story in the RP so all this back story shit isn't SUPER important, just my opinion. All it does is add a little more depth to your OC.

#Step 4: Appearance

Now I have t figure out what this person would look like. I personally don't see this part being super important as long as it's not comical. For a strong, knight/guard like man I can't have him being a child, or a dwarf, or some nerdy kid. It needed to fit the persona. So I went in with a few things in mind. They had to be tall, at least average build, sharp features, professional, prepared. So most of those are easy to emulate such as height but what about ""Prepared"" and other less obvious things? Well, I put that into his clothing by giving him a little armor. With the little armor, it represents himself a bit more. A visual symbol of his reserved nature, and keeping his emotions guarded. Really though, this shit doesn't have to be super deep. Just a general look is fine that fits your character.

#Step 5: DONE

And with that, you've got a pretty good looking OC there. Of course your OC may evolve as things happen in the RP (mine sure did!) and they may change but that's all the fun! So don't feel restricted in what you set out in the beginning! But in my opinion, if you do stick to their base traits it makes for a more polished OC in the end.

#Step EXTRA

For some extra fun, you can try exploring some ""Story Theme's"" with your OC. I didn't plan this during Yama's creation, but far into the RP after I was comfortable with who he was. What do I mean by ""story theme""? Well.. I can't find a way to explain it right now but it's kind of like the theme of your OC's story. As it progresses through the RP that is, not backstory. I decided to base Yama's story on the quote “Beware that, when fighting monsters, you yourself do not become a monster... for when you gaze long into the abyss. The abyss gazes also into you.” so I started steering Yama in a direction that would make him more and more desperate to succeed in defeating evil and injustice. I made Yamas story about fighting so hard against evil that he lost sight of what was right and became a monster himself. Which all still ties into something he'd do given his stubborn nature.

Anyway, that's it! Hope this was helpful! Feel free to ask questions or whatever

"cooonkg","Think long and hard about what your goals are for opening your own place.  Write it out in a list.  

Are you thinking you'll make more money than you make now?  Be prepared to be disappointed.  When something goes wrong, you'll be the first person who doesn't get paid.  Labor (employees), food/beverage expenses and taxes come first.  Unless you're incredibly lucky, with a great menu, location, idea and staff, profit margins are slim.  Like, really slim.  You'll say, ""oh, but my idea is rock solid.""  Yeah, I was saying the same as you two years ago, before we opened our own place.  Margins are slim.  You need to know that going in, and really be realistic about it.      

Do you want to be your own boss?  If so, why?  Do you want to control your own schedule?  Because you'll be working more than anyone else, for many hours every day initially.  It's exhausting, and really hard with a family.  Most SOs won't understand why you're never around, and why you're always stressed.  Do you want independence in making decisions?    Because you'll be making ALL decisions.  Such as when things get tight, and you have to decide which vendor to pay first.  Or, when you find out that your best server is stealing from you, and you have to fire them. 

Will you require an investor?  Are you comfortable with them telling you how to run your place?  If not, don't get an investor.  Save up till you have enough, then add 20%, then save enough for a one year operating cushion.  You'll need it.  The new business bump only lasts so long.  It'll take a year or more to nail down local patterns.

Do you know anything about permitting, building, real estate, business plan writing, accounting, health department issues, marketing, social media, etc?  Because you'll need to become an expert in all of these areas.  The less you have to pay people to do these things for you, the less you'll need to start up and operate.  Do you know how to negotiate a lease?  Do you know about CAMs, or other fees, like property based improvement district fees?  How about insurance?  You need to start pinning these estimates down.  Will you buy a space, or rent?  Will your landlord do any tenant improvements?  Is it an existing restaurant/bar (= higher rent), or a space that will need to be converted?  What is the zoning?  Is your type of bar/restaurant even allowed there?  Do not rely on landlords to tell you this stuff.  They can lie, or mislead you to get your hard earned money.  Do you need an architect?  Who's going to design your space and concept?  Who's your market?  It might not be who you think it is.  I own a wine bar.  I can target towards millenials till my head explodes, but my bread and butter is baby boomers.  That's just the way it is.  When I designed my space, and advertising, I have to take that target market into account.  

What's your goal for COGs (cost of goods) and how will you realistically get there?  For instance, labor?  Will you need a chef?  If so, it's likely going to cost you more than you think to get a good one.  Good employees are worth more, in order to draw them from competitors, but will that higher salary fit into your budget and price structure?  

What type of manager are you?  Do you care more about making friends with your employees, or being a leader?  Can you handle putting your foot down without being an asshole, so that you command respect, and are friendly, but able to make tough decisions?  Remember, employees could give a shit less about whether you fail or succeed. They'll just move on to the next place.  That means getting rid of employees that bring you down.  

For instance, we have a server that we should not have hired.  Our assistant manager pressured us into a hiring her.  It was pretty obvious from the get go that she's a dingbat.  Other servers have tried to help train her.  But we don't have time to waste training someone (the basics).  As the owner (my husband runs operations, and I work behind the scenes, so I don't interact with employees daily), I ate lunch with my mom during a really slow period.  This girl had two other tables, and is off polishing wine glasses instead of taking our order.  Menus closed, on the table, waiting for several minutes.  I'm the owner.  If she's such a dingbat, she doesn't  know when menus are closed that people are ready to order when it's slow, what's she gonna do when it's busy?  So, I tell my husband to cut her.  At the insistence of our Assistant Mgr, he agrees to give her one more chance, and use her as backup on Valentine's Day.  Of course, she completely screws up.  She now has a choice to be demoted to busser or be fired completely.  It should have been done a week ago, but my husband is horrible about giving people second chances.  I could care less.  This is our livelihood, and you must always remember that.        

That brings me to A) never hire or partner with your friends or family.  EVER!  And, B) do not ask friends and family to invest in your business.

I ended up staying there for a two nights when traveling. I did not know about the history or demographics at all - I just saw that the hostel there was cheaper than Jerusalem and figured I would try it. 

At first it was really cool, and while I was surprised to not hear Hebrew (yes, I was that naive), I met some fun, secular, and hospitable people on my first night and never felt the slightest bit unsafe. 

Anyways, on my second day, the IDF found and killed an Arab terrorist who had planted a bomb on a Tel Aviv bus. They had a protest+, and at first I thought, ""wow - that is kind of messed up that they are protesting the death of a dude that bombed a civilian bus"", but whatever, I am in their city. Within a few minutes, there was a full-blown rage rally, with the chant of ""Al-mawt al-Yahud"" which is ""death to Jews"", and angry people passing the coffin. People were pissed like that famous angry protester meme.

So I went straight to the hostel, where some of the Europeans were leaving to go join and take pictures at the rally (!!!). Of course, they were all eager to talk about how brutal and nasty the soldiers were (naturally AFTER they had spent a few days traveling through Israel and partying in Tel Aviv) and give their own take on the situation. 

I stayed in and barely slept that night, ready to grab my backpack and attempt a parkour escape if necessary.

"co7vuu6","I know someone from Liverpool who went to Royal Holloway, and she hated it. You're probably from a completely different background and would therefore have a different opinion on it, but if you're interested in what people from Liverpool think of RH just so you have an idea of what Liverpool is like, then these are her observations I remember:

* There's lots of women, something like two third to three quarters of the student body are female students. This has pros and cons, but I imagine it depends on your preferences and situation as to whether this is tolerable.

* RH has all of the costs, especially financial, of living in London without the benefits of easy access to the London lifestyle.

* She found it excruciatingly posh. She came from a working class Liverpool Chinese family and went to a local comp, and felt extremely out of place at RH. Long story short, she felt uncomfortable and in her view was made to feel unwelcome by the student body. There was lots and lots of drama, and she really regrets choosing Holloway.

~~~

Liverpool University is a good uni, a solid red brick. History and politics are both good courses there. Liverpool itself has a lot of charm and punches above its weight culturally, but you should probably come up for a visit to check the city out just so you know what you're getting into. It's a little gritty, scruffy even, but foreigners I've shown it to think it's clean, so it's not that bad. Cost of living and access to the airport are both great. 

Probably the biggest negative and its biggest positive are the people - they're good craic, really charming and friendly, but also quite insular. The city as a whole nurses a huge chip on its collective shoulder and as a non-Scouser you have to bear in mind that you'll be seen as an outsider, especially at first, and this will affect how people treat you. It's not necessarily negative, but it means you have to be quite considerate, and it's also annoying after you've lived there for years and just not picked up the accent.

TL;DR Liverpool is great, but you need to come up and check it out before you make as big a decision as this.",1422815050,"probably the biggest negative and its biggest positive are the people - they're good craic, really charming and friendly, but also quite insular.","charming and friendly","friendly",NA,FALSE,"really charming and friendly","charming",NA,"really",0
"co7s7pm"," At one stage I was reading this and I honestly wondered if it was heading into a sexual assault.

 I'm not saying this because I'm trying to be an ass or dramatise anything but from what you've said, he was forcing himself onto you and feeling you up despite you repeatedly saying no, or not today.  I know you did things together ultimately but you did it to make *him* happy...not because it makes *you* happy. 

You're not even comfortable with what you did, can you honestly expect this to work?

 Please understand that when it comes to dating, if it is to progress, it can only progress if *both* parties have respect for each other. Much like a relationship, dating needs a mutual respect of each other's boundaries. Neither party should be made to feel uncomfortable and feel the need to do things they don't want to do.  

 **This guy has *no* respect for your boundaries.** If he did, he wouldn't have gone on to push you sexually. He may appear nice and friendly but I honestly believe he's looking to further his own agenda of sleeping with you. I even wonder does he think you being a virgin is like a trophy for him. You said that even prior to this, he was always the more sexually orientated one during conversations, even if you returned this, it isn't any reason to have to rush *anything* beyond your comfort.

 IMHO. I don't believe he's worthy of a relationship. I don't believe he *truly* has respect for you, nor do I believe you think it could work. From what you have said, I think you need to tell him you don't see it working, make it clear you aren't interested (being physically attracted to someone isn't enough for a successful relationship to work).

 From now on, you need to be sure that you are comfortable, both mentally and physically, on a date with anyone. Maybe the first one or few should be somewhere more public even. 

 I'm sorry if my comment sounds dramatic but if you were my friend in real life and you told me this, I'd be big time pissed because of his lack of respect. I wouldn't be comfortable with you meeting him again if this is how he acts when you're both alone.

(I feel like you've done a great job understanding other people and exploring the world for yourself even despite being brought up with someone who has strong views like that. It's not always easy to believe differently than your loved ones about important things.)

I find it interesting how, with a lot of homophobic people, they view male homosexuality as entirely different than female homosexuality. Like in this case, the male version is a perversion whereas the female version is deliberately breaking gender norms out of spite-- neither accurate, but totally different definitions and perceived 'reasons' for homosexuality. 

I've heard of other people who view male gayness as real (&amp; threatening to men) and female gayness as imaginary (&amp; existing for male pleasure).  But then I've heard of people who view gay men as healthy, wealthy, and friendly but gay women as ugly, perverted, and distasteful.

"cn9a5vu","My father-in-law didn't say no; he didn't say anything. In the course of a 15-minute conversation, I asked him several times, told him that his blessing would mean a lot to me and his daughter, but each time he managed to skirt the question.

In many ways that tacit disapproval has defined our (his and my) entire relationship. My wife is his elder child, and his only daughter, so it's understandable that he thinks no one in the world is good enough for her. To boot, I'm a short, pasty nerd, and both my wife and my father-in-law are tall jocks. That may sound like a trivial difference, but my father-in-law is the consummate alpha-male athlete.

My wife and I have been married nearly 10 years, and that early interaction with my father-in-law pretty much set the tone for the entire decade. We're civil with each other, and often friendly, but rarely more than that.

"cn8vdjb","I will say that, as you said yourself, it will be out of date. So I won't spent to much time on it explaining my part choice. 

The main goals for me were silence and expandability. 

* Quad-core CPU with enough power for simulators. With a simple to install and solid cooler. 
* H97 mainstream board, budget friendly. But got all the features we need. 
* RAM is RAM. Only thing that matters is capacity. 8GB is enough for gaming and everyday use. Can expand to 16GB if you fly in very detailed scenary often, but I assumed that you care a lot more about the cockpit + tools, rather then the view. 
* 256GB SSD + 1TB HDD. Don't believe you will need a lot of storage, so this should be plenty. You can always add more later. 
* R9-280 is a very good card for 1080p gaming, but even when expanding to 3 monitors it still performs very well. As far as I could find out, X-plane seems to not be that demanding on the system. 
* Budget, silenced optimized case. It's compact but everything that we got will fit without a problem. 
* 5 year warrenty, 80+ bronze, fully-modular, 620W PSU from SeaSonic. One of the best, if not the best PSU manufactuers out there. The modularity helps with cable management as you don't have to plug in cables that you don't make use of. It also got flat cables, wich makes it even easier. 
* For monitor, I decided to invest a good amount here. It's actually not easy to shop for this kinda of setup lol. There are a good amount of thin bezel monitors out there, but they are all lacking vesa mount until you start to pay a good amount. I don't understand this at all lol. Anyway, I found the [LG 23EA63V-P](http://www.lg.com/us/monitors/lg-23EA63V-P-led-monitor) wich got a vesa mount and pretty thin bezels. How-ever it's out of stock everywhere in the US. So I went with the Dell U2414H. These are ultrasharp models wich got amazing colours and as well got very thin models. You can see a picture of this in the pcpartpicker link. 
* I have to be honest here. I don't have any experience with this. I did google around and found [some information](http://wiki.x-plane.com/Chapter_2:_Getting_Acquainted_with_the_iPad/iPhone_4_Simulator), for X-Plane. Not sure if you mean this tho. 
*  Headset, I went for a very comfortable, budget friendly and solid one from Kingston. How-ever they are made by Qpad, who are making some very solid audio products. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaMi8dMWNbI) is a great review.

Unfortunately, there are not a lot of opportunities in/around Boone. I would have never left if there were. Speaking of never leaving, some students never do. Beware of the black hole that Boone can become! It's a chill environment with a lot of personality. Embrace it and let it flow.

The main highways are 321 and 421. Both a 55 mph for the most part. Don't screw around on these roads. Cops are always on them looking for speeders. Also, fog can really mess with you on these roads. I would avoid them during storms, if possible. I've been in situations where I only had 5 ft of visibility. Snow isn't really all that bad, 4WD is helpful but not necessary. Just don't get a RWD vehicle.

Housing is shit. Slumlords are a dime a dozen. You rarely feel like you are getting your money's worth, especially when you see what comps are like in bigger NC cities. If you can afford to purchase that would be you best bet. 

Locals are friendly, but most I've encountered do hard drugs. It doesn't make them bad people, just know that weirdo hour could be any time of the day.

Here is a list of cool outdoor places worth looking into: Hebron Falls, Price Lake, Snake Pit, Linville Falls, Blue Ridge Parkway (too many places to list, but the viaduct is a marvel of modern engineering).

Ski slopes are congested and the longest run only takes a couple minutes if you bomb the hill. Snow is usually shit so it's mostly man made. IMO best man made snow is at App ski where there's also a cool park, but the best runs are at Sugar.

Having said that, here are my answers:

* Senior UI consultant (essentially a front end developer)
* I'm completely self taught, and it took a genuine interest and lots of spare time working on personal projects for about 6 years (the first 4 years were mainly design/Photoshop only) before getting my first job as a front end developer. Just over a year after that I'm now in my 3rd full time position.
* I've only been at my current job for a month, and as a consultant I travel to the site of the client with about 10 other colleagues, so have been living in hotels Monday - Thursday (then working from home on Friday). As a young single person this actually works out quite well for me, and the hotels are all paid for by the company including room service. I joined the current project quite late so it's nearing the end, but we use an agile workflow, and so far my tasks have been simple one-liners and texts changes. The people are all really great and friendly but are all a fair bit older than me, overall I quite enjoy it and it hasn't been stressful so far.
* I'm based in Manchester, United Kingdom (but so far have not spend much time here) and make £45k a year (or about $70k). Hoping to move to San Francisco in the coming years though once I get a bit more experience!

This kid just kept spitting on the floor, like frequently.  He would spit every few seconds.  I asked him to stop, and he didn't seem to understand why he should have to and then spit on the floor right infront me, so I told him to stop.   He continued to do so whenever my back was turned, and when my face was facing him he would spit into his notebook instead.  I eventually called an admin to take him away because it was disturbing the entire class.  After he left I looked over at his seat and there were 2 rather large puddles of spit on either side of his desk.  I refused to touch the notebook and see what was inside that.  Apparently he was ""on something"", I think it was meth because I heard he was in rehab before for meth. Edit: apparently it was probably not meth, I guess meth makes your mouth dry.

That same kid would ask really obvious questions randomly in class too.  It would be 20 minutes into the lesson and he'd suddenly raise his hand ""what are we doing?"", and he'd ask it as if he truly did not know what was happening, like he didn't know he was in school or that we were learning.  

Edit: Another story I recall about him: One day he ""went to the bathroom"" and never came back.  The next period some of my students that got up to sharpen their pencils lingered at the window because they noticed him breaking into cars in the parking lot.   My husband used  to enjoy this kid because I'd always come with stories.

The other student I will never forget was this friendly, but shy girl.  She started off doing nothing, which was resulting in some very low grades.  So I reached out to her parent and the parent told me about some difficult things that were happening in her life.  We worked out a plan and started getting the girl to catch up in class.  This had her staying after school a couple times to catch up on the material,  within a month she changed her grade from a low F to a C, and suddenly had a solid interest in the class and material.  She would actually read the chapter ahead of time(this is unheard of in lower levels of HS math) and ask clarifying questions.  It was just really cool to see her transform from a shy student who had lost hope, to someone who enjoyed the class and worked ahead and became confident in the material.

"cmtp56n","&gt; You can probably thank the availability of sub-$40 2m rigs for that. You know, the ones everyone brags on here...

Yes, this makes it easy for unlicensed operation and the quality is not as good as an Icom or Kenwood or Yaesu, but it gets new people into the hobby, which is great.

&gt;If it weren't for the ""sub-$40 2m rigs"" many, like myself, would not have been able to afford a rig at all, which would have dissuaded us from getting our license.

Absolutely agreed. I think some hams are just annoyed that they paid $1,500 for their first 2 meter rig and feel that ""all the whipper-snappers should have to suffer like they did."" When I got my license (I am 27), I had nothing but Echolink. I am fortunate enough to be in earshot of a repeater that has *real* hams who welcomed me to the hobby. They asked me what my rig was and, afraid of being laughed at, told them I didn't have a rig and was just using Echolink. They quickly replied ""Good! That's what it's there for! Welcome to the amateur radio!""

Most everyone in the amateur community is very polite and friendly, but I hate running across the occasional ""hams"" when monitoring HF (or bouncing around on Echolink) who are complaining about digital modes, or automatic keyers, or cheap radios. They just want to talk about how much their knees hurt, and how proportional their penis size is compared to their amp and antenna. I don't believe manual CW or hybrid solid state/tube rigs should go away - I think everything has a place and there is something very elegant and satisfying about working and tuning an older transceiver. However, without adopting and accepting newer technologies as they come along, the younger community is going to lose interest, and the hobby as a whole will die off with the ham veterans in 10-20 years.

The beauty of amateur radio is that technology evolves. As it stands today (as it has always been), it is an amalgamation of ideas, failed tests, theories, and innovation. You can talk to someone on the other side of the world, send them a ""text message"", send an email, send an image, send video, get on the internet, and many more thanks to the very design and fabric of the hobby. So let's please stop being so grumpy about change and let amateur radio continue to be what it has always been, rather than trying to freeze it in whatever iteration we are most used to.

"cmog256","As a current grad student, here's some advice I wish I had taken more seriously while I was an undergrad:

(1) Your professors are friends, not enemies. Go to office hours. Professors like being engaged by their students, no matter how intimidating they might be in the lecture hall. Be kind and friendly, but don't kiss too much ass. It pays off.

(2) There is no such thing as a stupid question, nor can you participate ""too much."" You're paying for your education—your classmates aren't.

(3) When it comes time to needing an extra push for a grade/letters of recommendation/internship opportunities, the professors who know you best will be your best friends. This helped me a lot.

(4) Lastly, remember to have fun. While your classes themselves are very important, you can maximize your education by enjoying the college experience as a whole. There is a lot to experience on campus and around Austin. Enjoy these next 4/5/6/7 years!

"cmodknj","Driving across the country I found myself in a one horse town with one cafe and a general store in the Midwest. I was hungry so I stopped at the cafe.

The waitress came to my table and greeted me. She was very friendly but little did I know my nightmare was just starting.

She asked me If I wanted a coffee and i said sure- so she says I'll go get you the milk and cream... I hadn't been so insulted in a long time! The nerve! She just assumed I would put that filth in my coffee like some dirty fucking carnist!? I stopped her and said ""sorry I don't drink milk or cream, but do you have any soy milk?""

She looked at me like I was different... I felt the discrimination already. She shook her head no and went back behind the counter to talk with the other waitress.. I saw them giggling at me.

As I looked through the menu I soon realized nothing was vegan at all.  All the menu items were so barbaric. Where was I? I asked myself.

Liver and onions? What. The. Fuck.

She came back to my table. I asked if they had any tofu. Next thing I know the manager came over to my table and angrily shouted: ""get out faggot, we don't like your kind here..""

""What? I have a wife and three kids.."" I replied.

""GET OUT QUEER!"" He shouted back.

I will always remember that day.... It will haunt me forever. The discrimination we face... But I'm a fighter.

"cmo0xdk","First of all, yes, i picked out the few extreme examples to show case my point. That's how arguments work. Most of the protesters were polite and friendly, but the vocal minority are often the ones that yell the loudest. I was there when the protest was kicked put of Starbucks,  when it went in the mall, when it camped in front of Apple, when it left back to Westheimer, when it got kicked out of Starbucks again, when it went to Gallery Furniture and stood at the door, when it did the ""die in"" in front of Canyom Cafe. All the while observing and talking to citizens that weren't participating. 

And no, I know that because I did in fact follow the protest around the entire mall interacting with normal citizens. And when I say normal i mean average. If you were to take the total population of persons in the mall and compare it to the total protest attendance,  the protest would only make up a small percentage meaning that the average person at the mall was not protesting. Calling a protester non normal isn't meant as an insult nor is it encroaching on your constitutional rights. 

The problem is, the Houston protests don't ever have a clear message. That and HPD has an extremely diverse police force and a very proactive Internal Affairs. Almost all of the recent ""Police scandals"" in Houston were caught by the department itself after being tipped off. 

Just like with the protests, there are always going to be assholes that give everyone else a bad name. The same goes for cops. Cops hate crooked cops as much or more than normal citizens because they give the rest a tarnished image

As for the militarization of the police, I have one question for you.  Would you support sending our troops over seas with just pistols and tasers. A huge population has access to assault weapons and military grade equipment, it is unreasonable to expect those tasked with enforcing laws to be at a tactical disadvantage to the people they are tasked with apprehending. You want a less armed police force you first need a less armed population.  And good luck with that.

You want to make a difference?  Become educated and get a job where you can make a difference.  Using hash tags on twitter and shutting down businesses temporarily will not change anything.  Making a martyr out of a man who was shot after committing two violent felony offenses and equating their death to civil rights leaders of the mid 20th century is counter productive to your cause and a dishonor to those who died actually fighting for a cause.

1. Roaming vs space holding

3. Filtered (member language/behavior standards) vs  Unfiltered (Anything goes!)   
4. Killboard K/L focused vs not-KB K/L focused (the amount of internal heat generated over losses)

  NC.: Space holding, veteran focused, KB K/L focused.

  Nulli: Similar to NC., but less veteran focus than NC.

  Other N3 allied corps:  Varied. N3 coalitions bonds are less tight than CFC, sometimes generating more drama.

Brave: Very newbro friendly, very unconcerned about KB K/L

Test: Mostly newbro friendly, but more unfiltered in language than Brave.


&amp;nbsp;



PL: Roaming. Very veteran focused, and high K/L focus.

Waffles (PL feeder): Roaming, friendly to Newbros, somewhat K/L focus.


&amp;nbsp;



BL: Similar to PL, but more roaming, somewhat less veteran focused than PL, and somewhat less focus on KB K/L than PL.

Pizza:  Unfiltered++, somewhat roaming.

CFC:   
 Space holding, generally newbro friendly, and less concern about K/L.   
  Wide variation in alliance cultures with goons/GSF being proudly unfiltered, while some other CFC alliances are strongly filtered (ex: my alliance BLAST).

- Eve University: Very newbro friendly, non-political training corp for generalists (not only PvP).
- Red vs Blue:  Non-political, anarchic, PvP focus.

"cmiw0sy","The Millenium Falcon dropped out of hyperspace. Her engines spluttered and complained about the long gap between maintenance schedules.

""Easy, girl, you hold together till we get home,"" Han said, stroking her dashboard, ""we'll get you all fixed up then."" You don't take a smuggling ship in for repairs unless you totally trust the mechanics. The number of people Han Solo trusted could be counted on one hand, and the number of mechanics he trusted could be counted on a Wyrm's legs.

*If that port compression coil breaks we're dead, you know* Chewbacca murmured from the left-hand seat.

""Better not break.""

Han checked the sensors. ""Hey, Chewie, there's someone else here. Can you see them and see if they look dangerous?"" Please don't be Imperial, please don't be Imperial, Han thought under his breath.

*They're hailing us* said Chewbacca, *I'll put it through.*

An image of a handsome, if older, man appeared on the holoviewer. He wore a black and red Uniform and absolutely radiated authority. ""This is Captain Jean Luc Picard of the Federation vessel USS Enterprise, identify yourself."" His voice was friendly, but cautious. Han didn't trust him.

""What are Feds doing here? What will they do if they find our cargo?"" The cargo holds held crates of illegal spices. If they were boarded ... ""Chewie! Check the hyperdrive is ready for the jump to lightspeed and hide as much cargo as you can. Leave one crate out in case we get boarded.""

Chewbacca nodded an affirmative and hurried off. Han adjusted course, aiming for the hyperspace beacon, but far enough away from the Enterprise to avoid being scanned and to make boarding difficult. Maybe he could even outrun the boarding party to the beacon. No ship could catch the Falcon once she'd jumped to hyperspace; she could do 0.5 past lightspeed, after all. Just try to fly casual.

He opened his comm channel, ""Hi, Jean. This is Captain Solo of the Millenium Falcon. I'm just headed to Tatooine to see family and transport a cargo of foodstuff."" A Hutt family, that is. ""Er, how are you doing?"" Why did you say that? Han asked himself. He hated small talk.

""I'm very well, thank you,"" the hologram of Jean Luc said. ""We've been exploring the area and have made some very interesting findings recently.""

They're onto us, thought Han, how did they know? He yelled back to Chewie, ""hide the cargo! They're going to try to board us!"" His voice was calm on the comms, though, ""that's very nice. Anyway ... we, erm ...""

Three more seconds until he reached the beacon.

""We've really ... sorta ... gotta go, bye!""

Han hit the hyperspace. The engines lurched, and shuddered. There was a bang and the Falcon stayed put. ""Chewie, you okay?""

*Yes* Chewbacca shouted back. *The port compression coil is broken.*

""Well, replace it.""

*We don't have any spares. You said you'd get some after the last job.*

The comm crackled into life again, ""Are you okay?""

""Yeah, yeah,"" Han lied, ""we're fine. Just a few technical issues. That's all. We'll be on our way very soon.""

""Our scanners show that your hyperdrive is malfunctioning. Do you need any aid to repair it?""

""No, no, no... we're doing fine. Just gotta replace a compression coil I'm sure we've got a spare kicking around somewhere.""

""We can supply you with one if you don't have one.""

But at what cost? Thought Han. And isn't this a really round-about way to board the Falcon? What was their game? He did need that spare part though.

""Okay, what's your game? What are you after, Picard?""

""We're looking to help a fellow traveller,"" (Yeah, right! thought Han) ""but if you have anything you'd be willing to trade for it we'd gladly barter with you.""

They are onto us, Han thought, but what choice do we have.

""Well, unless what's in our cargo hold, I don't think that's much."" I hope Chewie got everything hidden.

""We'll discuss it later. We're bringing you in.""

---

Han and Chewbacca were met in the docking bay by Captain Picard. With him were a few people in red who Han took to be guards. A man and a woman with gold uniforms were carrying the port compression coil.

""Well,"" said Picard, ""I've never seen a ship quite like this. May I have the tour? I'll have my men do the repairs, with your consent.""

The Millenium Falcon had some exceptionally well hidden hiding places. Han thought that maybe if Picard finds too much of the cargo he could ... no, there are too many guards. Han had no choice. Oh well, even the best get boarded sometimes.

Han showed Picard the cockpit, and the engine room. He showed him the living room, and the sleeping quarters. Picard didn't once ask any awkward questions, but talked about his travels and adventures, trying to lure Han into a false sense of security. He didn't once try to check for hidden compartments, even as he walked right over them. How much does he know? Han wondered.

Finally, he showed Picard the cargo bay. It was empty, save for three crates of ""foodstuff"". A sacrifice to appease anyone who searched them and maybe keep them from looking closer.

One last bluff, ""One crate to sell to cover costs, one crate for my family and one just in case"" he explained.

Picard sniffed the air. ""Do I smell cinnamon?""

Han knew he was done.

""I haven't had proper cinnamon since I was a boy. Our replicators are terrible at proper seasoning. Makes everything taste bland. I would love some proper herbs and spices to use in my supper tonight.""

Jean Luc Picard was the strangest drugs fed Han had ever met, he decided.

""How about this? Would you be willing to trade a few packets of this for the compression coil? Does that sound fair?""

They were going to let him keep his cargo? Why would he ... ? Han saw an opportunity, though, ""Sure, sure! Here."" He opened a crate and passed some the dark, reddish brown spice over to the captain of the Federation ship.

At that point Chewbacca returned with the gold uniformed men who'd turned out to be engineers.

""You're all set and ready to go"" said one, ""I gotta say, it's a remarkable engine. Never seen anything like it. I was in heaven! Could have done with a proper tuning up, though, so we made some tweaks to make her run a little smoother.""

No one. Touched. Han's. Falcon. ""Did you now?""

*Calm down, Han*, Chewbacca interjected, seeing Han's reaction, *I was with them the whole time. They know what they're doing. I think you'll like it.*

Picard spoke up, ""Well,"" he said, ""may you travel well to Tatooine. I thank you for your trade, Captain Solo, but we had better be on our way. Good speed, to you.""

Picard left. Han undocked and flew to the beacon.

""Chewie, is this a bit more responsive then it was before?""

*They fixed up some of the wiring to the steering engines.*

""And the fuel flow?""

*The intercooler's working now. There was a part loose, but they fixed it up.*

""Okay."" Han hit engaged the hyperdrive. The engine purred, then roared, and the stars turned to streaks around the Millenium Falcon.

"cmiu5u9","Hunt's in South Portland can do some cleaning in the shop. For almost any other repair they ship it out to a third party, Mack, to do the work. I had a Canon 60D repaired that way and it worked out fine.

The other option is to have it serviced by Nikon. I recently had a broken AF-S motor on a lens serviced by Nikon and while it took longer than I would have wanted (a couple weeks) they did a good job and the repair was a lot cheaper than the replacement cost. Of course, that depends on the lens, too. *edit* Also, for common problems, Nikon will give you an instant estimate through their website before you send it in. Then you send it in and get to approve their final estimate before they do any work.

"cm3lieh","I'd rather play with someone competent and friendly but who hacked in DLC than someone that bought it all but is a giant dick. I'm sorry that it's not the most moral answer, but its hard enough finding a team of three good dudes as it is, I'm not going to play pirate police. I wish Overkill the best in not having huge profit losses from pirating, but in a coop game like this I don't think it'd be worth it to sever positive members of the community over something like this, since it directly effects my experience as a paying customer. If they lock it down so those hacks don't work in the first place then sure, but I wouldn't kick someone for it and I wouldn't support punitive action based solely on that.

"cm3iab4","A very interesting question, and I'm sure that there are as many concerned parents in the 24^th century as there are now. Let’s use PG-13 as an example, according to [this]( http://www.filmratings.com/downloads/rating_rules.pdf) “A PG-13 motion picture may go beyond the PG rating in theme, violence, nudity, sensuality, language, adult activities or other elements. […] Any drug use will initially require at least a PG-13 rating.” So there we have our criteria. 

**Theme**: The theme is still up to the author of the holo-novel, so we have no problem there.

**Violence**: This is a more complicated one. But we know already that the computer is able to identify violent situations via the “holodeck safeties”. I would imagine that any such action in a PG-13 holodeck program would result in termination of the program. Even better, they simply would not be possible. Junior wants to stab the character? Let him try, there is no sharp object to be found anywhere.

**Nudity**: The computer, by virtue of synthesizing them, and simulating their movement, knows what parts of the character are clothes. It might simply make sure that there’s always something covering certain areas.

**Sensuality**: The same goes for that.

**Language**: This is an easy one. Given the existence of a Universal Translator – Device we can infer that computers have a vast semantic knowledge of the language. That, combined with a list of banned expressions would suffice to establish a filter.

**Adult Activities**: Again, they will not be coded into the program. I imagine things like “Don’t you want to undress?” would simply not work on the computer.

**Drug Use**: The Federation would have a list of drugs somewhere in their computers anyways, to prevent or restrict their replication. So they could be blacklisted too.


Generally speaking, I’d imagine that for some programs it would simply be impossible to do too eccentric things. Even so, we have seen with Naomi Wildman and Neelix that holodeck time with parental guidance is very much a thing. For younger children I’d assume that their parents would at least be watching, if not accompanying them. They can’t just stroll into a holodeck after all, since we know that the time there is regulated. Also, I assume they can restrict how much the computer reacts to commands from the user. It might just not be possible for the child to tell the computer to change some parameters of the environment. Want snow? Fine. Want a sword? Nope.

Keep in mind, the computer has to simulate all those things. From what little we see of the holoprogramming process, it pretty much works like ""Computer, put a chair and a desk in here. And I want a character, he is eccentric, green and generally friendly, but has a hidden secret, which is ...."" The inevitable consequence: The computer *knows* what those things mean, because it has to simulate them. The level of accuracy in response to verbal commands requires the computer to have at least some understanding of context and content. So it would ""understand"" (Not neccessarily like we do, it might simply do a lookup into some sort of giant semantic database) that ""Hermione going to the bathroom is visible"" equates to ""Hermione being naked is visible"", which is not allowed for a program with such a rating.

"cly95lp","Here is the thing, Gothic 3 was not a great game but had certain positive aspects that to me are still unique to the game.

Yes it had bugs, I remember not being able to use quicksave because every ten saves or so, it would crash and corrupt the save, man was the launch bad. Yes, the plot wasn't too interesting or cohesive (still better executed than Skyrim imo) and the combat system sucked.

I have been a vocal critic of skyrim and even vocaler supporter of the first witcher game, and I still think gothic 3 did something that these other games couldn't do. It created an beautiful atmopshere in a world where I wanted to spend all my time in.

NPCs were a lot more ""alive"" than in Skyrim and felt more like persons, sure, Piranha Bytes always was great at this, and studios invest exorbitant amounts in soundtracks and graphics performance. But again, nothing came close to the atmosphere in gothic 3, everything worked together so brilliantly that I still go back to enjoy being there. (Except nordmar, fuck nordmar).

Kai Rosenkranz did a fanastic job with the music, the lighting was superb, art direction in both central europe, I mean Myrthana, and especially varant was impeccable, and together with the incredible mundane voicing of unimportant characters, it was the best I have ever seen.

Walking down to Braga at dusk, hearing soothing arabic music, seeing the clay huts, gently lit by a torch from a wandering guard, hearing haggeling merchants and getting greeted by a greedy salesman from from the east that is friendly but sketchy while he cracks a few jokes, that feeling was the most content feeling I have ever felt in a game, I was *there*, I felt the heat of the day and the cold of the night, and the people and the sand and the dust.

Other games gave me chills, they gave me extatic climaxes, they gave me the feeling of being powerful like a hero, or powerless and made me feel sobered up. But this is the one game, the only one ever, that made me feel at ease. And I will always love it for that.",1415608211,"walking down to braga at dusk, hearing soothing arabic music, seeing the clay huts, gently lit by a torch from a wandering guard, hearing haggeling merchants and getting greeted by a greedy salesman from from the east that is friendly but sketchy while he cracks a few jokes, that feeling was the most content feeling i have ever felt in a game, i was *there*, i felt the heat of the day and the cold of the night, and the people and the sand and the dust.","friendly but sketchy","friendly","but",FALSE,"friendly but sketchy","sketchy",NA,NA,1
"cly7jl5","I'll take a stab at this and see how downvoted I get...

1. I don't find kiwis cold but I've found it really hard to make a deep connection with more than 2 or 3 kiwis over the last 5 years, meanwhile I've met plenty of expats that are friendly and welcoming.  I would say more ""warm/friendly but superficial/shallow""

2. I'm not sure about dishonest, I don't see it nearly as much as the USA, but there is a certain amount of corruption that happens because nobody really wants to pay attention or do anything about it.  So I'd say it is easier to get away with while people just look the other way.  Like the ""rip off NZ"" issue.

3. Racism is everywhere (in and out of NZ). It seems to be acceptable to be a little xenophobic which is a form of racism.  Its more casual... based on a comment, rather than a hate crime or serious discrimination.

4. Yes, other countries do drink a lot as well, but I feel it is a greater problem here.  Most ""entertainment"" and activities revolve around drinking and people get pretty ugly and sometimes violent.  I haven't felt as uncomfortable in other places that someone in this thread listed as ""also drunks""  Most of my ""kiwi mates"" just want to meet up to get pissed and rarely anything else.  Walking down courtney place at 3 am makes me cringe.  Drunk children everywhere!

5. Not sure about this one... haven't had a problem in IT but I have experienced the result of the ""brain drain""

6. I actually worry a lot less about crime in NZ than back in the USA.

7. My few interactions with cops here have all be reasonable and based on a mutual respect.  This is NOT something I am used to and was refreshing.

8. Housing sucks.  There is no way around that.  ""harden up cunt"" is just sidestepping the issue.  It is probably my least favorite part of NZ.  My rent is about 2x what I would expect to pay for a similar quality of house.  The lack of a ""rental wof"" means many places are just slumlord profit factories.

9. Yea, but hard to do with the # of people vs size of land.  That being said, there are so many horrible drivers that have zero situational awareness and it is as frustrating to drive here as it was in rush hour in a major US city.  I know the new drivers tests are much more difficult, I would LOVE to see everyone required to retake them.

10. I'm not sure if they are unable or unwilling, but the kiwi attitude is ""she'll be right"" usually followed by ""lets get a beer"" so its more of avoidance or ignoring it than lack understanding.  This kind of goes back to point #1 about it being difficult to find people who want to discuss (or think about) anything more than a light hearted conversation over a pint whilst we wait for the rugby.

All of that being said, I still love NZ and enjoy living here more than where I came from.  The political and economic changes I see coming (as a result of complaency) do make me question my desire to stay here ""for ever"" but for now its all sweet as.

"clnqgp9","So, in terms of working with an artist, decide for yourself how much you're willing to spend on this project. Most single issues of comics are between 17-25 pages. In my experience, the lowest most artists on the freelance circuit are willing to accept is about 40$ per page. On here, you might talk a beginner into 20$ per page. And, hate to be a douche about it, but you get what you pay for, generally. 

For concept art, while it would probably be easier to talk people into (as it's a smaller commitment) you'd have to spend a decent amount of money on it to make it worth your trouble. A drawing might be nice to have but in comics as a business, you have to look at the art like an investment. ""Will this make it easier to sell more in the future? Will this art get people excited about my story?"" If the answer is ""maybe?"" Then it isn't worth your time. The comics industry is saturated and competitive. Friendly, but competitive. We all want to see each other succeed, but there just aren't enough customers to go around.

This can be a career for you, but it will be a tough one. Expect to make less than you would at McDonald's for the first few *years.* a big part of it is networking. Go to local conventions. Get business cards printed. Be so friendly it's a little annoying. Make sure everyone on your local circuit knows your name and remembers you fondly. *it **is** a popularity contest.* and it starts before the first issue gets published.

At this level, it's best to offer per page. Per issue is gonna be a big hit financially, and the direct ""you give me pages, I give you money"" exchange is just easier to orchestrate. 

And, finally, as I often run into beginner writers in the field who neglect this: *when you think the script is good, re-write it until there's nothing left to fix* ...then send it to an editor that you can trust to be brutally honest.

Re-writes are the best friend you'll ever have, even though they're tedious.

As far as finding people: again, conventions. There's almost always one to be found in the summer, but local libraries and community centers are good places to start looking for local conventions (other than the obvious Google)

Good luck! Keep up the good fight! Even though there's a lot of us working in comics, we're always happy to welcome another to our ranks!",1414629593,"friendly, but competitive.","friendly, but competitive","friendly","but",TRUE,"friendly , but competitive","competitive",NA,NA,1

"cl3934g","In my 10+ years of being interested in anything paranormal, cryptozoological or spiritual, this is the first time I've heard of machine elves. I believe I've encountered what may be these creatures a few other times before. The most profound being an experience with Amanita mushrooms. While awake, it's like a sedative but the real magic starts when you fall asleep.

I awoke in my dream to being suspended in the center of a massive dodecahedron, rotating in various directions every few minutes. Every time it rotated, the face that I was looking out towards became a window to a different reality. I saw things like faeries in vast meadows with a beautiful sunset, beings with giant heads but normal bodies whilst traveling on a spaceship, a volcanic world with molten creatures dripping magma and diving through an oceanic planet seeing amphibious anthropomorphic creatures swimming around the window.

After a few more rotations I suddenly started falling and dropped through the bottom face of the dodecahedron. I was then sitting and surrounded by darkness except for a slight illumination in front of me, as if lit by candlelight. I was then approached by mysterious beings holding what looked like clay or putty. I didn't sense any hostility from these beings, they seemed friendly but indifferent, like ""Hello being, welcome to the center of existence.""

One held up the putty in front of me and started to mold it. The hands looked like a child's playing with Play-Doh, forming whatever came to mind and whatever they wanted to create. I realized that it was slowly becoming a face. When it was finished, it shot upwards and as my eyes followed it went far up, up and into through the same hole in the dodecahedron I had come down from. As I looked back downwards, I was presented with the putty and just sensed that it was my turn to create a face. I pushed in the eye sockets, pulled out the ears, drew a mouth. When it came time for the nose, I remember my hands slipping and it going a little more crooked than I had wanted. When trying to correct it, a being's hands gently stopped mine and I finally heard one speak.

""There are no mistakes. Each face is different for a reason, for a different world.""

Cue an overwhelming mind and body sensation of revelation. These beings were the guardians of creation, gracious enough to allow me a peek at behind-the-scenes of all realities and dimensions encompassing what we know as life. They smiled and sent me straight back up to the dodecahedron, flying faster and faster to the top window where I passed through and finally woke up. My girlfriend at the time said she was woken up by me poking and prodding at her face and when she asked me what the hell I was doing I mumbled that ""I'm creating reality"" and then plopping back down and fell back asleep.

So maybe these were machine elves, though I never saw any cogs or machinery, save for the dodecahedron which I suppose could be perceived as a giant machine. Amanita is unlike anything I've ever done and nothing quite so, shall I say, shamanic in quality has ever come close. The entire time I felt that although I had some degree of awareness, my actions were being guided as if this was all programmed and meant to happen at an automatic pace. This was in 2008 and since then the website I ordered them from has since ceased delivery to the United States. If I ever come across them again I would love to try it once again but having a family now makes it hard to find time to myself. Not that that's negative, I just wouldn't want to worry my wife and children. Sometimes I think about how fun it was to take hallucinogenics and how I'd like to revisit but I have to maintain a grounding in this reality for the sake of those who love and depend on me.

TL;DR: Saw windows to different realities in a gigantic dodecahedron and created a face yet to be loaded with consciousness alongside mysterious beings whilst on Amanita mushrooms.",1412721809,"i didn't sense any hostility from these beings, they seemed friendly but indifferent, like ""hello being, welcome to the center of existence.""","friendly but indifferent","friendly","but",FALSE,"friendly but indifferent","indifferent",NA,NA,1

"ckyhlw0","It's a similar program.

Reason focuses on it's own built-in system (it's own soft synths and effects with some third party support). Very fairly friendly and sounds great. Very geared towards linear music creation (even with copy/pasting loops, it's still a linear arrangement).

Ableton Live is a bit more open that Reason (it uses a standard format for third part plugins, VST ... and AU on Mac). It's got a bit more of a learning curve than Reason, but is a lot more flexible. It can do some pretty amazing stuff with recorded audio. This is the program I use and will evangelize it to no end. :D But, I have friends who can't get it to it and prefer Logic, Reason or Fruity Loops. One of Ableton's strengths is it's ability to do non-linear clip-launching (you can do linear stuff too and you can record your ""performance"" from the non-linear side to the linear side).

If you are on Mac, check out GarangeBand. I think it's free? And, is like a stripped down DAW (digital audio workstation, the generic term for audio+midi recording software).

If you are on Windows, check out Reaper (it's shareware with a nag screen on startup, not crippled at all and cost like $60-ish). It's not the most user-friendly, but it's ""free-ish"" for getting started.

Also, hit up /r/wearethemusicmakers as they are usually good about more general computer based solutions than we are here. Here, we'll recommend the most synth-based solution (hence Reason and Ableton suggestions). If you are interested in recording live instruments (like your saxaphone), WATMM subreddit is a great place to start for that. Also, check out http://www.gearslutz.com/ for some more info. The Newbie forum (I'm told) is really friendly and helpful.

Edit: Not trying to push you away. Just trying to show you where the best place to get the info you want is. We're kinda focused on synths here. :D If you want to talk about specific synth gear or have general questions on how to make sounds or what kind of gear / software is best for certain sounds, this is definitely the place to ask.

"ckyh0oh","Let me elaborate on my point as succinctly as possible. I worked in LG for 7 years and then did my masters in seoul national uni. I work as a senior manager in Indian IT co in Seoul. I can speak Korean and have lots of Korean friends as well as a loving Korean GF. 
All Koreans are not cheaters, but when it comes to nationalism, they go beyond what is known as right or wrong to others. For them, doing for the country is ok even if it is cheating. 
The biggest blunder I saw was them cheating their own citizens when Sewon ferry tragedy happened in April. Before that I always felt that Korea is very safe and accident procedures are always in place. But I was flabbergasted by the response of the authorities and incompetence of rescuers including cost guard. The way govt tried to cover up by controlling the media and false reporting is eye opening. Here is a short investigative report in case u want to know more--http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1du2pG_8tk

Regarding their cheating in sports, I saw it done in 2002 Korean Football worldcup. Any one can search it on youtube. 
While studying here I realized how Koreans try to backstab other students for personal gains such as extra score or getting ahead in a job interview etc. 
At work, the sales team is largely korean and they are totally living their life on company's expense. They lie blatantly regarding future sales figures just to buy little more time to make merry. In their minds, they are not employed by a korean co so its ok to fuck them. Who cares. 
Many Koreans refuse or are very uncomfortable working under an Indian boss. I noticed that most of the crowd above 35 thinks that they are more superior than browns. Younger crowd is usually very open minded and friendly. They also notice the racism in Korean society. 
An old story from LG--Once a korean manager in LG will take the whole team to the coffee vending machine and buy coffee for all the Indians. One day my friend offered to pay but the korean manager refused by saying that since you are from a poor country, let me pay for coffee. My friend's face turned red and said that even though we are poor, we dont need American help to protect our borders. You have 600km of border with North Korea, we have thousands of land borders and coasts which we protect ourselves. After this, that Korean never bought coffee for anyone. 

Whenever I see news about India in Korean TV or Newspapers, its basically rapes and telling people not to travel alone in India. They did not even mentioned the MOM last week. 

by the way, the authorities also tried to cover up lots of mismanagement of Asian games. They prevented to be reported in media-- http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/sports/2014/09/207_165295.html

I think in general Korean people are nice and friendly but when they feel that there is an issue of nationality, they prefer to forget right and wrong.

"ckth6m5","It really depends on what city and college you will be attending, but I'm willing to bet you will be just fine.  California has lovely weather, and most of the colleges are in very friendly towns.  Everyone mentions the San Francisco Bay Area (where I live) and Los Angeles as both gay- and foreigner-friendly, but even smaller towns like Santa Cruz and Davis are great places to be gay and/or from a foreign country.

We'll talk to anyone (though this is less true in California than, say, Minnesota) and we'll be very friendly while talking.

Hello and thank you for your reply !

I received way more replies than I expected.
When I find the right candidate, I would like to assign articles in batches of 10, where I select the titles (but am open to suggestions) and you write them/input them into the site.
The rate would be $150 for each batch of 10 articles.


My idea is to give everybody a sample article to write and see which one is closer to the tone/content I have in mind.

So, the title of the article is ""How do you train 3 sports in 1 week?""
Length between 500 and 700 words, with 3-4 sentences paragraphs and titles per each paragraph.

Please refer to the articles currently on www.artoftriathlon.com for examples, tone etc.
The tone should be friendly but authoritative - as if a complete beginner asked the question to a triathlete friend or a coach.

If you want, please send your test article to guru@runningshoesguru.com - if not selected, I will not use it on the site. If it ends up being the ""winning"" article, then it will count as the first of the 10.


Thank you again!

"cko2eci","I can get into Taipei Zoo for less than $3 and the transit costs less than $10 going from Danshui.

How much do you think it costs to go to San Diego or Animal Kingdom? Taipei Zoo is affordable and genuinely fun that you can go to on the fly. You can go any day you feel like it and get a good workout just by jogging. 

I'm not a Taiwanese cuisine apologist, I'm just an everything else cuisine criticizer. French cuisine was perhaps the most underwhelming I've every experienced. The service was rude and impersonal while the food lackluster. I had a better time in London with food service than Paris, yet Parisians will spit in your face if you tell them that like it's some kind of blasphemy. Then they'll tell you to speak proper French and not Quebecois. Like wtf? I'm not Quebecois, I'm a beginner in French you dumb shit...

It's not just the food, it's the amount of arrogance and pride French people have for their cuisine, which I NEVER experienced in Taiwan. Everything is treated as is. If you don't like Chou Doufu fine, go to the night market, don't like that? Go to the local seafood place for a $10 feast of clams. 

I realize that cities outside of the capitals can be genuine and friendly, but why would I want to go there to fuck up my life savings in Euros when I could be spending NTD? The transportation is better than NA granted, but pales in comparison to how linked everything in Taiwan is. Everything in Taiwan is fast, cheap, and reliable. I got my new pair of glasses in 2 days for $40. That would have cost me close to $400 anywhere else. Electronics as well are cheaper. I can actually go to markets to find what I want instead of browsing on the internet. Now that's a good shopping experience.

"cknxdbd","[From Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilt_Chamberlain#Philadelphia_76ers_.281965.E2.80.931968.29), this is what happened the year of Wilt's first championship:

&gt;Prior to the 1966–67 NBA season, the friendly but unassertive Schayes was replaced by a familiar face, the crafty but firm Alex Hannum. In what Cherry calls a tumultuous locker room meeting, Hannum addressed several key issues he observed during the last season, several of them putting Chamberlain in an unfavorable light. Sixers forward Chet Walker testified that on several occasions, players had to pull Chamberlain and Hannum apart to prevent a fistfight. Fellow forward Billy Cunningham observed that Hannum ""never backed down"" and ""showed who was the boss"". By doing this, he won Chamberlain's respect. When emotions cooled off, Hannum pointed out to Chamberlain that he was on the same page in trying to win a title; but to pull this off, he – like his teammates – had to ""act like a man"" both on and off the court. Concerning basketball, he persuaded him to change his style of play. Loaded with several other players who could score, such as future Hall-of-Famers Hal Greer and newcomer Billy Cunningham, Hannum wanted Chamberlain to concentrate more on defense.

&gt;As a result, Chamberlain was less dominant, taking only 14% of the team's shots (in his 50.4 ppg season, it was 35.3%), but extremely efficient: he averaged a career-low 24.1 points, but he led the league in rebounds (24.2), ended third in assists (7.8), had a record breaking .683 field goal accuracy, and played strong defense. For these feats, Chamberlain earned his third MVP award. The Sixers charged their way to a then-record 68–13 season, including a record 46–4 start. In addition, the formerly egotistical Chamberlain began to praise his teammates, lauding hardworking Luke Jackson as the ""ultimate power forward"", calling Hal Greer a deadly jumpshooter, and point guard Wali Jones an excellent defender and outsider scorer. Off the court, the center invited the team to restaurants and paid the entire bill, knowing he earned 10 times more than all the others. Greer, who was considered a consummate professional and often clashed with the center because of his attitude, spoke positively of the new Chamberlain: ""You knew in a minute the Big Fella [Chamberlain] was ready to go... and everybody would follow.""",1411252418,"e2.80.931968.29), this is what happened the year of wilt's first championship:  &gt;prior to the 1966–67 nba season, the friendly but unassertive schayes was replaced by a familiar face, the crafty but firm alex hannum.","friendly but unassertive","friendly","but",FALSE,"friendly but unassertive","unassertive",NA,NA,1

&gt;

&gt;___Beef___ is a 2003 film that documents the history of [hip-hop feuds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip-hop_feud). The film's [producers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_producer) were Peter Spirer, Casey Suchan and Denis Henry Hennelly and the [executive producer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_producer) was [Quincy Jones III](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quincy_Jones_III) (QD3). It was written by Peter Alton and Peter Spirer (who also [directed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_director)), and was narrated by actor [Ving Rhames](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ving_Rhames). 

&gt;This film takes a chronological look at battles (some friendly, but many personal) dating back to rap music's infancy in the early 1980s. The notable rivalries discussed include [KRS-One](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KRS-One) vs. [MC Shan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MC_Shan), [Kool Moe Dee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kool_Moe_Dee) vs. [Busy Bee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Busy_Bee_Starski), [50 Cent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/50_Cent) vs. [Murder Inc.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_Inc.), [Tru Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tru_Life) vs. [Mobb Deep](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobb_Deep), [Common](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_(rapper\)) vs. [Ice Cube](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_Cube) &amp; [Westside Connection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westside_Connection), the break-up of legendary group [N.W.A](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N.W.A), which includes Ice Cube's abrupt departure, and the later animosty between [Dr. Dre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dr._Dre) and [Eazy-E](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eazy-E), the highly publicized [Jay-Z vs. Nas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay-Z%E2%80%93Nas_feud) rivalry and the most infamous feud of them all, [2Pac vs. The Notorious B.I.G.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Coast-West_Coast_hip_hop_rivalry). It was partly born out of producer Jones's belief that ""Beefs are killing hip-hop"". 

&gt;Many prominent hip-hop personalities such as [Russell Simmons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Simmons), [Snoop Dogg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snoop_Dogg), [Kool Moe Dee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kool_Moe_Dee), [Jay-Z](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay-Z), [KRS-One](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KRS-One), [Mack 10](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mack_10), [DMX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DMX_(rapper\)), and [Ice-T](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice-T) also participate in the film through interviews (some done for the film, as well as archived interviews from other sources, such as [MTV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MTV) and [BET](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Entertainment_Television) clips). *Beef* also features newly released performances by many musical artists.

&gt;Subsequent releases in this series include *[Beef II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beef_II)* (released 2004, also produced by Suchan and Hennelly, and narrated by actor [Keith David](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keith_David)), *[Beef 3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beef_3)* (released in 2005, narrated by [DJ Kay Slay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DJ_Kay_Slay)), and a BET series titled *[Beef: The Series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beef:_The_Series)*, which premiered in 2006. These sequels are a continuation of the original film, but cover lesser-known confrontations and developing beefs just prior to the release of each respective film. They include [LL Cool J](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LL_Cool_J) vs. [Canibus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canibus), [Ja Rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ja_Rule) vs. [DMX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DMX_(rapper\)), 50 Cent vs. [The Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Game_(rapper\)), [Lil' Flip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lil%27_Flip) vs. [T.I.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T.I.), [Nelly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelly) vs. [Chingy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chingy), and [Erick Sermon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erick_Sermon) vs. [EPMD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPMD) partner [Parrish Smith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parrish_Smith). In 2011, Spirer speculated on the possibility of a new film, suggesting he was a little tired of the ""he said/she said"" drama but he might produce further specials in future. 

&gt;Beef also features never-before seen performances by many of the film's participants and many others, plus extended portions of interviews that did not make the final cut of the film. One portion of the extended interviews features part of an interview with Nate Dogg talking about an incident that occurred around 1995 at a Dogg Pound video shoot, in which entourage members representing Ruthless Records showed up and started a big brawl with members of then-rival Death Row Records. Although Nate Dogg did not mention them by name (he however subtlety mentioned the duo's less-than-successful 1995 album *Real Brothaz*), rappers [B.G. Knocc Out](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B.G._Knocc_Out) and [Dresta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dresta) (who participated in Eazy-E's hit diss recording, Real Muthaphuckkin G's) were among the alleged participants in the fight.

"ckdxgkl","Were you correct, that she actually liked you once and you turned her down?

Arguably, you're the asshole for going there if it's true, because it's reasonable to expect that to hurt anyone's feelings. (I'm half-concerned she still has a crush on you and that's why you being a little dickish is pissing her off so much.)

Quit escalating. Don't add insult to the situation. It's correct that she shouldn't have tried to start using authority over you related to her position over something personal and friendly, but I don't blame her for not being sure of another way to try to bring order to the situation since 1. You were helping to escalate it and messing things up in an unprofessional way for both of yourselves already, and 2. You're, what, high schoolers? So it's a little understandable that she wouldn't think very thoroughly first about the boundaries between friend role and drum major role.

You should probably apologize and explain that you didn't mean to take the banter over a line that hurt her feelings, and if some of her lines do hurt your feelings too, that would be the time to bring that up. I also suggest taking the initiative and telling her you're going to take it upon yourself to no longer engage in conversations like that during band practice, because it mixes your friendly and professional roles, and you realize putting her under stress can compromise her position of authority when she's responsible for leading other people.

Basically ... yeah, pretty much anytime you participate in insults like that in what should be a professionally-behaved context, where roles besides ""friend"" should be priority, you're both assholes. In particular, since you seem to openly admit you knew she was irritated (the secondhand flipping-off) and then you started more dialogue and added insult to the situation, you really are mostly the asshole from that point onward since you already realized she was mad/flustered and then added to it, especially in front of other people she's supposed to have some authority over. It's never okay to challenge someone's authority in front of a group they need to be in charge of like that, and I wouldn't be surprised if she finds your lack of respect for that situation a legitimate reason to be very angry with you or if she considers it a huge dent in your friendship.

tl;dr Yeah, it's both of you, but when you had the opportunity to just let her get the last ~~bird~~ word in and not continue to escalate, you made yourself a little bit extra accountable for assholery by continuing the exchange that she was keeping so immature. You need to just start focusing on band practice when you're at band practice, and leave the banter for another time, or you could seriously damage your self-discipline, your role in the band, your friendship, and her leadership position.",1410307504,"it's correct that she shouldn't have tried to start using authority over you related to her position over something personal and friendly, but i don't blame her for not being sure of another way to try to bring order to the situation since 1.","personal and friendly","friendly",NA,FALSE,"personal and friendly","personal",NA,NA,0
"ck9cfq8","The UP were actually off-rotation State Troopers. One of them I chatted with had trouble with the driving test (I guess you have to hit, and maintain a certain top speed during the test, and he didn't), so he was working the SUNY system until his re-test. The dispatch officer was recovering from a leg injury.

The UP *did* do the parking enforcement too. They were fair about it, even if they knew you they'd give you the ticket, then bust your chops next time you ran into them. An overall friendly but professional police force. No complaints about how they went about their jobs.

I'm going to have to disagree with you on your fourth point though. I mentioned people breaking into other peoples dorms... here's where that come from (short version):

We're across campus in a friend's dorm playing Wii in the living room. 7 people total, light drinking, mostly bullshitting and gaming. There's some noise in one of the rooms in the suite, but we disregard it because we figure it's one of the roommates. We hear more noise in the back, little louder but definitely heavier. Someone makes a comment ""your roommate OK back there?"" and the girl who lived in the suite replied ""she's at class"". So now we're all wondering wtf that noise is, and go back there. A student (whom we all recognized) had opened the window and was in her room. He jumped through the window seconds after we hit the lights to see the entire room. Now, the girl who lives there is scared, her roommate comes back from class and is almost hysterical, and the other suitemates are worried too. We all go down to UP and file depositions against the student. They put it on file... that's it. The student never got in any trouble for it, still got to live on campus across the quad, we saw him regularly. UP advised the girls to stay away from him.

I also recommend Sterling Grove as they might not be able to target your creatures but they can still hit your enchantments.  Privileged Position does the same thing but covers all permanents and cost 5 instead of 2.  

You're going to need more creatures as even though their hexproof it won't matter if you don't draw them.  So other creatures to go along would be Bassara Tower Archer, Fleecemane Lion, Sacred Wolf, and Witchstalker.  These all cost a bit more manawise though.  

You'll also probably want some Enchantresses for card draw as well (Enchantress's Presence and Argothian Enchantress).  

There' also Hero of Iroas to make your Aura's a little more cost friendly but most of them are dirt cheap to begin with.  

Also Hexproof Auras is normally seen paired with Bant (White/Blue/Green) because of one of my favorite cards Invisible Stalker and the variety that blue allows.  But test it out and have fun!  I recommend using www.tappedout.net and replicating your deck and play testing it to see what the best mana combination as well as amounts of each card.  And don't worry about special lands, Guildgates work just fine for casual play, there's no need to get any lands that cost more than $1.00.

"cjuaib2","Starfleet Academy-Azuremyst (US Horde) has immediate openings for DPS in our second Siege of Orgrimmar 10N roster. 

*  We are openly recruiting primary mDPS and rDPS spots.

*Starfleet Academy's openings are looking for raiders at 545 minimum, 550+ preferably. All exceptional candidates, regardless of ilvl, are welcome but would not be immediately offered a progression raid spot. 
Normal Progression Raids (14/14) are Friday and Saturday 2000-2300 CST*

**Loot Rules:** Master Loot based on /roll 

**Rolling Hierarchy:** Core MS &gt; Alt MS &gt; MS Sidegrade &gt; Alt MS Sidegrade &gt; MS/Alt OS

[Starfleet Academy's WoWProgress.com page](http://www.wowprogress.com/guild/us/azuremyst/Starfleet+Academy/rating.tier16_10)

**Raid Culture**

Our needs are straightforward; Be reliable and respect our members. We're a very friendly and easy going group who wants to explore content, not babysit. Starfleet Academy has a wealth of talent (5/14H) but what makes us successful is our ability to work well together.  If you're able to play nice with others, make raid times consistently, and want to see all facets of SoO and WoD then I have no doubt you'll fit in with the rest of the gang. 

New recruits should not be surprised to find World of Logs, video performance capture, and extensive out-of-game dissection from guild and raid leadership. These resources are meant to be used as tools and are only as effective as how we use them. That being said, most of us like looking over this theorycrafting and data crunching stuff. Our members can really be a boon to developing players looking to step their game up to the next level.

**Raid Attendance**

Your attendance is instrumental in our successes so you should be able to regularly make scheduled events. We don't recruit to a bench and so we count on each member to show up and pull their weight. That being said, we do understand that real life can get in the way of your playtime. Most of us are students so we're very understanding and accommodating to any real life obligations to school/work. In the event you're unable to attend a scheduled event, all we ask that you give guild leadership at least two hours to prep our bench to replace you. A no call/no shows will immediately jeopordize your raid status.   

**Recruitment Process**
	
Unfortunately, gear doesn't directly equate to skill. We want you to demonstrate how badass you are by either submitting logs or by running with us prior to a progression run. 
If you're interested in joining a progression team, we ask that you reach out to any of the following officers with any questions:

    Guild Master: Dryrdin#1488
    Raid Leader: Emperor#1399
    Recruitment Officer: Sileniavan#1865

We are very proud of the successes shared by our raiders coming through Siege of Orgrimaar and we expect to be competitive with our Heroic and Mythic teams into the new expansion. With talent and friendship abound, I hope the above videos illustrate just how friendly but focused we are on completing content. Starfleet Academy is a fun and fair guild that offers something for everyone, specifically for the serious player who wants to have fun on a limited schedule. If you're interested in making new friends and seriously approaching content in a laid back setting, you belong with us. 

**P.S.** Raiding isn't 100% of our bag. We're also a friendly bunch that also like to explore the more casual side of things. Achievement hunting, mount farming, old-world stuff is very much a fun thing we like to do in our downtime. ++ if you're into Challenge Modes, Proving Grounds, L4D2, Hearthstone, Diablo, and Minecraft!

Bubby was friendly but pretty quiet and Captain Scott really only talked if you went out of your way to ask him questions. If you're expecting more of a ""hosted"" or interactive trip, you'll be disappointed. If you don't mind initiating conversation or just want to fish, they're fine.

Being out on a boat was *fucking fantastic*. Kauai is heavenly, and you get an amazing view of it from a few miles out on a boat.

The only other charter fishing I'd done before was giant party-boat stuff in Florida where you have fifty people, lots of chum, and lots of action. In Kauai, it was all trolling and mostly very low key. We hooked up five skipjack (which were absolutely delicious) in six hours.

We caught a glimpse of a whale and saw some flying fish. No other real wildlife, though I hear there is a bunch out there.

Also: I'm terribly jealous you're going to Kauai. My whole family were practically in mourning when our vacation was over and we had to go home. It's paradise.

Next time PFC talks back to his NCO and the NCO lets it slide, counsel the PFC for being a fuckup AND the NCO for failing to uphold good order and discipline.

You can't do much about 1SG beyond exercising your 6's open door policy liberally, but you can sure as shit counsel your PSG on your expectations yearly/quarterly and as needed when he fails to uphold them.  Don't forget the attaboys for those in your platoon that are doing good things, we as leaders forget that other side of the coin far too often.

If that doesn't get your NCOs motivated to start cracking down on your fuckups, find your worst soldier and start a patterns of misconduct discharge and/or find your worst NCO that acts least like a leader and try for a reduction board.

I'm fairly certain GTZ isn't really ran by a *company* and more so a single individual.

I mean, sure they aren't extra polite and friendly but they aren't rude either. (*in my opinion anyway*)
  
I, *personally*, don't see this as horrible customer service. **I do understand** your frustration but they've obviously dealt with a bit of fraud and that's why the policy is in place. You emailing them can't really confirm anything because well...anyone could email them and claim they were the purchaser's daughter.  
  
I know it's probably not what you're wanting to hear but I don't really see how taking 2 minutes out of your evening is really ""cutting into it"". I mean, your dad could have just gave them a time to call him, he spend all of a minute or 2 on the phone to confirm the order and **bam**, you're done.  
  
If anything he should be happy they do that to prevent fraudulent charges on his paypal account. I would rather a company call me for every purchase on my paypal account than never call and I have some ass charge a ton of crap to my account. For me, it's worth the small inconvenience.

"cjp7szd","Well, IMO, maybe a couple things and I was a bit concerned about the timelines involved.  When one is used to near immediate contact, a sudden shift of behavior indicates either an active passive front, or genuine distraction/real life issue.  Your long delay followed by 'yes' may appear passive aggressive if you played puppy dog for awhile.  She is of course going to match that time, if not longer, in expectation that you will fold and reestablish contact.  When she does make contact, stay cordial, friendly but distant; the same as any ex, but be more timely.  Your strength is in your resolve that this was the right decision; she has to now change your mind that it isn't.

I would still stick with ""thank you for making a decision I didn't want to make quite yet"". Shows both your willingness to work things out, and that you were deliberating it as well.   She will now either pursue, or she won't not that it matters to you.   (Assuming there is a social environment mix) Most importantly is that other women are watching you and how you respond to this. 

Inevitably, she will ask the 'do you miss me' question.  My basic advise is to play a bit straight and respond to an event rather than the person (i.e. I miss the fun we had at XXX).

"cjp40wd","A lot people are commenting saying ""but this is one of the friendliest places I've lived, everyone's so nice!"" and I think not understanding what the Freeze actually is. There's an article linked at the bottom of this thread that, while old, does a good job explaining it for Seattle.

It's being outwardly friendly, but inwardly exclusive.

If you go downtown and glad hand everyone in sight, you are being very friendly. This is great, I love being able to say hi to someone passing on the street without getting in a fight, like someone else commented (seriously, wut?). 

However, if the people you are being friendly with say something like ""hey, it's been fun getting to know you, let's do something sometime,"" the standard Freeze response is ""oh yeah, totally! I'll call you."" But there is no call. The next time you run into them is just a repeat of your first encounter, and same with everyone else in that category.

IMO, the critical part of the Freeze is that lack of follow-through and ""upgrading"" of acquaintance to friend.

Bellingham is a very friendly place. HOWEVER, from my experience in living in VA, CA, and now WA, it is a more difficult place to break that outer veneer of friendliness to actually become friends.

I tend to be the planner of any friends I socialize with. I find that it requires almost constant communicating to get more than 2-3 people in one place together, with the risk of last-minute flaking on plans being very high.

It sounds backwards, but one thing I do to beat the Freeze is to actually be LESS friendly. Stay with me here. If I don't want to do something or make plans with someone in my acquaintance-zone, I don't tell them I'll call them. I don't say ""yeah let's do something this weekend"" and then drop off the grid and don't pick up their calls and/or flake on their plans. That doesn't mean I'm straight up rude to people, but I avoid getting into conversations about plan-making with people I don't want to hang out with. If necessary, I'll make up an excuse about being busy or whatever.

As you may or may not know from my previous posts, we've within the last year had to replace the carpet in the dining room at $450 because the fukkers thought that was a GREAT place for a litterbox.  So they moved on recently to the fireplace room.  We just had to throw out our couch (which also cost about $450 and was maybe 3 years old - great condition except that it reeked of cat piss) and are in the process of replacing the carpet in THAT room (at another $450).

As if all that destruction weren't bad enough, the asshats are constantly getting into things they shouldn't.  We picked up mini pizzas for the kiddos tonight from Papa Murphy's and went through the ritual of each of them making their own.  Put them on a pan on the stove while the oven was preheating and then we each needed to use the restroom.  While both of us are on the throne (different thrones in different bathrooms), we hear a loud CRASH from the kitchen.  SOMEONE got up on the kitchen counter and knocked the pan - and pizzas - on the floor.

Seriously, the little fuks are lucky they're cute and we love them so much.  *Sigh*  Maybe some awesome kitty toys filled with cat ~~crack~~ nip will distract them in their determination to destroy my house, everything in it, and my sanity!

* [Kettle](http://i.imgur.com/8tdW94l.jpg) - very friendly but will nip at you if she feels you are not giving her enough attention.
* [Maus and Thomas](http://i.imgur.com/mijwm2g.jpg) - just found Thomas in the bathroom with the lid closed on top of him and his head down in the toilet and his butt hanging out.  Should have pushed him all the way in and flushed!

"cj9au6c","My uncle-by-marriage's mother was in a casual relationship with Cliff Robertson for a number of years. She ran a horse farm in East Hampton and boarded lots of celebrities' horses, including some of the Kennedy family's and various other big name stars and famous people.

My family would, several times a year, go up to the farm to visit for a week or so, and when Cliff was in town he would often invite all of us over for happy hour or dinner, or when he wasn't around, he invited us to use his beautiful pool, hot tub and sauna. He hosted us all for Thanksgiving dinner one year, and afterwards took me out in his classic car (iirc, a '64 Mustang), tearing absolute ass through the quiet streets of Sag Harbor. The man ignored all stop signs, but damn he could drive that thing like Steve McQueen. He also gave my father a pair of downhill skis with Cliff's name monogrammed on them. The bindings broke this ski season tho :(

Super nice guy, always interested in whatever conversation was going on, and always entertained my childish questions, and was generous and ""grandfatherly"". I think the best thing to describe him in a nutshell would be that he used his Oscar that he earned for ""Charly"" as a doorstop to his bathroom. Classy, humble, generous, and incredibly friendly. 

I met Roy Scheider in a cafe in the Hamptons as well (he had been at my Aunt's wedding, but I was only 4 at the time and didn't know who he was. My father I believe had a few drinks with him, and he knew my Uncle's mother), and as a 12 year old Jaws super-fan, I had to go up to him and give him my best Quint impression: ""Chief,"" I greeted him, tipping my hat. He replied, without skipping a beat, ""Quint! I thought that damn shark got you!"" and gave me a wink and a smile. That made my whole year. I remember being very sad when I heard about Cliff's and Roy's deaths. I didn't know Roy or anything, but that meeting was EVERYTHING to me for a while. I mean, this guy killed god damn JAWS and here he is indulging some obnoxious kid's imagination 30 years after the movie over a cup of coffee. Meant a lot to me. He was a nice guy too, but I was never close with him.


Peter Jennings and I threw a football together at that wedding, but I wouldn't say we were friends (because i was 4 and didn't even know who he was until shortly before he died.)

We were friends at the time, as we had the same riding coach and cared for the horses together quite often. I was young enough at the time to not register who her family was, just that she was a rich kid living in the Hamptons like all the other rich kids.

"cj98mzy","I have the perfect answer for you!  I am a pastry chef and boy, do I know how to use up egg whites!  What with all the creme brulees and other yolk-based custards I make every day, I always have buckets of egg whites in the fridge.  
For your kids: grease a casserole with spray or butter and pour in the whites.  Place this casserole inside another vessel that is big enough to hold it and fill the outside container with hot water, enough to come up the outside of the inner pan more or less to the level of the egg whites inside of it.  This is called a bain-marie.  It is probably not strictly necessary.  Anyway, cover the whites with foil, poke holes in the foil, and bake at 325 until they are set.  When I used to do Weight Watchers (boo!) I made this, chilled it, and then removed it from the casserole and chopped it up into bits and mixed it with low-fat mayo and mustard for egg salad.  If you chop it up, your kids wont see that it isn't egg-shaped.  A skin of tough, dry whites may form on the top during baking; just slice it off.  

If your kids or co-workers like pecans, try making these amazing cookies:
http://nougatt.wordpress.com/2011/07/23/pecan-cookies/
They are the easiest cookies to make!  And they happen to be gluten- and dairy-free.  But they are so so so good.  They are not keto-friendly, but they make great office snacks or gifts.

"cj3yfk5","Hello there!
Long Post ahead.

I am Peruvian and I live relatively close to the area (400km). I have to tell you a couple of important things.

TL DR is a wonderful area, that is worth a visit, but the local people have gone through horrible conflicts and are very distrustful of foreigners.

That area is wonderful, take your breath away. 

My brother organized a trip with Italian and French anthropologists, from Jaen to the *Pongo de Manseriche*, and then to the Reserved Zone ""Santiago-Comaina"". They would investigate an unfortunate incident that occurred in that area in 2009 called *""El Baguazo""*.

It is an incredible journey that will change mindsets. I would recommend going, but it's a very difficult area to access for two reasons:

- No roads, all done in slider, ""peque-peque"" or boat that only navigate once a week along the Marañon River and its tributaries.

- There is a huge suspicion and mistrust of the indigenous population Awajún to Westerners: peruvians (settlers) or foreigners (tourists, missionaries, archaeologists, anthropologists, engineers, miners.)

I'll explain why:

This is an area inhabited by Awajún, or Aguaruna (in Quechua), a proud and warrior people, who resisted the Spanish invasion and that just was integrated to Peru about 1850 as indigenous communities. In this area there are huge reserves of Gold and extenses tropical forest.

Beginning in 1992, with neoliberal reforms implemented by President Alberto Fujimori, many investment front was opened in Peru, including mining. And many areas of Peru, including the lands of the native communities was concessioned. But it still the authorization of communities was needed to allow exploitation. The called ""Social License"", *""Licencia Social""*.

In 2006, the government of Alan Garcia Perez start, apparently a left-wing cross. But when acceded to power he become an accomplished neoliberal. During his government showed his disdain for citizens, placing ahead market and investment. This attitude culminated in a famous statements ridiculing the natives, who consider many hills or rivers as gods. For him God was in heaven and the hills and rivers must be exploited and harnessed.

Adding fuel to the fire he wrote an article, *""Sindrome del Perro del Hortelano""* or ""Dog in the Manger Syndrome"", in a national newspaper, *El Comercio*; accusing the native communities and some opposition politicians to behave like the dog in the manger, who does not eat or left eating, for standing against explotation of extensive natural resources that the country has.

At this state, in June 2008, with congressional authorization, the President signed ten Supreme Decrees, approving legislation that reduced the requirements for the Social License, in order to meet conditions for establishing a free trade agreement with the USA. That is, the formalities for the mining operation was simplified.

This was taken as a threat by the Awujun. There were intenses protests, and in August 2008, Congress repealed two of the decrees. But remaining repeal of 8 other decrees. In March 2009 a committee was formed at the Congress, but apparently they were with the intention of delaying the process and not allow the repeal. Even though these decrees were declared unconstitutional by various jurists and the ""Constitution Committee"" of Congress.

With lack of response to the Goverment Executive level, the AIDASEP, the coalition of indigenous community, called for ""Amazon Strike"" on the 9th April. Major roads are blocked, navigation is prevented in some rivers and oil infrastructure in the area is taken, including the Pumping Station 6 of North Peruvian Pipeline.

For almost two months, nearly 5000 people, natives and settlers, blocking the main access road to this region, in an area called *""Curva del Diablo""*, Devil's Curve, near Bagua. Among the strikers, hundreds of Awajun veterans of Cenepa War against Ecuador.

The authorities at regional level, the Ombudsman, and the prime minister, settled negotiations to some extent and had already managed to lift the blockade, for the day June 5, 2009.

The government of Garcia, from Lima, skipping negotiations and the chain of command, same day, orders the eviction of the road by armed police. On balance, 23 policemen were killed and an undetermined number of indigenes and settlers died. News spread ""Devil's Curve"" to Pumping Station 6. Consequently the natives attacked the policemen guarding such facility and tortured, and killed nine of them. One Police's Major is still missing.

This event is ending calling ""The Baguazo."" There are documentaries about the fact. A recent one is called ""The Waiting"", [""La Espera""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHZcVIVuBqw).

The ending balances of deaths, to date is not known but round for the 200, with most in the Awajun part. There are reports indicating that the police and army threw the bodies into the river.

Incredibly, Alan Garcia declared the same June 5: ""It's already good! These people have no crown! They are not first-class citizens. 400 thousand natives can not tell 28 million Peruvians: 'You have no right to come here.' ""

Finally, between the national and international condemnation, Congress struck down on 18 July all remaining decrees. And still, Perú could sign the Free Trade Agreement with USA. 

I'm still outraged after five years, because my brother's journey I found out many of the things I write here. Even now, no one is convicted of such killings. Alan Garcia went virtually immune from such incident. Although with the popular repudiation.

For all that I have told you, is that you have to be very careful if you decided go to that area alone. I know people in Bagua that can guide you through the journey. Even, You must have permission from Awajun community leaders. if not, they don't let go or will give food or transportation services. They may even threaten your physical integrity.

Still, the area is incredible, wonderful, dazzling. The Awajun people, once you have their trust are incredibly hospitable and friendly. But with all the shit that we Westerners have thrown them, they have their misgivings.

If you're still convinced to travel, give me a PM and I could contact people in Bagua, to coordinate your trip to the area.

"cikkymh","There are 3 common methods for self service second factor - Hardware tokens, SMS One Time Passwords and Static Grid Card. 

Of these, hardware tokens are generally regarded as the most secure but least user friendly to end users and most costly to implement. 

SMS OTPs are easy to implement, relatively cheaper, user friendly but vulnerable to malware on phone scenario (especially if you also have a mobile client where your user enters his credentials). Also, SMS services are sometimes flakey and you will get crap for it instead of the Telco. 

Static grid cards are cheap, easy to implement but vulnerable to social engineering, lost card scenarios, keylogging, shoulder surfing etc as their content are NOT time sensitive - generally regarded as significantly weaker than the first 2 options.

Automated phone calls are usually used as additional verification for ""adaptive authentication"" systems but not generally part of a everyday second factor mechanism. Factors to consider would be

1) If land lines, will your clients expect to log into the web site outside of their homes/offices? 

2) If mobile - Is call roaming, IDD charges going to be an issue? Incoming SMSes are usually free when roaming but not calls.

3) Scalability - Can your phone infrastructure handle the simultaneous logins on your existing site (each simultaneous login requires 1 outgoing line - can be queued but window is short e.g. Users will be pissed if they have to wait 5 minutes for a phone call to authenticate before they can log in to your site). What about future growth? What is the limit of your PBX?

4) Security - How do you verify the person picking up the home phone is the legitimate owner of the account (vs spouse, kids, help etc)?

Hope the above helps. Oh and a freebie on the PIN mailer thing, if your clients are in your offices for the face to face during signup, it might make sense to print out and give them the PIN as part of the on-boarding process. Your clients will love this vs the ""wait a week before the fucking mail arrives and I can login"" scenario.",1404101432,"sms otps are easy to implement, relatively cheaper, user friendly but vulnerable to malware on phone scenario (especially if you also have a mobile client where your user enters his credentials).","friendly but vulnerable","friendly","but",FALSE,"friendly but vulnerable","vulnerable",NA,NA,1

"cikeddn","I think its even a little bit more than that. 

One thing I noticed in the early episodes was that everybody seems to like Skye automatically (with the exception of May, but she doesn't seem to like anybody) shortly after meeting her. Even when she's copping an attitude and talking back to people who otherwise have no reason to tolerate it, she tends to get off easy and occassionally they even take her seriously. Coulson treats her like a daughter, Ward treated her like a little sis then later an object of desire, and even May gets all motherly and protective of her. And you can somewhat wave that away with the whole ""this team is a family"" bit, but it almost feels like they don't treat her as an adult but moreso a child whilst still trusting her with adult responsibilities. 

Also seems like she would often be the person coming up with the solutions to that weeks' problem when the rest of her very competent and *experienced* team would be at a loss. Although I would have to go back through the episodes to confirm she did this more than the rest. I just remember a lot of times where the team wouldn't know what to do and she'd say ""Well if I hack X and do Y, we can locate Z and win!""

The hacking thing I was willing to give her because that's her 'thing' (especially if it turns out to be a superpower) but she has been made proficient at everything she does. Like, she's also now a completely capable field agent despite not going through the academy, and yet neither Fitz nor Simmons gets that sort of treatment. That is, they're *actual* SHIELD agents for most of the series and don't get the kind of personal attention Skye does in improver her abilities. Just one of those things that makes her seem 'special' for little apparent reason. They don't bother training Fitzsimmons in the basics of combat.

This might just be me, but I always thought her character design was bland, as well. I mean, if you were [shown a photo](http://img2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20130514171051/marvelmovies/images/9/95/Skye_Agents_of_SHIELD.jpg) of Skye not knowing her already, would you be able to guess what type of character/person she was? She strikes me as a nondescript everywoman with a pretty face. Not exactly memorable. And her early characterization was similar. ""She's really smart, but not socially awkward or oblivious, she's good at fighting but not too detached or angry, she's really nice and friendly but not naive or sensitive, she's mysterious but not all dark and broody."" For a while it wasn't evident that she had any character flaws.

Also, I got unreasonably annoyed when her [hair was perfectly styled](http://thisfangirlsperspective.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/agents-of-shield-skye-bed.png) after she's been lying in bed after being shot and brought back to life. Like the Bus apparently has a fully stocked Salon and stylist on board.

I dunno, its just that up until she took two shots in the gut the writers seemed to just be treating her *better* than all the other characters. Even afterwards... I think its just what happens when one of your main characters is also a designated macguffin.

And I still like the character, generally.

"cikdxn6","Longtime NJ transplant here.

Austin will never be NY, so don't make the mistake that I did and constantly compare the two. For the first 2 years I lived here, I was really shitty about everything. I went out of my way to shit on to make myself feel better (though it had the opposite effect). Now almost 10 years in, Austin is my home because I've accepted what it--a nice little city with a lot of city pride.

Beer is probably your best bet. When I moved here from the Philly area, I was seriously disappointed in the beer scene, but it's exploded in the last 4-5 years. I'm not that into it, but there are tons of bars you'd probably really like. I *heartily* recommend [Whip In](http://www.yelp.com/biz/whip-in-austin) in South Austin. 

Don't be afraid to talk to people or join groups. I'm not that good at stuff like that, but I know enough to know that almost everyone here is very welcoming and friendly.

But honestly, what keeps me here is the landscape. I love Hill Country. It's getting a bit hot (don't fuck around with the heat), but when you can, go hiking at Enchanted Rock, Pedernales Falls, the Greenbelt. Bring a six-pack into Krause Springs and drink a few while gazing at the waterfall.

All in all, I'm glad I stayed, but the pull to the northeast will always be there. This is my home, but honestly only partly. Two-thirds of my memories took place 2,000 miles away. All of my family and friends I grew up with are up there and every year, we're a little more distant. It's a struggle, but it's all good.

"ciazc0k","Had this happen at a job with a party department where you could order balloons. Of course, 90% of customers showed up last minute instead of calling or placing a large order. We had a small group of people who worked that department, but would hop on cashier during busy times (holidays and sales, mainly). There was an older woman who was promoted to that department, and a cashier who was assigned to work as her assistant and help cover evening and weekend shifts. Around the same time, the company had a huge upset; the store manager was fired after sexually harassing several of my male colleagues and a new manager was brought in. She didn't get along with the party manager very well, and their personalities clashed; one was a straight-laced corporate type, and the other was a boistrous and friendly but more casual woman. 

Leading up to Halloween, which starts off the busiest time for our store, the tension increased after Party manager refused to show up at 6 am for newly announced meetings; and when she did it was with a hangover and grumpy as hell. She was good at what she did, her efforts had significantly improved her department, but she did not like the manager's new changes at all. So, after taking all of her vacation around Thanksgiving (usually a big no-no), she simply stopped showing up. Bad! Her assistant was in high school, so NO ONE was there to run the balloons desk before 4 pm on weekdays. So the assistant managers, along with whoever wasn't on a cash register, would attempt to cover the shifts. This failed miserably, and the poor assistant ended up being scheduled 4 to close all week and double shifts on weekends. Again, she was a high school student like me, and we made like $6.25/hr because we were SUPPOSED to work part time as cashiers. She suddenly has to run a department and work way more than part time hours just to keep up. Eventually she cracks, and tells them she can't work the hours, and needs certain weeknights off for other obligations. She's under 18, so they can't really force her to work more than 30 hours. 

Now it gets really bad. They toss whoever isn't running the returns desk/first register back to party, which means a bunch of untrained cashiers get to attempt to make dozens of pre-ordered balloon bouquets along with any walk-in requests. It gets chaotic. People don't know how big to make the balloons before they burst, so we end up with boquets with a mix of half-filled and full balloons haphazardly stuffed into bags. Luckily I'd been trained by awesome Party manager, and would try to show my newer co-workers the ropes, but I only worked a few days a week. Sometimes I'd come in and there'd be an entire day's worth of orders sitting untouched, along with orders missing information and some that had not been pre-paid (we required all balloons to be paid for before blowing them up, normally you'd staple the reciept to the bag with order instructions on it). Sometimes I'd make up an order, and no one would show up to claim it before closing. With no contact number, it just went to waste. Other times, people just walked out with their orders without paying. Unless someone knew that they hadn't prepaid, there was no reason to stop them on their way out. 

It reached boiling point in the weeks leading up to Christmas. We have all but one cash register running weekday evenings and all day Saturday and Sunday. Most of the cashiers are semi-new seasonal hires, who have been told to stay put on register unless a manager lets them off for break or shift change. There's no extra people to cover balloons, and the assistant is stuck on register like the rest. She's put on the second to last register, 10 feet from the balloons desk. She jumps back and forth as people come by to have balloons made, and an assistant manager covering the front does pre-orders when she can. One incredibly busy Saturday afternoon, I'm on register just down from the party assistant and we all have lines of 4 or more people. Customers are cranky, it's getting close to Christmas and they're annoyed at having to wait 20 minutes or more to get checked out. In the midst of all this chaos, a man comes by the balloon desk unnoticed by any of us. He stands there and decides what he wants, then starts looking around for the employee to help him. The assistant manager spots him and calls party assistant at her register to tell her to hop off once her line is gone. Well, there's not really a way for us to indicate that we're closed, and her line just keeps growing. The rest of us have lines too, so we can't call over anyone to give her a chance to get away. The balloon customer is getting frustrated with waiting (it hasn't been more than 10 min at this point), and starts yelling over at whoever is closest to the desk. They calmly explain that the balloons person is currently on register, and point to her. Bad. Now he assumes she's just on register to annoy and ignore him, and he proceeds to start yelling angrily and DEMANDING to get his order. He's blaming the poor party assistant personally, and she finally breaks down. She's crying as she tries to explain that she needs to stay on register until the lines go down, but he's not having it. Someone in her line tells the man to calm down and back off, it's not her fault. The people in her line graciously go to other lines, and the assistant manager finally comes back from whatever she needed to do and begins apologizing profusely. This guy is now yelling at an elderly manager and a 16 year old girl, who try to figure out what he wants so he stops making a scene at the front of the store. He calms down, they go to the balloons desk, and he walks out a few minutes later in a much better mood. Turns out his wife was in the hospital, and he wanted balloons to take when he visited her. Once they actually started making his order, he apologized for getting upset and thanked them for helping out. Whatever dude, you might be having a shitty day, but you just made a poor girl cry because you couldn't wait like an adult. 

After the holidays, things calmed down quite a bit, but the situation with the party department was never resolved. They didn't hire another full-time party manager, just moved another high school age cashier to the department and gave up on the upgrades started by the previous manager. I left after graduating high school, and less than 6 months later the place was closed down and sold off to a competitor. I had no doubt that the terrible management was a huge factor in their bankruptcy.

Other of you complains are how many dungeons are avalible? Come the game has 2 months and you have 16 dungeons, 6 VR dungeons, 2 raids and in one week you get a new VR12 dungeon. How the fuck can someone complain about that in a just launched mmo?

Anything that has ever scared the life out of you? *my friend Breanna (mentioned earlier) and I used to love about 10 houses from each other when we were young. At night, we would always walk each other half way home cause we'd be nervous, cause we lived in a bad neighbourhood. Whenever a car would drive past, we'd walk into the nearest driveway in case the person stopped, so we could run to the door. Well one night we did just that, and the person started rolling down their window, so we ran. The whole thing lasted probably 40 seconds tops, but it felt like a good 10 minutes. We were running from her house to mine, screaming at the top of our lungs, and the car was speeding next to us, trying to cut us off of running. I lived in a town house with lots of steps leading up to the front door, and by the time we made it to the bottom of the steps, my mom was standing at the door so scared she was shaking. We ran up the steps and his behind her, and it turns out it was this guys daughter that we knew. He was always really nice to us, and his daughter was dropping him off at his house. When we walked up into the driveway, it was his driveway, and the daughter somehow thought that we had been robbing him, even though he was yelling at her the whole time to stop. Needless to say, my mom gave the daughter shit, and the next month good-ol' Vince's house was for sale. I always felt bad after that because it's not his fault that his daughter thinks that two 10 year olds could be robbing his house.*

"chx07pb","Okay, story time (throwaway because she still has my phone number):


I was in a college course with a bunch of other technical writing majors, and we were paired into four groups of five. I know, a gay guy with an English major, I'm a walking cliché. In any case, my group seemed pretty standard: Three girls, one guy, and me. We all got along, worked together well, and managed to get some excellent work done on all our presentations and projects. I took the lead, mainly because I'm extremely intuitive with technology, and our assignments were focused on creating knowledge bases and consumer tutorials for obscure programs. The first half of the fourteen week course went great, and we were all acing the class.

Now, to be honest, it was only the second time in college where I really clicked with other people for group work, and it was the first time I found myself being the charismatic ringleader. Or at least, I was the person they turned to when they needed help with the technical side of things. Pretty soon, however, one of the three girls was asking for help a lot more than anyone else, walking to the parking lot with me after class while we chatted, and sending me emails to see if I wanted to hang out.

Now, don't get me wrong, I can take a hint, but no good response seemed evident. Imagine, straight people of reddit, that someone of the same sex was lightly flirting with you in a completely non-sexual way. For all intents and purposes, it would seem about the same as someone trying to be friends. Except when a girl does this to a guy, especially with this level of vehemence (emails once or twice each day), it usually doesn't mean she just wants to be friends. I could hardly say ""I have no interest in dating you!"" without it seeming presumptuous, and I generally don't act very effeminate (the panties come off outside the bedroom), so my interest in dating guys is not really a thing people guess when they meet me.

After class on week seven, we leave like normal, with the other guy in our group (straight), me, and the girl walking to the exit. It turns out she's done with subtle hints, and drops the ""would you like to go out?"" bomb on me. I was impressed by how direct she was willing to be, but it was also really awkward, since I had spurned or ignored all of her advances, and kept our relationship purely professional. She was pretty enough, but not in a ""I wanna tap that"" way. More of a ""Wow that diamond looks pretty"" kind of way. What could I say? After weighing my options, I told her the truth. At this point it was just the two of us walking, and I told her I appreciated the offer, but I was only interested in dating other men. She seemed a bit skeptical at first, but I assured her it was the truth, and we parted ways rather amicably. It seemed like it was over.

But no.

I get home, and I already have three emails full of horrible broken English, tons of punctation (hundreds of exclamation points between sentences), and the general tone of a crazy person. The jist of it was ""OMG if u werzz tells truth!!!!!!@@# we shud hang outttttt@#$!~~!!""  I didn't respond. The next four weeks got progressively tense. I would come to class, she would sit next to me and ask me if I wanted to hang out (which I said no to... at this point I was really, *really* uncomfortable), and reiterated the general content of her emails. She wanted to be friends, she always wanted a gay BFF, she wanted to know what I thought about her hair, her clothes, the other boys in the class, and so on. I am nobody's gay BFF. The entire concept that being gay means changing who you are (acting fem), who you associate with (bubbly girls), and generally being marginalized to a 90's sitcom ""gay man"" stereotype repulses me.

I did my best to seem friendly, but firm. I told her I thought her emails were weird, and I was busy during the week, and no I didn't want to see movies and have heart to heart talks and come over for a sleepover (okay, that last one was fake, but come on). She kept sending emails, and they got progressively more... interesting. Some of them she would curse me out and call me a liar about being gay. Some she would apologize and demand to be friends. I never responded to (or acknowledged in class) any of the messages. The last one accused me of not liking her because she happened to be black (like I have a problem with that? I lost my virginity to black guy ffs). So by this point, she was completely freaking me me out, and luckily, I think after four weeks she finally got the message. For our last two classes, she was out sick, and to this day I don't know if she was really sick, or if she was just avoiding me, but I was thankful never to get another crazed email from her again.

So the next time you see someone asking a gay guy why he isn't ""more out"" just remember there are crazy people brainwashed by 90's TV out to get us. Rawr!

"chwzrc6","My issue with guys recently is that you shouldn't mistake politeness for flirtation. I work a receptionist/ desk job at a busy library and I do my best to be polite and friendly to all the patrons. Recently two guys have come in and started trying to talk to me way past small talk and it seems that my general friendliness has made them feel confident that they can waste my time and pester me at work. I have seen an example of this this also when eating out with guy friends at restaurants. The waitress was friendly, but they TOTALLY KNEW the waitress wanted to fuck them. Me and my other female friend at the table definitely got the vibe that she was being polite, as is her job and source of tips. 

This also brings me to my second point. Please consider the situation you are meeting someone in. For my example, I'm having the problem with two guys following me around at work. (walking up asking personal questions, making me do menial tasks so they can talk to me, etc) First of all, I am doing my job, which requires me to smile and help you with things. I am trapped by my situation where I must be polite, and my supervisor prevents me from telling you to fuck off. Secondly, just because I haven't said go away, or leave me alone DOES NOT mean I wanna bang you. I feel like this experience has helped me understand a little bit about why girls can be bitchy and just say ""I have a boyfriend"". I know that those people are usually bitcholes, but I get a tiny bit where it comes from. Some guys are oblivious until something hits them in the face. Don't be that guy.

In the end, I know that it's tough to decode and each situation is different. Just consider though, is she flirting or being polite? Could it be because she's working or obligated somehow? Am I getting too caught up in the chase that I don't realize she's not interested?

"cho4rjv","I was actually about to do this for my pet world. Came here for inspiration.

EDIT: Here it is.

NOTE: The term 'Ujua', although originally referring that are now known as Archaic Ujua, refers to any mix between the two, including full-bloods of both races, unless specified.

Ylvin is the country that was built around the ancestral home of the Archaic Ujua, supernatural beings created by the cataclysm. It has a combination of both the ancient (miniature humans, no name yet) and the Archaic Ujua's society, politics, and culture; however the resultant social classes are completely new.

Ylvin is ruled by the Upper Council, who oversee the Councils, who in turn oversee the Lower Councils. 

The Lower Councils are generally over individual towns and city sections, and are made up of the wisest of the elderly population. They vote to pass legislation, they meet to solve their town or city section's problems and issues, and they are responsibly for regulating inter-town, if it is a town. They generally have the final say over what happens in the town, down to where the roses are going in the town or section's biannual Joining Ceremony. Individual members can be replaced by a 70% majority vote of the population, or the entire Council by a unanimous vote by the population. 

Councils control, in a similar matter, various regions of Ylvin. These are not divided politically, but geographically, by general biome as well as geographical landmarks such as rivers, ravines, or mountain ranges. They oversee trade between city sections or towns, and have the authority to override a Lower Council's descision under their jurisdiction. Councils consist of Lower Council-elected representatives from the towns or city sections they control. Council Members can be disposed in a similar manner to a Lower Council member's disposition, but voting is done in the Lower Councils.  
It should be noted that there are Councils that preside over just one city, however due to the some cities' massive scales this is nothing special or unique, but it is rare.

The Upper Council presides over the entire country. They oversee international trade, foreign affairs, anything that a Council or Lower Council does not control. They do, however, directly control the Academies of the Magical Arts, of which there is at least one in every Council area. 

There is one Upper Council, twelve Councils, and roughly eleven to twelve Lower Councils for every Council, bringing the grand total of Lower Councils to around 144. This number will, of course, flucuate, as poulation rises and falls and towns are created, borders expanded, or towns destroyed and land lost.

The only the Upper Council does not control, however, is the military. That is handled independently, with suprisingly good results.

Defense is handled per Council region, and is usually controlled by a Legendary. To explain the class structure fo the military would require more patience than I have at the moment, but know that regulations are few.

The all of the councils, more or less, treat their citizens well. The citizens are fed, poverty is low, all races are treated equally (with a slight skew towards the mini human-Ujua descendents, well within tolerable limits), and the average citizen is well versed in local politics. Religion is non-existant, because the Archaic Ujua are fully aware of their origin and the (mini humans) don't really care. As far as they were concerned, their existence is a constant cycle which comes and goes as does the tide, which is arguable a religion at first glance (though it is more along the lines of a philosophy in context.)

In short, the citizens or Ylvin are generally content. Yet they live in constant fear.

Why?

It's because of the Tall Ones. For as long as even the oldest citizen remembers, there has been an ongoing war between Ylvin and the Tall Ones, fought on home ground. 

The Tall Ones are a seemingly-sentient race that appear to be creatures of smoke and fire underneath thick, metal armor. They are vicious, they are deadly, and nearly all of them share a vehement hatred towards the Ujua, and by extension the mini human-Ujua mixes that exist. They slaughter Ujua without discrimination, without regard to social class or age or gender or blood line. If it contains (mini-human) or Archaic Ujua blood, it must be slaughtered. It is unknown why they harbor this hatred, and several theories exist within the Academies, but none have any definiteve proof. 

Some points I couldn't figure out where to fit:

* View on death: When any Ujua with Archair Ujua dies, they more often than not manifest as a (relitivley) baseball-sized glowing ball of energy, unable to comminucate and unable to interact with most living people. They are utterly alone in this state, and for many they just stop thinking and thusly become primal, wild spirits. When the body dies and the spirit leaves, the body is either burned and the ashes spread in protected wildlands or the body is weighed down and thrown in the sea. Funeral ceremonies are often short and simple.

* Survival interfering with societal restrictions: There are no such traditions that interfere with survival.

* Tree Spirits: I almost forgot about them. The Tree Spirits sound exactly like what they are, spirits or trees, all sentient and tied to a tree.

"chnx832","Look, everyone has a ""work flirt"" and it sounds like that's exactly what you are. Someone they have a little crush on who breaks up the day nicely. It can be healthy and friendly, but the problems that can crop up are multiple and potentially intense/career ending.


A good rule of thumb for a work flirt is to keep it strictly within the office. No texting, no happy hour, etc.. It can be a little difficult because you guys have good chemistry, so you tell yourself that ""Hey, at least we can make great friends!"" But with a relationship predicated on flirting and already spending a lot of time together day to day, you're just asking for boundary breakage.


Even if you don't think you'd take it to a physical level, emotional affairs are just as hurtful and really common in the workplace. It's a little too easy to fall into them because you're around someone so many hours of the day and there's an attraction and you tell yourself it's totally friendly, but then you just keep pushing the envelope until it's inappropriate. It's also kind of telling that he has told you a lot about himself, but conveniently left out the part where he has a girlfriend.... 


Personally, I would suggest a lot of distance. Best case scenario: he doesn't like you back and your feelings get hurt. Worst case: he has a girlfriend and is looking to cheat. Mediocre case: he has a girlfriend and isn't *intending* to cheat but likes you and ends up behaving in a way that would hurt his girlfriend, hurts you because you can't have him, and hurts him because he has feelings for a girl he can't have and is also betraying the trust of someone he loves. 


If, however, you think you can handle being his work buddy without ever being his actual friend (again: no outside of work contact/hanging out), then fine. If he breaks up with his gf, cool! If not, there are other men out there.

"chep8dd","I work at a ranch, and we often rent out our horses, service (leading the horses, getting the kids ready, etc) and facilities to people for birthday parties. One woman had been coming out, planning with us, for quite awhile. She was one of the nicest women I've met, and she wanted pony rides for her daughter's fourth birthday. She invited her whole family and friends of the family. There would be lots of little cousins to play with the birthday girl and have pony rides with her. 

Flash forward to the day of the party. The lady turns up right on time with a couple of her personal friends. They unload, I dispatch a couple of our volunteers to help her put stuff in the fridge. She tells us there was really no need to sweep off the concrete under the gazebo again; its a ranch, there's dirt. No worries. Really the opposite of most of the jerks we tend to get. We have the horses and ponies out and ready.....and time passes. Nobody comes. We give the birthday girl pony rides. She seems upset that her friends (cousins) aren't there, so we discard the rule that only kids 5 and up can ride the big horses, and let her pick whichever larger horses she wants to ride. A volunteer takes her through the petting farm and stables, picking her up so she can pet the horses. It's been almost an hour. Nobody has shown up. It turns out that this woman, from a huge Mexican family, has all but been excommunicated from her family because she's a single, unmarried mom. She thought they'd come for her daughter; at least that the family friends would. But no. 

My boss called all the board members, every friend she had that had children, and called her son-in-law to ask if she could run into town and pick up her grandkids, who are about this girl's age. I called every volunteer I could think of, who weren't scheduled for that day. The party ended up being almost entirely our board members, their children, and volunteers. We did everything we could, helped out with food more than we generally do (we include grill and fridge use, and that's it), kept the horses out longer than usual, and even brought out the mini horses to play soccer and the friendly little goats for her to pet. At the end of the party, the mom ended up giving us all the ice cream that was supposed to have been for family, since she didn't have a big freezer at home. We helped her clean up, again something we generally don't do, since that's about the time we usually have people getting ready to feed the animals. The little girl ended up leaving pretty happy, but her poor mom....she was cheerful and friendly, but it was obvious that she was having to force it, since she was so upset that *not one* person came.

"cghsqs9","Hedgehogs are actually pretty hardy, overall, but they have some special considerations.

My sisters always had hamsters while I was growing up, and I never really liked them. I'm sure some people have sweet, cuddly hamsters with great personalities, but my sisters' hamsters were always unpersonable little beasts that bit and scratched, and were really not that great as far as pets go.

I've only ever had the one hedgehog, but I can tell you that it was much more fun and friendly than a hamster. Take a look at /r/hedgehog -- those photos aren't exaggerating; hedgehogs really are cute, fun, playful little animals. As long as you play with them and handle them regularly, they'll be friendly.

But while hedgehogs are bigger than hamsters and generally more sturdy, they're also fragile in ways that hamsters aren't. Hedgehogs need a certain kind of wheel so that their legs don't slip through the bars and get injured. 

Their diet is also a little more specific -- you can't (well, you shouldn't) just feed them cat food; hedgehog food is pretty widely available (and you can get it from Amazon, if nothing else). But they also love to eat fruits, yogurt, and mealworms. The first two you can probably find in your fridge, and the third comes from the pet store. (It's also pretty hilarious to feed them new foods, because they do this thing called [anointing](http://www.hedgehogcentral.com/photos/albums/userpics/400x371xnormal_fewer_pixels_Leo_anointing.jpg.pagespeed.ic.4WefTVhTR7.jpg), where they froth up like they have rabies, then lick the foam all over their quills.)

However, the weirdest and most important thing about hedgehogs is that they'll fall into hibernation if they get cold (hibernation is bad, because domestic hedgehogs aren't eating enough to prepare for it). I always kept a small heating pad on low under the half of the enclosure (I tried a cage, but my hedgehog would climb the bars and fall off when she got to the top, so I had to switch to an aquarium) where her little house was, and it seemed to be fine.

One last thing that may make a difference in your decision is that hedgehogs are pretty expensive (around $125 where I live), and they don't really live that long (mine lived to be 4, which is about the best you can hope for). The equipment to get started with a hedgehog is also more expensive, because they need a bigger enclosure, a heat pad, etc. (However, once you have them set up, the food and bedding -- hedgehogs need a corn-cob bedding, because wood chips can harm their lungs -- is only nominally more expensive than hamster food and bedding.)

I really enjoyed my hedgehog. They're a very unique and interesting pet, and I'd definitely say they're much more rewarding than a hamster, although they're also more expensive, and you need to be able to spend a few minutes playing with them at least a few times a week (I used to just hold her and let her run around on the couch while I watched TV) to make sure that they're socialized properly.

In the end, if you're not afraid of spending a few bucks to get started and your reason for getting a pet is that you want to be able to regularly spend a little time with a fun, friendly little animal, then I'd recommend a hedgehog. But if you don't have at least three or four days a week where you can spend at least 30 minutes playing with, maintaining the home, (including cleaning the cage -- although some hedgehogs can be trained to use a little litter box), and caring for your hedgehog, or if the initial price tag is too much, a hamster is much less demanding.",1396401177,"i've only ever had the one hedgehog, but i can tell you that it was much more fun and friendly than a hamster.","fun and friendly","friendly",NA,FALSE,"fun and friendly","fun",NA,NA,0

If it were me, I'd find a good set of wheels and then I would lower just a tiny bit (new wheels will look silly if your car is at the stock heights, -THIS is where you and me may differ, to set off the wheels right you will want a decent drop on the car, I love the low look but hate the ""lowered ride quality"".).

It dealt a lot with the struggle with the different groups as they were pushed out, like when the immigrants first move in, immigrant vs. gay, and so on. It had pictures of neighborhoods throughout the country as it went through the various cycles and talked about why it seemed to be a socio-economic norm that applies to the development of reemerging neighborhoods in any given city in the US.

At the start of college, I started crushing hard on this really cute girl.  We were friends, but I wanted more.  Being me being completely inept at flirting and her being spacey at times, everyone around us had to spell out to her that I was rather obviously into her.  Well, she didn't want a relationship, so she turned me down politely.  She knew I remained interested for awhile and told me as nicely as possible to move on.  She was quite a bro about it, and I had always appreciated that.  We were still close friends through the end of the year.

She takes a year off, then returns.  I had moved on and changed a bit, but during her time gone, she realized how much she liked me.  When she came back, I tried being friendly but distant so as not to make things awkward for her (not knowing that she liked me).  Well, a few months of her being confused and trying to get me to notice her later, she just decides to tell me that she liked me.  I thought it over seriously, weighing the possible pros (girl I always wanted, awesome relationship) and cons (me not being mature enough, distracting her from her academics, things going wrong and being awkward, loss of a friendship).

It's a little less friendly, but more granular data is [here](http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/62-001-x/2013009/t036-eng.htm)

Roughly speaking, cars are 28% more expensive, and municipal public transit is 46% more expensive over 10 years. (the definition of ""public transportation"" includes things like airplane flights and taxis. I'm restricting that to municipal bus and subway service because I think that's what most people mean when they talk about public transit)

Cars are more expensive because of gas and insurance. The physical cars have actually become cheaper even before accounting for inflation (remember everybody: don't go into debt for a depreciating asset). In total, the cost of purchasing and maintaining a vehicle has roughly kept pace with inflation.

Presumably public transit is more expensive because it was considered infeasible to maintain the previous level of subsidy over the expanded userbase and service levels. So part of the reason public transit is more expensive is that cities now offer new services that are necessarily more costly.

Of course the interesting question is what happens when it's considered infeasible to maintain the existing level of subsidies for private transportation (eg roads, bridges).

Externalities are another concern (eg carbon emissions).",1393545100,"[here's the data](http://www.statcan.gc.ca/tables-tableaux/sum-som/l01/cst01/econ160a-eng.htm)  it's a little less friendly, but more granular data is [here](http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/62-001-x/2013009/t036-eng.htm)  roughly speaking, cars are 28% more expensive, and municipal public transit is 46% more expensive over 10 years.

"cflaoj8","&gt; if I'm being completely honest, I would like her to do something just because I want to SOMETIMES. Not all the time of course, but sometimes. I think that's fair to ask of somebody in a relationship.

Totally fair! What's not fair is demanding that they enjoy it-- I go to conferences with my SO sometimes, and I get kind of freaked out by crowded conference halls. So I'm polite, and friendly, but probably a little distant (and sometimes I need to find a convenient stairwell and just chill there for a few minutes). I go because I want to support him and because he asks me too, but he doesn't ask me to have the best time ever because he knows I'm not naturally a fan (he just helps me have the best time I *can*). 

&gt;But there is also the fact that she loves card games. Loves them. It's something that her family does all the time. So really it wasn't a matter of her not liking the game as it was she didn't like losing to me. She gets very competitive.

I personally love boardgames, but avoid scrabble like the plague because I can't spell and lose every time. So instead of being grumpy and obviously annoyed at my inability, I just don't play. She probably deals with her competitive nature by trying to avoid games she's likely to feel outmatched in (a *huge* trigger). 

&gt;I would say I see what you are saying but I also am of the opinion that sleep can wait when we have something to discuss...there has been many times something went unresolved because she was tired and I was up all night thinking about it. Not fair in my opinion.

Here's the thing: **she's not right AND you're not right**. There's no objective rule about whether or not to have an in-depth conversation when one or both parties are exhausted. What you two need is a compromise that won't leave her feeling like her sleep is being held hostage to your emotions and *also* won't leave you feeling muzzled, awake and tossing. Maybe that's setting a timer: you discuss the situation for 30 minutes, then table it till the next day. Maybe it's just setting a firm date of when you will discuss it (e.g. tomorrow at dinner). I don't know what that compromise is, but you two NEED to find it, because otherwise one of you is going to feel resentful. 

I realize that I'm kind of sounding like I'm 99% on your wife's side here, and I'm not (tbh, she doesn't sound like she knows how to communicate very well)-- it's just you're the only one I can give advice too, and truthfully you can't change her actions, only your own.

"cf7xjnx","I don't think screen depth ordering should be the highest level of your logical object organization. Display is just one aspect of objects -- there is also physics, sound, and so on. Depth ordering makes sense for display objects (meshes, sprites, or whatever) but not for game objects (which are not equal to display objects, they are just related to them -- maybe contain them as components or whatever). The order of drawing doesn't matter anyway, that's what depth buffers are for. Of course, you gotta keep track of back-front sorting for partially transparent stuff.

Vectors are cache-friendly but hard for 'insert in between.' Linked lists involve jumping pointers and so are not cache-friendly but are great for 'insert in between.' Unless order within the list matters, you may as well use a vector and remove objects by swapping with end. In either case your implementation should be designed such that you could swap a vector out with a list or whatever else without much hassle.",1391633324,"vectors are cache-friendly but hard for 'insert in between.'","friendly but hard","friendly","but",FALSE,"friendly but hard","hard",NA,NA,1

"cf7wcx5","I'd love to be a member of the moderator community for you network! I feel I have some experience and friendliness to bring tot he table!

&gt;How often do you browse reddit?

Every day, for a substantial amount of time (4-8 hours a day total)

&gt;What time zone are you in, and what time(s) do you normally browse reddit?

Pacific Standard Time. I'm on periodically from 7am all the way to midnight depending on the day.

&gt;Do you have any previous moderation experience, on reddit or elsewhere? (not required)

Yes I have experience as a moderator, not on reddit, but on a large scale gaming forum (GameTrailers.com before a huge revamp in which I left) where I had over 15,000 posts and was moderator of a small section at first, but later came into charge over several other moderator groups. I was basically a Team Leader for moderators. I also have  coding background and could help with future CSS remodeling if I was called to do so.

&gt;Why do you want to moderate a network of art subreddits?

I love being an integral part of a community, helping users, correcting issues and making sure the community retains it's integrity. I'm also an appreciator of art, and although I'm not the best (hell I'm terrible) artist, I have a small background in art theory, and appreciation that allows me to truly marvel at the technique and skill of the artists. I'm a friendly but firm guy, and enjoy making sure things run smoothly.

&gt;Looking at the list of subreddits above, which three subreddits would you be most interested in moderating?


1. /r/ImaginaryLeviathans 
2. /r/ImaginaryBoners
3. /r/ImaginaryHorrors

&gt;Please tell us something interesting about yourself.

I'm an avid debtor, was captain of a team that won chapter of the year in the state of California in a school with a total attendance of 400, we beat out massive bay area schools with thousands of students. I'm a self taught coder since the second grade when my teacher had a book int he back of the classroom ""HTML for kids!"" and have had a strong passion ever since. I also read a lot of Lovecraft, and Lovecraft-esque  stories.

Thanks for taking the time to consider me as a moderator!

"cf34f1t","Typically people in the US who live in areas where there were high amounts of Scotch-Irish (Ulster Scots for you Brits) immigrants in the 17th and 18th centuries (the south, Appalachia, the mountain west) tend to be very friendly to strangers.  This is actually a common trait in ""mountain herder"" cultures throughout the world.  

What's funny is that shyness, at least in my rural southern/Appalachian upbringing, is considered a form of cowardice.  Talking to a stranger is sort of a way of showing that you are comfortable and not at all afraid no matter who they are.  Psychologically, by the way, this is pretty much true.  This is why shoplifting prevention (aka Loss prevention) specialists advise retailers to always greet customers at the door and look them in the eye.  It establishes a sort of ownership of the area.  

By the way, if you want to get your ass kicked in any rural, especially southern town in the US, make a passive aggressive comment to another man.  Passive aggressiveness makes us doubly fucking mad, because we see it not only as insulting to our intelligence, but as effeminate and cowardly.  My freshman year roommate learned that shit the hard way when he made a passive aggressive comment to one of my buddies from home.

"cekvre4","That was one of my more interesting realizations from transitioning. I am ftm, and I notice these gender differences on a small scale most of the time. The only times it's impacted me enough to speak of is in social situations where you meet new people, rather than your day to day stranger.
For example work or school. 
I got my first job, unfortunately at McDizzle's, when I was 17. (I didn't begin transitioning until 18. I am only 20 now but I pass very well as a male). At 17 I was your stereotypical 'bull-dyke.' So my appearence was never considered welcoming and friendly, but I had never had problems making friends or anything. But back to the point, my first day at McD, my co-workers all introduced themselves and helped me out. It's a lot to learn in a fast paced enviornment, and it isn't as if McDonald's invests too much into preparing you for the job. You just throw on a shirt and hope for the day to end. 
I started in the grill area where 2 other people worked closely with me. As a new person, I had a million questions and didn't know how to do anything. At the time, my gender didn't occur to me. But I remember thinking everyone was really helpful and it was really comforting to know that I could ask questions when I needed to. 

About a year into hormone therapy, my voice had dropped and the peach fuzz on my chin was dark enough to mask my baby face. I was promoted to management there, so I transferred to a different store to get a fresh start as a male, where no one knew that I was born female. 
Although I had experience and knew what I was doing, it was still a new store with new faces. This meant I would still be new, and still have to ask new-people questions. Mainly, I didn't know anyone's names, who worked well where, who worked best with who, what the stores customers were like, where anything was, and I was brand new to management so I didn't even know how to count down a drawer. 

My first day there, no one introduced themselves. When I asked questions, people gave me really short answers. I am convinced that had I been a woman asking where something was, someone would have offered to SHOW me. But at the current time, they pointed to the back room and said, ""On the rolling shelves."" There are 8 of those with 4 racks on each one offering storage space on both sides. That literally was as helpful as pointing at the entire state of New York and saying, ""NYC is in the bottom."" 

Eventually, I left that job and moved again. I started working overnights stocking at Walmart. (As you can see, I've had a ton of wonderful jobs). Here I felt even more hated. My first day, no one told me ANYTHING. The manager was like, ""This is Matt and Dan, they are new. Help em out."" All night I felt like I was speaking English in a foreign country.

I haven't figured out if men have a natural instinct to determine an unspoken heirarchy or if I gave off a confusing vibe of caring about being the alpha-male. It's ironic to me. 'Normal' people strive to stand out, transgendered people tend to strive to blend in. 

So at Walmart, no one was helpful. Women would only approach me if no one else was around. And when they did, it was always to ask me if I would get something off a high shelf, carry something heavy, or open their soda for them. Which always amused me. Always. 
The guys however, being that we were all overnight stockers, there was heavy lifting from time to time. So I noticed that if one guy was stocking the pets department and I was nearby in another one, whenever I walked by to throw out my cardboard or something, they would double up how much they were carrying. This one guy in particular, I noticed that when he was stocking things, he took his time. 50lb box of cat litter, he would take one at a time. Whenever I walked by he would take two. 
So either that was to establish he was stronger than I was and assert his dominance, or he was just randomly giving a shit about how long he took. 

In college I was always male. But the classroom interactions reminded me of all the new school experiences I had the luxury of having. In high school, you sit by your friends or in the back of the room. (Or the front, depending on your motivation). But I had been to 5 different schools. Each time, SOMEONE reached out and said, ""Hey are you new?"" To start a conversation and save me from my awkward isolation as the new kid. In college, mostly everyone was new. But the area I was in, they all knew each other. It was a community college in a small town where everyone knew everyone. So I got there and they all were chatting, catching up, all that 'how was your summer?' buisness. 

No one spoke to me until the 5th class after enough of the teacher forcing group work. This was pretty much the same in all four of my classes. 

As for strangers and interactions with them, there is still a difference. Women are more approachable and men never ask for directions. Sad and not nearly explained in depth. But that is my guideline. 
People really treat you differently based on your gender as well as the perception you give off. 

I work at Verizon now, and the way customers bitch at me as a male is different. People don't hold back when they yell at men. 

But it's not all bad. People seem to have shifted from, ""Sir"" to boss, chief, bud, and just ""man."" 
I don't love those informal formalities. But it beats m'am.

Also, a business now has all of their actions placed on the front pages of Reddit, so when business is stuck up, impatient, and unfair to its employees, the whole world gets to see it. Then the whole world gets to decide whether they want to support a business that is rude or a business that is kind.

Maybe business isn't nice and friendly, but the people they're trying to pull money from ARE, and things like ""the way you treat your employees"" actually matters to people.

The problem is when business minded people separate themselves from their community and act exclusively for personal interest. What kind of world do we want to live in?

"cebr9sq","You never did answer my questions from earlier. I have killed many cockroaches in my life, and even more viruses, but I would never hurt a dog or a cat. In some cultures, dogs aren't nearly as revered, and beating or eating fido doesn't carry any stigma at all. And what about embryos? zygotes? Defining who is a human and who gets rights is a highly contentious issue that has changed more than once in my lifetime.


Humans, and other animals, have developed the capacity for empathy. We understand that doing unto others is usually the right thing to do. But we have other influences on our behavior too... someone starving and broke may very well overlook the golden rule. Self preservation, like you mention, makes even killing justified in our minds. But like the Trayvon Martin case so tragically illustrated, people can and do commit horrible acts in the full belief that they are in the right. Where were Trayvon Martins natural rights?


What good are these 'rights' you claim exist with no recourse to enforce them? I can go to Somalia and express my beliefs in my inalienable right to life all I want, that isn't going to save my ass from getting gunned down. I've been to Somalia, when I was there, it was lawful and peaceful and friendly. But with no government? Who is saying that Somalis have rights? What rights? No government = no rights.


Most everyone has a fairly good idea of right and wrong, but when you examine closely, you'll find that no two people agree exactly. I don't have a problem with a woman terminating a zygote if she wishes. Many people find that wrong. I don't question their belief, I know they think it's wrong, I understand why they think it's wrong. But I have a different perspective and am inclined to give deference to a woman's wishes to be in charge of her own fertility.

"ce8eavs","Because it never should've been sold.  Microsoft made two lines of Windows - NT and 9x.  9x was the DOS-based version of windows.  This included 95, 98, 98SE, and Me.  9x is rather silly because it is still basically DOS - the UI is a program running within DOS, so when shit hits the fan, the UI crashes and it reverts back to text.  

NT, however, had existed for quite awhile.  It stood for  ""New Technology"", iirc.  I couldn't tell you how it works at all, but it did a far better job of keeping processes from pulling the whole operating system down because they didn't have as direct of access to the kernel (again, someone feel free to correct me).  

Now here's where marketing comes into play.  NT existed since the days of 95, and was solid but not very user-friendly (plug-and-play, usb, etc weren't as common initially) although it had the same UI.  9x was user-friendly but extremely unreliable.  9x was marketed to consumers, NT to businesses.  

However, Microsoft came up with the plan to merge the two product lines into one OS.  They claimed ""98 will be the last version of 9x sold"" and future products would be NT-based.  However, they fucked up and came out with 98SE and Me.  98SE was kinda needed because it improved 98 a lot (stability, better USB support, etc), and believe it or not, Me was better than both, having more features and theoretically being more stable (my theory is that, by the year 2000, people were using computers more intensely and also comparing it to 2000, XP, and OSX, and thus considered a downgrade simply because it wasn't much of an upgrade).  

But Windows 2000 came out a few months BEFORE Me - and unfortunately, instead of being marketed to both, was only marketed to businesses.  Me came out AFTER 2000, and was marketed to consumers, even though 2000 was better (in fact, despite the release dates, it's possible to upgrade from Me to 2000, but not the other way around).  Me was a dead dog, being not horrible, but merely far worse than what Microsoft was capable of in the year 2000.  It shouldn't've ever been released.  XP came out a year later, and finally merged the two product lines into one product.  

I should add, that every product since NT version 4.0 is still NT-based.  2000 is technically NT 5, XP is NT 5.1, Vista is NT 6, Windows 7 is NT 6.1.  They are ALL based off the same type of kernel invented in the 90s.  And they are all a million times better than Me.

"ce3xd31","I'm going to be perfectly honest with you: I would have hated that gift of a dog puzzle, training book, and treats. I wouldn't have been rude to your face like they did, and I would have thanked you, but you can bet I would have been resentful about it and I'd be griping to my friends at school and my parents later. I think it's a bad gift to get any kid, unless you know for an absolute fact that they are majorly into all things dog and are actually more involved with their dogs than the average kid. I'm really not trying to be mean or start a fight here, but you basically gave those kids a task for Christmas, and despite how you intended for it to be used, the puzzle and treats *are* for the dog. 

I think there's a fine art behind giving gifts that has fallen by the wayside due to people wanting to feel good about themselves under the guise of pseudo-generosity, instead of making the recipient of the gift feel good.  I sort of cringe when I hear people say, ""I bought this for them because I know *I'd* like someone to get this for me!"" It's not about what you'd like to get. It's about knowing the person for whom you're buying the gift and trying to get something they'd like. 

Based on your reddit history, you are big into dogs. You run a dog daycare center and you've remarked that when you were a kid, you would have loved to get something like that - but that was you. I know you meant well, and your nieces and nephews shouldn't have been rude to you, but they probably felt like you were thinking about the dog when you bought them those gifts and not them. It's a nice idea on paper to try to teach kids something by way of their gifts at Christmas, but it's usually poorly executed and goes over like a lead balloon. 

My mother in law tries to say that she desperately wants to give us presents because it brings her so much joy. I'm not usually one to stomp all over someone's joy, but it's a considerable source of stress and un-joy for us. She has us make lists every year, but if my husband puts a fine bottle of scotch on his list (and that's all he ever really wants) she won't buy it for him. Some silly thing about sinful behavior, and also an inability to accept the fact that he's a 34 year old grown man. If we put down gift cards, she whines that she wants to see us open boxes. We figured out the monetary value of all the crap she gave us one year and tried to put one item on our list that cost close to that amount, and we got the box-opening whining again. For her it's quantity over quality and it's what makes *her* happy. In my discussions with people about this, some of them have brought up gift-giving as one of the five love languages, and suggested to me that maybe that's how she shows her love. Not that I buy into the love language stuff all that much, but what people seem to forget when they bring up the love languages is that you're supposed to ""talk"" to the person in the love language that makes them feel loved, not what works for you. (That's straight out of the book, too.)

Anyway I'm totally rambling. I hope I haven't hurt your feelings or pissed you off. That was not my intention. I know this sounds weird coming from a CF person, but if we had children in the family I'd honestly rather buy some things for them and be done with it. Dogs don't know it's Christmas but for kids it's a huge fucking deal, and while I can't speak for anyone else, I really couldn't give two shits if anyone bought me anything. I'm gainfully employed and can buy myself whatever I want.

So I mostly agree with you - the idea of it being a gift-giving holiday sucks, but for kids, again, huge fucking deal. Here's an idea: If you love to travel, take a trip every year so you opt out of the nonsense and then bring each of your nieces and nephews one small, really cool, kid friendly but still interesting thing from your adventures. It might inspire them to do the same someday.

"cdzsbwj","First of all, good for you that you're even thinking about how better to relate to someone who's personality isn't your own.  This already puts you a step ahead of the game.

I can only speak for myself, and I am not sure how much is INTP related, and how much is just NearInfinite related, but here it goes.

I don't want to be put in the position where I am directly and immediately responsible for my partners happiness.  I love nothing more than to make my partner happy, but when I need some down time, I don't want to feel guilty because I am not in entertainer mode.  I'm intelligent, funny, and friendly, but I don't like to have to be 'on', all the time.

My most recent two long term relationships have been with very friendly, very outgoing, very external-stimulus kinds of people.  I try to stay in shape, but my most recent girlfriend didn't stay interested that kind of thing for long.  So when I am lifting or running, I did it alone, and they felt ignored.  If I was playing a video game or a similar stereotypical downtime kind of activity, she wasn't interested in joining, and felt ignored.  On the flipside, I felt run down much of the time.  We went out, at least just for dinner/drinks, just together or with friends, pretty much every day.  If there was a party, we were there early, and were the absolute last people to leave.  She'd go into social butterfly mode and that would be the last I'd see of her, and I'd wander from group to group, desperate to find someone who wanted to talk about something more interesting to me than celebrities, sports or their kids.  This is more of an introvert vs. extrovert issue, and probably doesn't relate, but it's something I think a lot about now when assessing what I am looking for.  I need to be able to relax without feeling like I am letting someone down.

I like to keep my schedule as free as possible, so that if something comes up, I'm free to do it.  If nothing comes up, great, I can do whatever I want to do, or don't want to do.  I've dated people who have a full schedule of various voluntary tasks and activities that can go for weeks out without a moment free.  That's exhausting to me.  Not judging it, but it's just not for me.

They need a sense of humor that is somewhat compatible with mine.  I'm pretty much going to have something (that I think is) funny to say all the damn time.  You don't have to laugh, but you at least have to get it.  I'll take an eye roll, or a ""You're a terrible human being."", but too many blank stares and we're probably not on the same page.

I'd love for them to occasionally be on board when I ""Go down a rabbit hole of thought"", as sanzonin said in this thread.  I know that I vocally ponder some absurd and out-there ideas that pop in to my head.  So I don't expect everyone to happily jump in on everything I speculate on.  But it is really nice to have someone who is willing to step out of the moment and go on a little intellectual cruise for a bit.

Core beliefs should be at least not contradictory.  I find that I have a hard time with people who have strong opinions without strong reasoning behind them.  Or people who are more desperate to ""win"" a debate rather than to find the actual truth of the matter.  I'll take the logician or philosopher over the lawyer every time.  Intellectual dishonesty is an automatic huge negative for me.  I'm happy to be proven wrong today, it means I am probably closer to the truth on an issue tomorrow.

Sex.  Just be on the same page, at least about frequency.  Everyone is really, really different on what they are into, what feels good, what doesn't, what might be a negative trigger, etc.  Gotta be able to talk about this open and honestly, without judgement, or there will be quiet resentment about it.  How does the saying go?  Sex is 10% of a good relationship, but 90% of a bad one.

Fundamentalists and atheists could probably find better matches, politically involved liberals and conservatives could probably find better matches.  Someone wanting to have a large family and someone who doesn't want kids should probably figure that out early and save each other the breakup later.  Love blinds for a while, but not forever.

This has gotten a bit long and meandering, so I'll stop.  Good luck.

"cdqpq2g","Previously: http://www.reddit.com/r/tea/comments/1ro63v/im_looking_for_tea_in_sf/  
  
So you guys really came through! I had a big list of shops to try to visit and didn't get to nearly as many as I wanted to since of course the family took forever to get to SF and then dragged their feet as much as possible browsing and shopping. I should have come alone and met up with them later!  
  
Anyways, so the teas.  
  
* First stop - Red Blossom Tea Company  
Honestly, I was a little disappointed here. The selection was fantastic, and the service was very nice and friendly, but unhelpful. When I walked in I was greeted by a very nice young lady who asked if she could help me with anything or if I knew what kind of teas I was looking for. I replied with a ""yes, I'm looking for some nice teas. I generally like blacks and darker oolongs and am new to puerh's"". She pointed to the tea canisters and showed me the oolongs and blacks and said I could open them and smell them if I like. That was pretty much it. There was no tasting and when I asked, she said if there was one I was interested in purchasing, they could brew a small amount. But.. If I don't know what it tastes like, I don't know if I want to buy it. She seemed more into greeting the people coming into the store than making tea recommendations. I really tried to get her to help me out by telling her some of the characteristics in teas I like, but she just didn't seem interested or perhaps she wasn't very knowledgeable (new perhaps?). She did suggest at one point I try a cold brew iced tea they had made from one of their more popular oolongs, and I eventually bought two ounces of that one (Phoenix Oolong Orange Blossom - not actually flavored with orange blossoms, it's just a description).  
  
* Second stop - Vital Tealeaf  
Hands down the best stop of the day!! I did not get to meet Uncle Gee, but the two gentlemen working today were so fantastic and helpful. They were GENUINELY interested in finding teas that I would like, regardless of cost, meaning they didn't want to push expensive teas that you didn't like. I stayed here for at least an hour, trying some great teas. The tea-tender really listened to me when I said what I liked and didn't like. He even poured me a tea at one point and said ""I already know you probably won't like this one"", but he was pouring the same tea for about a dozen people that were in the shop at the point so we all got the same one. These guys really knew their tea AND really knew their customers. Teas purchased: ""Red Robe"" (no idea if it's actually a Da Hong Pao, it wasn't described as such but was DELICIOUS) and ""Woodbridge Puerh"", a very woody Puerh that I liked over their more earthy options. Also, first time in my life I tasted an $800/lb tea!! :)  
  
* Third stop - Nam Hai Corporation (what?)  
So, this was just a random giant well-lit well-organized not-stinky herbal shop. I only walked in here because I was babysitting my aunt and she wanted some Chinese medicine or something. This place was only about 2-3 doors down from Vital Tealeaf. As I walked in and browsed further, I noticed they had a counter backed by tons of huge glass jars of loose teas and a ton of puerh cakes underneath the glass. They also had all tea marked 30% off!! Very cute young chinese girl working the counter but she knew NOTHING about tea. I mean, literally nothing. She had no idea what the differences between the puerh's were or anything like that. So, I decided to play the lottery. I bought 2 random puerh bricks (the actual brick-shaped ones in the photo) and a 1/4lb of ""Classic Oolong"" loose tea and 1/4lb of ""Dong Ding Oolong"". I had tasted a Dong Ding at Vital Tealeaf a few minutes previously and liked it, but not enough to pay the Vital prices for it. I decided to give this random one a chance at 30% off. It smelled good, but who knows what it will taste like. Maybe I'll just end up making iced tea with it!  
  
* Fourth (and sadly, final) stop - Ten Ren Tea Co  
Got seated by a very friendly and somewhat knowledgeable gentleman that also asked what kind of tea I liked and tried to serve according to my tastes. This experience was good, not as good as at Vital, but good. At Ten Ren it felt a little more sales oriented as he immediately tried to push their house brand ""Kings Tea"", which is an oolong blended with ginseng leaves. It was a good tea, I won't lie, but I wasn't really interested in blends and after all the tea tasting that I had already done at Vital, was more looking for something new and unique to pop out at me. I did get to taste a 50+ year old puerh and it was delicious. Here they were more interested in demonstrating multiple steepings, so we had less actual varieties of tea, but more infusions of each (3-4). I ended up with 2 ounces of their middle-of-the-road 20-year puerh and 2 ounces of (shit, I forgot) something oolong. I also bought the little cake of puerh in the photo, and a bag of their individually wrapped puerh cakes.  
  
That's pretty much it!! Thanks all so much for the helpful suggestions. I'm sad I couldn't visit more shops that were recommended, but I was on a time crunch.

"cdqfg0l","Personally, half of these really don't belong here but I can see why. 

LAX - This was a disappointment to Game fans, not really the general public (which is what the album was intended for). While people like me hated it because it was evident that we no longer had the same game on our hands, He picked up a shit of a new following because of it.

Ball Street Journal - It's E-40 man what are you trying to get at? He always was a guy who sticks to Bangers, 5 years changes the sounds and styles of those beats. While I can agree they aren't as good as his previous work, E-40 brought what E-40 fans wee expecting (unless if they expected him to change or grow).

Till the Casket Drops - Yeah I can see it. I personally never liked clipse and the article kind of speaks for it'self. Someone like The Game who usually has a ton of exposure in the first place is someone who you can expect to sell out. Clipse? eh not really. I actually liked the album, but this is coming from a guy who doesn't like their previous work. I can agree with this. 

Asleep in the Bread Aisle - Are you Kidding me? The album was perfect for the typical ~~college~~ highschool student to get high to, and picked up a cult following because of it. While I could care less for the guy, the people who he appealed to ate his shit up. and this quote right here 

""The first group consisted of fans that checked out the album because they loved the single
I Love College"" and left disappointed because the whole thing wasn't a radio ready ode to partying""

Heavily disagree with that statement. Around that time I was starting to get into going to parties and drinking (or in other words standing in the corner while I watch everyone else drink) and my god there was always some mother fucker who had Lark on My Go-cart, Blunt Crushing, or She don't want a man playing. 


Attention Defincit - No no no no no no no no no. Ladies and gentlemen there are two kinds of people in this world. People who like Wale IN Maybach and People who liked Wale BEFORE Maybach. That number of people who liked him before is very underestimated. That is all. 

The Adventure of Bobby Ray - The first quote explain it all 

""From the very beginning of his career, it was clear B.o.B was not a typical rapper. He was an MC, producer, and singer who insisted on making different types of music"" 

And stop right there, cut print, paste. Did you not expect he was going to release something like this? He continues to do the same pattern in his music today. Leaves the Rapping on a few songs on an album AND a full mixtape. All of BOB major releases usually were singing or some form of it. That is at least what I expected going into it. To be honest, a little question, who really considers BOB to only be a rapper in his solo work?

Continued..... because I'm bored....... BRB....

The Appeal - Never heard of it and don't care for it. 

Lasers - I don't even think I need to say anything. HHH can go on for days on why this album was a disappointment. To be fair on Lupe, this album made me a fan of him. 

Rolling Papers - Now this is something I can standby as a disappointment. Wiz had a huge ass following without ever reaching a AAA release. The dude was on fire, he had great ass mixtapes, he was able to tour so well.............. and then this dropped. Atlantic obviously wanted this album to be not only radio friendly, but new listener friendly. Oh there were remains of his previous style, but it was very unlike him. The worst part about this album is that it's something you can't really smoke too.

Tha Carter 4 - This is also something I can get behind. Everyone was a Lil Wayne fan at some point. Man oh man did people have hype for this. 6'7' was great song he released after he got out of jail which even got me to be interested..... and then it's all downhill from here. Now Waynes fanbase he was carrying at this point were the reeeeeaaally hardcore wayne fans and the people who he picked up from in between Cater 2 and 3. IANAHB was a big disappointment on some part, but it wasn't too much of a big project. Then he dropped Sorry 4 the Wait, which a lot of earlier fans (especially fans of his mixtapes) were very disappointed in. Then lord behold, the AAA release came out, and it sounded like he put the same effort into it from Sorry 4 the Wait. That timeline can also be classified as a personal timeline for the record.

Sideline Story - This hits too close to home man............. Yes, J Cole has a great following right now. Yes, he is still considered a pretty good rapper for today's standards. Yes, this album like almost every other disappointing album mentioned on here was made into something radio friendly that took away from the rappers original roots. What I hate about Sideline story the most was that J Cole used to be one of my favorite rappers. It was a shame he was putting out such average material in this album. I guess I'm getting a little too biased after all of this time writing this thread, but still man. Oh and for those saying ""Well what about Lost ones"" that track was originally from 2008. If you want to know the pain of the Pre-Sideline Cole fan, listen to the original Lost Ones and compare it with the newer one. 

Dreams and Nightmares - You know, I know see a patern in all of these. Debut Albums where the artist flew away from their roots in order to make things more marketable and radio friendly. I belive I have said enough. For the record though, never liked Meek Mill. 

Cruel Summer - Ok now we got a different contender. Now this album was brought down not by the urge to be radio friendly, but the fact it was waaaaaaay over hyped. I mean come on, everything sounded like it was going to be the best album ever... but collabs with that many artists never really come out to be amazing (unless well..... Wu) 

Based on a True Story (yup I spelt it like that, sue me) - ok ok ok ok ok .......... what? Now this is a Debut that has everything you were expecting from an Artist like Chainz. You don't go into it for the quality of his lyricism or his flow, you go to have some fun. That was 2 Chainz ever since he changed his name from Titty Boy. 

God Forgive, I don't - Only Song I heard was So Sophisticated. As someone who doesn't like Rick Ross, I actually liked that song. But I digress

"cdmhlur","I'm really not sure I will be able to explain myself eloquently enough to paint my feelings on these matters but I'll do my best and hope I will answer you question. :) (might be a tad long)

What we learn as children can stick with us for our entire lives. That is why it is important to have a healthy (physically and emotionally) childhood. Childhood forms our habits, our beliefs, our personalities. These things can change over time, but how we're raised can have a huge influence on the rest of our lives. 

I was raised by a Christian mother and an Atheist father. Not the best combination and it ended in a friendly but sad divorce. I'm a guy, and although I love my dad and spent as much time with him as I could I still favored Christianity for whatever reason. So every Sunday I would go to church with my mother and younger sisters while my dad hung out with his buddies.  Each of those days, I would be preached to. I just went with it what they told me as it simply felt right. Wasn't long before I considered myself a ""Baptist"" as well. I believed there was a God, and I pretty much accepted everything the pastor would preach as truth. 

As I grew older I would have debates with friends regarding theism vs atheism and other things like creationism vs evolution and how all four related to each other or didn't. These discussions would sometimes be friendly, and other times not. But what it made me realize as I'd try to explain my beliefs to my friends is that I didn't really know what the heck I was talking about. I was just repeating what I'd been told, and so were they. 

As I grew older I became more and more preoccupied with responsibilities (school and work) and my hobbies. But I still went to church on Sundays to get some preaching. I didn't make any personal time to actually read the Bible and see what Christianity really was. I've heard hundreds if not thousands of verses over the years but there are tens of thousands in the Bible and I just came to realize how little I actually know about this religion I have based my entire moral compass off of. 

So recently I started reading my Bible for myself and actually paying attention to what everything meant. I also started doing some scientific research and comparing evolution to creationism. You would be amazed at how much you don't know if you've never read the Bible. 

I'm also trying to learn more of other religions and plan on reading their books as well to compare them to each other. This is some really important stuff. I mean think about it, if there is an eternity, if there is an afterlife (and I believe there is, in my gut, but I'm reading to see if it reinforces this feeling or not) then it's pretty damn important to know what's right and do the right thing. 

Think about it. What do you really know about being a Baptist. What do we stand for? How do we know we're right? It's the questions that I feel I'm having the hardest time trying to put to words to explain to you how I feel about these things.

I'm sorry this was so long. I hope I might have been able to clarify things a little. Please feel free to ask me any more question or rebut anything you feel I'm wrong about.

"cdmglws","I worked 6pm-6am last Black Friday at Walmart and it was hell on earth. There was no way to move from behind the counter, and when I did manage to make my way across from the electronics department where I work as the connections associate to the photo center I was harassed by customers and pushed and shoved around. There was a cashier who had her wrist broken when someone shoved her and then she was hit by a cart. The plastic wrap covering shippers that were not available until later sales were being torn off and all of the merchandise taken. (One woman screamed at me after I told her the item she had taken from the ransacked shipper would not even be available for sale for another 6 hours.) It's funny because other times I've witnessed mass amounts of people crowding around for an event it's usually a concert and they are generally very kind and friendly, but I've only seen fights and dirty looks with these crowds.

Oh and the worst part of this was that since I had started working in May of last year I wasn't applicable for holiday pay. It's not like it even matters anyway, since even if I was in a position to receive a hefty holiday paycheck hours are cut down store wide. So not only would my paycheck not increase very much, but departments are left with low coverage for the remaining holiday season and with few workers to clean up the Black Friday mess.


This was more to do with the Xbox One sale (edit:a few days ago): There were 4 Xbox Ones at my store that about 12 people were waiting to purchase and there was not allowed to be a line formed at the register. These people were told to step away from the counter and formed this amoeba around the department, pretending to look at phones, movies etc. They thought the Xbox One's were going to be sold back in electronics, and weren't expecting it when a manager announced over the loud speaker that the line for the Xbox One was now to start forming at layaway.

Most dogs are going to want to run in some way, though poodles are great at playing outside but being calm inside. Labs can be a bit hyper...a bit may be an understatement.

If you can find a safe space to let them off leash daily with a either a long leash or recall training, you don't necessarily need to run with them.

Example: A female friend treats you poorly.  Justification: her boyfriend cheated on her with his ex and she's just taking her stress on you.

The catch: When she got with him, she was the original mistress.  He cheated to be with her.

Although being upset and snapping at you because of her situation can be understandable, she set herself up for that situation to happen to her in the first place.

Best example would be the latest change to Brewmaster in 6.79 which make the hero has at least 8 active abilities that could be executed from 3 different units and Primary Hero. Or some of you might have heard of the infinite Invoker.

Look at shootmania and where it is today. Self advertised as the NEXT Quake, it didnt provide the mechanical skill ceiling that people enjoyed so much they even make a new sub game genres for it(google defrag quake).

The point is, even thought increment in mechanical ceiling could be a nightmare to attract new players, it is necessary for players to feel rewarded, satisfied. And the only way to have such feeling in a COMPETITIVE game is to let them differentiate themselves from others by comparing mechanical skill. Broodwar was extremely rewarding, same as dota and quake. Thats why even though those games are more than 10 years old, people are still enjoy playing and watching it. There are a certain level of appreciation coming from both the players and the viewers given the default knowledge of the mechanical ceiling.

"cd9tzhl","One exciting area of research at the place where social science and computer science intersect is in social network analysis.  And by ""social network analysis"" I do not mean simply ""analyzing what people say on Facebook or Twitter.""  Social network analysis might involve the analysis of discussion on actual social network sites like this, but social network analysis is a social science method that has been developed over the last 100 years or so.  Traditionally, of course, the analysis of social networks was done using self-reporting of connectedness.  Or there is the famous ""Small world experiment"" in which people in the 1960s were asked to try to send a package to a person they did not know, and the researcher observed how many people the package had to go through to reach the target (this study is popularly cited as a foundational study in the idea of ""six degrees of separation."") With the development of the internet and other related technologies then, researchers are using social network analysis to study social structure that we can observe through patterns in online interactions.  It would be up to you as a researcher, partly by learning what's been done already, to develop new ways of using computer packages to analyze interactions that are relevant for political science/social science.

So basically, the internet and the various technologies we use to connect with people have created what I would generally call a new kind of record of human interaction that we haven't be able to see in the past.  In this sense, I think it would be useful for you to learn to do programming and use the various kinds of software available that enable you to collect and analyze interactions as they can be observed within internet-mediated communication.  One person whose work you could check out is a guy named Alex Hanna (http://alex-hanna.com/), a graduate sociology student who I does social network analysis of online communication.  

There are obviously lots of other people using various languages and software that you can use in concert for this kind of analysis.  Some software has been developed that is more user friendly but less customizable and you'd have to figure out what software will work for what you want to do.  Deciding what kind of computer packages to use is largely a matter of deciding how much time you want to spend learning to program versus finding applications for software that allow you to focus more on the social science concepts in your research.  You can also consider the possibility of finding computer science students or other students with programming experience and then collaborate with them rather than trying to learn the computer stuff yourself.",1383937929,"some software has been developed that is more user friendly but less customizable and you'd have to figure out what software will work for what you want to do.","friendly but less","friendly","but",FALSE,"friendly but less customizable","customizable",NA,"less",1

next time you want to go out to eat, ask her BEFOREHAND if she can get you back for the dinner you bought her 'this time' because you paid for her last time. 

put your tampons in your underwear drawer, that shit is not cheap and tampon stealing is a really big roommate pet peeve of mine. 

You need to cut out this passive aggressive 'im annoyed but wont say anything' stuff RIGHT NOW or college is going to be miserable for you in regards to roommates. THE ABSOLUTE BEST way to deal with this is to be straight up and NOT be afraid of being forward or you will continue to get taken advantage of. believe me, i learned the hard way. i cannot tell you how many sink fulls of dishes i washed that weren't mine because i didn't want to nag....when I finally figured out that all i had to do was bring the issue up in a direct way 'hey girl can you wash this pan you just used?' my life seriously changed. being assertive in a friendly but firm way is such a great skill to have and is a huge part of being an adult.

you need to speak up (in a nice but blunt way) and kindly ask her to get you back for the dinner she owes you, tell her she can't eat your snacks unless she splits the grocery bill with you guys (in fact, i would go a step further and split it 3 ways in my head and when she goes for snacks say 'hey, your share is $10 or whatever if you want to share our food with us.') you NEED to practice being blunt and straightforward now. 

&gt;It’s hard to be like “oh my dad just sent me another package of food and A, you can eat it with me but B, you can’t.”

this is not exactly fair because you aren't actually paying for the food your dad is sending you, are you? so why would you share it with A but not B? is A giving you money for it or something? If you are going to share your care package (for all intents and purposes, free) food with one roommate then you probablykind of have to share it with the other. it's both or nobody in this instance.

But for the rest of the time, if someone owes you money you need to be able to ask for it. College is a time for life skills. People like this WILL get away with taking advantage and getting things for free because you feel too ""nice"" to say anything... it is not nice. You will get more and more fed up and this will eat your friendship and your living situation will become awkward. If you ever life off campus you will quickly figure out how annoying it is to have to hunt your friends down for bill money (they know it comes every month but for some reason can't be bothered to pay it without asking 10 times!) if you don't ask it won't be paid. you need to step up your confrontation game.

First:  They bow, if I judge there is sufficient time I return the bow.  Sufficient time is the justification they cannot run up and backstab me before the end of the animation.  In cases where I believe this person is friendly, but too close, I quickly wave.

Second:  My shield goes down when the threat goes away.  I'm primarily a spear/shield player so this means I accept my position in defensive posture.  If the next move is:

*  A bow/gesture, it is returned appropriately as described above.

*  A BOW, as in miniature spear-launching apparatus, I drop my shield.  If they fire I raise shield and block it, match begins.  If they bow, I wave.  If they charge or throw something I show them the pointy stick.

"cclobf5","My mom who is basically my best friend is an ENFP. She's warm and friendly, but doesn't put up with bullshit. She's quite driven and has the ability to thoroughly get things done. She's also a smart lady, and we communicate effectively with each other, and have the same sense of being logical while maintaining creativity and having somewhat lofty dreams. She's quite practical, and I appreciate her decisiveness when I tend to think about something that doesn't really need that much thought.

My few complaints would be that our stubbornness can clash, but there are rarely hard feelings, and if I think I've said something hurtful, an apology is easy and not a huge production. She's usually good at containing her smothering worrying about my life, but it occasionally surfaces and I have to explain why it's unnecessary. She can be a bit harshly judgemental and impatient with others, but I can calm her temper with a few words and probably a gentle grip on her shoulder. She's also not the best at keeping promises, but I can also be guilty of that.

She's loving without being unbearably clingy, witty and silly, commiserates with me about the lesser beings around us, provides fun, fluffy conversation about mutual interests but can also provide serious support and valid arguments, understands that I need my space sometimes and doesn't take it personally. I make sure I express my love frequently and my gratitude occasionally, and we never really run into a lot of issues. She lets me be my own person and respects me as an adult most of the time. It probably helps a lot that we agree on most things, but we're both honourable enough to discuss our differences objectively to try and understand the other person's perspective.

If I met a man like my mother I would probably marry him. I also say I would marry myself as a man, though, which would probably be an unproductive mess. The ENFP seems to provide the stability and motivation that the INTP lacks.

Advice? Give your INTP space when they're upset, accept their love graciously without being over the top, ask if they need help and accept it without further comment when they say no, don't take it too hard when our words are sharp, and just be your sweet, understanding lovely self so that we can love you for you.",1381001341,"she's warm and friendly, but doesn't put up with bullshit.","warm and friendly","friendly",NA,FALSE,"warm and friendly","warm",NA,NA,0

"cci92oq","I've lived in six (of Canada's ten) provinces, and have visited every province for at least two months. I've noticed that (we) Canadians tend to take ourselves too seriously and are often sanctimonious - especially in relation to Americans. These two traits are *not* very funny, and often stand in the way of good-natured humour. That said, once you get past the initial standoffish nature of many Canadians, we tend to be an oddly funny bunch. 

I agree that many Canadians tend to appreciate straight-faced sarcasm, although I think a big part of that is the pride associated with being in on the joke rather than finding the joke inherently funny. As [burgundyjoe](http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueAskReddit/comments/1nfp9f/how_would_you_describe_your_countrys_sense_of/#cci6q4c?context=2) points out, self-deprecating humour is common and highly regionalised. 

I think a lot of Canadians are too aloof to be outright '*funny*' - we're often friendly but seldom affable. We want our comedy to come from professionals (hence the success of ""Just for Laughs,"" etc.), and tend to be more comfortable with a general sense of content acceptance to strong humour. 

All this to say, most Canadians seem unaware the they have a metaphorical stick lodged in their metaphorical butt, which leads to the sarcasm and contained interpersonal relation (most notably among strangers!). You're much more likely to offend a Canadian without knowing it that someone from just about any other predominantly English or French speaking nation. And if you've offended someone, they aren't likely to appreciate your humour.

That's what I like to do when I'm around people I have to be around like co-workers or friends of friends and they for some reason don't understand the concept of personal space. I say it in a friendly but firm voice so they know I'm serious but not angry. It's totally fine to get angry if they keep disrespcting you by getting too close or touching when it's not welcome.

You could also tell your roommate that while you're happy that he's found someone, his SO's energy is just kinda overwhelming for you and if maybe he could pass along that message. The message shouldn't be ""Back off and leave WhiteDiabla alone forever."" since extrovert guy hasn't done anything to warrant being banished from your life but it should be something like ""WhiteDiabla likes to chill and be alone for the most part when she's at home. Try to give her some space and let her have her quiet, please."" There's not really any way he could be offended by that and it's a really reasonable request. After all, when he visits your apartment he's not there to see you specifically so it makes sense to set some boundaries.

Good luck!

**Ruby**

Brainstorming: friendly but elegant, Japanese, strong association with red

Ruby is an elegant language, so a short drink would be better than a long drink for it. I feel that ""friendliest"" cocktail template for beginners is the sour, and the Jack Rose is a great sour that already happens to be red. So for a Ruby cocktail, I'd take the Jack Rose and give it a Japanese twist, swapping out the grenadine in favor of plum syrup (when I think ""delicious Japanese alcohol"", plum wine immediate comes to mind) and replacing the apple brandy with Japanese whiskey:

* 2 oz whiskey (preferably Japanese, e.g. Yamazaki), or maybe shōchū
* 1 oz lemon juice
* 3/4 oz plum syrup (for example, this recipe: http://savannahcocktailclub.com/2012/08/29/plum-bliss-plum-syrup-with-star-anise/) 

Shake and double-strain into a cocktail glass or coupe. Garnish with a star anise pod.

**Python**

Brainstorming: general-purpose, focus on readability, ""one obvious way to do it"", sense of humor, Dutch, snake

Since there's ""one obvious way to do it"", the classic genever sour is the way to go. Genever is the perfect liquor for Python - not only it is Dutch, but it's malty like whiskey and junipery like gin: it's a multi-paradigm spirit, just like Python is a multi-paradigm language!

* 2 oz genever
* 1 oz lemon juice
* 1/2 oz simple syrup
* 1 egg white

Dry-shake then shake with ice and double-strain into a cocktail glass or coupe. Garnish with a dash of snakeroot bitters, if you can find them.

I may add more as I think of them.

EDIT: A couple more.

**Perl**

Brainstorming: ""more than one way to do it"", glue language, difficult to understand, symbols: camel and onion, ""postmodern""

Since ""there's more than one way to do it"", a perfect drink for Perl would be one that simultaneously fits more than one standard formula, preferably in an obscure, difficult-to-understand way. How about a drink that fits both the 3:2:1 spirit:sour:sweet formula and the 2:1:X spirit:vermouth:other formula? Let's see, if we have 1.5 oz of base spirit, we would need 1.0 oz of sour agent and 0.5 oz of sweetener, but 0.75 of the above should fit into the aromatized wine category. To fit it all together, let's use 0.5 oz of sweet vermouth (vermouth + sweet) and 0.25 oz of a bitter aperitif like Cocchi Americano, or maybe even Punt e Mes (vermouth + ""sour"", well, bitter, but close enough).  That leaves 0.75 oz of sour to be occupied by citrus. Though I didn't intend this, the result actually isn't too different from what's already in the original submission:

* 1.5 oz gin
* 0.75 oz lime juice
* 0.5 oz sweet vermouth
* 0.25 oz Cocchi Americano

Shake and double-strain into a cocktail glass or coupe. Garnish with a cocktail onion.

**C**

Brainstorming: low-level, Bell Labs (NJ)

When I think ""low-level cocktail"", the Old Fashioned immediately springs to mind. As it happens, New Jersey, the home of Bell Labs, is also the birthplace of applejack, which would be interesting to see in a traditional cocktail. As the sweetener, I'd use maple syrup, which goes well with apples and adds an interesting sweetness, reminding the drinker that while C is a low-level, bare-metal language, it certainly beats working with assembly (which I guess would be straight-up liquor, by this analogy). 

* 2 oz Laird's bonded apple brandy
* 1-1.5 tsp maple syrup
* 2 dashes orange bitters

Build in an old-fashioned glass and stir. Optionally, add ice.

**Lisp**

Brainstorming: family of languages, long history, ties to AI, recursion, homoiconicity, lambda, poor reputation (though undeservedly so), unusual syntax

Well, I'm stumped on this one.

My experience is great so far. I'm not willing to go into much detail about the college I'm going into, or where exactly I am, but I can tell you a few things.

I'm in the US. The college I go to is pretty awesome. Theirs around 5,000-10,000 students enrolled. Most of the people are fairly nice and friendly, and the Professors are awesome. Classes are small in the college I go to, around 30 +/-. This isn't the typical college/university where you'd have a class of 300+/- students in a lecture and a Professor won't even know your face, let alone your name. 

Enrollment into classes is super easy, and dropping them is even easier. Once you're enrolled into a university/college though, its like a club. Their are a ton of free things offered - GYM is free, Tutoring is for free (for all subjects! - Students &amp; Professional Tutors!). They have a ton of scholarships that nobody even takes advantage of. Clubs and Associations are awesome, and also offer scholarships. My college even helps you find a job, will help you make a resume, and all that good stuff. Theirs also seminars (free), conferences (free), and some on campus activities (mostly free). What else is their to say? College is just awesome, it is the complete opposite of high school. 

If you're coming to study in the US, remember to be open. Americans are some of the most open and welcoming people that I've met. That doesn't necessarily mean friendly, but they're open to hearing from you. Also, when joining college in the US, join clubs that interest you, and make sure they are active - also good for your reports/resume. You'll also make lots of friends from said clubs. Stay active, but at the same time stay focused on your college work. They'll also break your bank in most cases, so keep a lookout for those scholarships that I talked about earlier (apply to each one you're eligible for - even if you don't think you'll be accepted!). College is where you'll make lifelong friends, so use that time to network and have fun. Keep everything in moderation, attend your lectures, and you'll do fine.

Maybe you'd be better off finding a company compatible with your personality? Everywhere isn't super corporate, after all. If you and the company are very well-matched for one another, you're advantaged against other candidates who might fit better in one of those corporate places.

Also, I, too, have ADHD. Right now, I am working in a very unstructured environment. In this environment, I absolutely need to have:

* A ""daily tasks"" list of little must-do things for the early morning and before leaving for the day. This may change week-to-week, or it may remain static for many weeks as I concentrate on a specific set of tasks.
* A notebook with a ton of blank paper. I write notes constantly, and when I start to feel overwhelmed by the number of scribbly pages, I go through everything and pull out the notes and tidbits that are still relevant. I cross everything else out in red, so it's very easy to see what's done and un-done. I prefer hand-writing because it's an easier visualization than a 20 page Word document sans organization.
* A general, always-updated document of ""little things"" I still need to finish, things waiting for other people's input, and otherwise unfinished things.
* Stickies and post-its on my monitor telling me what I need to do that is immediate and high-priority.
* A weekly document detailing what I've done with each day (written after the fact).

It helps, but still sometimes I'll spend five hours in a day working on something that isn't absolutely top priority, then realize there are better ways I could have spent my time. It's not a huge deal, though, due to the structuring of the environment. No one is breathing down my neck expecting me to complete X task in Y specified time via company-approved method Z described in procedure A2-91.20. Better than that, everyone is very casual, relaxed, and friendly -- but not in a forced way, either. It definitely works to my personality.

"cba9l17","Oh good, a non-throwaway. You shall have... a real critique. Remember, we're here to help, because we love you, bb.

That beard in pictures 2 and 3 is... something. It looks a lot better trimmed. I'd advise removing the body type and posting a more clear full body shot. Let her decide your body type. Opinions on this are mixed.

&gt; I'm a nerd that spends way to much time on a computer as a way to pass the time. If I have more important things to do (read: anything really) I have no problems getting off the computer. I enjoy programming, scripting and logic puzzles are a guilty pleasure of mine. I'm tall and friendly, but introverted and usually pretty quiet. I'm not hard to talk to, I just tend to shy away from initiating conversations. I know that's not ideal for online dating, thought I'd give it a try anyways.

One of the biggest things I'm always harping on with profiles are three simple words: *show, don't tell*. It borders on overused, but it's so compact and true! I don't want you to tell me you're a nerd, I want you to show me you're a nerd (with things like your anti-gravity joke! That was cute!). I'll end up coming back to this momentarily.

Oh, another thing I'm always yelling about: YOU ARE HERE TO SELL YOURSELF. This profile is marketing. The *fourth sentence* in your profile tells me you're a god damn boring-ass motherfucking shut-in. **Get rid of it.**

Anything that paints you in a negative light: DESTROY. Or rewrite it in a way that conveys your enthusiasm for whatever dorky thing to the reader. You spend a lot of time on computers? *Make computers sound fucking awesome.* I mean, they have *so many god damn transistors*, it blows my fucking mind, how can you not be excited about computers? *getthefuckoutofhere*

The way you talk about programming and script is boring. We know you're tall (sidebar), don't say you're introverted. Saying you're ""not hard to talk to"" has some negative associations with ""nice guys"" (*shudder*). Don't tell me you're a coward who won't start a conversation!

Don't tell me you're a coward! Don't tell me what's not ideal! SELL SELL SELL

&gt; I also like learning skills that are useful and have practical applications, like woodworking and home brewing.

Tell us about some cool things you've done with woodworking! Tell us about delicious beers you've beered! If your woodworking looked like a shitty pile of sticks and your beer tasted like dishsoap, crack light jokes about it! PUNCH IT UP, BRO.

You need more in your ""really good at"". Hell, I'd just add ""Growing a beard"".

&gt; I'd have to guess my height. Possibly my beard? Why not both?

Limp. Less limp: ""Definitely my height, but sometimes my beard. Hey, why not both?"" See the difference?

YOU MADE ME SO HUNGRY WITH THE FOOD THING. MORE OF THIS.

&gt; Coffee Mug (preferably filled with coffee), internet of some sort (with a device to use it), sunglasses, quiet time (usually referred to as alone time, but I don't necessarily need to be alone.), Google's services (Sure they know everything about me, but they're so handy!), Imagination!

Break this up into multiple lines. Mobile users can't see the bold. It's assumed you need a device to connect to the internet, silly.

&gt; just about anything really.

Means nothing. *Remove*.

&gt; Usually at home, watching a film and relaxing. The typical is liable to change though. Depending if I have friends from home (read: Yellowknife) in town I'm usually out at the pub.

The ""typical"" line is awkward and says nothing. Remove it. This question is hard (Because everyone is ""sometimes I'm in, sometimes I'm out""). Describe an *ideal* night, and an ideal night alone!

Your private thing is light and fun. Good job!

&gt; My weirdness hasn't warded you away and you actually find it endearing.

**NO.** BAD, OP. BAD. Do not tell me you're weird (weird=creepy), do not tell me what to find endearing.

&gt; Or if you would like to play a game of chess. I haven't played in years but I like the idea of playing against random people.

This is good! It's a date suggestion. Add what're you looking for in a woman. Provide some hooks if you can (things a woman could message you on (maybe you like haikus. suggest a haiku. I don't know, this isn't a tutorial)).

Final verdict: some good material, some stuff that needs to be completely scrapped. Get photos doing phone stuff with friends (go to a museum, a baseball game, a concert, something).

The Critique Copypasta: Read the sidebar on Rules 1 and 2 if you haven't. Also pay attention to the profile games posted on this sub. Some of the regulars have very compelling profiles.

"cba9iaf","I'd go for the 3rd picture as your display picture, you look much happier and approachable than the first one. Although, when designating the picture as your display, make sure it's cropped just on you so there's no confusion as to who the profile is for (res of pic might need to be bigger too). Also wouldn't hurt to have a coupla pics of you doing things (whether it's playing a sport, sitting around a table with family/mates, taking a hike). When posting pictures to OKC, it' not so much about ""looking attractive"" as it is ""attracted to being around you"". Also, scrap the 2nd picture - beard looks awfully long and ""neck-beardy"" in that one. Your beard looks much nicer and well-groomed in the first picture.

Ah... I hate puns, I had a friend in high school that would constantly over-do puns and now they're ruined for me. But that's just me. I'd probably keep it, adds a bit of spice.

""I'm tall and friendly, but introverted and usually pretty quiet. I'm not hard to talk to, I just tend to shy away from initiating conversations. I know that's not ideal for online dating, thought I'd give it a try anyways."" - I don't think you would be misrepresenting yourself if you got rid of that second and third sentence I quoted. While you want to be upfront in the fact that you're quiet and reserved, I'm just concerned that the latter part of that quote sounds like you're selling yourself short.

Your ""self-summary"" and ""what I'm doing with my life"" would perhaps be better served with a bit less descriptions of your character/attributes and more description of your behaviour/things that you. ""YOU NEED TO SHOW US WHAT YOU'RE LIKE"" - is a criticism you often hear on profile critiques of this subreddit. e.g. ""My natural habitat is my home-office and the computer labs at my university where I can be found toiling on A or playing B. Alternatively I can be found at C cafe or X Pub, catching up with friends, or doing Y or Z"" -  something along those lines. 

You should also try and express a bit of variety in your interests/hobbies - there's been a lot of reference to computing and the internet which I'm sure are an integral part of your life - but if you have hobbies and interests beyond that, you should show them. They may be hard to think of at times, but I guarantee you they're there  (e.g. you mention film and film scores, are you a movie buff? You also mention cooking, what about that? Do you like Hiking? Skiing? you get my drift). By only displaying this aspect of your life, you also run the risk of sounding like a workaholic (although, I don't think this is quite the case, it sounds like you are pretty driven to succeed in your field - maybe mention that explicitly? Gotta strike a delicate balance).

""I'm working on completing the DMIT program at NAIT"" - are these acronyms going to be readily apparent to a typical woman in your city? if not, make it explicitly clear.

""I'm also a great cook."" - signature dish or style of cooking you enjoy most? maybe spice it up, just makes it seem a little less bland. e.g. ""I'm also a great cook, I make a mean Roast Grizzly Bear"" - or whatever it is you Canadians eat. If you see opportunities to elaborate with something mildly amusing, do it (within reason, one pun is enough) - makes the profile more interesting.

While you're looking for a long-term relationship, I'd also consider putting short-term dating on your profile too, it's kind of inherent to the nature of online dating (ask anyone of these weary souls).

In spite of these constructive criticisms, I think you've got a really great profile, now build on it! 

All the best!

(Professional sub for 7 years here.)

Also, you probably will do it and it's not bad for consistency, depending on the district. The less money the district has, likely the less you'll work. Here's my tips.

1. Leave good notes. A sub who leaves good detailed notes about how the lessons went, what students asked which questions, etc etc will get lots of return work.

2. Be friendly, but strict. If you let a class get away with something once, they'll expect it from all subs every time.

3. Be aware of the school's needs and be willing (contract dependent) to help out places that aren't just classrooms (cover additional classes on your conference, etc.) LAUSD subs don't get conference periods and are expected to report to the main office during a teacher's regular conference period. Sometimes they'll tell you to return to the classroom and await instruction there. Don't expect to get a free period.

3. Have a good flyer/Business cards are useless. Use your word processor to create an attractive flyer with all of your pertinent information on it. Teachers will put these on their desks/in their calendars and use you if you make it easy for them.

4. INCENTIVES. I know I'm poor, but I also know teachers pay a shit ton out of pocket for supplies. Put on your flyer that the first 5-10 teachers to book you for the school year will receive a pack of pens or a ream of paper or something along those lines. It'll cost you a little out of pocket, but it gets the ball rolling at the beginning of the year when work can be very slow.

I was accepted to Cal.

I chose UCLA partly because I liked the area around campus significantly better than Cal.  Maybe I'm a bit sheltered/snobbish, but the area around Berkeley was a little bit too ""big city"" - interpret that as you will.  
Cal just didn't feel as comfortable to me when I toured the campus.  All the students seemed stressed and it's supposedly a very competitive school.  It was a pretty campus, but it felt small, disconnected, and wasn't the atmosphere I wanted.

UCLA offered a lot more - the top athletic tradition in the nation (which to me translated into a lot of big ""game day"" school spirit), an incredibly beautiful campus, an internationally-renowned academic tradition, a friendly but vibrant neighborhood, and most of all a sense of pride.

People who have visited from other campuses often comment on this, but at UCLA EVERYONE wears UCLA gear.  There's an enormous sense of pride in going to UCLA and being part of the academic, athletic, and innovative tradition of the school.  Sure, we might not rank as high as Cal in some disciplines, but college is about more than just that - it's about the experience you get from it.  I couldn't imagine being anywhere else, and that's how I know I chose the right university.  

UCLA has given me incredible and unrivaled opportunities: I've been to Illinois, Oregon, Washington, Utah, Texas, San Francisco, San Diego, and China.  I've connected with students from across the state, across the country, across the continent, and across the globe.  I've had countless doors opened because of the name of my school.  Even halfway across the world in Xi'an, China, people recognize the four letters of UCLA.  Going to UCLA is a big deal; ""Bearwear"" (UCLA Clothing) is a designer label in several different countries.  Almost 100,000 people applied to UCLA last year, more than any other university.  

I can honestly say that choosing UCLA was the best decision of my life.
Yes, going to college anywhere is a privilege and will likely be an incredible, life-changing experience.  However I cannot imagine myself being happier anywhere else.

http://isteve.blogspot.com/2013/06/ask-swede.html

From his post titled: Last part, number 7

""I hope you could get a better understanding of Swedes and Sweden. It's a very hard country to pigeonhole and stereotype, precisely because so many of our social codes and norms are never spoken. This is one of the many reasons why it's much easier, at least for a willing, pro-social (as in behaviour) and smart immigrant, to assimilate in America than it is in Sweden.

One of these many unstated norms is just how tied Swedishness is to whiteness, but there are many, many other examples that bedevils even other white ethnics. I read one guy's blog (notice the social distance here) who said that even as a white American living in Norway for over 15 years most Swedes hesitated to call him a Swede or even say hello to him on the their equivalent to the 4th of July, still seeing him as a foreigner. He said that this wasn't done with hostility, just with a reticence. There was an inseparable line between him and them. They were friendly towards him, very polite, but there was still a space between them that couldn't be exaplained away. A lot of tourists do think this is introversion and to some extent it is, but it's more than this.

We take pride in being nice to you, but don't mistake our natural introversion for interest in you but inability to get to know you, sometimes we're just not that into you to begin with!

'Friendly, but distant' is how one Anglo (as in British) observer wrote in the English press in the early 1970s, still holds true today. There's even a book about Sweden which is probably as close to Sweden's Tocqueville as you could get, although in this case it was a British journalist who lived in Sweden and made careful notes about what he deemed the most complicated and maddening culture he had ever been to with a myriad of unstated norms and rules that were invisible to the outsider(and nobody ever bothering to tell him).

I don't remember it right now, but I'd wager most people here wouldn't be interested in it unless you're were a deeply pro-Europhile who love to learn all the quirks about all European people (and you'll most likely need to live in Europe to have that interest) so I'll leave it at that.""",1373350742,"'friendly, but distant' is how one anglo (as in british) observer wrote in the english press in the early 1970s, still holds true today.","friendly, but distant","friendly","but",TRUE,"friendly , but distant","distant",NA,NA,1

Put in any special accomplishments during school/uni. Maybe you earned some awards or participated some working groups etc...Maybe you volonteered or wrote interesting paper/theses.

Learn about the company you are applying to. As much info you can get. Look for their mission, policy etc. AND SET YOUR MIND TO THAT. You don' t want to tell them ""i'll  do any job because I need money"". I.e. (banal example but you´ll get it) if you´re applying for well known fast food chain, you wont say ""i need a job, so i applyed"". You will learn about their mission and say ""I always dreamt to be a part of team that offers their customers food made of freshest, best quality ingredients. The team that strives to listen to the needs of their customers and offer them healthiest meals, fun, and whole family experience..."" I hope you get the picture.

There are many examples for CVs online so check that out. Be polite, tidy, friendly but natural. Don´t act too polite or give fake smiles because people wil see through you and nobody likes a phony. Shake hands firmly. Look into people´s eyes.

Never lie in your CV or interview. 

Be serious. I saw an application for pet shop job saying ""I always loved animals and I have a very cute maltese"" Don´t do that. Maybe you can say that during interview if they ask, but rather write ""As a consumer myself, I´m very interested in pet product industry"".

"carxhg5","I don't own them but I've worked with them.

If you've never had a bird before I would say go with the conure. If you have, expect the lorikeet to require more attention that what you are used to.

Someone else mentioned the poop, so I'll just say of birds, its the worst. I've never seen one take to potty training but I've heard its not too hard to do given the right bird.  

Life span is longer than a conure as well, up to 30 years. 

Food is a pain. Nectars are more expensive than pellet mixes, and need to be prepared at least twice daily. More if the bird is young. 

Temperament: Lorikeets are so friendly and so comical. Not the smartest bird out there, but that just adds to how cute they are. Depending on the bird they can be mildly to aggressively cuddly. However if you can't give them the attention they need (multiple hours a day) then they can be grumpy bossy and a bully. 

Conures comparatively are usually just friendly. But less comical in my opinion, and less active. Yes... conures are less active. Crazy sounding I know. But Lorikeets are crazy active, from all the nectar. 

Hope this helps.

"cao1xaj","You should expect regular reviews and the agenda should include four topics:

1. A review of your performance objectives from the last review - both positive and negative results. Did you learn what you were supposed to learn? Did you do what you were supposed to do? Are you a cooperative team player? Do you set a good example for others to follow? Are you reliably on time, ready to go? How are your interactions with the service staff? Etc.

2. Set new performance objectives. Be as specific as possible and *always* set a time frame for each objective. It can be as simple as ""stop being late as of today"" to something as complex as ""be prepared to work the XX station, including fippling the dorfel, as of the first of next month.""

3. Compensation. If you exceed objectives or advance in skills/performance, you should expect a raise. Jobs are like rocks: sometimes they're stepping stones on a path to bigger and better things and sometimes they're just dead weight dragging you down. If the boss won't give you a raise when you're contributing more, you decide whether or not (and if not now, when) it's time to bail and move on. Small raises are always easier to get than big ones so try for four small raises each year instead of one big one. Usually you'll come out ahead. Can you structure some of your compensation in the form of one time payments? Maybe a bonus for developing the skills and moving to a new station or for contributions to managing food costs or...

4. Set a new date for your next performance review. You should have some kind of formal review at least quarterly and 5 minute reviews at least monthly. In between (like weekly) you should ask questions as they come up. 

Take control. It's work, not play, and it isn't always supposed to be easy or fun but it isn't supposed to be punitive, either. Be positive and friendly but it's just a job and if it isn't rewarding it's time to look for another one.

"cagiprf","I love dogs, I grew up with a Dog.. and if I was single, I could see myself with a dog.

However I can't fucking stand owners that let their dogs off their leash, and it happens a LOT around my area.

Most of the dogs are fine, they're great little dogs that just want to sniff, or lick someone. Yea, that's great and all, but not everyone is a dog lover. My wife had a traumatic experience with a dog when she was little and doesn't like them.

My elderly grand aunt got bit on the leg by a random dog on the street.

and my Nephew was at a backyard bar-b-cue at a friend of my brothers. Their ""friendly and loving"" dog bit him and scratched him.

There is a local playground near me, and I have seen people walk by it with their dogs off their leashes. It's not right. Kids are small, even a medium sized dog is like a bear to them. It's perspective people, and often times kids have not been around animals to understand ""good"" vs ""bad"".

When my first born was little, I was walking with her hand in hand down the sidewalk. We came to a house where a golden lab was sitting out front, the owner was in the backyard. The dog looked at us, and ran over to us. I immediately scooped up my daughter in my arms and prepared to kick this animal hard if it tried anything.

It came by and sniffed me and I kept walking, it eventually turned around and left. Then the owner came out and didn't seem to give a shit what was going on.

But more recently, a couple weeks ago I was walking with my other daughter who is only 2. We walked down this street and a lady was washing her car, her dog was running up and down her property and around the car without a leash. I saw this and immediately thought this would be a situation because the dog was a bit hyper. I got my daughter in my hands who was already saying ""dog... dog"" in a nervous voice.

The dog comes racing over to us when the owner's back is turned. Again, it wasn't really being hostile, just hyper-friendly. But my daughter didn't know that.

I have never heard her (or her sister for that matter) scream in such terror before. She was in a great state of panic as this large dog came charging at us. I turned my back on the dog and immediately tried to sooth her and walk away.

The owner hearing the screams immediately called it's dog back and began punishing it. I considered if I should say anything, because it's her own god damn fault that she left her dog off a leash and running wild. It's not the dog's fault.

Take a notebook and pen so when you are learning their systems you can take notes as you are trained. This looks prepared and organised.

Smile at everyone. It's ok to tell people you're a bit nervous at first, it will make them want to look after you but don't overdo it!

Don't, under any circumstances, go into detail about previous bullying - if there is someone who can be a bully there you will be marking yourself out as a victim. No one messes with someone unless they think they can get away with it.

Be friendly but take your time to get to know them before you decide who you can trust. If it's appropriate, do nice things. I was the boss and I never made myself a cup of coffee without making everyone else one. Keep an eye open for how their system works - little things can make you part of the team in no time.

Be brave! You've got a lot to be confident about, experience in more than one working environment, a really good attitude and brilliant communication skills from looking at your writing and your interview success. Just pretend to be confident and soon you will be.

In more recent years, many consumers have made it clear that they greatly appreciate individualism in their purchases, as well as human effort in the production process. I think you, and any other craftsmen, would do extremely well to PUSH this point home in your everyday dealings, advertising, and your work. I don't know if you've ever seen those John Newman ""Birth of a Tool"" videos, but they are an example of EXTREMELY intelligent marketing. They show the that craftsman has a personal place in every level of the making of the product, definitely give them a watch if you're thinking about serious advertising

Following on from that, get into making some media content! If you're going to get online (which I highly recommend), then you'll need a high resolution camera to get good still images of your work. Also, videos are a great way to show what you can do... People LOVE blacksmithing videos, and if you make them available for your potential consumers, the attraction will grow. 

Look at your competitors. It's unlikely you'll have other smiths in your area, as far as I know they're fairly few and far between, but that doesn't mean you can't research existing smithing operations online or over the phone. See how they advertise, and what looks best, and change your methods to be the same. 

Lastly, I feel like the most important thing for a smith to be concerned about if they want to make a living is great communication through advertising. Oh, did I mention that already? That's because it's REALLY IMPORTANT! People must know what sets a traditional, hand forged item from a factory machined one. Because sadly, you will be on the wrong end of price competitiveness. And rightly so, your work is worth more, but you'll need to make your customers astutely aware of the value of your hand made metalwork. 

 I'm afraid I don't have much to offer in terms of production tips, but what I can suggest is to make tools with a nice balanced mix of utility and artistry, so that your work, while fulfilling a purpose, can also be an expression of individuality. I guess this means you'll need to learn more detailed work, and possibly metal marking techniques like etching. Maybe take a sketching/drawing/painting class!

So, advertise like crazy, and never underestimate the power of the Internet for this purpose. You know, Facebook, viral videos and the like.",1368581879,"disclaimer: i'm not a practicing blacksmith yet, nor do i expect to be making a living from it anytime soon, so take my words as being friendly but uneducated advice :)  it's a good question, i hope it gets noticed.","friendly but uneducated","friendly","but",FALSE,"friendly but uneducated","uneducated",NA,NA,1

"c9yuv27","I just came from Panama. 

The city is great, but unless you want casinos and hotels much of its charm is in Casco Viejo, the colonial district. If you want cheap accommodation, Luna's Castle in Casco is a converted 19th century Spanish mansion turned into a hostel. Clean, friendly, $13 a night with pancakes and fruit in the morning. There's also really good gelato in Casco (Avenida B), a nice little cafeteria on Avenida Central (Nelson's) amongst the street food vendors, and the fish market has red snapper for like a dollar. Don't walk anywhere you don't see militarised policemen, ESPECIALLY around Ancon Hill which is a major ghetto called Chorrillo. If you see the buildings start to look [like this](https://www.google.com/search?safe=off&amp;q=chorrillo%20panama%20city&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=701&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;hl=en&amp;tbm=isch&amp;source=og&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=wi&amp;authuser=0&amp;ei=yrqSUaqmE4X89gT19ICwBg), which is possible if you stray too far north from Casco, you want to immediately turn back. 

Colon CITY is a bad place to be, lots of robberies, but Colon PROVINCE is a fantastic spot on the Caribbean. Visit Portobelo and stay at Captain Jack's ($13/n, great but relatively expensive restaurant, the bartender Daniella is a gem). Drink at Pablo's, near the warehouses, for $1 beers. Balboa is the best beer in the country, Panama and Atlas taste like piss. In order to get to Portobelo, go to Albrook Terminal and take the chicken bus (converted school buses painted with absurd shit) to Sabanitas, walk to the other side of Supermercado Reys, and then take the chicken bus with Portobelo written on the windscreen. 

In Portobelo, there's a tiny restaurant next to the discotec with the menu written on the wall. Menu es pollo. Really good, you can barter down to $3 for a full meal. You can also take a second chicken bus to La Guyara, further north by around half an hour, and from there take a water taxi to Isla Grande for roughly $2.50. Isla Grande isn't much, but there's good ceviche (mixed fish and onion cooked in lime juice, eaten on crackers) and at the far end is a resort called Sister Moon which has a fantastic view and moderately expensive beer. Don't fuck with Captain Jack or give him any reason to dislike you. He's a New Jersey mobster who runs a boat line between Portobelo and Colombia where happy tourists go to Cartagena and large amounts of cocaine come back to Panama. Those warehouses on the docks, don't go near those. Don't buy drugs from anyone in the town, they'll run off with your money.  

Between Portobelo and La Guyara is a town called Puerto Lindo. If you want quiet, that's the place to go. There's an American there named Sarah who runs an illegal hostel at $8 a night, she's crazy as fuck-all but has a really nice dog named Lavi and a parrot. Your other option would be on the other side of the bay, a restaurant ran by a Dutch guy named Hans. I'm not sure how much that costs. Puerto Lindo doesn't have much, but there's an Italian restaurant that's apparently pretty good, Hans' which has great fish and pork ($6-10), and a mountain behind Hans' that is filled with killer bees but a great climb. You may meet a man named Luciano, the fisherman who supplies the town's fish. Don't ask him about his dog, but if you hear anything about a dog it's me they're talking about and I'm so fucking glad I did it. If you meet a toothless drunk man, he's overly friendly but harmless. Just a bit touched in the head. 

**Boquete**. You need to visit Boquete. Take the bus from Panama City to David, then take the bus from David to Boquete. Buses in Panama are very cheap. Chicken buses will get you anywhere for a quarter in cities and several dollars out of cities (the trip to Portobelo will be around $5). The bus to David, which is also your stop off to Almirante (Bocas del Toro's mainland village), will be around $15 if you don't take the express one, which saves about an hour. Boquete is a mountain town which is absolutely beautiful. In the town there are wildflowers everywhere and a great cafeteria where you can get a full meal for $3, above the town is a huge volcano which is a 15km hike but has unbelievable views. 

Bocas doesn't have much unless you're into pubhopping. Hostal Pukalani (spelling may be off) on the far end of the bay is safe and clean, and near the cemetery is an American-run empanada place which has $1 gourmet empanadas and $3 hamburgers that are to die for. Otherwise food in Bocas Town is priced for foreigners and I don't recommend it. 

Apparently the Azuro Peninsula, Chitre and Isla Iguana and the like, is the gem of the country, but I didn't visit it. You might also try the Pearl Islands, very expensive, or the closer chain whose name escapes me. Panamanians take day trips there, it's around $30 for the boat. 

Don't get in the way of the cops, ignore the crazy people, and be mindful that the average yearly income is around $10.000. Flashing wealth, especially in poor neighbourhoods, is a bad idea. Also, the street food is universally safe and if you see red potatoes hollowed out and filled with pulled pork they are amazing and you should eat all of them. At the end of Avenida Central at the bus stop you'll find one stand that sells them. 

Oh, and cheap fruit. Never pay above 75 cents for a pineapple, 50 cents for a coconut, or a dollar for a watermelon. All of them taste amazing. 

edit: Taxis. You need to understand taxis. If you arrive via Tocuman Airport, don't take the taxis outside. They're $30 or more to get into the city. Take the bus. Taxis in Panama are extremely cheap, between $2-10 across the city. Put your hand out at waist level to summon one, negotiate the price beforehand (expect a gringo discount, doubling the price natives would pay), and don't be alarmed if they reject you whilst simultaneously be willing to reject them if the price isn't in line with what you want. Always make sure you know the price before you get in.

"c9yucdu","Raccoons around here used to come eat cat food on the porch when we were out there smoking.. we ignored them for weeks, and the group (3) eventually decided we weren't a threat, and would stroll right up to us after that.  They would eat from our hands, allow us to pet their heads, and even come to your hand if you made little clicky noises, or ""gyet"" when we told them to.   I always thought they were just emulating the cats, seeing how they got along and following suit.   I never fully trusted them, but wasn't scared.    
One night, I go outside to find 5 baby coons, each about the size of my  hand.  Momma is nowhere to be seen, and they are just climbing in and out of the food and water dishes.  I cannot resist, and sit down on the porch and immediately commence to cuddling the little bastards.  Very friendly and playful, just like kittens, and they all end up crawling on my shoulders and lap.  
After about 15 minutes of this, showing everyone else in the house and many AWWWWWWs,  momma coon comes waddling up to the porch.  Not gonna lie, I was scared.  But it turns out she was one of the ""regulars"",  she recognized me, and calmly walked up and checked/licked each baby, got a quick drink of water, and gave me a look like ""will you watch these guys for a bit?"" ... slinked back off into the night to get away from the kids for a while.
 I continue to play with the babies and feed them grapes for another hour or so until they all fall asleep in a little pile next to the door.  
Momma eventually comes back to retrieve them, and the happy family trots away.    Not all coons around here are that friendly, but some are quite agreeable.

"c9s1lah","With something like a CD store, I think you've really gotta bring something to the table that other places can't. I mean, you can beat big stores like Best Buy easily simply by offering fewer ""mainstream"" CDs and more under-the-radar stuff.

The problem is that you don't want to come across - dare I say it? - too *hipstery* for fear of isolating that big customer-base who wants to branch out from top 100 but doesn't really know a lot about other music. It's really easy to alienate people who don't know a lot about something and don't want to feel embarrassed about it by asking. You have to be knowledgeable, but not a ""know-it-all"". You have to be warm and friendly, but avoid sounding condescending, like you're babying them. It's a fine line.

And what about online? Why wouldn't I just buy a CD or record from amazon? You can't really beat their prices by any game-changing margin. And they have comments and recommendations for similar artists, too.

My vote for setting yourself apart is listening booths. Areas for people to listen to music before they buy it. Big dry-erase boards that you change weekly all over the store with dozens of rows of ""IF YOU LIKE (well known band here), MAY WE SUGGEST (lesser known bands here)"". Have a very eclectic playlist going in the store all the time (not very loud, but loud enough for people to stop and listen a second). Make it clear that asking about EVERYTHING is encouraged, but don't be a lap dog. Let people explore. 

I'm just babbling at this point. I love locally owned stores where the owner is passionate about what s/he does so much, so I always get excited when someone talked about anything like that.

These depend on the existence of a database. Unless you plan on hand coding them from the ground up you need a CMS.


CMS:

* Wordpress is beginner friendly but inflexible. Use this for small single purpose sites or blogs. Large amount of widgets. Many themes but usually inflexible.

* Joomla is a bit harder to gasp but extremely flexible. You need a site for a web application to design stuff, a store to sell designed and/or premade stuff, a forum and a blog? Use this. Medium amount of modules(fontend) and components(backend). Decent amount of templates, really easy to design from the ground up.

* Drupal ~~is hard. It can be literally anything if you know how to hand code it. Also it's hard. You use this if you need to make things that would make other cms crumble. Oh did I mention that it's hard?~~ You shouldn't even think about using this, just be aware it exists.

SEO. WP is better set from the get-go, Joomla needs a bit of tinkering but, again, is more flexible.

"c9d6vcc","I always think that I play MMOs for the wrong reasons. Specifically, I don't like PVP and I barely ever do group PVE quests. Part of this is that I'm actually more shy online than in real life. I'm pretty good at reading body language and being humorous and friendly, but on the internet, it drives me crazy not being able to tell how people are feeling without them specifically telling me (and even then, they could be lying).

Another part of it is that I'm married and have a toddler (with special needs, at that), so my free time is very limited and I mostly play at night. My son wakes up at least half the time, so I have to drop what I'm playing to comfort him.

So why do I play MMOs? I love gear progression - not just seeing the numbers go up, but going from basic gear to more and more impressive-looking armor and weapons. Games that allow you to upgrade older gear to keep them relevant or have custom appearance slots that let you override the look of whatever you're actually wearing are a LOT more fun to me because I can look exactly how I want to. Some of my favorite moments in MMOs are finding out which quests/enemies will have the gear pieces that I want and then completing my set.

While there's a lot of bad stuff to be said about the traditional MMO quest system (""collect 5 animal hides"", ""save 10 captured soldiers""), as someone with limited free time and near-constant interruptions, they work pretty well for me. Some nights I might be tired and only want to play for 30 minutes or so. These quests are usually pretty short, so I can get 2-3 of them done, see my experience and money go up a bit, and I can do more the next day. In the days when I was single and had TONS of leisure time, I would get bored of MMOs really quickly because I would get burnt out on the repetitive nature of questing.",1365705630,"i'm pretty good at reading body language and being humorous and friendly, but on the internet, it drives me crazy not being able to tell how people are feeling without them specifically telling me (and even then, they could be lying).","humorous and friendly","friendly",NA,FALSE,"humorous and friendly","humorous",NA,NA,0

"c99j4ay","Huzza biking!

Bikes come in sizes, it is usually either a ""Petite/Small/Medium/Large/XL/Tall/Jumbo"" or the like, or a number which is usually the distance from the center of the bottom bracket (where the pedals meet the frame) and the top of the seat post (where the seat post leaves the rest of the bike)..  I think Jumbo/Tall might be the other way around, they're both humongous

I HIGHLY recommend taking all sorts for test rides before you buy.  Friendly bike shops, co-ops, friends, and stranger-bike-enthusiasts (Hi!) will be helpful for that.

An important part of the test rides is finding out if you guys are comfortable with [drop bars.](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f1/Shimano_105-5500_shifters.jpg/699px-Shimano_105-5500_shifters.jpg)  They let you lean over and be more aerodynamic (helps a lot, actually) and give you lots of options for hand positions so you can get sore somewhere new.

Those will be on road bikes, touring bikes, and cyclocross bikes.

I won't talk much about road bikes because I'm pretty sure they don't fit your needs, but they're basically like below except optimized for speed on roads and only speed on roads, no accommodations for luggage/comfort/trails/etc.

Cyclocross bikes have drop bars, neato devices where the shifter and brake lever are one piece (picture above has them), are beefy enough to handle light trail usage, have clearance around the tires to fit fenders and wider tires if you so desire, cargo mounts (usually), the center triangle is open and the cables are not routed on the bottom of the top tube so they are easy and comfortable to carry on your shoulder.

I really like them.

Touring bikes have drop bars, sometimes have the integrated shifters but sometimes use shifters stuck in the bar ends.  It's up to you, personal preference.  They are strong enough to carry you and all your crap and have tons of mounts for cargo.

I'm thinking cyclocross or touring might be the way to go.  /r/bicycletouring is a friendly group, /r/cyclocross is friendly but more about their races than the bikes.

If you don't like the drop bars, you would probably want to look at something usually called a 'hybrid' or 'performance hybrid' but I think drop bars will serve your purposes much better.",1365223713,"i'm thinking cyclocross or touring might be the way to go.  /r/bicycletouring is a friendly group, /r/cyclocross is friendly but more about their races than the bikes.","friendly but more","friendly","but",FALSE,"friendly but more","more",NA,NA,1

"c8yx8q9","Few things.

-  Be smiley and stupid friendly, like baby talk cheesy in the shoot. Parents use that because kids respond to it (and it's annoying but it'll work). Kids are tuned into the tone of voices (like dogs), and any tone that isn't happy can set them down path of crying.

- You have about 20  minutes total before the kid crashes. Anything after that is a blessing. Keep this in mind when working. Work quickly.

- If parents are not in shots - keep them close and ask them to say nothing as the kid will look at them and not you. If they are on a shooting table, keep the parent close enough to catch the kid should the tip or fall. Kid falls, it'll cry at minimum. Injuries = lawsuits.  I hate to admit it but the parents can be a pain in the ass. Be friendly but firm when you ask them to do something be it don't make the kid smile at you (and end up looking away from you) or anything pertaining to safety. If that parent gets frustrated, game over. Kids read that. 

- Be stern as the parents will like to hop up and look at photos. Dont do that. Keep moving. 

- Check ahead for different outfits and plan accordingly. Remember, short, sweet, and fast.

- Variety is good. Get at least two or three different poses or setups (and a couple different backdrops isnt bad either). Get full body, 3/4 and close ups. Don't plan to crop post any more than necessary. Shoot these on their own. Google search different poses. Tummy shots, over the shoulder, arms crossed, etc.   

- Sometimes getting non-smile expressions are fun too. Big doe eyes are always cute. ABSOLUTELY no unhappy faces, snot bubbles, tears, or stupid expressions. Some photogs think they're funny at the moment, the parent will not.

I now live in Bozeman and don't make it back nearly enough, but word among the back-country folk is that the Northern Lights shut down, and the Merc no longer has their wide variety of delicious baked goods. :-( I hope neither are true, but even so I'd still love to find my way back up the Northfork road someday soon.

"c8ldi18","I have owned many cats as well as one dog. The dog was friendly, but destructive and as thick as a rock. I had begged my parents for him, but they eventually gave him to a family friend because we simply did not have the time to care for him in a way that would entertain him enough for him to stop literally chewing on our house when we were away. 

Now, if you have time for a dog, I can see how you might appreciate them, but I simply do not. I own two kitties right now and they are the light of my life! My older cat waits on the porch for me around the time I come home from work and the younger one is practically glued to my sides whenever I'm around. We play ""chase"" back and forth through the house where I chase him into a corner, then turn around and run away as he chases me. If I cry, they sit on my lap and, when I had a serious heart issue, the older cat (before I adopted my kitten) got super freaked out and tried to comfort me after. 

I love my cats because they come when I call, don't destroy anything when I'm gone, don't mind that I sometimes have to work 80 hour weeks and are just as happy watching me play video games as they are directly playing with me!

It's difficult to be calm and friendly outwardly, if you're not calm (and friendly) inwardly. This is why I suggest you move out and do something about that emotional baseline.

""Assertive"".. I find that assertiveness is an art. You can't be too pushy and you can't be too meek. The key, I find, is in seeing things in a third-person perspective, without your ""you-ness"" or ""her-ness"" changing how you evaluate things. Go back to your rights, and her rights, instead of how you feel about things. But basically the ""calm and friendly"" part is more important (and challenging).

Ask tons of questions, primarily about research and where professors see projects going, about things they are doing, about who is working in their lab, whether they see taking on new students. Ask everything you need to make an educated decision when hopefully you get offered a spot.

Show them that you are enthusiastic about the field. Prove to them that you truly love it. They want to see that you want to do the work to get through the program.

Talk to as many possible grad students as you can about everything really. Again be really friendly but remember you are still interviewing and being watched. So do not get lulled into being an ass. 

When possible follow-up. If a professor was not available to interview you, but may be attending a dinner or another event during the weekend approach them. This happened to me, and I spoke first to his grad students and some others and they went out of their way to get us together to talk. Same with asking if you might skype with a professor that was not available.

"c8276zv","Nothing.  There is nothing that anyone can say to alleviate depression.  All the platitudes and attaboys simply sound like inane bullshit.  There is simply nothing that anyone can say that matters.  You might as well ask what someone said that helped a multiple amputee grow their limbs back.

That being said, ""You will go to the doctor.  I won't take no for an answer "", was the best thing anyone said to me when I was in the grips of major depression.  The words didn't mean anything, but she extracted a promise from me that I would go, and I delivered on my promise.  It was a good thing I went.

I was prescribed an SSRI, and the difference was immediate. It's supposed to take weeks to feel the effects, but in my case it was about four hours after taking the first pill.  The next two years were quite amazing.  Food tasted better.  Sunlight gave me a total rush. I'd always been gregarious and friendly, but I actually began to feel interested in people. I am off the meds now, and I don't feel quite as ""happy""  but I am not depressed any longer.

There are a lot of people talking about therapy. I went to therapy, and it helped - but it wasn't the cure for depression.  I already knew about self-talk, reinforcing positive habits, all that.   Therapy helped me identify some things that were affecting my behavior and choices.  But the depression, the absolute not caring if I lived or died, not caring about anything at all, not caring that I was depressed - that required medication.  I was literally biochemically incapable of feeling reward, incapable of feeling punishment, so behavioral therapies would have been completely ineffective.   You can't punish someone who literally doesn't care.

At one point I went to jail, and I was fine with that.  It was actually a relief to me, at least I wasn't failing to meet expectations anymore.  I didn't have to talk to anyone, I didn't have to go anywhere.   They could have kept me in for life, and I wouldn't have cared.

That's depression.  It's not sadness.  It's detachment from anything that matters to us as human beings.  You can still feel emotions, it's not sociopathy.  It's just that you don't care at all, and anything particularly good or bad is always pretty much ""meh"".  That's the big reason depressed people commit suicide. There's simply no reason to exist. I used to tell people, think of the worst, most horrible, most boring, most annoying TV show you can think of.  Do you watch it?  Hell no, you change the channel, right?  Suppose it's the same thing on every single channel.  Turn off the TV and do something else, right?  Nope.  Can't turn off the TV.  You are imprisoned, forced to watch - and it's worse than bad, it's boring.  It's torture. So you pull the plug.

A lot of us are good at hiding it.  Some of us self medicate with drugs and alcohol.  Others look happy, do all the right things, have a family, a house, a career.  Some get deeply into religion.  Some do endless volunteer work.  Some lay in bed all day.

"c7yqyrj","I've been an Audi fan (and former brand specialist) for years. However I had to do a buy-back on my RS4 Cab, and given the friendly but barely competent local dealer, I was left with a bitter taste in my mouth. Not wanting to revisit that whole debacle, I resolved to test drive the M3 sedan and quite possible ""join the enemy"". ;)

Found the perfect example, equipped just like I wanted (fiber fabric trim, manual, etc), used on a nearby BMW dealer lot. We had to flag down a salesperson, but soon got squared away on the test drive, which covered the usual commute route of highway, city street, and a bit of twisties. The salesguy was very pleasant and knowledgeable. However the ride on freeway chop was atrocious - especially in the back seat. We tried playing with the iDrive to set it to the comfort setting, but nothing fixed the severe bouncing in the back seat. When we hit the twisties, the stability control was having a really tough time trying to keep the car hooked up. I really wanted to like this car! I wanted this silly hunt to be over and done! Alas no. It just didn't tick off enough boxes to make the cut.

So I went down the street and test drove the ordinary V8 S4. Yeah, it didn't have the sublime brakes of the RS4, nor did it have the steering feel (S4 on par w/M3), and the engine didn't scream like an Italian mistress above 5000 rpms like the RS4. But it rode better than the M3, stayed hooked up better, cost significantly less, and I could take it skiing without having to take along chains. 

We didn't buy that car, but eventually tracked down a really low mile [25th Anniversary edition](http://i.imgur.com/Uez46.jpg). I've thrown on some lighter weight wheels and improved brake pads, but otherwise left the car stock. I still get ""fender envy"" when I see an M3 or RS4, but I remind myself that it's a daily and I have other stuff to play with on weekends. 

Do I wish the M3 had been better suited to my priorities? Absolutely! It would have been interesting to live with the other side of the coin.

"c7s5py8","Like someone else mentioned in the article, she's in a relationship with Ned Flanders. Clearly I'm arguing with one too.

And you're right. I don't get to decide what's normal. Neither do you. What I do get to decide though is if something is healthy or not. From this limited information exposure, the parent-child relationship here is very unhealthy. The level of dependency these kids have on their father is such that if the father was to suddenly die, it looks like they'd have absolutely no idea how to function. For kids 16 and under, that's alright. But to have an 18 year old act the way she's described it....it's not right. I'm a student worker for my college's IT department, and I had a co-worker who was very much helicopter parented. He had to call his parents, who were 7 hours away, to ask permission to go out for Pizza after work. He had the money. He had the car. He had the freedom, and yet he was wholly incapable of acting on his own. When it came to work, he literally only did whatever the bosses told him. There was no extra initiative put in. There was no commitment to better himself unless someone told him to do so. He was friendly, but unsocialized and extremely dependent, and everyone around him knew this, and some people tried hard to bust him out of his shell, but his lack of self-confidence and independence brought him back down, every single time. That's the kind of thing that this dependent parenting fosters.

Parents are supposed to raise kids who are able to ""fly the coop"" and be wholly 110% independent beings. That doesn't mean that they can't have a strong, loving relationship with their parents mind you, but it means that their parents are not supposed to be the gatekeepers for all their children's actions when it comes to a certain age. In this case, that's what it seems the father is doing, and it's setting those kids up for a much harder adult life unless something in that relationship dynamic changes. Judging from the other comments, this woman realizes this, and is frustrated with it, because she wants to see those kids become independent beings not only for their own health and success in life, but for her relationship as well. Honestly, there's nothing wrong with that at all, and by picking the counseling option, she's opting to voice her concerns with her husband in a structured, professional, safe environment . 

To bash someone for wanting to work out their issues and see if things are fixable (either on one end, the other, or both) before tossing in the towel is deplorable.",1357503519,"he was friendly, but unsocialized and extremely dependent, and everyone around him knew this, and some people tried hard to bust him out of his shell, but his lack of self-confidence and independence brought him back down, every single time.","friendly, but unsocialized","friendly","but",TRUE,"friendly , but unsocialized","unsocialized",NA,NA,1

"c7ou7kx","I've come to tell a story, not my own, but ex-roommates (we're still friends). The crazy happened to her before I moved in with her. I had a role in this mess too, so I hope from seeing my perspective you'll learn something.

Once upon a time, there was a girl named... Sam*. I had met Sam a couple of times in passing, and she seemed like an overly-friendly, but nice enough ""normal"" gal. I was often visiting this dorm room before I moved there because I had a couple of friends who lived on the second floor. The second time I spoke with Sam, she was upset. Apparently, she was having roommate problems. Being a nice person, I asked her what was wrong. She then told me she was terrified of her roommate (Jenny*). Jenny was short but fiesty, she said, and very controlling and could be mean. 

I'm going to stop here for a moment. The fact that someone confided this in me on our second encounter should have been a red flag. I also should have been more skeptical, but I was naive and trusting still.

When I asked Sam what Jenny had done, specifically, to upset her, she said some vague things about mean comments and moving her stuff. That didn't seem like a huge deal to me, but I comforted her and went on my way. Shortly after that, a spot opened up in this dorm room, and I moved there (my current one was too expensive, and way across campus). Sam had moved out of Jenny's room, and Jenny was my new roommate. Having heard the things that Sam said, I was wary of Jenny too. I was nice to her but on guard. When I met her myself, I told her that I was friends with Sam, even though I barely knew her, because I simply did not want to be involved with their roommate drama.

From that point on, we were downright hostile to each other. Civil, but hostile. Setting roommate rules was rough, but we finally got through it.

A month into sharing a room, we warmed up to each other and started becoming friends. I had noticed that Jenny did not like me, so the change was pleasant. We never talked about Sam, and I was glad of that. I found Jenny to be very quiet and shy, and not at all scary. 

I was also friends with a girl down the hall, Morgan*, who was the only girl on the entire floor that Sam still talked to. A little background, Morgan was your stereotypical tough black girl, who was blunt to the point of offense and didn't take crap off of anybody, which I liked about her. After losing her roommate as well, Morgan let Sam move in with her. Shortly after that, Morgan kicked Sam out. I asked Morgan what happened, and finally heard the whole story.

Sam was a little crazy (bipolar, we later found out). She was putting her stuff on Jenny's side of the room, and when Jenny would move it back, she would get upset. She would also borrow Jenny's things without asking. Sam began to believe that Jenny hated her and was going to kill her (yes, literally) if she did not move out. Jenny had never threatened her, only politely confronted her and tried to set some ground rules, perhaps getting a little hostile when Sam would not cooperate, but she believed this. In this belief, Sam was found hiding under the stair case one night (they lived on the third floor) with a fake sword (but it was still heavy), threatening to club Jenny with it if she came down the stairs. Sam was convinced that Jenny was going to try and attack her. Sam also hid in the community bathroom with a pen, and said she was going to stab Jenny if she came in there after her. Jenny was blissfully unaware of all this, but fortunately, some other girls on the floor were looking out for her, and filled her in after Sam moved out (in my oppinion, she should have known immediately so she could protect herself).

The week after these occurences was when I moved in. I had introduced myself as a friend of Sam's. Jenny was terrified of ME, worried that I had the crazy as well. Halfway through our term of living together, after becoming friends, I had finally found out the whole story. After hearing all of this from Morgan, I talked to Jenny, asking why she hadn't told me. ""You didn't seem open to the story,"" she said. ""You had said you were friends with Sam, and I was scared of you. I was so relieved to find out that you were normal. I had thought Sam and I were friends up until the day she moved out, then I found out about all the stuff she had been saying about me. She was the only person I knew here.""

To top it all off, that was Jenny's first semester at a new university. I couldn't believe that Sam was the only person she really knew (or thought she knew). I felt terrible.

I told Jenny how sorry I was that I had been so cold to her at first. I had no idea what she had been through, and I explained my side as well, as meager as it was. Fortunately, we stayed friends after I moved out (I am going to be a bridesmaid at her wedding this coming year). Jenny is to this day the best roommate I have ever had. I have no idea what became of Sam, but I heard that she had dropped out of college and spent some time in counseling. I hope she got some help.

"c7ordyg","EDIT : sorry for block of text - renting and how people act about it is a pet peeve of mine

Rented quite a few times, either from individuals and from companies, and there is no special norm with landlords: some are very honest while others will try to dime you all the way. However, this isn't the most important lesson here - what a renter must remember is to always do his / her part of the work (and not only on the final cleaning):

- when entering (first day, when you get the key, if possible), create an extensive list of everything that is available (drier, washing machine, AC, etc); also document all problems (blemishes, things that don't work) and make photos of everything (electronics, walls, carpet) insisting on parts that are not up to par; best way would be to do this with the owner and you both should sign it and have a (xeroxed / carbon) copy 

- if the owner was not present when you redacted this document send this info to the owner in a traceable way - by registered post (with signature - best way), in person (asking for a signature on a special document you prepared certifying that you left the information) or by email (but make sure you use an official address and that you get a confirmation) - keep everything friendly but firm - you are just creating something that will serve you both

- if you discover other things that are wrong (or problems appear) do the same thing - document them, send the info, ask for repairs or do them yourself while keeping the receipts if the owner refuses (get everything in writing, at least the request to repair); don't wait for the last day to fix anything you broke - you'll do a half assed job and then be annoyed when your money is used to pay a professional to fix it !

- when leaving, do your job - clean the apartment / house ! No points for you if you don't do it correctly - everything should at least be as good as when you entered (meaning that if there was something dirty when you entered you should not feel entitled to leave some garbage out of spite). Remember somethings are yours to fix too (depends on the country/state) : clean the fireplace, replace gaskets, be wary of water damage from open windows and so on.

- last day, make a pass with the owner, documenting the same way as you did in the beginning; you especially need to have a paragraph (either in an official document, if your state / country has such a thing, or in your own document) detailing what the owner is not satisfied with (_do_ write and detail that this should be a comprehensive list); if you have any observations (you don't agree with what the owner thinks because of argument X) write it, so your answer is available. Ask the owner to sign the document and sign it yourself; make more photos of everything paying special attention to points where the owner indicated he / she wasn't happy and send them a copy afterwards.

This way you have a clearly documented way to use if your deposit is not returned. You will naturally ask for an itemized list of all the things which had to be corrected after you left and if you do not agree you have everything you need to go to a judge and easily win. If you expect the owner to photograph and document everything and then complain that ""two pictures were missing"" at the trial, sorry, but you also entered in this contract and you should protect your own damn rights !

The problem with most renters I know is that they never get out of their own point of view : you cannot assume anything about what the owner wants - if you do some modifications ask and get approval in writing (I had a friend paint her walls purple because ""it looked better"" and then be amazed when the owner charged her to repaint white). Also, understand that renting is a contract as any other so if you want everything to work perfectly besides doing your normal part (cleaning, maintaining) you should also enforce the contract (ask for repairs, do them if it is your duty and keep a list of things you did).

For me these steps have worked - while it is true that I do spend more time than some of my friends I have never been deducted anything from my deposit and three or four owners have personally thanked me and said they almost never see people pay such attention when cleaning or maintaining an apartment. While I also had a situation where I had to threaten legal action against the owner just showing the documents made him back down and reimburse me entirely.

Halloween this year I didn't have a costume, so I suited up and donned one of those cheap, shitty anonymous masks they sell at Halloween stores everywhere (all black, your entire face is covered, no features, etc. -- they're actually a bit creepy-looking).  

I went to a bar with a friend of mine that I hadn't actually spent time with in a few years, so we weren't really there to pick up girls -- just kind of have some brews, catch up, and watch the madness of Halloween night unfold in downtown South Louisiana. 

I forgot to mention that he was dressed as the wrestler Mankind. Bondage mask and all. We looked...a bit strange, to say the least. Mostly because we weren't dressed as ""slutty x"" or ""pimp y"". 

As we were walking up to the bar to grab some drinks, this incredibly inebriated girl takes a look at both of us and, in her most ""intelligent"" voice, states that neither of us could ever get laid wearing the masks we were wearing. 

While my friend just gave her a good, solid ""fuck you bitch"", I took the mask off, smiled, and said ""challenge accepted"" before re-donning it. 

Drunk me was a social dynamo that night. I was suave, I was friendly, but more than anything I was confident. Now, that may not seem like much, but I am NEVER a confident person unless I'm at work where I'm paid to be. I'm incredibly introverted and really shy and pretty meek, honestly. But, something about that girl just...ignited every terrible year at high school and middle school that I ever had.

"c7h6wog","It depends on your definition of ""security"". 

There are no guarantees.  Realistically any place can and will fire anyone they want to at any time.  However there are things that can be done to make yourself more difficult to fire. 

Yes, I can be fired on the whim of my employer. It has been like that in every publicly traded company that I have worked for in multiple US states.  

The real purpose of my job is to support my lifestyle.  That means I have an income requirement, a not-wanting-to-kill-myself requirement, a location requirement, and a growth requirement. All of these requirements are variable and work off of one another.  The way I make sure my job continues to fulfil this purpose is to work is to make myself useful to my employer. 

I have no illusions of loyalty coming from my employer, and my employer has no illusions of loyalty from me. When it comes up during interviews, I explain it in an interview friendly, but honest way: I leave when it's no longer beneficial for me to work at a place. 

The ability to get fired at a moment's notice is nothing new.  Layoffs, downsizing, etc, has been happening in its current state since the late 70s in white collar jobs. 

My point here is that we have ALWAYS been disposable. The world just moves faster now.  

All security is relative. You can work to make yourself harder to fire. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. That's why professionals have developed tools to deal with it when fortune does not smile in their direction. Networking, constant learning, and politics. If the era ever existed where you could just go to your job, do your job and go home and not think about it, we're not in it. But I doubt our parents were in that era, either.

"c7e5bk5","I have two things, some personal experience and some advice.  Please read both before you draw a conclusion.  Sorry about the length, I'll put a TLDR at the bottom but I think this may be helpful to you.

**First the personal experience.**  I am keeping this extremely anonymous, for what should be obvious reasons.

A close friend of mine, let's call this person Sam.  Sam has had depression for most of Sam's adult life.  Despite the depression, Sam is full of life and energy and vitality.  But much like yourself, Sam would get into a depressive funk for hours, and had terrible self-esteem.  The depression is understandable, Sam's had a rough life.  But Sam is and always was a good and honorable person, who highly values friendship and the friends who stick by when times get tough.  And if you needed a friend, Sam'd ALWAYS be the first one there.  Sam has tried several drugs for depression, one of which was Wellbutrin.

When Sam started Wellbutrin, it created a slow but very noticeable change.  The drug worked, the depression and sadness drained away and muted into just 'meh that sucks, let's get on with life' and they became far more functional.  But the good emotions drained away and muted too.  Sam's energy and vitality drained away into 'meh'.  That included positive emotions like love, friendship, loyalty, and especially the high value Sam used to put on true friendship.  That just turned into 'meh' as well.

Sam on Wellbutrin became, well, not a good person.  Instead of being highly valued, true close friends became 'occasionally useful but often annoying when they call'.  After a while of this, myself and Sam's best friend of several years (probably the two people in the world closest to Sam) tried to sit Sam down and talk about how Sam was treating the friends Sam had previously claimed to care about.  Sam's response (more or less directly quoted):  'well if you don't like who I'm becoming then maybe you shouldn't be my friend anymore'.  No sadness, no emotion (at all), no realization that they are willing to end several multi-year close friendships in 30 seconds with no regret whatsoever.  Sam on Wellbutrin really didn't give a shit about anything or anybody that didn't directly affect them.

Fortunately due to other completely unrelated circumstances, Sam ended up stopping Wellbutrin and was back to normal within a few weeks.  When told about the confrontation Sam was beyond horrified, aghast at even being capable of treating a close friend with so little concern.  But on Wellbutrin, it never even occurred to Sam how cold it was, it was just 'those annoying people who keep calling me to ask how I'm doing are now are nagging about my drugs'.  Needless to say Sam hasn't been on Wellbutrin since.

It's important to note that drugs affect people differently.  The extremely negative effect it had on Sam may be a unique case.  I typed this out not to say you're turning fake, but just to make you consider the possibility that Wellbutrin may affect your perception of self as well as your outgoing personality.  

**TL;DR of experience part:  I had a long close friendship with a person who then started taking Wellbutrin, on the drug my friend didn't give a shit about anybody.  Wellbutrin'd Sam was outgoing and happy and friendly but NO emotions, good OR bad, had any weighting.  When confronted, Sam was willing to casually dismiss several close multi-year friendships without a second thought or the slightest bit of sadness or remorse.  Now psych drugs affect different people differently, your experience may vary.  Just consider the possibility that being on Wellbutrin is affecting your own perception of yourself as well as your own behavior.**

**The Advice:**  Only you can decide who you are and who you want to be.  The problem with psych drugs is they can change what 'you' are.  I think you should carefully and dispassionately look back on your actions while on Wellbutrin, and compare them to your actions before you started the drug.  More importantly, compare them to the actions you WANTED to take before you started the drug.  **You need to decide which 'you' is closer to the 'you' that YOU (at the core) want to be.  You won't be on Wellbutrin forever, so decide if the person it's turning you into is the person you wanted to become.**  You might want to sit down with the 'old friends' and get more detail.  Explain to them what's going on and ask for specific behavior examples.  It may be they're just not used to a not-depressed you, or are jealous you're leaving.  Or they may have a point.  Unfortunately, that part is up to you to figure out.",1355126211,"wellbutrin'd sam was outgoing and happy and friendly but no emotions, good or bad, had any weighting.","happy and friendly","friendly",NA,FALSE,"happy and friendly","happy",NA,NA,0

Neither of which fall into areas which are representative of those crime statistics... How many would walk down the street in a predominantly black neighbourhood in Washington?

&gt;The overall homicide rate in Laos is about the same as that in the US overall

As an Australian this is suprisingly high!

I was not talking to reality so much as *perception*. Things are much more complex in how a person perceives threat than simple bulk statistics. For one, even though the USA is relatively dangerous it has a perception of not being a corrupt place, and has a rule of law and an overall image of 'freedom'. Laos doesn't exactly instill a sense that you would get due process if you got stuck in a bad situation - even if they are few and far between.

Yes, I get it, you travelled through Laos and found it safe and friendly. I too travelled through Laos and found it safe and friendly.

"c7dtz5u","It took about three dates and a few talks but we finally made it work.

For a little backstory... we work together. I knew her for about 6 months before asking her out.  I always wanted to keep an arms-length relationship with co-workers so I never really viewed her as more than just a really cool and friendly co-worker. Eventually something clicked and I realized I really liked her, so after about a week of mulling it over I decided to make a move.

I asked her out on the first date and she said yes, but it seemed to be more of a feeling-out period.  We just hugged and said good night.  I asked her out again on a second date and about half-way during that date I told her I was interested in her.  She said she needed time and space to think. I pulled what I still think was a pretty suave move and told her I'd ""give her something to think about"" as I kissed her on the lips.  She was tense but didn't pull away.  I approached her about it a week later to see if she had found some clarity, and she said she really liked me but expressed some concerns about us dating for a number of reasons.  I just held her close and assured her that if we both really liked each other we should try to make it work.  I asked her out again shortly thereafter and while she pulled away the first time I went to kiss her on this date, we eventually did lock lips by the end of the night.

I don't really know how she felt about me before I asked her out so I don't know if I had it pretty much sealed up from the get-go.  If I had to give you any advice I'd say you should be friendly but assertive when it comes to making your intentions clear (to dodge that friendzone) and to be persistent but patient when it comes to approaching her.  Had she turned me down for a date or clearly looked me in the eyes and said ""Sorry, not interested"", I would have let it go.

"c7bcd9a","The trick is not to ask anyone. Seriously. You still hear all the same old whining in the game, which honestly cracks me up because they are sitting there playing and paying a game that they apparently hate. 

In short and in my opinion: 

Pros: 

* Levelling seems a lot less grindy.
* Pandas are really cool. 
* Monks are super fun.
* most of the class changes are for the better (and talents now feel like fun choices instead of min max stuff for the most part).
* the new areas are very very pretty.
* stat consolidation makes gearing simpler again (with room for the ultra refining)
* the raids require thought and coordination (in anything above LFR)
* Lots of really fun quests and breadcrumbs to other areas, questing in general made more friendly and actually enjoyable for the most part. 
* crafting is a lot simpler and makes reasonably useful items for when you start levelling in pandaria.
* loot rolling in lfr raids is FAR better now. All rolls are secret and automatic. If a boss has something you can use, you have a chance to just win it. Of course everyone thinks the system is worse now because they don't win anything because they don't understand probability. 
* a new currency called Elder charms. Basically do daily quests, get lesser charms, once a week you can convert 90 of them into 3 elder charms. When you fight a raid boss or one of the outdoor bosses, after your loot has autorolled, you have a chance to use an elder charm to roll a 2nd time. You can roll again even if you have already won something. I have won two things by this extra roll so don't listen when people tell you it's a waste (I've been told it's a 15% to get loot, you get gold otherwise). You get three a week, use one on a boss that has a great upgrade for you. 
* justice points (new in last patch) can now be used to upgrade your blue end game items by 8 ilvls, which puts them onyl very slightly under the ilvl of LFR epics. This is a great use of justice points as the justice point gear is underwhelming. You can do the same with valor points to upgrade epic gear but you'll most likely be saving those for the gear that you buy with it. 
* making a farm for cooking ingredients was surprisingly rewarding. 

Cons:

* Heroic dungeons are not hard at all (this is a con for me, I liked the challenge of early heroics in cataclysm)
* LFR raid is hilariously devoid of all but the most basic mechanics (which I guess is necessary considering you have to assume the group can't communicate with each other).
* Rep grinds are back, BUT not for anything essential like necessary shoulder enchants. You can get gear by other means if you'd like, it's your time to spend.
* It's still an mmo, which means doing things in order to get gear in order do do the things slightly better to get better gear.
* There is no real need to actively group with anyone unless you are raiding or heroic raiding, and if that's the case you will almost certainly have a guild anyway. Other than that it's a lonely experience unless you actively play with people you know.


People complain about it being casual friendly, but these are the same people that don't play anything harder than LFR, so they have no idea what they are talking about. Anyone actually doing heroic mode raids would never complain about the game being casual friendly, as their accomplishments and rewards far outstrip those people who don't put as much effort in to the game.

Have many copies of a professional headshot and resume and bring them with you on every audition. Make up business cards. Be human when talking to people, especially casting directors, but also remember that as an actor you're a business. Your product is yourself. So sell yourself well but don't be pushy.

"c78ahsi","First off, I am not a doctor or any such professional. Maybe you have some social disorder (besides a very low self esteem) or low level autism like Aspergers? Either way you should see a psychiatrist.

Don't dwell too much on how kids treated you. Always remember that their brains are still developing so things like empathy have not set in yet properly, also social pressure might let a kid do dickish things for cheap laughs or self boosting. Disregard the stuff kids did to you growing up, their stupidity was their problem. Always remember that other people are 99% of the time thinking about their own direction, own stresses/insecurities and own problems. Also remember that you might compare your behind the scenes footage with their highlight reel.

This might be bad advice but (so run it by your psychiatrist): Get angry. Not as in being angry to be an asshole or to be even more negative in society. Stay polite and friendly but allow things to piss you off. This *might* drive you to be assertive. If the chippy ran out of sausage, be pissed and walk to another one. If a store regularly run out of something you like, boycott them for a while and go to a store further on. The extra energy exerted will give your actions purpose. While going to another store keep thinking that you are teaching them a lesson. This might give you a sense of empowerment. This will also give you an air/vibe of ""I am NOT a doormat"". I think that you shouldn't do this for too long because it might set in as a bad habit.

Lastly. Don't worry about the psychiatrist. When I saw a psychologist years ago (I had a lot of stress with a depression under current), I was also very freaked out about the thought of sharing intimate thoughts with a stranger. But I convinced myself with the following. A doctor can't fix your knee, if you don't tell him your knee hurts. Same thing with psychiatrist/psychologist. You are there to fix things, so say what you think is broken. Besides they are your bitch, they are paid well to spend time listening to you (and helping you), you are not wasting their time, they are earning yours. They are professionally trained mature adults to the point of being invisible with their emotions.

According to Evra's testimony, Suárez said in Spanish that he had earlier kicked Evra ""because you are black"", said ""I don't speak to blacks"" and used the word ""negro"" five times in total as they argued. Suárez had claimed that he used the word 'negro' only once to address Evra and this was intended to be conciliatory and friendly, but the FA rejected this claim as being ""unsustainable and simply incredible given that the players were engaged in an acrimonious argument."" As the conversation between Suárez and Evra took place in Spanish, linguistic experts were called in to help the panel with the meaning of the phrases. The panel concluded that ""Suárez's use of the term [negro] was not intended as an attempt at conciliation or to establish rapport; neither was it meant in a conciliatory and friendly way."" Suárez was also warned that two similar offences in the future could lead to ""a permanent suspension"".[122]

"c707xsk","&gt; Yes, the usual defence is that atheists don't gather in communities.

That's not what I said at all. You either need to work on your reading comprehension or, more likely, try to consider the actual points being raised instead of erecting ridiculous strawman arguments. It gets tiresome.

&gt; Of course, it's utterly laughable since googling ""atheist forum"" alone produces eleven million results.

Googling ""Flat Earth forum"" produces 14 million; ""Christian forum"" produces nearly 90 million and ""Religious forum"" results in 156 million. If we go on the search results alone, that means there are over 14 times as many religious communities online as there are atheist communities. I don't know what percentage of the English speaking online world is atheist and which percentage is Christian, or religious, but Christians do seem to be largely under-represented on the Internet, while atheists seem to be over-represented. Perhaps that's partly down to my own information bubble, perhaps it's more likely that atheists go online (I suspect a bit of both based on recent demographics). It's simply not clear whether atheist communities are common compared to religious communities from a simple Google search. As usual, the issue is far more complex than you like to pretend it is. The other problem with just doing blind searches and counting the results, as I hopefully demonstrated by showing that there are more results for ""Flat Earth forum"" than there are for ""atheist forum"" is that the relevancy of the results tails off the further down the list you go. I didn't even have to go through that many pages before I started finding *Christian* forums in the search results for ""atheist forum"". I found lots of threads on Christian forums about atheism! Not to mention many that were nothing to do with either atheism, or were forums.

&gt; So we can dismiss that ~~lie~~ strawman.

&gt; So where are the ones filled with tolerant, reasonable atheists who are accepting of religious people?

I addressed your question in my response above. You'd have to ask a person who actively frequents atheist forums. Most atheists do not, for the reasons I already explained, which is partly why your challenge is invalid to begin with - simply by choosing online atheist forums, you're already selecting a specific kinds of atheist out of the set, meaning that any data you gather applies only to that particular subset. You would also have to actually define what you mean by ""*filled with tolerant, reasonable atheists*"". You're not likely to find *any* forum filled completely by people who are 100% tolerant, reasonable, accepting, friendly etc., here included. You would need to define some kind of threshold and agree on a measurement. Are all of the Christians on [/r/Christianity](/r/Christianity) tolerant, respectful and accepting? Definitely not, and you're one of the ones who is the least respectful! Consider, for example, the reverse challenge. You might point to /r/Christianity as a good example of a Christian forum that is tolerant, respectful and friendly. But whether this forum is generally tolerant, respectful and accepting depends who you ask and what kinds of threads they're interested in. Certain threads attract different kinds of people. It can even depend on the time of day as people in different time-zones can exhibit different behavior. Most of the very conservative Christians are on during timezones in which the US is awake, for example. During timezones in which Europeans are awake, I imagine the forum is probably more liberal.

&gt; What's noticeable is that like almost every atheist before you, instead of accepting the challenge and providing evidence that most atheists are tolerant and pleasant, you instead work to convince yourself that you don't have to accept the challenge.

Instead of addressing the actual points or considering even the possibility that just maybe the issue isn't as black and white and simplistic as you're making it out to be, you instead work to erect childish strawman arguments to attack so that you can feel superior. This is why it's so difficult to have any kind of reasonable discussion with you. I thought we were actually making progress with the above conversation, until you reverted back to the petty ad hominems and weak strawmen. I'm almost disappointed.

&gt; The reason you want to avoid the question is because like everyone else, you already know the answer.

At least, that's what you keep trying very hard to convince yourself every time. I, and several others apparently, have noticed an ongoing theme in your responses, which is that you desperately try to convince yourself that atheists are responsible for many of the wrongs in the world and against yourself and that we're generally morally inferior. I've seen several reasonable discussions with you turn into vitriolic, ignorant rants based on black and white thinking, confirmation bias and outright refusal to consider anything other than what you wish were true. It's almost like, when it comes to discussing atheism, the reasonable part of your brain just switches off, only to be replaced by this unreasonable, emotionally driven, arrogant, rude, asshole. Perhaps that makes it easier for you to cling to your beliefs; maybe deep down you know they're not reasonable, and so you work hard to convince yourself that, even if they might not be completely true, at least they make you a better person?

If you actually take a moment to objectively consider the facts, you'd find that study after study after study has proved beyond any shadow of a doubt that generally, atheists and religious people are equally moral people. I believe I've already given you plenty of studies and statistics showing this in the past, which were conveniently ignored. The main difference is actually that religious people generally want to *appear* more moral to their peers than atheists do.",1352737616,"you might point to /r/christianity as a good example of a christian forum that is tolerant, respectful and friendly.","respectful and friendly","friendly",NA,FALSE,"respectful and friendly","respectful",NA,NA,0

"c6wzmkp","Well, first off, Ozai's show of force fails anyhow. Aang kept him busy almost all the way through the comet, and Sokka/Toph/Suki took care of the rest of his holocaust zeppelins. So they never make it any farther than that particular delta where the fight took place.

Additionally, even with Aang defeated (and thus killed), Ozai is now stranded on that particular patch of Earth Kingdom territory, with only whichever survivors of the airships wash ashore nearby. So Ozai has, maybe, 100 soldiers tops, and is in nominally Fire Nation colony territory. Since his show of force fails however, he still has to worry about any earthbender or Earth Kingdom rebels in the area while he tries to make his way to a Fire Nation military installation. 

Meanwhile, Sokka and crew turn their airship and start limping towards either the Fire Nation, or Ba Sing Se, whichever is closer. Ba Sing Se was still liberated by the White Lotus after all, and Zuko and Katara still captured Azula. Zuko claims the title of Fire Lord, and begins to consolidate his power. Whichever functionaries were still in the Imperial City likely acquiesce to him out of fear, and they begin the process of freeing those allies which are being held captive nearby, namely the Kyoshi warriors, as well as Water Tribe and Earth Kingdom soldiers captured during the invasion. When word spreads to the nearby military bases, there will likely be some who decide to cast their lots in with Zuko, and some who stay loyal to Ozai. Fighting breaks out, and Katara will likely be forced to protect Zuko as he recovers until the prisoners are freed and can arm themselves in Zuko's defense.

If Sokka and crew make it to the Imperial City, the news will absolutely devastate Katara, and she will immediately decide to chase after Ozai. With a bit of a talking to, she will instead see the importance of keeping Zuko on the throne; something Aang died to make happen. If Sokka instead goes to Ba Sing Se, Katara will simply be left worrying for days on end about not hearing from Aang, until military intelligence starts getting rumors of the Avatar's demise. Meanwhile, Sokka and company give the bad news to the White Lotus.

For the rest of this speculation, I will assume that Sokka went to Ba Sing Se, as the divergence of events is simply too great to address in one post.

Iroh, upon receiving word of Aang's death, will put on his general's cap and realize the situation as I described it above: Ozai is stranded with a small entourage in nominally friendly but contentious territory. He will mobilize several of the high ranking members of the White Lotus, such as Jeong Jeong, Bumi, Paku, and Piandao in order to try and capture Ozai, leaving the rest of the White Lotus to help with securing the city. They now either load into the airship, or set out overland with Bumi and Toph earthbending them to make excellent time.

Katara, hearing the news third-hand from one of Zuko's new soldiers, is crushed. But at this point, the prisoners have been released, and her father is there to comfort her. She insists of seeking revenge, but between Hakoda and Zuko, they manage to convince her that it is not the best plan. She reluctantly agrees to wait a little while longer, but she grieves for Aang, and worries a great deal about what became of her brother.

During all this, Ozai is rounding up his survivors. His glee at victory quickly fades with the reality of the situation, and he knows he has to get moving. With whatever number of men he can gather together, as I said before likely only a hundred or so, he sets off for the nearest Fire Nation military installation.

In the general public view though, there is nothing confirmed. There are rumors that the Avatar killed the Fire Lord, and rumors that the Fire Lord killed the Avatar. Fire Nation scouts are dispatched to the area to ascertain the truth, but Earth Kingdom rebels make their way there to do the same. And if the Fire Lord is still alive, they seek to fix that.

So you have Ozai trying to move overland to a friendly location, likely with Fire Nation scouts looking for him.

Unfortunately, word is also getting around that Zuko has claimed the throne, and all throughout the Fire Nation military there arises the conflicting sentiments between loyalists and reformists; those who will side with Ozai, and those who will side with Zuko. This may manifest as minor defiance to outright rebellion in any given Fire Nation island or military outpost. You also have abolitionist and separatist factions forming; generals who seek to seize the command of the Fire Nation for themselves and destroy the Imperial family, and those who simply no longer wish to serve either Zuko or the here-to-fore absent Ozai. And in this political upheaval among the Fire Nation ranks, Earth Kingdom rebels will increase their efforts.

Ozai will likely make it to a military installation before anyone else finds him, and word will spread that Ozai is still alive. The loyalist faction will get a boost in morale, and this will likely encourage action the brings the political situation to a head. With Ozai confirmed alive, and reformists, abolitionists, or separatists are suddenly entirely reliant on open rebellion to see their wishes come to pass. Many small mutinies and large schisms will occur, and the Fire Nation military will be in disarray.

Now though, Iroh and the White Lotus will be closing in on the military installation. Iroh will know that Ozai was stranded and would need to seek the nearest source of help, and would know to target the closest military installation. With the White Lotus at his back, Iroh and company lay siege to the military base in an effort to capture Ozai.

Katara, her worst fears about Aang 100% confirmed, will fall into a depression and become reckless and destructive, culminating in her stealing away with Appa one night to hunt down Ozai herself.

Zuko will be left in the Imperial city, swamped with political intrigue, when Mai and Ty Lee arrive from the Boiling Rock. With those two by his side, Zuko will turn his full attention to consolidating his support in the Fire Nation.

While the White Lotus lays siege, Ozai and his men will organize to meet them. Without the comet, the standard firebender is no match for any one of the masters outside, but with walls and strategic placement, Ozai will make it a difficult battle indeed. Meanwhile, the tactical powerhouse duo of Piandao and Sokka will hatch a plan to end the siege. When they finally break down the walls though, they discover that Ozai has stolen away, and once more they are in pursuit.

Katara finds the battlefield without much difficulty; even two weeks later it is still smoldering. She scours the scene of the battle, and horrifically finds what she had hoped wasn't there: Aang's body. After being immolated and left in the open for two weeks, it is barely recognizable but for the orange and yellow fabric. Katara weeps for a long time before burying her friend. In absolute, unbridled, calm and calculating rage, she sets out on Appa, determined to find Ozai.

With the White Lotus on his trail, Ozai moves quickly, with only two or three bodyguards at his back. Encounters with travelers are avoided. They make their way to a Fire Nation port, in the hopes of seizing a boat and making for the Fire Nation.

The White Lotus keeps on Ozai's trail. Ozai was never one for wilderness tracking, and is leaving an obvious trail. They close in on him one night...

When the sky bison slams into the ground Ozai is on his feet in an instant, as are his bodyguards. Waves of fire surge forth, but are extinguished in a blanket of steam. Suddenly, his arm twists violently of its own accord, tearing the bone from the socket. His bodyguards collapse is writhing agony before going silent.

Katara steps out of the steam, her fingers poised in front of her face, with tears in her eyes. Without a word, her hands move, and Ozai feels like his organs are tearing themselves apart. They are. He doesn't even know what is going on when he hits the ground.

When the White Lotus enter the clearing, they find Appa sitting sullenly alongside Katara, who is staring blankly into space. Ozai has been killed. Sokka hobbles over to his sister. He doesn't ask what happened. He knows. Katara just looks at him, and begins to cry.",1352162306,"iroh, upon receiving word of aang's death, will put on his general's cap and realize the situation as i described it above: ozai is stranded with a small entourage in nominally friendly but contentious territory.","friendly but contentious","friendly","but",FALSE,"nominally friendly but contentious","contentious","nominally",NA,1
"c6wuzd6","Up until that point, I had basically thought of it the same way. I'll kill a snake without thinking twice about it. Same for pretty much every bug. 

But when I *try* to kill an animal, and they're still alive? That's when the realization sorta hits me that this animal would still be alive if I don't kill it. Especially if I inflict some sort of damage, now I'm just watching it struggle -- even for ants and spiders, the same thing happens (some of their legs twitch and you can tell they're trying to move, but they just can't do it). Hell, for fish it's even worse (for anyone who's had an aquarium). Unless they die instantly, it's gonna take a while, and you have to watch as their function degrades (unless you decide to put them out of their misery by killing them, which still kinda makes you feel bad). 

There's no good answer to it. I had a dog die due to cancer, and there was nothing we could do. We already had multiple surgeries for him, but the cancer kept spreading. So we ended up putting him down on some random day, even though he seemed to be feeling completely fine that day. He was energetic and friendly, but the cancer had spread to his hips (and it was only going to get worse -- after already being pretty 
bad), so we had to put him down. One of the worst days of my life.

Edit: I should mention -- the first surgery was to try to get rid of the tumor in his leg. That didn't work, so the second surgery was to amputate the leg. That seemed to work for about a week, but then he stopped eating entirely, so we took him back to the vet again, and the vet noticed another *larger* tumor in his hip. This was after he'd already had a tumor the size of an avocado in his leg. It's something we would've noticed if we had felt his leg beforehand, but we never expected it. Even just looking at it, you wouldn't notice, because it was under the muscles.

Jump in a group last night on my DK (lvl 88, just dps atm) prot paladin comes to tank Mogushan Palace, first thing he says ""I have never been here before"" so as I have a 90 prot warrior and a 90 prot paladin I and a few of the others give him a rundown on stuff as we go.  In the room before the second boss he just starts running a circuit around the balcony areas round and round because the othe guys asked him to clear both sides, then when nobody is ready he runs straight to the boss alone and gets killed almost instantly.

""if you give me orders I will just do complete opposite""

"c6msaf3","Umm no, I believe I'm constantly revealing that I know more about Christianity than you. You'd need months, perhaps years of unbiased studying of Christianity to become as knowledgeable as I am. I hate Christianity indeed - it's the longest-running terrorist organization and among the greatest sources of evil worldwide. Unlike you, I can substantiate my standpoint, of course.

About this ""500+ years old"" thingie... you really don't know much, do you? Here, let me educate you.

First, this highly fraudulent claim that Christianity has somehow self corrected. No, you ignoramus, Christianity had the power to torture and kill people, to send troops into war, forcibly wrested from it! Swimming pools full of blood had to flow before enlightened societies were able to break free from Christian rule, and this is hardly to Christianity's credit. The currently active Catholic Church law still maintains that the Church has ""the power of the sword"" over ""heretics,"" and only current circumstances hinder it from exercising that power. In other words, what you're saying amounts to praising Charles Manson for not murdering any more people now that he's locked up.

Now let's bring you up to date on what Christianity has been doing these days. For having been largely powered down, Christianity continues to manage an impressive pile of corpses:

* The Holocaust. We can't blame Christianity for WW2, but we can certainly blame it for the anti-semitism that permeated much of Europe for centuries, fuelled by [blood libel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_libel#Papal_pronouncements) and Martin Luther's wicked text [On The Jews And Their Lies](http://www.humanitas-international.org/showcase/chronography/documents/luther-jews.htm). In wiping out the Jews, Hitler was doing the work of the Church, as he affirmed in this speech:

    &gt; “I have been attacked because of my handling of the Jewish question. The Catholic Church considered the Jews pestilent for fifteen hundred years, put them in ghettos, etc., because it recognized the Jews for what they were. In the epoch of liberalism the danger was no longer recognized. I am moving back toward the time in which a fifteen-hundred-year-long tradition was implemented. I do not set race over religion, but I recognize the representatives of this race as pestilent for the state and for the Church, and perhaps I am thereby doing Christianity a great service by pushing them out of schools and public functions.”

* The ethnic cleansings by (Christian Orthodox) Serbs in Yugoslavia between 1991-1995

* [Catholic Church participation in the ethnic genocide in Rwanda, 1994](http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4615171)

* [Catholic war on condoms keeps the most effective means of AIDS prevention out of the hands of those who need it](http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2010/sep/11/bad-science-pope-anti-condom), dooming millions to illness and death.

* [Thousands of people, many of them children, suffered or died because they were given prayer instead of real medical attention](http://whatstheharm.net/religiousfundamentalism.html).

* [Children killed in Africa after being denounced as witches by Christian pastors](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/10/18/african-children-denounce_n_324943.html)

* [Gays killed in Uganda and other places by Christian fundamentalists](http://www.premiercommunity.org.uk/forum/topics/christian-group-behind-attempt)

All this has been going on within the past 100 years, you blind stooge. The fight against contraception alone is an ongoing cause of suffering and death for hundreds of thousands annually worldwide; its chief instigators are the Catholic Church and American Christian fundamentalists.

Let me harsh your buzz on those warm fuzzy feelings you like so much! Let me tell you about the Philippines. This is a relatively small island nation where 93 million friendly but mostly poor people find themselves living in a state strongly in the grip of the Catholic Church. Politicians are in the hands of the Church, and thus it was able to institute a nationwide policy of tight control of contraceptives and practically complete interdiction of abortion. Poor families typically have 6 children, and the nation's economy is completely unable to sustain the rapidly growing population. Denied contraception, Philippine women resort to illegal back-street abortions, and often throw their aborted fetuses on the street in front of Manila's main cathedral. Can you imagine the anger and frustration that drives these poor women? Of the parents of many Philippine families, one member often leaves the country to work abroad to feed the family, as there are no jobs to be had in-country. The men work at menial jobs, the women as prostitutes. This is the result of the Catholic Church's ""family"" policy: poverty, suffering, desperation. And the Philippines are just one example. 

For lack of space, I haven't even started on the [Magdalene laundries](http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2011/jun/08/irealnd-magdalene-laundries-scandal-un) where Catholic churches incarcerated young women for a lifetime of hard labor, and that were shut down as late as 1996; or the [hundreds of thousands of babies stolen from their mothers by the Catholic Church and sold for profit](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2049647/BBC-documentary-exposes-50-year-scandal-baby-trafficking-Catholic-church-Spain.html).

Stop the day-long one on one trips and activities, stop taking advantage of her silence on the boyfriend front to justify your inappropriate advances. Find a girl who is single and date her.

"c6jxl8a","I am physician in the US (in the one of the best health care organizaton in the country - according to Obama and Mitt). Also, I have worked in the private practice and in goverment run system (In Europe). 

My opinions are:

1. There is no health system where all will be happy. System may be very costumer friendly but expensive (like in US), or cheaper but slower and more cumbersome for costumer.

2. Health care will not get cheaper and ther is no way to change this. Reason is that there is more and more costumers and more and more health care products that we sell to the costumer.

3. We allready pay for the uninsured through our taxes and them using the emergency rooms for care (I have never seen late stage syphylis before comming to US becasue patient had no insurance and waited until it was clear he is falling appart, and than went to ER). 

4. I think that everyone should be covered by some form of health care that provides certain level of care. More than that should be left to the market forces.

5. Hardest part is to decide where is the line between what is available for all, and what is left for purchase for those with means to pay.

PS. Of course I can spend hours talking about it and giving bad and good examples but this is the shortest version.

"c6jx63m","It's funny that you ask that. Recently I had a kidney stone block my left ureter. I called the VA and they said ""Just go to the closest ER."" The Dallas VAMC is about an hour's drive, so my wife called 911 and an ambulance took me to Baylor Hospital. They ignored my notification of autonomic dysreflexia when my BP shot way, way, way up. (AD can kill a paraplegic by causing a stroke and it is a condition easily missed by ER doctors.) 

Apart from my experience in the ER, my stay at the hospital was pretty good. The room was excellent, the staff fantastic, knowledgeable and friendly. But there was one thing: They really didn't know how to ""handle"" a T4 paraplegic. The bathroom was ""accessible"" but not really. My wife brought tools and extra equipment to the hospital. On my third day there I got out of bed and helped her ""redesign"" the bathroom. We removed parts from the toilet and bolted on new hand rails. When we were done I finally was able to use the facilities. Ah!

My neighbor developed ALS. He was a Navy vet (like me) and went to the Dallas VAMC for help. His experience was different. While they did eventually work well for him, getting the process started was time consuming. I've heard they've improved how they deal with those with ALS (important as the numbers are increasing), so it's apparent they were not doing that good in this area.

All I can speak of are my experiences. While not everything has been perfect at the VA, overall it's been good to me. I suspect that being service-connected and 100% disabled triggers a different response from the VA. My father is 30% disabled and avoids the VA completely.

"c6hgxb4","Here is a moderate-right, Fidesz-friendly but also critical publication in English: http://hungarianglobe.mandiner.hu/

My 2 cents: look at it this way it is not that people love Fidesz so much, it is that they hate the Left so much because it is an absolutely terrible choice here, for the following reasons: the essence of the Left is to equalize wealth and power. But in Hungary it is typically the Left who had all the power in the Commie era which they transformed into having most of the wealth in the current era. A Left that actually consists of most of the economic and political ruling class is obviously a dishonest, useless party I think this is self-evident. As they are not going to equalize themselves. Another related problem is that even if there would be a honest leftie party, maybe the LMP, then the general problem in Hungary is not that wealth is inequally distributed but plain simply there is not enough. Not enough in Hungarian hands and not in foreign ones, and owned legally, not illegally, at least. There is not enough money, not enough capital, not enough jobs, not enough factories. So even a honest leftie party would be totally out of touch because say for example when they would say they fight for factory worker rights people would say: ""What factory workers? There are no factory workers, there are unemployed former factory workers. This is insane, our first problem is that we need five times as many factory jobs and worry about how nice they are later on!"" There is plain simply not enough of anything to redistribute, so even a honest redistribution-oriented leftie party would be pointless. Wealth was stolen, sold to foreigners, squandered, lost, or managed idiotically and disappeared. So even a honest left would be pointless.

This is why people stick with the Fidesz - there is no alternative.

Basically the Fidesz is the last hope. The country is in such a shitty shape economically, read, so few people working especially so few working in the private sphere and paying taxes, that if they fuck it up, the country will become a complete failed state with everybody young emmigrating and everybody old starving. So essentially the choice is either hoping that despite the 132112 things they did badly the Fideszh will somehow magically save the economy, or it is moving abroad, or killing yourself, there is no fourth choice. This is it,  basically.

This is probably difficult to imagine. I try to explain the economic situation. My family and friends were usually small entrepreneurs in either construction or gastronomy. ALL of them are bankrupt. There is basically no construction going and almost every restaurant is empty from the cheapest to the most expensive. I know exactly one bar that is not losing money, and it is next to a college, and the days it has the most sales is the day when student loan is paid. If you think about it is extremely depressing, both because there is simply no consumption from private money, and because using students loan to get drunk is a powerful symbol of giving up on teh future.",1349346434,"here is a moderate-right, fidesz-friendly but also critical publication in english: http://hungarianglobe.mandiner.hu/  my 2 cents: look at it this way it is not that people love fidesz so much, it is that they hate the left so much because it is an absolutely terrible choice here, for the following reasons: the essence of the left is to equalize wealth and power.","friendly but also","friendly","but",FALSE,"friendly but also critical","critical",NA,"also",1

&gt;I prefer to be judged by my words, character, and actions first, and gender second.

So do I; so do most people. If I may, then: was *I* judged by my words, characters, and actions first, if I was automatically assumed to be a man? If I'm understanding your thought process, if someone just casually calls me a ""he,"" that person clearly isn't focused on my gender, because to be a man is to be non-gendered. In your world, anytime a ""he"" is thrown into question, gender magically appears, loud and uncomfortable and unnecessary and (ugh) *feminine.* And to be a man is to essentially have a blank slate up on an open podium. Right?

&gt; The Internet is largely anonymous

Then why is it that my gender is consistently confused with being male whenever I am writing about something that is not specifically gender-focused? Why am I *never* assumed to be a ""she"" unless I am directly referencing my gender identity in an anecdote or on one of those ""illegitimate"" feminazi forums?

So I'll ask again: What if I'd made that assumption about you? What would you, really, have done? Your honesty would be deeply, deeply appreciated.

"c6brptk","&gt; I tell Indianapolis people it is not the best place to live, and they attempt to disprove me, yet they have never traveled outside of the Midwest, or even lived in a different town.

I've traveled extensively throughout the US. I've also lived in Tokyo, Taipei, Washington DC, Indianapolis, and now Memphis. Of these, Indy continues to be my favorite city to live in. 

Big advantages to Indy include:

* Not too big, not too small. It has almost anything that you'd want at least somewhere in the city--food, art, parks, music, shopping--and it's easy to get anywhere via I-465
* Drivers &amp; roads. No, I'm not kidding. This is a big one for me. Maybe it's because I'm comparing this to Washington DC (hateful, nasty drivers), Chicago (ditto), and Memphis (drivers so dumb and careless it's a miracle they can even operate a vehicle). I grew up in Indy, and I never thought much about the city's roadways and infrastructure. But after seeing how *bad* some of these other cities are, I've learned to really appreciate what Indy has. Not everything is perfect, but the city is both always improving and always trying to do the best with the infrastructure that's there. Compare this to Memphis, where none of the roads work and they will never be fixed because it's ""good enough."" I rarely find myself furious driving from point A to point B anywhere in Indy, and I can usually do it very quickly. This is *not* the case in DC, Chicago, or Memphis.
* Fast and friendly people. Washington DC (and Chicago, Taipei) was not friendly, but it was fast. Memphis is slow **and** unfriendly. Indianapolis is on a completely different playing field with regards to friendliness compared to these other two cities.

It seems to me that your biggest gripe about Indy is that the resources that it has don't fit with your interests (no NHL, MLB, for instance). I can understand that. I have the same issue here in Memphis. I don't care about college basketball and church, so Memphis isn't my cup-of-tea.

Unfortunately, their science seems to also be pretty bad.

It compares this directly to an inflation adjusted stretch of time for nuclear dating back to the end of the second world war, when nuclear was of great military importance, and thus would have been heavily subsidized even without much consideration for residential applications.

There's a handy [PDF of energy subsidy information for 2007, published by the EIA](http://www.eia.gov/oiaf/servicerpt/subsidy2/pdf/execsum.pdf), a statistics division of the US Department of Energy, and it seems to show that while Nuclear was *far* more subsidized, the rate of subsidization per kWh was about 12 times more expensive for solar (page 16/xvi).

"c64f5qu","I have to ask because any job I've ever interviewed for I've been hired for unless I've turned them down because the compensation wasn't high enough.

I have two resumes. One is a PDF featuring ninjas (seriously) and a standard .doc formatted one. Actually 3, the PDF version pasted into a word doc for the shitty sites that make me fill out everything in my damn resume in a twenty step process.

I always send the ninja one first. 

With a quick glance over my past years emails, I've sent it out maybe 50-60 times with roughly 40 replies to it. I keep the standard .doc format one for those who ask for it.

Why don't more people take pride in their resumes? Hell this ninja one has a few grammatical errors and I'm too lazy to update it and it still gets replies like crazy.

So back to my question:

How well do you feel a creative resume works (even for non-creative job seeking people such as myself). For me it seems to work pretty damn well. 

That's the end of my question.

Some advice maybe:

As for nailing the interview and getting the job, I've always showed up in a suit (even when I had some weird Mohawk shit going on) after I got over my obsession with camo shorts and black t-shirts (which I still landed several positions wearing).

Answer the questions honestly. If they ask you if you know X and you don't then tell them you don't but it won't take you long at all to learn it. (This does not apply to physicians).

Be friendly but honest. If you don't like some of their requirements, say so and give a reason why.

Never answer any question with a bullshit response. 

#1: This is why I think I'm always offered the position: I do research. 

If I find a job I'm interested in, I research the company. I learn what I can about their public faces and their products, infrastructure, methods, etc.

If need be, I question them on it during the interview. God help them if I find a problem with their website.

For example, my previous position had their web server in front of a firewall with RDP wide open. I explained brute forcing RDP during the interview and asked them if anyone routinely checked the logs or if they had any monitoring.

Also, think about this: solar panels are cool and environmentally friendly, but an alternative has to be ready at any given moment.

"c61t6gp","I lived in Anacostia for 6 months in 2006 as a Mormon missionary (my post history reveals that I am no longer affiliated with said church, but the experience remains). We lived in an apartment complex between Alabama and Mississippi Ave, if anyone cares to check how legit our living situation was. Bars on the windows, falling asleep to gunshots at night, drug deals in plain sight, etc.

It is...a pretty bad neighborhood. Several spots in particular- Barry Farm, Condon Terrace, Ainger Place, etc. All pretty rough. There were needles and crack bags strewn around everywhere, used condoms on the sidewalk, and Section 8 housing all around. We were often yelled at regarding our race (Caucasian, obviously) and held in contempt for being in the neighborhood. The young kids were cool, and many of the adults would watch out for us, but the teenagers seemed as though they needed to ""prove themselves."" My companion (Mormon terminology) was actually assaulted by some 16-17 year-olds while we walked innocently down the street, and I almost had to throw some punches to get us out of there. I have a collection of spent ammo casings I picked up from our neighborhood, including a 12-gauge shotgun shell found on the same block as Malcom X Elementary School. Coming from middle-America suburbia, it was a big adjustment.

There's a lot of gentrification going on in the area, and there was a nice, new row of townhouses on one of the streets down the hill from our complex. One of the next streets over was gang central, and a policewoman affiliated with the local congregation told us not to walk in that neighborhood because kids on our street supposedly ""had a rumble going"" with the kids on that street. There was a shooting death within sight of our apartment window on the first night I was training a new kid in the area. We heard the shots fired and saw the police taping off the scene.

All of that said, a lot of the people we associated with were very friendly and protective of us, because we were ""Jesus people"". Those same people we saw dealing drugs in broad daylight told us to let them know if anyone was messing with us, and they'd take care of it. We didn't take them up on it, but we typically felt safe. Whether this was foolhardy faith, the supposed immortality of youth, or actual protection is up for debate.

Anyway, the place overall was pretty disheartening. We volunteered to tutor children at an after-school center, and there was one young boy (probably about 5) who I don't think I said a word to me the entire time we were there, despite the extra attention I paid him. Later, we ran into him in front of his apartment in one of the worst neighborhoods I could fathom, and I felt as though I understood why he seemed so damaged within. Seeing children grow up there was consistently heartbreaking. Schools had problems, parents had problems, kids had problems, police had problems; there weren't many ways out, and it seemed to me that drug and alcohol abuse would have seemed like a pretty rational choice to dull the pain had I not known I'd be transferred out in a few months. It was a difficult place to live, and I don't know what I would be if I'd grown up there. It was the kind of six months that changes you for life.

I hear it's getting better, though I don't know if that's actual improvement or just knocking down the projects so people are forced to move into PG, but I have to hold out hope for those kids who seemed so bright and friendly, but eventually turned into the abrasive, jaded teenagers who literally attacked us on multiple occasions.

I know that was long, and maybe more subjective than factual, but I'm a bit drunk and remembering it makes me pretty emotional. I met some great people, and learned a lot of things, but overall I couldn't believe such a place existed inside our own country, and within ten miles of some of the richest neighborhoods you can imagine.

"c61rvbn","**Warning, High school drama ahead. Skip to the next comment if you don't care to hear it**

This still haunts me I do what I can to keep it out of my head, but minds wander.

In high school I had one hell of a hero complex. Always felt like I needed to be somebodies hero and wound up fighting a lot of other peoples battles or being duped into standing for causes I disagreed with.

There was a girl of course, something was just a bit off about her from the day I first met her. She was extremely chill, super friendly, but distant. Sometimes when I talked to her I would get this sense that she was putting up some kind of shell to protect herself.

I'll openly admit right now what I would never say to anyone who knows us in real life. I liked her a lot, she had what I would describe as mystique. My close friend also liked her though, and he said it first. Being always the hero, always looking out for everyone else I stepped back and he never knew.

Of course the problem was still there, this girl who I liked, who became the best friend I'd ever had and my closest confidant had something seriously wrong in her and I just couldn't put my finger on it. The three of us had a hell of an awesome time for about a year, but as we got closer she started to put down her guard and open up.

I won't go into the various 'problems' she had. All were either manufactured in her own mind or things she did to herself quite clearly. I ran myself ragged doing everything I could for her. Staying up till the early hours of the morning every night talking with her to help her get through another night, following her like a puppy dog everywhere she went, and generally making an ass of myself as she manipulated me. My grades slipped, I dropped contact with most of my friends and even some family.

Eventually I started to realize what was happening, at the time I still believed everything she told me so I felt like a terrible person when I told her I needed some time away to rebuild my strength. The long nights and demands she put on me were draining and I couldn't handle it. Her reaction was nearly violent. The next few months were filled with long hours arguing with her, having her tell every person in our school that I had abandoned her and was a terrible friend, and a lot of nights spent hating myself because I believed more than anyone she told that I was a terrible person.

The culmination came long after, I had been getting closer and closer to breaking down as she continued to wear away at my conscious. I started to confide in a girl I had met on myspace, she was the only outlet I could find and seemed happy to lend an ear to someone with a problem to share.

One night the fighting got worse than it had ever been. I was talking to both girls, being comforted and abused at the same time. Aces went down in that fight, hers was better...

I told her that I loved her, that I never wanted to hurt her. Still fully under the delusion that I had done something terrible of course. She didn't respond for a long time, I felt maybe that meant something to her. It was all I had left after all. Meanwhile I was confessing to the comforting girl that I felt the abusive one didn't care about me anymore and things would never be the same.

Over and over again she started to assure me the abusive girl cared for me and that I shouldn't give up. It started to aggravate me, because *how could she possibly know?* I sent her a message just like that. The thought echoed through my mind a few times something kind of starting to snap. How could she know.. I had been so distraught these months that it didn't dawn on me until right at the moment I sent that final message that the name of the person comforting me was a transformation of the name of my best friend.

My greatest realization was that in my darkest times my only source of comfort was just my tormentor finding a new avenue to get at me. I lost 2 friends for good that night. One was person I had been closer to than anyone before, the other never existed except in my mind.

"c5yufrt","Right now at this very moment in time, big studios like Warner Brothers, Universal, 20th Century Fox, and Sony are all actively participating in keeping silver-halide celluloid acetate film stock manufactured by companies like Kodak and Fuji, as well as the polyester film print stock. They do this not to be nice and friendly, but because film still serves a purpose and a few benefits over the digital format at this moment in time.

Right now, however, there is still a window of opportunity for the film format, and it has to do with film's resolution advantage over digital's. Even 35mm film is much higher resolution than any current digital cinema systems on the market. 65mm film is also not matched by any digital cinema systems, simply because it's so large. There are digital still photography cameras capable of shooting at similar resolutions to large-format film, but even then they require incredibly expensive sensors that would not allow for shooting video due to the incredible size of the files each frame would have.

"c5tp0fi","I don't have any personal experience, but I used to read a blog called Whore on Hold (which is sadly not around anymore). She got everything from adult babies to necrophiliacs who wanted her to simulate them killing her over the phone.

One thing I do remember is her company had a CLEAR policy of no requesting anyone under the age of 18. If they did, you were to report them to the receptionist and hang up the call immediately. I think that is a great policy and you should see if your company has that.

I remember she had x amount of different personalities with fake history that she made up. Different names and backgrounds with personalities. One was the domineering one, one the shy one, the kinky one etc. She said that a lot of men called just to talk and would ask personal questions.

 DO NOT give out personal information #1 tip! Make up someone completely different from who you are in every way. I'd recommend characters of different races, genders, sexualities, backgrounds etc. You could make a google doc with names, lists of hobbies, likes and dislikes, background, major, etc. to reference from. She would write that people would get very attached and request her over and over again and try to form a relationship, try to send her presents and try to meet up. She'd come up with friendly but firm reasons like ""Aw well if I did that I'd lose my job and I need this job. Sorry."" kind of stuff.

She also had some back massagers/vibrators on hand to simulate playing with herself, as well as one of those nailpolish remover jars with the sponge which apparently makes a convincing ""playing with yourself"" noise. But she'd basically do homework while moaning and putting the vibrators up to the phone.

I guess be prepared for some kinky stuff. A lot of people can't find partners to explore those kinks with, so they resort to phone sex operators.  Maybe look up some fetishes like adult baby, domination/submission, etc to prepare yourself so you're not shocked by anything! Goodluck!

This is an issue and it makes me extremely grumpy. I never had any problems with 1st gen Apple products but that seems to be over now. Fuck me.

I didn’t notice it immediately (I’m one and a half months in now) and my screen seems to need an hour or so to warm up, but after that everything that’s displayed for more than three to five minutes at the same place leaves an ugly ghost image for three to five minutes. Not an issue? Try browsing around with a browser, the address bar (always in the same place) will be left behind as a mark, even visible on colorful backgrounds.

I’m so fucking annoyed. I will not accept Apple replacing only my screen. Their incompetent repairs tend to break more than they fix and repair-breaking a brand new machine is unacceptable. I will not accept my Mac to be held hostage for weeks on end.

I will report how my visit to the Apple Store went. I have an appointment and I will be extremely friendly but exact in what I expect them to do. That kind of quality control is completely unacceptable.

Calling the Dr. might help but the Dr has zero authority to tell the insurance company what to do. 

Calling the insurance company is a good idea and they should help BUT you have to remember that you're asking them how to dispute their decision not to pay. Customer service in this area is typically sub par at best. 

Your insurance coverage is a contract with rules. If you don't follow the rules, they win. The rules may say something about disputes needing to be submitted in writing, with certain supporting documents, by a certain time, or to a specific address.

Think of the guy in the Pixar movie ""The Incredibles,"" who is pissed because customers are getting through the bureaucracy.  It's only funny because it's a little true (a lot if you ask some people).

There should also be a state agency that regulates insurance companies. There are laws governing the way they handle claims and people to whom you can complain if the insurance company isn't following the rules.

"c5quqk1","OP, when I was in highschool I spent a lot of time thinking about what other people thought of me. I modified my behavior continuously, yet for some reason I just could not please everyone. When I was a child I was loud and open and friendly, but by the time I graduated I was essentially a mute from all the behavior modification. 

Your problem stems from fear, as most problems do. You are worried about what other people think of you, and fear is something, when communicated through gestures and subtext, that humans find unappealing. Here's how you fix it; don't care about what other people think. The result will inevitably piss other people off, and it's possible that you may not have many friends, but it will free you up to accomplish your goals. Some people, like myself, simply aren't suited for a large friend base. I have 2 or 3 extremely close friends, and that is all I need. When you learn to care about what YOU want, and what is correct, and stop worrying about what other people want from you, you'll find yourself a much more content person. 

I remember I had a period where I opened up in college, and all my friends dropped away. It bothered me at first, but then I realized that I was bottling up my honesty toward them. If someone doesn't appreciate your honesty, then fuck em. They're wasting your time and your intellect.

"c5nriwe","A) No, people in Sweden are generally good at english. As long as they know that you have the intention of learning the language they don't mind speaking english with you until you can speak swedish.

B) Depends. I can only speak for my workplaces, which is not in IT, but in general swedes are very laid back and social in their workplace. There's a lot of ""fika"" going on but there is also a big emphasis on getting things done in between. What I've noticed compared to a lot of other countries is that swedes tend to have a lot of freedom at work but also a lot of personal responsibility. You're assumed to know what you're supposed to do and just do it. Of course all workplaces are different but in general it's the impression I have.

C) In IT it's fairly good if you're planning on living close to the larger cities. However, the first step into IT here is usually in helpdesk even if you have a degree which can be a bit problematic with your language and all. If you are currently employed as a sysadmin you should be able to get a similar job here, or as an on site technician opposed to a regular helpdesk job. Just make sure to have a letter of recommendation from your current employer, it would help you a lot in the search for a job.

D) In IT it's not uncommon for workplaces to provide you with certificates. If you want another education you can always ask for a leave but you have no legal right to have one at your own will, I think, so it's all at the mercy of  your employer.

I can't answer if swedes get more stressed than others. I don't think so. There are a lof of talk about stress here but in general I just think it's because people are health conscious.

People in Sweden are friendly but not social to strangers. Small talk at the bus stop is mostly out of the question but people are generally helpful and friendly when you ask for directions, change or things along those lines. And most people will be happy for a friendly hello. You tend to get close to co-workers and therefor it wont be a problem for you to socialize with them. It might be hard to break the outer crust of a swede at first but once you get inside it's different. It's just the social part, if you socialize more with someone they tend to let you in more. Just think of swedes as terribly shy, it might explain a lot.

To travel within Europe is fairly cheap. I'm sure it's cheaper if you live in Britain or France or something but it's still cheap enough. I flew to London and back for about 50 euros just a couple of months ago. To Greece and back set me back about 400 euros last year. This year I might go to the Alps, flight back and forth seems to be around 400 euros for that too.

No negative stereotypes about Kiwi's. People wont know what you mean by referring to yourself as a Kiwi, though. Like someone else said, they'll probably confuse you for an Australian.

"c5nptud","Hi!  Really glad you're taking an interest, it's a huge win when we can change someone's mind.

Just remember that we have a lot of different opinions here, there's no MR party line.

1.Feminism is the belief that women are subjugated by patriarchy (men) and likely, always were.  


2. I don't believe it exists. The only people pro rape are rapists, who are criminals and will go to jail if they get caught.  I think the threat of rape is currently being used to control men *and* women.  Women are being taught to fear men and see them all as potential rapists, men are being taught that any expression of their sexuality is threatening and they should keep it under wraps.  Objectification is normal, we all do it and as long as we're able to separate fantasy from reality, everything is fine. Victim blaming is a difficult issue. I think it exists but is sadly actually much more commonly happening to men than women. Also, teaching people to avoid situations where they are likely to be victims isn't victim blaming, it's smart.

3. The first thing we need to change is law. Circumcision should be a crime.  Joint custody no child support should be the default, with room for exceptions.  False rape accusations should be harshly punished.  As far as actual solutions, I'm kind of stuck. I don't live in the country I'm a citizen of, and am not a citizen of the country I live in. There need to be marches, protests, anything public and loud but as a woman, I don't feel comfortable being the initiator of these things.    


4. Men are threatening, scary, dominant and controlling according to most of society. Also stupid in the things that are important to women, and idiots/pedophiles with children.  Basically, big lumbering barely tamed beasts.  My husband is 6'3 and really strong. He's constantly getting ""asked"" (ordered) to help carrying things, the moms at the day care sometimes treat him like an outsider. Which is hilarious to me because he's one of the most gentle people I know, whereas I look cuddly and friendly but can be a right flaming bitch.  


5.  Yes, but you need to call yourselves WRA, not feminists.

6. There are a lot of bigoted feminists who just *refuse* to see that the patriarchy they're talking about hurts men as much as women.  it's the subjugation thing again.  The gender problem isn't one sided.

7. Women have definitely been oppressed because people have been oppressed for all of history.  Women just had their movement long before men did.  I am completely against forcing someone into a gender role they aren't comfortable with.

8. I think people should be left to decide what's best for them and not be afraid to be honest about it. You want to stay home and raise kids exclusively, great. But it's not a right. If you want to do that, you need to find a man who's willing to take on the traditional role of provider.  NO one *owes* you that.  And vice versa.  We need to let people be who they are and look for someone that compliments that.

You should learn from him. If you had that attitude with the sets you opened, they wouldn't have floundered, because as soon as the convo started to die, you would've said something like, ""alright you ladies enjoy yourselves tonight"" or something like that, making it seem like you were in control of the convo and just got bored with them.

Usually, if you pre-game you're gonna get wasted, and I've never heard any pua recommending getting wasted while going out.

"c5l8xkx","Ooooh!  I like it!  You could even throw in a ""judgement of Solomon"" thing where the two Companions were fighting over who owned the sword and the Harbinger at the time broke it and gave half to each, saying that they would have peace when they were able to reforge the sword.  This would act as an inadvertent curse/prophecy because neither could go to Shor's Hall until the sword was reforged, and neither could reconcile with the other before death.

It might be interesting to throw in a little U.S. history (I know it's not lore friendly, but Bethesda puts all kinds of ""our world"" references in the game).  After the Revolutionary War, Thomas Jefferson and John Adams both served in George Washington's cabinet.  They had differing political philosophies (Jefferson was kind of an early Libertarian and Adams was a pro-government Federalist).  When Washington didn't run again, both men ran for president, and it was BRUTAL.  Adams won that election.  Jefferson won the next one.  They hated each other for a long time afterwards.

This continued for decades until, late in life, Abigail Adams (John Adams' wife) started writing Thomas Jefferson.  Eventually, this led to Adams and Jefferson writing each other, explaining themselves, and apologizing.  

Then, on July 4th 1926, Thomas Jefferson died.  Later that SAME DAY, John Adams also died.  His last words were, ""Jefferson survives,"" (even though he was wrong).  I shit you not, they were bitter enemies and died on Independence Day 1826, the 50th anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence.  

So, the two Companions could be based on Jefferson and Adams, except they didn't reconcile.  

There is one thing about your idea I don't think will work.  While I thought it should be the original Companions as well, I don't think it can be.  They didn't have those iron swords back then, right?  I would assume they used the steel weapons like the draugr carry.

"c5ii40x","Hello again.
She sounds open to conversation (as open as she is about everything).

So in your place, I would start (online or offline) by saying that you have been thinking about the idea, and if she is still up to it, since you ""admit"" that it seems quite appealing and even tough you did not think of her in that way since she is a friend, you can imagine quite easily a scenario where you both end up in bed.
Or something similar. The key points being here: bringing up the topic again, asking if the idea still stands, and giving a compliment in a friendly but slightly sexual way. Once a lady offers sex, she likes to know she is hot to you.

And based on totally personal experience: I slept with some guys who were virgins at that moment. Yes, it is awkward first time, humor was essential (in a sexy why-don't-you-let-me-take-care-of-that-hihi-way), but what was hot about it is that I knew the guy will always remember it, and that after the first awkward time I will want to make sure he ""leaves"" my bed with some basic skills (insert evil laugh). 
This girl sounds open to stuff so she might have a similar frame of mind. And if she does not have, you can easily inspire her for some repeats, since you will not have to deal with ""will we sleep together?"" - only with ""wow um wow I have three more condoms, wink wink"".

Oh yes, bring at least 3 condoms. Depending on the awkward level, first one or two can easily end up unused, ditched on the floor, without their destiny fulfilled. Three is minimum. Try not to spill them out of your pocket at once, but be prepared. If she is smart she will have her own stash for the occasion, too.

Or one condom can last for an hour. Been there, seen that. Nerves can lead to really short or really long sex.

If you look at this paper 

http://www.commentarymagazine.com/article/dictatorships-double-standards/

It argues that given a choice between the two an authoritarian regime is far preferable to a totalitarian one. Firstly authoritarian regimes have lower death tolls, secondly they have a greater chance of evolving into liberal democracies. Both of these have the same root cause - authoritarian regimes try to 

http://www.commentarymagazine.com/article/dictatorships-double-standards/

&gt; Traditional autocrats leave in place existing allocations of wealth, power, status, and other re- sources which in most traditional societies favor an affluent few and maintain masses in poverty. But they worship traditional gods and observe traditional taboos. They do not disturb the habitual rhythms of work and leisure, habitual places of residence, habitual patterns of family and personal relations. Because the miseries of traditional life are familiar, they are bearable to ordinary people who, growing up in the society, learn to cope, as children born to untouchables in India acquire the skills and attitudes necessary for survival in the miserable roles they are destined to fill. Such societies create no refugees. 
&gt;
&gt; Precisely the opposite is true of revolutionary Communist regimes. They create refugees by the million because they claim jurisdiction over the whole life of the society and make demands for change that so violate internalized values and habits that inhabitants flee by the tens of thousands in the remarkable expectation that their attitudes, values, and goals will ""fit"" better in a foreign country than in their native land.

The same is true of Islamist regimes too - the replacement of the Shah by an Islamic Republic lead to a wave of refugees. The new regime quickly demonstrated sufficient ruthlessness to put down any attempt at organised opposition. Unlike the Shah it took over the economy completely. So there is no large middle class which will one day demand political rights. 

Back in the Cold War the US had some pretty dubious authoritarian allies. E.g. Taiwan, South Korea, South Vietnam, Laos etc. Now it is very noticeable that the dubious allies that the US stood by all are now democracies. The ones it abandoned all are now totalitarian regimes.

Now look at Egypt. The Muslim Brotherhood - which makes videos like [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXvIYD30yAY&amp;feature=share) - ended up [getting 37.5% of the vote, and the Salafists who are even worse got another 27.8%](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egyptian_parliamentary_election,_2011–2012).

The odds are that letting this process run to its natural conclusion will be a theocracy, i.e. a totalitarian regime. 

Now according to Kirkpatrick's theory an authoritarian regime is far better. Hence the SCAF are justified in stopping the process. Also the West should definitely not attempt to force the SCAF to liberalize as that would be completely counter productive in the long run.

That doesn't necessarily mean we should be cheering on the crackdown in public - we (HRW, maybe occasionally the US State Department) may even denounce it, merely that behind the scenes military aid should continue and we should take no step that puts real pressure on the regime. Rather in the way that the US quietly produced reports detailing human rights abuses in its authoritarian Cold War allies whilst at the same time arming them to the teeth and talking them up as 'forces for stability in one of the more troubled areas in the world'

Couldn't have put it better myself President Carter. Wait, what? I thought you were supposed to be following a principled human rights based foreign policy, not the sort of Machiavellian realism nasty reactionaries like Jean and I favour.

Maybe Obama can take a leaf from noted Arab human rights activist Jimmy Carter's book and make a similar toast to whoever the SCAF selects as President.

Then again a better policy is to denounce friendly but authoritarian regimes in public, but support them in private. I.e. the exact opposite of what Carter did. As this article notes

http://diplomatdc.wordpress.com/2011/01/05/shah/

&gt; Despite the toast, Carter tied the Shah’s request for sophisticated weaponry to improved human rights and political freedoms. The President urged the Shah to release all political prisoners including known terrorists, and to put an end to military tribunals. The newly released terrorists would be tried under civil jurisdiction and the Islamic fundamentalists used the trials for propaganda and agitation. The Shah told Carter many of the prisoners were communists not fundamentalists.
&gt;
&gt; Several of the prisoners in 1979 became leaders of the new government led by Ayatollah Khomeini. According to PBS, “Carter seemed to have a hard time deciding whether to heed the advice of his aggressive national security advisor, Zbigniew Brzezinski, who wanted to encourage the Shah to brutally suppress the revolution, or that of his more cautious State Department, which suggested Carter reach out to opposition elements in order to smooth the transition to a new government.”
&gt;
&gt; Following the seizure of the U.S. Embassy in Tehran, Brzezinski had CIA Director Stansfield Turner funnel all intelligence on Iran directly to the White House Situation Room. There were allegations Carter was excluding the Defense Department from this information, but we now know that White House itself was not well informed. The CIA was the focus of liberal scrutiny in the 1970s and their clandestine and covert operations were greatly scaled back.
 The top two-thirds of the CIA Clandestine Services were eliminated or replaced, and their successors were not skilled at recruiting and running espionage networks. The late 1970s was an era of intelligence incompetence. Carter at first did not want the Shah to come to the United States but eventually allowed him to have a visa for medical treatment. However, at the same time his Chief of Staff, Hamilton Jordan, was negotiating with the Islamic Republic to trade the Shah for the U.S. hostages. Jordan was in Las Vegas and speaking on an unsecured telephone line. His conversation was intercepted by General Noriega in Panama who alerted the Shah. The Shah instead went to Contadora in Panama as a safe haven.

I'd say let the sheep at the State Department bleat about human rights in public and let the wolves at the CIA have free rein behind the scenes.

Look at El Salvador. Official US policy was best summed up by this 

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/José_Napoleón_Duarte#President

&gt; On March 25, 1984, in the 1984 presidential elections, Duarte (running as the PDC candidate) came in first with 43.4% of the vote. In the second round, on May 6, he won with 53.6% of the vote against the Nationalist Republican Alliance (ARENA) candidate, Roberto D'Aubuisson. The elections were marred by violence between the FMLN and Salvadoran military at and near the polling stations. Since D'Aubuisson and the ARENA party were widely alleged to have close links with death squads, the Central Intelligence Agency used approximately US$2 million to support the democratic election and to prevent violence at the voting polls. The election was nevertheless considered only the second truly free and fair presidential election in El Salvador's history, as well as the first in over half a century.

No doubt the US had turned a blind eye to collusion between the US backed military in the past and death squads, but official US policy was to back PDC over the death squad linked ARENA party.",1339742059,"then again a better policy is to denounce friendly but authoritarian regimes in public, but support them in private.","friendly but authoritarian","friendly","but",FALSE,"friendly but authoritarian","authoritarian",NA,NA,1
"c50toy0","OK, here goes.   And I'm sure I'll only get to about 10% of what's important.

You are a criminal defense lawyer.  You are not a social worker.  You are not a teacher.  You are not a life coach.  Don't act like those.  You CANNOT get emotionally involved in your cases.  That's death.  Because it's not your life.   You didn't arrest the person, etc.  Stick to your defined role.

You cannot live your client's lives for them.  For the most part they're adults who have made bad choices.  I work in NYC, and I don't want to hear the institutional racism bullshit for why my client committed armed robbery.  Yes, there's racism in a lot of petty drug arrests, stop and frisk, etc.  But those aren't the hard cases.

Commiting a crime is a a choice he made.  That's OK, because it wasn't my choice.  I just have to clean up his crap.  I will refer to social workers, etc., but I'm his lawyer.  I need to act like it.  I don't mean be standoffish or an ass, but I mean be friendly but professional.  The moment you start commiserating with him about his fucked up family life, you're sucked in and it's over.  You may very well feel that way, and that's fine, but the cold reality is that it's not you're life and you're not responsible for him sitting in front of you.  If he's an adult, he's responsible for his own life.  And that's something a lot of our clients can't grasp.

Don't take the job home.  The moment you walk out of the office, you have to make a conscious, voluntary decision to focus on your life and what you want to do, and not on the 17 year old kid who shot his buddy and is in jail on $100,000 bail.  Because when you bring that home, you're just traded your life for his.  It took me about 2 years before I was really able to leave things at the office.  But again, it's a conscious effort.  Obviously, if you're on trial or something, that consumes your life.

Pick your battles.  There are zillions of awful decisions by judges, lying ADAs, deceitful clients, and general malfeasance.  You have to let 90% of it go.  Why?  Because doing something about it won't get that judge's decision changed.  Save your efforts for the issues that both matter and you have a chance of prevailing on.  I've seen some awful decisions, and the first question is ""who is the judge hearing motions today?""  That colors my decision on what to do.  And regardless of the motion judge, if it's a henious decision but I know I will lose the fight, I don't fight.  I don't have the time or the energy.  You'll learn that not everything is as big an injustice as it first seems.

All you have in that courthouse is your reputation.  A huge mistake is that people think it's a popularity contest.  I'm not there to be liked.  I don't really care if people dislike me.  But I am there to be respected.  And the only way to do that is to treat everybody nicely, be forthcoming, be on time and prepared, and stand up for yourself.  That last one is big.  I see many lawyers roll over under heavy arguments from the judge or DA.  That does not get anybody respect.  It ultimately invites derision.  Rightly or wrongly, you have your position for a reason.  Protect it, and make sure they know why you're doing what you're doing.

Keep a good calendar so you're not all over the place.

OK, at 11:43 pm, those are the biggies.  Maybe more to follow.  Feel free to comment or ask questions.

EDIT:  You're not there to save the world or change the system.  You're there for your client, which will have to be noble enough.

	My name is Buck Aldrin.  No relation to the moon-man, everybody thinks so.  Buck is my nickname.  I was given it when I was in boot camp back in ’67.  My real name is…not what I need to focus on.  I’m lost.  Been lost for forty years, or for ten, or for the last six hours depending on how you view it.  I’m in the forest and I’m trying to find my way back.  I’m scared because I’m not sure I’ll find my way back.  I’ve been out a long time and my real name is Archie.  Now I’m a little less scared because if I can remember my name and if I can remember to keep heading West and I can remember to keep checking my surroundings for Charlie I can find my way back home.
	I’m shocked.  I didn’t expect to be here and now I’m here and now there are strange sounds and sights around me and I know what to do but I’m still having trouble doing it but I grab my rifle and I duck low and I take aim and I listen as the gunshots come from the North and I turn and it’s 2012 and I’m a lot older and there are no gunshots.  I’m sorry; my mind wanders from time to time, and I’m lost.  My name is Buck, or at least that’s what people call me.  I steel my resolve in 1970 and in 2012 and I take assessment of where I am and who I am (my name is Archie) and I move on.

I’m scared in 1984 because I did the unthinkable and I’m scared in 2005 because I’m alone in the doctor’s office and I was hoping I was just tired but apparently I’m going to lose my mind and in 2012 I can feel that I did lose my mind because I’m alone in the forest and now I’m in 1970 and there are bullets flying but I’m safe because my buddy Ted is next to me until a crimson splash on his neck tells me that I’m alone.
	I’m alone.
	I’m alone and I’m confused because Ted was next to me and now he’s bleeding out and the Gooks did this but we’re friendly now because it was even a nice Vietnamese man who was leading our group into the woods but now I’m not with the group because I’m lost, but I’m not lost as long as I can remember that my name is Buck.  No, my name is Archie and Buck is my nickname.  And apparently I have a dog but that scares me because as much as I remember now that I love him, I only just remembered he was with me and I don’t want to lose him too.

Exercise helps me to keep a hold of myself but now I’m alone in the woods and I’m not quite sure where I am but at least Poe is with me and I’m seeing a therapist now.  I’m seeing a therapist so I don’t lose my mind, and I’m seeing a therapist in 1984 so I don’t get another flashback and hit the woman I love anymore because I don’t want to hit her but I didn’t want to get lost either and yet here I am.
	I’m alone but I’m resolved.  My name is Archie and my dog Poe is with me and when a man has to do what he has to do he does it instead of not doing it because men do what men do because men do what men do…I need to stop and breathe.
	I’m resolved.  I lie prone and look to the Northeast and I see muzzle flashes, so I bring my rifle up and I exhale and I remember the training and my anger is gone.  I’m making progress.  I’m able to not be angry at Gooks when I don’t want to be but I’m in Vietnam and they’re trying to kill me and hating them makes it easier to kill them back but it’s 2012 and I need to find the nice Vietnamese man who brought us out here because I’m in the woods alone, but I’m headed West and that’s the direction where I can get back on the trail.
	I’m resolved to remember that my name is Archie and my nickname is Buck and Poe is at my side and I love my wife and she isn’t a part of the battle and I’m looking in the mirror now and I wonder where I’ve gone.  I wonder in 1984 and in 2005, and if I had a mirror I’d wonder now but if I had a mirror in 1970 I’d use it to look for muzzle flashes so that I don’t have to stick my head out but instead I stick my head out and I fire into the jungle but the battle is clearing.  I’m moving forward and I think I hear voices and I don’t remember if it’s a good thing but if I think for a moment maybe I can remember.
	I take a moment to remember what I can.  My thoughts are clear.  The war was years ago, and I came to terms with my flashbacks.  I’m a good man who would never deliberately hurt his wife.  I still have unease with the Vietnamese, but I’m getting better.  I’m getting better even as the Alzheimer’s makes things worse.  I turn and I see Poe looking at me, and for a moment I have all the willpower in the world.  I have all the willpower in the world but the sun is going down and it’s getting darker.
	I’m in the forest and it’s getting darker and I haven’t seen flashes of light in a while so I keep on moving hoping that I can reach camp sometime.  I’m alone but I’m resolved because my name is Buck and it’s my nickname but my real name doesn’t matter right now because my wife forgives me and that makes me feel better.  It makes me feel better until I remember that she forgave me in 1985 but she died in 1997 and I’ve been alone since then and I’m alone now except that Poe is with me and we’re in the forest so that we won’t be alone but the sun is going down and I don’t know if I’m going to make it.
	I’m going to make it I think though because I just have a feeling like maybe it doesn’t matter what year it is and it doesn’t matter what my name is because I’m in the moment and the moment is my memory and the forest is my memory and I am the forest and Poe and I are in the forest and even if I’m losing my mind I’m alive in it and maybe this is what time is really like and until we lose ourselves we don’t see it and maybe I am lost but I’m also not lost because it’s 1997 and I’m with my wife in the hospital and we’re saying goodbye and maybe this is hello.  I’m not really so sure I’m going to make it but I like to remember that my name is Buck and I see people and it’s a good thing and I remember my wife’s smile and I smile and the sun is almost down but that’s okay because the sun has to go down eventually but I made it to where I was going to go.

"c4pdbg3","I just went through this in philadelphia. Bait traps are the most enviormentally friendly and effective. Bait traps use a poison that the termites share between their whole tribe before it turns them to zombies that forget to eat and die, all of them. If you have damage already you don't really have time for bait traps to work because this method takes time, You need to stop them now. To do this you have to drill at the perimeter of your basment and any out side walls and pump a shit load of chemicals into the ground, less enviormentally friendly but fast acting. Most chemicals used to pump for termites suck. They only kill the termites they touch, pretty weak compared to bait traps. Terminex is different, they use the same type of chemical that is in the bait traps. It makes a perimeter around your house, then any termites that touches takes it back to the nest and shares it with everyone. Luckily for me I found a terminater that used to work for terminex, but now is on his own, using the same chemicals. I'd suggest either paying the dough for terminex or find someone else that uses the same chemical. It's called Termidor, I think. Another method I heard about is these mushroom spores. They're supposed to be planted, then eaten by the termites, shared with the tribe, and finally the mushrooms keep growning and explode out the termites' heads. Effective and sadistically satisfying. The best part is that after they're all dead the mushrooms stick around and defend against future invasions. Pretty badass, but I think they're only available out west.

Be flirty, but not romantic, have fun but don't put her in a situation that could turn awkward in a second because of misdirection and misreading her. Just keep it friendly, but cute. My favorite thing to do with a date, whether prom or just normal date, is to find an excuse to hold her hand. Like, if you're in a group, beat them to wherever your destination is. Grab her hand and just run. It's fun, and it's cute. Make sure that you don't grasp her hand too much after you've stopped running. She may keep her hand in yours, or she may not. Either way, it's a good read on how she's feeling. 

The key is just to keep things interesting and unexpected to give her the most fun prom experience she could possibly have. Don't do the whole roses thing. Find alternatives and clever things you can do to separate yourself from the usual awkward dance date, and leave a lasting impression on her when the day is over.

"c4j3wnx","Absolutely, with pleasure. It will be a long post, but it will contain a lot of useful information.

First of all, I'd like to emphasize the fact, that all I earned was based strictly on my practical knowledge. I don't actually like the alpha male society and philosophy, and I am not part of it.

**The important change I did between age 17 and 19 was my appearance.** I cut my hair (seriously guys, do it) and got rid of a terrible acne (using a hardcore medication based on reaccutane). I used to wear big t-shirts to cover my skinny body, but I threw them on the bottom of my wardrobe. I bought few fit t-shirts, bottom-ups and a pair of cool jeans. Gaining few kilos might have helped a little aswell.

**Then I started to fake my confidence.** With the moment of me entering the club or bar I started to act. With some time, it changed into a real confidence. With every girl I kissed, my confidence was bigger.

**Smile.** Not flirty, douche-baggy, but a warm and friendly one. I was surprised how it helped me, not only with women, but with dealing with everyday situations. There was no bitchy professor at my university who could resist my smile and humor.

**Humor. Being optimistic.** Some people say, that women have orgasm more often if they are having sex with a guy with some sense of humor. I started to joke with people. I'm not Jim Carrey, but even if my jokes were lame, girls were laughing anyway because they liked me. I act more optimistic than I used to do. It's a healthier concept and girls don't like depressed men.

**Worked on my own routine in clubs.** What I do to get laid. First, I go to the club with a group of friends (even better if there are some females in the group). It suggests that I am a sociable and likeable guy. I smile around and try to catch an eye-contact with the girls I like and smile. If one smiles back, I go over to her and start a chat. We dance, and I am friendly, but I don't flirt much or try to rip the clothes off her on the dancefloor. Kiss is the best she can get from me that night. I leave the club with her number, and I propose grabbing some beer the next evening. The next day, after grabbing 1-2 beers (always the same pub), I suggest going for some more beers to my place. And the game is on.

Of course, it depends on the night, but there is a very low possibility of failing the routine above.

**I always am the nice guy.** I know it destroys the concept that only douche-baggy guys get laid. No. Girls like nice guys who act confident more than doucheys. Some girls even told me that they slept with me mostly because of me being nice to them. In bed, I always let the girl come first during the foreplay. If she is happy, I am happy. And, if she had a good time with me, she will tell her friends about it.

I know, that you won't agree with some points here, but it's just a different philosophy. I checked it out and it works.

"c4iuzv0","I started lurking in this subreddit during the 2010 season.  

The individuals who've been added to the mod team since that time were individuals who actively contributed to that much smaller community (2k-4k subscribers?).  I still remember being blown away at the atmosphere that ACL's weekly analysis posts had.  And that statement does a disservice to the amount of work it felt like he put into them.  (I'm open to the idea that he is just 5x more talented than I, and he could write them up in 10 seconds.)  It took real caring and time to create certain baseline expectations of what this subreddit should expect from itself - back then and in the future.

Compared to any other sports forum I've frequented . . . I don't know.  It felt like finding the Holy Land.  A group of individuals who actually wanted to discuss predictions.  Acknowledged when predictions were the result of biases.  

I think part of what goes on is that football fan communities are often very team-focused and insular.  The ability to create rules and an atmosphere that all of us as fans can feel welcome is mind blowing to me.  That's the result of their work.

Looking over the game state might let you make a crucial play like Ghost Quartering the land they are beast within-ing (To stop them from making a token to give a Sword of Cash and Credit).  

**2.** **Write down life totals.** Don't use dice. **Use paper**. Paper can tell stories. Paper doesn't change if you hit the table or knock it with your drink. Paper can also record the contents of your opponents hand or how they beat you to help you figure out how to improve your deck.  

**3.** **You will lose.** I don't care who you are. I don't care how long you've played or how little you've played. You are going to lose at some point. This **is not negative**. This is a good thing. It means that ultimately you can know that you won't NEED to win every game. You can relax and enjoy the competition. A hard part for some people is that they don't win every game. Sometimes you just couldn't have won the game. This leads into #4 though...  

**4.** **You will make mistakes.** You will screw up and cost yourself a Grizzly Bears, or a card in hand, or a game, or a prize, or something. The **biggest mistake you can make is repeating an old one**. Use the paper from earlier to write down mistakes you made or what cost you games. Pay attention to avoid making mistakes. It minimizes the risk of costing yourself something you didn't want to lose. You aren't perfect though, mistakes will happen and that's okay. It brings us to #5.  

**5.** **Capitalize on your opponents mistakes**. If they swing a creature into a bad situation, don't be afraid to kill it and take advantage. Your opponent isn't perfect either. S/he might screw up and cost themselves the game. Pay attention and figure out if the play they just made is a mistake or a wolf in sheep's clothing.  

**6.** Look forward to the future. A key part of magic isn't just THAT game of magic. **Magic is about changing over time**. Magic is about changing your deck tweak by tweak to improve your ability to perform. It isn't about a single night or a single game. Use knowledge from previous games to help you build, play and win future games.  

**7.** Second most importantly, **Have Fun**. This is something you are spending YOUR free time doing. If you aren't having fun, try to find a way to make it fun. If that doesn't work, ask yourself if you want to do something else. It's your time and money, make it worth it.  

**8.** Most important: **Remember this is all to have fun**. This is different from having fun itself. This is about stopping things from ruining your experience/other peoples experience. Make your playstyle friendly but attentive to details.  
Be *polite* and **ruthless**.  
Make them *laugh*.  
Then **crush them**.  
Make it a fun competition that you'll both enjoy.

"c46bdgz","I was in a program that had a number of people working on queer theory who were gay men or butch identified lesbians. They had a lot personally invested in masculinity.

"c421lhe","30 something gaymer here in Seattle. I agree with almost all of what londonium and soundslikepuget said. Coming from the Midwest originally, I find Seattle far more liberal and livable than Kansas :)

Seattle is a gorgeous city most of the time, if a bit dreary outside of summer. As someone with SAD, I do have a lightbox to help me through the winters - the days get pretty short.

On the gay scene, I don't go to bars much, but there's something for everyone: Dance clubs (Neighbours, R-Place), Lounges (Lobby, Purr), Bear and Leather Bars (Eagle, Madison Pub, Cuff) all in a 10 block radius on Capitol Hill. The bars are mixed up with straight clubs too, so Cap Hill is a good night spot if that's your thing.

I've always found Seattle to be safe, but agree with londonium avoid belltown and pioneer square if you're alone at night. 

Depending on where you're moving from, expect some sticker shock. Washington state doesn't have income tax, so it all gets thrown into sales tax and higher than average prices on most goods. It's no New York or LA, but expect the higher cost of living than national average.

If you like coffee and lowkey, generally friendly but flakey people, and outdoorsy stuff out the wazoo, Seattle is fantastic.

"c3wn1zd","The US was missing four certain starters in Timmy Chandler, Landon Donovan, Oguchi Onyewu, and Jermaine Jones due to injury or illness.

Since when has being in midseason form been an excuse used by anybody for not playing well? Furthermore, the only player for the US that is not in the middle of his club season in Europe is Brek Shea - the only guy playing for the US that plays in MLS.

It is a friendly, but professional players tend to take games that contribute to their livelihood and reputation seriously. Italy was missing some guys and didn't come out as focused as they should have, but a loss at home is probably not going to endear them to their fans or engender confidence before the upcoming Euros. I'm willing to bet the Italians did not come onto the field with the thought ""I don't want to win today because this is a mere friendly against the lowly United States.""

Who's waving flags? I have spent most of my time here defending the US team as being at least as good as Mexico, because as soon as I expressed any optimism about the US's wins today and took a jab at Mexico's losses, somebody pointed out how Mexico won the Gold Cup over the US last summer.

I have not expressed any unreasonable delusions about how the US is now a top 10 team in the world simply because they beat Italy in a friendly. The US is not top 10 in the world, maybe not even top 20.

"c3wmxoa","I don't know your gender or your sexual orientation, but seeing as how you're posting about this on 2XC, I'm guessing you're a woman who's attracted to men. There are plenty of people here who aren't that (I'm one of them), so feel free to let me know if that's not the case.

But if that is true, here's the question I pose to you: would you date him? If not, why not?

If you said ""no"" to both of the above questions, the reasons you give are probably the same other people would give. It sounds like you really think highly of him and enjoy his company, and you really like him as a friend. That's probably how these other woman perceive him; he's really nice to be around and likeable...as a friend. I was pretty much the same way (and my friends probably would have said the same things about me), and I was perplexed for the longest time. But once I took some time away from attempting to date (I didn't ""give up,"" I just decided I didn't want to do it), I found that women were a lot more attracted to me sexually, and I eventually ended up having some pretty successful relationships. 

Looking back on it, I see a lot of differences in how I interacted with women before compared to how I do now. I'm still nice, supportive, and friendly, but the place I'm coming from is totally different. I'm not lonely and I don't have those doubts about being able to connect with women or being worthy of a relationship. I always did in the past, and I think it would always show through. It's because, when I was nice and friendly before, I wasn't acting like myself, I was acting like the sort of person I thought women wanted. That means that I would stifle my own feelings of frustration, annoyance, or anger, because I was afraid that would make me look like a bad person, or someone women wouldn't want to be with. 

In the past, I'd also rely on other people to deal with my emotional difficulties a lot of the time. Now, I still go to people when I'm upset, but I first try to deal with it on my own, with strategies I've tried in the past that I've found have been helpful (writing about it, going for a run, reading a book I enjoy, etc). I think it's that increased sense of self-reliance, confidence, and independence that has led to things getting better for me. When I was so shy and so unsure of myself, I was able to be friendly with women, but I could never really convey that I wanted a relationship or that I felt I deserved one. Women would pick up on that, and they'd only want to be friends with me.

So for what I'd tell your friend, I'd tell him to take some time to find out who *he* is and what *he* really wants outside of a relationship. If he can find a way to really be happy with himself on his own, talking to women will be more natural, and they'll be more drawn to him. That's not to say he won't still be rejected some; he will, and rejection sucks. But once he can really convey confidence and comfort with himself, he'll be a lot more successful with women, and relationships are more likely to develop naturally (rather than someone asking someone else out).",1330623397,"i'm still nice, supportive, and friendly, but the place i'm coming from is totally different.","supportive, and friendly","friendly",NA,TRUE,"supportive , and friendly","supportive",NA,NA,0

"c3swuci","Back before my wife and I got married, when we were still engaged, we had a three-fucks-a-day phase.  One day we had an especially epic fuckfest, which was remarkable only for its length (about two hours of uninterrupted humping).  Afterward, my dick went soft, but it didn't start to shrink back to flaccid size.  If anything, my foreskin looked a bit puffy.  We didn't think much of it though, because that sometimes happens after prolonged pounding.

And then my dick started to grow.

It stayed soft (in fact, it got really really soft), but it kept swelling.  By the time we made it to the emergency room, it was twice as long as normal and maybe four times as wide.  It was shaped like a cartoon teardrop.  Normal Caucasian dick-hue at the top, fading to bruised purple at the bottom.

They gave me a private room in the ER.  The male nurse took one look, winced, then left and came right back in with a male doctor (it was the quickest service I'd ever received at the ER).  The doctor's reaction was more controlled, but his face twitched when he first saw it.

They kept leaving and bringing in more staff.  None of them did any doctoring, they just came, looked, reacted, shot an appraising glance at my fiancée (who couldn't stop laughing), and then went to get someone else.  None of them told me who they were.  I swear some of them didn't even have nametags or anything.

Eventually they told me I'd burst a blood vessel.  They gave me a note to stay home from work for three days, and told me to stay in bed and keep my penis—I shit you not—iced and elevated.  This was in the summer, and the next day was especially beautiful.  I spent it lying on my back in bed, wearing just a wife-beater, with an ice pack between my chilled testicles and my frosty wang (thus keeping it elevated).  Around eleven I took off the ice pack and pulled on the thinnest, gentlest cotton pajama pants I owned and went out to the porch for a smoke.

The neighbors in the next apartment were over on their side of the porch, and I went over to say hi.  They were a young married couple—both 18—with a cute baby.  They were usually very nice and friendly, but this time the husband looked upset and wouldn't meet my eye.  His wife just stared at the ground with a beet red face.  I figured I'd interrupted a fight or something, so I excused myself and went back to my side of the porch.

Then I noticed it--the thin fabric of the pajamas was draped over my plainly visible dong.  You could see the bulk of it hanging there, you could see the massive veins running over the shaft, you could even see the curved lip of my fist-sized glans.

"c3qyp0v","Most of your questions have been answered, but I thought I'd chime-in too -- not wanting to be left out.

**Are you fond of American tourists?**
I often find American tourists to be friendly, but ignorant. They also have an expectation of customer service which just doesn't exist in most of the UK. Although that's getting better (read: more Americanised, ""Have a nice day!!"").

**What do you think of our president **
Of the office: a rallying point for Americans to claim bragging rights, with a lot of influence and patronage (people who owe him their jobs), but no real day-to-day power. Of the man: Obama seems to be sincere in his efforts to make America a fairer society. I think he's an intellectual, and probably the best man to be president in the next term.

**or our culture?**
American culture is so pervasive, it's almost difficult to tell where it ends and our own begins; especially since we have a shared history. American history is basically British history too, although we don't really teach it as such. From what I've seen, a lot of Americans take themselves very seriously which is at odds with the British (and especially Scottish) tenancy to be self-deprecating. Religion isn't nearly as important in the UK also, even among the religious.

**How ethnically diverse is it? **
By the last census count the entire UK had around 8% non-white, and Scotland had around 5% non-whites. Mainly based in larger cities. This will have surely increased by now, but we won't know until the 2011 census results are published. 

**What's the politics like?**
We have a Bi-cameral legislature. The lower chamber is the elected House of Commons and the upper chamber is the appointed House of Lords. The Commons has 650 Members of Parliament (MPs), who are elected to represent their constituencies. The Prime Minister and most of his cabinet reside in the Commons.  The Lords contains 800+ members who are selected by the government of the day (in the Commons) for their expertise and experience, they can serve on government but do not in great numbers as they do not have democratic accountability.

The UK also has 3 devolved parliaments in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. One for England was suggested, but ultimately rejected as it would represent 85% of the UK's population and therefore be a challenger to the UK Parliament. The main issue in Scotland right now is independence -- whether to succeed from the 300 year old union with England. A referendum is planned for 2015.

**What are the major parties like in the government?**
The general rule is that Labour should be trusted with schools and hospitals. And The Conservatives with policing and defence. The Lib Dems (3rd party) will promise anything to get votes as they have never - until now - been in government and had to actually implement any promises. Right now we have a coalition government between the Conservatives and the Lib Dems, although this is a novelty. The First Past the Post voting system usually produces a clear majority.

**What is school like?**
School is a devolved issue so it is different in each part of the UK. In Scotland, Primary School age is 4/5yrs-12yrs. Secondary 12/13yrs - 18yrs. University education is free to all Scottish people (and people within the EU), which is a bone of contention with our southern neighbours as they have fee rises incoming at the moment, and do not get free education in Scotland due to a legal anomaly. 

**One more thing**
One thing I would say. American people are cool, I - on the whole - like them. But our governments are not friends. We certainly do not have the ""special relationship"" that Churchill wanted so badly. It is, at best, a relationship of convenience. The US's actions (or lack-thereof) over the Falklands War - putting the Munroe doctrine above the so-called special relationship - is clear evidence of that.

I could connect all pictures to days on my itiniary, but for the love of god i couldn't remember one night morning: Turns out I had gotten really really drunk with friends in Tel Aviv and had taken pictures of a fire hydrant in the streets.

Since these were dated to the same day I allegedly had no memory of, everybody panicked.

I am walking down the very empty street, roughly where the sidewalk should be if it wasn't covered by snow, when a large police SUV comes from behind, and gets beside me, rolls down windows and a cop leans out and our conversation goes like this:  
  
cop - ""Hi sir, where you headed tonight?""

"c3qtqt4","We went through fertility drugs, IUI, and then IVF in our early-mid 30s. I might be able to offer some perspective.  

1) Have you looked into IUI? This would probably address the sperm count issue, at least. It's also MUCH less invasive and expensive. However, the thyroid issues might preclude it. Worth asking about, at least.  
2) In Canada, you're looking at about $10-13 thousand to go through a round of IVF. Other countries will presumably be comparable.  
3) Be prepared to learn how to give injections, as well as a massive emotional roller coaster. Consider that your wife is going to get probably 12-20 months worth of hormones in the space of a few weeks, and then put it in the context of a year and a half of PMS compressed into that same period. And that's just the hormonal emotions! You're also looking at the raw emotions of trying to get pregnant against the odds.  
4) Your schedule will be hellish. If you go down this path, tell your boss as soon as possible, and make sure he realises that you may have to take off on very short notice.  
5) The actual IVF implant procedure was excruciatingly painful for my wife, and emotionally draining as well.  
6) Fertility clinics are...clinical. The staff were all polite and friendly, but hardly empathetic. There was little to no recognition of how difficult it is to go through for the hopeful couple.  

If you decide to go for it, be prepared for the worst part of all: Ending it, without a pregnancy. IVF didn't work for us, and it was really hard to accept that there was no longer any point in throwing money and medicine at a problem that they *almost* certainly couldn't solve. (that *almost* was really tough for us, because our infertility was unexplained).  

This all sounds rather negative, and I have to say that I wouldn't go through it again. On the other hand, I have two friends who went through assisted fertility who had wonderful babies. One couple got pregnant from IUI, and the other had two kids from IVF. (Not twins - different pregnancies. But that does bring up an important point - multiple births are relatively common for assisted fertility.) If it had worked for us, I'm sure I would have said that it was worth all the hardship and pain.  

One last note: If it doesn't work, or you decide against it, there's always adoption. I was very leery of adoption, and am still a little sad that my dad's (awesome!) genes have ended at me and my brother, but we adopted, and now have a wonderful fantastic amazing exhausting four-year-old boy.  

Good luck, whatever happens. And be fantastic parents!

"c3nca37","My Slovenian is kind of shit since I've been out of the country for so long, but my English is good, so here is my translation of her statement:

**On Thursday, 26 January 2012, in accordance, and under the instruction of the government of the Republic of Slovenia, I signed the inclusion of Slovenia to the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA).** A somewhat **longer explanation** in regards to the signing can be found in the Media center of the websites of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which explains the contribution of MZZ, and also mine as the ambassador of the Republic of Slovenia in Japan. From the explanation, if follows that I signed the agreement because I was authorised to do so by the Republic of Slovenia, and because it was part of my job.

**But why did I sign ACTA? Every day through e-mail and Facebook, I am bombarded by questions, mostly friendly, but also irritated in nature, from people who do not understand why I would sign such a dangerous agreement to both the country and its people.** With this response, which is of an exclusively personal nature, and expresses only my own personal opinion, I wish to respond to them, friends and acquaintances who are silent, to the anonymous, and in the end, myself and my children.

**I signed ACTA from a civil negligence because I did not pay enough attention. Simply enough, I did not link the agreement, for whose signing I was authorised by my country, to that agreement, which in my civil opinion limits, and takes away freedom of operation on the largest and most important network in the history of mankind, and thus limits mainly the future of the generation of our children.** I afforded myself a period of civil peace of mind, for some time I disconnected from from the media reports from Slovenia, took a break from Avaaza and the inflation of its petitions - simply said, I gave myself a rest. In my defense, I tell myself that I really needed the rest, and that I am still having trouble gathering up the energy for a new year of the dragon. At the same time, I am trying to carry out the work that did not lessen with the arrival of the new year, if anything there is more than ever. Everything in the style of the [key?] that we - probably not just us diplomats - received in recent times; less for more *(I have no idea what the hell she is talking about here)*. Less money and less people for more work. And thus you overlook what it is you are signing. And the next morning you wake up with the weight of infinite lightness of some signature. *(again, no idea what she means by that)*.

**First I apologized to my children. Then I attempted to respond to the first acquaintances and strangers who marveled and were shocked. Because there are more and more, I am responding publicly. I wish to apologize, because, though I did fulfill my official duty, I did not fulfill my civic duty.** I do not know if I had the power to not sign, but I could have at least attempted it. I did not. I did not take the opportunity to fight for the right to conscientious objection from us bureaucrats.

**There is another, very important reason for my writing this. It is about a demonisation of *""some fool""*, that is, me, who had her hand in signing something in secret, far from home in Tokyo.** This was heard in the Slovenian Parliament and in the Slovenian media, and is spreading across the internet. It is dangerous mainly because it masks the responsibility of those who actually had the power of decision and actually made the call that Slovenia will join ACTA. The decision to join was made by the Slovenian government and the Committee of EU Affairs of the Slovenian Parliament, and before that Slovenia participated for quite some time in the coordination of the agreement. All of this was done not enough in front of the eyes of the public, according to the horrified responses that appeared after the formal signing. What to me seems very dangerous for the future (lack of) development of the democracy in Slovenia is that it was not just me that did not pay enough attention to the affairs of the government, we all failed as a people, in our civic duty. *(not to mention the opportunity for blah blah, something about the previous elections and how the government in slovenia is shit - that last part is implied)*.

**On Saturday, 4 February, a protest against ACTA will happen in Ljubljana.** The true worry and determination of the slovenian citizens, that we must stop the implementation of the agreement, will show in the number of people who will come join the rally. One of my concerned correspondents asked me what my brother, the late dr. Janez Drnovsek *(unimatrix: [""former"" communist and last president of Yugoslavia who was also the prime minister and later president of Slovenia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janez_Drnov%C5%A1ek))* would think. The fight to preserve our civil liberties is certainly in the spirit of his heritage, much more than the removal or non-removal of some statue. Saturday's rally is just one small step in this everyday struggle with no end. **Let my example serve as a warning of how quickly we make mistakes if we wane. If nothing else, we will have trouble falling asleep at night.**

Pre-gen characters: make up enough for the maximum players you're willing to seat at your table.  Know the characters or have copies for yourself as well to refer to.

Know the rules, but don't be afraid to just go with it: rules lawyering kills tables faster than an AT-ST kills ewoks.  If you don't know the exact rule off hand or the exact bonus?  just go with +2.  Seriously.

Know the material: unless you're a pro at running things on the fly, write up your adventure or print out or purchase it well in advance and read it at least 3 times before the convention. Ideally you should be able to run this without having to refer to the module (except maybe for stat blocks or large blocks of descriptive text to read to the players).

Be friendly, but firm: of course be friendly, don't be that ass that Rezzin posted about. But realize that there are different personalities that could sit down at your table all of whom are trying to have a good time.  If Shy Sally sits down to play and you have a Bossy Billy, then it's your job as the ref to tone Billy down and make sure that Sally gets to enjoy herself too. If you get someone who is too hard to handle and is killing the game for everyone, give them a polite warning asking them to stop.  If it's still not getting through, call convention staff to have them removed from your game.  It's shitty, but if they're spoiling everyone's fun.

"c3e7nt8","I agree with all the numbered points. A couple of things I'd point out:

* Enjoy yourself. Relax. You're playing a game for fun. Don't feel bad for being a draft noob. Some of your opponents might make you feel slow/incompetent/etc., but ignore them.

* You don't need to be lightning quick with all your actions: if you're swinging with everything, double check your combat math before hand. Be sure to shuffle your deck thoroughly when need be. DON'T be afraid to read every single card in it's entirety. I don't know how many time's I've gotten in trouble because I'm *pretty sure* I know what a card does.

* You do still need to play quickly. Use your brain, but there comes a point where you're just wasting time. While and opponent is considering what they could be doing on their turn, you should be thinking about your next turn. If you're on the losing side of the game, think about what cards it would take to get you out of the hole you're in. Losing quickly in game one gives you more time to win game three!

* Your opponent isn't your friend (well, unless it is your friend). You should be polite, courteous, and even friendly, but always be a bit suspicious. A lot of pro magic players are pro poker players, bluffing is the real deal. Try not to feel bad about getting the ultimate topdeck at the last minute, or winning due to mana issues. Also, ask the judge about rules (Philosophy's #3). If your opponent get's offended, tough luck.

"c3e0ks6","This isn't my story -- it's my dad's -- but it's the best story he's ever told me and contains some good life lessons. It's also a little dark and more than a little graphic so if you're squeamish be warned.

When my dad was nearing the end of his residency in medical school, he worked with an emergency room orderly named Hank who was about ten years older and who had been a combat medic in Vietnam. Hank had seen it all and was warm, funny, and friendly, but he took shit from nobody and if you got on his bad side you could find yourself the victim of a cruel joke. 

So one day a new guy from the county coroner's office arrives to pick up a body from the hospital to bring to the morgue. My dad and Hank are sent to help the guy with moving the body. They have to bring him to the main station to do the paperwork and then physically help him retrieve the body and bring it out to the van. At this point it's worth mentioning that this was at Los Angeles County Hospital in the 70's. At that time that part of town was overrun with heroin and gangs, and my dad spent most of his days there sewing up knife and gunshot wounds and getting puked on by drunk homeless guys. So my dad had seen some shit and Hank, a fucking Vietnam vet, had seen quite a bit more. Anyway the guy from the coroner's office immediately starts asking them if they'd seen many messed up bodies and telling them all about the horrific accident sites his job had taken him to and really relishing the details: decapitations, charred corpses -- stuff that is part of the job but not part anyone dwells on, let alone raises as a topic of conversation because a) it's creepy, b) it's sad, and c) a lot of hospital orderlies at that time were Vietnam vets who would rather not talk about how cool dead bodies are. My dad and Hank agree this guy is a creepy bullshitter and they decide to see what he's really made of.

While my dad is filling out the paperwork with the guy, Hank goes on ahead to the refrigerated room where they hold the bodies. He goes inside and holds his arm and hand against the cold wall next to the door for a few minutes while he waits with his back against the wall next to the door. Meanwhile, the guy is still going on about all the ""crazy fucked-up shit"" he's ""seen"" as he and my dad arrive at the cold room. My dad opens the door and flips on the light. The guy stops mid-sentence, and with his mouth hanging open and horror in his eyes he slowly takes in the view before him: rows of dead human bodies, of various ages and weights, some with grievous wounds, hanging in clear plastic body bags from hooks in the ceiling. You can't see it and not think ""meat locker"", but with people. After the longest two seconds in the guy's life Hank's cold, limp arm drops down from nowhere around the guy's neck and the guy screams and shits in his pants. My dad and Hank laugh until their ribs hurt while the guy runs back to the van and flees. In the end my dad and Hank had to clean up some of the guy's shit but it didn't really matter since as ER orderlies they spent a lot of their time doing that anyway, and the coroner's office had to send someone else to make the pickup.

"c3cehbd","You can read about Jinns in general through the links I gave before.

http://www.jinndemons.com/jinnat-in-islam/

http://islamqa.info/en/ref/140630

The source of exorcisms are sort of like secrets I am not privy to but they mainly use incantations from Quran and other holy scriptures. Certain verses of Quran are considered more powerful and considered important for certain type/level of Jinnat. 

The practice that I am talking about mainly revolves around reasoning with them. They are considered conscious reasonable beings who tend to follow rules. Those using humans for their own devices are like criminals in their own world also unless they follow proper procedures. Note how they held a jigra and decided rather then everyone just ripping my grandfather apart. Their youngs and hot blooded can of course get angry and do wrong things. Each exorcist has a few companion Jinnat which you gain as part of training. Actually, this is interesting, let me expand on this.

When you are becoming an exorcist, you participate in a ceremony to call upon a jinn in presence of your mentor. He is just invited for talking, sort of like coffee for humans. :p. Most of them are non-hostile so mentor just sits and does nothing. If things go bad, he steps in and saves the new exorcist. Anyways, certain verses are likely to yield more powerful Jinnat and certain verses yield weaker ones. If you invite someone too strong vis-à-vis your level of training, you will be rejected and in worst case harmed. If you invite someone too weak, he has too little power and influence to be able to help in most cases.

Furthermore, the process of calling is random; you can never invite specific jinn. You can just open a portal in one of their specific areas and hope someone strong comes through. You cannot force them. In certain sessions, no one may bite and you may have to repeat.

Remember, they are your equals, not slaves. Furthermore, even though they can reject you, you cannot reject them. It’s not considered polite. So if some real weak fellow comes and likes you, you have to keep him. 
Each exorcist starts small and as you gain more training and need stronger companions, you open portals in higher levels and get someone stronger. Each companion you gain will have power/influence in certain areas. Let’s say you get leader of a particular tribe. Now, all member jinn of that tribe will be easy to exorcise as you can tell your companion jinn to get them to fuck off and they have to listen.

However, let’s say you have a companion who is a leader of a tribe which is at war with/not happy with the jinn you are exorcising. Now, even though your companion is much stronger, he is useless in immediate situations. He will have to contact the leader of other tribe or higher ups (through proper channels) which he may not be willing to do if he doesn’t feel it’s in his best interests. Remember, they are only friends, they don’t agree to everything. You cannot have too many or your previous friends will leave you as you appear too greedy/needy. You have to maintain friendship with them by talking to them and remaining friendly even after you have acquired them. Companion you get is random so truly powerful exorcists not only have to train, be talented, friendly but also lucky! That’s a lot to ask.

So that’s how basic exorcism is done. You try to use influence/power of your friends to reason with the offending jinn. There is no guarantee he will agree. You try to get your companion to follow through proper channels. Again, may not work or may be taking too much time. They are as bureaucratic as us, if not worse. They follow honour/tribal rules. So then you try to hurt/harm so others can’t blame you later as you tried everything else. Jinns allow their own to be hurt if they are found to be doing something wrong.

Most details are from my first playthrough. FemShep, Soldier, Paragon, no LI.

ME1:

* **Jenkins: 4/10**. Initially a perfect 5/10 in that I don't care about him in the slightest, it got worse when I realised that he was the suicidal rookie talking to Chakwas.
* **Kaidan: 5/10**. Not particularly interesting at first, but he started to get better later on. Unfortunately that's when he started to think he had a chance with Shepard, and she stopped visiting when she realised. Never went on a mission once there were other options.
* **Ashley: 2/10**. Initially an interesting character, but then I found out she was xenophobic and religious. And then she shot Wrex. She didn't make it off Virmire.
* **Garrus: 6/10**. A nice guy, who would have seen a lot more action if not for Tali.
* **Wrex: 9/10**. Our favourite grumpy krogan merc. Was present on almost every mission up until Virmire, where he was shot in the back.
* **Tali: 10/10**. Delightful to have around, told interesting stories, and her tech expertise meant Shep didn't have to learn any of it. Was present on *every* mission after she was recruited.
* **Liara: 8/10**. Earnest and friendly, but rarely left the ship, since Wrex was also a biotic.

ME2:

* **Jacob: 5/10**. Completely uninteresting. The memorable loyalty mission would have boosted him to a 6/10, but a few insensitive comments to some of the other squad members negated that.
* **Miranda: 1/10**. My single most detested character. Never shows enough competence to justify her arrogance, and her constant lies were very off-putting. Survived the suicide mission, unfortunately.
* **Mordin: 6/10**. Pleasant to have aboard, but his voice was irritating during combat, so he only ever went on one mission.
* **Garrus: 8/10**. Great to see him again. Again, only went on a few missions but was helpful on them.
* **Jack: 9/10**. Not very *nice*, but she hates Miranda as much as Shepard does. More of a complex character than she seems at first. One of the most common choices to take on a mission.
* **Grunt: 4/10**. He's certainly no substitute for Wrex.
* **Tali: 10/10**. One of the few people on the SR2 that Shepard could really trust. Not as useful on missions this time around, so she only went on a few of them before being swapped out.
* **Samara: 9/10**. It's nice to have someone as calm as she is. Another of the most common for my Shepard to bring along.
* **Thane: 6/10**. Not the most interesting of the team, but I had no objections to him until he fell into the same trap as Kaidan. Apparently Shepard needs to be less friendly to the male crew.
* **Legion: 7/10**. Fascinating to have around, but Shep could never chose it over Tali.
* **Kasumi: 8/10**. Mysterious and competent, and quite likeable. Quite a good chance of being in the squad for any given mission.
* **Zaeed: 3/10**. A little irritating.",1324701799,"earnest and friendly, but rarely left the ship, since wrex was also a biotic.","earnest and friendly","friendly",NA,FALSE,"earnest and friendly","earnest",NA,NA,0

Fossil records show that man has existed for nearly 1/2 a million years (depending on your definition of mankind). 

I am trying to work with your biblical account on the subject, from genesis, which is a bit fuzzy, I though God created man on day 6.

http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+1%3A27-31&amp;version=NIV

""So God created mankind in his own image"" ... ""the sixth day"".

But it is a bit confusing because the second story of the bible contradicts the first part, so excuse me if I get the dates wrong. Also days don't see to mean days so that is confusing also. (Makes you wonder what does mean what)

I will stick with the NASA story thank you very much, as corroborated by almost every scientist who has studied the subject. If there was evidence found to the contrary, then scientists can open it to peer review and if proven correct, it will become the new figure.

The only life we know exists while we are alive. I plan to live well while I am here. If there is an extra life after this one, I will enjoy that one too. But until there is some evidence that it exists I will not put false hopes into something that is a rumour started 1000s of years ago. One of many rumours, most of which contradict each other.

I can see Bob, I can speak to Bob and hear his reply (actual words that make sounds that can be measured on recording equipment). I can throw an object at Bob and it will bounce off and Bob will get upset. I use a recording device to hear the sounds that Bob makes. I can observe the flow of air into and out of Bob (if I colour the air). I can physically touch Bob and actually feel his presence. I can weigh Bob on a scale and see that he measures on equipment. If I had the equipment, I could also measure the gravitational force created by Bob. More, the results are consistent. I can do this day or night, over and over and get the same results. I can ask someone else to run the tests and they will get the same results. No matter whether they believe Bob exists or not, the evidence is the same no matter what your personal position is to the existence of Bob. Yep, I can gather some pretty good evidence that Bob exists. I do not need to rely on him telling me.

This is what evidence is. Repeatable, measurable and unbiased. It should not matter who gathers the data or  examines the evidence they should get the same result. It is not one freak occurance or unusual result.

I have been keeping up.

The brain may not be completely stopped and the memory is stored in the synapses. Our measurement of brain activity is restricted to the outer layers. Normally this would progress to complete brain inactivity, but not always. I have not seen any convincing evidence that people have been able to accurately describe events unknown to them while they are in this state. I know that some scientists are trying to uncover this and I look forward to seeing the scientific results, not random one off comments and unsubstantiated rumours.

I did not say that that it could not possibly be a ghost. I mearly said that I would still be sceptical and want a full investigation. I would like to rule out other factors first. Many photos are faked (not saying this one is). Many photos contain images that we see because of other factors.

I am sure you have seen photos such as this one - http://bitsandpieces1.blogspot.com/2006/09/jesus-image-found-in-dogs-butt.html

I think that is quite funny. But regardless, I certainly can see an image of Jesus in the dogs butt. Do you think this is Jesus? It is more likely to me to be just a pattern that our brain processes. See the wikipedia article on [Pareidolia ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareidolia). This is the most likely explanation for these images, but investigation is required.

I am sure you also saw the picture of the face on Mars http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cydonia_(region_of_Mars) . This showed that we were not alone in the universe and that some alien lifeform had placed our image on the surface of Mars. That was of course until man took a closer look. See the later imagery in the same article and saw that it was just a mirage, a Pareidolia. 

Humans see images that are not there all the time. They are often called optical illusions and are the basis of a magicians tricks. Full investigation is required. Lets not rule out the possibility, but lets investigate thoroughly for alternate explanations before jumping to conclusions. Also tests need to be repeatable to be considered reliable. And by multiple groups of people, not just one off with potentially faulty equipment.

I've been stopped by the police several times while carrying and I've never had any issue to complain about.  I've been detained what I thought was an unusually long time but I think that was more attributable to lack of experience than racism.

I take quite a few training classes and I compete locally and I'm discipline director of a 2-gun match and everyone has been overwhelmingly awesome.  No negative experiences when it comes to race at all.

Gotta factor in things like how you carry yourself, how old you look, how experienced you are in the field, how impressive your recent contributions have been, how confident you were in your interviews, how quickly you agreed to the original salary range, things like that.

Starting point:  If you've been in the industry less than say 5 years, start in the middle of the salary range, maybe slightly below.  More than that, I'd say somewhere between 60 and 75% of the max?  I tend to play it safe though.

"c2ymz8b","Welcome!

Unless budget is a major issue, if you're getting a mobile get a dual band mobile (2m/440).

Get a decent mag mount dual band antenna, with a wide base (at least 4"").  Now cover the bottom to prevent paint scratches- a single layer of electrical tape or duct tape will work fine (just don't overlap) and one around the edge to keep that tape from peeling off.  Now blast it with a lighter or heatgun to melt the tape in a bit, and you have something that can be safely used on any vehicle.  This is partially why I say use a wide base antenna- the thickness of the tape will reduce the magnetic force, so use one that has plenty to spare.

When getting mobile mag mount antennas, if you aren't finding something good get a NMO magnetic base and a NMO antenna to screw onto it.  That will greatly increase your selection of antennas.

Mobile radios often take more power than a cigarette lighter can put out.  Carry a few spare auto-style fuses.  Use medium power when possible if you're powered from a lighter socket.

Consider joining the ARRL.  Opinions vary on them, but I think overall they try to be useful.  They have an excellent pocket sized repeater guide that can be had for around $10 at a hamfest, it'll help you find the repeaters wherever you go.  Their magazine QST isn't bad either.

Also look for local ham groups in your area.  ARRL's website has a good club finder thing on it.  Join that and go to the meetings when you can.

The general consensus around pit bulls was that they were genuinely friendly dogs until those who fought dogs realized that they had the ability to be good fighters. Watch a documentary on dog fighting and you will realize how naive you are right now. I was the same way until I took a course at my University about it.

As a nation, you do come across as somewhat arrogant/self-obsessed. In my home country, you're more likely to hear us talk about what a shithole the place is than how great it is. Add that to the fact that we have a fairly fractured cultural identity (I'm from NI), and patriotism is pretty much a foreign concept. It just seems weird.

The Americans I've come into contact in uni.. yes they are fairly outgoing and friendly, but for god's sake is it necessary to be so loud? Seriously, you can talk to your friend without being so loud that I'm wincing despite being two closed doors away. And you can knock on the door instead of standing outside it screaming a person's name. (Again this may not be true of all or even most Americans, just sadly the ones I have had close contact with.)

I'm not going to pretend to have enough political knowledge to really comment on most of it. And, to be honest, our politics (both in NI and England where I'm currently studying) are fucked up enough that I can't really talk. But your healthcare system and employment laws seem to be fucked up. The idea that in a modern, developed country people can't get medications they need to live just seems so, so wrong. The NHS has its faults, but that just disgusts me. 

And despite not being a huge drinker, the 21 age limit annoys me a little. Seems ridiculous that an adult can't drink alcohol if they wish.

Everyone here is very chill and friendly, but I do have to warn you about how expensive it can be. Due to inflation, the money you save in the States will be worth a lot less to you over here (i.e. everything over here is 2-3x more expensive, but their minimum wage is around twice what you get in the states, depending on where you live.) 

Sydney in general is very expensive though. I've heard that once you get out of Sydney, pretty much any place in Australia will be cheaper (with the exception of Perth). My advice really depends entirely on what you are looking for when you come here. If you want to travel a lot, then make sure you save up enough and don't stay in one place for too long as it will drain your funds and you'll be stuck in one spot working your way out of there. If you're looking to stay long term in Sydney, then get a shared apartment as opposed to a hostel. It will be cheaper, roomier, and you'll make more long-term friends as people won't be moving in and out every other day. Try to secure work before you get here if possible. If you have experience in a particular field,  you can always go through agencies to help you out with getting employment. Partying it up might be a lot of fun, but it's expensive as hell over here due to the price of alcohol (in one nightclub I paid $10.50 for one jagerbomb).

"c2sut4o","I don't know how to respond to this briefly. I'm 35, been in Portland 2+ years now while being genuinely out going even if it's a struggle when I get repeated negative reactions to my personality, and I happen to work regular office hours downtown for a large 3000+ local insurance employer. My co-workers have been here, some of them, longer than I have been alive. 

I met one guy I share niche things in common with 2 years ago and about once ~a month one of us will get together to hang out. To his credit, he works weekend night shift and so our work schedules conflict. I suspect this is true of a lot of Portlanders. It seems the only people who are able to *make time* are ones that either don't have a set in/out office schedule or freelance. 

A lot of people don't leave their neighborhoods or if they leave the tiny swath of 20 blocks that is a Pdx neighborhood they don't venture out of their respective quad often. Basically, you'd be hard pressed to find me lounging in the NE or the SW in my spare time. Even though I go a lot of places and do a lot of things it always strikes me when my outside Pdx friends are in town how little I know of things outside the inner SE. 

My friends from Philadelphia came through on tour twice this year and both times I was invited to hang out with them after their sets. I also had another friend stay with me last summer from Philly. I was only in that city &gt;1 year. If I extend an invitation to the guy who lives 5 blocks from me to engage in a mutual shared interest activity together on his extended ""we should hang out sometime"" invitation I'll get a repeated *soft no* that he's just a really busy guy. When you live in a town full of busy people who are polite without committing to any actual plans [a lot won't even reply to a text but will deny ever seeing it if you bump into them] it's just hard to know after a while if there's a memo / hint you're supposed to have clued in on. Maybe it's not all people or people **you know personally** but it's still a lot of god damn people I keep running across locally. And some busy people really are damn busy but I see those people making time for social activities constantly. Hence, their plate always being full.

So it's not as though I'm sitting in my room contemplating my navel lint but while people at local shows are very friendly I don't get past the nod. It startled me a bit when the last Laughing Horse Books show involved a local dude I see often being like ""HEY, how have you been???"" I regarded it in a friendly but aloof way only thinking later I was being Portland cold. 

I think this town is pretty transient in nature. It seems like somewhat of a revolving door for quite a few people who can't break even with the depressed job market, the strangulation on housing, the overall expense that gentrification whitewashing hip areas of the city places on those who struggle and alienation from connections back home. Add the struggle to put down roots and have a social support system to the culture shock of seasonal depression this time of year. Maybe the acquaintance syndrome is a way for old-timers to vet people until they consistently show up?


I know there's a lot of meet ups with locals on this board but I feel really awkward, even being socially out-there, showing up alone as a single person female meeting strangers outside my comfort zone. I also don't drive so it's hard for me to be spontaneous. This town is hella spread out even in the inner zones. When I talk to my friend across the country I can sell the fuck out of Portland to them but when I talk about the *people who inhabit this city* it falls on its face.

"c2ro0bg","Ok so I'm SoFla. Idk if the distance is a prob or if it'll take some of the pressure off for a while. M/26/6'1"". Fulltime professional. FAU Honors grad (English). I have a fascination with sociology and psychology. Politics... not so much, but I'm pretty openminded. 

Intense doesn't intimidate me none whatsoever ;) I was homeschooled k-12, but surprisingly well adjusted according to most. I got a few ride or die friends and that's how I like it. I only go for LTRs. I'm a no games, heart on my sleeve, glass half full type of person.

My interests are very broadranging. For example, I saw Wicked on Broadway and danced on stage w/Skrillex within the last month and going to ICP/Twiztid next week up in your neck of the woods. I read classics and sci-fi/horror/fantasy, graphic novels, and poetry and much more. I don't have a favorite anything or an addictive personality (unless it's adrenaline). 420 friendly but clean. Drink socially (mmm Merlot), smoke cigars on occasion.

I like club dancing every now and then (I've worked for Ultra...). Would be interested in other forms but haven't done any in a hot minute. Art museums are a yes deff and I won't go anywhere without hitting up their library. You will eat a lot of sushi if we hang out. I don't tv or radio, I'm bad with movies but always down to watch classic/art/foreign films or w/e you have on. I don't shy away from chick flicks just expect me to slide in some cheeky one-liners about Edward and Jacob on the way home lol. I'm a bit of a speed demon (drop top GT and race-ready GSX-R...), so brace yourself.

"c2prmr0","I (American female) did a solo trip around the world shortly after college and would highly recommend it - depending on where you go, there's usually a lot of people there doing the same and it's easy to make friends (Southeast Asia is great for this especially).

I lived off the Rough Guide books - definitely check them out, best guide book I've encountered. They'll give you lots of tips on what to expect, what the visa rules are like, what the medical system is like, cool places to visit, etc.

I'd also recommend STA Travel - they have a lot of cheap travel deals. I did a custom around the world ticket with them and they have their own pre-made flight packages as well. Even if you're not going through them for a flight, they know about a lot of student deals. Lots of places consider anyone under 25 a student so it can be useful even after you're out of college.

New York is a great place to prep yourself for solo travel because it's such an international city. I'd recommend going by yourself (during the day) to neighborhoods you wouldn't normally feel comfortable in - areas dominated by one ethnic group that you don't belong to, or places you'd usually stay away from because you wouldn't feel safe.  A large part of solo travel is having to be ok with feeling unwelcome and getting stared at for looking different. It's also important to feel and overcome fear, and to learn how to walk with casual confidence while still being completely aware of your surroundings. 

Be sure to do a lot of research on the place you're going to make sure you'll have as little surprises as possible (don't worry, you'll have plenty no matter what).  I was uber prepared - I even got myself a prescription for the morning after pill while in France (researched their medical laws) just in case there was a worst case scenario where I was raped on my trip. Know what the scams are and how to avoid them. Anywhere that has tourism will also have people trying to scam tourists, so be friendly but cautious with people you meet on the street.

Happy to answer any questions you may have. Solo travel is an amazing experience and I probably learned more on my 4 month trip than I did in 4 years of college. Definitely a worthwhile investment!

For example, my first time renting with them I went in to get my keys. They gave me the keys and all was right with the world. But when I got home and tried to use the mailbox key, it didn't work. Tried the other two (we had 3 tenants), and neither of them worked. Went back the *next* day, and was told, ""Oh yeah, the USPS changes the keys every year to prevent theft. Here are your new updated keys, but we need to keep one for ourselves so you only get two keys.""

I don't know why she gave me the old keys when she had the new ones. I don't know why they didn't make an extra key for themselves so that we would each have a set of keys that is written out in the damn lease. I don't know why she pretended like this was completely okay and normal.

"c2g8wsr","Back Story...

I had been working as a second tier support technician for a fairly large corporation for about 6 months, supporting both Mac and PC users.  The support team I was on consisted of a drunken hillbilly imbecile (we'll call him Keith) and a bitter, middle-aged grumpy asshole (we'll call him Bill).
 
Well, I sit in a cube and opposite the wall I face is Bill's cube.  Across the aisle is Keith, who always speaks as if he is at a rock concert.  In other words, I can hear him through concrete walls.  Bill hates me with a passion because I took half of his responsibilities as well as the role of Mac Technician to help the creative team stay productive, which he argued that we didn't need in the first place.  Keith hates me because he spouts racist and socio-political hate speech all the time and I call him out on it...every...single...time.  The guy couldn't STAND to be wrong, even when presented with mountains of evidence proving it.

This is where it gets good  :)

For about 3 weeks, someone had been moving stuff around on my desk.  At first, I thought it was one of the interns (who were all really cool and friendly) but I figured out it couldn't have been them because we would go to lunch together and my stuff would be moved.  So that means it was either Keith, Bill, or a ghost.  
One day I go to lunch and have a brilliant idea...I TURN ON PHOTO BOOTH ON MY MACBOOK!  I stuff my laptop in the corner facing the doorway of my cube and off I go.  It took my a couple days, but I finally caught BOTH Keith and Bill rifling through my shit, moving shit around on my desk, AND I catch them talking shit behind my back to each other while they do it.  

Now, I'm not a violent person, nor am I someone that would react irresponsibly towards this event.  But this made me fucking FURIOUS!  I compiled the data into a single movie on my Mac, slapped it on a DVD, and walked my ass on over to HR.  The human resources guy was taken aback by the footage I was able to get.  He'd never seen someone come in with actual video evidence of their complaint regarding another co-worker.

Fast-Forward a few months...Keith left the company because he got denied a managerial position (hmmm, big surprise there) and Bill is still working the same shitty position he had before with a dot on his record for harassing a fellow employee.  I left the company shortly after Keith to finish my bachelors and now I have a cushy engineer position with a small, yet awesome software company  :)


**TL/DR...I caught my co-workers on tape, fucking with my shit and I gave the video to HR and fucked em right back  :)  Felt good**

That looks like a great idea.  Train is clearly the cheapest way to get around, although Norway isn't ideal for budget travel at all. Oslo just got ranked the most [expensive city in the world](http://www.citymayors.com/economics/expensive_cities2.html).

Season: This is entirely subjective. If you like cold: October-April would be ideal. A little less cold: May-Sept. Summer can sometimes be pretty hot, but it's been rare the last couple of years.

North-Cape: Not too hard. Not hard at all actually. There's tons of infocenters in Oslo where you can get help. Most Norwegians also speak English very well, so I wouldn't expect this to be a problem at all.

Hitchhiking: Not so much this. I don't know why, though. I always pick up hitchhikers if I have the time, but I don't think its very common throughout the country. You will eventually get picked up by someone, that's for sure, it just might take a while.

Backpacking=Boredom and frustration: I think not. Most Norwegians are friendly and helpful, and you'll have no trouble getting around. You might be frustrated by the high prices, though. Again; Everything is really fucking expensive over here. 6pack of Tuborg (which is considered as a cheap beer) = 30 USD.

Hostels: Ask around. There's always somewhere to sleep. Have you considered [courchsurfing](http://www.couchsurfing.org/)?

Attitude: I see Norwegians as generally friendly, but there's bad eggs in every part of the world. I am confident you wont have any problems with ""hostile Norwegians"".

I can tell you that with the Taleo Applicant Tracking System, when it parses resumes submitted it divides included files into Cover, Resume, maybe Resume #2.  

Because I and every other person in the office is stretched on time (and again because you want to get right to the experience) we very rarely ever open the cover letter.

In the 80s and 90s, you'd hear about the proverbial manager's desk piled sky high with resumes on paper, stapled, some different colors so they could stand out from the other one.  That rarely ever exists any longer.  Managers and recruiters don't usually print out resumes unless it's the person they want to interview already.  The ""stack"" of resumes is now electronically a number among hundreds of others in a database.

This is why it's important to concentrate more on making your resume detailed and attractive.  Nearly ever cover letter I've read is humanistic and nice and friendly, but it's all fluff.  

Sorry to carry on, but yes, if you're going to spend any time on a cover letter give it some bullets if you like, but make it a painted portrait of what you've done in the past and how you match up to that specific job.

These are beef cattle though and the end goal is to get them pretty fat, for dairy you could probably get by on a bit less.

It's a cheap way of getting yourself some hay which would have been wasted otherwise.  In the winter you'll probably going to have to supplement anyway,  so you'll need it. 

I rotate them between fields twice a year, cows are nice because they won't overgraze like a horse will and destroy a pasture completely,  but it's still nice to let it rest for a bit. 

I do suggest starting off small though,  one or two which you mention you are doing.  It's a good way to figure out what you're getting into without being trampled by hungry cows.

In certain places, precautions were taken I think. In Egypt we had police and army protection mostly to prevent us being bothered by ""overly curious"" Egyptians rather than for our true safety (I think). We took a route by the Red Sea rather than the much more populated Nile Valley. On those times we did cycle through populated areas most people were extremely friendly but male children from about 11 to 18 were a potential problem - throwing sticks and stones, spitting etc. I certainly kept my eyes peeled.

Sudan is probably the safest country I've been too ...

Ethiopia was a little dodgy, again due to children throwing stones.  However here the age range of potential trouble-makers was a little broader. I've had children who looked to be about 2 or 3 years old throwing stones at me. Most of the children were nice, but there are *so* many kids (8 births per woman, 3 die average) that stone throwing children were a very big part of the Ethiopia experience. We had a team of 3 or 4 local guides to look after us and help smooth out any ""issues"".

Northern Kenya we had about 8? soldiers (including a sniper :) ) from the Kenyan Wildlife Service protecting us from the apparently genuine threat of bandits (never had any trouble though). South of Nairobi though we didn't have or seem to need any protection.

I walked through all sorts of *totally* poor areas where you might expect to feel very vulnerable but my experience is that African's are generally *such* decent people that in the unlikely event I got into any trouble a crowd of locals would have quickly appeared to make sure I was OK.

"c21m1d4","I agree with much of what you say about the EU, which started as the civil version of NATO - in order ""to control the spread of communism"" - and has become whatever any one nation wants to believe it to be. Amorphous, therefore, and without a clear goal. 

That said, there exist two socioeconomic dynamics which produce contradictory political repsonses. These are by no means restricted to the EU. One of these is the urge to geographical solidarity, and the other is international competition. 

The ""solidarity"" issue holds that everyone who is a citizen of a given country is to be supported by everyone else in the style that they have learned to enjoy. Well, fine; that is a choice, an expensive choice, but one that gains votes. However, it is in direct contradiction to the issues raised by international competition. 

Low skill individuals - unless supported by high capital investment, in the shape of e.g. automation - are often unable to compete with low wage, high skill areas. In a purely economic world, their wages would be expected to fall until they could compete: that is, to roughly the same wages as are paid in Asia or wherever it is that is in competition with them. British farm wages collapsed in the 1870s, for example, when new shipping and farming technologies brought in produce from the US, Canada and Australia.

The national economy will always perform better if low cost goods and labour are allowed into it. However, low skill workers will tend to see their wages fall as a result of this. For example, the influx of low wage workers from New Europe into the countries of Old Europe has brought down artisan wages by a large factor: by more than half in London, for example. An electrician previously charging £200 a day will now get £70-90 per day. That is excellent for the customer and the economy, but not good for the British electrician. The same is true where the embodied value can be shipped around, for example, as engine parts or integrated circuits. 

This provokes two contradictory responses in politics. One says: increase skills and capabilities, compete directly. US productivity was such that Mexico lost jobs when NAFTA was formed. German productivity allowed its wages to be double that of Spain, and it was Spain that lost the jobs. 

The other political response is to protect ""our"" people with tariffs, quotas; by subsidising firms to employ staff at higher wages than they would otherise get - in agriculture, for example - and by creating state sector non-jobs to keep people busy. The North West of England has about 65% of its economy and 85% of its employment directly sponsored by the state. This is voter-friendly, but ultimately ruinous, as we have seen. 

The Euro was a particularly damaging institution for inefficient countries. If you can devalue your currency, you can probably continue indefinately with low efficiency and static wages. If you pin your currency, then all that is open to you by way of adjustment is either to cause wages to fall, usually through high unemployment, or to borrow to make up the difference. Spain's unemployment had to rise to 25% in order to force wages low enough so that it could maintain its external balance. Other Mediterranean states simply borrowed and hoped that the problem would occur on someone else's watch. The banking crisis brought this to a head. Very much the same dynamics were evident in the US after the dollar was universally adopted. Unemployement soared and wages fell in states like Kentucky and Tennessee, whilst those in the North-East rose.

What is to be done? Well, the cost of keeping the maflunctioning states in the Euro until they gain the required competitiveness is going to be vast. The political cost of pushing them out of the Euro is also vast, but probably more acceptable to the average citizen of the potential supporter nations in the Eurozone, such as Germany. An acceptable fudge might be a two speed Euro: the real thing, and a training wheels version in which central bank and fiscal policy was tightly restricted and the ""local Euro"" allowed to devalue until it hit equilibrium.

"c1xgn2r","I guess there are racists everywhere, and as far as treating you differently is concerned, be it consciously or subconsciously, it probably takes different forms depending on where you go. Only an Asian American who has first hand experience could tell you what the differences would be, and from what I gather, s/he would even have to be from the same part of the US as you.

I wouldn't feel comfortable saying it would be better in Germany or another European country. One reason is that I'm simply not in a position to make that call, and the other is that, yeah, of course people here have stereotypes as well, and some even are proper racists. Are there more or less of them over here? I don't know, but odds are it would be *different*, for better or worse. My guess is that after just a few days on a vacation, you'd be in a better position to answer that than I ever could.

So, take all of the below with a grain of salt, but there are a couple of things to consider.  
One important aspect are general cultural differences. If you don't take that into account, then you *will* perceive culturally perfectly normal behavior as discrimination, even though it wouldn't (necessarily) be because of your Asian heritage.  
From what I've heard, we're generally considered to be blunt and cold. This is probably true, because the German perception of Americans is exactly the other way round, as very open and friendly but ""superficial,"" in that you're quickly called a friend, that ""you should come over for dinner some time,"" but it doesn't really mean all that much. I've come to accept Americans talking badly about ""friends"" as something that goes with the language. Making friends takes a lot of time over here, especially if you have to ""break into"" existing circles. However, if you'd come over for a Master's, many of your fellow students would be in the same position as you.  
Apparently it's also more common to be stared at, especially if you stand out one way or the other.

(Re-reading the above, that probably was very ""direct."" Take it as a cultural exercise.)

In other countries, there would be similar effects. For example, the Brits are [notorious](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6uhxH924ao) for their stereotype based ~~humor~~ *humour*. This takes some getting used to, but they genuinely don't mean to offend. Or so I've been told.

I'm *guessing* that most people over here would primarily perceive you as American the moment you opened your mouth, which comes with its own bag of stereotypes.

There's also that whole large city/small town difference.

I think it would be best to look for Asian Americans who have lived (not just visited) potential target countries, and ask them what their experience has been. An AskReddit about Asian Americans in European countries might be a good idea.

And of course, travel if you can! Nothing beats personal experience. Hmm… They're ""competition"", but AFAIK as an American you can get a Working Holiday visa for Australia and New Zealand, probably Canada and the UK as well, which you could use as a ""try before you buy"" kind of ticket.

"c1xdkhb","&gt; Who do we see? It's not just this easy thing to go to a shrink and be like ""oh yeah hi I'm a pedo, can u fix me?"" It's deeply personal, embarassing and often the pedo bitterly hates themselves for being a pedo!

As far as I know, it is the business of a psychoanalyst to work this out with you if you consider that your sexual fantasies make you unhappy. The trick, of course, is the find the right professional that can handle it and work it out right. As in any profession, half of these people are just very average.

Why you should work it out: apparently, your life is going reasonably well (I don't know how old you are but I would say from late-20's to mid-30's). The trouble is that life sometimes takes very dark turns: terrible divorce/separation, tough unemployment/financial situations, illness, persons you're close to dying, etc. Depression hits at some point (one adult out of 5?). That is when you'll be vulnerable. Some 10 year old will be enamored, you'll have had a couple of shots of whisky too many and then what? What if you cross the line? The consequences will be as disastrous for you and they will be for your victim.

Essentially, get yourself out of potential danger. Lots of people are not pedophiles, they just rape adult women/men, beat the shit out of their wifes and kill without intending to, etc. Any urge that can have disastrous consequences should be carefully examined  so as to remove the potential for danger.

Overall, I compare those type of urges to those sort of more mundane situations: if you got kids, you don't have one of those dangerous dogs at your house (pitbulls, etc). Yes, the dog is nice and friendly. But the day the dog changes his mind and bites, you'll regret not having gotten a French poodle, or whatever. If you're a louzy driver, you don't drive a truck at full speed, maybe you should consider not driving at all, etc...

I personally do not think that being a pedo of the type you describe yourself as is something that cannot be helped. I think it is some quirk in the maturation process that cannot handle something about adult life and/or cannot put into its proper place ""the child in me"". I don't think much of adult life (most people turn this into a pretty horribly boring business) but I strongly believe there is a world of difference between adults and children, and its most uncompromising difference is that adults are responsible for children's safety.

That was my two cents.

"c1x95fy","urban dictionary has a good definition of street smarts: 

&gt;Intelligence gained outside of school. Just as useful as book smarts, and in many cases more so. It can be divided into 4 categories.

&gt;1.Getting Along With Others- Knowing which questions to ask and not asking too many, being polite and friendly, but also being assertive.

&gt;2.Common Sense- Knowing who you can trust, which areas in town are good and which are bad, etc.

&gt;3.Self-defense-Knowing how to fight and fend off an attacker, especially if you are small.

&gt;4.BS-detection-Knowing when people are trying to fuck you over, reading their intentions, and knowing that most corporate advertisements are complete bullshit.

A specific example of street smarts is to ignore vagrants who ask for money. Why? Because (a) it's your damn money and they didn't earn it (b) if they're an addict you're supporting their habit (c) they might be earning lots of money by playing on sympathies and (d) worst case scenario one vagrant will get in your face and ask for money while his partner sneaks up on you from behind and mugs you.

"c1x4v27","I worked at a Tim Horton's for 9 months. It was a love/hate relationship. I loved my initial co-workers, loved the customers because I like talking to people and people liked how I was always cheery and friendly, but I hated the management because they were greedy, annoying, and didn't care about customer satisfaction. 
Anyways, I'm working closing one day alone, it's like 9:45 pm and this regular drives into drive-thru. She asks for her usual, one large 3 cream, 4 sugar; triple triple, and a small chocolate milk (it's been 7 months since I worked there, I'm amazed I remember her order xD) . I say okay, total it and go to get all the stuff. The song that's playing on the radio is [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2Fnet0y9Ts), but it's quiet so the drive-thru or front won't hear it. I do the order up until I get to the chocolate milk. It was a friday night so we were all out because the orders came in on saturday afternoon, so I walk over to the drive thru window, sorta in robot mode, and say ""I'm really sorry, we're all out of porn.""

The awkward pause lasted about two seconds in reality but probably an hour in my head.

Like cpcallen said, you're not even talking about the friend-zone. You're talking about just befriending a girl instead of escalating. Actually, I'm not even too sure of what you're talking about, and I don't think it's based on much real-world experience. I can't get laid in *any* situation by simply befriending a girl and not going beyond that.

You seem to be assuming that PUAs don't have ""friendly"" conversations with girls. When I'm talking to a girl, I like to tease her, and joke around with her. I usually share some stories and have her share her own (unless I'm in an environment where that's a distraction and a liability). Pretty much everything I do is playful and friendly, but instead of going through this whole process where you wait days or weeks to actually make a move, I shorten it to a few hours by building a lot of attraction and escalating.

The friendship is already there because I treat the girl like a friend- except it's also sexual. And you're dead wrong about physical exchanges not elevating a relationship to a deeper level. You must've not had too many physical exchanges in the first place, or else you're approaching them with some sort of weird, asocial mindset.

"c1tkhvr","I'm not saying that I believe human psychology is too complex for objectification to exist. I'm saying that if we use *your* very narrow definition of what constitutes objectification, it would be impossible for objectification to exist, because human motivation for any given action is far to complex to capture in one sentence.


A better definition would be to say that objectification occurs when someone's primary motivation is, in the vast majority, towards one aspect of a person, whether that aspect be sexual or otherwise. For instance, if I have a rich friend who owns a pool, and I perpetuate my friendship with him primarily in order to secure usage of his pool, I have objectified him.


I would go on to say that objectification occurs all the time in everyone's life every day, and is, in fact, an inescapable and frequently healthy part of human psychology. When I go to Starbucks to buy a cup of coffee, I do not give two shits about the fears, dreams, and hopes of the barista who takes my order. I am polite and friendly, but my primary purpose in having a relationship (however superficial and short) with this person is in order to secure coffee in exchange for legal tender.


So we are forced to acknowledge that objectification often occurs in a healthy manner and is necessary for the function of society. What, then, are we talking about when we talk about the objectification of other human beings for sexual purposes being so pernicious and harmful?


We're talking about people having low emotional IQ, or having poor social skills, or being manipulative, or being mean, or being insensitive to appropriate boundaries. We're talking, not about objectification, but about people being *assholes*. The two things may occur simultaneously, and they may be linked within any given event.

"c1sokxt","Already been said, but the first thing that springs to mind is the friendliness on an individual level.  This was at least true for the midwest.

I was blown away when I met my partner's family for the first time; they treated me as family despite being a complete stranger to them and I felt completely accepted.  This was even true of complete strangers though, they'd greet me or compliment what I was wearing completely unexpectedly when I was just out and about doing boring things like grocery shopping.  It felt a little odd, to be honest; where I live if strangers start talking to you they're usually asking for something, mentally ill, have an alterior motive or some combination of all three.  Whether this is just because I went from very large city to smaller town mid-west or it's the people, I haven't quite worked out.  I will be the first to admit I have some anti-american leanings, but on an individual level by far most Americans have always been not only friendly but also interested in my perspective as a foreigner.  This friendliness has also been extended to the internet, I have many people online who are American who I consider to be good friends.

I think Americans also have a curiosity and idealism I find often quite refreshing.  They might never actually agree with you, but seem genuinely interested in your perspective.  And it may not work out a lot of the time, but the idealism and positivity regardless of current situation is still a good trait in my opinion.

Waffles, and most of the breakfast assortment.  And the 24 hour diners that serve them.  I feel we need more of that here.

The Bill of Rights is a good thing.  Even if it's not always used the way it should, I come from somewhere which doesn't explicitly have freedom of speech.  I don't feel restricted by that, but I do think it's something every country should have and reflect on when making decisions.

I enjoy the customer service in restaurants.  I like even better when I'm nice to the waitstaff and they seem shocked out of their skin to be treated like a person.  That was admittedly a bit of a back-handed compliment.

There are many things that have come out of America that I enjoy as well, but that's not really something ""About americans"".

"c1skf32","These advices are already very good.

I just came back from a 4 weeks in europe. As he mentioned, i too booked my next hostels always over the internet from the hostel i was currently staying in. Going without a booking in the summertime can be a bit naive as the hostels will be very crowded? and packed, so maybe you have a hard time finding a free bed. 
As for booking websites i recommend www.hostelworld.com and www.hostelbookers.com .

Also i cant recommend the railpass. On the positive side you will see lots of landscape but on the negative side, its pretty timewasting. I took flights from city/country to city/country. As for price comparison i can recommend www.swoodoo.com  but i think its only in german.
For other negative aspects of train taking see Aqwis comment.

English is widely spoken in europe and in 95% the hostelstaff speaks and understands english very well.

Packaging:
Take 2 backpacks. 1 small for your daily trips and 1 big one (70 liters) for all your clothes etc.
Bring a padlock with you. Often hostels have a small personal cabin where you can lock you stuff in while you are on your daily trip.
Sleep in mixed dorms(if you have no problems with that). This saves you some money even more than a pure male /female dorm. 
Pack light. 
Bring garbage sack with you where you can stuff your used clothes in and seperate it from your fresh clothes. Pack a small first aid kit in for small injuries like cuts etc.
Wear jeans. You can wear them very long. They dont get dirty so fast and are comfortable. 
Bring a travel adapter with you for you electronic devices. Its hard to find an adapter for the specific land your currently in then. 

Safety:
NEVER have your wallet in your asspocket of your jeans or in your backpack. I can't believe how many tourists i met that had theirs in there. These are the first spots a pickpocketer checks when hes robbing you. Put it in a fanny bag or in a bag around your neck. (sorry dont know the right word for that).
You will stand often in crowded places and long lines. Always have some bottled water with you and your backpack wearing in front not on your back in crowded areas.  
You will see (and meet) a lot of ""african"" people that want to sell you sunglases beautiful sunglases!^^ Don't say a word. Don't look at them. Don't stop. Just keep walking pass them and/or ignore them.
People all over the world are in generally normal people living their life and are nice and friendly. But remember they recognise you immediatly as a tourist. Don't fall for scams. 

Money:
When you own a credit card, make sure you call your credit card institute and tell them that you are going on travel in europe. Most institutes block for security reason your card when its used abroad.
Always have some cash on you. Not to much. Around  150€ and you are independet for a few days. 
When visiting cultural sites and museums of anything else, always try the "" I am a student"" trick. You often get discounts. (not in hostels of course)
Europe uses the € (Euro). Exchange money BEFORE you go on travel. When you are using the exchange offices in the land, they often have shittier rates.

This and that:
Traveling alone is independent and fun. But of course experiencing sites together is more fun. In hostels you will meet a lot of backpackers and alone travellers. Dont hesitate to just walk straight up to them and asking for their name and where they are from. From there on a normal conversation evolves from itself and you will find maybe company.

 Europe on a Shoestring from Lonely Planet is a good guide for whole europe. Maybe you want to buy that.

And last but not least. Have fun and be open minded and you will have a great experience.


Thats it. If you got any more questions let me know.

"c1seg6h","Based on my knowledge of the breed, Goldens love to play, play, play with other dogs. Try to get a dog that would love to play with him back! Goldens tend to be nosy and pretty ""in your face"" so you should definitely think about having them meet before hand. There is a chance that the dog you end up liking, will not end up liking your Golden. 

It all really depends on your Goldens temperament though. I've met Goldens that spend all their time laying around, being lazy, and I've met Goldens that want nothing to do but to be loved and petted and played with, and they can sometimes be very forward about it, with a lot of tail wagging and butt wiggling and a lot of slobbery kisses.

The temperament is important because your dog can either end up annoying a more independent dog, or a more playful dog could end up annoying your Golden. Making sure they get along is important. 

Breeds to stay away from (in my opinion) would be: Shibas, Basenjis, Poodles, most terriers (especially Bull Terriers, in my opinion) and Corgis. Any dog that would have a Napoleon Complex with your Golden, especially if you want to go smaller. Some breeds are intimidated by bigger dogs because they have dominate, big personalities, and this can lead to aggression and hubris, which you generally want to avoid. Some breeds are just better in one-dog households. 

I think a good bet, if you're going to adopt, is to look for a something that kind of looks like shepherd/lab/beagle. Those dogs tend to be very friendly, but also very lazy and passive. They are usually on the medium side of growth because Beagles tend to be small, but adopt an older dog so you know they're full grown if you're really worried. Or try to see if you can find an Australian Labradoodle (basically a mini labradoodle) up for adoption, because they tend to be extremely friendly and happy. 

The thing is, unless your dog is aggressive, or the dog you end up adopting shows aggression, your pups will probably end up getting along. Breeds don't necessarily matter, but I just listed a few, that in my opinion, have short patience windows and may not like being in a house with a bigger dog. The only thing that truly matters is the temperament of the dog, and that can vary based on how it was raised and trained. Before adopting a dog you like, bring your Golden along to have a nice play session and see how it goes from there.

"c1qqgkv","SoC feels longer and more open. The overall setup of CoP is much more friendly, but limited. CoP has quest hubs with plenty of side quests and things to do, and artifact hunting is a legitimate way to make money- unmodded SoC is... different, in that regard. SoC has faction bases that you can raid and destroy-CoP has sides you can be friends with but not remove. With the complete mods for either game they get better (but the complete mod for CoP made me crash going into the second area :( ).

Without giving anything away, SoC's endings are okay. Not everyone likes them. CoP does the Fallout 3 style ending of ""here's what happened during your play and how it affected the future of the game"".

I'd recommend both, with SoC only if you can only get one. I liked playing through both of them, in order.

"c1n71ov","Congratulations! I can't give advice from the design perspective, but I can give advice from the business side; I've worked on exploratory committees checking out design for businesses before. 

This first meeting is just exploration. They'll be trying to see if your design fits their business needs, and also seeing what it's like to work with you. You should do the same to them. It's good to be nice and friendly, but above all else be reasonably grounded. If they ask questions you've already presented publicly, answer them! If they start asking questions that isn't public and makes you uncomfortable, it's okay to be hesitant. It's always okay to ask for 24 or 48 hours before making any decision too (remember the phrase: ""This sounds very exciting. Can I let you know in the next two days?"").

Figure out your best outcome. If you own a patent on this, are you ready to start a business and take it to market? My guess is no. If you're best option is to sell this to them, don't break their balls so much that they walk away. It's your first commercial design, so even if they offer a bit less than you want, it's probably still better than nothing.

Everyone telling you to lawyer up and start filing patents right now is wrong. Doing that signals you aren't really willing to work together. If you do this to a Fortune 500 company, they'll just take your idea. A company with 7m in revenue is actually *very* small, so they'll most likely just walk away if they get a bad vibe. And not to slam the thread, but designers typically have a terrible idea of how much an idea will make for a business. I can't tell you the number of times a designer told us his idea would save millions, when after we included all the things we'd have to spend money on to get to that point, it was a money pit. 

To me, the real value for you isn't the money of the sale. The biggest value is in being a student with a commercially bought design on your resume.

"c1n5dji","Wow dude you have no idea what you are talking about.  I have lived in PA my entire life and the past 4 years have been spent in Philly, often in what many people would consider the ghetto.  Almost everything you are saying is either bullshit or not at all common.  

No one told them Philly segregation was over?  I can't fucking believe people are upvoting this shit.  I mean I know it is in line with a lot of people's preconceived notions but I thought this subreddit was for intelligent discussion, not bullshit generalizations by someone who has never even lived here.

To your first point, I live very near UPenn currently and there was a ""black"" bar very close to my house until just recently.  First of all, that has nothing to do with racism, it's a demographic difference.  Yes there are bars for the ""locals"" and there are ""college"" bars.  Technically obviously anyone can go into any bar but it makes sense to go to a bar with people who are similar to you.  Why would some older local to Philly want to go to a bar surrounded by a bunch of drunk, rich and often annoying college kids?  They wouldn't so they go to other bars that have more people like them.  The ""segregation"" happens naturally and it's based on preference, common interests, and partially income.  Not race. 

 If you went into a local bar(as I did to buy beer when I didn't feel like walking farther) as a white college kid, yea you might get some looks because you are going to be out of place.  No one is going to discriminate against you and I'm sure if you struck up a conversation with someone they wouldn't treat you differently.  And those streets that were filled with white people?  Yea you were in university city, where 2 big universities are blocks away from each other that are overwhelmingly white(though they do have a very high percentage of Indians and Asians compared to the demographics of the rest of the city).  What you didn't realize was that there are tons of local people who are primarily black living around the area.  So they have their own bars that the college kids tend to avoid.  I guarantee you any black kids from the universities wouldn't want to go hang out in those bars either.  In fact, I know that because I have several black friends who do go to university and I know they wouldn't want to.  

That black girl you talked to was full of shit.  It is absolutely not uncomfortable for a minority to live in new york than ""anywhere in PA"".  God that sentence makes me so angry, I can't believe you can think that.  I grew up partially in part of hickville pa then moved when I was young to a mid sized city about an hour away from Philly.  It had plenty of minorities and racism was never a problem.  Of course there were some people who were racist but nothing really happened openly.  Actually, if anything it was the other way around(in that the racism was against the white people whom I assume you consider to be the majority even when in Philly the majority are black).  My mother was spit at once while walking our dogs through south-side(which has a higher percentage of Hispanic people and is generally poorer) before she knew it wasn't the best of areas.

People in general around here are actually very friendly, minorities and majorities included.  There are a few assholes but overall people are friendly.  People hold the door for other people, say thank you and are polite in general.  I take public transportation nearly every day here so I see a lot of interaction between people of much different backgrounds, ethnicities and ""classes"".  They are nearly always friendly and normal, there is definitely no segregation or racism that occurs even remotely near often.   Black, white, asian, hispanic whatever you can think of they all sit next to each other on buses, subways and trolleys, they hold doors for each other, walk next to each other and are friends with each other.  I mean it's not like the places is a utopia where everyone is always friendly but overall that's how people are.

- know your product and/or service more than anything the customer could ever find out about, and know the answers to any possible question they could ask. Giving them answers they want makes them feel secure, raising the probably they'll go with you.
- be casual and friendly, but still assertive. Don't push the product to where you seem annoying. Find ways to indirectly scoot around your goal (a recruitment) by giving details to make them feel secure, and that'll usually bring them around.

"c1kdkv9","I am going to disagree, as much as I suspect it will be an unpopular thing to do. 

The name of the game here is civility. You are put unfairly in a situation where you need to rely on these people for insurance. It is unfair because I am going to take your word on the fact that Sugar is the devil incarnate. But right now you need her and him for something really important (your health) and while you can't see it now, you're going to need your dad for something really important down the line....he isn't going to live forever, and no matter how horrible his wife is I think there's still a good piece of love between you and your father. If you let the monster step mom become a dividing force, you're going to look back and kick yourself for wasting the time you had with your dad, and I am worried about that. 

I am not much older than you, so this is not an argument of ""those kids today"" proportions, but you are really, really young. You're only four years removed from the drama and the pain of having to live with that wretch. So of course, I don't expect you're in a place right this minute to let bygones be bygones, but I think that's a place you need to be working towards. That doesn't mean you have to be nice, or even like her, but I know that you have it in you to be in a room with her and maintain the common decency standards. You may feel like that's not something you can do now and I get that, but someday you're going to have to move on. 

Now, you say you made an attempt at this and she meddled.....and that's why I am kind of calling your bluff here. What kind of situation did you set yourself up for? If you're doing this correctly, I don't see a way that she could possibly meddle. You're at a place where you can control and restrict the way your dad (and by proxy, Sugar) participates in your life in such as way as she has no room to meddle; no ammo to throw at you. But, once again, you're only four years away from the pain so I don't know that you have the distance you need to construct that relationship, but I have no doubt that you can eventually. 

This is coming out in shambles, but what I am trying to say is that right now you're in pain about the past and it is clouding the long view of the situation. She's a bad person, but your dad loves her and unless something catastrophic happens she's always going to be in his life. That means at SOME point you I think you can come up with an arsenal of tactics to be able to be around her and brush off the hateful/obnoxious parts of her personality. But those are skills that tend to come later in life, and they tend to come when you give yourself enough time and space to really put perspective between you and the trauma of the past. 

With regards to the wedding, it sounds like you're in a place right now where it means more to you to not have Sugar there than it does to have your father be present. I'd consider that carefully, but if that's the conclusion you come to then try to invite him (and exclude her) in the most gracious way you can. He (as you predict) may very well choose his girlfriend, but you can't help that. It's your day, so you have to do what's best for you. 

**Tl;dr: No, there probably isn't a way to have a relationship with just your dad. No, you shouldn't feel bad about your feelings regarding Sugar, and you should definitely take the time you need to put as much space and perspective you can between you and her. But you only have one dad and if you love him, try to work towards getting to a place where you can be civil to Sugar: not nice, not friendly, but civil. If you can do that, you might be able to salvage a relationship with your father without letting Sugar's demons into your life. **",1299883066,"but you only have one dad and if you love him, try to work towards getting to a place where you can be civil to sugar: not nice, not friendly, but civil.","friendly, but civil","friendly","but",TRUE,"friendly , but civil","civil",NA,NA,1

*He is smart and thoughtful.

*He is funny and has a unique perspective on life.

*He is kind and friendly, but a little reserved.

*He is strong, mature and secure in his masculinity without acting the slightest bit macho or disparaging to women. 

*He knows what he wants to do with his life and he is passionate about reaching his goals, yet he's always finding interesting new hobbies and side projects.

*He treats me with love and respect. He never talks me down in front of his friends or tries to make me feel bad about myself. Because of this, I ask for his opinions and constructive criticisms, since I know they will be coming from a good place. 

*He supports me in my own goals for my career and my education and shows real interest in my work (instead of flowers, he brings home library books related to my research interests).

*He helps me when I need help and asks for my help when he needs it. 

*He is honest and trustworthy. He's never given me a reason to doubt what he says. Working late = Working late. 

Of course, nobody is actually perfect. And some people might not like being married to someone I find perfect. But the above is a list of all the reasons why I think my husband is the best man on earth. Any man who is a good human being and true to his personality will be perfect for somebody.

"c1h7fjn","I had a similar thing happen with an airline a little over a year ago.  I checked in for the flight online and indicated that I would like to check one bag.  I entered my credit card to pay the extra charge for the checked bag.  When my transaction was finalized, it showed that I had 11 bags to check and the total charge to my credit card was &lt; $1000.  There was no way to modify this and checked bag fees were non-refundable.

I immediately called customer service to get this cleared up and was bounced around until I finally ended up at the online services department.  I spoke with someone who assured me that they would reverse the charge on the card.

A few weeks later I get my CC bill and check to make sure that the charge had been credited.  It turns out that I had been given the credit, but the initial charge had never gotten through, so I now have a ~$1100 credit to the balance on my CC account.

In next months statement there was no charge either, so I called customer service to get everything straightened.  The first person I talked to had never dealt with this issue before and I kept having to repeat the situation, until I finally put it as simply as I could... ""Your company gave me money that is not mine and I want to give it back.""  He then transferred me to the billing department where I had to repeat my situation several times before it finally sunk in.  The woman was very friendly, but unsure of the procedure for something of this nature and would have to consult her supervisor.  Since it was Friday afternoon and the manager was not around, they would have to call me back on Monday.  I gave her all of my contact information including my CC number.

It has been over a year and have never heard anything back from anyone, nor has the charge ever been put on my CC.

I don't feel any remorse for the extra $1100 payment on my credit card.  I made the company fully aware of the mistake and did my due diligence in trying to get it corrected.  I think I would have felt bad keeping the money had I not let the company know.

"c1fl5o1","I lived in Korea for 10 years - pretty much grew up in Seoul but went to an American school so I can tell you a little about the expat experience. Totally subjective of course. :D

1. FOOD: Local food is incredibly cheap, but imported or out of season food is really expensive. You can end up paying like 14 bucks for a carton of blueberries if they're not in season, but like $1 for a watermelon at the right time. I don't know if this affects you since I guess you'll be able to use the PX. Lucky. I would always get my army brat friends to buy me cheetos and campbell's soup. Always shop at smaller markets - never buy food at department stores - the markups are INSANE. Korean food isn't as nuanced as thai or chinese - it's a simpler cuisine and doesn't use complex spices. If you're going to live there and eat local, you better LOVE chili paste (gochujjang), charred meat, and all things fermented. 

2. SHOPPING FOR OTHER STUFF: If you and your wife like shopping for knickknacks and jewelry and knockoff clothes and stationary and accessories you will be in heaven because you can wander shopping districts for hours while spending very little.

3. NIGHTLIFE: Pretty awesome and varied. There are artsier districts, usually near colleges and they have some crazily decorated / themed bars that look like temples or the insides of mushrooms or an ice wonderland while still being kind of low key. Itaewon is... seedier. I hear it's gotten way better in the last couple of years but when I was there (until 2004) it was still pretty hooker-heavy. It's practically inside Yongsan base. There are also really classy hoods on the other side of the river with things like a Mr. Chow's. Beer by the pitcher is the way to go. Public drunkenness is incredibly commonplace. You can smoke pretty much anywhere - restaurants, cafes, etc, and nobody complains. If you really don't like smoke, you might not like being at many of the bars and restaurants there.

4. INTEGRATING: You mention that you're interested in submerging in a culture, but that's actually surprisingly difficult to do in Korea. There's a pretty strong expat bubble and whatever their intentions, I've usually seen that foreigners end up pretty much hanging out with each other with a few Koreans thrown into the mix. It's kind of hard to explain, but Koreans are really friendly but at the same time quite insular. You're Korean, or you're a foreigner, and there is an invisible barrier that takes a lot of work to get through. If you are in military dress, it will be even harder because military dudes haven't built up a very positive reputation for themselves in the local imagination. The flip side of this is that there's a lot that foreigners tend to get away with - police don't tend to bother you.

5. RECREATION: There are gorgeous mountains to climb with multiple paths, and streams, and drinking springs that come out of rocks, and some of them are right in the middle of Seoul. Most of the nature on the mountains is protected, so there are these awesome green islands of green filled with flowers and pheasants and hilarious elderly people in matching track suits performing calisthenics and yodeling and then you can walk back down and be right in the middle of the city again. You can go outside the city to theme parks and ski slopes with cabins to rent. There are many ""Korean Culture"" themed places with people in traditional dress doing traditional things for the benefit of tourists. Lots of golf. Some parts of Rural Korea are stunning, and definitely warrant a drive - rocky strange beaches, the mist-covered flatlands that flood in summer and are dry in winter (on the way to Incheon), temples. The War museum is worth a visit. And definitely go see the displayed pig heads and edible silkworm cocoons in Namdaemun - they're neat. You can also buy fireworks to shoot out over the Han river!

6. CULTURE: If you're really hoping to immerse yourself in a different culture, I would suggest picking a base outside of Seoul. Seoul is quite cosmopolitan and modern, and people there are very used to foreigners. But again, you're going to be living on a base so you might not be interacting with people as regularly as you hope. It's worth noting that much of Korea's cultural legacy was destroyed during the war and various invasions so there's not quite as much immediately visible persistent culture as you migh find in Beijing or Kyoto.

7. NORTH KOREA &amp; POLITICS: Since you mentioned it. Many people want reunification - families (including mine) still have living relatives there who they haven't seen in decades. As for the threat, I would say that for the most part we never thought about it until there would be an incident, and even then nobody gets seriously worried. People are pretty desensitized to the idea of a threat from the north. I would describe Korean politics as cheerfully corrupt.

In sum, I would honestly say that Korea's a great place to go as a starter for living overseas. The people are quite a bit more friendly and open and the prices are WAY cheaper than those in Japan, and Seoul is less aggressively chaotic and confusing than the bigger cities in China, but it's a short flight (like going to another state) to see either if you live in Korea. You might however find it lacking if you're looking for a classically Asian experience with... I don't know... spice markets and silk merchants and dragons on everything.

Also: Traffic. Everywhere. FOREVER. But the subway in Seoul is pretty great and easy even though it looks like the freaking [flying spaghetti monster](http://bibs.snu.ac.kr/sage/seoul_subway_e.jpg). If you do end up going, PM me and I'll tell you how to get into the pretty secret (hardly ever see anyone else there) pristine forest behind my old house right in the middle of Seoul.

It took far too long for the US to realize that Communism was not really the threat it was made out to be, other than that whole 'atomic weapons' thing. I mean that it was 'common knowledge' in the '50s that all socialist states were exactly the same system and all took direct orders from Moscow.

This despite the very public split between USSR and China, the split between USSR and Tito's Yugoslavia, and the stubborn independence of Albania. It was assumed that if a communist state were established in Vietnam, it would start a cascade effect that could only end with all of Asia being under direct control of the Kremlin.

In other words, the US assumed that *political ideology* trumped all other factors. Meaning that, for example, a communist Vietnam would be closely allied to communist China, and that their common system of government would suddenly cancel out cultural and philosophical differences that are centuries old.

Although it is an entirely different entity, and entirely different circumstances, I think the US is making the same mistake today in regards to 'Islamism'. The notion that any 'Islamic' group anywhere in the world is just like the Taliban, is as stubbornly ignorant as the Taliban itself. Yet that's how the US thinks. 

If it were otherwise, why is there still an embargo on Cuba? (The answer to that, in a nutshell, is that the Dole family still want their plantations back. They're not going to get them.)

My point, rambling though it is, is that I wish the US would exercise more in the way of public support for democratic movements, or more tacit pressure on repressive regimes, even at the cost of alienating friendly but profoundly undemocratic governments. Yes, Saudi Arabia (and Israel). I'm looking at you ...

I would follow it up with ""So, I have some notes i'll refer to from time to time to make sure i'm answering your questions to the best of my ability"". Then make sure you bring a list of notes that are TYPED OUT neatly.

When preping for an interview you should also type up some questions to ask them. Type them up and keep them in a padfolio. Take notes while they are talking. Write down additional questions you have about what they are saying so they don't fly out of your head (this always happens to me). 

this might seem over the top and really anal but companies love it. It shows you've prepared for interview and have researched their company. Also, with a job interview you're interviewing them as much as they are interviewing you. Not every job is the right fit so you owe it to yourself to find out more about the place and the position.

Everyone here is saying to practice and that's good advice. sit down with a friend and have them ask you questions. answer the questions over and over in your head when your at home or driving around. Just keep talking it over to yourself so that it's almost memorized.

"c1aovo4","&gt;It astonishes me how you've somehow read into my arguments that I believe Christian morality should be imposed on others (I don't)

I know, and that only furthers my opinion that your stance is contradictory. You seem to advocate absolute morality, yet you claim you don't want to impose this morality on others. Well, then, what point is there to absolute morality, if it isn't _absolute_?

I'm arguing your logical extreme, just like you were previously arguing mine, and perhaps you have some way of explaining how to reconcile absolute morality with the freedom to disregard said morality, but until then, I stand by what I said.

&gt;Amorality is a perfectly valid choice in a relative world. Nature will not raise its hand against the genocidal tyrant, and if no strength of men can overthrow him he will destroy all he deems unworthy of life.

Absolutely right. And isn't that _exactly_ what we've seen happen, time and time again? We've wiped out both parts of nature, and parts of ourselves, during our short history on earth. Viruses have wiped out other large parts of life on this planet. Animals prey on other animals completely devoid of any respect for some greater, absolute morality, and we are as included in this group as any other species.

There is _no reason_ to suppose an absolute morality, except for the case of the Christian that already presupposes the existence of God, and therefor _must_ accept the belief that he is the absolute moral judge.

As a side note, I'm seeing a problem similar to those Christian creationists that can't figure out how evolution is supposed to work. See, evolution doesn't work on single individuals, nor on all of a species at once. One species will not ""replace"" another directly, nor will an ape one day don a suit and top hat, and start singing show tunes. Evolution works on societies, on isolated groups of individuals that share genes with each other. Morality is, in many ways, _just_ like evolution. It evolves, not in magical leaps, but in small steps, and it does so among isolated groups of individuals, not among the whole species at once, nor with a single individual.

No creature can ""cast aside"" evolution any more than we, as sentient beings, can ""cast side"" morality. We can try, but we will inevitably fail. Even if we succeed in ourselves, the morality of others will suppress our own. Morality _must_ evolve on a societal level, just like natural selection.

&gt;In the face of a species superior in every facet to us, save our view of morality, how can we argue our annihilation is wrong? From an ""enlightened"" perspective, we may propose that all sentient life is worthy of life, but this is merely one viewpoint among many in a relative, or nonexistent moral universe.

True. And thinking about it, isn't your alien race behaving exactly like the human race are right now? We wipe out entire species right and left without barely an afterthought. We see ourselves as both technically and morally superior to anyone and everything else. We are the masters of this planet, and the universe, only because we have nothing else to compare ourselves to.

I honestly don't see the point in the example you're making. Why would we be any more special than they are? Why would we suddenly argue that we deserve life, when we've decided that so many other species didn't? My own, personal _hope_ is, of course, that any alien races that bother to visit us are benevolent and friendly, but who am I to condemn an alien race that isn't? Who are you?

&gt;Besides, I'm certain all universal moral truths can be summed up in two phrases (of which the first is anathema for most): love God, and love your neighbor as yourself.

Yes, that is the Christian claim and belief, and here's why I think it's wrong (in the ""it has to be absolute"" sense):

""Love God"". Obviously, this can be ignored, as we haven't even established that God exists. Do that, and we can get back to this one.

""Love your neighbor as yourself"". Sure, this is great, in the short term. If everyone gets along, everyone's happy, right? Perhaps. Or perhaps our suddenly onset of moral thinking causes us to stop the natural cycle of self-sanitation that ultimately leads to humanity over-populating our planet, and thus killing both ourselves and any number of other species by exhaustion of resources. We're at the top of the food chain, and that _is_ a real and present problem. We have no threats, save for ourselves, and previously we have been decent enough to keep our numbers somewhat in check by way of wars (many of which were, of course, fought for moral reasons and with moral superiority by both sides simultaneously).

What I'm saying is that ""love thy neighbor"" is great as a relative moral law, in that it reduces friction in societies. It's useless in an absolute, global and universal context, because it would essentially make progress stop entirely, and result in the death of everything we know in a much shorter time span. You may think I'm just being cynical, and you're, of course, welcome to present a countering argument.

&gt;The rest that you argue against really is relative (homosexuality, death penalty, etc.) because it is nearly impossible to separate the social and cultural mores related to those controversies, leaving us unable to ascertain an absolutely certainty.

Such bullshit. If there _is_ an absolute morality, and God is at the center of it, then it's pretty clear that God has absolutely no problem whatsoever with capital punishment, and thinks homosexuality is an abomination. Otherwise, if we assume that those parts of the Bible are simply the works of flawed men, meant to be read in the context of _their_ society, then what's to stop _all_ of the Bible to be read this way? Why does ""love thy neighbor"" have to be any more true today than ""death to homosexuals""? Because _your_ relative morality says so?

&gt;In such a case, it is better to interpret them in a relative manner than to advocate a universal position that may end up being incorrect.

Basically, my entire argument is about the fact that you _cannot_ present to me even one, single example of a universally absolute moral law. There is no evidence for anything like it, and it doesn't become more true just because it's an integral part of your religion and your beliefs. Relative morality is what we have, and what we've always had, without exception.

"c197870","&gt; delusions of grandeur

It's hyperbole.  I've explained myself several times and you didn't quite get it, so my apologies if I overcooked it this time.

This is what foreign tourists have told me: they don't come to the US for the fastest trains or the best food - Europe is more civilized and Asia is more exciting.  **They don't come to the US to be wooed.**  They come to the US for *the spectacle*.  I suppose we could ignore that and try to have tulip festivals, but it seems to me a fool's errand.

&gt; Look how the UK uses its royal family for tourism.

I'm sorry, but I've never bought this.  Tourists go to see buildings, not people.  There haven't been royals at Versailles for centuries, but France still manages to cash in on its history.

Your other examples are charming, but fail to address the problem of scale.  The entire Netherlands could fit within most US states, so choosing to brand ourselves after a regional niche like tulips is not a reasonable national tourism strategy.  Nor *should we* try the same kinds of gimmicks as small countries.  As I said earlier, people don't come to the US to be charmed.   

&gt; We've got tons of stuff to sell but we're not doing it... we've forgotten how to woo other people.

"c18r2be","Christian, Catholic here. I should say that, first of all, the group you belong to seems to be part of a little bubble, and is not terribly representative of Christianity as a whole. You say:

&gt;Every time I challenge an accepted belief I am shot down as someone with no faith and no morals even when I explain that I simply want to match what I (or others) have observed to our faith.

This certainly isn't true of the circles I run in, where ""Jesus Christ, nice guy w/some kind of special access to the divine"" is about as orthodox as your faith needs to be. There are many, many denominations in the US that accept this sort of basically skeptical outlook, that essentially ask for nothing more than for you to be open to the presence of Christ.

And that brings me to a second point. One way of looking at Christianity - a way that many people on the outside tend to adopt - is that it's basically a bookish religion where you go, read the holy books, form your dogma, pray a little bit and try to seek Jesus, and then maybe, maybe, adjust your dogma a bit after that, reluctantly. Another way of looking at it, though, is as a religion where mystical experience comes first. This harkens back to the very earliest days of Christianity, where Christ was thought of as Christ the magician and his name sprinkled liberally over the spells and magical rites of pagans found in places like the Greek Magical Papyri. 

Now, we would they do that? They weren't Christians; it follows that, as magicians, they simply found from experience that invoking his name was rather useful. In this view, Christ is ultimately a mysterious figure; we should start with we know about him, at the most basic level - basically, if you pray and seek spiritual assistance and invoke the name of Christ, he ultimately responds in the manner of a friendly but powerful 'spirit' who will assist you in your pursuits. Note that the theology, history, textual analysis etc. are all very secondary here - the point is that if you seek Christ, some kind of Christ-like presence will answer and bring light into your life. Since you don't believe in the dogma anymore (truth be told, many other people don't either), trying to come to Christianity from this direction - as a sort of 'tried-and-true' empirically based religion, essentially - might help.",1292137039,"in this view, christ is ultimately a mysterious figure; we should start with we know about him, at the most basic level - basically, if you pray and seek spiritual assistance and invoke the name of christ, he ultimately responds in the manner of a friendly but powerful 'spirit' who will assist you in your pursuits.","friendly but powerful","friendly","but",FALSE,"friendly but powerful","powerful",NA,NA,1
"c18oh0g","Comparing and Contrasting MGMT's Congratulations and Oracular Spectacular:

The first album, Oracular Spectacular is basically an amazing set of songs.  They're all a nice mix of fun, hip, dance-friendly but slightly weird.  The band had a sound, certainly but there was nothing really tying the album together.  But that's fine, the singles are great, and most people would probably prefer to just listen to Kids or Electric Feel than to sit through the whole album.

Congratulations is a no singles kind of album.  Clearly the band did this on purpose, and they're not the first ones to follow up an OK Computer with a Kid A.  That doesn't diminish the quality of this purposefully difficult album.  It's more a matter chilling atmosphere, haunting lyrics, with less dance and fun, but still a solid piece of work.  

I saw these guys in Miami about a month ago, and you could see the difference between the way people would jump around and sing along to the familiar songs off of Oracular Spectacular, and the way the audience seemed transfixed when they would play tracks off of Congratulations.

There are still some breakout moments on Congratulations.  Flash Delirium, Brian Eno, and the title track, are still great songs, but this is an album to listen to at home with a good set of headphones and no distractions.  So I'll agree that Oracular Spectacular is a better set of songs, but Congratulations is a much better album.",1292088139,"they're all a nice mix of fun, hip, dance-friendly but slightly weird.","friendly but slightly","friendly","but",FALSE,"friendly but slightly weird","weird",NA,"slightly",1
"c18l29j","My 2 cents: read the rules extensively before starting a campaign, no matter what format. Chances are you'll be the one answering questions or judging disputes, so you should know what you're doing. Of course you could just wing it, which is fine too, but a solid base is always necessary, and in this case even more so.

Second, a helping hand is always good - creating a character from scratch, calculating every stat and so forth can be a bit of a chore. Do explain, however, what is going on (and, if possible, why). Once they get a grip of basic game mechanics they'll be more able to figure stuff out on their own, and you won't need to steer them as much - which saves precious gaming time.

Third, if you are looking for a specific type of campaign (child-friendly, but heavy on the Orcs, it seems), you might want to try your hand at adapting an existing campaign - you can substitute 'cats' with 'orcs', or 'orcs' with 'foul tentacle-demons from the fourth nether-dimension', and so forth. This means you have at least a basic template to work from, but don't have to conform to the basic premise of your chosen setting.

Fourth, and last, although your wee players will need a lot of assistance, try to make sure they're actually playing the game (or, at the very least, let them feel as if they're playing the game). The simple act of letting them roll their own dice might make them feel as if they're in charge of their character (this is partly in response to Kerguidou), but I'd go so far as to say you should just drop some (ham-fisted) hints as to what might be a smart thing to do, and let them figure it out from there.

Oh, and a last suggestion; why not try the Eberron setting? I'm not too experienced with it, but from what I've seen it's incredibly versatile and pretty much fun in general. Of course, this doesn't work if you're getting the Red Box or vanilla D&amp;D.",1292009603,"third, if you are looking for a specific type of campaign (child-friendly, but heavy on the orcs, it seems), you might want to try your hand at adapting an existing campaign - you can substitute 'cats' with 'orcs', or 'orcs' with 'foul tentacle-demons from the fourth nether-dimension', and so forth.","friendly, but heavy","friendly","but",TRUE,"friendly , but heavy","heavy",NA,NA,1

I spent my 20s being quite forward and sexually assertive. My overwhelming experience was that it put men off. I just recently had a guy I used to date casually tell me that when we were together he found me intimidating. He told me this in a conversation where he was apologizing for the way he treated me and essentially trying to get me back into a FWB relationship....  A lot of what he said was flattering, and he was essentially apologizing for not appreciating me when he had me, but if anything it confirmed my suspicions. I feel like most men will say they want a forward woman, someone who is sexually confident, but when presented with one, they will prefer the woman who is not making the advances.

I'm a little embarrassed to admit it, but this year I decided ""fuck it, I'll play your stupid games by your stupid rules"" - I now never ask a guy on a date and I rarely initiate contact.

The Tang dynasty tried to install a puppet gov't in the conquered region which Silla had to drive out.

I never said culturally Korea isn't linked to China.

But we're not talking about cultural relations, the movement of religion or technology, which can cross all sorts of friendly and hostile borders, we're talking about political relations.

Politically speaking, Korea has put a lot of effort to remain independent from China and it will remain to do so. There has been a lot of political mistrust as China has always tried to control Korea while Korea has always fiercely defended its right to remain an independent nation. Off base? Who's the one ignoring centuries of conflicts and political maneuverings by each side to get power? What, these were just romantic teasings between friends? I suggest you understand the POLITICAL history between China and Korea. I'm not saying Korea and China were like the US and USSR, but they weren't ready allies either. There has always been a distrust of each other and while there were various alliances for political reasons, neither has been wholly willing to help the other without some personal gain. Of course Korea, being the smaller country, would have had to make concessions and had a very good reason to maintain a professional relationship with China. I'm not saying they were constantly at each others' throats.

I also never said eventually Korean-Chinese relations won't be stronger than Korean-US, geographically and economically with China being the rising superpower, it's inevitable - with enough time.

"c144uq6","&gt;Lee I would like to let you know that a skin or character (3d modeling + texturing) takes about a single artist about one week or two weeks to complete.

Source?

&gt;The design takes a little longer but that includes plenty of rejected designs, internal and external testing. You over estimate the amount of time and resources that the characters draw from the overall resources of riot. 

Again: source?

&gt;Also you underestimate the effort and time that it takes to create these things you obviously deserve because you are special!

The point isn't that anyone ""deserves"" these features. The point is that these features are needed to make the game competitive. LoL is fun, but it is not a great competitive game.

&gt;All open development companies promise new things yet fail to deliver its not an uncommon thing (for example, Wow still doesn't have multiple dances).

This is a terrible analogy. WoW characters having multiple dances has absolutely no effect on the competitiveness of WoW arenas - they run fine even without these dances. The lack of observer mode in LoL means that people *cannot watch a tournament*, and without a viewership, tournaments mean absolutely nothing. E-Sports in Korea took off when tournaments began to be televised by KeSPA. Until LoL has an observer mode, it *cannot be a competitive game*.

&gt;So I think to summarize my thoughts of your posts (not just from this thread) is that you are a hate spreading disease on the league community, you constantly tell people you are right or you spread words against riot just so you can rage that you dont have voip+replays+what ever else you cry about.

Uhh. Quotes? Source? Something? LeeHarris has stated several times in the past that LoL is **more fun** than HoN. His problem is that the company that develops the game is incapable of developing such a fun game into a competitive E-Sport.

Your problem seems to be the inability to disassociate the game from the company that makes it. Riot is not LoL -- it is the company that *makes* LoL.

You say ""spreading words"" as though LeeHarris is slandering Riot. He's not; he's merely calling Riot out on the things they haven't implemented that they said they would.

Imagine if Riot said ""New champion coming out next week!"" and then didn't release a champion for another 6 months. You would be angry, because new champions are important to you, yes? Competitive gameplay is important to LeeHarris, so when these features (that were promised) that promote competitive gameplay are delayed, it makes him mad.

&gt;You are the type of people that made me stop playing with reddit members in fear of playing with bigots like you.

Bigot? Bigotry implies some sort of irrationality. As far as I can tell, every time LeeHarris 

&gt;a few extra notes: blizzard for the most part doesn't listen to the community, they listen when there is a large outcry like the whole Real ID thing.

Do they listen to the whinings of every single Bronze-leaguer on the Battle.net forums? No, because that's not possible. But they listen to the competitive community to make the game better. When top-level Zergs cried that ZvT was unwinnable, they fixed the matchup by increasing Roach range. When Maka submitted a replay showing that Void Rays were overpowered in a specific timing, Blizzard made sure that Void Rays' ability to punish a lack of anti-air wouldn't turn into an auto-loss for Terrans. They're not going to implement every single request (because that's completely infeasible) and they as well have not delivered on hugely requested features (""Do you really want chat channels?""), but when high-level players speak, Blizzard listens.

&gt;Riots interests ARE towards a friendly but also competitive game. Its hard to balance a game around high play and casual play at the same time. They are no where close to perfect but they aren't as bad as many make it out to be.

You can't have a competitive game without tournaments, and you can't have tournaments without spectators generating ad revenue. They have had ONE spectator tournament since the game was launched and had a large number of technical difficulties in pulling it off. Meanwhile, Blizzard's games have been broadcast on TV for upwards of 10 years now.

&gt;LeeHarris you have no insight on the games industry and seem to have a need to make riot looks bad. If you did, you would know your claims are wildly outrageous and plain stupid that the majority of resources goes into the characters they release.

Personal attacks because you're mad. The only response to ""majority of resources goes into the characters they release"" that I have is that even if a large amount of Riot's resources are dedicated to making the game competitive, the amount of progress visible to their *customers* has been negligible. Meanwhile, new characters that unbalance the metagame are being released every other week. Without looking at the internal structure of Riot, I can tell you that from the point of a customer interested in competitive gaming, this is unacceptable performance.

&gt;I realize my post is far too harsh on Lee but I want to make a point that me saying hes being a complete asshole when he really doesn't seem to be all the time, is the same amount he makes riot look bad by saying the problems are a lot worse than they are.

I don't understand your points. In summary, you say in your first paragraph that he both over and under-estimates the amount of time and (effort/resources) it takes to make skins. First, that is obviously contradictory. Secondly, I don't believe that skins are his main point at all. LeeHarris is saying that Riot is looking to make money, so they hire designers instead of a programmer to make the game better. He has a legitimate point in saying that Riot has said that viop and replays will be added for months and months, and no changes have been made. These changes will be what makes LoL into a competitive game.

On Södermalm (my home Malm):

[Nada](http://gulasidorna.eniro.se/f%C3%B6retag/nada:73236102?search_word=nada) - nice bar, not too pricey, plays indie and similar stuff, has spanish food.

[Berlin](http://kartor.eniro.se/query?what=map&amp;mop=yp&amp;advert_code=66034717_GS) - small friendly place, often crowded, people of all ages come here. Somehow manages to get bands crammed in from time to time. There is a place across the street, equally small and crowded, plays indie and electronica mostly. Forgot the name.

[Söderkällaren](http://gulasidorna.eniro.se/f%C3%B6retag/restaurang-s%C3%B6derk%C3%A4llaren:68904848?search_word=s%C3%B6derk%C3%A4llaren) and [Carmen](http://gulasidorna.eniro.se/f%C3%B6retag/carmen:67553761_gs?search_word=carmen) - two places close to subway-stn Medborgarplatsen, cheap and loud, has young crowd, lots of young unemployed left leaning geezers and students from sweden and abroad.

Kvarnen - also at Medborgarplatsen, the only place I can think of right now that serves decent swedish food. Maybe not that budget friendly, but worth a visit I'd say.

Someone mentioned [Strand](http://hornstullstrand.se/) and [Debaser](http://www.debaser.se/). Strand appeals to people in their 20s n 30s, has a club and a scene with mainly indie/pop/electronica bands. Check homepage. Debaser is actually two places - one at Medborgarplatsen and one at Slussen. I like the Slussen version best, but check homepage for what bands/clubs are on.

[Skrapan sky bar](http://kartor.eniro.se/query?what=map&amp;mop=yp&amp;advert_code=66034717_GS) - nothing indie/punk/rock about this place but there's no entrance fee and you get a great view of the city.

Södra teatern - pleasant. even better view if you get the best seats.

[Bröderna Olsson](http://gulasidorna.eniro.se/f%C3%B6retag/br%C3%B6derna-olssons-garlic-shots:68827049?search_word=garlic%20shots) - Rock music and food with shitloads of garlic.

South of Södermalm:

Färgfabriken - clubs a couple of nights per week. Check homepage. There is also a nice and rough (by Stockholm standards) semi-legal club just a block away called Pluto. Not sure if they're still open though.

Vasastan:

[Peppar](http://gulasidorna.eniro.se/f%C3%B6retag/peppar:67578387_gs?search_word=peppar) - takes down their christmas decor at easter, their easter decor at halloween and their halloween decor at christmas, or something. The opposite of tasteful. Unfortunately not as cheap as one would expect. Cajun food.

Other stuff:

Djurgården - big city park. Scenic. Take the tram from Hamngatan (subway T-centralen). While there, have lunch at Rosendal. Good food, sorta expensive though. Vasamuseet might be worth a visit, I haven't been there since kindergarden age but it's what all the tourists do.

***Favorites:***

* **LA**: very nice and comfortable life (for me; not saying for everybody in LA). It has a lot more diversity than the other places I've lived in, which means better food. I'm a big fan of food. Just this past month, I finally discovered a Central Asian/Uighur restaurant. Anyway, because of the diversity, people in LA are more accustomed to different things; so I feel people here are more open in the sense that they won't judge you for being different.
* **TW**: good, cheap, plentiful food! I may be biased because I'm Taiwanese. It's also very convenient here. Every block has a convenient store that sells everything, from the usual microwavable foods and alcohol to stationary and underwear.
* **KG**: good food here too! Beautiful scenery. Convenient public transportation system within the capital (if you know Russian). By far, my highlight here was the people. Most of my time here was spent interacting with the locals. Not everybody is friendly, but the students I taught were the nicest, friendliest, and most hospitable people I've ever met.
* **PL**: traveling! Living in Europe, you find out how easy it is to travel to other European countries. In my one year there as a med student, I visited Germany, France, Denmark, Norway, and Ireland along with shorter trips to other places. I also just enjoyed the general ""feel"" of the place. It wasn't clean-cut, Ikea-styled Scandinavia. Nor was it ""cultured"" and ""historical"" western Europe. Neither was it oppressive, backwards Soviet. It just felt like a good mix of all.

***Least Favorites:***

* **LA**: I feel like I can easily lead a complacent and unfulfilling life here. I know a lot of foreigners have their eyes set on New York or Hollywood. But to me, that's nothing. I guess you can say I'm restless and jaded. I feel like people here (including me) have it too well off and don't fully understand what it's like ""out there."" Conversely, I can also say people ""out there"" don't fully understand what it's like here. So, shrugs.
* **TW**: I can't say too much about Taiwan. I just generally like it there a lot. Okay, maybe the worst is the humidity and heat. I guess I'm kind of a novelty item there as somebody who looks like the locals but is culturally different as an ABC (American-born Chinese). But reverse discrimination does occur when ABCs try to find English teaching jobs. Employers often prefer white people over us (even if we're more qualified) only because of looks. Not bitter, though; I understand where their coming from.
* **KG**: By far the worst thing about KG is authority and corruption. Cops will often target foreigners because we're easier to harass and more willing to pay more money to get them off our backs. This model of corruption and bribery extends through all areas -- teachers to politicians. I don't know how it is now after the revolution and all.
* **PL**: Being a foreigner here isn't as fun. I feel most out of place here. I'm sure the locals aren't racist but I get that vibe a lot. Most of the Asians here are students and people will often just straight up stare at you for minutes. But once you really get to know them individually, they're nice. But, honestly, walking around at night especially if alone, I never know when I might get jumped.

***World Views***

Not sure what exactly I can say about this. All I can say is that the more you travel and live in different places, the more you realize that people are people. We're generally the same everywhere despite the different settings. Everywhere has good people and not-so-good (bad) people. You learn to recognize and acknowledge who you are and how you're different from those around you.

In Taiwan as an international kid and ABC, I want to show the locals there that we're not all loud and arrogant, condescending and proud just because we came from America. (You might already see this kind of behavior in immigrant communities where the second-generation kids poke fun at the new fobs.)

In KG as a foreign teacher, I want to show the locals that not all Americans are there to make quick money from English classes and get an easy girl from the bars.

In Poland as an international student, I want to show that we're not all rich elitists, ignorant and bored of the host country and culture we're in.

I guess generally, as a non-confrontationalist, I try to blend in and appreciate where I am. And if I can't, to at least maintain a low-profile and remain respectful of my surroundings. After all, I *am* a guest, living as an alien in places that have been homes to some for generations.

I am a very good looking man, striking, even, I'm told.  I'm quite smart, occasionally funny, and always myself.  Women?

It sure as hell wasn't me making the advances, and I often froze up when they did so, especially if it was verbal.  I never had any luck with women, in the sense that none of the good ones, the ones I genuinely liked, ever panned out.

Why?  Because I was a pussy.  I thought I was being 'pushy' if I asked a girl out without spending a few weeks drooling over her in secret and playing 'nice guy, good friend.'  So I was left with the sluts, the trash, and the leftovers.  The nice, worthwhile women were interested in men who were more confident, more 'solid' feeling.  Assertive.

Then I met someone.  I saw her online.  I had one look at her and I knew.  It was a done deal.  Settled.  She was mine, if she was any kind of woman worth being with at all.  It was love at first sight.  So, I read her page, and it seems she's married.  Well, fuck.

We talk, and talk... and talk... and by bedtime, I've learned she's several years into an unhappy marriage.  She sleeps.  I don't.  By breakfast, I've decided to steal her.

Nice guy shit stops.  Awesome guy shit starts.  A few months later we were engaged and buying a house.  People need to stop being pussies.  It works.

Hate to edit this, but 'steal' is a pejorative, when in fact we took 3 months before we even met, and her husband was made aware of me and the possibility within 8 days of hello.

"c12kyqo","While stationed overseas, I got a panicked call from a fellow dorm Dad during a typhoon.  ""The building is flooding!  What do I do?""

I grabbed a junior airmen I trusted, we donned two layers of rain gear, tied a rope to a pipe inside the building, then proceeded outside.  The other dorm was about 45 feet away but it took half an hour to crawl through the equivalent of mother nature's car wash, got to the door, and got inside.

Sure enough water was streaming down the walls.  Opening the central stairwell, there was a small waterfall of rain pouring down all the way up to the 5th floor.   Unlocking this door unleashed a deluge of water past my feet.    First thing I noticed, the floor was lined with plastic wrap and a lot of nervous looking jr. airmen were struggling to bail water off the floor.

The flooded dorm happened to be where the special forces airmen were kept, having spent a lot of time working with special forces, they're notable to being human pit bulls... super friendly but vicious dumb animals that appear to be impervious to pain.

"c12juqh","I've just skimmed through all the comments (163 atm), and I'm a bit shocked, actually.  I mean, I know we're all in a nerdy corner of teh interwebs, but there are really no substantial posts in *favour* of friends.  

So here comes one.

I am also introverted.  I have been shy, I have been pretty much friendless.  I do want and need a lot of alone time to keep my head screwed on straight.  I've always had a few very good, true friends, but since reaching adulthood, we've rarely lived in the same country, let alone the same town.  I was pretty lonely for several years, I had, as many have said, acquaintances, people with whom I was friendly, but real close friends were few and far between.  I was okay with that, because I am pretty independent and self-sufficient, but it wasn't ideal.  So, I decided to try to fix it. (Note:  Huge life changes in following story were not solely because I wanted more friends.  That was just one reason among many.)

First, I got a job in retail.  I was forced to speak to dozens of strangers everyday.  I had to ask and answer questions, deal with difficult customers, laugh with great customers, get along with colleagues, basically be social for long periods at a time in a controlled environment, so to speak.  That pretty much cured my shyness, and I made a couple more real, true friends out of my time there.

Then, I moved to China.  Being alone in a foreign country, whose language I didn't speak and customs I didn't understand, threw things into pretty sharp relief for me.  I had to talk to new people, or I wasn't going to get to talk at all.  I had to put myself out there.  I did discover however, that one of the great things about living abroad is fellow expats.  At home, I'd meet 50 people and find maybe 3 of them interesting.  Here, it's more like 1 out of 5 who isn't interesting, simply because if you've got your shit together enough to live in a foreign country, you've probably got some stories and ideas under your belt.  Also, expats, at least in my line of work, tend to come and go a lot, so every few months the group changes, and you get to meet a whole new lot of people.  This, in conjunction with learning about the culture here and meeting great local people, has made me realize that I actually do like people.  I was pretty sure I didn't before.  I've met tons of great people, and I've made lots of lifelong friends.  I've also realized that even friends that you have for a while, and then go a separate way from, are a great experience.  As of now, I have lots of friends.  I do things as part of a group about twice a week.  I still like to spend a lot of time alone, doing my own thing.  But I have balance.

  **tl;dr:  Friends are great.  They can be the family you choose instead of, or in addition to, the one you're given.  They can be the people who help you when you need it.  They can be someone you have one paradigm shifting conversation with, and then never see again.  They can just be someone to call up and grab dinner with because you don't feel like cooking.  They are beneficial to life in general.  Try to make some, you won't regret it.**",1287331080,"i was pretty lonely for several years, i had, as many have said, acquaintances, people with whom i was friendly, but real close friends were few and far between.","friendly, but real","friendly","but",TRUE,"friendly , but real","real",NA,NA,1

"c124yf0","I have to agree, if only from anecdotal evidence.

There are clear racial/spacial divides in just the small peninsula area, and police patrol the nicer ""white"" area 24/7.  Walk around the College campus downtown and notice almost all of the laborers (construction, cleaning and maintenance, food) are older and black.  Most of the faculty, as while as most people working front of the nice restaurants and shops downtown, are white.  It's rare to see a young black person visibly working in that area.

It's a nice neighborhood in the suburbs, maybe a bit more expensive than elsewhere, but not by too much, and not too far from the capital (about 1 hour by bus, 30 minutes by train or 20 by car). Other similar neighborhoods are Vicente Lopez (halfway between San Isidro and capital), Saavedra and Nuñez (both within capital city's limits, but still quite suburban).

Also within the capital the nicest neighborhoods are Palermo (where most wealthy foreigners end up), San Telmo (also foreigner-friendly but more bohemian), Belgrano and Coglan.

Short-term rentals are mainly directed to tourists and are generally quite expensive, but you might be able to find yourself something quite decent for around U$S 1000 a month (I think, I'm not too up-to-date with shor-term rental rates). You might be able to get discounts if you're staying for longer, not sure.

If you're planning to stay for a lot longer (say, from one to two years) and are willing to spend some time and effort finding yourself somewhere to live you might be able to find something quite decent for around U$S 500 a month. Long-term rentals are quite complicated down here though, and most owners won't even rent to foreigners, or you might end up having to pay everything up-front, so only do this if you're willing to put the effort and have somewhere to stay in the meanwhile.

"c11a2lx","It might help if you said what the second language is, and where you are. Cultural differences are important.

I would have to say that studying a foreign language and using it in the native environment is perfect training to be fearless in approaches. I remember once in Japan I was being introduced at a meeting in front of 500 people, and when I got to the podium, I misspoke and used the wrong word, it was an obvious blunder but I inadvertently insulted everyone. Just wait until you hear 500 people laughing about what you just said and you will have to get over your embarrassment real quick.

In an extremely foreign environment, you will have to get over AA too. I was always getting lost or having trouble finding a place to eat, so I had to approach random strangers for help. I was reluctant at first, but I'd spend hours wandering around, or miss meals and I was starving to death. So I had to get over it. It was intense practice for approaches. At first, I would sometimes approach a policeman for directions, they are always helpful and friendly. But then as I became more confident in my language abilities, I started approaching random people. Some were fearful of weird strangers (and Americans in Japan are always extremely foreign).

"c113527","I actually survived a classic emasculating friend-zone scenario to form a romantic relationship with my best friend (a girl) which is now in its fifth year.  Despite my success, I almost don't want to give advice on this - so much advice is on the internet already, and most of it is bad.  It all depends on the nature of your relationship.  If she feels completely free discussing relationships with other men, there's a good chance she doesn't think of you that way - which doesn't mean she won't.  It just means that if you tell her, and she doesn't go for it, your relationship *will* be different for a while.  She will not know whether she can tell you everything she used to.  This is probably going to be painful, but it's unavoidable - you *can't* upgrade a friendship to a romantic relationship without risking the friendship.

In fact, rather than go further I'll say what happened to me, without making any claims as to whether this will be your experience - these things are so individual I would hate to lead you astray.  We remained best friends for a long time after I made my feelings clear, and she largely ignored them.  Eventually, I made them unavoidable, and we grew apart a little.

Also, while employers hate this tip for obvious reasons, it is a must: Be able to limit any work-related access to yourself. Keep a separate cellphone. Keep a separate online identity that nobody knows about. Be able to go dark. Don't answer emails after-hours unless they are of the highest importance.

Just meeting and talking with people is like talking with the most friendly but diverse group of people you're likely to meet.

If you're asking about ""play parties"", I've been to a few at our local ""dungeon"", and it's... interesting.

"c0zjxne","For a couple years, I'd go play drop-in hockey before work.  The doors to the recreation centre opened at 5:15am, and at certain points in the year the drop-in games filled up quickly.  As such, many of us arrived at 5:00am and lined up outside, waiting for the doors to open, so we'd be guaranteed a spot on the hockey sign-up sheet.

There were usually 10 hockey players lined up outside, but even more frightening, there were usually 20+ people lined up outside *just to go to the gym*.  I will admit, the demographic for gym-goers seemed really skewed compared to the evening group -- almost all the people were 40+, and they seemed really relaxed and friendly.  But there were still quite a lot of them.

Furthermore, there's a window where the workout area looks out onto the rink we play on.  By the time I had my hockey gear on and was warming up on the ice -- around 5:30am -- you could see that the gym/workout area was bustling with activity.

Canadian healthcare is phenomenal. The only problem is the wait[;](http://www.blrag.com/storage/Healthcare%20waiting%20in%20Canada.png?__SQUARESPACE_CACHEVERSION=1250607252042) unless you know the right people - but I won't get into that. The cities are clean and well kept. Rarely does crime cross your mind, but it does exist so don't fool yourself. We are usually polite and friendly, but you shouldn't expect people screaming hi to you on the streets (unless they're homeless). The nightlife is to die for (Toronto, Montreal, Vancouver - I'm not sure about the prairies). Our schools are free, our post-secondary education fees are low compared to those in the states (though generous scholarships like athletic scholarships are practically non-existent). ""We"" love hockey, and you'll have a blast with friends watching the game. Our sports teams aren't as dominant as we sometimes think, though we have an impressive pool of talent all around. Summer Olympics are disappointing, Winter Olympics are (now) our stage. We love our beer. Multiculturalism is very observable and this is both good and bad - sometimes ignorance is a big problem. Traffic congestion is a nightmare during rush hour. Our taxes are painfully high, but we all get by. We're not as patriotic as the states, but we are hella proud to be Canadian. The ""structural infrastructure"" (not sure if I'm using the right term here) of Canada is perfect for green living (potential for a lot of highly efficient high-rise buildings). You do not need to learn French, though Canada is considered a bilingual country. Quebec is the only French speaking province in Canada (so many cute girls) and New Brunswick is the only 'official' (?) bilingual province. We don't start wars. The country is cold from September to April (about 10 C); snows between late November/December and late February/March. The real issue with the cold is the windshield effect.

Oh, if Sarah Pallin does get elected as President in the next elections, I expect her to declare war against Canada on her second or third menstrual cycle. 

If you have any specific questions, ask, I'd love to answer them (I guess this would make it an AMA in someone else's thread?).

"c0zfowo","I'm not sure how to rank my own attractiveness. I'm a 35 year old guy with a very ordinary-looking face and thinning hair, but a lean and athletic body. Intellectually I know that most people would find my body attractive, but I can't help personally finding it quite repulsive (albeit no worse than most other male bodies).

I've never had any difficulties talking to girls or establishing Platonic friendships with them, but because of my total lack of sexual confidence, I never try for anything more. In all the sexual relationships I have had, the girl made the first move. This has happened surprisingly often: It seems that some of the most attractive women are very tired of getting hit on all the time, and that they therefore are attracted to guys who respect them intellectually and are friendly towards them without making uninvited sexual advances. In my experience, the ""nice guy"" meme is a myth. Hot girls often *prefer* the nice guy. Curiously, this doesn't seem to improve my confidence. I still feel as ugly and unattractive as ever, even though the rational part of my brain knows I am no worse than most other men.

In everyday life, I feel that my looks are neither a help nor a hindrance. People generally don't seem to notice me at all unless I talk to them. When I do, they are almost always polite and friendly, but I think this has more to do with me being friendly towards them than with how they perceive my looks.

Edit: One thing I have noticed is that people very often ask me for advice on training and nutrition. They always seem to disregard whatever advice I give, though.

I think what you are facing is a lot of wishful thinking on their part, rather than misleading signals on your part.  I face some of this problem as a woman - I find that when I go out to clubs/bars with groups of friends, and become talkative and social with whoever happens to be loosely attached to the group I am with, the guys I talk to *always, always* end up thinking that I am flirting with them and showing sexual interest in them.  And I am not.  I'm just talking and being social and outgoing and friendly, but I'm not doing anything which could be construed as obviously flirtatious.  Its to the point that I almost feel like I can't chat with guys, I should only chat with girls, just to avoid the headache.  But I realize that it's not fair to expect me to never talk to men unless I am sexually interested in them, and it's not fair to blame myself for their unrealistic expectations/interpretations simply because I talked to them.  

I think in the same way, you should release yourself from feeling responsible for how others misinterpret your friendliness.  Unless you're doing the kinds of things you mentioned ""Hey when we're dating I should take you to XYZ"", then your general friendly openness is not a statement of romantic interest, and if they take it that way it really isn't your fault.

also lakes: most of the big ones have great campsites and often sand beaches. this time of year you might be able to get into mushroom picking and certainly be able to drag a couple fat trout out of almost any lake with some luck. (lucky lager never hurt with that)

i must suggest you check out the Backroads Map Book, it's like 25 bucks but totally worth it if you want to be able to find the best secluded spots.  there's not just maps in the book, but also many listed camping areas, popular fishing spots and points of interest (eg big-ass trees) 

and get a vehicle with a spare tire and hopefully some good tread/quality so you can adventure off road. 90% of the main logging roads on the island are reasonably car-friendly but notable exceptions (road to bamfield from alberni can suck really bad, and the road from lake cowichan to connect with the alberni-bamfield road is the worst ever) the wrong pothole could mean a shitty stranding dozens of kilometres from the nearest human. but i can say with a lot of experience that you'll be fine in most situations with a 4cyl and light accelerator foot. 

check out mt washington in courtenay if you're into hiking, biking or have an interest of seeing the coast from the top of a mountain (the summer chair lift rides are reasonable but bring a jacket it's still cool at high elevations!) on a really clear day you can see Mt Baker and beyond.  irregardless, bringing a bike in the car can help make any strandings less of a problem, as well as really expanding your out-of-car range (lots of places have 'no cycling' signs but don't worry no ones going to bug you about it, just don't wear your headphones on the trail so you can hear people approaching and use common sense on blind corners.)

take a ferry: quadra, cortez, hornby, denman, saltspring, etc etc all of these islands have amazing little communities and secluded nature stops that can't be missed. another benefit of the islands are the lack of dangerous wildlife and limited RCMP presence.  lets just say islanders are a little extra 'free as in liberty.'  But for the bear-wary, don't worry about running across a blackbear on almost any gulf island, but if you go to Carmanah-Walbran or anywhere north of Sayward you might want to bring some bear spray, a large dog or some noisy friends.

also via ferry you can check out the sunshine coast, try to time your visit to hike the trail to see the skookumchuck narrows tide run. 

the route from whistler to pemberton to the interior is a nice change in scenery from those other highways. the kootenays are also a wonderful natural destination with a plethora of outstanding opportunities (hotsprings!)

I hope you're able to recognize that the hardships you are enduring will help you gain valuable insights about yourself and your strength that you wouldn't if you were as privileged as your friend.  Try to remember that a lot of her insensitivity probably stems from being so sheltered in life, and that when she does end up dealing with adversity it'll most likely make her appreciate what you've gone through.

Since you've agreed to meet her I think you should keep the appointment.  It sounds like ditching would be a choice you'd make to avoid conflict and discomfort, but meeting those things head-on will help you resolve them.  If you cancel you'll just have to carry that around - I know I fell shitty when I've avoided something out of anxiety.

I think you should do your best to be forgiving and friendly, but also address the fact that her comments about your struggles made you feel angry and hurt.  She should know that what she said was insensitive.  There's a good chance that she already has more perspective than she did then, and you'll probably find that you have enough common ground to have a pleasant coffee.  There's no need to drag it out if you're not having fun, either.

If she gets critical again you can let her know that she has no right to judge you and bid her good day.

"c0x0n2w","It felt like my first day of college wasn't so long ago (September 2003).  Here is some things I learned after my first month that should help.

* Keep in mind, most importantly, that most people are in the same boat as you. That means a lot of freshman don't know anyone else.
* Don't be shy, talk to people.  I know in high school it's weird to go up to someone you don't know and say ""hi"", but everyone in their first week of college is thinking ""holy shit I hope someone talks to me already because I'm too scared to do it myself"" (maybe not in those words, but you get the point). Say hi, ask them where they're from, how they like it there so far, etc. If you do it often enough, chances are you'll find a couple of people, at least, to hang out with.
* Participate in first week activities. Most colleges have things set up to meet other incoming freshman.  Go to these and again, say hi to people and interact with others.
* Remember, you'll make friends. If you had friends in high school (even just one) what would make you think college would be any different? 
* Be nice and friendly, but don't overdo it.  I remember people who appeared standoffish or didn't crack a smile when I first talked to I wouldn't go back and talk to again. It might have been because they were nervous, but I had no desire to talk to them after our initial convo. Also, avoid being friendly to the point of irritating people. There were a couple of people who were just too much for me (and most of the dorm I was in).
* See what's going on in your dorm hallway at night. This is big.  People are likely wandering around or just hanging out in the halls. It's okay to go up to them and ask how's it going. I met a few friends by walking around my dorm hall and seeing what's going on.


One important thing to remember, you might not make a friend the first day, but you will make friends.  I went to college with a close buddy back home. I got lucky and made friends my first day, but he did not. It took him 2 weeks before he met some people (and he was depressed before that time), but now those people he sees regularly still.

But this kind of bothers me. Who says we can't change it?

I think so many immigrants and foreign residents are too quick to toe-the-line, keep their heads down, and adopt a ""thing never change, so why try?"" attitude. But change and progress are inevitable. Japan, as with all nations, will globalize or it will die. And multiculturalism is an inseparable part of globalization.

"c0uocq2","I'm a bit older than you (37) and I think you're going to be fine.  Here's a few things I can add:

1.  You're not ugly, not even close.  If I ran into you at the local bar, I'd definitely start a conversation.  If I found out you were a Redditor, I'd be angling for a date.  You're beautiful, really you are.  Women come in all sorts of shapes; attractive women are attractive and you absolutely are.

2.  The weight.  Don't think about this as an attractiveness issue, think about it as feeling good.  Two years ago, I weighed about 260 lbs.  Today, I'm around 150 lbs.  I feel better than I did 20 years ago.  Taking off weight will make you feel great, keep at it.  I mostly lost through a serious change in diet.  I tried working out, etc., but nothing really came off until I changed my diet.  Then it started disappearing about 2 lbs. a week.  If you want an idea of how I did it, Google the Hacker's Diet.  You might also want to read Carol Lay's book, ""The Big Skinny.""  Both of them lay out what you need to do.  But don't focus on being attractive, keep telling yourself how good you're going to feel.  As more comes off, you're going to want to lose more to feel better.  Just keep going - you can do it.

3.  Social awkwardness can be fixed.  You've already taken a BIG first step with this post.  You're finally seeing what happens when you engage other people, right?  I used to be a little awkward, too, but have made a lot of progress.  Here's what you do, make eye contact, smile and say hello to pretty much everyone you run across.  Not everyone will and not everyone will be friendly, but you're going to be surprised at how many people respond positively to you.  Get involved in a group, volunteer, become a regular at a bar, get out there.  I spend a bit of time at a favorite bar.  I go in and say hello to everyone, men and women.  You'll become known and if you're friendly and outgoing, you will get friends and attract people.  Don't assume that people are going to reject you.  If you start engaging people, and a simple ""hi"" and a smile will do that, you're going to have your pick of men.

4.  Stay in school and keep looking for work.  Be sure to get your education.  If no work turns up, then start your own business.  Even if you have to clean houses or do yard work, or whatever, find a way to make money.  If you don't have marketable skills, start learning some.  Take some classes, learn how to fix stuff, and so on.  You'll find a way to make money.

5.  If you're not doing anything creative, start.  If you have a digital camera, start taking photos.  Read the Internet and learn how to make them better - you don't need expensive equipment.  Or take up drawing, writing, a musical instrument, painting, whatever.  Don't beat yourself over a ""lack of talent,"" just pick something you like and start doing it.  Learn and read, and you'll probably become good to great at it.  Something creative is a huge outlet and will let you connect with others, too.

Anyhow, you've gotten lots of good advice here and I'm glad you're taking it seriously.  Like I said at first, I think you're going to turn out fine.  And I think you're going to be very happy.  What would be great is if you posted here a year or two from now to let everyone know how much better your life is.

"c0ubp3d","Just out of curiosity, whats wrong with having a heater running?  Under-tank heating pads are pretty low wattage thus don't cost much to run and they are also safe provided you use them correctly.

I ask because snakes are hands down the easiest pet you can find.  Feed them once a week or sometimes every other week.  Cleanup is simple and they don't stink up the cage quickly.  They don't need friends.  And they're generally tolerant of being handled.

Leopard geckos are also excellent pets.

Moving on...
There isn't much to work with with fuzzy things believe it or not.  

Cats and dogs are out due to maintenance.  Ferrets as well.

Unfortunately rabbits are not good pets unless you can let them run free most of the time.  They can freak out if stuck in a cage all day.  Although they can be litterbox trained, so as long as you rabbit-proof the house you don't always need a cage.

A guinea pig might be a good alternative, but just to warn you, they get stinky FAST so they are sort of higher maintenance.  You'll be spending alot of money of shavings and unfortunately you CANNOT get away with buying the cheap stuff as pine and cedar shavings are deadly.

I wouldn't suggest a chinchilla as they are mostly nocturnal and tend to need a friend with whom they make a shit ton of noise while you try to sleep.  They also need a pretty big cage as they are very active.

Rats are hands down the best fuzzy pet that I've seen and had.  They are literally like little dogs.  They are loyal, affectionate, smart, etc.  They can also be litterbox trained.  However, it takes some time to get them there so they aren't QUITE low maintenance.  They really need a friend at all times and a fairly large tank or cage for them to play in so they aren't bored while your gone.

Mice can be cool and pretty friendly, but they also tend to get smelly very fast.  Otherwise treat them like rats.

Degu and jerboas are pretty damn awesome to watch, and for the most part cleanup is pretty easy.  But they also tend to be a little less affectionate than other fuzzy things.

Gerbils aren't too bad either, although they don't tend to be as friendly as other fuzzies unless you find one as a baby that hasn't 'gone wild' in a pet store cage yet.

So to tell you the truth, it sounds like your best option is a standard hamster.  Again, get a young one (and avoid dwarf varieties) if at all possible so it is friendly.  I also advise a large cage/tank as you can go longer without it getting smelly.  Some folks say they need friends, but from what I've seen (and I admit I could be wrong here) they are more solitary.

"c0seteu","Dude, don't you get it yet?  

The world would be such an awesome place if everybody spent at least a week in every other country before they could vote.  It doesn't happen but, in this day and age, it doesn't stop people knowing *the shit* about another country.  

Half the people who thought the US under Bush was behaving like a dick hadn't been to the US - at least.   It didn't make it less right.  Even visiting wouldn't change that.  They'd come back saying most people in the US are really cool and friendly*...but Bush and his administration still behaved like dicks.*  The same could be said visiting Israel....""Man, Tel Aviv rocks and the people were awesome...*but the shit the state does to the Palestinians stinks!*""

When someone says, ""Israelis bring the hate upon themselves"" the difference is that when Bush was being a dick the internet was swarmed with people, most of them from the US, saying exactly the same.  They didn't wait for them to be told.  They lit a big internet candle and shouted for attention.   Sure, there were those in the US that wanted to call and ridicule and deride  anybody that said that war in Afghanistan/Iraq was wrong; or those that would plaster over the endless spending, civil liberty encroachments and removal of corporate regulation.  To shout out that it was unpatriotic and that they should support the troops and their nation during a delusional 'War on Terror'.  It didn't mean that they were right.  If anything it was more patriotic for the people that felt that way to speak out so as to bring the troops home to safety.  To save the economy.  To save the Gulf of Mexico even.  And the US, (as a non-American) rocked in their internet youth rebellion.  Nowhere was it more vocally anti-US administration than in the hearts and keyboards of the US people.

When someone says, ""If they acted civilized we wouldn't hate them"" let me say this in response; as a non-Israeli who is very critical of the current Israeli state's actions:  **I DO NOT HATE ISRAELIS.**  Far *fucking* from it.  I support the Israeli guys disapproving of the current Israeli policies as much as I supported the Democrats who genuinely wanted 'Change' and the Internet Ron Paul Republicans who genuinely wanted to return to the Republican Party to Republican roots.        

Having been to Israel, or the US, or Europe, or the Middle East, or far flung Asia, is no longer neither here nor there.  We're all interconnected.  Logistically, economically, physically and instantaneously through information media.  We all know that we could, languages apart, fly in a day from Boston to Madrid to Baghdad; from Beijing to Moscow to Rome, and be speaking to one another and find people we'd get along with.  Many already do it in the comfort of their own dens through X-box, Facebook or Skype.

It's no longer a planet of 19th and early 20th century nationalism where when someone dissed a country and  predominantly flags and jingoism took over.  They announced war with Germany in 1914 and Britain went tub thumping in the streets in appreciation.  One hundred years later, even against Iraq, the tub-thumpers in the street were the anti-war lobby; and development in this regard has been exponential since.   Notice the comment prior to the one you responded to said 'Jews' and the responder replied, in English, with 'Israel'.  Jewish people are all over the English speaking world.  He didn't show a problem with people or Jewish people.  He referred to a state.  The state of Israel.  I can't speak for him but I'd suggest, coming without paranoia or preconception, not the Israeli people but the Israeli government itself...and yes...talk to US citizens about that too.   Because during Bush those that travelled often had to find themselves explaining that one to people.  Explaining time and time again that 'Bush was a dick in their eyes too.'  Well, same applies.  **If you want Israel to regain international recognition Israelis must pass through the same gauntlet that sooooo many American cousins did in the US i.e. Israelis saying ""Not in my name!"" and then promoting that.**  [**Many Israelis already are.**](http://www.btselem.org/English/About_BTselem/Human_Rights_Sites.asp)

"c0sd7lo","I remember when the Olympic torch passed through Canberra during the lead up to the Beijing games. I went to Parliament House with some mates and joke protest signs i.e. 'Just here to meet asian girls!' etc.

The Chinese Students Association, with clandestine support from the Chinese government shipped in tens of thousands of Chinese students from around Australia. Some Chinese people were friendly, but most were frothing. 

We had to pass through a gauntlet of people on Commonwealth Bridge who were spitting at us, swearing at us in Chinese and throwing food at us. There was a rumor spread amongst the Chinese that the pro-Tibetan protesters were paid $1,000 to show up.

People came right up into my face and without saying anything, took photos of me and walked away. They were generally students and I assume, Chinese plants. I honestly think all of us were cataloged and put on a black list. 

If you were white and in the vicinity of Parliament House that day, you were fair game. I saw a woman with a pram, who wasn't protesting, almost get thrown into Lake Burley Griffin.

"c0rexfi","I'm essentially a native of Seattle (family moved to the area when I was four) and I've done similar things to what you describe; I moved to Las Vegas and lived there for four years on a whim and have just recently moved back to Seattle again after spending the last five years in California (1 in Monterey and 4 in the Bay Area).  I can't compare and contrast to the east coast but I can say that Seattle is a great place to be and the place I keep coming back to.  It has a natural beauty that has to be seen to be believed, and you've got to go find it to truly appreciate it.  One of the first things you should do when you get here is ride on a ferry through the San Juan islands and drive down to Mount Rainier or Mount Saint Helens for a day.  In fact, plan on needing a car, the mass transit is nowhere near as good as it is in San Francisco.  But that would let you go see all kinds of cool things.  You will also get much of the West Coast flavor but in a slightly different brand than in SF.  

The weather, which is legendary is poorly understood outside the area.  What you can expect are gorgeous summers that go well into September or October and winters that are drizzly and overcast.  We don't actually get a ton of rain as far as the rain gauge registers but it is delivered in a constant drizzle form.  You should also invest in a good goretex jacket as well.  Layers and waterproofing are important and are locally fashionable.  Not that anyone is really gonna care, hell you can get away with wool socks and Birkinstocks no problem.  But aside from keeping dry you'll find the winters are pretty mild.  We rarely get snow and when we do it doesn't stick around for long at all.  It does shut the city down though, even less than an inch will cause all kinds of chaos.  Aside from not being used to it or having a huge snowplow infrastructure we have lots of hills around here.

As for the people, well, I'm not sure what to say to you.  My experience with SF doesn't exactly match yours.  I mean, I know lots of people that just hang around and smoke too much pot up here and in SF but I also know people who are doing cool and exciting things as well.   SF is where Burning Man originated, I'm sure there were pot heads amongst that crew.  Your mileage is going to vary obviously depending on who you roll with.  But Seattleites also have a reputation for being friendly but hard to get to know that you should be prepared for.  As a for example, parties are famous for being events where everyone pretty much already knows each other already as opposed to places to meet new and interesting people.  While we are extremely polite it can often be hard to break through our shells and make friends - at least that's what I've been told by others from outside the area.  But that's just anecdotal and I've seen anecdotal evidence of the contrary as well. I have a good friend that I met in Las Vegas who lives here and since moving up here she has amassed a huge circle of friends through work and the art community.  &lt;shrugs&gt;

A few days later we did get a friendly but firm letter reminding us that the EULA for the test release did not allow reverse engineering of the game.

"c0qvbxu","I bought my Garand from the CMP back in 2004. I had the fortune of attending their Western Games match on Camp Pendleton (shooting a borrowed Garand in the match). While there they bring out a large selection of rifles for sale and allow you to tag the one you want with your name, then complete the purchase later via mail.  I got to examine first hand the differences between the grades.  I grabbed a Service grade that had a terrible stock.  Checked it's throat expansion at less than 1.1 which was fantastic! I got a new stock for my birthday and now I have a phenomenal looking gun.  All parts were matched except the op rod. I could not have gotten a gun this great without picking it out myself.

1. If you care about looks and amateur competition go with the service grade.  If you just want something that'll hit your target every time the field grade is fine. The main difference is going to be accuracy and cosmetics. A field grade rifle is going to not look very pretty. There will be dings in the stock, possibly chunks of wood missing.  There will be scratches and pitting in the metal. Parts will be mostly mismatched. The barrel throat expansion will be at least double of a service grade (I brought a gage and measured several), impacting the accuracy. I can imagine that the difference in accuracy with say a SR-1 target might be between the X (Service) and the 10 ring (Field), but on a MR-31 target it'll be between the 10 (Service) and the 8 (Field) ring.

2. [Lots of clubs hold monthly or quarterly Garand only matches](http://clubs.odcmp.com/cgi-bin/matchUpcomingSearch.cgi). Try to get in one of these, especially if you go for the service grade. The competition is friendly but fun, and you'll meet several other people that bought from CMP that you can shoot the shit with after you shoot the paper. Otherwise you can just join the [Garand Collectors Association](http://clubs.odcmp.com/cgi-bin/clubInfo.cgi?clubID=260), which is not a shooting club, just a non profit organization. They fulfill CMP requirements, and will send your name into the CMP if you want them to.

Best place I've ever been. I know you have a family, but note that a few days in Hawaii will really kick up the drive to want to be alone if you know what I mean. There's something in the air there. It also smells like flowers in bloom all the time.

But I would say there is more than enough for a curios kid to see.

First off it depends on what side of the Big Island. You have the Kailua-Kona side and the Hilo side. But if compelled you could essentially see the whole island in a day or two.

The difference is that Hilo is the more urban area and Kona is a more rural and tourist area. Hilo is a rainforest, Kona is almost a desert. I stayed in Kona. Something to note is that the locals are mostly friendly but some Hawaiians don't really like white people so be aware of offending a 300 lb 6'5"" dude. But they are generally laid back and friendly. Drugs are pretty bad so some areas have been taken over by the meth heads. I stayed in a hotel across the street from ""Meth Beach"" but they make a lot of cool arts and crafts stuff for cash and sell them.

So I'd say there is more for the family in Kona area but more of a nature kind of thing than an amusement park. 

So here are some areas of note. On the northern side of the west coast there is a huge valley. Forget the name but its an unmistakable land mark. They shot some movies there like Jurassic Park. You recognize the waterfalls if you saw the movie. Its quite a bit of a hike down a fairly treacherous ""path"" but there are grannies on it so if you take it slow and steady its a really cool site where a river flows into the ocean and there some black sand there. It a nice little picnic area but there is a massive current. Oh and much of hawaii's roads are treacherous if you can rent a 4x4 do it. And not only that they can be tough to drive on. Its like barely two lanes of 45 mph up and down over really quick hills, no street lights and then worses dude fly by you doing about 60 in WRX's and Lancers. One sad point there are a ton of crosses from people crashing. Its not really grassy mostly lava flow. 

There are only like 8 main roads on the whole island but while some I would say are adventurous they're all pretty accessible.

Back to the trip. The main strip in Kona is nice. There is a mix of family and adult stuff and the typical tourist stuff. Not so much Jersey shore boardwalk stuff but similar with more craft shops and all. Oh and many people will try to sell ""authentic Hawaiian"" shit that they bought at Walmart. One of the shopping centers (there's a total of about three) hosts events every week on Fridays they had Hula dancers. Which is great. Dad's get to use their kids as an excuse to see pretty hot ladies shaking their hip in manners you really don't see to often. Many are kids but there were enough over 18 to make your heart beat faster. I mean Shakira didn't hold a candle to what these girls were doing. Quite the sight and its free. Although your standing in the middles of a tourist trap and all.


You could have a nice trip just hanging around there and doing the tourist thing but I liked sight seeing. The other thing is while you can spend tons of money on stuff like heli rides there are always cheaper alternatives and talk to the locals more than the trip planners. They all seem to have a gem that was worthing investigating. 

One important thing to know. Every beach is publicly accessible. All of them! (There aren't many beaches mostly lava) So you can take a free trip to the local Hilton resort which is about as ritzy as it gets. It was built by some Japan company that folded so its full of Japanse art. A really cool place to watch the sunset.

There is a beach called Magic beach, sand only appears there during certain months. Buts its like the local beach. Picnics and all a little crowded but its really nice. 

When you can grab a snorkel and jump in and look around. Get your own from walmart don't get raped unless you want to help the local economy or whatever. Point is when you look in the water it looks like an amazing aquarium. You may have to watch the child but there are a few small pools that kids can have fun in. There are things like sea urchins and uh... tiger sharks but there's a lot of coral too and sea turtle sanctuaries. On my last day I had a women pushing me hard to stay for one more day to go swimming with manatees. She was just a local who did that, I couldn't stay though but that type of stuff happens.

There are also a ton of historical building churches and landmarks and all. There is even movie theaters. 

As I said you could spend you're whole time at the Kona area its a lot like anywhere else in America. Walmarts, Burger Kings, Home Depot. But at the beach.

Down south there is a place aptly called South Point. Its more of a sight seeing place than any fun unless you want to jump off a 60' cliff into ocean with the local kids. Its a fishing spot but the site of it is amazing to me anyway. I didn't have a worthy truck but down the road from there was some green sand beaches and then further you can see some black sands and then lava flows I heard. 

Along the trip south of Kona there are a ton of little nooks and crannies like small shops and little stands. I wouldn't recommend just wandering down side roads but trust me a shop owner or random local always has a story about an area or something that is really cool. Don't hesitate to be curious. All you smell on the trip down is coffee beans growing and the occasional marijuana farm. Authentic Kona coffee literally is crack take as muc home as you can.

So from there you can check out the mountains. A cool spot is the Nasa observatory pretty sure on Mona Koa but you can't not find it. Now you can head up in any car and then take a tourist bus up the top, or you can do what I did and spin tires up a pretty scary mountain. Its is going to be cold up there about 13,000 feet up. The telescopes are cool picture worthy, you likely have seen them on tv before. Its a little scary if you try on your own but if plan it right you might catch a glimpse of the milky way.  Depends on the winds and the fumes out of the volcano. That's something too. It always seemed to be gorgeous all day then about three in the afternoon the winds changed and it got dreary but it only rained once. So point is plan things to be done earlier in the day.

I didn't get to Hilo but I could only imagine that there are interesting stuff to see there as well its a rain forest.

Again I would move there if I could. The pot is KO and easily acquired, so make sure the kids in bed and everyone is home.

Oh and finally prices are very weird there. Sometimes items like a 20 ounce pepsi is like $2 but a one liter is $1.69. Expect everything to be more expensive than your used to but wages are way up there, they had signs on all the local fast food places advertising there starting wages which all were over $10 and hour. Bottom line is eat the stuff Hawaiians eat and save some money.

Again you could spend a whole fulfilling trip in town or take a drive and see more, no where on the island is too far to get to in a few hours. I was working 6 days a week 10 hours a day. I only got a few days to explore but I will tell you will not be disappointed with the Big Island if you decide to take the trip. Well worth it.

Oh and all of Hawaiian is haunted. Its just a way of life there. Be respectful.

My best advice is be curious and friendly and you should be led to a whole host of interesting stuff. Man I wish I could go back.

Sorry if any typos just shot this off, hope it helps. Hawaii is amazing.

"c0q7kbq","My husband and I had a similar experience in 2007.  After a storm in which our two larger dogs barked at thunder, someone came into our house through a window.  Our friendly but loud dogs barked incessantly for us to get up, but we were too groggy from their barking during the storm to realize they were barking for a different reason this time.  When we got up in the morning, we found several things missing, the window frame out, the door wide open, and our cat wandering the yard.

To answer your question, you won't feel safe for quite a few months.  I don't think there is anything that can heal that feeling of betrayal except for time.  We already have a security system, but we only use it if we will be gone for long periods of time.  Now we have a bat by our bed because we don't believe in keeping a gun.  We are a lot more trusting of our dogs' instincts now.  I think it is actually a blessing for us and for you that you didn't know what was going on while it was happening.  What if you did get up to see what was going on and have some kind of confrontation that could end with someone getting hurt?  The best thing is to deal with the shock and fear of it all, and purchase some mace and/or a bat/blunt object to have on hand.

I live in the back half of a duplex, the front has double lane roads.
I am hanging out recovering from a trip when my kitten runs in the house and to the window with it's hair standing on end.

I go out and there is a big dog in the yard.  I yell at it to go on when I see a girl with a rope.  She has been following the dog because she saw it almost get hit 3 times.  Her and her boyfriend have been trying to round it up, she is on foot and her boyfriend is in a truck.  The dog is friendly but skittish.  We get the rope on him and find his tags.  I call the number and the owner is a block away looking for him.  I tell her the address and to meet us out front.

We hand the dog off to the owner, make a little small talk when a passerby says,""Is that your boy?""  Everyone is thinking she is talking about the dog and the owner goes into,""he's a good dog...""

Then I see this 2 year old boy in the middle of the double lane road coming toward us.  I ran out stopping traffic and grabbed him.  He had already made it half way and it's a high traffic area.

Yaletown or Gastown are both lovely places, with Yaletown being more expensive. If you're living downtown, a car probably won't be much help. Commercial Drive is a great area as well, but it's farther from downtown, although the neighbourhoods there are all very nice, and restaurants and shops on commercial drive are all good. Another nice area would be the Kitsliano area, close to great shops and the beach. I haven't been to Ottawa enough to know where Centertown is, but I can assure you that the transit system here is more than effect enough to bring you from anywhere to downtown.

The skytrain + bus system will bring you almost everywhere important. If you are planning on working in the downtown area, the Canada line brings you straight into downtown. Quite a few people take it, since it solves the problem of finding parking and paying for parking. I personally prefer taking the train+bus just because I hate finding and paying for parking. Driving around downtown can get quite hectic at rush hours too.

For the ISP, it depends on how fast you want to go, and what area you will be in. We have teksavvy here as well so you could just stick with that. If you need really high speed, we have Novus in highly populated areas such as downtown yaletown, with ridiculous speeds.

  **First the good:**
High rankings, a lot to offer, some really great profs, if you're a science person, there are way more opportunities for prof guided and individual research in pretty much any area you can think, ties to Brookhaven National labs, food isn't bad, a lot of organizations to become familiar with, multiple libraries is a major plus. A lot of student/grad student/professor interaction if you work at it.

The beach is 2minutes away, Port Jeff has a lot to do during the day, and a lot of bars at night.

When you join us, most of the new construction will be done (CN Yang hall, The Simmons Center,  a lot of renovations). 

  **The bad:**
Major budget cuts in the past few years have led to the loss of 5000 seats in classes next semester, and many adjunct profs are gone. That means less courses offered and larger class sizes. If you're a science person, this is irrelevant because our classes are big anyway, and we didn't lose that many faculty. 
The science courses here are typically harder than many other SUNY and private schools, thats not to say they train you better, but they are graded on a pretty steep curve, I transferred here from a different SUNY, and my brother from a private, many of my friends did similar, and we all agree SBU likes to torture our GPA's.
The school is NOT a diverse campus, it is an asian campus, thats not a bad thing, but it may be something to get used to. There are a lot of cliques, especially from the city dwelling sup groups, most of the FOB's on the other hand are very open and friendly. But there is a very predominant asian influence in everything from the food, to the buildings, clubs, EVERYTHING.

In the past there have been a lot of commuters at this school, I have noticed this is a dying trend as more people are staying on campus however during the colder months, there isn't a lot going on. That being said, the campus does still get pretty dead during weekends, but finding a good core group of friends can very easily prevent you from noticing. 

  **Be social,** a major concern among almost all students is the antisocial vibe most people here give off on a day to day basis. This has led to a lot of the cliques, and prevents most people from finding friends and partying together. Of course, this also leads to people being motivated to leave on weekends.
  **if you make yourself open to others** on this campus, people will be open with you, its just that people here really need the catalyst. **participate,** the football games and basket ball games get crazy, the events on campus are pretty good, if poorly publicized, there is a lot to do, but you have to look, and you have to be active. The people who are most miserable here, are the ones that spend every day stoned in their rooms with the same 3 people. 

All of the negative stigmas that exist about this school stem primarily from people being antisocial, the past two classes to come in have really been working against that, and I'm sure yours will too. Good luck in your studies.

"c0pekp1","Yes psychology uses the word personality to describe people's traits, and there are many many personality tests. Here is a definition for it: the complex of all the attributes--behavioral, temperamental, emotional and mental--that characterize a unique individual. Being able to define someone's personality suggests there is a fixed description of someone. But people are situational. They adapt. My friends would call me an honest person, because they know me for telling the truth. But I lie, I lie all the time as well. What does that make me? Honest, or a liar? They are contradicting personality traits. How can we use characteristics to define personality, when we are all representatives of every trait imaginable.

I am honest, I am dishonest.

I am friendly, I am mean and scathing.

I am antisocial, I am outgoing.

I am happy, I am sad.

All those characteristics would accurately describe me, depending on who you are, and in which situation you encountered me. I am friendly more often than I am not because I use the control I have over my life to put myself in situations that are non-combatant and friendly.

OK, actual advice...
1. Expect to be up eating very late, regular North American hours do not apply when socializing, folks there stay up late and have a lot of fun. Change your habits or you will be very tired.
2. Childcare is extremely cheap, take advantage of that. You can get a cook too and still pay a fraction of what you would in NorthAm.
3. Be careful. Kidnapping of expats (or their children) happens. Not every day, but it does. Stay aware, and you can even hire a bodyguard if you want to go somewhere potentially risky (they aren't that expensive there relative to NorthAm).
4. Stay in the safe areas that you know (or learn), it's easy to find yourself in a bad one, so plan accordingly.
5. Hospitals there are not so great (relative to good hospitals in the US/Canada). Not much you can do about it, but something to think about.
6. If you like sushi, you are going to be very happy. They have a lot of non-traditional sushi there, but it's awesome.

You'll probably have a lot of fun, the people there are great and very friendly, but definitely have a different perspective than people from the States and Canada.

"c0ou8cw","I used to know someone with a raccoon. She said the females made very good pets, to a point. (The males tend to go wacko when they get grown, testosterone poisoning, but so do about half of unaltered male cats.) They house break easily but have these little hands so it wasn't unusual to come in and find the raccoon had taken every pot out of the cabinets and spread them out on the kitchen floor. But she was lovey-dovey otherwise. 

But she destroyed so much that my friend started locking her up in a cage. As long as she took the raccoon out daily and played with her she stayed friendly. But when my friend got a job and didn't have time to give her attention, the raccoon turned mean. Finally she put her outside and let her be an outside raccoon, still feeding her. But she got where she came home less and less and finally not at all. 

If you get a male you need to get it fixed but unless you have a license to keep it most vets won't do it.

The good:
Cold winters, warm summers. Clean. Friendly, but extremely shy and reserved, people. Secular. Freedom of speech. No corruption. Saunas. Truly awesome social safety-net. Free education (I acctually get paid to go to university), free healthcare. Pretty good infrastructure. Safe. Very little crime except the occational barfight and drunk driver.

The bad:
Everything is ridicilously expensive. High taxes. Winters can get depressing (high suicide rates). Matti Nykänen. People drink way too much alcohol. And the worst of all, although this won't be a problem for a foreigner, finns can be quite nasty towards members of the swedish speaking minority.

"c0o1smx","First time was at a very large house party, during the year I lived in Florida. It was about 3 years ago, when I was 19 or 20. The party was hosted by good friends, and all the people there seemed perfectly sweet and friendly, but there were a *lot* of them, and I'd never met most of them. I'm shy by nature, and although I can become a social butterfly and have great fun at big loud parties, it's something I've had to learn through effort. In short: as I now realize in retrospect, this was *not* the ideal environment for me to get high for the first time.

I took a few monstrous hits through a loooong hose. Didn't feel much at first. Then, aw fuck. I remember feeling as though my thoughts were *strobing*, and that I could only think and process speech in half-sentence bursts, never quite getting a grasp on any one idea. It alarmed me, because I didn't realize that there's a different way of thinking and processing stimuli while high and I just hadn't got the hang of it yet.

The 'Sober' door was closed, and I just kept throwing myself against it like a moth bumping against a window, not realizing that there was another door right next to it, wide open. The panic led to repetitive thoughts—""I can't think, I can't think, I can't think, I'm not myself, I'm not myself, I've gone numb""—which led to a mild (but still upsetting) anxiety attack. In the end, I just laid on the floor with my boyfriend-at-the-time waiting for it to wear off.

Fortunately, it didn't put me off weed forever. I knew right away that I'd way overdone it for my first time, and that the environment had not been suitable.

I tried again a handful of times after that, but had the opposite problem: smoking out of a small glass spoon, I didn't feel anything at all. It wasn't until just a few months ago, when a lovely and *very* generous friend gave me an eighth to take home and play with, that I started learning how to do it right.

"c0ndvq1","&gt;A better analogy is that GE sells a universal constructor that is restricted by its software from making anything that GE doesn't think you should be able to make. Like more universal constructors.

That's a terrible analogy, and quite frankly: You've missed the whole point. I'll fix it for you:

&gt;A better analogy is that GE sells a universal constructor that is very powerful, but unfortunately rather unfriendly to users who have not been educated in it's use. Understanding that the constructor, while powerful, will ultimately be ignored by the vast majority of the market that it is attempting to enter, they wrote software that made the entire package incredibly user friendly but ultimately limited in the scope of it's construction.

It's not that hard. 

It's a highly user friendly, very simple to use media consumption device aimed directly at the non-technical masses. 

Find me one company that is creating a competitive phone or tablet that understands the fundamental mantra that Apple follows: ""It's not about the specs. It's about the _feel_ of the device. It's about the logical simplicity of the interface, and the seamless bridge between hardware and software. That anyone can pick a device up and understand it in minutes, be they a child, a geek, or a senior""

EDIT: You're welcome to try. Android certainly isn't it. Most of the competing tablets completely miss the point. They pack in the hardware for better specs (knowing that Gizmodo will inevitably make a trite graph explaining all the spec differences while simultaneously failing to describe anything about the devices) and then just load on what, Windows 7?

No other company understands the absolute benefit of having control over the software and the hardware. It's not about having the best hardware or the best software. It's about having the absolute best integration of both. And quite frankly, only Apple gives a shit about that. The rest are hardware companies copy pasting an OS onto their device, or software companies desperately trying to make software that covers forty million types of hardware, but ultimately always failing to deliver a unified, coherent, and seamless bridge.

"c0n08qx","it's complicated, because you are right and I am right too...there are elements of both to every interaction.  

There's two parts to my response.  First off, are you sure that beauty has nothing to do with friendship?  I dunno about you, but I am definitely more drawn to physically attractive men and women both when it comes to friendship.  It's human nature to want to associate with high value people, and our value has a lot to do with our desirability, even if you aren't trying for anything sexual.  You'd rather be seen in an attractive group than an unattractive group.  So first off I question the premise that approaching an attractive person for friendship is so unrealistic.

But secondly - what approach are we thinking of?  There are approaches which are clearly flirting - going to the woman at the bar and asking her what she's drinking, etc.  But what about an offhanded comment to whichever stranger happens to be next to you at the dollar store, looking in the freezer section, about how their selection of frozen goods always sucks?  I name that one because a guy came up to me and said that to me in the dollar store and I completely took it at face value - I thought he was just making a friendly passing comment to whoever happened to be nearby at the time.  I made a joke back about what do you expect at the dollar store, but hey these ice cream bites actually look pretty good compared to what they usually have.  But then when that little blip of conversation was over, he said to me ""So....how was your day today?""  And only THEN did a light bulb go on in my head, ""Oh he's trying to hit on me!""  I totally had missed it before that point.  Why?  Because his excuse to talk to me was believable and good, and I'd taken it at face value.  But this ""How was your day?"" to a stranger was too contrived, so I saw through it.  

Point being, in a more relaxed setting like a club or bar, and armed with a good wit (and preferably no magic tricks, dear god), why couldn't you find some excuse in what's going on to strike up an innocent conversation?  ""When does the kitchen close?  Have you ordered their food before, is it scary bar food or is it edible?  Hey can you watch my seat for a second I need to go check on my friend inside.  Hey thanks for watching it - haha you totally missed it though, there was this whatever thing that just happened inside when I went to go get my friend, it was crazy!""  etc etc.

Even easier is if you go out with a group, and it's one of those loosely connected groups where everyone brought a friend of a friend of a friend, so you're introduced to a dozen people you've never met but who are now part of your group...talking and being friendly and finding out who they know or how they know the rest of the group, etc, is easy and friendly, and can be done whether or not you want to sleep with the person.

I just reread what I said and realized I'm kind of missing the point - the point is, that although yeah the person you are talking to may have met your minimum requirements for attractiveness just based on you sizing them up at a glance and deciding to show interest in them.  But are those your only standards?  Don't you also need to know who she is as a person, too, before you decide whether you are just being friendly and getting to know her, vs actually pursuing her?  The start of this thread was about how women aren't so likely to reject you upon approach if you come off like you're just being friendly.  But the point I'm making now is, that even if she knows that you've checked her out, you also want to convey that just because you found her attractive enough to approach doesn't automatically mean that you are interested in her yet - she's got to prove that she's a worthwhile person first.  So you chat, or you flirt, or you do whatever is your style when interacting, but you're not sold on her yet because you don't know her yet.  It's not that you're trying to come across like ""Oh I only want a friend, of course I have no interest in you!"".  It's just that you haven't decided yet either way - all possibilities are open, but for now you're just interacting, just getting to know each other, and its not just a matter of convincing her to like you...it's very much also a matter of her convincing YOU to like HER.  Its a two way street.  Women often are defensive against guys who come on too strong too quickly because it's not a two way street - those guys are clearly just trying to win her favor.  Women prefer a man who has higher standards than that, who she needs to win over by proving herself to be a worthwhile person as WELL as attractive, throughout the interaction.  And that kind of a two way interaction, where you start out with both parties at least interested enough to talk, but neither one convinced that they want the other person - those interactions can end in many ways, either in a romance, or in a new friend, or in just a friendly alliance for the evening.  The simple fact of talking to someone shouldn't rule any of the above out, if you do it right.",1269703538,"even easier is if you go out with a group, and it's one of those loosely connected groups where everyone brought a friend of a friend of a friend, so you're introduced to a dozen people you've never met but who are now part of your group...talking and being friendly and finding out who they know or how they know the rest of the group, etc, is easy and friendly, and can be done whether or not you want to sleep with the person.","friendly and finding","friendly",NA,FALSE,"easy and friendly","easy",NA,NA,0

Nothing.

My girlfriend is very afraid of connecting with my family. My mom loves my gf, and respects her quirks. The problem is, my girlfriend will never say anything to my mom. If something is wrong, she will try to stomach it. If my mom asks ""can I help you with X"" or ""I'm going to Y to buy some Z do you want to come along"" or ""Should I get you anything while I am at Y"" my gf always replies that she is fine in the most polite way possible. My girlfriend thinks this is polite and friendly, but to my mom, this is cold and calculated. For my mom this is like talking to a wall. Even if you are polite and nice, you can still annoy people. 

A good example of this is my moms cooking. My gf is a vegetarian, and my family can devour a small cow if we would have one. My mother prepares something especially for my gf (which is based on what we eat most of the times) She tries out new recipes and sometimes puts alot of effort into it. She does it with joy, because she sometimes just wants to do something nice. The problem is, when my mom asks if it is any good, my gf always replies ""very tasty"" or ""that was good"" etc etc...

After having said the same praise for every meal (even bad ones), my mom doesn't know anything, since my girlfriends words are empty. Its like trying to bs your way out of a situation you don't care about, or dont know anything about (to my mom)

It is like my girlfriend forgets the difference between asking and demanding. *(if you are reading this, yes, it is perfectly acceptable to ask my parents to pick you up at the airport when your parents are in a different country, it is snowing, busses aren't driving, and the airport is 15 minutes away from my house)*

Anyways, the difference stems from our two families being different. We are dutch (hence a bit more extrovert) and we have a larger family. If you don't ask for something, you wont get what you want. At her place you must read the feelings of others, and if you don't, you are probably insulting someone. 

I have had similar problems with her parents. Example; they have a relative that smokes more than a pack a day. I said that that relative smoked alot. Then my girlfriends mother asks me ""Doesn't your mother smoke alot too"" I reply ""well, she used to, but now she has cut back to 2 packs a week"". Two days later, I find out that I insulted my girlfriends mom, by suggesting said family member ... smokes (I still don't know what the problem is) and that the question about my mom was supposed to be a snappy insult in response to mine. Apparently I ruined it, without them but even twitching a facial muscle indicating that I did. How did I find out?, through my gf, because after two days of keeping this anger inside, her mom became somewhat mad at my gf for that thing I said two days earlier.

Toyota 4runner (diesel) delivered to door of hotel first morning. It was brand new and never gave us an ounce of problems. And it's a good thing. We drove all over the country. We planned our routes and drove like mad men - didn't have much trouble. Got a little lost sometimes, but nothing major. Used our limited spanish when we got in any jams and that worked great.
First from San Jose to La Fortuna (stayed at the Arenal Lodge - breathtaking). Tabacon hot springs were pretty cool - go at night!
Left rain forest area for west coast, through liberia to Playa Del Coco. Stayed at Ocotal Beach Resort - but not in the hotel, in a bungalow on the hill - it was one of the coolest places I've ever been. 
No Surfing on the beach, but Witch's Rock and Ollie's point are relatively close by boat. Go to Father Roosters on the beach below the resort - beautiful setting and great margaritas, cold imperial or whatever, food was awesome too and shared a little with the local raccoons. 
Next was Tamarindo which was the biggest let down. Surf was fun and friendly, but the town sucks my a$$. Dudes smoking coke and crack on the beach, tons of stuff stolen there all the time, heard some bad stories but we were fine. My buddy got his flip flops stolen during a sunrise set we surfed, but mine were safe (I buried them), who knows, they maybe just didn't have time to dig them up.
Last stop was Nosara, which absolutely rocked. More remote, but tons of ex-pats and english speaking people. We stayed at Casa Romantica, was so-so, but right off the beach at Playa Guiones.

Don't ever leave anything in the car unattended. DO NOT IGNORE THAT WARNING! We NEVER left the car alone when it had anything in it. If you are traveling from a to b - leave someone with the vehicle at all times. ONe of their favourite tricks is to sabatoge the tire when you go into a gas station, giving you a slow leak, then when you finally are flat down the road, a car load of locals stops to ""help you out"". As they fix the tire and distract you, they relieve you all of the contents of your car. Theft is a MAJOR issue there, so don't let anything out of your site, or even out of reach while you're sitting down to eat. Don't put a purse on table at streetfront cafe or you will likely lose it to a snatcher. The best rule I can suggest for most foreign countries is this: If they offer to help, turn it down, if they help when you ask them, you're probably ok.

"c0krl0u","Sure. 
A little background first. As you know, before 1920, there was no Turkey, but the Ottoman Empire, which was very powerful around 15 and 16th centuries but was declining since and at the beginning of the 20th century it was waiting to be obliterated for good. After the First WW, most of the land was divided between the victorious countries and a General named Mustafa Kemal started a resistance and in 3 years the war against invaders was won and the republic was founded. 
One of the most important principals the new republic had was secularism. Mustafa Kemal (Ataturk) was a brilliant man and was an atheist - or agnostic at best - and he specifically said that he left no dogma, no guideline no rules to follow when he was gone, but reason and science. 

Despite this clear request/advice/order, the governments that came after Ataturk passed away abused the system and the Ataturk Principals to bash groups/people who criticised the system. This lead to a group of elites that controlled the state for most of the part. A few times, populist leaders were elected, but whenever someone tried to fix-or change one of the original principals of the 1920 revolution, there was a military coup. Don't get me wrong, there were times that the extreme right gained power and tried to direct the country towards a ""friendly islamist"" state. These governments tried to get rid of secularism and their parties were either shut down by the high court or there were executions for treason. The elite took measures to make sure the islamist common man did not work in certain government and state institiutions, especially the army. 

In short there always has been a conservative, islamist population which was not particularly under pressure but was unofficially shunned away. 

In the 90's an islamist right wing party formed a coalition with another right wing party (which was not particularly an islamist party) and then we started seeing religious figures, cult leaders etc in the house of the head of the republic. Then a semi-coup happened and the government dissolved, the islamist party was shut down on the basis that they were the centre of anti-secular activites. 

When 2002 came, the offspring of the Islamist party that was shut down came to power with one of the biggest majority of votes in the republics history (around 47%). Most of the members were former members of the old islamist party and the only difference seemed to be that they did not have a pronounced islamic agenda like the old one. 

This party however proved to be one of the worst governments that came to power. First of all they infiltrated all government and municipal institutions. They did all sorts of cons like gerrymandering, manipulating the outcome of the elections (by stealing votes - we still use paper votes which are put into a box and are counted manually. There were bags of votes found a few weeks after the election in a dumpster, some were burned etc. ). The worst thing they did though was to create a fictitious organization called ""ergenekon"" and started arresting critics claiming they were part of this anti-republic and anti-government organization which was involved in counter-guerilla activities. The people who were arrested though are journalists, university deans, writers, retired generals. There are people who are in prison for about a year now and it is still not clear what they are charged with. No specific accusations whatsoever. 

A few days ago, a district attorney who was looking into the illegal activies of one of the biggest cults called Ismailaga was arrested by the orders of another district attorney. The accusation? The DA supposedly ordered some people to plant illegal weapons in cult safe houses so he could frame them and lock them away. Highly unlikely if you ask me. The DA's investigation apparently met a lot of obstacles from start. The safe houses that he would search for illegal activities, were searched before by the DA's of other areas so when they arrived it was all clean. His list of suspects was about 500 people (including the mayor of Istanbul) but his investigation was taken away from him on a technicality and the list of suspects declined to about 10. 

All this political conspiracies and the real problems that every country has (unemployment, inflation, healthcare, social rights etc) are either ignored or hushed. Take for example the protest of the workers of Tekel (the government owned company that regulates tobacco and alcohol sales - they also produce alcoholic drinks and cigarettes) that has been going on for 2 months. The company was (among many of the other government owned institutions and companies) sold to private investors and the workers were given an option to either leave, or continue to work on a salary which was half of what they were receiving previously. The unemployment rate among youth is about 25%. Inflation is around 11%. Our foreign debt is around 500 billion dollars (80% percent of the GDP). 

And the reason I said the culture is closer to Middle East, is that the people does not act to change this. The current government was re-elected in 2007. They are losing votes but they still are around 38% in polls, which is more than enough to be the biggest party in Parliament. When a government screws up in Western Europe, they are not elected for another term. When a government fails to meet their promises, they are not elected for another term. In turkey we have a government that not only failed on its promises and screwed up most of what was doing OK, but was elected for a second term. And they did this by playing to the religious soft tummy of the public. 

Don't get me wrong, there definitely are a lot of people who deserve to live in a country which has the same living standards of say Sweden or Germany or France. They unfortunately are the minority. The majority of the country is made up nice, friendly but naive people.

"c0kk98e","No, that is an *alternative* to redirection.  Sometimes CSS media queries are a good solution for mobile devices, sometimes they aren't.  It depends on the circumstances.

For example, there are plenty of sites where the normal pages are far heavier in terms of markup than will work well for a mobile site.  CSS media queries won't make the markup magically smaller and faster to download.

Generally speaking, you should use CSS media queries to optimise the layout, and redirect if you feel it is necessary to optimise the content as well.  Using CSS media queries to serve a mobile stylesheet is a good *first step* for making a site mobile-friendly, but other techniques may be necessary for the best experience.

The iPhone is by no means the only device that supports CSS media queries.  Any mobile WebKit browser will do it - that means Android, WebOS and Symbian/S60 devices.  Opera Mobile supports CSS media queries as well, this is popular on platforms where the default browser is junk (e.g. BlackBerry).  When you take into account the use patterns of these devices (e.g. iPhone users surf the web a hell of a lot more than BlackBerry users), you'll find that the vast majority of mobile visitors to a typical website are using something that supports CSS media queries.

In America, sales sorta ruined being friendly. People found out sell yourself and you can sell anything. This certainly holds true,because I sold pointless warranties to people in retail. I just convinced them they needed it, by convincing them to believe me. 

Some people blame it on the individual comes before the community ideal in America. My sociology professor was discussing this with the class. How the community isn't really there. You can't be friendly to the cashier, because people behind you will be pissed off. The cashier probably doesn't give a shit about you and so on.

"c0jm77y","Stargate Universe isn't giving me the feeling of the show occurring in the, well, *Stargate universe*. This doesn't have anything in particular to do with any of the major characters, species/races, or technologies involved—SG-1 and Atlantis basically had as much in common there as Universe does with either—but rather has to do with the *themes* the show explores.

Both SG-1 and Atlantis can be summarized as follows:

1. There are *powerful aliens*.
2. One species of powerful aliens, the *parasites*, have evolved in a way that makes them look at other species in the galaxy as below them. They aren't *too* much more powerful than other species (they can beat anyone in a one-to-one fight, but they aren't invincible in an enemy camp), so instead, they dominate the galaxy through a sustained campaign of fear and ignorance.
4. There are also *human aliens*, who are considered to be ""owned"" (as cattle or slaves) by the parasites. If the human aliens could be educated about the aliens' nature, and rallied into actually fighting them, they would win.
5. Finally, there are benevolent powerful aliens—basically, all other alien species that are neither humans nor parasites are helpful and friendly, but have not chosen to stop the parasites' domination of the human aliens, despite having been around much longer than either the humans or the parasites.
5. Humans from Earth take upon themselves the ""responsibility"" of rallying the human-like aliens, and convincing the benevolent aliens to help them in this quest.
6. Through their various maneuvers, the humans from Earth convince the parasites that humans can hold power greater than theirs, and the parasites begin to change the way they see humanity. (Also, lots of them die horribly first.)

It's not that I want to see another show with *exactly* this formula—but that's what Stargate means to me. If you didn't tell me SGU was a Stargate show, and I picked up a random five minutes of footage from it, I wouldn't guess ""Stargate."" Interesting sci-fi things like water dust creatures are A-OK for individual episodes, but they can't talk, and they certainly can't establish complex social dominance/submission hierarchies with humans.

"c0j979u","So, I have this good (online) friend that has been studying to be a police officer.

Really nice guy. But we know each other mostly from online. Once a year we meet. We belong to the same online gaming community.

So, we are at a meet-up and we are playing rock band and some kid (the son of a friend of mine) had told me that when a certain thing comes on the screen you are supposed to scream ""star power"". I have no idea what that means.

So, we are playing. This guy has the microphone. The ""thing"" comes up and he isn't doing anything. I'm jumping up next to him and scream ""star power"" into his microphone. He freaks out because I'm coming from behind and he didn't notice me. He gets mad instantly. Tells me to never do that again and he was very angry.

OK, I scared him. Maybe I shouldn't have done that. Fine. But I was trying to help him play the game. He later apologized for overreacting.

But then I got to think. I love the guy, but seriously, that is not the type of reaction I would have wanted from someone that i'm going to meet in a scary situation. i want a police officer that is calm and on top of things. Not a guy that is going to freak out and tase me because things get loud and unexpected.

What type of screening are they using for police officers? Like I said, I love this guy. But while playing a video game in friendly circumstances I experience something which makes me think he shouldn't be a police officer.

"c0j6q13","Just cherrypicking...

&gt; 3.) source and translation of text

Agree, Biblegateway is nice. I like the ability to allude to [a passage](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew%2025&amp;version=NIV) without having to quote it all, but leave the option to read it (and in longer context.)

The NIV is super readable and friendly, but flawed in a couple of important ways. The ESV, from what I've seen of it, is as good as any. Personally I tend to quote mostly from the NKJV (with pretentious Greek snippets from time to time) but if we want to start each discussion from a consistent place the ESV is fine by me.

&gt; 4.) 'apocryphal' books 
 
Tobit is a great story and sheds light on a few odd things that pop up in the Gospels. 1 Maccabees makes sense of some of the Hellenism in the Gospels (and explains Hanukkah). And there are some good bits in the rest of the longer-canon books. But none of them is really central to any dogma I know of. I'd be inclined to focus on the Gospels, then the Epistles and the Prophets, or sections thereof anyway.

&gt; 5.) choice of books, reading order:   

I'd say either John or Luke. John gets you right into the cool stuff from the get-go, though around ch. 16 it slows way down. Plenty of rich stuff, but you can tell the Evangelist is dictating without notes; it could be a long slog. Luke, I think, is the neglected Gospel. Matthew comes first, and has so many well-known passages; Luke's versions of the same sayings seem to end up more often in footnotes. It might be illuminating to do Luke first and see what verses we've all never underlined between the Annunciation and the Prodigal Son :-)

&gt; 6.) source(s) of opening/introduction/background  

No opinion. It might be interesting to follow up the first intro/background post with alternates. If anybody wants to argue provenance or authorship or whatever, it can go in its own thread. Hopefully with good moderation we can point wayward posters to the thread where their concern is being discussed.

&gt; 10.) how to moderate:   

I hate to be intrusive, but some mild correction is a good thing from time to time. I'd rather be admonished or told my contributions would be more on-topic in *that* thread, than just have my posts vanish till I get banned.

For my sins I help moderate the [Orthodox Convert list](http://groups.yahoo.com/group/orthodox-convert/) on Yahoo.

"c0j1e8q","In my experience exes can remain very *friendly* but usually cannot remain as any form of true close ""friends"". 

I am on good terms with plenty of my exes. I occasionally hear from them, I always wish them well, they know they can talk to me if they ever need something and I will always be there for them - and they are the same way for me and have been there to talk if I ever wanted it. I would consider that very friendly but not really good ""friends"". I don't hang out or talk to them very often.

"c0ismqd","I worked on this exact campaign last year in FL, and had a lot of success organizing with local educators' unions - and not just higher ed, either. *Everyone* is facing budget cuts, but unfortunately folks are initially more likely to fight for their little piece of that education pie than stand in solidarity demanding real solutions. If you can break through that barrier, you'll find you've got more motivated individuals ready to throw down than you've ever imagined possible. 

After that, the most important thing is building and sustaining momentum. Fact is - and this is especially true with students - if something is not engaging, participatory, and, above all, exciting, people are not going to stick around. This means that somewhere along the line you're going to have to take risks. Be smart about it, and always plan three steps ahead - your mantra: build momentum, build momentum. Too big of a risk too fast and you've lost it. Beware the ultimate college movement momentum killer, summer break, and try to incorporate it into your plans. 

In the course of your campaign you'll probably need to single out some politicians and administrators for their less enlightened points of view. I wish this wasn't the case, but god damnit if it isn't easier to get people riled up when there's a figurehead to be mad at. This man/woman is not really your enemy; more like an unwitting partner in your activist scheme. Your job: make them slip up, over react, misspeak, god forbid arrest some innocent protester. Exploit the poor soul mercilessly - but of course, stay classy. This is a battle of ideas, not of personal attacks. It'll help if, while doing this, you've got someone friendly but largely unaffiliated with your movement (student government folks usually fit the bill) working on the inside to see what compromises can be made. Just be careful they're not too politically ambitious or they may try to hijack the movement and initiate processes that'll take away your momentum. Keep 90% of the focus on what's going on in the streets.

Of course, wankerbot's suggestion will be something you'll be engaging in at all points of your campaign. A fully devoted, imaginative, and skillful propaganda working group will probably be your greatest asset. Chalking and banner drops are two non-destructive ways of communicating large visual messages; do what you can get away with (Interestingly, we never had a banner drop get taken down, mostly because we had the custodial staff - and to some extent the cops - on our side ^_^). Well placed/designed, they're much more effective than hundreds of fliers. [Here's an example](http://imgur.com/rThg1) of a really simple one we hung during a die-in advertising for a larger anti-war action later in the week. We'd use rope or busted bicycle inter-tubes to tie weights (usually refilled water bottles from a nearby recycling bin) onto the four corners of a tarp like that one. Two are dropped over along with the banner, and two more and used as weights on the other side of the wall to keep it in place. Works like a charm, takes 1 min to deploy.

"c0iczjx","I recently finished doing a train trip on Amtrak from Los Angeles to New York. I took the Coast Starlight from LA to Oakland first because I wanted to catch the California Zephyr to Chicago (supposedly one of the most beautiful train trips in the US, and I can confirm this). The next leg was from Oakland (Emmeryvile Station really) on the California Zephyr to Chi-town where I caught the Lake Shore Limited out to NYC, Penn Station.

Over all it was a 5 day trek and cost approximately $250 US. If you can stomach not showering that long, snoring neighbors, and can sleep well in a seat, you don't need to opt for a sleeper car — it will almost double the price of your ticket. The seats on a lot of longer Amtrak trains will be pretty comfortable in my opinion.

The meals on Amtrak are pretty shitty, but are a slight step up from airplane food. I recommend going to your nearest Asian food market and stocking up on a bunch of goods that can be reconstituted with hot water like noodle bowls and miso soup packs (hot water is usually free from the concession car), a bag of fresh fruit, nuts/trail mix, and a bottle of your favorite poison (whiskey worked well for me).

The service on Amtrak was real hit or miss. Some of the people who worked on the train were really cool and friendly, but a lot seemed bitter and grumpy having to work the rails in cramped conditions and long hours. I got the impression that a lot of them were heavy into meth.

One other thing, if you have any electronic gear whatsoever, either make sure you get in a car that has a pair of chargers by every seat row, or get that one magic seat number 51, which will be the only one with power in certain cars — just be prepared to be woken up at 3a by people requesting to charge their cell phone.

Over all, it was an amazing experience, the scenery and experience of doing it made it really worth it, but when I got off the train in NYC, I was pretty happy to have it behind me. I love train travel in general, but 5 days is a long time and I probably won't be repeating it again any time in the near future. I would have rather broke it up a bit more with some stops.

- South California (A different country) Los Angeles is a mess. The movie industry is there, and it's a huge city. Has a lot of the same problems as New York City. If you're going to visit, hit up the major beaches nearby. They're an interesting study of the ""california life"". Mind-blowing.

- San Diego.. Lots of single 20-something women. Could not figure this one out.

- Tijuana (mexico) just over the border. Dangerous, dirty and drunk. You'll probably come back missing a kidney. If you enjoy the seedier parts of the world, this is one disaster you don't want to miss.

"c0ha0eu","Another vote for Ableton Live.

It's an incredible program. Incredible interface. Absolutely incredible for live performances, for recording, for editing/tracking, for rhythms and melody, for sampling and playing samples. Hell, you can even DJ and beatmatch and mix with it.

My main or only complaint is that it is... well... loop based. That's it's function. To be loop based. Granted you can make just about any loop in any signature in almost any combination - but it's loop based.

Granted, modern music itself is loop based, and Live is very, very flexible and friendly, but it's all too easy to let it lure you into it's hot, sticky little grids and influence your music in subtle or not so subtle ways.

But, hell. It's just one program. For one program it does damn near everything. A/B FX sends and returns, a full mixer, piano rolls, samplers, drum tracking, synths, plugins, third party FX and plugins and who knows what else. You can plug damn near any midi controller or keyboard into it and make it do whatever you want.

Or just record stuff off your mixer, mics, guitars, mouth harp, whatever and treat it as a multifunction recording, editing and tracking program and then take advantage of the drum machines and FX and whatever else.

I wouldn't master or engineer an album in it. It tends to get a bit noisy and glitchy if you get too close to the red on your levels and gain path.

If you only wanted to do straight multi-track recording of traditional/analog instruments - I wouldn't make Live my first choice. You'd probably be better off with Audacity, CoolEdit, Wavelab, SoundForge or ProTools.

But that said, the interface of Ableton Live is so great that it often makes up for any failings as a multi-track recorder.
 
Lastly - **WARNING** - it can be dangerous or difficult to ""preview"" the program. I knew someone that tried it before buying it and it phoned home to check to make sure it wasn't, err, borrowed - and it deleted all of the MP3 and WAV files on his drive.

&gt;what is your take on (1) the ITER

I'm a fan.  Basically, the name of the game in this type of research is trade-offs.  Achieving more efficient magnetic confinement necessarily means a more complex (and therefore more expensive) machine.

The short version is, every form of power production has strengths and weaknesses, and any responsible energy policy will account for many types of production (yes, even fossil fuels).  With fossil fuels, you have dwindling resources and environmental impact, but on the other hand it's got high energy density, is known technology, and (most importantly) is easily miniaturizable.  Solar or wind are eco-friendly, but limited in scope by the climate of the region where they are built.  Fusion has cheap fuel and is clean and powerful, but the tradeoff is the reactors require a very large initial investment (as opposed to, say, a petroleum-fired plant, which is cheaper to build but will in the long run have more expensive fuel costs).  In this light, the goal of fusion power research is to find the ""golden medium"" between efficient confinement and minimizing machine complexity and cost.  

The general consensus is that tokamaks offer the best balance between efficiency and complexity.  beyond that, the cost of the machine would probably be prohibitive to use in power generation.  In that light, yes I support ITER as furthering research into tokamak design.

In particular, it's thought that a lot of power-balance problems with tokamaks are simply a question of scale - i.e., that the reactors simply aren't big enough to reach favorable balance.  As you no doubt know, ITER will be substantially larger than any existing tokamak, so hopefully it will solve some of those issues.

&gt;and (2) Polywells?

I'm not as well versed in this type of design, but to my understanding it's subject to the usual limitations of a mirror machine.  It's a clever concept, but magnetic mirror designs are extremely sensitive to MHD instabilities.  Fluid instability, plus particle scattering into the ""loss cone,"" give such a design a rather tenuous hold on confinement in general.  I've heard some interesting things about it, but even so it seems like anomalous particle losses are a little to common to make the design viable.  Even if they can get it working very efficiently (admittedly, they have reported some interesting successes), I think the only real advantage it could offer would be miniaturization.",1260735740,"solar or wind are eco-friendly, but limited in scope by the climate of the region where they are built.","friendly, but limited","friendly","but",TRUE,"friendly , but limited","limited",NA,NA,1

""Really, commander Xi? How wonderfully observant of you! Open a channel to everyone on the ship so I can speak to the crew.

Ehem. Dear friends. Today mankind stands on the threshold towards a new kind of future. For centuries we have prophecy this moment and today we are the fortunate ones to see our dreams in full blooms. Rejoice, comrades, in our past advances that brought us here.

"c0grp4t","Hi!  I'm back home now after spending a year in New York.  It was an awesome experience.  A few things I wish people had told me (native New Yorkers feel free to contradict as needed)--

1.  Start looking now for a room in an apartment.  If you really need to pay &lt;$600, resign yourself to living a solid (20-30 min and up) subway ride away from downtown Manhattan.  If you do live in Manhattan, Spanish Harlem is very shady, and parts of Washington Heights are too (though other parts of Washington Heights are quite nice).  Always check out a place in person, or have someone you trust do so, and get input from a New Yorker as well.  Above all, START LOOKING NOW.  I got a temporary place through craigslist, then once I was there it took me 80 emails, to set up 9 interviews, to finally get a room in a place.  It was not uncommon for me to be one of twenty people interviewing.  And I considered myself lucky.  You'll probably have an easier time since you're female (many craigslist ads in the city are ""female only""), but consider yourself warned.

2.  Network.  Everybody knows someone who knows someone in NYC.  And New Yorkers are very friendly and helpful to people looking to move to the city.  This reddit post is a fabulous idea; keep thinking this way.

3.  It looks from your post like you're planning to visit first.  Do this, and do your damnedest to line up an apartment when you do.

4.  Unless you're planning on living in Jersey (and I've heard great things about Hoboken--for reals) don't bring your car.  You will have to pay insane amounts for parking or have an amazingly flexible work schedule that will allow you to move it often enough to avoid parking tickets.  I tried the second approach and eventually just ended up selling the damn thing after $250 in tickets.  If you don't land in Jersey, don't bring your car.

5.  There are cultural differences, but they stem more from the realities of living in the city than from the people.  New Yorkers are actually very friendly, but it's a tough city.  Little things that you take for granted are *difficult* in NYC.  For instance, I had never in my life thought twice about doing laundry, until the day I had one day off in 13, and had to spend that day humping my clothes three city blocks through driving sleet to the laundromat.  Doing laundry, getting to work, even taking out the garbage is harder in NYC.

6.  This is a good thing.  New York is a tough town, and that's part of what makes it awesome.

7.  Keep a close eye on your finances.  New York is just expensive, and that can take some getting used to.  Watch your bank accounts/credit cards.

8.  Don't forget why you came in the first place.  Free Fridays at MOMA, picnicking in Central Park, planning your run so you can see the Statue of Liberty, various ways to see cheap plays/art/musicals, and on and on.  It can be easy to get myopic and switch to survival mode once you're there, especially if things go badly at work.  Remember every now and then to take advantage of this time that you'll remember for the rest of your life!

For a year I struggle.  I date mostly online.  I scare and creep out a lot of women.

Then I decide out of desperation I really need to get my shit together because I'm getting no real fast, becoming increasingly desperate, and quite frankly, I'd really love to get laid and have a nice girlfriend to call my own.

So I comb the internet for help, search for book suggestions, etc, etc...someone recommends The Game.  It sounds silly, but then another friend vouches for it, so eh, whatever.  I buy a copy.

And wouldn't you know it, I found it to be a very entertaining book.  But the advice!  It was REAL *practical* advice.  None of this ""think positive"" bullshit.  It was more like ""Here's exactly what you say to them"".  I really can't express to you how happy I was to not have someone tell me the same sorry stupid stuff on how to speak with women, but I felt like I was getting to the end of my rope.  Dating really is one of those areas where there it is almost impossible to find help if you're clueless.  

Here are what I consider to be the most important things the book taught me:

--The powers of a well told story.  If you learn to tell the same handful of stories really well you'll always have something to fill those awkward silences with.  Also, they make a girl feel closer to you.

--  Qualifying HER instead of sitting there feeling like you're the one being judged.  You're the fucking man, so act like it!  Why is she so special that you have to feel nervous?  You're awesome, and you need to see she meets your qualifications before you can date her.  So show it.  Be polite, nice, and friendly, but show it.  Ask her: Do you get along with your family?  Do you have goals?  What are they?  Do you read?  What was the last thing you read?  How are you handling your current classes and job?  And finally, the most important question of them all:  *Are you a happy person?*

-- Style, dress, posture....these things are important.  A basic knowledge of these elements goes a LONG way.  Learn them.

--Be interesting.  Have interesting things to say.  If you ever find yourself saying ""I'm bored"", there's a problem.  You need to find a hobby.  Take dance lessons, learn karate, kayak, pick up photography, volunteer somewhere.  DO SOMETHING.  Interesting people that do interesting things ooze charisma and will always have more to say.    

--Always be wearing a smile.  Or at least a smirk.  

--Effective courtship lies in making women want you, not in trying to swoon women by telling them how much you want them.  Compliments do more harm than good early on.

People will say bad things about The Game because there is some bad advice in there.  That is to be expected when you read a book about a variety of characters who all teach the same thing but with different styles and philosophies on the subject.  Mystery will teach you how to pick up sluts in a club while David DeAngelo will teach people how to pick up whoever you want in the grocery store.  So you pick up the advice you like, leave the rest on the table, and enjoy the story.

This is running on a bit long...but if you're having a hard time with women and can't find anyone to give you advice worth a damn, pick it up.  It really did me a lot of good and at its core it has a good message.  People often get distracted by a lot of the raunchier/sleazier things in the book but it's necessary to include such lurid details when you write a story about what's really important when it comes to relationships between men and women.

A lot of people will have you believe the book is only for those looking to date club trash.  That is not true.  For the record, I have a girlfriend and I credit the book for us being together.  She is 24, in great shape, a redhead, is hit on regularly by other guys, makes about twice as much money as I do, holds two degrees, and loves baking me pumpkin cookies.  We've been together two years now.

Don't ever let anyone discourage you from improving yourself, and if you ever need any help with this whole dating thing feel free to send me a message!

We have run into each other a couple times, and it's been polite and friendly, but that's not why I've been avoiding her.

I also handled the breakup poorly, basically saying I'd do anything to keep her, not realizing that she was simply done with me.  I feel like she has the upper hand in things now because she was able to walk away from me but I wasn't able to let go of her.  

I guess I'm trying to say that being around her sets off a chain reaction of pain and bad memories so I've avoided situations where I might see her, which has meant avoiding some of my friends.

"c0e36ib","Back in March I was committed for a week.  It was terrible the first few nights; I missed my son terribly and felt guilty for being there.  My roommate tried to kill herself, so they put her in her own room at night with a bolted down bed and no blankets or pillows or sockets or switches.  So I had my own room, which was cool. 

Most of the people there were addicts, which is not why I was there, so it was hard relating to the other patients.  The day nurses and staff were professional and friendly, but the night nurses were demons.  I  locked horns with one of them, and then I declared outright war on her because she was so evil.  One night she wouldn't let me shut my door, which made the light from outside stream in and blind me.  So I moved to my roommate's empty bed on the dark side of the room.  She came in, I had my back to her, and she yelled, ""What are you doing?  This isn't even your bed!""  I replied, ""I know,"" and kept laying there.  She left, and I heard her bitch about me to the other nurses at the desk.

The hardest part for me was the banality of it all.  The day group sessions were pointless and addressed no real issues.  The private counseling was patronizing at best.  I needed aggressive, real care.  When I pointed this out to my psychiatrist (who would come see me every morning for 10 minutes) he said the facility I was in was more of a ""stabilization"" facility, not really a place to see much marked improvement.

"c0c2z5f","Did you also live in Kitsilano? I find it amazing how many francophones live in that neighbourhood. I'd say that Montreal and Vancouver are pretty different. Vancouver's very naturally beautiful and I like the way the downtown architecture interacts visually but it's pretty culturally vacuous. Montreal has a strong culture and is more urban/dingy (excepting east hastings, obviously) none of the buildings really gel together outside of the endless rowhouses and outdoor staircases. Vancouverites tend to be more outwardly friendly but standoffish on a personal level whereas Montrealers are more genuinely accommodating and interesting but are a bit more hesitant to interact with new people.

Why did I leave? Short answer, to see the world. Long answer, I work in film and media and while a lot of Quebecois productions get made in Montreal about 90% of what's produced there is solely for the home market and I really can't stand how insular the culture is in that respect.

"c0b4syo","i'm a girl in computer science, so i feel your pain.

i have a significant advantage in that i already have a boyfriend.  you don't mention if you have one or not but, if you do, one technique i've found that usually works pretty well is to casually mention, within the first half-hour or so of conversation, the existence of said boyfriend.  

it doesn't need to be anything gushy like ""oh my god i'm so in love"" -- if anything, that's counterproductive, because then they're thinking about you in terms of relationships.  keep it simple and it makes you seem more like just a person, but one that happens to be unavailable.  just work the word 'boyfriend' into what you're already talking about: ""yeah, my boyfriend's cat does that all the time!""  that's all you need.  just make sure to do it early, right after you meet the guy, before any ideas have time to take shape.

if you don't have a boyfriend, i'm afraid i can't give you advice to replace the above with, other than pretending you do...  but i don't recommend it, since lies will always catch up to you.  besides, they're your friends -- you don't want them drooling over you, but that doesn't mean you want to lie to them.  :(

another thing that has helped me is the reputation i have managed to cultivate.  i have a black belt and i fence (as in with swords), so i used that to get myself filed under ""friendly but dangerous and scary if provoked.""  i've never even had to smack one of the guys around, but they're a little scared of what would happen if i did.  this is amusing, since several of them are trained martial artists and bigger than me.  as much as i hate to admit it, they'd probably be able to take me if it came down to it.  the trick is to *not let them figure that out*.  :)  i'm not really sure why this works, but it seems to.

"c09ufpe","I live in California, in what is considered to be one of the best school districts in the nation. I went to elementary school for six years, then two years of middle school and two years of high school. I'm currently in community college. I don't have a lot to say about elementary and middle school because I don't remember them very well, so I'll mostly focus on my two years of high school.

In my freshman year I took English, Spanish, mathematics, physical education, biology, and drama.

My English teacher was a young man who had just entered the profession. He tried his best to make the material interesting to freshman students. Most of them didn't care. The English department dictated the assignments that he could give and the books that he would teach, which kept him from being as good a teacher as he could have been. I think the primary purpose of most of the assignments was to force students to actually read the books; while getting kids to read is a worthwhile goal, it was a shame that so much of the teacher's effort had to go into that. I found the prescribed assignments irritating, but there was nothing he could do.

My Spanish teacher was a very friendly Hispanic man who started the year by announcing that his goal in teaching the class was to prepare students for college rather than to actually teach them the Spanish language. He said that if we wanted to actually learn Spanish, there were much better ways to do it. His class was very formulaic; we followed the textbook closely and didn't actually speak very much Spanish. Still, a lot of the class had trouble.

My mathematics teacher was amazing. He had an excellent understanding of both mathematics and chemistry. He really knew the material in depth and thought carefully about how to teach it to students. I think he could have taught at the university level. His tests were notoriously tough, but he curved them. Eighty percent of the grade came from the tests; he collected homework and checked it for completeness but wasn't very picky about it. I came away with a good understanding of the concepts.

Biology was best described as ""generic"". The teacher was mostly friendly, mostly taught from the book, and mostly did an okay job. To succeed in the class, you needed to have a good memory for concepts and a tiny bit of critical thinking skills.

I enjoyed physical education and drama, but those aren't academic subjects so I won't elaborate.

In my sophomore year, I took English, History, Spanish, mathematics, physical education, chemistry, and drama.

My sophomore-year English teacher was an older woman who some people loved, but I couldn't get along with her. I think she had been in the education system so long that she no longer expected students to be intelligent or mature. Her essay assignments were extremely formulaic; she more or less dictated the structure and topic of the essay. We would get assignments like ""Choose three aspects of good government and use 'Lord of the Flies' to demonstrate why they are important. Use at least one quote from the book per paragraph."" Like in freshman year, much of the teacher's effort went to making sure people were actually reading the books. She was kind and friendly but I couldn't stand her teaching style, so I don't have fond memories of her class.

My History teacher was similar to my English teacher, perhaps because they worked together. Class consisted of lectures (usually on Powerpoint), sometimes discussions, and generic assignments and tests. One of the most interesting things she did was try to teach the class geography by making us label maps and then later quizzing us on them; her effort went surprisingly well, but it really should have been taught years earlier. We also had the occasional class activity to teach us about a historical event; usually these were a little bit interesting but not very educational. Probably the best one was a war game to teach about WWI, which my side won because the teacher didn't understand the rules. I didn't get a whole lot out of her class.

For Spanish and mathematics, I had the same teachers as in the previous year. Not very much changed. One of the rules for second-year Spanish was that 80% of the discussion was supposed to be conducted in Spanish, but my teacher only followed that rule when other teachers were visiting.

My chemistry course was taught well but not impressively so. The labs were enjoyable, the tests were a little bit hard, and the teacher was charismatic and interesting. The highlight of the year was receiving bonus points for participating in a local engineering competition. However, the teacher didn't seem to understand the material in nearly as much depth as I would have liked; he wasn't able to answer tough questions. I learned a lot in that class, but I think it could have been done better.

A common feature of all of my academic classes was that the teachers had to cater to students who didn't really want to be there or had trouble understanding the material. Students who didn't want to be there wasted the teachers' time, and students who had trouble meant that the teachers couldn't really cover the material in depth. Some of the students could have gotten a lot more out of the same class time if the teacher had been willing to teach in more depth, but then the average students would have been left behind. My chemistry and math courses were 'honors' courses, so the problem wasn't as bad in those courses.

I'm not really sure what could be done to improve the educational system, but I have a couple of ideas. First, teacher salaries should be higher. If teaching payed well, then it would attract teachers that understood the material better and cared about it more strongly. Second, literary analysis should not be taught in middle school or high school. The main reason why students had so much trouble writing essays is that they were unable to effectively analyze the books in the first place, and with disorganized thoughts they had no chance of writing an organized essay. I believe that many of the students in my class could have become better writers if they had been allowed to practice writing on topics that they understood thoroughly.",1243397044,"she was kind and friendly but i couldn't stand her teaching style, so i don't have fond memories of her class.","kind and friendly","friendly",NA,FALSE,"kind and friendly","kind",NA,NA,0

Sorry to be a pill, but this applies to every single American airline I've ever flown in the past 10 years.  Continental and Alaskan were tolerable, but compared to most European and Asian carriers, as well as several S. American ones I've been on, they were at best average.

"c08ysd0","5th and last part.

Q: (15.3 mins) Can you tell us a bit about the movie Big Buck Bunny, for instance, and how it was financed?

A: The movie started with a small subsidy from the Dutch Digital Pioneers, which is one of the funds semi-government, related to government, efforts to make sure that the whole knowledge economy in Holland is being supported. But most of that came from Blender Foundation, eshop revenues and user community. So when I know that I have the minimum amount, 30 or 40 thousands Euro as a backup then we announce the project: ""Ok guys, now you can buy the DVD in advance, before we even starts, and do that for like six weeks, two months, and everybody who pays for it before we starts can get their name on the credits in the movie."" And that's a thousand, eleven hundred people did that I think for Big Buck Bunny. That's a thousand times 35 E and with our own reserves is a sufficient budget to say lets go for it and make the movie.

Q: (16.5 mins) Yeah, it worked very well because you have the very long titles at the end, the credits. These are all people...

A: Yeah, people love that. You don't want to know how many complaints from people who didn't find their names in it and... So for the next time I have to do it that much more careful. At first publish the whole list so people can see if they are there. Because if you miss one person, they feel it as personnal, being hurt.

Q: (17 mins) So what if, at some point, you feel like you want to stop doing this? What happens with Blender?

A: If I stop doing this kind of thing? It works out for everything.

Q: As an Institute and Foundation with the community or would it have a different... what do you think?

A: The good thing with the Blender Institute is that the Blender Institute is not THE place that Blender is being made. It's an important place, it's a great place where people can meet, but it is not Blender. Blender is made via Blender.org, online communities, mailing lists, irc meetings (NOTE: sunday 10 EST, #blendercoders on freenode), that's where Blender is being done. And of course, I'm an organizer, I like to make bigger targets, and bigger targets and bigger targets and I like to manipulate communities in a positive way.

Q: (18 mins) What does that mean, manipulate communities in a positive way?

A: For exemple, a lot of open source networks or organisation have some kind of self confidence, arrogance about how great they are, how good they do things. But what I usually do is I'm totally down to earth, we can make fun together, we don't have to take this all too seriously. It's very relaxed. But we combine that with very ambitious targets. So you don't have to be the best of the world, don't say that, but we're gonna try it. Like a bunch of students, farmers, rednecks, whatever come together, but they are going to beat Hollywood. That feeling works very well, because it's not elitist what you do, it feels down to earth and accessible. That's what helps moving things. And for some people, it's like, they call that a benovelent dictator, I don't know if you've heard that title, a couple of open source projects work really well because that's one central key figure which can make the complicated decisions. It's tricky because if you make bad decisions, you can alienate communities and you can get forks and people doing other things. But for now, since 2002, Blender didn't really have forks and we manage to get this done together really well. That means you have to listen, to find out ""Ok, where are the issues in Blender"", try to solve them, but also try to move them. For the next open movie, we start in July. Of course then the targets are much higher, try to do *grumbling*, it has to be hollywood stuff. We have to tickle those people there. But still we will realise it with our own people. That combination is nice.

Q: Definitely

A: So without me... I can't answer that, that's an unfair question. *laughter* What do you say. Like what will your kids do when you die? You hope of course that the kids will do great, you don't want the kids to be crying all day. So it has to go on, of course they will go on.

Q: (20.2 mins) Is that what it is, is it a big Blender familly?

A: It feels a little bit sometimes like it, yeah. We're very close in (hand gestures), I don't know how to describe it. It usually works well, it's a, maybe for a little bit because of my personnality, the way I do things, being accessible, people can you, everybody can email me, it's open, friendly, but still interesting. There's a lot of fun in the Blender community. And that gives some sense of familly, or community feeling. I prefer to talk about community and not about network (wintercamp plenary flashback here). That's very abstract and cold and doesn't feel cuddly and warm. In a community you have a blacksmith and a grocery and all kinds of people having roles but they are still independant. And they are together not because they want to be a community but because they get something out of it by being a community. That's the difference.",1240191706,"it usually works well, it's a, maybe for a little bit because of my personnality, the way i do things, being accessible, people can you, everybody can email me, it's open, friendly, but still interesting.","friendly, but still","friendly","but",TRUE,"friendly , but still interesting","interesting",NA,"still",1

It's like a vicious circle: romanians won't trust gypsies, there is a lot of discrimination against them, so gypsies often can't get a job. As they can't get a job, they start to beg, to steal, increasing the antipathy of the romanian for them. What's been said is a bit harsh but it's not racist, it's just a sad reality.

Roma are of course usually open and friendly, but again it depends of which part of Romania you are in. The gap I mentioned has created two separate societies who do not mix very well.

It's hard to say that anyone is responsible, it's just these ""circle of hate"" tragedies like what's happening in the Middle-East, and because of the open borders, this circle is extending to other European countries (Italy for instance displays a scandalous treatment of the gypsies).

Roma have always been a migrating ethnicity, and since they came from India a few centuries ago, they created a nomad (bohemian) lifestyle which might now seem disconnected from the modern world (who needs craftsmen when you've got mass production ?). The fact that on one hand gypsies don't seem to fit in and on the other hand Romanians would hardly let them fit in is creating a very difficult situation.

Think of it like 6th grade. You're hanging out with some friends, and *BAM* a new kid appears who you are contractually bound to be friends with. Good times.

Most people and work environments need time to become acclimated to you. Over time they'll grow to trust and enjoy your company, but it is easy to rub people the wrong way when you begin a new job. People become eerily territorial in the corporate world. I'd suggest being friendly but reserved for the first six months.

Work harder then everyone around you. Set the bar high for your work and you'll rise quickly.

Don't fuck up. No Reddit at work, no hitting on secretaries, no late night bar confessions, no pranks on the boss, no talking back, no coming in late, and never, ever create a situation where you have to say you're sorry. I've seen people do ALL of these things and then lose their jobs.

Also, there will come a day where you understand Dilbert and The Office far too well. The interactions that you once found quaint are now annoying. You are quite sure some of your co-workers are made of pure coalesced evil. Finally, your soul will literally ache every moment you sit in your cubicle.

THIS IS NORMAL. It shows that you still have a working  heart &amp; mind. Creatures were never meant to live this way I'd suggest never becoming complacent with your job.

"c062w29","The community. 

I became aware of Linux around 1996 when I was 14. I was immediately interested from what I'd heard and read. I had only recently started to learn to program some out of curiosity and was really enjoying it. This whole business of Linux and Open Source sounded like a great opportunity to learn more. However, everything I came across on the web at that time was both intimidating and unhelpful. When looking for assistance I was treated as if someone brand new with limited knowledge was an unwelcome loser to the community when poking around the usenet.

So, being 14 and full of other interests and things to keep me busy I didn't think too much of it and quickly moved on to other things.

Once in college and getting into my 20's, open source software was a large a valuable part of my life on Windows machines. I hadn't pursued computer technology or programming at all at all in my education (BFA Performance Art, Minor in Philosophy) but still loved and admired quality software as a creative endeavor and the possibilities of technology. 

So, agreeing philosophically with free software, and enjoying it on a practical level, Linux was always in the back of my mind, but again I was busy with plenty of other things and still remembered it as an exclusive club for the anointed. It also didn't help that for a large number of these years I was constantly on the move, traveling around and so often having no computer of my own to play around on. It wasn't until last year, I was willing to give it a go again, mostly out of boredom and frustration with Windows Vista.

I was expecting the same harsh crowd but found rather that not only is the community real and open and friendly, but it's one of the best parts about being involved with free software.

Today, using Linux has reignited that old interest in programming and I've been learning Python for a start and loving it. Meanwhile, I've helped friends and family members improve their user experience with computers and have become an active member in my local Linux community (I'm in NH currently).

I love the friends I've made through software and common ideals, and I love the camaraderie involved in making something that should be large and daunting work so well for so many people.

Your Skeptical Guide to Homeopathic History, Theories, and Current Practices
Operated by Stephen Barrett, M.D.

http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/homeo.html

&gt;Samuel Hahnemann (1755-1843), a German physician, began formulating homeopathy's basic principles in the late 1700s.

&gt;Hahnemann declared that diseases represent a disturbance in the body's ability to heal itself and that only a small stimulus is needed to begin the healing process. He also claimed that chronic diseases were manifestations of a suppressed itch (psora), a kind of miasma or evil spirit. At first he used small doses of accepted medications. But later he used enormous dilutions and theorized that the smaller the dose, the more powerful the effect—a notion commonly referred to as the ""law of infinitesimals."" That, of course, is just the opposite of the dose-response relationship that pharmacologists have demonstrated.

&gt;The basis for inclusion in the Homeopathic Pharmacopeia is not modern scientific testing, but homeopathic ""provings"" conducted during the 1800s and early 1900s. The current (ninth) edition describes how more than a thousand substances are prepared for homeopathic use. It does not identify the symptoms or diseases for which homeopathic products should be used; that is decided by the practitioner (or manufacturer). The fact that substances listed in the Homeopathic Pharmacopeia are legally recognized as ""drugs"" does not mean that either the law or the FDA recognizes them as effective.

&gt;Many homeopaths maintain that certain people have a special affinity to a particular remedy (their ""constitutional remedy"") and will respond to it for a variety of ailments. Such remedies can be prescribed according to the person's ""constitutional type""—named after the corresponding remedy in a manner resembling astrologic typing. The ""Ignatia Type,"" for example, is said to be nervous and often tearful, and to dislike tobacco smoke. The typical ""Pulsatilla"" is a young woman, with blond or light-brown hair, blue eyes, and a delicate complexion, who is gentle, fearful, romantic, emotional, and friendly but shy. The ""Nux Vomica Type"" is said to be aggressive, bellicose, ambitious, and hyperactive. The ""Sulfur Type"" likes to be independent. And so on. Does this sound to you like a rational basis for diagnosis and treatment?",1222798496,"the typical ""pulsatilla"" is a young woman, with blond or light-brown hair, blue eyes, and a delicate complexion, who is gentle, fearful, romantic, emotional, and friendly but shy.","emotional, and friendly","friendly",NA,TRUE,"friendly but shy","shy",NA,NA,1

IS that enough? 

here's some good info if not,
WHAT TO DO IF...
...you are arrested by the Japanese police.

You are in for a rough time. There is no writ of Habeas Corpus in Japan, which means Japanese police can hold you for up to 23 days (3 days' initial interrogation, extendable by 10 days a maximum of twice if a judge approves. Which he will--judges rarely deny public prosecutors the privilege unless a lawyer intervenes.). There have been cases of extraction of information (signed confessions that detainees could not read) through physical and mental duress (beatings, lack of sleep and basic amenities, denial of outside communication, consular contact, or legal counsel) carried out by chain-smoking tag-team interrogators. Detention by the Japanese police is one of the larger nightmares you can experience in Japan. More on this at http://www.debito.org/TheCommunity/communityissues.html#detention

Japanese criminal law tends towards the Napoleonic (i.e. a suspect is presumed guilty, and must prove his innocence). If you do not continuously assert your innocence, you will become a pelt. Moreover, the right to remain silent (which is, by the way, guaranteed in the Japanese Constitution) will only arouse more suspicion. So answer questions, be cooperative, calm, and friendly, but DON'T SIGN ANYTHING WITHOUT LEGAL COUNSEL. Get a lawyer or suffer the consequences.

Information on how to get legal counsel (ask for the Lawyer on Duty, or touban bengoshi) from the Japan Bar Association (Nichibenren, in English):
http:// www.nichibenren.or.jp/en/index.html
http:// www.nichibenren.or.jp/en/legal/arrest_01.html
http:// www.nichibenren.or.jp/en/legal/arrest_02.html

Also, unless you are fully bilingual in Japanese, I suggest you continue to communicate in your native tongue if under a serious interrogation. Demand that you receive an interpreter. Hold out for one. For if the police feel that your Japanese is sufficient to commuicate in Japanese, they will treat you like any other Japanese suspect, language barrier or not. Don't think that speaking in pidgin Japanese is being cooperative--because there have been many cases of interrogatees being railroaded into situations without their full understanding. More on interpretation problems (in Japanese courtrooms, not police interrogations, but it is still symptomatic of the lack of balance between justice vs prosecution exigency) at
http://www.debito.org/TheCommunity/communityissues.html#courtinterp

Most importantly, DO NOT SIGN ANY CONFESSION (kyoujutsu chousho), no matter what your interrogators promise. Or you will go to jail. Confession (jihaku) equals conviction in Japan. Full stop. It will NOT be overturned later in court.

Remember that many times, these interrogations are done without arrest, as a ""voluntary investigation"" (nin'i no tori shirabe)--which means you are technically able to leave at any time. But if you just try to get up and leave before the cops' suspicions are allayed, they will just formally arrest you for the crime of Koumu'in Shikkou Bougai  (""Obstruction of a Public Official in the course of his Duties""). Time it right. But make sure you confirm whether or not you have in fact been arrested (Ask: watashi wa taiho sarete imasu ka) and on what charge (Ask: donna yougi de taiho sarete imasu ka).

Japan Times Oct. 13, 2005:  Justice system flawed by presumed guilt
Rights advocates slam interrogation without counsel, long detentions
An excellent summary from the Japan Times on what's wrong with Japan's criminal justice system:   To wit: presumption of guilt, extreme police powers of detention, jurisprudential incentives for using them, lack of transparency, records or accountability during investigation, and a successful outcome of a case hinging on arrest and conviction, not necessarily on proving guilt or innocence. This has long since reached an extreme:  almost anything that goes to trial in a Japanese criminal court results in a conviction.
http://www.debito.org/japantimes102305detentions.html

According to SUO Masayuki, director of 2007 film ""I Just Didn't Do it"" (sore de mo boku wa yatteinai) (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masayuki_Suo), the best thing to do is have a lawyer (get one, like a family doctor) contactable before you get taken into custody.  Put one on your cellphone.  You will need the support, because otherwise with the interrogative process in Japan, you will wink out from contact with the outside world for weeks at a time with nobody the wiser about what's going on, as the Suo movie demonstrates so powerfully.

Final word: the Japanese criminal justice system, with conviction rates at nearly 100%, is overwhelmingly stacked against the accused.  So don't get arrested in Japan.

"c02mufk","OK, I have to reply to this because all the arguments  of the author are pretty stupid. 

1. Ron Paul DOES want to give equal rights to minorities. Affirmative action is by definition racist and gives unequal rights to different groups based solely on race (and not say, economic status). As for the IRS crap, he wants to get rid of the IRS. I have no idea what the Brown v Board argument was about, the author provided no evidence. The citizenship thing was a peaceful way to discourage illegal immigration; it has nothing to do with race really.
2. ""Ron Paul would deny women control of their bodies and reproductive rights"" - in other news, Ron Paul wants to give more rights to unborn children. Seriously, he's obviously pro-life, no need to get bitter about it.
3. This is just stupid. States pretty much govern worker regulation anyway. As for phasing out Social Security, I'm pretty sure this is a GOOD THING. As for the Davis Bacon Act, the best I can tell is that it's unnecessarily regulating the wages of contractors. 
4. Again, this is just ridiculous. Ron Paul wants to get rid of the IRS, and it's no secret he's not fond of other taxes either. I've seen nothing to suggest this only benefits the rich though, the bill the author linked to actually looked like a pretty good bill to clean up the IRS, not to the exclusive benefit of wealthy people. 
5. Nice laundry list of things, but it's not clear if any of those are really that damaging to the environment. Like mining on federal lands. Yes, mining is not always environmentally friendly but many of the materials which make the products you use come from mines. Whether or not to allow mining on federal lands seems like splitting hairs; not all federal lands are national parks or wildlife refuges. 
6. This is the most absurd. Ron Paul wants to end wars and stop messing in the internal affairs of other countries, and that makes our national reputation WORSE? As for the UN, it's a horrible bureaucracy, do some research, please. 
7. It's no secret Ron Paul is not a fan of giving special privileges to gays or allowing activist judges to come up with gay marriage out of thin air. But he has publicly stated that the gov't should not be involved in marriages or the private lives of people. As for the federal funds thing, he's going to get rid of so much gov't spending I don't think this will even be an issue. 
8. Ron Paul supports people's right to have guns, because it's hotly debated whether gun control actually reduces crime while it's very clear that gun control keeps law-abiding citizens from protecting themselves. As for the school thing, I'm pretty sure schools are a STATE ISSUE. If a rural school wants to have a shooting range behind the school and the state allows it, why not? I think the main problem with the author is he/she thinks guns are only used for violent illegal activities, but they aren't. 
9. Having attended public school, I very much support Ron Paul's plan to get the federal gov't out of our schools. Again, schools have long been a state issue and all the federal regulation is entirely unneeded and burdensome. The author seems obsessed with segregation, but the language of the bill the author mentioned seems to clearly give choice to students and has little to do with segregation. 
10. It's no secret Ron Paul is a conservative Christian. But in all the research I've done I've seen nothing to suggest he will try to impose some kind of theocracy like the author suggests. He can't impose ""'alternative views' to evolution"" if he wants to get the federal gov't out of schools. He doesn't hate gays, even though he personally disapproves of their behavior. 

I hope that's enough for you guys to chew on; personally I would don't agree with Ron Paul 100% on abortion or religion or the environment, but I don't go around saying someone ""does not value equal rights for minorities"" when clearly the opposite is true, and saying he hate gays when he doesn't. And at times the author makes himself appear badly misinformed. Really, I have yet to see a logical, intelligent article making a case against Ron Paul. 

Even if you do disagree with him on a few issues like me, I think he's the best chance we have at a smaller and more honest government.

I'm not saying it's environmentally friendly but large vehicle ownership is more often tied to a persons job or extracurricular activitys then a need to dominate others on the road. Young guys with 4 wheel drives that have lots of chrome, lift kits, and off road tires are candadates for your small penis theory. Another group that have big gas guzzlers for no good reason are black and mexican gangster posers with their SUVs and spinners.

2. A friendly but incredibly annoying guy who likes to go out clubbing on Thursday-Saturday nights... and the come home to continue the party starting around 5am.
2. A well mannered and friendly gay guy with good taste in music. Nothing against the man, I'm just not into dudes.

"cpsup","Python's docs don't stand up to PHP's. You'd think there'd be a decent searchable object/function reference for Python online, but there isn't. Python's biggest web claim to fame is Zope, which is pretty much the polar opposite of lean-and-mean LAMP -- big app server, slow object database, inscrutable APIs, steep learning curve.

Something else about Python ... why does every Python web framework have to have its own web server, *written in Python* -- i.e. Zope, CherryPy, TurboGears, Nevow/Twisted, Django? I mean, is that a developer cop-out, an example of the FOSS problem of developers scratching the same itch, or what? That sort of thing may be developer-friendly, but real production enterprise apps have to eke out another order of magnitude or two in both the performance and stability departments.

I'm not trying to knock Python -- maybe it's better than PHP in terms of language coherence and features, although there *are* basic OO things like Java-style interfaces private/public methods that PHP got to first. But Python is a general scripting language, whereas PHP is web-optimized, and I think that's the main reason PHP's got 100 times the mindshare on the web, from glorified SSI hacking, to ECMS, and everywhere in between.",1162883065,"that sort of thing may be developer-friendly, but real production enterprise apps have to eke out another order of magnitude or two in both the performance and stability departments.","friendly, but real","friendly","but",TRUE,"friendly , but real","real",NA,NA,1
