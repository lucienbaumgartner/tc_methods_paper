"g3dk8bb","I was a very smart kid, but had no motivation at all. Tired of feeling like a loser, I decided to join the Air Force. What a difference! I walked through those doors ready to hit it, and boy, did I. During my 8 years, I achieved every promotion I could on the first try.  I received performance Awards and Medals from every base at which I was stationed. And I developed a strong sense of Patriotism to our country. Of everything I received from the USAF, I am proudest of that. 

After I left the service, my sense of motivation remained with me. My first civilian job was entry-level for a large tech company. From there, in 12 years I worked my way up to being an SVP of a Fortune 500 company. Then I worked for a small tech company, and made $1M+ when they IPO'd. (really!)

My career has been quiet but steady since then, and that's just fine with me. Being an executive fed my vanity, but was not my most satisfying job. The IPO was the singular pinnacle of my financial compensation, but not my most satisfying job either.  Most satisfying will always belong where I started, as a member of the United States Air Force.

"g3d0osi","I smiled.

In freshman year of high school, I was horribly depressed. I had terrible motivation, terrible self esteem, always looking for an opportunity to talk badly about myself. I needed ""permission"" from myself or others to enjoy things. It was bad.

Nothing helped, or could help. At that point in time I didn't have very many friends, either, due to the fact that I was a quiet but obnoxious weirdo.

But eventually, I decided to change. I didn't want to live in misery anymore, although I knew I couldn't just flip it like a switch. I needed to slowly, very slowly, start making changes.

So every time I passed myself in the mirror, I smiled. Not at myself, but at that *other* girl in the mirror. It was easier to cheer her up than it was to cheer myself up.

And ever so slowly, I began to cheer up more too.

Obviously that wasn't the only thing I did, but that was what started it all. A smile at the girl in the mirror. Now i'm in a much better place. I can genuinely say that I'm happy almost all the time. I've got great friends, lots of hobbies, and good grades. I'm going out and meeting new people, not staying holed away in my room.

"g3cx5fa","I had a socially awkward friend in high school. I tried to be nice to him because he had no friends and would spazz out. looking back, he probably was a high functioning autist. 

Anyway, he was generally chill and quiet but liked to talk about video games, and I always finished my math quick so I'd turn around and him him so we could talk about the games. 

well, one day he started talking about this new show he started watching. I immediately withdrew and stopped finishing my math so quick. The show he had begun to watch was My Little Pony.

He became a full on 'brony' and it got worse and worse. I have no idea where he is now, but the last I remember seeing was like 2 years after that class. I saw his facebook profile and it was entirely MLP shit with a self-made character as his profile pic.

"g3cnwzb","Where are you coming from?  How much time do you have?  What is your goal or intent?  There's a lot of things to do/see.  My goal was to get away, so I stayed away from most of the popular stuff.  It's very busy right now as everyone is vacationing closer to home.  Though with school starting, who knows.  

I downloaded iOverlander on my phone to find free places to sleep.  Stayed along Highway 2 a few nights.  Love the beaches along Lake Michigan.  It's awesome parking 10' from the lake and listening to the waves.  It sucks though because everything is always wet in the morning.  I have camped on Lake Michigan for like 10 years, and you can't avoid everything getting all wet.  I went to the beach and opened up the tent again to dry it out.  

If you go to Ottawa National Forest, I highly recommend the Sparrow Rapids campground.  It's free, right on the river (lots of fisherman), very nice and quiet.  But there are bears in the area.  

If you go to Copper Harbor, download a map of the Keweenaw before you go - you won't have any service.  But at the welcome center in town they have wifi.  If you decide to go to High Rock Bay, the short 7 mile drive takes an hour.  I had never been there previously, but the road was pretty rough.  I've seen YT videos of people driving big vans out there.  I'm not so sure how they'd fair right now.  I saw a guy in a new Tahoe turn around half way.  I had no problem, but I thought I was going to bottom out/scrape a bunch of times.  Didn't happen - though I will admit I don't have much off road experience.

"g3cl0fm","So I'm going to share my story, but first you should know I'm 14 and male and going into Year 10 (grade 10 in usa?). 
I lived in a very sheltered environment for the first 10 years of my life, and primary school was horrible, I had biased (possibly racist) teachers, I had no friends and I was used to loneliness and thought it was normal.
In 2015 at the age of 10, I moved to this new city, and this is where I was introduced to this new world of ""friends"". It's sounds weird but before then I had never considered trying to get friends. 
But this place was very different, I was introduced to ""bad language"" and my innocence and naivety separated me from the majority of the class, it also earned me several bullies. I hated this, and I had no clue what I was doing wrong. Then a new kid came, let's call him A, he also had moved, but from France and we connected instantly. He was my first friend and I really like having friends. I was introverted but I think that made me more ambiverted. After that I got more friends who also connected because I opened myself up more, but from my lonely past and bullying I had gotten social anxiety and was very insecure, I lied about a lot of things to seem more interesting to be around.
Then came secondary (high) school, and I was depressed. I felt like my whole friendship group was a lie. I also felt like A wasn't really my friend anymore, and it was emotionally exhausting for me to be around him, and this carried on for a year. Throughout year 7, I wasn't me anymore, I was someone else who was interesting and funny and fun to be around. Then comes year 8, and I felt that my friends didn't like the fake me either anymore, and I looked for attention and reassurance wherever I looked. I was lonely, I never saw my friends outside of school and felt left out.
Then came year 9 (this year). Our friendship group had expanded so much that some of the people who i had considered to be ""cool"" had actually taken a liking to us. At first I felt horrible, what if they didn't like me? Then I felt intimidated and honestly it's stupid, but true. I became very obnoxious and I think I was just a general asshole. But at the same time I was withdrawn from the group and lied a lot to impress the ""cool"" kids. This was definitely my lowest point.
Then I stopped talking to A, he was someone else now and I rarely saw him, and when we did talk he just didn't seem like the guy I knew years ago. This is when I became aware about how much I relied on others for happiness and I just stopped. I became very quiet but nice, not obnoxious or annoying, but I still remained in the friendship group.
Then came quarantine.
The first two months I was very depressed. I ate lots of shit and rarely went outside and hadn't seen anyone in ages. Then I get added to a groupchat. From that some of my friends - not the ""cool"" ones - organised to meet. Then again, and again, and again. Soon I realised how much I missed my friends. I chose to be honest with them and shared my insecurities and my past in primary. Soon I felt much closer with my friends and I felt that I knew them so much more. But i never stopped meeting them. I also got to know their insecurities and had many ""deep"" talks. Now I have found the motivation to work out at home, go on runs with my friends and regularly hang out. I've been really happy and felt that loneliness and sadness disappear. Exercise is honestly a key part of my current state and maybe you should try it too, if you're not already!

point was, even though this guy could may have possibly become a school shooter, there’s someone willing to bother him. i stopped bothering him eventually because i got insecure but i wish i didn’t, i knew he was a cool guy. i bet you are too. you’re gonna get judged, but some people will still appreciate you. it’s up to you if you want to change up your image.

so good thing you have friends, but if you do want to make change for a better image i suggest starting with the earbuds. i sat alone for a good chunk of freshman year listening to music until one day, i put my earbuds away and sat near a group of people. they started talking about memes then i said “i overheard you talking about memes, blah blah blah”. they’re my best friends now. they told me they were surprised and thought i was kinda weird at first but now love me and are grateful i did that weird shit. even if you suck at small talk literally talk about anything.

No one person has their own purpose. Basically we're put on this earth and you can't change that. Now that you exist you have existed. What you do with your existence ultimately serves a purpose.

Now you can either flail about meaninglessly with no direction, and the purpose of your existence will be muddied in the wake of your actions, as your goals will be indistinguishable from each individual choice.

Or you can serve a purpose that guides your actions.

So you can either serve a direction and propel yourself in that direction, or chaotically flounder like a fish out of water until you have no breath left.

It all depends on your individual characteristics which one may best suit you, but generally I find that a peaceful life is a happy life. I don't mean peaceful as in quiet, but peaceful as in not resisting life.

"g37j98c","My siblings and I are like watching a level of support gradient and it's fucking trippy. 

Me, the oldest: My parents were young when they had me so I got the brunt of the neglect and abuse. My dad resented me, couldn't tell the difference between physical abuse and discipline because of how he'd been raised, was often abusive to my mom in front of me, constantly made disparaging comments about me especially in public, and I was excluded from and actively prevented from learning any sort of basic skill on my own. The skills I did learn were behind my parents' back, and I never talked to them about any of it because they'd already destroyed my desire to practice art with their apathy or outright criticism.

I'm almost 28 and have just now gotten to a point where I'm standing on my own two feet. I still lack confidence in things most people already know how to do. I'm working a dead end job that I hate. I never went to college due to a lack of financial or emotional support. Every relationship I've had that wasn't long distance has been generally toxic or abusive, which I'm finally taking a step back and reevaluating what lead me to get into those situations and what red flags I shouldn't be brushing off in the future. I feel like I'm at a point I should have been at several years ago and I've lost so much time.

First brother: Suffered physical and emotional abuse growing up, but had the endless support of the family. He was actively taught several skills at a young age (how to save money, the value of hard work via getting paid a small amount for good grades, how to work on cars, various aspects of ranch life, ect.) Was never threatened with rent while living at home or otherwise encouraged to move out. My dad and grandparents helped him buy his first car. They encouraged him to take college classes and made the effort to do their part of the paperwork.

He still lives at home at 24. He's learned several skills that he's working on putting to use. He goes on trips out of state a few times a year and my parents don't bat an eye (my dad threatened me with rent and accused me of losing motivation and staying on his couch because I took a single week vacation to California to refresh after getting out of an abusive relationship that left me homeless. I had a decently paying job and was saving money less than a month after moving back home.)

"g37gf9c","Finding food is hard, you need to know the right way to have enough food and water to survival. Mainly, there is 3 ways on it.

1.Searching in the city

There are lots of sealed food can and water bottle you may found in the city. If you keep searching, you may have chance to survival. However, there is lots of zombies in the city too.

For this reason, you may need to know how to fight zombies. Gun is good, but it is loud, and it will attract more zombies everytime you shoot. Bow or melee is quiet, but hard to kill zombies if you are not good at it.

The other way is stealth, most of the zombie only have average sight, which means if you think yourself have a good perception, you may try to search the city at night, and left before sun rise.

This is high risk low return way to survival, which we do not recommend you to do it.

2.Hunting in the wild

Thanks to zombies do not like to move around, hiding in the wild is a good way to escape from those terrible zombies. However food is hard to find if you do not know what you are looking for.

Hunting is a good way to find food. You may want to train yourself to use bow and arrow to hunt, as ammo is near impossible to found in wild. Some melee expert will try to hunt with their hand, hoove or sword. However this will limit their food resource on boar or wolf. Remember you need to build smoking rack at soon as possible, as meat cannot keep more than a day.

The number of wild animal will recover when give them enough time, and it is not a short time. It means you need to go further and further from your base just for hunting more food when time past.

It is a tired way to survival, which we do not recommend you to do it.

3.Join and become Mycus

As you become Mycus, we will reward you a easy and infinite food resource. You do not need to worry about not enough food, you do not need to worry about water is clean or not. This is our food for you, the newcomers on Earth, Mycus fruit.

Mycus fruit is easy to found in our biospheres, easy to carry and safe to eat even you do not cook the fruit. It is tasty and make you happy everyday, as the fruit is design for our newcomers on Earth. Moreover, it will not spoiled.

As we have enough food, life is much more easier. We may choose a better way to become stronger. We may stay in the same place and read books for month, to gain enough skills to protect us from those zombies. We may go to search the city for more resource slowly, as we do not need to rush for food.

"g1x5jrp","Test depth isn't the only factor to consider when deciding if something a threat.
Here's a cool article comparing the VA class to the Akula class with some good points as to what technologies go into submarines:
https://www.naval-technology.com/features/featurebattle-of-the-submarines-akula-versus-virginia/#:~:text=The%20Virginia-class%20submarines%20have,sailing%20on%20the%20water's%20surface

If the submarine can reach that depth, there's a few ways it can be a threat.  For starters it's harder to detect submarines the deeper they are. Sound travels differently throughout the ocean based on salinity and temperature, which can change drastically at different depths around the world. Sound is one of the main ways submarines (and microphone buoys) track foreign submarines. Thermoclines can change the way sound is reflected, making submarines effectively invisible. 
https://www.google.com/amp/s/theconversation.com/amp/how-to-find-a-submarine-no-its-not-just-a-case-of-flicking-the-sonar-on-33343
Why a military would spend all of that budget on hull structure and materials to withstand massive depths instead of making a quieter submarine (like Gotland class, super quiet but fairly shallow) who knows. Usually speed and sound are much more important factors than pure depth but who knows. Any extra depth means more materials, means more money. Silence is a benefit at any depth. 
Another reason is the obvious run away/hide where the enemy submarines can't go. Thats assuming the VA class test depth (current opponent sub, info available on Wikipedia) is accurate at just barely outpacing the world freediving record.
Unless the Losharik also has weapons available at that depth it will still need to rise to a depth shallow enough to launch an attack, negating any stealth gained by being so deep.
https://www.popularmechanics.com/military/weapons/a25176/launching-missile-from-submarine/
Assuming there's no com systems able to reach 2600m they would need to rise for that too. Periscope depth is the most vulnerable time on a submarine. All it takes is one good detection for an enemy to be able to tune into that frequency and track the sub across various depths.",1597703576,"thermoclines can change the way sound is reflected, making submarines effectively invisible.  https://www.google.com/amp/s/theconversation.com/amp/how-to-find-a-submarine-no-its-not-just-a-case-of-flicking-the-sonar-on-33343 why a military would spend all of that budget on hull structure and materials to withstand massive depths instead of making a quieter submarine (like gotland class, super quiet but fairly shallow) who knows.","quiet but fairly","quiet","but",FALSE,"super quiet but fairly shallow","shallow","super","fairly",1

"g16xx5p","I pissed my pants on my first day of 1st grade. It's a long story.

I had decided to wear overalls that day. I loved them and I wanted to make a good first impression because I'd had a lot of trouble with making friends. But my wardrobe choice bit me in the ass, hard.

You see, my mom had anxiety problems so we had regular ""stranger danger"" and ""did they touch you *there*?"" conversations. It didn't take long for that to make me afraid of all adults, especially strangers.

A few hours after class started I needed to pee. We had a bathroom attached to the classroom, so I just went in, closed the door, and started unbuttoning the fasteners on my pants. At least I tried to.

Deep down I knew I'd never be able to get my pants off on my own, but I was terrified of asking my teacher for help. I'd only known her a few hours, I wasn't about to have her help me undress in a private bathroom. But still I fought, I tried everything. I even got to the point where I would've ripped them off if I'd had the strength. If only I'd had the foresight to grab a pair of scissors as I walked over to the bathroom. But I didn't...

The teacher checked on me multiple times, but I kept sending her away. Eventually my little bladder couldn't take the pressure anymore. I tried to stop the flow once the pain wasn't so bad, thinking I could buy some time and minimize the damage to my clothes, but it was so bad at that point I just completely lost control and every drop came out. By the time it was over I was soaked from the waist down and a big puddle had formed around my feet.

My fear of asking for help intensified. The good news was I didn't have to pee anymore. Mission accomplished! The bad news was I had no clue how I was gonna cover up my accidental wetting.

I grabbed some paper towels and mopped up the mess on the floor. That was easy, at least. But I couldn't reach the sink so I couldn't rinse my pants or wash my hands. I started wringing my pants out, hoping I could hide in the bathroom until everything dried up a bit. Or until class was dismissed and everyone left.

But eventually the teacher got suspicious and demanded I open the door. I couldn't stand disappointing adults, even if (and probably because) I was afraid of them, so I complied. To her credit, she did her best to keep everything calm and quiet. But she still had to walk me through the classroom and escort me to the principal's office so I could change into some dry clothes.
