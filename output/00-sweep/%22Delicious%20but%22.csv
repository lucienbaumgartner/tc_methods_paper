My whole essence of my being wanted to have another slug day today. EVERYTHING was a challenge.

Calories: 1252. Considering I was eating a buttered bagel at 7:30 this morning, this could have gone way, *way* sideways. I didn't actually set a fast last night so *technically* I didn't break early, but also... That feels like a cop out.

Steps: just under 11.5k. It's like... Really gross out here. Swampy. Had to wait until the sun started going down to get out, but not all the way down because it's just not safe to try to be athletic around here after dark. Too many multi lane roads and not enough lights.

IF: Started a 20:4 at 6:00 for a reset. So much water.

Read a chapter of something: I've been digging way into my job's bylaws and governance; does that count?

"frgo4sn","Hey there.  Sounds like you're in great shape for your first bake!  Congrats!  Take a few deep breaths and remember that it's about the journey, not the destination. :D There is almost zero chance your bake this weekend will be perfect, and that's what you're going to want, actually.  If it comes out perfect, what more do you have to look forward to?  It will be beautiful and delicious, but there WILL be improvements you can make.  Don't worry about all of them for now.  


You're plan looks perfect for the way I typically bake, and there are many recipes/plans that follow your schedule.  Nicely done.  I think the one edit I'd make is to tell you to mix by hand, rather than with the stand mixer.  There are two reasons: (1) the stand mixer is pretty rough with dough and you don't need to be that tough with wild yeast sourdough, and (2) it seems to be commonly recommended that working wit your hands is a better way to learn, because then you get to feel the dough.  Using as many of your 5 senses as possible will help you continually adjust/improve/improvise when needed.  I recommend something called the Rhubaud mixing method.  [See here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNvzM_s8dDo)!  


Finally, to answer your question on starter and levain amounts.  360 g of starter is plenty for what you need to do, but ultimately this is determined by how much bread you'd like to make.  I typically have \~110 g of starter on a daily basis, and when I'm making a levain I use some for the levain and 10 g to keep the starter going (\~half gets discarded).  Since you have 360 g starter, you could make more than triple what I make!  My levain is a 1:2:2 starter:flour:water mix.  This typically takes \~5 hours for mine to peak in volume, so I usually make my autolyse \~4 hours in.  My recipe is very close to that popularized by Joshua Weissman.  [Watch his video for a great explanation/recipe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eod5cUxAHRM)!

In recipe/schedule format (copied directly from Weissman's youtube description... all hail Josh!):

Levain: 

* 45g mature starter 
* 45g unbleached all purpose flour 
* 45 g stone ground whole wheat flour 
* 90g filtered water at room temperature 

Dough: 

* 273g unbleached bread flour  
* 500g unbleached all purpose flour 
* 175g stone ground whole wheat 
* 660g filtered water @ 90-95 degrees F 
* 180g mature levain (just use all of your levain splinter that you made seperately) 
* 18g fine sea salt   

&amp;#x200B;

Sample Schedule (just to give you an idea:)

* 9am Start Levain 
* 2:25 P.M. Begin Autolyse 
* 3:00 P.M. Mix your dough, optionally use rhubaud method. Thank you to Trevor Jay Wilson who taught me that. 
* [3:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eod5cUxAHRM&amp;t=195s) Bulk fermentation begins, peforming 2 folds spaced 15 minutes apart, and then one last fold spaced by 30 minuters after the 2nd fold. Totaling at 3 folds. Allow dough to rest for remainder of bulk fermentation. 
* 7:00P.M. Preshape your loaves. 
* 7:25 P.M. Shape your loaves and place them in their proofing baskets. Place them in plastic bags to prevent drying out, and proof them overnight in the fridge for 14-15 hours. (the next day)
* 9:00 A.M.  Preheat oven with your dutch ovens in their from cold, to get them super hot, for one hour. 
* 10:00 A.M. Optionally score, and bake your loaves.  Cool them on wire racks.

Similarly there's vacation eating, lunch with colleagues, etc. How do you manage the diet during these abnormal times and how do you deal with portion control?

Long time lurker, first time judgment-seeker (on mobile oops). This is probably petty AF but here we go. 

My BF has been in a soup-making mood recently, which I dig because it‚Äôs good soup weather. As a disclaimer, I don‚Äôt have any food allergies and I‚Äôm generally reasonably open to trying new things and he cooks far more often than I do. He says earlier today that I should wait to eat dinner until he comes home (late-ish) because he wants to try a new recipe. I‚Äôm down to clown because he was been on a roll.

He gets home, we do the whole hey baby, and he starts cooking dinner. I‚Äôm doing work in the living room and he‚Äôs working his magic on the stove.  He lets me know when everything is finished and I go into the kitchen and check out the goods. 1.) the soup looks amazing and delicious, but it‚Äôs kinda opaque I‚Äôm like huh looks fancy. But then 2 happens. 2.) I look at the kitchen sink and see it‚Äôs full of egg shells (like 7+ eggs). I ask him why there‚Äôs egg shells in the sink and he says it‚Äôs because they went in the soup. 

Here‚Äôs where it gets dicey. I do not like eggs any other way besides hidden in things that make them invisible and occasionally scrambled. I understand eggs can be made a million different ways and I have seen all the chef shows with people LOVIN eggs served in all these million ways. 

BUT there‚Äôs just something about eggs that seriously sets my mind and my tummy off of food. Like I might have enjoyed the soup if I hadn‚Äôt known there were so many eggs in the broth. But now I know. My partner knows this about me and teases me about the whole egg thing generally, but as soon as I said that I didn‚Äôt really want to eat the soup anymore he crumbled and is now super sad/not talking to me because I didn‚Äôt really want to try it or eat a whole bowl for dinner. 

I know he tried really hard to make a new recipe delicious and he wanted to share that with me. But I also feel like it‚Äôs totally within my right to not eat something that squicks me out so badly (which he theoretically might have known would bother me). It irks me that he couldn‚Äôt accept that as a reasonable reaction. 

(PS - I did try a few bites of the soup because I don‚Äôt want to be the person who never tries new things ‚Äòjust cuz‚Äô but I really didn‚Äôt like it)

There is a serious limitation in what can be effectively communicated or observed through a text based discussion forum. Even with the attachment of images, we can't really observe really useful things like pH, do a sniff test, feel for the texture and appearance of liquids across the internet. 

Even worse, many of use hold certain positions quite passionately even though we can't really assess them because we don't own a microscope and most of us don't have a significant background in professional food safety. 

Most of us have extremely poor access to useful evidence and we also lack direct experience in the field therefore food safety posts should be expected to be fraught with bad advice.

I think it would be reasonable to discuss the intent of food safety guidelines. The exercise does not require comprehensive observation of a suspicious wad of potentially delicious, but possibly dangerous meat.

"e2p5akw","Oh hi, you're me! I was also diagnosed last year, and we have the same height, previous weight, and current weight. I'm also struggling to lose weight and get back to where I was, but it's definitely a lot harder than when I used to cut calories &amp; pounds would drop off. Remember to think of your old weight/goal weight as prior to symptoms, because you may have been losing weight due to high BG (I was 106 at diagnosis, but my previous normal weight was around 116).

Anyhow, I totally feel you, and I've been thinking *a lot* on the topic... These things below have worked for me, but they are easier said/typed than done ;)

1) Count calories as well as carbs. Yes, it sucks to double the work that you already have to do before eating, but CICO is the only way to lose weight. I track in My Fitness Pal and use /r/1200isplenty for inspo. I lost 10 lbs in a few months doing 1200kcal/day not-very-strictly (then gained them back binge eating lol).

2) Hypos - Try to use the least caloric foods to treat hypos. Candy like Rockets (Can) / Smarties (US) are pure glucose. Peanut butter crackers sound delicious but high calorie. Hypo snacks count toward your calorie intake.

3) Basal - Others have mentioned this -- try to get your basal as low as possible. You want to prevent lows (to avoid treating with snacks), and, studies seem to indicate that higher basal leads to higher weight gain. I adjust my basal all the time without talking to my endo. When I'm eating healthy or working out regularly, I can use as few as 4u. When I'm being unhealthy or sedentary, it goes up to 14u. 

4) Try to plan your gym so that it brings down your spike from eating, without having to treat a low at the end of your workout. My routine is to have about 20 carbs for lunch without bolus, head to the gym for 20 min, and leave in-range. If you're eating back all the calories you burn at the gym because of the length or intensity of your workout...I guess there's still health benefits but you won't lose weight. 

5) When you're eating high carb meals, try to bolus accurately and wait out highs. This is a personal bad habit, but when I'm spiking quick after a meal, I like to over-correct to stop the spike, then treat the impending low. Obviously this just starts a rollercoaster and leads to unnecessary food consumed. 

6) This isn't a tip, but a crazy fact I only learned *this month*. Pancreas beta cells also produce a hormone called Amylin that creates the feeling of satiety. We don't have this hormone anymore. For me, sometimes I can eat and eat and even though I am painfully full, I'm still craving food. There are some drugs out there to replace Amylin and assist weight loss among T2 &amp; T1 but I don't have experience with them (yet). Symlin seems to have very bad side effects in a lot of people. I may ask my endo about Victoza next appointment.

7) If you can, try intermittent fasting or fewer meals a day. I skip breakfast which gives me stable BG until lunch, and I can eat more at dinner.",1532047259,"peanut butter crackers sound delicious but high calorie.","delicious but high","delicious","but",FALSE,"delicious but high","high",NA,NA,1
"e2e8ck8","Truth be told, first time in Epcot since I was a kid. Went with my girlfriend, and we thought two days would cover it all. Big mistake, it took us two full days to explore all the booths around the World Showcase, so we weren't able to do any workshops or seminars sadly. So if you wanna be able to do absolutely everything, 2+ days would be great. But as long as you make a list of things you HAVE to do, you can easily hit everything in one day. Coming to Epcot on a weekday will help your chances too.

Honestly, which booths in the World Showcase you wanna do is entirely up to your taste. For example, I'm Chinese-American and I didn't find the China booth's food to be all that exciting / out of the normal for me, if you catch my drift. I forgot when the Festival will start, but I'd watch TimTracker or DFBGuide for their videos on the food, so you can develop an idea of what kinds of food you want and make your to-do list from there.

Price-wise, everything ranged from 5.50 or so, to about 12-14 for the more expensive dishes. Obviously, dishes here are gonna be priced at a premium and that's entirely because it's Disney. But whether you wanna bite the hypothetical bullet and do how-ever-many dishes you want is up to you. Here's a list of my gf and I's favorites:  
1. Pop't Art at Pop Eats! - I know it's a dumb little Pop Tart thing but holy moly, it packed so much flavor and frosting inside. Absolutely delicious for something so seemingly basic.  
2. S'mores Tart and the Artist Palette Jumbo Cookie at Decadent Delights - The S'mores tart was honestly sooooo pretty and delicious to boot. But the COOKIE. Oh my god, one of the best cookie's I've ever had. It's freaking massive, and it's just so soft and warm and the ""painting icing"" was really fun. Sadly the frosting colors don't mix to make more colors but oh well lol.  
3. Sous Vide Poulet Rouge Chicken Roulade - good god this was great. The chicken was fantastic and the dish itself was astonishingly pretty. For a little plate they sure plated it up like a restaurant. Great quality and great flavor, would 100% get again.  
4. Callebaut Belgian Sipping Chocolate Flight (Non-alcoholic) at The Artist's Table - okay good god you better ***LOVE*** chocolate or you're gonna suffer. I consider myself a chocoholic, and I felt like absolute death after drinking maybe one. The more people that'll drink the better, because at least to my gf and I, the dark and white chocolate became practically painful, but that was also after drinking all of the delectable milk chocolate. Gotta say, pre-pain, white and dark chocolate were delicious, but became way too much after a couple sips. Extremely attentive teeth-brushing is practically required after this too lol.  
5. Wild Mushroom Risotto and Triple Chocolate Mousse at The Masterpiece Kitchen - I think this was possibly our favorite dishes we got. I got the chocolate, gf got the risotto, and she LOVES risotto. She was honestly shocked by how good it was. She immediately wanted another plate of it after she destroyed the first plate lol. I can still feel and taste the chocolate mousse. Absolutely delicious and a beauty to look at.

"e1qaeg8","I hate working out. Not because I don't want to be active, I actually enjoy being active. I like taking walks, I used to do dance and pilates, etc. Whenever I work out now I feel like shit afterwards. I'm exhausted. My joints will hurt for days after light activities. Sometimes I get so nauseous afterwards I feel like I'm gonna puke. Keep in mind, this is after a LIGHT workout. 

Speaking of nausea, counting calories. I love veggies. I don't really eat much red meat. I don't drink soda. Potato chips hurt my stomach. And yet, whenever I count calories, I feel hungry all the time. And when I feel hungry, I get nauseous. Like, REALLY nauseous, not just uncomfortable. Dizzy, hard to concentrate, feel like I'm gonna puke nausea.

Why do I have these problems? A few medical issues, I don't have time to go into all of them. I don't even know why my joints always hurt, that's the latest thing I'm trying to figure out. I have a stomach problem that has no cure, only one shitty medicine that hardly ever works and has a bunch of really awful side effects. It makes digesting shit really hard, so you know what feels good on my stomach? Carbs. Lots of carbs. And yogurt. Guess what's really high in calories? Carbs. And yogurt. I eat too much, I feel sick. I eat too little, I feel sick. So I'm not just sitting around gorging on unhealthy food, I cook and bring my own lunches to work, etc. But I can't snack on carrots and almonds because my body can't digest them well.

So yeah. I know you had surgery, and that's awful. I don't think I have it worse than burn victims.

"e1ej6wa","I‚Äôm not sure why the image quality is so crap, but I bought some actual apricot brandy and it was delicious but expensive and hard to find. 

In true nerd fashion I did a bunch of research on apricot brandy and discovered that 99% of the stuff sold in American markets as apricot brandy is not a true brandy but instead an apricot flavored liqueur. So if you buy brandy and it‚Äôs sweet, it‚Äôs a liqueur, intended to be used as a cocktail mixer. Real brandies are clear and not sweet, they are colorless fruit alcohol distillates. Some have color added back in from being aged in different materials, but they start off clear. There are of course different levels of fruit brandies, for example this bottle of pear brandy I bought for $15 or so in Prague tastes pretty noticeably different compared to the Capovilla: https://imgur.com/QfjZwma 

I was determined to have the most authentic Sandsedge-type brandy experience possible and I think I succeeded. The Capovilla fruit brandy is double distilled in small batches using apricots from mount Vesuvius using the time consuming bain marie process versus industrial stills, etc. And it tastes really fucking good. 

Does anyone else get really into researching little details from books like this?

"e0svqut","  A few days had passed since I first noticed people gorging on their lawns, barely acknowledging my presence beyond making sure I wasn‚Äôt going to attack them. Friends and family all afflicted, for all I knew, I was the last sane human on Earth. So I gathered some food and began to round up people into a large pack, hopefully to care for and protect as many as possible should they ever return to normal. Soon those hopes went out the window as I began to notice physical changes in the people around me. They began losing their hair, their skin became more coarse and thick, and birth marks began to morph into large spots. After a month of these disturbing transformations, I was now herding cattle around, leading them to new grass and going from town to town hoping to find another human. 

Then one night as I was getting ready to fall asleep in my car, a bright light shone done from the sky over the herd. I raced out to investigate, slowly the source descended and the herd, uncharacteristically, orderly made a large circle, continuing to stare at the light. I followed suit, standing just outside the circle. Eventually a large circular ship landed, and a ramp slowly extended out to the ground. Three hulking figures, neither human nor beast walked down and began making some cow-like guttural noises to each other and out towards all the cows. As they did, the cows began, walking single-file into the ship. 

I stood froze in terror as one of them approached me, making some of the same noises as it was making to the others. When it got to me, it bent down, razor sharp teeth and gaping maw directly in my face. A single sharp talon jabbed into my temple, and for a moment the world went blurry, and everything went silent. Slowly I regained focus, the grass looking more and more delicious, but what tore me away from the grass was the once unintelligible noises of the creatures suddenly made sense as a second one joined the first. ‚ÄúTechnically we‚Äôre not supposed to eat the non-transformed, but I‚Äôll make an exception this time since we didn‚Äôt stop for dinner.‚Äù",1529203453,"slowly i regained focus, the grass looking more and more delicious, but what tore me away from the grass was the once unintelligible noises of the creatures suddenly made sense as a second one joined the first.","delicious, but what","delicious","but",TRUE,"more and more delicious","more","more",NA,0

"dyok7mw","I don't speak for JITB, but if I play my cards right here they better hire me.

Honestly I don't think a vegan revolution is ""impending.""Numerous countries around the world have vegan cuisine, and have so for eons. The reason many European, and by extension American, cuisines include more meat, is because they lived on land where oftentimes, the only thing you could grow is grass. And that meant that you would grow grass for livestock to eat, and from there you would eat the livestock. And as the West spiked in population, so did the demand for meat, in particular burgers, as they became popular in the United States.

In some areas of the West, more and more people are choosing vegan lifestyles, and that's respectable. In addition, meat substitutes are getting more and more delicious, but at the same time I've been to countless vegan restaurants \(I have a lot of vegan friends\) where I'll get nickled and dimed for every little thing, the wait staff is rude, snooty, and acts in ways that would've gotten me fired from restaurants I've worked at, and don't actually seem to listen to the customers. For example, when a waiter and a customer cross paths, the waiter should always let the customer go first: they're paying to be there, while the waiter is paid to be there. Unless they have a heavy item, then there are some excuses. 

So, honestly, I'm 100&amp;#37; for the idea of getting vegan fast food, which would be cheaper, and way more convenient than not being able to get to my table for 4 minutes because the server cut me off. Or having someone act as though I'm inconveniencing their time dedicated to looking cool at their job by asking them to scoop me up some overpriced vegan ice cream. This isn't just me being treated this way, but my vegan friends as well.

But the big issue right now is the cost: a beef patty is usually much cheaper than a vegan patty, especially the better brands like the Impossible Burger. In addition, it'll take a little while for 3d printed meat to get to the point that it's cheap enough, and fast enough, for fast food, or to get to the point that a large quantity can be made for a large, working class, as well as rural, demographic, who won't pay 2 dollars extra for fast food in plenty of cases. So until ""The Future"" is able to account for the simple fact that people from rural areas don't like being treated as dumb for eating meat and won't spend much extra money on trying something that somebody who treats them as an idiot says they need to buy, as well as for the fact that switching over to 3d printed meat simply won't be viable for a fast food company for another few years, we'll just have to live with the here and now.

I'd honestly say give it 3\-5 years before a chain rolls out some form of vegan menu.",1525839173,"in addition, meat substitutes are getting more and more delicious, but at the same time i've been to countless vegan restaurants \(i have a lot of vegan friends\) where i'll get nickled and dimed for every little thing, the wait staff is rude, snooty, and acts in ways that would've gotten me fired from restaurants i've worked at, and don't actually seem to listen to the customers.","delicious, but at","delicious","but",TRUE,"more and more delicious","more","more",NA,0

"dtdw1yx","I was there in April 2015 and seriously almost didn't come home.  Everyone will tell you to do the helicopter tour, and they're right.  My other favorites on the island were the following:

ATV tour:  Totally different views of the island than you can get any other way, and a cool historical perspective on the island.  Also, lots of mud.  They loan you clothes to wear, but the socks I wore are still stained red from the mud 3 years later.  Totally worth it. https://www.kauaiatv.com/

Sailboat tour:  The Napali coast is pretty inaccessible,  and a helicopter is one of the best ways to see it.  A sailboat is nearly as good, but you get to see it at a much more relaxed pace.  One of the highlights of my entire life was laying on the netting at the front of the catamaran while dolphins played in the wake of the boat a few feet below me. https://www.napali.com/star/dinner/

The best expensive food I had on the island was at Bar Acuda in Hanelai.  Every single thing we had was delicious, but the highlight for me was locally raised Kauai buffalo, which was the special that night.  The local honeycomb with Humboldt Fog and Fuji Apple was amazing too.  http://www.restaurantbaracuda.com/

For cheap food, the best was Hulu Huli Chicken off of the Kuhio Highway in Anahola.  It was about $12 for the best chicken I've ever tasted in my life, a salad made from fresh greens from their garden, rice, and a banana grown in their yard.  It was easily enough food for two.  https://www.yelp.com/biz/huli-chicken-anahola

Another cheap favorite was the Waipouli Deli &amp; Restaurant in Kapaa.  This was the place locals all told us to go.  The kalua pork omelet was huge and delicious and maybe $8 or so?  Highly recommended.  We went back for round 2 and it was just as good. 
https://www.yelp.com/biz/waipouli-deli-and-restaurant-kapaa

If you like rum, check out the Koloa Rum Company.  They do free tastings, and while I'm not a big rum drinker, I did end up bringing back 2 bottles.  https://koloarum.com/

Waimea canyon was beautiful, spouting horn was really cool, and we spent a lot of time at Poipu beach.  It was really rainy on the north side of the island the week I was there, so I didn't get to see as much, but Haena Beach was pretty amazing.  The waves were way too big for me to go in, but there was one guy in the water on a boogie board putting on an amazing show.

For less specific advice, just plan on being flexible.  When we were there, it rained every day on the island, but it never rained everywhere on the island.

"dt43v0x","I took a lot of classes and attended conferences for organic farmers while contemplating a career change a few years ago. 

A fellow who used his fallow lawn (~6 acres; this was outside Atlanta) to launch a successful farming operation, told the story of these gorgeous and delicious, but extremely fragile tomatoes he grew. They would burst in transit. But they had variegated rinds and tremendous flavor. 

At his local farmers market, he managed to get a tiny quantity there intact, slicing up the remnants of the burst ones as free samples. Because he had so few of those to sell (like &lt;5 lbs.) he put a ridiculous price of IIRC $19/lb. The very first customer to taste them wrote him a check for his entire stash and took the burst ones as well. He thought he'd been exorbitant but was left wishing he'd asked for more. 

He cautioned that $100 for a basket of tomatoes wasn't common, but he wanted us to know it was possible, lol.

"dsuh0l3","I started Keto 7/1/17, and found it pretty easy. I realized that most of my cravings weren't for the carbs, but for whatever foods the carbs were acting as a vehicle for - pasta sauces, butter, tacos, etc. Easily changed into sauces over broccoli or cauliflower, butter on pretty much everything, and originally taco salads, though the discovery that Mission's low carb tortillas are actually delicious has eased things. I make a lot of mock-paninis or oven pizzas with those low-carb tortillas - they've become a staple for me, esp helpful in the fiber category.  Most of my dinners are delicious but simple - meat + veg. Pork chop + roasted brussels sprouts. Chicken breast + broccoli in garlic butter sauce. Steak + roasted cauliflower. That sort of thing.

I don't adjust my calorie count as I lose (though I absolutely track calories and macros in MFP - I'm Starbuck2011 if anyone wants to friend me, though I'm not terribly active there except to track). I figured up the TDEE for my goal weight (~1550 calories) and give myself a 200 calorie window around that depending on how I feel. That way my weight loss may slow a bit as I get nearer my goal, but maintenance SHOULD be a snap, since I'm already accustomed to that amount of food.

"dp5qb1k","Re: the cheesecake bars made with cottage cheese and stevia--first...GROSS!!!! But mainly, this reminded me of a ""project"" my Nmom, That Bitch, has been working on recently. For a little background, the women in my family tend to seriously struggle with their weight. I mean seriously struggle. My grandmother was the only overweight woman on the cancer ward. My awesome aunt actually gained weight when her jaw was wired shut. That Bitch was morbidly obese until she underwent gastric bypass 15-20 years ago. Aside from crap genes in the family, there are also awesomely delicious but super carby family recipes that almost everyone loves. One of these is a chocolate cake recipe that goes back generations. Story goes that this cake is/was so awesome that the ranch hands back in the day rode to Mexico and stole a giant bag of sugar so my however many greats great grandma would have the ingredients to make this cake (during one of the major wars and rationing). There is absolutely nothing healthy about this cake. It calls for ""Oleo,"" sugar, flour, eggs, *coffee*, butter, powdered sugar, and more coffee. And nuts, but I leave those off because I don't like crunchy cake. This cake is awesome, and I've managed to get my friends at one of my daily stops so addicted to it, they beg me to make it for them every week.

Anyway, That Bitch's ""project"" is to make this cake recipe diabetic friendly and gluten free. Because she really can't have sugar anymore and is convinced that gluten is evil (spoiler: she does **not** have celiac disease). So she's subbing out the flour for some nut flour (yuck), the sugar for Stevia (double yuck--I personally cannot stand Stevia), the eggs for egg substitute, etc. I have not tasted this abomination, though I have a feeling if I allow her to come for Thanksgiving, she's going to bring it.

Anyway, my point of this is, she's the same as Wreckasauraus in that she can't grasp the idea that it's all about personal responsibility and choice. I mean...I miss The Cake, especially when I'm making it every week for my friends, but even *I* understand that I can't really have it and be healthy too.

If you are sedentary, your TDEE is approx 2200 calories. Maybe raise your calorie intake to 2000 and add some light exercise? It will take you longer to take off the pounds, but you may need the extra energy.

Carolina Reapers were developed by a guy named Smokin Ed Currie, and it's a cross between a ghost pepper and a red habanero! They clock in at over 2,000,000 scoville units, about twice as hot as police grade pepper spray! Contrary to popular belief, they are VERY flavorful and delicious, but holy titties pal, will they make you want to rip your mouth off of your own face if you go at them like a rookie. ALWAYS wear gloves when handling/cutting any super hot peppers, and do not for any reason touch your face or your cock/vag. You will regret it. 

Growing them is simple as buying seeds or a plant and treating them like normal peppers.  Good sunlight, lots of water, etc. Harvest time is early fall, I should be harvesting mine in the north east in about 3 weeks time. Mine got off to a bit of a late start due to vacations, and being in a shitty location with limited sun, but they're doing better now that I've moved. 

The advantages of cooking with super hots is a little goes a long way, and you can develop lots of different flavors in a dish along with a searing, deep burn that chili heads love without overpowering it with vinegar, salt or other common hot sauce ingredients. 

Here's a rub recipe I've been working on. This can be used on any BBQ, but I'd alter it a little heavier on the spices/salt, and lighter on the sugar for brisket or heartier meats.

1 cup brown sugar
1tbsp coarse pink sea salt
1 tbsp paprika
1 tbsp cumin
2 tbsp coriander
A few shakes of crushed red pepper
Cracked black pepper until you feel slightly uncomfortable with that amount of pepper
Half tea spoon of dried Carolina reaper (sub habanero and double the quantity if you're a wussyboi)

Try it before you rub it. If you immediately have a panic attack due to heat, you did it right. But if you're a wussyboiii, add more of the non spicy ingredients, especially the sugar, and you'll cool it down a bit. Remember, a lot of the capsaicin will cook off over the smoke and mellow down, especially with the sugar, so you want to panic a little when you try it dry.

Also PRO TIP! If you've bitten off more than you can chew spice wise, milk works, but pure sugar works better. Sugar bonds with capsaicin, and will cool the burn. Take a spoon full of sugar and let it dissolve in your saliva and swish it around.

This concludes today's spicy facts! Hope you enjoyed!

Some things that I learned over the many years before I figured it all out:

1.  Steamed or cooked veggies are 1000000000000 times easier to digest than raw.  Salads are delicious, but like you, I'd see everything a few hours later.   Undigested vitamins and nutrients don't do much for your body.  But, a quick steam or stir fry and I can eat them without (as many) troubles.  Also the cruciferous veggies are much harder to digest (broccoli, brussels, onions, garlic, cauliflower, etc.) so stick to things like cucumbers, bell peppers, eggplant, tomatoes (even diced canned tomatoes) .  Frozen veggies are easy to nuke and cover in sauce and toss with some pasta.

2.  Protein shakes.   Seriously easy and DELICIOUS. Get some high quality whey protein and blend with spinach (for those vitamins!) banana and peanut butter and it's like a dessert.  These are great to bring to work too, as they aren't hard on the digestion and it's easy to make yourself drink even if you aren't hungry.

3. Chicken and eggs have almost no fiber and are very high protein and filling.  Boil eggs for snacking.  Slow cook a bunch of chicken breasts with a jar of salsa, shred and make tacos/burritos.  

4.  Soup!  Throw some of that shredded chicked, a couple bags of frozen veggies and maybe some beans (if you can tolerate them) with some chicken broth, and eat over pasta, with rice or with a side of toasted bread.

All of these options are really easy to customize flavors using any of the spice mixes at the grocery (mrs. dash makes some really good ones) and are CHEAP.  

Lastly, rice cakes with peanut butter/banana (both rice cakes and banana are easy on digestion) or avocado or fried eggs make great snacks.

**Aveeno Ultra-Calming Makeup Removing Wipes** - I bought these on a whim because Cassie (YT ThriftThick) loves them, but nooooo I did not like them. They were very heavily fragranced, and I noticed my face would be red and angry after I used them. Not calming in the least. WNRP

**Beauty 360 Premium Facial Cleansing Pads** x2 - These are good and fine, I get them at CVS. I bought the Shiseido facial cottons during the recent sale so WNRP.

**Batiste Dry Shampoo, original scent** - Love this stuff, RP.

**Soap and Glory Peaches and Clean Deep Cleansing Milk, DS** - Okay, this stuff. I got this as an Ulta sample, and was excited to try it because I've been in the market for an emulsifying oil cleanser, and a main ingredient in here is jojoba oil. The fragrance is pretty intense, but I rather enjoy it. What really kills me about this is that there's something minty in here. Like, minty and tingly. When it's just on your face everything is cool. I used it once to remove my base makeup, it worked fine, whatever. When I used it again, I tried to remove my eyeshadow with it, and NOOOOO. Imagine applying Dr. Bronner's Peppermint soap directly to the eyeballs. No bueno. My eyes and the whole area around them was a red, tingly inferno for ten minutes. *Granted*, it literally says on the package not to get this near your eyes. However, I don't see the point of an oil cleanser that you can't use for your entire face, personally. Between the scent and the tinglies, WNP.

**EvanHealy Lavender Facial Tonic HydroSoul** - I never hear anyone talk about this brand, presumably because it's expensive and sold in Whole Foods, but I really enjoyed this stuff. I sprayed it on my face after cleansing and before moisturizing in the morning. It's got a beautiful lavender scent and it's extremely gentle and soothing. WMRP

"dgzfkvu","This is a good recap. I would add that in addition to getting in at the right time with the tumblr it crowd, her fashion point of view was largely vintage, thrifting and sewing. Her Halloween costumes were one of her most popular features, although they declined considerably in recent years. She is fairly skilled at sewing, but almost never features tutorials, which is part of her Queen Bee mentality-- she doesn't want to actually teach or share experiences with people, she wants their envy. She has to be the ""best"" (...nothing she has ever created is all that special to begin with but regardless), and if she shared a recipe or sewing pattern, someone might make it better than her and she can't have that. 

She also once said (on one of her old blogs lovepuppy or midwestjess) that she wanted to be ""internet famous"" and mused rather mechanically on blogging, ""give it a human touch, people like that."" She rarely talks about IRL friends, doesn't seem to have any really, other than that fashion professor/fangirl/former book club host who is only in town part-time these days (she moved but still teaches at IU). The local intel has been that she is a snot, socially awkward, and demands to be the center of attention, which is why people try and avoid her, or are polite so as to not make waves. 

Before she got pregnant with FAQ, she did whole 30 for the first time. She also went to the gym regularly and had a personal trainer. This was her #getfit #paleo phase, and she definitely peacocked around flaunting her new look. It was probably the best she looked in Bloomington. She crowed about it being a total lifestyle change for her. Since then, she claims to eat ""80/20"" although it is clear that is not the case (she eats croissants and donuts on a near daily basis, which is fine and delicious, but not whole30 or paleo).

"dfjxwae","I just wrote an essay on the free market pretty much agreeing with just that. It is often argued that if consumers want ""liqour over bibles"" then it is not the producers job to curtail their moral decisions.
I wonder though, taken to the extreme this practice becomes less and less moral. If I sell rotting food to a blind man, but the blind man thinks the food is safe and delicious - and then afterwards the man is violently ill - does that transaction not count as immoral?
And on a larger scale, if I sold a whole community food that they thought was delicious but was bad for their health - and eventually led to increased heart failure in some - is this action not immoral also?

It is argued that the consumer has the choice in the free market. So it would be on the community to select food that will not kill them. Many argue that it would be morally wrong and a violation of rights to meddle in their choice in a libertarian state. But I wonder, (and propose myself, as my own opinion) if selling products that harm individuals is immoral regardless of the consumers choice. I think that the producer should face up to their immoral actions and accept that what they sell is morally questionable instead of dismissing morality with the rationale of 'free' market choice. I think it is an important distinction to make.

"ddo5dbz","Well, my SIL went all out and made and bottled her own wine for the wedding and had it available in bottle and on tap from nice dispensers.  They also filled a few canoes with ice and beer.  It was awesome and delicious but she is possibly the most industrious bride I've ever met!  This is the extreme route.

A close friend of mine went the easier route.  She limited the types of drinks that were available to whiskey and vodka (I think) with mixers.  She also had a basic selection of wine and beer.  A friend of the groom poured the drinks (the groom was a bartender himself, so he knew who to trust).  The drinks were free but the bartender was paid and received boucous tips.  If I remember correctly the alcohol lasted most of the night, even though our group tends to be pretty heavy drinkers, as well.  I think she just took the number of people and allotted a certain number of drinks for each, depending on know own drinking habits.  Older family members were expected to drink wine and less of it, while drinking buddies were expected to take a larger percentage of the liquor.  Seemed to work out well for her.  

I guess you do have to know someone you trust to run the bar, though, and also be willing to go for a lower end thing.  You're guests aren't going to be able to order mojitos or fancy martinis unless you hire someone specifically with that knowledge and the tools.  I imagine it's very possible to hire someone from a local bar and supply the alcohol yourself, though I haven't seen it done in practice.",1486949963,"it was awesome and delicious but she is possibly the most industrious bride i've ever met!","awesome and delicious","delicious",NA,FALSE,"awesome and delicious","awesome",NA,NA,0

I just can't have sweets in my life, or I will eat all of them. If j give myself an inch, I will take a mile. So, when I am at home or doing my own thing, I eat Keto. 

However, I think it is a challenging way of eating when you think of the social impact of your decisions. Yes, family and friends can be supportive, but it can also be burdensome to people if they don't understand what they can make for you. In my case, both of my brothers have food allergies. One follows a low fodmap and gluten free diet due to hypothyroidism, and the other has a severe nut/legume allergy. So for Thanksgiving, I have decided not to eat Keto because I think it would just be too much for my mom to accommodate. 

More than anything for me, Keto has helped me develop self discipline so that when I am in those situations where delicious, but non Keto food is available, I can rein myself in and have a bit but not binge. That said, I still struggle with this; I love to eat and eat and eat. Even last night at a party where literally the only Keto friendly food was celery and broccoli, I caved and ate tons of non Keto food. Today, I woke up feeling like I had an actual hangover. And I didn't even have a single drink! As frustrated as I am with my own lack of self discipline, I just have to move forward and work toward having more self discipline in the future.

Wild Hybrid's 'Blue Men of Minch' is also my current fave, especially since the very reason why I started buying indies was because I love the smell of the ocean--and I never really got to find a true ocean scent among mainstream brands (they're either too soapy, too powdery, too floral, or like men's deodorant)--but BMoM has that sparkly, truly salty seawater note that reminds me so much of the real deal. It's fresher and colder than Sixteen92's The Awakening (which also has a great and almost realistic ocean smell, but it's darker, stormier, and with a 'fishier' note and a delicious taffy smell), and it also has blue cotton candy too!

"d6uw0zf","&gt; Abovementioned ""law"" is imposed on us by statist oppressors

That's the part where I disagree. There can be non-monopolistic justice systems that are voluntary and not force based. A corporation could function fully under such a system. No use of force is thus required.

&gt;That's why I erred on a more liberal definition of corporation, ""an organization of individuals formed to foster a shared goal, e.g. financial gain.""

That's a really bad definition of the word, since you are basically describing an organization, not a corporation. But leftists never attack organizations, they always go against corporations specifically.

&gt;Please offer an alternative definition we could both agree on, one which doesn't involve the state sticking its dumb fingers into other people's pies.

I'm happy with the definition you provided: ""a company or group of people authorized to act as a single entity (legally a person) and recognized as such in law.""

Like I said, that definition does not include a state, since there can be law without a state.

&gt;That's not because curare is safe and delicious, but because it's much less prevalent. The whole world is a statist shithole, though it's, arguably, not a drug cartel.

State is the only reason why drug cartels are violent in the first place. Since the government has made them outlaws by banning drugs, they cannot solve their disputes in a court of law. If there was no war against drugs, the drug cartels would function like any other business: on a voluntary basis. And they would be very careful about their reputations in the eyes of their customers, like all businesses have to be.

I am just waking up to how fat the people in my life are getting, seemingly at the same rate that I am losing weight. And it's not just that they're gaining weight, it's that they treat weight gain as normal and inevitable. 

There's no sense of, Gee, I've gained weight, better reign this baby in! The habits continue.

**Activities**

* You'll be just south of Sunrise. There's actually a great piece of Fort Lauderdale history right behind where you'll be called The Bonnet House. See if it's open. They do a tour of the house and then a golf cart tour of the grounds and all the native flora and fauna (they have monkeys and some of the most beautiful orchids I've ever seen).  Go in the morning; it gets hot.
* Birch State Park, also on Sunrise, has Segway tours of the beach, I assume it's just segways along the beach lol. They also have kayaks for rent if you want to paddle around. They have a hiking trail and picnic tables along the water where you can sometimes see manatees. 
* Sunrise and a1a has a pretty poppin' night life. 
* Las Olas (take an uber, trust me) is great for just walking along. Sometimes the weekends hold art fairs in the street. Tons of restaurants. 
* Museum of Art has some traveling exhibits and some permanent. They're always good, and the permanent one is great so even if the traveling one sucks you've got that. 
* Himmershee is basically west Las Olas, but has more clubs and bars where LO has more people watching and cocktails.  Tarpon Bend and Fat Cats are Himmershee.

***

**Food**

* Fort Lauderdale has a massive amount of restaurants. I mean, it's obscene. 
* Mason Jar on Oakland is great food (get the chicken pot pie, short ribs, or ravioli -pasta made fresh in house)
* 15th Street Fisheries (just off 17th Street causeway). 2 menus for bottom and top floor. The top is reservation only and has magnificent seafood. Bottom floor the food isn't as expensive, still really damn good, but more casual. And make sure you ask your waiter to show you where to buy frozen shrimp to feed the tarpon! There's a floating dock out back. *Very* cool. Try the conch chowder and ask for the shot of brandy.
* Las Olas west of a1a. Mangos is a FtL staple, but most of the places will be great. *Do NOT go to the Floridian*. It is terrible. It used to be *the* place to go but it is now the place we know *not* to go. Kilwins has great fudge and ice cream (there's also one on Commercial- north). *On* a1a you've got the Elbo Room, pretty great spot. Friday nights there's a festival of sorts.  Taco Craft is better than Rocco's Tacos, do not go to Pizza Craft.
* If you like hoagies/subs/whatever, Laspadas is the place for you. There's one on east Commercial (north) and another on 17th St (south)
* Commercial (take uber, stay on a1a, go north past sunrise and oakland) has a lot of great eats. Ocean 101 has bottomless mimosas on the weekend and incredible food. We went for dinner recently - outstanding. Arubas is right on the sand, live music, not stingy with the shrimp and scallops. Keeses is a tiny Caribbean joint, good food, definitely a dive. Jan's Chocolates. She's a super nice lady who makes chocolate right in the back and not only is it delicious but it's like eating tiny, creamy works of art.
* There is a series of restaurants owned by the same 3 men but are all very different cuisines. Coconuts, the best of them, right there on a1a, has fabulous seafood, salads, drinks. I like the crabcakes. Uber there, valet only. 
* SHUCK'N'DIVE!!! Can't believe it took me this long to remember shuck. Wednesday dollar oyster night! Sat/sun chicken and waffles! Local beers. Seriously one of the best restaurants in south Florida. 
* New York Grilled Cheese in Wilton Manors. Just a heads up, if you're homophobic don't go. If you're cool with gays Wilton Manors is the shit. Amazing food and drinks, happy hours, shows, walking. Wilton Creamery is an ice cream place with interesting flavors like corn and blueberry etc. Really great area!!
* Chill'N is a local chain from Miami that makes nitrogen ice cream right in front of you. Cheap and delicious, on US1.
* 2 bbq choices, both on US1: Tom Jenkins is south of you, Blue Willies is north of you. TJ gets so busy they actually run out of ribs, BW doesn't have a sign. Or parking. But they're both some of the best bbq you'll have. 
* Croissant Time, on US1 and 13th. Traditional French pastries, great light breakfast (best croissant) closed on Mondays. 
* The Nook is quite far from where you'll be but if you want German for whatever reason that place is ridiculously good and reasonably priced. And they have a happy hour ending at 6:30.

* Funky Buddha, local sofla brewery. Take a tour, eat a burger, get a growler.  (Dixie and almost oakland)
* LaserWolf, craft bar with a great courtyard out back. Chill atmosphere, hard to find. Our favorite bar in town.
* Parrot, walking distance to you. Kind of a sports bar with a Philly theme. During season they do green jello shots when the Eagles score.
* Another Castle, right across from Funky, very small bar, if you like video games they have ***all*** the old games on screens every 2 seats. The controllers are only a little sticky ;)
* Riverside Cafe is in a neighborhood called Sailboat Bend. Wall of bottled craft beer and outstanding food. Can get expensive if you're not careful.  And the Cartel, same owners, right across the street, no food, more beer and beer things.
* I hate to say this about a local place but Lauderale Brewery isn't great. Their absolute best beer is only mediocre and their worst beer will give you nightmares for months. Plus it's crazy hard to find. It's a neat place and I heard they're getting help from Funky but we went 4/5 times and it was never good.
* Fat Cats has live music and a ton of great beer.

***

**Shopping**

* Galleria. I mean, it's a mall. Shrug
* Broward Design Center is expensive and it's things are probably to large to caret home with you but they feature a lot of local artists and they're stuff is just really cool to look at even if you can't have any of it.
* Aventura and Palm Beach have the fancy shopping if you're into that. Fendi and Tiffany, etc.

"d4tb2fm","My argument is in favor of waffles. 

My main argument about the benefit of waffles over pancakes comes from the versatility of the waffle. 

1) Waffles are storage friendly. I can freeze a waffle and leave it there for an extended period of time before reheating it and enjoying. The waffle is a food for a survivor. 

2) Waffles are a food which can be enjoyed cold or hot. A frozen waffle can be eaten by itself or even used as additions to food (Frozen waffle ice cream sandwich anyone?)

3) Waffles can not just be flavored with things but stuffed with amazing things. The Belgian people perfected a type of waffle which not only is flakey and delicious but is filled with a glorious mixture of sweetened creams and fruity concoctions. You have opened the world up to a level of food experimentation which cannot be calculated successfully. 

4) With regards to the engineering of the waffle, it is more efficient with regards to syrup use. 

The waffle has indent marks in the surface. These marks are from the waffle iron but they serve a secondary purpose beyond just making sure the waffle is correctly cooked. They act as tiny bowls to collect all manner of flavor you pour on top of your waffle. 

That is a level of intelligent design which would make an atheist believe in G-d.",1467244258,"the belgian people perfected a type of waffle which not only is flakey and delicious but is filled with a glorious mixture of sweetened creams and fruity concoctions.","flakey and delicious","delicious",NA,FALSE,"flakey and delicious","flakey",NA,NA,0

3. You don't want to use the oil you fried your damn meatballs in as a base for your sauce, that shit is for frying, not for sauce. Instead, take a couple raw meat balls, drop them in some decent olive oil and break them apart and brown them through. Then add the onion and the tomato and spices.

"d30j34y","First thing, if you need more energy you need more carbs not protein. Protein is there to rebuild your muscles and if digested our body makes urea as a byproduct which is bad for your liver. I don't know how big those effects are but just don't overdo your protein and you'll definitely be fine.

Second I'd suggest to just eat more. I assume you do not eat total garbage so just eating more will be fine. However, if you feel like you need more insight on what to eat and are not sure if you are actually eating enough here is what I recommend but keep in mind that I am just a college student who spent some time researching this stuff (in high school and a litte bit as a hobby and I don't study any health/nutrient related) so I am not the most reliable source I guess...

Fat obviously has the most calories but you shouldn't eat too fatty. But adding some avocados here will not only be delicious but also healthy, also if you like nuts, start snacking them but not the roasted salted ones (eventhough roasted and salted cashews are heaven) as you get really hungry by eating those and just eat an entire can/package.

For carbs I'd recommend eating more potatoes. The healthiest way to eat them is to boil them I guess (as a whole, skin on, just wash it) and pour some sauce over them or just put a little butter/margerine and peas on top but cutting them in slices and frying them with some onions is really delicious and satisfying, also eat pickles together with it for maximum deliciousnes. Rice is great too and noodles anyway but noodles have gluten (wheat protein) and I have no idea if that actually matters but if you care about that you will already know how to deal with that or have to research that on your own. If you can afford to buy a sweet potatoe every here and there than do that, they are really great and you can use them like you use normal potatoes. I personally think potatoes are the best thing on this list (especially sweet potatoes) because they have really good physiology (is that the right term? I mean they have good stuff in them, fiber, carbs and I guess vitamins? somewhat like that).

Now for protein, there are many obtions and in short you want to eat more peas, beans, lentils and green veggies. Green veggies don't have that high protein content but they have more protein than most veggies. Peas, lentils and beans on the other hand have a lot of protein. If you think you really need lots and lots of protein eat soy beans they have the most protein of all the beans but I've heard they are not the healthiest thing to eat and I don't know why people said that. If you are interested you need to research that yourself, however eating any kind of beans will suffice your protein needs.

If I remember correctly our goal should be 55%carbs, 15% protein and 30% fats (which means 55% of your energy intake should come from carbs and so on). I might have confused the number of fat and protein but it isn't that important anyway. It basically means eat lots and lots of carb foods like what I mentioned and less high protein or fatty foods. Because 1g fat has like 34kCal and 1g carb/protein have like 18kCal or so. The numbers might not be accurate but the important thing is that carbs and protein have about half as much energy as fat which is why eating a lot of fat makes us fat. I think if people want/need to bulk up eating protein might be a good choice but I am not sure of that and overdoing it is definitely unhealthy. 60g of protein is about what you need.

You can also use this [calculator](http://www.healthycalculators.com/calories-intake-requirement.php) website to see how much you actually need to eat. It also shows you have much to eath if you want to loose or gain weight but I'd rather focus on the first one which shows if you actually eat enough. 

If you really care a lot you can write down how much you actually eat every day for a week or so (don't cheat, just live like you do now and write it down) and see if it's close. It takes some effort and of course meeting the exact numbers is not important at all but it's just there to give you an idea. But tbh. I wouldn't do that myself as I am too lazy and don't have a scale.

Btw there might still be erroes because I rewrote this thing twice and already spent too much time writing this. If you read anything confusing just ask, I probably just wandered off in my mind and lost track of what I actaully wanted to write.

*EDIT* OH I forgot about drinking. 2 liters a day + 1L for every hour of sport. Seriously, that is how much we need (or at least that is what I was taught in school). If you cannot do it, don't feel bad most people don't and it's okay but just drink a lot. Keep in mind that our bodies cannot utilize an unlimited amount of water in a given time. Like 0.2 liters per hour(or so?) so just keep drinking throughout your whole day and don't just chug 5 liters in the morning and then loose all the while going to the toilet. However we need more water during exercise because oif the sweat so drinking a lot then should be okay I guess. Again, I am not a big fan of numbers in this health thing. Just remember to drink loads and loads of water.

"d27w3x4","As someone already mentioned, Phuket sucks ass, spend as little time there as you can. Your best bet is to take a bus to the port and get your butt to Koh Phi Phi ASAP. I would give anything to be back on that beautiful island. Get a cheap bungalow that's right by the beach and go snorkeling, hike to the top of the mountain and overlook the entire island and out into the beautiful ocean. Go party on the beach too, and when the tide recedes at night, walk out hundreds of yards onto the wet sand and marvel at the beauty. 

Seriously, stay out of Phuket! Next, IMO you don't need that much time in Bangkok. You'll have had a taste of Thailand already, now just throw a major metropolis on top of that and that is Bangkok. There are some must-sees like the Reclining Buddha at Wat Pho, the floating market and having dinner on the Chao Phraya River (I'm pretty sure that's it I don't remember). If you wanna see the entire city at night, go to the Sky Bar lounge, I think it's like 75 stories high? Crazy, and scary, but an amazing view.

Spend time getting to know Chiang Mai. It's a beautiful city and it was my gateway to Thailand. The people are kind, the food is amazing (You MUST eat Khao Soi for me, it's so delicious, and it's their regional dish). Go to the Tiger Kingdom, yeah they're in cages and probably slightly doped (although they claim they're not) but it's an incredible feeling. Ride the elephants at a sanctuary. Do your research and find a good one. Elephants typically need to be broken to let someone ride them but I've heard some of the really good sanctuaries avoid this so read around.

If you have the opportunity to somehow get to Koh Pha Ngan - do it. My buddies and I lived almost literally on the beach. Our bungalow was 15 steps from the shore. We rented mopeds and cruised around the island every day: best experience ever. 

Lastly, eat out of the street stalls! The food is cheap and delicious but follow the locals and eat fresh. Also go to your PCP and get some anti-diarrheal medicine and maybe some antibiotics to take when you get travelers sickness - it's almost certainly inevitable if you're gonna be culinarily adventurous.

(Also, I wanted to second /u/anbeav's comment - finding naturally low-carb or carb-free foods and meals is the way to go.)

I see /u/shadedspaces already recommended keto to you, and I've tried doing strict keto in the past.  It was delicious but hard for my family, so we don't do keto anymore (we do eat gluten free and paleo/primal which is lower on grains).  BUT Keto recipes can still be a great resource - here's why -- I can use a Keto Meal Plan that only gets me 30 grams of carbs a day ... and then, I can have a snack or two that does have more carbs and still have a healthier, low carb day.  Just my two cents.

1) My new go-to: http://thenourishedcaveman.com/keto-resources/ -- her one-week meal plan is simple and delicious.  Have to go read her four-week meal plan now :).

EDIT: I received her one-week meal plan for free in a Paleo Bundle at some point - didn't realize you would have to pay for it.  Still, I really recommend her one-week meal plan (and may pay for the four-week plan later myself).

2) My favorites with caveats: I love these three lady keto bloggers (linked below), and the first two have awesome free meal plans on their websites.  That said, I don't follow their meal plans exactly or eat all of their recipes because they have a different style of cooking than I do.  They are fun to try, have tons of great keto information, and really delicious recipes, though!

Seriously, though, to you or any passers-by in the thread who might be more interested, falafel is delicious. I make a variation of [this recipe](http://www.sooogood.org/iraqi_food_recipes/falafel.html) with extra greens and about 1/2-3/4 tsp salt instead of a full teaspoon.

"d0v8oma","**Price:** around $60 in the LCBO, 750ml

**Served:** in a glencairn neat, by the garden on a cool summer evening  

**Appearance:** almost like a weak orange flavoured Kool-Aid, thick legs like old dribbly candles, tasty looking

**Nose:** peaches, pepper, a sharpness like an old cheese, sour cherry blaster candy, a musty sherry that relaxes after some air and turns to almost a butterscotch, strong ground apples after a week

**Taste:** melted honey, sharp oak, strong scotchy goodness, cookie dough, hazelnut finish after its had some air

**Finish:** wow honey oak and fruity sweetness the best part, the fruit is somewhere around cherries, apricots, grapes and tangerines... This is new to me. 

The finish stole the show on these drams.  So much so, that the whiskey didn't waste much time on my tongue before I rushed in back to enjoy the lingering fruit explosion.  The aftertaste was sweet and strong and delicious but the time between sips was time well spent. This was something new for me as it's my first sherried single malt.  I'm partial to blends on the regular and peaty Islay when I want to splurge on a pricey bottle.  Altogether, a very good whisky and really displays the diversity of flavour that can be found in scotch whiskey.

After a few evenings with this stuff I have got to question its alcohol content.  I drink three or four drams and don't get the same effects as usual.  I don't have a hydrometer so I can't do any science on it.

**Rating:** withheld as I did this review last summer and can't really justify scoring it now after all the roads I've been down.

Another new cooking tip: 

I habitually over-buy vegetables to make sure I eat them and have enough for specific recipes during the week (and I think that's a good way to go), but then I'm left with a couple unused odds and ends at the end of it.  What does someone do with half a broccoli head? 

For the longest time when I started cooking, I didn't know how to use them up, but there are a couple easy things you can do so they don't go to waste.    

Turn them into simple soups a bit like [this one](http://www.onehundreddollarsamonth.com/spinach-and-white-bean-soup/) or make steamed or [roasted vegetables](http://www.tablefortwoblog.com/roasted-vegetables/) and pair it with something like bread, rice, or pasta.  These things scale really well (if you have a lot or a little extra), and are very versatile (accept a lot of different kinds of ingredients you have left over).  

You can also do the reverse, these things (roasting, soup... ing) can be made in huge batches on purpose at the beginning of the week (if you want to cook once a week instead of every day).

"d03mn5g","Plantation Pineapple Daiquiri


Shook up a few of these last night using our new-ish bottle of Plantation Pineapple Rum.  Normally I'm not a fan of flavored spirits (aside from liqueurs) but this stuff is amazing.  The way its flavored using real pineapple rinds while aging I think makes the difference.  The end product tastes like grilled pineapple soaked in a delicious funky rum.


The beauty of this cocktail is its simplicity yet the depth of flavor leads one to believe there are far more than 3 ingredients.  It really tastes like some crazy complex Tiki drink made with 3 different rums, maybe some kind of liqueur, several different fruit juices and bitters.  However its just a simple daiquiri made with an amazing rum. 


The recipe:

2 oz Plantation Pineapple Rum

0.25  oz Simple Syrup (I used white sugar syrup but Turbinado would probably be better)

1 oz lime juice (I didn't measure the juice I used a half of a lime which I estimated was about 1 oz of juice)

Shake with ice and serve in a chilled glass without ice.

The first round I made I used 0.5 oz of simple but thought it a bit too sweet given how sweet the rum is so I cut it back to 0.25 oz and it was much better.  I'd say adjust for your taste, same with the lime juice.

I wanted to keep the other ingredients minimal to really keep the focus on the flavor of this rum.

"cxq9nd2","Had these sitting in my review book for a while and seeing a post about the upcoming Maker‚Äôs Mark offerings, this prompted me to post my #8, #9 &amp; #10 reviews. Maker‚Äôs Mark 90¬∞, Maker‚Äôs Mark 46 and Maker‚Äôs Mark Cask Strength.

#8 ‚Äì Maker‚Äôs Mark. 90¬∞
It‚Äôs widely talked about ‚Äúregular‚Äù Maker‚Äôs Mark is the ‚Äúgateway‚Äù bourbon. I don‚Äôt think that could be more true. Everybody usually starts with Maker‚Äôs Mark. It‚Äôs often because they see the iconic bottle and the famous red wax. Easy to drink and cheap to replace, how could you not like it. When I first became interested in bourbon, I bought a bottle and sipped it over so much ice; it would have sunk the Titanic. After going to Loretto, I was even more in awe of this fine bourbon so I began drinking it with 2 cubes, and then 1, until I could drink it straight. So when they were going to GASP, LOWER THE PROOF, I went out and bought a case of 1.75‚Äôs and a case of 750‚Äôs. What a dumbass. 

Color: Light copper. 

Nose: Sweet as sweet can be. Vanilla, brown sugar, toffee. You get slapped with some alcohol but, it quickly fades to the vanilla.

Taste: Smooooth. Am I drinking anything, but cinnamon, toffee, vanilla and oak? Too easy to drink, but also since it‚Äôs so easy, it makes it too easy to drink and not ‚Äúas fun.‚Äù

Finish: Short, but then medium. Medium. It seems to be very easy going and then if you sit there, it will come back with a nice sweet, leather oaky finish. It‚Äôs‚Ä¶..interesting and delicious. 

Overall: 83/100. But how can you not like it? It‚Äôs a classic. I don‚Äôt scoff if it‚Äôs offered to me and 9 times out of 10, bourbon drinkers usually have it on hand. Let that be the statement about Maker‚Äôs Mark. 

#9 ‚Äì Maker‚Äôs Mark 46
Maker‚Äôs Mark 90¬∞ has been around for half a century and B. Samuels Jr. is getting ready to retire. Well, the people want more DOGGONNIT!!! So what do the people in Loretto do? Take regular Maker‚Äôs Mark and throw it in a barrel with seasoned French Oak staves for a little longer, raise the proof 4, new bottle and BOOM‚Ä¶the world is now better because of Maker‚Äôs 46. Um no. 

Color: Amber. 

Nose: I do get the toasted oak, vanilla and corn. It IS different than 90¬∞

Taste: Again, the toasted oak. Vanilla, chocolate. Leather. 

Finish: Medium. Sweetness with some leather and oak thrown in.

Overall: 87/100. Do I think it‚Äôs better than regular MM? Sure. The added proof and maturation does help it, but I just really don‚Äôt go and reach for it. It‚Äôs always overlooked by me. 

#10 ‚Äì Maker‚Äôs Mark Cask Strength
So I told you how I was an asshat and bought 90¬∞ Maker‚Äôs for the entire county I lived in when MM decided to drop the proof? Well what does MM do, but come out with CASK STRENGTH FRIGGIN‚Äô MM. So not only do I have enough 90¬∞ for the central US, but now I have to go to Loretto to get the Cask Strength? SHEESH. 

Color: Maker‚Äôs 46 + a few. Dark amber.

Nose: Damn, ethanol. Slap to the face by ethanol. It doesn‚Äôt really fade too much either. Corn, vanilla, sweet brown sugar. 

Taste: Tastes green. Corn, but I do pick up the brown sugar and sweetness. Oh by the way, it burns on the palate too.

Finish: Cinnemon. Oak. Toasted barrel, honey. It is a long finish due to the acetone. 

Overall: 87/100. It‚Äôs a great expression for Maker‚Äôs Mark, but I would love to see this aged another few years to really see what this is like. Could you imagine a 9yr old Cask Strength Maker‚Äôs Mark? That would be delicious, but until that happens. This doesn‚Äôt do much for me due to the young age and ethanol. Could MM46 Cask Strength be the magic ticket? I don‚Äôt know, but I‚Äôm not rushing out to find any.

Epcot - If you're up for in-park, certain park restaurants can also do fireworks seatings (Spice Road Table, Rose &amp; Crown, Hacienda de San Angel, Monsieur Paul, Tokyo Dining)

Epcot Resort Area - Flying Fish is the best go-to in Epcot Resorts for special occasion dining.  We had our first wedding anniversary dinner there and it was fantastic.  I would skip Yachtsman (since I focus on experience &amp; it's underwhelming in that dept).

Hollywood Studios - don't overlook the Brown Derby for great dining options if you're okay doing in-park dining.

Animal Kingdom Lodge - all three restaurants are fantastic but with completely different atmospheres.  Boma is delicious but loud and busy.  Sanaa is excellent with interesting food and knowledgeable staff to walk you through those interesting options.  Jiko is basically as classy as it gets at WDW with a subdued atmosphere, excellent food, fantastic wine list (Yay Pinotage) and top quality staff.

***But*** a few tips I got for this a long time ago (which I never actually follow, hypocritically enough) include:

- Eat a small meal beforehand. Apparently marijuana may lower blood sugar levels, which can make you hungry. Counteract this by eating a little before you get high.

- Brush your teeth. No one likes to eat *right* after cleaning their mouth. Plus you probably have bong-breath anyway, and no one likes to smell that, lol

- Eat things that don't fill you up and aren't bad for you. This one I actually *do* follow sometimes. I like to eat fruit when I'm stoned because not only is it delicious and refreshing, but fruit is also not very filling and it's much healthier than junk food, so I end up not getting heartburn and such the next day because I can more or less eat all I want with no negative consequences.

- Use a ""filler"". A lot of people in this thread are saying water, which is a good idea. Ingest a ""filler"", or something that has little to no nutritional value, but will still give you a feeling of fullness. ~~Water~~ **Chocolate milk** probably *is* the best option because it can satisfy, it gets rid of cotton-mouth, and it keeps you hydrated, which is *really* important in all aspects of life, but especially if you are stoned. **I remembered at work today that I drink chocolate milk as my filler, and I thought ""Oh crap, I put the wrong information on that dudes post"". Seriously, though, chocolate milk works *wayyyy* better as a filler.**

- Suck on a hard candy or chew some gum. Not only delicious, but hard candies and gum can help satisfy food cravings by tricking your body with the chewing/sucking motions.

"coyk682","Mega bourbon tasting ~~Review #11-20~~ thoughts: EH Taylor Tornado, Rathskeller 25 year, WL Weller '07, Old Weller Antique '90, Eagle Rare 10 101, High West 16, Society of Bourbon Connoisseurs 19yo, Very Old Fitzgerald '67, Very Very Old Fitzged '86, Old Crow 43% ""Traveller's Fifth""

Not really ~~full blown detailed~~ reviews, just overall impressions. 

**EH Taylor Tornado**
Very good buffalo trace mash ill 1 style(my favorite) but not worth the secondary. Close to the small batch/BP. Finish is complex than most. There's a slight fruity undertone that separates it but Honestly fine with my standard BT and EHT SmB/BP
***8/10***
___________________________________________________________________________________

**William Larue Weller 58.9% (research shows 2007)**
So sweet so powerful but smooth. This seems somewhat close to the current BT wheaters (profile wise) like the current 107 though to warrant too much increase in the secondary. Still good and better than most. 
***8.5/10***
____________________________________________________________________________________

**Old Weller Antique 107. 1990 ""gold vein""** 
Holy crap this is so different. It's almost sherry scotch like in its flavors melded with bourbon. Or like bourbon finished in sherry cask, it's not that simple to describe though, it has a certain panache for sure. Very complex. 
***9/10***
_____________________________________________________________________________________

**Eagle Rare 101 - 10 year Lawrenceburg**
Very different than the current ER, though that's expected, but also like the OWA 1990 that it's completely different than any bourbon on the market. There's the old scotch complexities and fruitiness melded with bourbon and spice and wood. Totally unique and delicious. Probably my favorite of the night along with the society bottling. 
***9.5/10***
_______________________________________________________________________________________

**High West 16 Year Rye batch 7**
Sweet gummy delicious smooth. Those words. There's that panache that now I know how that seems to help younger ryes achieve balance in their other blends. Unique. A little too smooth, thus dangerous, but it was my SO's favorite
***8.5/10***
_______________________________________________________________________________________

**Society of Bourbon Connoisseurs 19years**

Sweet and hay-ish. Exemplarary bourbon taste at CS but no burn. No bitter finish whatsoever.  Quintessential bourbon IMO and maybe best of the night  
***9.5/10***
________________________________________________________________________________________

**Rathskeller 25 Year Rye**
Goes on forever. Delicious spicy. No bitterness. Just an endless dance of spice til the end. Bourbony rye. Not sure if I'm sold though. 
***8.5/10***
__________________________________________________________________________________________

**Very Very Old Fitzgerald 12 1986**
Smooth and Touch Of spice. Sweet delicious balanced. Not to sweet but not too spicy. Irish-scotch like but bourbon. Exquisite. 
***9/10***
__________________________________________________________________________________________

**Very Old Fitzgerald 1967**
Hands down best wheater of the night. Smooth but with a kick. Nose taste plate end perfectly on the finish. Lasts forever. 
***9.5/10***
___________________________________________________________________________________________

**Old Crow 4 Year Traveller Set**
I haven't tried the regular current Old Crow, nor do I plan to buy any bottle soon...but this is a nice tasty easy going sipper. Very enjoyable and fairly unique with a certain flavorful youth that doesn't assert itself in the finish.  I have no idea what era this was from and forgot to ask. It's ND juice though, and if the current Old Crow juice was close to this, I'd be drinking it all day long.  
***7/10***

_________________________________________________________________________________________

Thoughts: 

So standout for the nights were the ER 101, OWA 1990 and the bourbon society bottling. The former 2 were nothing like I've ever tasted. Even the VVOF/VOFs I could taste some traces of the current wheat mashbills of today (on another level of course) which you've got to give credit to the Van Winkles for being able to recreate such close profile. The Bourbon Society bottling blows the doors of most of what I tasted that night, extremely balanced...19 years and barrel proof, it shows exemplary quality which I want all bourbons to aspire. High West's 16 year is also very good, and I finally can pinpoint how they've been making their blends have a certain DNA. There's no rye like this I've ever tasted, might be too smooth for some.  

The legendary Rathskeller 25 year rye while good didn't live up to expectations. But maybe I'm not a fan of ultra aged ryes. It does still taste lively and delicious, but it's not something I'd crave for at all. 

Anyway, caveat: suffice to say this should all be taken in context. I had all these wonderful, legendary pours in a span of a little over 3 hours shared with 2 other people. That's honestly not enough time and too much high proof whisky for a single palate to take in. And this is not all of it, we had a few sips of some other stuff plus cocktails and crackers. Maybe if I tasted them by their own at my own leisure at home, some could have most likely gathered very high scores. But at the shoulder of giants and legends, I could have only compared them with one another.

Buttermilk Channel is very popular and is delicious - Monday nights for friend chicken and waffles prix fixe! Their desserts are delicious, too. Colonie on Atlantic is great. 

Burgers: Moo Burger on Court is pretty good. Bareburger on Court is a chain you can find several places in the city, but will satiate a craving for burgers/fries. Same with Shake Shack in downtown Brooklyn. I've never been to Two8Two Burger on Atlantic, but I've heard good things. Watty &amp; Meg on Court has a burger night special on Monday nights!

Chinese: I can't think of too many great Chinese places, but Chance on Smith is good! More of a sit-down place, not quick cheap quick food, but they do deliver.

Desserts: Van Leeuwen on Bergen, right off Smith for ice cream! Brooklyn Farmacy on Henry is this adorable old-Americana soda and shake place - delicious shakes! I've heard good things about Hay Rosie's ice cream - have not been personally. But they do a hot ice cream sandwich! Uncle Louie G on Smith Street for Italian ice is a MUST.

English: Chip Shop on Atlantic Ave.

Ethiopian: Awash on Court is good.

French: Chez Moi on Atlantic. Jolie Cantina on Smith is a French-Mexican fusion restaurant (think lobster tacos) and is good. Cafe Luluc on Smith is good and for some reason, insanely popular for brunch. French Louie on Atlantic isn't what I'd call traditional French food, but it's decent.

Indian: Dosa Royale on Court has good dosas - more of a hipstery-place than your traditional Indian food. Britain Indian on Smith is completely passable, standard Indian.

Italian: Lucali on Henry makes a lot of people's ""best pizza in NYC"" list and is excellent (don't go on a weekend unless you want to wait two or three hours!). Frankie's on Court in Carroll Gardens is awesome and very popular. Brucie on Court is good and their menu changes almost daily. Queen on Court above Atlantic is a nice old-school Italian place. The neighborhood used to be very Italian, so there's some great old school places here - I've heard Ferdinando's Focacceria on Columbia Street by the water is excellent.

Japanese: Hibino on Henry street is awesome and one of the best restaurants in the neighborhood (try their fresh-made fried tofu!), people like Ki Sushi on Smith a lot, too. For ramen, there's Dassara on Smith and Ganso in Downtown Brooklyn, both good.

Mexican: OMG Taco on Smith for quick food. Buddy's Burrito on Court for quick food (and HUGE burritos). Lobo on Court is a decent, sit-down place. Mentioned above, but Jolie-Cantina for French-Mexican.

Misc: Mile End Deli in Boerum Hill is hard to classify (it's technically a ""Jewish"" place, but they do all sorts of food). Ted &amp; Honey is a really cute coffee shop right next to Cobble Hill Park - they have some pastries and sandwiches, too.

Middle Eastern: Yemen Cafe on Atlantic between Court and Clinton. Zaytoons on Smith and Sackett.

Seafood: Bergen Hill on Court St, for sure (pricey). Littleneck in Gowanus on 3rd Avenue is delicious, too.

Spanish: La Vara right by Cobble Hill Park, small plates, delicious but a little pricey.

Thai: Pok Pok on Columbia is insanely popular and delicious. Joya on Court is good for more standard Thai fare.

Vegan: Even if you're not into vegan food, Wild Ginger is definitely worth going to (or getting delivered). The General Tsao's Soy Protein is so good and one of my go-to delivery foods.

Vietnamese: Hanco's on Smith is fast, cheap and good for delivery. Best bahn mi in the neighborhood, IMO.

"ci049m8","Toasting the tortillas on a skillet or comal is awesome. You can even do it over open flame if you are fast and attentive. A little charring is delicious, but you don't want it to dry out and get crispy, so be quick.

Alternatively, you can go hardcore and lightly fry the tortillas in some pork fat. Again, you want to be fast so as to not over fry them to the point when they get crispy (unless you are making crispy tortilla shells, in which case, use a lot more oil and manipulate them with some tongs to create crispy taco shells, and make sure the oil is warm enough so you don't get soggy tortillas, or so hot you burn them, for that matter).  

A light frying in pork fat will make them pliable and delicious. Corn tortillas tend to work better in this this regard. The flour ones you are kind of limited to toasting them on a skillet or open fire. If you get them crispy, they are still good, but they are probably not what you are thinking of when you get a fish taco.

"cgu6yzj","Ok, I'm 5'9"" and 160, and I've been at 175. Are you calling me fat? Because I've not once considered myself fat. 

I've considered myself a little overweight at times, but never fat. 

That brings us to step one for every problem I've encountered in life: be honest with yourself. Don't hype up your problems so you can give yourself a pity party-- that's some bullshit that depression, social anxiety, and a host of other mental conditions use to thrive in your mind. Dig through the bullshit within your head to come to the truth: yeah, you're probably overweight, but the only thing keeping you that way is you. Is that depressing? A little. 

Know what's more depressing? Not doing anything about it. You *are* capable of changing your physical appearance, quite dramatically in fact. 

Summer is coming up. Set a date once school is out. Buy a calendar now and get hyped for it. Circle that date with a big red marker. What is that date? It's the date you start a new daily routine. 

Invest $30 in a set of workout bands ( [the set I use](http://www.amazon.com/Black-Mountain-Products-Resistance-Exercise/dp/7245456313/ref=sr_1_1?s=exercise-and-fitness&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1397677132&amp;sr=1-1) ) off of amazon. I'd also suggest buying a pull up bar, as bands are annoying for those kinds of exercises. Get yourself a solid pair of athletic shorts, some protein powder, some creatine powder, and a whole shitton of powdered gatorade. 

I advise you to buy this because I'm someone who needs a routine to accomplish *anything*, and having the proper equipment and supplements is like lubricant for my resistance to change routines. 

Now that you have everything, you're going to acquire the P90X videos, plans, and diet guide PDFs. Yes, you know how to do this without money because the internet is magical, though if you have the cash to buy them go for it. You don't even need P90X, there are plenty of amazing workout routines. Insanity is another popular set of instructions.

I don't care what stigma you've attached to people who do P90X or Insanity or whatever else. If you're posting on this forum, imma assume you score on the AS. If you score on the AS, chances are you like your routines, as do a lot of other people. Video workouts-- in my experience-- are outrageously useful because it's a prepackaged, professionally planned routine that you can follow or strive for. Follow the diet, too, ESPECIALLY for the first three weeks-- after that you can add in a little wiggle room. If it helps, get your parents in on it. Chances are they'll be your cheerleaders and buy you a bunch of awesomely delicious, but still healthy food. 

So now we have the date marked on the calendar, we have all of our equipment, and we have a routine ready to be followed. The hardest part is holding yourself to it. 

Wake up every morning, get yourself a good, light breakfast, and hit the routine. Follow the diet as closely as you can, counting calories and changing the kinds of meals you eat. If you can't do the day's full workout (god knows I couldn't) don't get down on yourself. Instead, put that energy towards making sure you do better the next day, even if it's just one more pushup. Record your results. Once you break past the three week barrier, you'll find your routine on auto-mode. You'll wake up looking forward to completing the workout, and getting to that beautiful last stretch in the cool down where a bead of well deserved sweat trickles off your nose, and you hit the shower. 

Take a picture of yourself every fucking day. Get a full length mirror, mark where your feet go on the floor, and rest your camera in the same position each time. If you need motivation after the first two weeks, scroll throw those pictures and you can literally watch your body change. After the first month, you'll have enough pictures to see how quickly the change happens. After two months, you'll look forward to taking that fucking picture and comparing it with the one last week. 

After the summer is over and you've completed whatever routine you stuck with, you'll notice some things: you won't feel uncomfortable when people are physically close to you. Smiling becomes easier. Most importantly, when you stand up straight, you'll realize what a confidence boost it really is to hold yourself high. Your teeshirt won't be poking out from a belly, but with newly minted pecs and abs. 

And at the end, when all is said and done, you will realize what a huge effort those ""attractive people"" go through to keep looking that way. You'll also realize what a huge social advantage it is to take the time and effort to invest in your personal appears. Go to Goodwill and buy yourself a couple casual button downs and some tight tee shirts and you'll have more than you can handle. 

Once you understand ""them,"" your hate will start to dissolve. Additionally, you'll probably be a stud. So there's that.

"cg6t0sa","You are correct that pork spoils faster than beef, much faster.  Beef also takes a lot more money per pound of marketable product than pork (at least it used to).  This has left beef as a higher-class product in our culinary development, while we do cure some of the less sought after cuts of beef on occasion, our obsession with the burger leaves us with quicker and more cost effective ways to eliminate the leftover bits of cow than curing. I also think a lot of the reason behind our lack of obsession with fresh pork may come from the fear associated with trichinosis.  Pork loin cooked to a medium doneness is delicious, but how often do you see it on a menu.

Chicken simply is chicken, it's the blandest most cost-effective meat protein there is. We can raise tonnes of it with no concern for space, it's cheap enough that undesirable hatch-lings can simply be ground whole into pet food.  Being so cheap there's very little need or desire to preserve bits of it other than what freezing and the mcnugget can accomplish.  I've had very nice charcuterie products made from other birds like goose and duck, and even in those cases pork fat is often used because it's sweet and delicious.

You must go to the [Blue Door Pub](http://www.thebluedoorpubmn.com/) for lunch.  There are some other places considered classic places, but I promise this is the place.  Head there for a little later lunch, around 1-1:30.  BEER and BURGERS, and the best of both.  You won't be disappointed.  I promise.

[Happy Gnome](http://thehappygnome.com/), mentioned elsewhere, is not only a beer drinker's paradise but also a Whiskey of ALL types paradise.

Moscow On the Hill(http://moscowonthehill.com/) has every vodka possible.

Seriously, the mall is just big.  Its a mall, like all others.  The difference is there's an amusement park inside.  So if you're into rides go do that.  Also there's a Lego place where you can spend a looong time if you're into that.  Otherwise, meh.

obsidianop down the way has given you GREAT advice.  Northeast has amazing beer and food, AND dive bars!

As for just staying downtown St. Paul:

[Amsterdam](http://www.amsterdambarandhall.com/) is cool, usually find some music down there at night.

There's a Thai place called Sawatdee that everyone loves and has multiple spots in the cities.  But you should go to what we call ""Dirty Thai"", because its not the nicest looking place, but the food is amazing...[Ruam Mit Thai](http://www.yelp.com/biz/ruam-mit-thai-saint-paul-2).  Try the Papaya salad or the Laab Kai as traditional and delicious, but everything's great.

Most popular sushi is [Fuji-Ya](http://www.fujiyasushi.com/).  But the best, in the opinion of someone who lived in Japan for a year, is [Sakura](http://www.sakurastpaul.com/)

[The Bulldog Lowertown](http://thebulldoglowertown.com/) is totally a place for beer.  They have dozens of taps and as many bottles.  Nice grub, loud vibe, almost sports bar but not.  Go for the Italian Hot Beef Sandwich, get it wet with Giardinera.  Tater tots are very popular in the cities and they have multiple flavor varieties.  Also, the aforementioned [Barrio](http://barriotequila.com/barrio/#!/BarrioLowertown) is right next door but its small plates and can get pricey.  But...EVERY Tequila is there.  ALL OF THEM.

[Red's Savoy Pizza](http://savoypizza.com/location/minnesota/st-paul-7th-street/) is a total dive of a pizza place and is arguably the BEST gutbomb pizza in existence.  Also very close to your hotel.

Thin crust artesinal pizza with amazing beer choices leaves you with [Black Sheep Pizza](http://blacksheeppizza.com/).  Really good.

BREAKFAST- [The Buttered Tin](http://thebutteredtin.com/).  The lady who opened this place won that show Cupcake Wars like twice.  Delicious...but a little pricey.

The least known but amazing food, if you're into Japanese food, is [Tanpopo](http://tanpoporestaurant.com/) No other place in the cities take me back to Japan like this place.  Just delicious umami.

But, pros far outweigh cons I believe. Your healthier diet can be just as diverse and delicious, but you can still indulge with friends on things like pizza and sweets.

My vegetarianism is influenced by these factors, but it boils down to this: most of us live in a world where we don't have to kill other creatures in order to be fed. Alternatives are everywhere and to me, there are so many good reasons to switch over.

&gt;On a day off of work (and modafanil) I can't help but binge on carbs and sugar and sleep the entire day away. It's not a fulfilling sleep, but the desire is relentless.

This sounds like self-destructive addictive behavior.  You will be happier in the long run if you break out of this pattern and figure out a better way to manage your symptoms on the days that you take off from modafnil.  People do get addicted to carbs and sugar, but it is probably not the same as being addicted to crack for most people.  If the addiction is that strong for you, you might ask your doctor about an other medication to use on your days off.  There are meds that lessen the urge of addiction for things like smoking (for example Wellbutrin) but I have no idea whether they would be compatible with N and Wellbutrin is known to affect sleep.

If you feel that knocking down a bowl of pasta and sleeping all weekend is something that you could deal with without additional medication, then do it.

brown rice with frozen peas in the cooker. just add the veggies when the rice is nearly done. then ill cook a chicken breast in the oven, or just throw some bag style veggies (i get a broccoli, carrot, snowpea mix for about $3) in a pan with a little water. add some seasoning or soy sauce to taste. 

with the same stir fry idea, i like to use a sushi style rice, like jasmine. its sticky and delicious, but not as good for you as brown rice. wash it, rinse it, throw it in the cooker. 

Always keep a jar of peanut butter.  The natural kinds are better, cause they are lower in sugars and fats, but they also come at a cost. A jar of regular peanut butter will do, and provides some essential proteins and carbs.  It does have fats in it though, so dont over do it. great on bread or celery or rice cakes or even in stir fry (i make alot of stir fry)

If you have a whole foods or like a coop market around, you can get quinoa by weight for fairly cheap. it provides a good amount of protein, its filling, and you can put basically anything in it to add flavor, or eat it alone with some soy sauce or salt. also cooks in that rice cooker. 

Pasta is an idea, especially for students, cause its filling and has high carbs that will keep you fueled for a while. Its just not very good for you, so try to limit it if your trying to stay toned. When i was in college staying alive was more important than my physical appearance, so i ate alot of pasta. you can cook up some noodles and keep them in a container and then just add sauce to them, as you nuke them, so your not always eating the same dish. get a jar of alfredo or tomato sauce, or just melt some cheese (velvetta works great) in some milk and a little butter to make a macaroni cheese sauce. 

for breakfast, consider a whole wheat english muffin and a egg or two. Its light, but offers protein and carbs to get you going. egg whites would be best but an egg or two a day isnt going to kill your diet.

Salads are easy, straight forward, and can be absolutely delicious but I have some other ideas for different meals. Now, stick with me 'cause some of these sound weird, but I promise they are delicious. 

 Scrambled eggs with wilted spinach is one of my favorites and as easy as it sounds.  Heat skillet, throw spinach on it for a minute to wilt it, whisk eggs and throw them on top of wilted spinach and scramble together.

Shakes.  I like to start my day with a protein shake.  This opens a vast world of possibilities if you like this route including spinach, kale, pumpkin, etc.  I won't expand on this with recipes unless you're interested.

Squash.  I've been finding squash is an amazing thing.  Spaghetti squash steamed with a touch of butter and a tiny bit of salt and pepper to taste is amazing.  Other options would be grilling/baking squash.  I tend to use fairy tale squash, pumpkin, zucchini, or yellow squash for this.  Cut it into nice bite size pieces or slices, toss in olive oil, sprinkle with salt and pepper, and throw in the oven at like 350 for 20 minutes, or until tender.  Its really delicious.  Many of the squash preparations I use call for salt, but just be careful not to over do it.  A little salt will go a really long way and you definitely don't want to over do your sodium.  If you don't want to use salt try other herbs or spices like garlic.  Really you can't go wrong with squash.

Also- you don't need to put food to waste.  Buy one or two servings of a vegetable to start if you aren't sure you like it.  You don't need to buy a weeks worth of food.

Think of it this way. You have a cake that's baked with a mixture of half garbage (like, literally garbage from the trash can) and half with high quality ingredients. Some bites are going to be absolutely delicious, but most of it is going to taste like garbage. Or, there's a cake made wholly from mediocre ingredients. It's not the best cake in the world, but, no garbage in your mouth. 

Unleashed is the garbage cake. Colors is the mediocre cake. 

So, this should forestall what I take is where you may have been trying to go. If we average Unleashed's to halves we get 'meh' and Colors is 'meh' so they're the same. I just don't think that that's right. Colors at least manages to be competently designed the whole way through and manages *at least* 'meh' the whole way through. It wins the quality battle. Making it more than a 'meh' experience.

Ingredients:

* Pre sliced beef strips
* Hoisin Sauce

* Avocado

Instructions:
 
1. Cook beef strips until they turn brown in a wok. Stir every 30 seconds ish and at the same time peel and grate your carrots.

2. When the meat is brown add Hoisin sauce and crushed chilli paste. I add 2-4 table spoons of hoisin sauce and 1-2 table spoons of chili paste for 1kg of meat, however this depends on the strength of both and I normally start with 2 and 1 respectively and then add more after I have tasted it.

3. Cook the meat/sauce down until most of the liquid released buy the meat has been cooked off and you are left with a sticky dark brown ""mess"" that tastes delicious.

4. Combine the meat and the salad/cheese in the wrap for a delicious and extremely easy meal.

It seems like brownies have always been with us -- moist, thick, rich and delicious. But every good recipe has an inventor, and brownies are no exception. To find out where they came from, we must visit the Palmer House hotel in Chicago.  

It seems that in 1892, Mrs. Palmer required a special dessert for the upcoming Chicago World's Fair and her pastry chefs came up with the brownie. To this day, the hotel uses the same recipe for its signature dessert, so don't go looking for any boxes of brownie mix in the kitchen cupboard.  

**The Palmer House Hilton Chocolate Fudge Brownie**  
1 pound, 2 ounces semisweet chocolate  
1 pound butter  
1 pound, 8 ounces granulated sugar  
8 ounces cake flour  
1 tablespoon baking powder  
4 eggs  
1 pound crushed walnuts  

For Glaze  
1 cup water  
1 cup apricot preserves  
1 teaspoon unflavored gelatin  

Melt chocolate with butter in double boiler. Mix dry ingredients, except walnuts, into mixing bowl. Mix chocolate with dry ingredients, 4 to 5 minutes. Add eggs. Pour into 9-x12-inch baking sheet, sprinkle walnuts on top, press walnuts down slightly with your hand and bake in a preheated oven at 300 degrees for 30 to 40 minutes.   

You will know the brownie is done when the edges start to become a little crispy and the brownie has risen about quarter-inch. Note that even when the brownie is properly baked, it will test ‚Äúgooey‚Äù with a toothpick in the middle due to the mixture‚Äôs richness.   

After removing from oven, allow to cool for about 30 minutes before spreading a thin layer of glaze with a pastry brush. Glaze: Mix together water, preserves and unflavored gelatin in a saucepan. Mix thoroughly and bring to a boil for 2 minutes. Use hot.

- Mother and I are talking again!  She called me and apologized for what she had said in the past.  While it wasn't a full apology (she was still making excuses for her behavior), it was good enough for me to accept.  I reiterated my boundaries, and she's accepted that.  She knows I'm completely willing to stop talking to her should she disregard those boundaries again.

- I got ""OK'd"" to do some small scale landscaping in the front yard of the home my SO and I rent.  It'll be slow going because I have an injury that makes physical activity hard, but gardening is one of my favorite things.  I'm starting with small projects that can be completed quickly, or that I can dictate to my SO, or that can be done in a few hours spread over a few days.  I have to wait until Friday to start: I'll be picking up some potting soil and pots so I can move some geraniums to a nice, sunny spot so they can flower.  

- I made shish-kebabs the other weekend, and chili with cornbread this weekend.  Both were delicious!  My SO said the cornbread was perfect. :D


---------------------------

Shish-Kebab recipe:

- 2 cups Tomato **JUICE**
- 1 1/2 cups Distilled White Vinegar
- 1/4 cup yellow mustard (French's brand)
- 2 tsp White, granulated sugar
- 2 tsp salt **if no salt in juice, or to taste**
- 1/2 tsp Ground Black Pepper

&amp;

- Top Sirloin Steak (1.75lbs = 12 kebabs)
- Whatever veggies you want!  I use white mushrooms, cherry/grape tomatoes, red and green bell pepper, and yellow onion.  You don't need to mess with the white mushrooms (I even leave the stem on), but the bell peppers and onion need to be cut up into **large** pieces.  You can also add pineapple, but I'm not a fan so I exclude it.
- Skewers!  Wooden skewers are $1 per 100 at Walmart.

Mix the ingredients in the first list.  Cut the steak(s) into 1 - 1 1/2 inch cubes.  Place the steaks in a glass dish (or large zip lock baggie), cover with the marinade and let them sit **12 hours or more** in the fridge.

Assemble the kebabs however you like, with 2 or 3 pieces of meat.  If you're doing 3 pieces of meat, I prefer to ""start"" and ""end"" the kebab with meat (so, it'll be meat-onion-tomato-bell pepper-meat-bell pepper-mushroom-onion-meat).  If you're doing 2 pieces of meat, I prefer to have veggies on either side (so, mushroom-bell pepper-onion-meat-bell pepper-tomato-onion-meat-onion-bell pepper-mushroom).

After assembling the kebabs you need to BBQ them!  Put your left over marinade in a bowl and bring out a brush.  I cook the kebabs either 5 minutes on one side, then 3 on the other, or 7 &amp; 7.  5 &amp; 3 leaves you with medium-rare meat, VERY tender and delicious, but doesn't char the veggies.  7 &amp; 7 puts your meat at ""done,"" but gets a bit of char on the veggies (which is delicious on the onion and mushroom, imho).  You may need to experiment with times for your grill (we use a simple, classic charcoal grill).

While grilling, remember to brush on the marinade *at least* every time you flip.  Tomato juice isn't thick, so it doesn't protect the meat as well as a thick sauce.

Corn Bread:

**Dry Ingredients**:

- 1 1/2 cups All-Purpose Flour
- 2/3 cup Yellow Cornmeal
- 2/3 cup Sugar
- 1 tbsp baking powder (NOT baking soda, which is what you keep in your fridge)
- 1/2 tsp salt

Mix all dry ingredients together in a large bowl.

**Wet Ingredients**:

- 1 1/4 cups Milk
- 2 Large Eggs
- 1/3 cup Vegetable Oil
- 3 tbsp Butter (soft)

Mix all wet ingredients together in a small or medium sized bowl.

Combine the wet and dry ingredients.  Bake 350 degrees Fahrenheit (176.667 C).  If you want your cornbread really sweet (like a dessert!), sprinkle some extra sugar on top after 15 minutes of baking.  The cornbread will be done when it's golden brown on top and a knife or toothpick comes out clean (sorry I don't have exact times on this, I always check every 10-15 minutes).

"caix7z6","As a disclaimer, I'm a vegetarian, so I'm biased toward one answer.  But please recognize that those who eat meat are biased toward justification of their actions as well.

I personally think that eating meat is unethical, on the basis that it causes more suffering than utility.  From personal experience, I can verify that vegetarian food can be awesome and delicious.  But I'll try to examine the issue as neutrally as is possible for me.  So let's try and look at the numbers:

Simplifying somewhat, we can say that there are 2000 quarter pound burgers per cow ([source](http://ask.metafilter.com/27259/How-much-meat-is-there-on-a-cow)).  According to [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy_cattle) a cow is typically killed for meat around age 4, or about 1400 days.  So each burger takes up about 16 cow hours.  I'll spare you the gruesome details about [factory farm](http://www.aspca.org/fight-animal-cruelty/farm-animal-cruelty/what-is-a-factory-farm.aspx) conditions, but suffice to say that they are generally not pleasant for the animals.  

So the question you have to ask is ""when I eat a burger, is that worth 16 hours of a cow suffering?""  Cows are not the brightest animals in the world, so it's fair to discount their suffering, but in my opinion, it is not.  I would not abuse a domestic cat or dog for fun, and I consider the terrible living conditions of farm animals to be no different.  

To those who say that eating meat is justifiable because it provides them with nourishment and pleasure, I would liken this to those who say that dog fighting is justifiable because it provides them with enjoyment.  It is entirely possible to eat great and have fun without hurting animals.

"c9x37xr","My thoughts on the recipes I tried, as they appeared in the book:

**Salad at Castle Black:** All the chick peas and raisins roll to the bottom of the bowl. Hard to get a good mixed forkful! Dressing is boring.

**Buttered Beets:** Nice simple dish.

**Modern Turnips in Butter:** A bit too sharp-tasting for me. Probably due to raw garlic and natural taste of the turnips. Some of the turnips were fibrous and added an unpleasant texture.

**Honeyed Chicken:** Tasty and I surprisingly liked the sweet savoury sauce (it's the chicken in the pic). When I made it, the sputtering fat filled my place with acrid smoke. Putting foil down or something would help. Also, I was worried that the sauce wasn't reducing enough and ended up over-reducing it. It turned into something jammy, but if you nuke it in the microwave it becomes saucy again.

**17th Century Baked Apples:** Basic baked apple. Tasty!

**Modern Blueberry Tart:** Simple and delicious, but I don't see much point in adding uncooked berries on top. And my berries didn't burst or get all leaky and delicious.

**Medieval Poached Pears:** I love poached pears.

**Medieval Honey Biscuits:** Fried dough. Meh.

**Modern White Beans and Bacon:** Tasty, looked like a mess. Good on toast.

**Almond Crusted Trout:** A bust. Didn't taste like almonds at all. My ""crust"" looked like cat vomit.

**Elizabethan Lemon Cakes:** The dough was waaaaaaay too dry. I had to mix in a lot of oil to even get it to barely hold together. Turned out super hard because of how much I handled the dough.

**Duck with Lemons**: I used chicken. The glaze made the skin of the chicken taste incredible, but there wasn't enough glaze to use as a sauce.

TL;DR: I recommend the honeyed chicken, poached pears, and maybe try the modern lemon cake recipe. Mulled wine is very thematic and there is a recipe in the book, but I just ended up finding a simpler recipe on the internet and making that. Buttered beets or the buttered carrots would be a good side dish.",1368328440,"and my berries didn't burst or get all leaky and delicious.","leaky and delicious","delicious",NA,FALSE,"leaky and delicious","leaky",NA,NA,0

"c9qckia","Dear Goddesses, where to start.  
I have watched Anime as young as 5 years old but I had *no* idea where the cartoons came from.  
I assumed that they where either from the United States (under a different style) or Mexican (specially Dragon Ball Z which has become such a part of our culture that people would actually vote for Goku on the past elections.)    
So, my Godfather was actually who corrected me and told me that it came from the Magical land of Japan and that the kind of drawings I was doing where 'Manga'.  
Thus began my magical quest to become a Manga-ka ~~and under my standards I am so fair flailing~~.  
Not only did I want to admire the whole Anime culture, but my dad used to work for Sony, so I had certain books on Japanese Manufacturing clauses, rules and culture; Japanese culture in general and history; Japanese geography. This just made my interest pike more and forget learning Russian (this is a long story actually) and decide to learn Japanese on my own. I was 11 when I took the decision and so far I have not only learned the language (somewhat, my kanji is horrible and while my pronunciation is ok I have problems making coherent sentences at times), but I know how to bow properly, making and differences the different types of dishes - soba, udon, teriyaki, tamagoyaki, etc - all in a certain hope of not just fangasming on Japanese stuff, but immerse myself fully.   
I do not think I can stop being a Gaijin ever, nor that I will reach the level of respect as many of the real Japanese Manga-ka but Japan will always have a place in my heart as the land that brought to me so many things in life.

"c9j5xnz","One of my favorite foods! And pretty healthy too, especially for a cheap college student like me.

Of course, guacamole. There are tons of recipes, my favorite that's easy to improvise on a budget and all my friends rave about is to mash up an avocado or two, lime juice to taste, a small clove of chopped/minced garlic, some diced onion, and salt to taste. You can sub with garlic powder/salt, onion powder, lemon juice as backup and just use whatever amounts that you prefer. Add to sandwiches, burgers, chips, nachos, tacos, etc. Some people add chopped up tomatoes/peppers or salsa but I'm not really a fan. 

Add sliced avocado to grilled cheese, burgers, turkey sandwiches, salads. Avocado BLTs are delicious, have for breakfast with an egg and cheese on toast too.

My other favorite recipe is to grill avocados. I thought warm avocados would be gross and I was SO wrong. I haven't yet tried them in a frying pan but it should probably work. Just spray the pan, cut the avocados in half (remove the pit), brush the face of each with olive oil/lime juice and cook face down in the pan on medium heat for about five minutes or until they seem pretty heated. Then add whatever you've got, lime juice/salt, a dollop of sour cream or salsa to the middle, eat with chips. or a spoon.

"c8gwnfx","I mentioned this in another thread a month or so ago, but it's actually more relevant here.

I spent time teaching English in rural Vietnam last year which was an incredible experience but a total shock to the system for the following reasons:

* I was way out in the country where nobody spoke English. I had learned some basic Vietnamese so I could hold a conversation, but I always worried what I'd do in an emergency. Had to resort to drawing pictures a few times (once to request a kettle). I think it was just unnerving more than anything else. Of course I knew English would be limited before I went to Vietnam, I just didn't realise how much it would effect me. The first thing I did when I returned to Ha Noi was turn on TV and Australian Masterchef was playing. I'd never been so happy to watch annoying people cook.

* The food did a number on me. I'm not really a fussy eater and I love Vietnamese food. Everything I ate over there was really fresh and delicious, but after 20+ years of eating the same kind of diet every day, going to a diet based around noodles and rice was a bit of a shock to my system. Lots of carbs, not much of anything else, without going out of my way to find foods rich in calcium and iron especially. 

* Out in the country, many of the people, particularly children, had never seen a white person before. They were all really lovely and shouted ""HELLO"" at me when I walked past their houses, but some would just stare at me constantly.

* A few older people refused to serve me at markets in Ha Noi because I'm white. I'm not going to get all 'omg racism!' or anything,  I just moved on. Once I went to buy fruit and the woman running the stall yelled ""no American!!"" I'm Australian, but just left. There were a few times where older people would walk past me and glare, muttering under their breaths. My Vietnamese isn't good enough to know what they were saying, but I know it wasn't nice. This behaviour didn't really bother me per se, I see where they're coming from.

"c8e93df","Chocolate ganache. You know that fancy-pants thing they charge you ten dollars per spoonful in classy restaurants? It consists of heavy cream and really damn good chocolate blended together in a 1:1 ratio. 

Get the best cream you can find and gently heat the cream on the stovetop. Do not allow it to boil. Chop the chocolate into small bits (no larger than your pinky nail), and pour the hot cream over it. Stir constantly. If you did it right, the chocolate will melt and magically swirl into the cream in seconds. **Please note:** When you're using a small number of ingredients in a dish, it becomes more important that you get the best you can get your hands on. You might find a bar of Hershey's delicious, but trust me when I say that you'll like Scharffenberger better in this. (ETA: As an aside, the lack of adherence to quality is why so many Italian restaurants are horrors.)

And hey. Do you guys know about those two famous French dishes that nobody in America knows how to pronounce properly? Coq au vin and boeuf bourguignon? 

They're both mostly the same thing, and they mostly involve a shitload of chopping. You turn on the oven, chop stuff while it heats, brown the meat, add the wine and stock, toss it into a casserole or a Dutch oven, and forget about it until it becomes a wonderful pile of deliciousness that you'll pay upwards of thirty dollars for in a decent establishment. You can reduce the gravy and make it even more concentrated and delicious, or choose not to. I like Julia Child's version. I use rump roast for the BB.

The most important thing about both of those recipes is *not buying shitty wine* to cook it in. Go budget with the meat/veg if you have to (I don't recommend it!), but *don't buy plonk.* No stuff marked ""cooking wine."" No. Bad. Never cook with that shit, it's a gimmick to sell the worst of the worst. Buy something you'd be willing to drink.

"c87p0qs","Bars:

Stonewall is popular with students and also stinks.  Same statement applies to College Bar and Willie's.  Outlaws and Tumbleweeds are popular for line dancing and country music.  Zannotti's Wine Bar and Finnegan's are the only places that don't smell, as well as Ibiza, which is new and the most like a club.  Louie's is a bar with good drunk food.  Fuzzy's is a Mexican restaurant with a bar and good Mexican drunk food.  They also serve breakfast at any time.

Restaurants:

Hideaway is delicious but expensive.  Thai Cafe is a great price for what you get.  You must try the ginger salad dressing and the vegetable soup.  Grannie's Kitchen is a hole-in-the-wall with great breakfast and brunch.  Most of the chain restaurants are consistently mediocre.  Which which is on campus, in the Kerr-Drummond food area, but is tasty.  Pizza West has good pizza, too, but only for the West side of town.  Go to Da Vinci's, not Olive Garden, for Italian food.  Go to Aspen Coffee, not Starbucks, for coffee.  Blue Spruce is a new place that sells gelato and pour-over hot drinks. 

Tips:  

Don't speed on 6th or 19th.  People drive like fools on Perkins, so look out.  Don't speed anywhere in or directly around campus (or on any street adjacent to OSU property).

OSU and the local bars are the only places that host unique events and live music.  Check OSU's website's calendar, follow the local businesses if you're into that Twitter sort of thing, or check on their Facebooks.  Look at the Hastings calendar, as well.  Subscribe to the okstate subreddit for Reddit meet-ups and event postings.

Beware of driving between 12:45 a.m. and 3 a.m. - especially if you've had *anything* to drink.  (In which case, you really shouldn't be driving, anyway.)  If you have to drive around that time, then make sure everything with your car is in working order and that you remember all your driver's ed.  Also beware of being around The Strip (Washington), around those hours.

The liquor on 6th St. between Sangre and Country Club has good prices.  Brown's Bottle Shop is decently priced, too.

Because you aren't a student, you will have to rely on the newspapers and websites for job postings.  OSU's HR section of the school's website has job postings.

As far as other unique stuff, goes, I am personally trying to breath some life and variety into Stillwater - along with fellow musicians and dancers.  I hope that, in the next couple of months, there will be a lot more interesting events to attend.

"c8791vn","This is so much harder than you would think, doing the independent dinners thing.  And more expensive, as the OP mentioned.  When my husband was doing Keto (and I was doing nothing), I did sometimes find my own food, because I didn't want all the extra fat (in addition to carbs-- I was quite pro-sugar, pro-bread at the time -- calm down, I know, fat isn't bad)... and it meant having two sets of groceries, or one set and the other person eats out (me, since Keto and restaurants don't play nicely together).  

I would eat his Keto dinners sometimes (which were usually super cheesy and delicious), but I didn't feel great afterwards, so it wasn't something I enjoyed.

"c7l1cci","Female here, 22 years old, been lifting/exercising/researching for about 6 years.  

As far as diet, what I've found has worked best at both losing weight and keeping weight off is definitely cutting the carbs.  Breads and pastas are fantiastic and delicious, but only in very small amounts should you eat them.  Look into the paleo diet subreddit.  Vegetable and meat are the go-to foods for this diet, and although it might be hard to adapt to, it's well worth at least trying.  I have been on sort of a ""version"" of this diet for a couple weeks, and I look and feel great.  Give yourself a cheat day or a cheat meal.  Life seems a lot less bleak if you do this :)

As far as exercise, I can't give you any set routine, only a few pointers.  Definitely mix weightlifting and cardio in together, but alternate.  Lift one day, do cardio the next day.  If your joints can handle it, do HIIT for your cardio at least once a week.  It does WONDERS to your abs, and I highly recommend sprints.  And when weightlifting, try not to go longer than an hour.  Give it all you've got in that amount of time, and you WILL get the results you want.  Overtraining is thing.  It exists. Lifting heavier will make you stronger and ""bigger"", lifting lighter weights will give you more of a lean muscle gain.

Get the cheapest meal plan with the most flex dollars. It's unfortunate that you have to purchase a meal plan because Bob's is really low quality. Denny's is convenient and delicious but I gained about 10-15 pounds off freakin' grand slamwhich's last year before I figured out that I was just eating fats-on-fats-on-fats.

If you can afford to go the LLC route instead of the dorms I recommend it. I spent a very limited time over in Wallace and I couldn't stand it. The tower was more comfortable when I visited and it seemed like the better option of the two. The LLC was great and there is a lot more privacy available.

I went Greek this year, not the best choice to make as a senior, but I'm very glad I did it. If you're considering it, make sure you explore your options; I found a great house for me and I love it but I'd recommend rushing your freshman or sophomore year. Do not underestimate the amount of work created by your freshman year at a fraternity, and probably a sorority. There are houses that are clones of one another and there are houses that are melting pots. Just find where your comfortable, and don't just join a house because you have a friend in it.  

If using university housing, be realistic and specific when describing your ideal roommate. There are some dirty motherfuckers out there that will make your life hell if you get a bad fit.

If you want to leave university housing be thoughtful of where you're looking at living. Pick somewhere close to campus to the point you can walk or ride a bike, perhaps somewhere that is near a bus stop for the winter. The grove is nice, but it kind of sucks due to the management. 
--------
Classes
--------
Try to collect as much information about the professors you are taking. If you do not like your professors you will not do as well as if you had a positive relationship with them. I'd also recommend taking teachers who's style of lecture grips your attention the most. 

Ex: In the political science department; 
Professor Lund is a very knowledgeable resource, but his teaching style is very old school and it is almost impossible to pay attention in his class. 
Professor Wilson has a more active and involved teaching style who commands your attention. He only allows laptops in the front row, and it is not difficult to take pen and paper notes with him. He also lets you know what is important to focus on. 

I could give my opinions on some teachers in the business department and such but I don't want to make this section too long. My hope was just to emphasize this factor.

At the beginning of each semester read the fucking syllabus's. Figure out in the first week if you can handle the work load and do your best to understand what type of work is expected of you. 

Figure out how to advise yourself and utilize the degree audit. Plan ahead as much as you can. 

Utilize a spreadsheet each semester to track your grades so you always know where you are in a class. This can provide motivation and is the soul reason I have never received a grade lower than a B. It may seem tedious but it can immensely improve your GPA and focus your attention when necessary. 


Figure out if you can handle online classes. If you can get yourself to do the work then you will be fine. Many people sign up for these classes and then forget about them: Don't be this person. 
-------
Books
-------

Google your books. More often than not I have found free copies of my books online. Especially in philosophy classes; however, I have found economics, business, accounting, political science, and biology textbooks that I needed as well.

Chegg your books if you have to buy them; the bookstore is a huge ripoff.

If you do buy your books at the bookstore - consider keeping some of the texts that relate to your major. In all likelihood you're going to receive about 15% of what you paid for the book (max). I stopped selling my political science books last year because there have been countless occasions that I have been able to use them as references and sources for later classes.

----
Life
----

Utilize the rec center, especially in the winter.

I recommend taking a vitamin D supplement in the winter because shit can get depressing down here. Staying in shape also combats depression.

When you party, party safe. I don't recommend blacking out the first time hanging out with a new group of people. Don't drink-and-drive, it's just too risky - even if you're confident in your ability to drive drunk, you cannot be confident in the abilities of others or the reliability of your car. Headlight out? Life's going to be really difficult for awhile.

Try to stay out of the school's probation system - it's annoying and stressful. Be smart about drinking in the dorms, if you have a shitty RA just don't drink in your hall/building. 

Make friends, find stuff that you enjoy and keep doing it. 

Girls, go out with reliable friends - be safe. 

I've often heard - sleep, grades, or a social life; pick two. Most times this is true, but I've found it quite easy to receive all three - figure out the study habits that work best for you and choose class times that you'll actually make it to. Unfortunately, 11:30 is sometimes just too damn early.

Gong Gi Wa (sp) is an amazing Korean BBQ (grilled spice pork, grilled spiced beef, mmmmm) Plus they keep the Soju coming.

Not really fancy but m favorite place for quick good curry is Go Curry! in Pacific Place or in Cilandak Square. I equate it to the Subway of Curry but it is really good. 

I'm not a fan of fish but if you like Seafood, Santiga Baru on Jl. Benhil in Benhil is probably the best you can get in Jakarta especially for the price.

For Mexian you have two options (Some people will tell you three but....Chilis is NOT Mexican....): Hacienda (In Senayan Arcadia) and Amigos (Several locations). And really between those two you only have one option... Hacienda. 10 times better than Amigos and around the same price. Definitely try out their homemade tableside Guacamole.

Middle Eastern food there's a few decent options: Beirut (I can't remember which street it's on; but it's somewhere east of Jl Thamrin...maybe Haji Agus Salim?), Extremely Good Shisha (they also have Shisha surprisingly) and the restaurant inside the Le Meridian hotel (the best option in the city. This is where the Iraqi Ambassador told me I have to eat at. Also the most expensive, but not too bad)

There's also Marche in Plaza Senayan - Don't go there for the pizzas though (although they are fine, unique in Jakarta due to the crust which is nice), go there for the Roasties (sp?).

F: Deep burn for medium length. Got some rice pudding going on after a few sips and some bitter nuttiness, cherry syrup, burnt Styrofoam

O: The nose and taste on this leaves a little bit to be desired. You really have to dig in the nose. I don't know which way this bourbon sways whether it is sweet, floral, spicy or bitter. My palate is having a hard time discerning. The initial taste is sweet and delicious but quickly devolves into bitterness. The bitter part is what is off putting and makes the tannins in the bourbon harsher. The good news is that it isn't very woody tannins, which means that something good is going on here and that is the finish. It is deep, decently long and flavorful. A lovely nutty, cereal finish that I enjoy in most whiskey. It's drinkability and enjoyable finish steps this offering up a bit, but I think I will finish this bourbon as a mixer. It has some nice flavors to sip neat, but occasionally some of the undesirable notes will rear its head.

"c65pa2v","Now this is my kinda post! Honestly, at your bachelorette party ask your girls to do a stock the bar theme. Collect a bottle from everyone before the wedding for use at the wedding. I help brides figure out their hosted bars for a living. You can view all kinds of examples of wedding bars on my site from very cheap to very expensive. www.austinbarco.com

My honest opinion, being it is my job to provide unique bars/bartenders is that a hosted bar is the nicest and most tasteful route. You will have to invest in the bar anyways, you may or may not make back what you spend. Having done cash bars, not a lot of people care to drink as they are not expecting to have to pay for drinks (in my experience). BYOB and cash bars might be most affordable but having an open bar just makes for more fun for the guests. Putting a ""BYOB"" it on the invite will give those drinking a heads up for sure and is not distasteful just less fun for the guests. You can cut costs by getting a keg, cheap champagne ($3 a bottle of Andre or something). A beer and wine bar is the cheapest and signature drinks are great conversation starters for guests. Long islands are strong and delicious but costly in that you need several liquors to make a good one. Do a drink that goes with your cuisine or something that you love, or even something like a punch or sangria to keep costs down. Having a bar menu on display really fancies things up no matter what you serve if you choose to create your own bar. I have seen people do a keg and cheap red and whites for under $300 for a guest count of around 100 or so which has worked fine. I have also seen people spend thousands, doing an all out full bar. No matter the case anything left over usually never goes to waste.

Check with your venue to see what they allow and what people have done in the past. Hope my advice helps, I love my career in doing this for brides. Also, investigate your bartender if you are choosing someone you do not know. You dont want some ass without a personality handling your libations!

I've tried it when someone else has made it from the oven and honestly, the taste was lacking. That may be the fault of the cook.

That said, I'm against it simply because Alton Brown recommended it on Good Eats. I loved Good Eats and I think Alton is great but he's making stuff for a show...he's most likely trying to show a simpler way to produce something with an *acceptable* flavor rather than scare the hell out of someone that is new to making it.

I've tried a lot of stuff that Alton has done and they are acceptable and even delicious, but then you learn to make this the long and proper way and you can taste the difference.

I would bet Alton doesn't do Roux in the oven even though he showed it on Good Eats. It's not that it's bad, it's that it isn't as good as the traditional method.

"c5xrmqa","Pinot grigio is a dry, low acidity wine, which loosely translates to: It doesn't have that much flavor. This is not a bad thing and good PGs are subtle and delicious. But any sweet dessert, and especially chocolate, will drown it. Something mild like a flan or similar custard perhaps? Fresh fruit are ideal, and even cooked fruit desserts like pies might be ok, as long as they aren't too sweet.

Another option is to pair it with a cheese plate. It's a very continental dessert, but surprisingly satisfying. Again, keep it light. No bleu cheeses or aged-washed rinds. But some Camembert and maybe a little Chevre, would pair nicely.

"c5xrh26","you can't be drinking beer on a raw diet. bad news for the guts. a little wine here and there wont kill you if you keep it to about a glass or two every few days or so. 

smoothies or fruit for breakfast, maybe two meals of this, 
salads for lunch/dinner. 

if you get bored with that line up there are a bajillion raw recipes online that are creative and delicious, but for the most part they're really prep-heavy and somewhat difficult to incorporate into a normal busy lifestyle. Keep it simple if you want to succeed and don't worry about how much you're eating. until all the toxins are out, eat 100% raw and you WILL lose the weight. probably faster than you will believe. 

make sure you're getting enough calories 2500(f) or 3000 (m)

make sure you're eating about 1/2-2 lb of green leafy veg PER DAY. 1/2 of that could be incorporated into juices. otherwise you will feel great for a month or more maybe but you won't be getting enough minerals to support all the fruit. 

don't over eat on fats. one handful of nuts per day is plenty. one avocado is plenty. the temptation is to eat sugar, salts, and fats when you let go of junkfoods because your body will detoxify, and it might feel uncomfortable. we cling to these tasty foods for comfort. try no to over do it, but if it's between too many nuts once in  a while, or a cheeseburger you know where to go. 

do the best you can with what you can and above all don't obsess about getting it perfect. give yourself time and breathing room to adjust. the first couple of weeks on 100% can be really amazing, englightenning, and a bit of a drug in itself when the raw high kicks in. try to take it all gracefully. it might get rough. you might get a little emotional at times as memories and habbits are tied to tissues in the body. we store our emotions in the body as well as the brain and when you heal your body you enevitably heal your mind. the repressed spychological junk tends to slip out if you don't watch for it. embrace it. it's all part of detox. 

imo, the best way to get through detox is to face all of it, and start journaling. once you're over the detox hump you'll likely forget about how it felt and what you thought about. references to the beginning stages never hurt down the road when  you get a little tempted. 

remember that you're doing it because you love yourself and want to take responsibility for your health because ultimately no one else really can.

"c5v1prf","I stayed there for my birthday in June and they were very nice to me. You can check in without even going to the lobby.  The guards never asked to see a room key when going to the hotel elevators. We asked them where a good dessert place was and they were quite friendly. The only time I encountered a guard was when we went exploring in the rooftop garden. He was at the door and stared us down before asking if we were guests. I simply said ""yes"" and he smiled, opened the door and said ""right this way, sir"". People tell me I generally looked pissed off all the time, so maybe security assumes I'm a serious gambler and not just another drunk college kid. 

That being said, I don't like the casino overall. Architecturally, the place and rooms are beautiful. The games are fair priced (found 10 dollar tables everywhere at night). The free drinks were large and delicious, but didn't come around too often (typical AC). The waitresses were drop dead gorgeous, the dancers were not. The slot games were entertaining. The restaurants and bars were incredibly overpriced. A Captain and Coke was 14 dollars at the whiskey bar. At one restaurant, a burger was $26 and served a la mode.  

Despite the people in my company of 5 having a combined annual income of over $300K, we felt poor. There is no value to what you get there. The place is marketed as a ""resort"" but with little to do. You want to go to a spa?  Better shell out $300 minimum.  You want to go to the pool?  Good luck finding 2 square feet to stand in. Feel like ice cream?  Too fucking bad.  How about an affordable bar with fun things to do like pool and ping pong?  How dare you cheapen the atmosphere??!!

Look, what AC needs is to cater to respectable middle class working people, which NJ still has a lot of despite the economy.  You want to bring in income?  Give me something for my value. I always tell people I'd gladly spend a couple hundred dollars a night if I knew I was guarenteed a good time.  This includes plenty of delicious food, tons of drinks (don't know the last time I got drunk in AC for less than 100 bucks), affordable rooms on weekends (less than 300), a fun bar (a la Hooks in Seaside), free parking, and a more youthful atmosphere. All my coworkers agree with me.  AC also needs stuff for kids.  How about some fields for sports activities run by each casino?  Parents can gamble, the kids can play baseball, kickball, soccer, tennis, etc.  Get some clowns and make balloon animals for the kids, then get then some free ice cream.  Have a music and science museum where they can learn instruments and play with interactive experiments like the Ben Franklin Museum or Liberty Science center. Think of how a cruise ship caters to kids and tranfer that mentalility to Atlantic City.  

Either these casinos have no imagination or have the worst financial planners and visionaries in existence. Let me loose in their designing and planning phase and you would have a god damn Utopia. While we are at it, address the slums nearby with affordable decent housing and a more hands on approach to community involvement.

"c4xj77s","There are varying schools of thought on what to eat/not eat if you are trying to rid the body of yeast overgrowth.  Some people have to cut out all grains for awhile, some people find vinegar helps, others find it hurts, some use yogurt, others don't.

The simplest diet is fish and veggies.  But that's pretty plain and hard to stick to.  I would suggest she try to avoid all breads and other flour-based products for a few weeks just to give her system a rest.  


Some of your specific questions...

Milk:  for now she may have to just go without.  Milk substitutes are usually made from refined grains and often have added sugars.  

Yogurt:  anti-candida diets sometimes suggest using yogurt to restore ""good bacteria"" to the gut.  But most commercial yogurt is simply too clean to include much bacteria - better to take a capsule with acidophilus or lacto-bacilus bacteria - at least until she's feeling better.  In a couple months she could try a bit of unsweetened yogurt and assess how **she** reacts (every body is different).

Bread:  there are yeast-free breads, but for now she is best to avoid all bread.  Have you ever made bread?  You start by giving the yeast something to grow on; usually flour and warm water and maybe a bit of sugar.  So think of avoiding those same conditions in your body.  Even yeast free bread has flour to grow yeast on.

Olive oil:  is safe to cook with at low temperatures (brush some on some veggies and roast them at a low temp for something yummy.  Use it as a salad dressing.  But olive oil is not good for frying.  There are oils for frying; I like grape-seed, but look for ""cold-pressed"" and ""unrefined"" to avoid processed oils.  
**Also: Flax oil.  This is available at health food stores and has to be refrigerated and is NOT for cooking.  It is slightly bitter and a bit of an acquired taste but I can not recommend it highly enough for good digestion.  I feel worlds better with lots of flax oil in my diet - I pour it (a tablespoon or two at a time) over plain rice and veggies with a bit of sea-salt - yum!

Dark Green leafy veggies:  pretty self-explanatory.  Go to the produce section - look for green leaves buy them eat them :).  Kale is a good start,  spinach,  collard greens, dandelion leaves, rapini (like broccoli but more leaf than flower - kinda bitter - my favourite), arugula aka ""rocket"" (looks a bit like spinach/lettuce, is a bit spicy).  If you have an ""ethnic"" grocery store in your town check it out for other leafy greens you may not have seen before.

Uncured pork: just mean fresh - like pork chops or tenderloin, not bacon or sausage.

Whole grain/whole wheat:  whole grain means any grain (oats, rice, barley, quinoa, millet, etc) that is left intact or ground whole into flour. Often grains are processed to remove the ""bran""- the outer husk which includes much of the fiber - these are not whole grains.  Whole grain can include wheat, but I suspect your wife may do well to avoid wheat for a while, so I suggest you seek out other whole grains for now.  I would guess that by ""whole grain"" your doctor meant for you to eat the grain whole (like we do with rice) rather than ground into four (""whole wheat"" bread uses the whole grain for the flour, but it is still ground).

Nuts:  unprocessed means raw - these must be refrigerated to avoid going rancid and are available in health food stores, but not often in grocery stores.  Nuts that are ""roasted"" (even ""dry roasted"") or ""salted"" have been processed and should be avoided.  Check with your doctor to be sure, but I think you're probably safe to buy raw nuts and seeds and roast them yourself if you eat them immediately.

Vegetable oils: I suspect here your doctor means things like flax oil.  Again - get in the habit of eating flax oil!

As for cooking, head to the library and get some cook books geared towards simpler, healthier cooking.  It is going to be tough at first to get used to a restricted diet.  Not only are you cutting you some yummy ingredients, you're cutting out a lot of the convenience foods it is very easy to rely on.  (For me toast with something on it is my go-to snack, giving it up requires creativity.)  Figure out a couple quick snacks that you like which fit your criteria and be sure to keep well stocked with those foods so that you don't derail your diet when you're tired or rushed.

A lot of our modern diets emphasize excitement.  We expect constantly to have interesting and complex flavours and the simplicity of basic food gets lost under sauces or heavy spicing.  It will take **patience** to get used to this new way of cooking.  But eventually your body will re-learn to enjoy the flavour of food for its own sake.  Be sure to buy the freshest possible ingredients - crappy food tastes fine with heavy sauces, but only fresh food tastes good plain.

Are you in place with a variety of food shopping options?  I've already suggested ""ethnic"" food stores, but also recommend farmer's markets.  This is a good way to find the freshest foods in your area and to learn about new veggies you might not have tried.  You can also ask farmers and other customers for their recipes (keeping in mind that you may not be able to use many of the ingredients).

Beware of raw food recommendations.  People often assume raw veggies are health foods but raw foods are not necessarily well absorbed by our bodies; human beings have evolved to eat cooked foods for thousands of years.  I often urge people to be sure the food the **buy** is raw - and then to cook it themselves.  Lightly steamed veggies are still colourful and delicious, but just a little easier on the body.

A final suggestion.  Buy a rice cooker.  I use mine to cook any grain (you may need to change the ratio of water:grain depending on which you're cooking).  It is a huge convenience and makes cooking rice (or quinoa or millet, etc) just as easy as toasting bread (though it'll take a bit longer).  I often chop veggies while the rice is cooking and throw them on top of the rice a few minutes before it finishes for an easy one-pot meal (you do have to be quick if you do this or you mess up the water:grain ratio by letting out the steam and your rice ends up too hard).  If you include an onion or some garlic in the veggie mix it's not too bland.

Good luck with this lifestyle change.  It is hard at first and takes some will power.  Also please be aware that your wife may feel worse before she feels better - as the yeast overgrowth ""dies off"" it can wreck havoc.  This is normal and may be helped by ""activated charcoal"" capsules (find 'em at the pharmacy).  But from my own experience I would say your wife can and will feel heaps better soon enough.

Hope this helps.

Edit:  don't be afraid to buy frozen veggies (so long as they're plain, not mixed with sauces).  In the summer it's great to have fresh veggies, but if those are hard to find in your area, or if you're busy; frozen veggies are usually picked at the peak of their ripeness and frozen quickly for maximum flavour.

"c4k3o0y","If you are more familiar with Speyside scotch (Livet, Fiddich), I would advise against making the switch to Islay for a special bottle. The difference can be dramatic (i.e Oban or Lagavulin) and it would be a shame to spend $100 on a bottle you are not sure you will enjoy. Islat scotches can be fantastic. I highly recommend to try them sometime, but I'd advise trying them at a bar first, before committing to buying a nice bottle for special occasion. 

Having said that, I will echo what many others have already said regarding Speyside scotches. 

My personal favorite is a tie between the Glelivet 15 and the Balvenie single barrel. They are similar, except the Balvenie packs more intensity, compared to the buttery smoothness of the livet. The livet, honestly, is almost too easy to drink, but its delicious. The balvenie on the other hand is a bit more powerful, making you appreciate it a little more. 
Top recommendation Balvenie  - either doublewood or Single barrel. 

Other recommendations that match your taste are: 

Glenmorangie  - all sweet and delicious, but perhaps try the Lasanta or Quinta Ruban if you are looking for something sweet and different. they are matured in sherry &amp; port (respectively) casks giving them a uniquely sweet and delicious taste. 

Balvenie 14yr rum cask - similar to the above, this scotch has an interesting hint of rum flavor in it. It is still undeniably a bold scotch, but it offers just a little something sweet and different. 

Dalwhinnie 15yr - this is called ""the gentle spirit"" and it certainly lives up to its name. Tastes of toffee and honey with just the very slightest hint of peat in the background. Very similar to what you have tried, but smoother, lighter, and that peat will offer a slightly different flavor profile without knocking you on your ass (as the lagavulin surely would...) 

Yamazaki 12 - This doesn't really bring anything different, per se, compared to the above suggestions, but it is delicious. Easily competitive with the Balvenies and Glenlivets, its just another delicious scotch of the same ilk that is worth trying. 

Macallan - If you have never tried Macallan you owe it to yourself to do so. It should be higher on my list but I only just thought of it. Absolutely top notch and totally unique in flavor. overpriced (IMHO), but delicious. It also suits your flavor profile but definitely provides a different delicious flavor compared to the Livets, Fiddichs &amp; Walkers.

**Ingredients**

* 2 large cans apple pie filling
* 1 box graham crackers
* 1/3 cup sugar
* 3 sticks of butter
* 1 box white cake mix (with sugar included)
* 9x13 inch pan

*  Dump cans of apple pie filling into pan and level out
*  Open cake mix and dump over top of apple pie filling making sure to level it out in an equal thickness
*  2 sticks of butter into pads about 1/4 inch thick and place atop over cake mixture.  Basically the butter is going to melt and cook the top to a nice even brown so don't skimp
*  Toss in oven at 350 degrees for 25 minutes or until top is golden brown and crispy

"c2m7i6b","People that don't drink seem to not realize how much there is between sober and wasted. I really like beer and wine and they compliment food in ways that sweet beverages will never be able to match. Now that I'm older, I typically don't drink unless there is also food involved. 

Unless we're talking about over-priced completely ridiculous cocktails. Now, I'm sure there are a lot of virgin ""mocktails"" that are also fun and delicious, but in a good cocktail, the alcohol will add important flavors to the drink, a sort of biterness and depth that you won't get with club soda mixed with fruit/herbs. There's a bar in San Francisco called Lion Pub and they make cocktails out of fresh fruit and they're amazing. My favorite is a blackberry lemondrop. Do you really need to ask why someone might drink that?

And then there are alcohols that I feel are an interested cultural experience. Bourbon/Whiskey/Scotch tasting. Vodka at Russian weddings/parties/any event, really. Tequila is also a really interesting drink once you move up from Jose Cuervo.

The problem is you're probably seeing a lot of shitty cheap keg beer and jack and cokes or screwdrivers with WAY too much alcohol in them and you're wondering what the fuck people are thinking. Those are bad drinks. That is not alcohol that is worth drinking. Beer and wine are an acquired taste, so don't be surprised if you don't like them at first (at about 25, I suddenly started liking beer and wine). Try something friendly and nice. Like Sangria! Or Mojitos! Or some fruity cocktail like a lychee martini.

By cutting out all alcohol, you're refusing a HUGE part of the food and beverage world. That's like saying, ""I refuse to eat Chinese food"" or ""I won't eat anything with an onion in it."" It's just silly. 

If you're worried about getting drunk and losing control, you can probably have one drink without throwing up everywhere and taking nude photos.

"c2iorle","Sure :) 

**Breakfast (if I feel like eating it):**

* 1 egg and 3-4 slices of bacon cooked in coconut oil
* OR an omelette using 2 eggs, a dollop of heavy whipping cream and whatever I have on hand (some gravlox, cream cheese, and avocado for instance).
* OR frozen turkey sausage that I found at a local co-op with an excellent fat content.
* Black or green tea with heavy cream on most days (sometimes an americano with heavy cream)

The one-minute muffins look good and I intend to try those as an easy breakfast when I procure some flax meal :)

Before breakfast, I take Acetyl-L-Carnitine (500mg) as a supplement as well. It seems to have helped me with fat loss and provides extra energy. The weight loss factor may not be due to the ALC at all, but it seems steadier since I started taking it, and I've read that it can be useful in a HFLC diet. I also supplement with a multivitamin, calcium, vitamin D, and fish oil.

**Lunch**

As It's summer and I've been waking up rather late (and staying at home), I often have a few snacks and it's enough to sustain me until dinner (string cheese, a handful of almonds). I still haven't gotten the hang of lunch on this diet, and I'll have to figure out a new tactic for portable keto foods once I start classes again in a couple weeks. 

* Often I'll heat up leftovers from last night's dinner
* Maybe once every 2 weeks I'll have a stove-top pizza made on a whole-wheat tortilla with a small amount of tomato sauce, mozzarella sauce, and whatever toppings I have (generally pepperoni).
* Very rarely a bunless burger with cheese and bacon
* Salad (I'm not a huge fan of ranch or vinegar, though, and dry lettuce is not too appetizing... so I don't eat much salad).

**Dinner**

We discovered a butcher near our house and are loving it... cheap, delicious meat!

* Marbled rib-eye steaks 
* Veal patties with a chicken broth, lemon, white wine, butter thyme sauce, a modification on [this](http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/Veal-Cutlets-with-Thyme-Butter-Sauce-234142) recipe.
* Curry chicken with cauliflower rice. We use [this](http://www.sukhis.com/products/home-chef/tikka-masala-curry-paste.php) brand of curry paste and add chicken breast and heavy whipping cream. There are many other pastes made by the same company, as you can see. We've tried the Vindaloo as well, and it's also good.
* Chicken thighs with skin-on, baked with a little soy sauce, poultry seasoning, and garlic
* Ribs on occasion; no BBQ sauce for me (my boyfriend found a low-carb BBQ sauce that he enjoys called Stubb's).
* Prime rib from a nearby deli when we're lazy.
* Baked Salmon
* Sometimes we'll have breakfast for dinner, devouring these delicious [bacon and egg muffins](http://www.primalchefs.com/2011/08/primal-cheesy-bacon-and-egg-muffins/).
* We also add veggies to our dinners. We tend toward asparagus or broccoli. We also have artichokes about once a week, as they're delicious but expensive. Asparagus cooked on the stovetop with alfredo, extra parmesan, paprika, pepper, lemon, and white wine is quite yummy. You can also broil most veggies with some salt, pepper, and garlic and they turn out great. [This](http://www.amateurgourmet.com/2008/11/the_best_brocco.html) is also an easy, yummy broccoli recipe.

**Snacks**

* Tamari almonds
* String cheese or other type of cheese (colby jack, dubliner, etc.) in moderation
* Dark chocolate (a couple very small squares most days). I'm addicted to [this](http://www.nirvanachocolates.com/ourshop/organic/index.asp) brand, especially the blueberry acai bar. It's expensive, but so so good. One bar lasts me a week :)
* Celery and peanut butter in moderation 
* Roasted peanuts in moderation


I try not to snack too much throughout the day, as many of my snacks can add up in terms of carbs. I drink almost exclusively water, but enjoy tea or coffee in the morning.

"c2eod96","These recipies all seem to be moving around the same central theme, and all sound delicious, but here's my two cents.

You want to get two (or even three, if you've got a big family) cans of beans in tomato sauce with pork. None of that molassas crap - we'll be adding our own sugars. I like to call the lump of pork fat the ""Queen Bean.""

Mix in a generous squirt of equal parts ketchup - and here's the important part - yellow mustard. I hate yellow mustard, but keep a jar *just for these beans*. The amount I use is never measured, but lets say about three tablespoons of each, if you're one of those ""I need science for cooking"" kind of people.

Next up, Worchestershire sauce. Maybe three of four dashes from the bottle. I like Lee &amp; Perkins, but really, whatever brand will work fine. 

Depending on what you have available, you'll need a bit more sugar; the ketchup alone won't quite cover the sweetness we want. A tablespoon of brown sugar should do the trick, but as others have mentioned, maple syrup works very well. It has to be real maple syrup, though, and the darker the better. I suppose if you had some maple sugar, you could just use that instead, but I've never tried it. Also, who keeps maple sugar and can resist eating it?

Now here's the fun part - you want all those flavours to pop. That's why you add the hot sauce. You do not want to make spicy beans (or maybe you do?) so don't add too much - we're going for accentuating flavour here. A relatively mild sauce will work - Frank's Red Hot, for example - maybe four or five shakes from the bottle. If you don't usually carry hot sauce in your home, what the heck is wrong with you? Also, you can use a few shakes of white vinegar, a heafty pinch of cayan pepper and a small pintch of garlic powder, as that is essentially all Frank's Red Hot is anyway.

Mix all that together, and if you want extra pork, cut up two or three bacon strips and sprinkle on top of the beans. Maple smoked bacons works well, especially if you're going with the maple theme.

The great things about beans is that when you get them in a can, they are pre-cooked. this means there is no particular ""right way"" to actually bake them. fire 'em in at about 350 for 30 minutes or so is a good guideline. If they look too runny, put 'em in for longer. I like to just slightly overcook my beans so they get sticky and delicious. Different strokes for different folks, however, so cook them to your desired level. If you're baking a roast or something, the beans will cook fine at a lower temperature (even argueably taking on a more complex flavour), you'll just need to leave them in longer for them to reach their appropriate done-itude.

These beans go especially well with (garlic) mashed potatos and any sort of beef, but are so tasty that they work pretty much always. *HOT BEANS!* are an oft requested dish at pot lucks where I come from.

One last thing: beans are one of those things that it is hard to mess up. We all have our little quirks when cooking them (as you can see from reading all these posts!) Once you feel comfortable and no longer call yourself a bean beginner, the thing to do is play with these recipies a bit, adjust to your own style and make what your family enjoys the most.

"c29anzn","I have two go-to chicken recipes, both are easy as can be - I usually bake them but you could cook these however you want:

**Honey-Soy Chicken:** Get some good soy-sauce, about a cup or so. Mix in a couple of tablespoons of honey, adding more or less depending on your sweet tooth. Brush over the chicken a couple of hours before cooking, and again a few times during the first three-quasrters of the cooking process (you want to leave them alone in the last cooking stage so the skin crisps up nicely). You can add a little chinese five-spice to this if you want a more oriental flavour.

**Peanut-butter Satay:** This one's amazingly delicious, but less healthy! Get about a cup of peanut butter (I prefer crunchy, but whatever you have to hand/prefer - if you want to make it less fatty use 3/4 cup PB and add 1/4 - 1/2 cup of Greek Yoghurt - it also makes it a touch less sweet). In a small bowl, add soy sauce and mix until you get a soft paste (I can't really give measurements here because it depends on your PB, and whether you added yoghurt or not). To the mixture add pepper (to taste), about 1/2 teaspoon of cumin and 1/2 teaspoon of chicken stock powder.

"c26y4uw","If basic beer flavor offends, what may help is starting out in overlapping territory. So for example, if you like fruit juice, try some fruit lambics or other fruit beers. You can often find [Lindemans lambics](http://i.imgur.com/qsMLR.jpg) in finer liquor stores with good/fancy import sections. That allows you to taste something that's familiar and delicious layered over a beer taste. That can help you get used to beer taste.

Then if you like that, you can move closer to beer flavor and further from fruit. [Magic Hat #9](http://www.magichat.net/elixirs/9) is just slightly fruity. It's a pale ale and has a hint of apricot in it. It's delicious, but much more beery than a really sweet lambic.

Or you can try a hefeweizen or wheat beer or witbier with a slice of fruit squeezed in it. Hoegaarden is often served with a lemon wedge in bars. It's really nice in the summer. Blue Moon is often served with an orange round in bars. It's a way to ease into a nice light-drinking beer.

You can also try sweet brown ales and sweet stouts to start you off in safer territory, flavorwise.

Samuel Smith's Nut Brown Ale, for example, is so goddamn delicious. Malty, slightly sweet, buttery, maybe a hint of caramel. You could just stop right there if you wanted to because it's so great. Newcastle is a brown ale you may have heard of and which is readily available, but in my opinion it doesn't have a lot of flavor. But that may actually be perfect for you to ease yourself in. Some browns are malty and sweeter and some crank up the hops and almost have some coffee going on. 

As for stouts, forget Guinness if you've had that. Guinness is its own animal and is what most people think of when they think of stout. Nothing else tastes quite like it in my opinion. It has its place, but there are loads of other stouts out there and if you're not put off by them, you have a lot to try. Me, I kind of have to be in the mood. But Samuel Smith's comes through again with their Oatmeal Stout and their Imperial Stout. Both are superb. It's a fun category to explore. Dark, thick, and loads of flavor. Stouts often have chocolate/cocoa/mocha taste notes going on. Porter is stout's cousin, maybe halfway between regular ale and stout. I've had many that lean towards coffee and lack the sweetness of many stouts.

One thing to be careful of early on is hops. It's the traditional flavoring of beer but the American microbrew scene has gone insane with hops. Sooo many pale ales and India pale ales (IPAs) as well as other things with hops cranked up. There are different kinds, so depending on which kinds a beer uses and at what levels, you can get something that's just nuclear and tastes like a pungent bowling shoe or something that's just woken up a bit from a bland and mild base or something fruityish or floral or all of those things at once. Some people are hopheads and others aren't fans. Just be aware that when you hear IPA, get ready.

"c22j53g","Don't put too much weight on the citizenship process. It's a progression of ever expanding work- and residence permits (company, sector, then full and permanent, I believe after four years), with increasing access to the social nets, that culminates in citizenship eventually. Unless you both end up unemployed for too long, or move out of the country for an extended period, you'll be eligible for citizenship after eight years, seven if you speak basic German and take an integration course.

Really, the most important question is, where do you *want* to live? I'd give economic stability some consideration, but most European countries are doing fine. Forget the bureaucratic aspects of citizenship/visas (as long as you normally end up with citizenship eventually, which you will pretty much anywhere in Europe). This won't be of any significance in your everyday life, but almost all other aspects will. Once you've found a job and have settled in, you'll spend more time worrying about shitty weather than about those things.

&gt; Food Stamps. Obviously a database will be employed, but what is the cost of implementing this versus the ""savings"" (whatever that means in this contest) to the taxpayers? 

Databases are incredibly cheap especially when we compress. The government simply makes a list of categories for the grocery stores to know what items can be bought with food stamps. If fraud is expected simply pull up the store's ID and look at their transcripts (various ways of doing this such as calculating the sums and averages in nearby grocery stores while calculating population inflation rate). Obviously this isn't 100%, nothing top-to-bottom down is, which is why all big governments WILL fail. It's not an IF, or a ""This time is different!"" big governments will always fail until technology can make the world as small as possible (teleportations, etc).

&gt; We've seen the push back from removing soda from vending machines in schools. If you think it won't be a circus of lobbyists claiming that gnutella is healthy and wholesome, you are naive.

I think gnutella is just as bad, I'm not as dumb as you remember? In my old high school they replaced soda with york milk bottles (delicious but atrocious for your health). This is a perfect example as to why governments do not work. They are well intentioned but never execute properly (see: Social Security, war on drugs, war on poverty and war on education).

&gt; We have a board of education that hands out money to schools with high pass rates and you think the administration is happy when a teacher fails a student

OK, you obviously do not have ANY clue on what ""Pass"" and ""Fail"" means for the US government department of education. In order for a school to be considered passing it must get a 100% on the standardized tests (my mom's local elementary school is currently trying to fight this with the county right now). Some states I believe it's in the 90ish range, but still you need to get an A to pass or you fail. Not really a good system right? It just seems like it because every kid does pass (no child left behind). 

Again, your story only illustrates the fact that public schools are, by no stretch of the imagination, efficient. You will be guaranteed that any private school would NOT do that (or the teacher would be fired or they could lose their accreditation from either the government or a 3rd party recognized name). 

&gt; There is a gigantic culture shift that has to happen to make this a reality.

Yup, it really is a tragedy that everyone gets a gold star. Don't be fooled though, this is exactly where the rich want us. If everyone gets a gold star you no longer have the incentive to put fourth any effort into anything. 

&gt; Again, my point is that what appear to be simple problems, are not necessarily simple.

They're incredibly simple, stop mingling the government with the market (e.g. corporations is a *socialists* concept not a capitalist concept) especially on a local level and let the businesses establish themselves. Will you have frauds and scams? Absolutely, you already have this even with the government (and even with investing a lot of money into certain programs *ahems* BP oil spill).

1) The coffee get cold FAST.  If we're not really on the ball and slurping down our coffee at high speeds, some of it is too cold and goes to waste every time.

2) If you drink a lot of coffee, or if you are making for multiple people, you will go through a LOT of beans.  It can get expensive.

3) It takes a little longer and is a little more work than a regular coffee maker.  You have to actually mange it and do stuff, rather then just filling it and doing other things until the coffee is ready.

4)The coffee is STRONG and delicious, but if you grind it incorrectly there will be coffee grounds in the bottom of your cup.  It can be way too strong for some folks.

"c177ecr","Let's start at the beginning.  How do you cook the rice and the beans? We fix a big pot full of rice and beans (okay, it's actually two pots) every week or two and this is how we do it.  

First the rice.  You can add a lot of flavor to the rice by cooking it with stock.  It's easy to make your own stock.  Throw a big onion (quartered), some celery, some carrots, and some rosemary (or other herbs you like) in a pot of water and let it simmer for a few hours.  If you eat meat you can throw in a soup bone or some leftover chicken bones. Then mix this stock half and half with water when you boil your rice.  When we cook rice Mexican style we also toss some oil in the pan and fry up some onions first then fry the rice a bit before adding the liquids. It's subtle, but I think it adds a bit more depth to the flavor of the rice. 

For the beans, start by soaking them in plain water for at least 8 hours before boiling.  And change the soak water every couple of hours.  The more changes the better.  You do this because it dissolves and removes the indigestible sugars that cause gas.  And no matter how good beans are for your heart, this makes you easier to be around. When you are ready to boil the beans, cut up an onion and some garlic and throw that in the water too.  If you can get [epazote](http://mexicanfood.about.com/od/spanishterms/g/Epazote.htm) throw some of that in there.  It really adds something to the flavor.  I like a half and half mix of black beans and pinto beans.  My wife likes to add garbanzos, but I think they ruin the flavor.  We then throw the beans and onions with some of the water in a blender and make [frijoles refritos](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refried_beans).  If you can get [Mexican oregano](http://www.chipotlepowder.com/mexican-oregano) throw some of that in too.  It adds a lot of flavor. And lastly you need to add salt when frying the beans.  Enough salt really makes the difference between disgusting and delicious. 

Okay, now you have great tasting beans and rice.  You can eat them plain.  They really are delicious.  But I usually like a hot sauce to spice them up a bit.  I just ran out so I made a new one today.  I started with about a quarter cup of home grown, dried, crushed cayenne peppers.  I added a few cloves of garlic, a couple chipotle peppers a friend gave me, some salt, and covered it all with vinegar.  Then I put that in the blender and let it blend for a while.  It really kicks it up a notch.  It's a lot cheaper and, in my opinion, better to make your own salsa, but you can use Siracha or whatever you have.  You can also put some cheddar cheese on top of your beans.  That's always nice.  

Good luck and bon appetit.

Edit: By the way, did you know that you can screw the blades and collar from a standard sized blender (like an [Oster](http://www.amazon.com/Oster-4093-Classic-Beehive-Blender/dp/B00005QFKG)) onto a mason jar or other standard threaded salsa jar or spaghetti sauce jar?

"c14kqwi","Balance the perspectives you'll hear about the French Quarter and Bourbon Street. Yes, it's very touristy. Yes, it's also awesome. Don't spend all of your time there, but do appreciate the energy of the area. I've heard great things about Drago's.

The French Quarter is next to the **Marigny** - known for its jazz scene. Go to one or more: d.b.a., The Spotted Cat, Snug Harbor. All of these venues are on Frenchman Street, which is less crazy than the Quarter but still very popular. Basically any place on Frenchman has great music any night of the week.

The best jazz scene I found, however, is **Vaughan's Lounge** in the Bywater. The Bywater is a district in the Ninth Ward (across the river from the Lower Ninth Ward, which is where you'd have seen the post-Katrina destruction images from). It's not a rich neighborhood. It is safe but be smart (Don't wave around your video camera, walk down dark alleys, etc). Go to Vaughan's on Thursday night, when local jazz legend Kermit Ruffins has a weekly gig. He might barbecue for you, too. Sometimes the food is free. Take a cab there and back.

Go to the **Backstreet Cultural Museum** in Treme. This $8 ticket is a fascinating look into the world of Mardi Gras Indians and Social Aid and Pleasure Clubs narrated in person by someone deeply involved in the culture. Like learning the philosophy behind the Quarter's craziness. You can walk there from your lodging during the day. It's right by Louis Armstrong Park, which will probably be closed. The museum is in the first two rooms of a house on a residential street. Don't be shy; go on in. If you're late, he'll just start the tour again and you can pay/leave when he starts repeating stuff.

**Uptown** is a different experience. Somewhat touristy but more upper class and heavy student populations (Tulane and Loyola Universities are right there). Walk around Magazine Street, enjoy window shopping and relax at a coffee shop for a bit if you feel like it. Eat at Casamento's - oysters, mmm.

Walk to **Canal and St. Charles** from your lodging and pay $1.25 to take the streetcar up to Carrollton. Beautiful houses and parks line either side of the ride, and you'll see both universities on the way up. **Carrollton** is kind of like Uptown. Popular food destinations: Jaques Imo's (fun cajun place), Dante's (delicious but expensive). Maple Leaf Bar here is great - there's a repeating Wednesday gig by the Rebirth Brass Band. Recommended.

**I don't recommend:**

* Frank's - in the French Quarter. They seem to have some history that keeps people going, but I don't like their food/service.
* WW2 Museum - I found it uncomfortably propagandaist. If you do go, at the very least don't see the ""4D"" movie.
* Cafe Du Monde - Hugely famous 24/hr coffee/pastry shop.

"c0u4sqi","It was the sound of metal on metal, the kind you hear when you fix your plumbing with a wrench. When I woke up it echoed in my ears, but I gave it no second thought, rejoiced instead by the lack of cacophony that my alarm clock usually makes. Sideline: through years of and  delicious but shallow sleep-snooze cycles (delicious in the same way it is tasty to lick a jar jelly from the outside), my synapses have been rewired to force me to hit the snooze button and then prepare me for another 7 minute period of sleep. Indeed whenever I hear that shrill sound in my waking life, I get angry and sleepy at the same time.

So the noise that woke me was not the beep I've grown to loathe, but the cringe of metal, as if it were breathing. As I readied myself to get back to sleep, I reached for the glass of water I always keep on my bedside table. It was the funniest of feelings. There was not bedside table. I opened my eyes, but the room was very dark, the only source of light coming from around the frame of the door.

Where am I? Feelings of confusion. A pang of fear, then calming thoughts of reason. It can't be that bad, right nothing crazy happened last night. Indeed, you are probably in the home of some girl you gut lucky with last night. That's not reason, that's wishful thinking. Think.

Process of elimination. Where the fuck am I?

I am eliminating each obvious contender as they come to me. Homes of friends current and past. Hotel rooms. (Why is there no bedside table?) I'm sweating now.

Is there anyone in bed with me? I want to turn around but my body seems paralyzed. Get your shit together, man. I roll over, falling off the other side of the bed. Single. The wall is also way too close. That pang of fear returns, this time escalating. Where the fuck am I? 

The panic starts in my stomach. The nausea lasts only for a fraction of a second, the snake inside me moves up towards my chest. My heart is racing and I am panting. The clown in me tries to break the tension. See, it's like a retarded internet meme: Do not want! Yeah, hehe, this is definitely a case of ""do not want"". See I know everything will be fine, it's just that my legs will not respond to the commands I issue them. Even though I'm lying down, I know my knee is made of jelly.

I sit up. The metal breathes again in a loud cringing noise. I think it's echoing. I've heard this sound before. Where was it? TV, video game? Shudder. A thousand needles of frost bite my body at the same time. I feel the adrenalin course through my veins, like a drunkard feels the spirit flow through him right before he throws up.

Time to move. I say ""Hello?"", it come out barely above a whisper, like a child asking for forgiveness just before the punishment is administered. Let's try that again: ""Hello?!"", louder this time, but still not my voice. I'm off the bed now, in the tiny room, I'm looking for my clothes. They're there, but everything else is gone. My phone. FUCK, my phone! My watch. Lucky I wasn't wearing a ni Wallet. FUCK, now phone, no wallet, no shoes. Ah my glasses. Why?

Why?

I open the door and in the same motion, trip over something. CLANK! The door is made of metal, my head says. Why is the doorstop so high? The light is very artificial, it has a yellowish hue, as if the filament were just pissing it out. The corridor is really narrow, but long. Metal. Everything's made of metal. Steel horizontal bar on both sides.

Am I on a-? Get the fuck out of here, I've never been on a submarine before, what would I be doing there? There is a rumble. Everything's shaken. I reflexively grip the bar on the side. Just hold on. Grip tightly and everything will be ok. Don't let go. The boat's trembling. I will not let go of the handlebar, I don't want to see how much my hand is trembling.

It's like a scream. Not in the sharp way a dog barks, but in the frightening way someone moans when all of their appendages have been cut off. The metal is moaning and it scares the shit out of me. My throat closes, and I get really dizzy. My teeth are chattering. And it's fucking cold. Cold, man. What the FUCK is going on?

The floor is wet. Did I just piss myself? On an instinct, I look up. There is a crashing noise. My ears pop. I know I am going to die. Fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck I'm about to die, no not yet no please no, PLEASE! A part of is trying to find a way out this hell. A part of me is trying to remember this life that is apparently about to be over. A part of me just wants to cry. I do neither. I just close my eyes and brace for impact. 

The water hits me straight in the stomach the same way my older brother always did. It knocks my breath right out. I try to reach up, but the corridor's already filled up. I try to swim away, but I'm pinned to the door by force so mighty it has to be mother nature itself. The door has a wheel, I try to reach, I can't, oh come ON motherfucker, fine it's there, now turn, no, turn, please, turn, dammit, TURN!

The water is salty and it burns my lounge like ever has or ever will. There is a sharp sound I can hear through the water. The walls of the ship are expanding, it's beeping away louder and louder more and more clearly, holy shit will the boat blow up before I drown? The pressure alarm is so familiar from somewhere. Those are my last thoughts before I drown.

"c0pfnsu","I am vegetarian, but I have to say, eating vegetarian fare will not necessarily make you healthier. While you can be a very healthy vegetarian, it is much harder than being a very healthy omnivore. For example, protein is absolutely essential in diet, and it is MUCH harder to acquire enough when you are a vegetarian (speaking from experience!) Instead, you may want to just cut down on eating red meat. Turkey, chicken, fish and leaner meats are amazing sources of protein with much much lower fat content than say beef. 

Also, cooking at home is an amazing way to lose weight. When you cook at home you can really see what you are putting into your food, where in restaurants, that spinach might look healthy and taste delicious, but it is probably drenched in butter. Tip: olive oil. I seriously swear by it. You don't need much but it somehow makes everything taste savory and delicious without all the saturated fat. Stir frys are god sends. Easy, cheap, and delicious.

And don't try to cut out everything delicious! You'll just end up breaking your rules on a binge end feel like shit. Instead maybe eat something small a day... I usually have three spoons full of ice cream a day to get my fix of sweet or a piece of chocolate.

"c0ouvex","This is insanely delicious - I call it the ramelete.

You'll need 3 eggs, a pack of ramen (I personally prefer chili flavor here), a wok and/or skillet (two if you're not comfortable with flipping top-chef-style), non-olive cooking oil, and whatever seasoning you can come up with. I personally like adding a bit of shredded pickled ginger, sriacha sauce, chopped ham, crushed garlic, and chopped green peppers.

* In a large bowl, thoroughly whisk the 3 eggs with the flavor powder and any other sauce/spices/seasoning.
* In a pan, boil crushed ramen noodles to your desired lack of crunchyness.
* In the skillet, heat up your oil of choice. Make sure to use a good amount, as this WILL stick. Anything besides Olive oil will do; I personally prefer peanut oil. If you have vegetables and/or meat, chop them up and sautee them 75% of the way to perfection in the oil before adding the eggy concoction later.
* Drain the ramen bits and mix with the egg solution. Pour this into the hot oil, and don't stir - instead, after a thirty seconds or so, GENTLY wedge a spatula underneath every so often to make sure it's not sticking.
* Once the eggs appear to be 2/3rds cooked, flip the omelet. This is the trickiest part; what I do is have a second heated/oiled pan ready to go to simply drop the omelet into rather than attempt to make the thing do a backflip.

"c0opbkp","You're asking the wrong question. You don't want to be avoiding fat.  You want to be eating meat and pursuing flavor.

Eating more meat, vegetables and fruit and fewer grains will improve your diet. If you want to eat more eat, eat meat that is tasty. 

For breakfast, I recommend bacon, eggs and cheese. I usually enjoy that with sliced up green apples for texture and flavor. Sunny side up is delicious, but if you're trying to cut back on bread, fry your eggs over easy. That way you still get the deliciousness of the yolk without having to use a delicious brioche for a cleanup job. Real talk.

When making burgers, go for chuck with the highest fat content available. Most gourmet burgers use a chuck/brisket hybrid that has 30% fat content. 20% or more will suffice.

Organ meats are a delicious and inexpensive treat. Chicken livers cost $1.50/pound, are full of vitamins and iron, and taste delicious saut√©ed with onions, peas, bacon and garlic. They spoil rather quickly, however, so cook them up the day you buy them.

Don't be afraid of tougher cuts of meat. If you enjoy Osso Bucco, but don't want to shell out the big bucks, veal shoulder is your friend and can be got for $2/pound. Prepare it the same way as you would prepare Osso Bucco, braised in a good broth, with carrots, onions, and whatever other vegetables you enjoy.

The meat you eat is NOT nutritious, if it is corn fed beef.  Being corn fed makes it MORE delicious, but less nutritious, so people do not eat meat because it is nutritious, we eat it because for hundreds of thousands of years it WAS nutritious, so we evolved a desire for it.  Those who desired more meat were more likely to survive a long winter than those who ate carrots or greens and disliked meat.  See what I mean?  Those people's genes were weeded out, meat eaters survived.  But that meat was really nutritious, todays meat is not, but we like it even more than we like 'real' meat because our evolved tastes make us crave the fat, and corn fed beef has more fat in it.  Not that the fat is what is bad, it is bad because the corn makes the cow unhealth, unlike if it was eating greens.

We eat because things are delicious.  We find things delicious because we evolved desires for things that were healthy for us (salt, fat, sweets/calories) but throughout history those things were harder to come by than they are today, and there was no such thing as sugar, or corn fed beef, etc.

"c0m8ook","I'm planning to grow my first garden this summer too, under the direction of my grandmother. It's very important that you find out what zone you're in (just google planting zones and your zip code) so that you know the best time for planting. Also make sure you till your ground first and you might want to put in some sort of fertilizer, depending on your soil quality and the last time stuff was planted there. Folks at your local gardening store should be able to help you figure out what you need. 

Tomatoes and cucumbers are really easy to grow and usually yield a lot of fruit. Cucumbers need something to climb (a wire fence, etc.). Bell peppers are also easy and delicious. If you have a LOT of space you might want to grow some corn; homegrown, fresh corn is DELICIOUS but you need to have a good amount of plants because they need to cross-pollenate. Also you might want to look into roots and gourds, like squash, zucchini, and pumpkins, if you have a lot of room. Strawberries are good too, and don't need a lot of space or work. 

The biggest things to make sure of are your soil quality (if it's low you'll want to fertilize), special needs (lots of space, something to grow up), and sunlight. Different plants need different sunlight. The internet and people in gardening centers can be really helpful with all of this.

"c0kr380","*First off you should know unless you hire a nutritionist, a trainer and someone to watch over you and make sure you follow everything it'll take time. 

*December 2007 I weighed 310 lbs

*December 2009 I weighed 187 lbs

*February 2010 I weigh 202 lbs (Super bowl and Xmas cookies)

*What I've done personally is something you've done already. Giving up soda is very important. Each bottle of soda has about 200 calories, if you think bat it, that‚Äôs at least 10 minutes on the treadmill.  Now slowly cut back on the sugars. I wouldn‚Äôt suggest giving it up completely because that‚Äôs not realistic at all I don‚Äôt care what anyone says. I always have some amount of grapes, apples and pears in my refrigerator. If I have that urge for sugars or feel like I need candy, I snack on the fruits instead.

*Now, I wouldn‚Äôt blame you for still eating candy because its jus amazing and delicious but just keep tabs on what you eat. If you like eating stuff like chips and things of that sort, I‚Äôd suggest Herr‚Äôs Veggie Crisp or Plantain Chips, while still not a healthy choice it is lower on calories than the other common options and they still taste good. Another thing that‚Äôs always good to have on hand are granola and protein bars. I personally like the one Kellogg‚Äôs make called chocolate crisps and Fiber one‚Äôs chocolate chip and oatmeal bars.

*I personally love steaks and burgers, hoagies are delicious too. But you can‚Äôt eat any of those for a few months during your time to get in better shape. If you come to my house and open my refrigerator along with the fruits and vegetables what you would find skinless chicken, plenty of lunch meat mostly turkey and chicken (not a fan of ham), fish fillets and eggs. I try not to fry any of these instead I went out and bought a grill and a George Foreman (it gets really cold in the winter here in Philly). 

*Coffee is always good, caffeine increases your metabolism and any bit helps. My personal favorite is tea; I wouldn‚Äôt recommend buying iced tea. The cheapest way to do it, buying green tea or black tea bags from Wal-Mart or target and making it yourself. Tea helps in lowering your appetite and it also makes you feel better. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend using sugars or creamer‚Äôs when it comes to tea, if you absolutely need something I‚Äôd recommend honey. But if you‚Äôre going to drink coffee, sugars are a good idea.

*Another thing I always have on hand is a big tub of protein powder. I usually start my day off with 20oz worth of a protein shake. One quarter milk and three quarters water it usually fills you up and kindda discourages you for eating a lot. 

*Now that was it about foods now please don‚Äôt not skip out on your meals eat six times a day 

*I‚Äôd start the day with a light breakfast, preferably oatmeal and some fruits or hard boiled eggs or something of that sort along with a protein shake.

*Now sometime in the middle of the day I‚Äôd eat a protein bar along with some tea.

*Now for lunch, I eat a chicken sandwich (lunch meat) on rye or multigrain bread with lettuce. If you want condiments lite mayo is the best option. Again I accompany the meal with tea and sometimes veggie crisp.

*In between lunch and dinner another protein bar or a meal replacement bars.

*For dinner, I prefer a bigger meal usually grilled chicken and some brown rice or a salad it is delicious and a very healthy option

*Lastly before you go to sleep I recommend eating fruits and a protein shake

*I know I put the fruits last but I always eat them throuought the day. One way to stop eating a lot is when you‚Äôre hungry or before a meal I do a set of sit ups and crunches. I know it sound ridiculous but by then your abs and stomach are contracted due to the exercise and you feel like eating less. Another thing that helps a lot is drinking a glass of water before you eat. This way you feel fuller and you eat less anyway.

*All these things should help. I‚Äôve been doing this for about 2-3 years and it‚Äôs made me feel better one thing you‚Äôll notice is that you lose 20-30 lbs pretty fast and you‚Äôd feel like relaxing on the diet. But don‚Äôt the next 20-30 lbs is very hard and stubborn. 

*Oh yea one last thing and that is please go join a gym, LA fitness is about $40, retro fitness is about $20 and there are some that at cheaper. I personally go to LA because they have racquetball courts and a sauna, two of my favorite aspects of the gym. The way I justify the $40 is convincing myself that if I had $40 I would have definitely spent that on food and the gym is a much better investment. 

*Start out with lots of cardio like 40 minutes on the treadmill (I usually just jog or walk) and about 20 minutes on the elliptical or a stationary bike. If done right you would burn an average of 400-600 calories. For the first 6 months I did an hour of cardio and about 40 minutes of weights and 20 minutes in the sauna. So that‚Äôs about 2 hours at the gym and you might think that‚Äôs a lot of time but I can assure you that there‚Äôs two hours in a day that you can spare. Now I do about and hour and a half of weights and half hour of cardio.

*I can‚Äôt stress how important the gym is. Even if you decide to eat like a pig, going to the gym will make a lot of change in your life and you would also notice a change in your attitude. You‚Äôll instantly feel happier and a boost in your energy levels.

*I am not a nutritionist or a trainer or an expert in any way. This is just something I‚Äôve done personally and it‚Äôs worked for me. I do realize you have a tonne of responses from this post but if any of it fails this could help.

*I hope it helps, and if you don‚Äôt believe me that I‚Äôve changed, here are a couple links that show me before and after. It‚Äôs me when I was about 250-60ish and the other is about a month ago and I‚Äôm 203 in that picture

Well, its hard to say what you can do when I don't know the rest of your inventory so Ill try to give you some alternatives:
Chopped ham with scrambled eggs on toast. - Decently filling and hot.
If you want it more filling you can melt some Pepper Jack into that, tough I never tasted that myself, so do at own risk.

Pasta with tuna, add in spicing as you see fit, I usually spice it up with black pepper some vinegar and mushroom soy and then fry it for about a min. - Very delicious if you like tuna, and very filling. Also good with cheese in it. (Everyone should have tuna at home at all times, it is what we will have to eat after the apocalypse. Learn to love it ^^ ).

What we in Sweden call ""Fattiga Riddare"", translates as ""Poor Knights"" is delicious. Whip up 2 or 3 eggs and then dip bread in it until the bread soaks up some egg. Fry in a pan with lots of butter. Enjoy with sugar or cheese. - Very delicious, but more of a sweet thing than food, not so filling.

Thats all I can think of now :/ I know two of my recepies contained eggs, but its one of those ingredients that holds for months and can be used in almost every meal.

Good luck with your quest for food!

"c0dboo6","First off, congratulations on your goal and your realistic way of trying to accomplish it! I sympathize, since I guess I probably was about where you are now, a year ago.

Through the same kinds of lifestyle changes you are looking to do (as everyone says, they can be summarized by exercise more and eat more healthily, but the devil is in the details) I have lost 40 pounds (from 340 to 300) in the last year and am continuing to gradually do so.

I have four tips that have helped me, two about food, and two about exercise.

1. Don't eat less total food. Eat as much food, but with a lower calorie value. Actually eating less food is unhelpful because you'll feel hungry. Therefore, look for foods that are not calorie dense. Foods with plenty of fiber also have this property. If I eat some oatmeal or some brown rice or some beans, it'll really fill me up more than the equivalent amount of french fries. Do NOT be hungry.
2. I find that I often end up eating less nutritious food, eating out, etc due to bad planning (aka no planning) more than anything else. If you don't actually have the ingredients to make healthy, delicious food, don't know off the top of your head something you could make quickly, etc, etc, and suddenly you're hungry, you're probably going to go eat a pizza or something. So I had to gradually learn to plan ahead. It didn't happen overnight. I'm still getting better at it. There's lots of things you can do. For example, one idea that's caught on with me is making a bunch of food at once occasionally (like a huge pot of delicious but nutritious soup) and then freezing portions I can just heat up sometime. It probably really depends on you, but the point is that planning matters and you need to figure out what'll work for you so you're not just suddenly hungry and the only appealing options for eating within 15 minutes are unhealthy ones.

3. Look around for exercise activities that you actually really, really enjoy. Even if it takes some time exploring to find that activity or activities, it'll be worth it. It's much easier to stick with it if you're actually kind of looking forward to doing it because it's kind of fun. For me, I've found swimming and biking are tons of fun. It varies, I suppose. Don't buy into ""no pain, no gain.""
4. Routine is the most powerful tool I've found for keeping on track with exercise, and it seems like almost everybody who exercises regularly that I've talked to would agree.

So in both exercise and food, the summary of this advice is (a) Find a way to be healthy that is still appealing and fun, because if it's not, it will be hard to stick to, and (b) planning matters; you can be unhealthy just due to poor planning and so on.

The more successful I've gotten at this, the more I've realized how outreagously awful and unhelpful the idea of will power is to weight loss and staying healthy. I would not buy into it.

"c09nvq9","I never did it until about one year ago. On a whim, being a free man with lots of free time, finally with some new friends that were keen to the idea, I decided to go for it. Up until then I would enjoy drinking regularly, getting drunk occasionally. 

The first time I did it was pretty crazy. The stuff we had was very, very decent, and I got serious couchlock, because it was a totally new feeling. 

The next few times I learned to smoke it with a bit more consciousness of what I was doing. I would take a few minutes after each hit and feel out how I was feeling--trying to feel where I was sufficiently toasted without being off-my-ass high. Eventually I got it down. 

Now I do it on a pretty regular (once a week, sometimes a little leess) basis. I know that I only need a few puffs on a normal day to get a nice little buzz going. I don't slam a half a quart of vodka every time I want a drink, so why would I rip myself silly every time I smoke? 

The munchies... must be careful about this. I definitely put on some weight after I first started... One thing I've learned is that I must have HEALTHY snacks at home---the first dozen times I would stock up on total junk, and oh yeah, it was totally amazing and delicious, but fresh veggies and fruit are also incredible! 

I am a beer snob, and I know this sounds like a total stoner thing, but I can taste an incredible depth of flavors in a good beer after a little toking.  

Since learning how to balance my high, getting to that 'just right' spot, I can have an absolute BLAST spending an evening at home alone. Playing a video game, lifting some weights, playing guitar, it can turn a 4 hour block of time into what seems like an entire day of having fun. And after it's all done, you can sober up and feel totally fine, or you can go to sleep, have a WONDERFULLY relaxing night's sleep, and wake up with no hangover.

I guess there are some downsides, the paranoia has gotten hold of me a few times. There was one time at my friend's house I was totally convinced that the police were coming, and I heard a siren outside, and I managed to make everyone in the apartment freak out like a roost of chickens. We were whisper-yelling, grabbing all of our paraphernalia and heading for the bathroom, trying to hold our breath in total silence. It was not funny at that exact moment, but we laugh about it now. 

Another time I was listening to music alone with my huge headphones, and I could NOT believe the fact that the speakers were not turned on. I kept removing the headphones, totally convinced that the music was blasting loud enough to wake the neighbors.

If you are a straight-laced type that hasn't put much thought into the ways of the world/life/work, you may have some revelations and you may not feel so inclined to run blindly on the rat wheel of life. I have been wary of this kind of stuff since I was about 11, so it didn't do a whole lot, except enforce my feelings that we are really not in control of very much in our own lives.

Okay, I think I wrote enough... any other questions?

"c086e1e","If you have a problem with people not feeling bad over the loss of farm chickens when compared to the eagle then you are at least condemning the idea that different levels of value should be placed on different expressions of life.

I'm pretty sure I just asked you two questions in my previous comment but both were ignored by you. I want to know how factory farming hurts biodiversity more than the destruction of an entire genetic lineage. While we're at it, why don't you put value on different forms of life? Do you not cherish the things you have less of more?

You don't seem to be getting what I'm saying about such assertions placing value on something. The assertions are part of reality and they change the amount of appreciation an object has. You keep acting like I am dodging your question and bring up notions of difference between claims and facts, but it is evident that:

1. People place value on the eagle because of its meaning to their lives and ideologies (I've mentioned this before but you've ignored  my explanation...e.g. people like to see underdogs win as a reflection of how an individual flourishes in society)

2. People place value on the amount of information and data that could have been collected about the bird that now can no longer be collected. The bird serves no use to the scientific community.

We can't drop the concept of a degree of mourning because that's not how it works. I can feel sorrow for the amount of suffering put into the food I eat, but it can be outweighed by the pleasure I feel in eating it.

My analogy works. These actually are two things that people like to have around albeit for different reasons. I can like the red candies because they are plentiful and delicious, but I can also like the orange candies because of their unique properties and rarity. I don't mind the loss of a red candy because I can fulfill my desire with another. I do mind the loss of an orange candy because I can never have an orange candy again and it meant something special to me because of its unique properties.

We're still talking about one group of things murdered with impunity and another group of things whose death causes collective frustration. We have plenty of red candies, so why should I feel bad? We don't have many more orange candies, so I have irritation towards those who took my orange candies away.

"c299l9","Eh, I use a lot of cans of campbells soup in my cooking so that I don't have to chop veggies or any of that stuff.  This is mainly for single living, but you could feed two if you had to.

1)  Brown some hamburger, cook some macaroni.  Mix both in a big bowl with 2 cans of v8 and 1 can of diced tomatoes.  This is easy and delicious.  I eat this two or three times a month.  You can even buy flavored cans of tomatoes (basil and oregano, or chili style) for variety.

2)  Brown some hamburger.  When it is done mix in a can of chicken and rice soup, cream of mushroom, and half a can of ""Chowmein noodles"" and a can of mixed vegetables, and half of one of the soup cans of water.  Stir well.  Spread in a glassware pan (spray with nonstick spray), then cook for a half hour at 350F.  This is also delicious and I eat it at least three times a month.

3) Peeling potatoes was a bitch until I saw a youtube video on how to do it quickly.  Get russet potatoes, peel them, cut them into eh 12-18 smaller chunks, simmer in a pot at a near boil for around 40-45 minutes stirring occasionally.  When they are done, mash them in the pot, add a bit of milk until they are soft and creamy.  While you were cooking the potatos, brown some hamburger, when it is done mix in a can of mushroom soup and half a can of water and use that as gravy.  This is also delicious, but I don't have it as much because peeling the potatoes is still kind of a pain.

4)  Cook macaroni, mix in a can of tomato soup.  Just make sure you don't put in too much macaroni or you will dilute it too much.  I wouldn't live on this but it is good once a month and is very easy.

5)  Edit: I'll add one more.  Boil water and add spaghetti, only make sure you break the spaghetti into small chunks no more than 1-1.5 inches long.  If you don't do that it will be a disaster.  Brown some hamburger.  Mix in the spaghetti, hamburger and a can of cheddar cheese soup.  Try not to make too much spaghetti or you will dilute the cheese and it will be nasty.

*Browning the hamburger just means spray a pan with nonstick spray, put it in the pan, add a little salt and pepper, cook on medium, stirring until it is well done.  Optionally cut up some onions and mix them in before cooking.
