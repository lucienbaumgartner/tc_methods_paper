"fyx1owi","There's basically two sets of laws:

Federal agents are allowed to enforce federal laws in states. In this case, they're invoking defending the destruction of federal property (which would be a crime).

The second is that agencies like CBP have broad authority anywhere within 100 miles of the border (including oceans), to enforce border security. 

The problem with the first one is that they're clearly going beyond just defending the buildings themselves. That doesn't give them the ability to arrest protesters and the like.

The second is likely legal (SCOTUS came up with the 100mi limit), and it's been a huge problem. 100 miles of any border in the US is basically most of the US, including basically every major city. It's insane but legal.

Those laws also just allow them to operate, though. Even in cases where they're legally there, they're still not supposed to be violating things like due process (which grabbing people suspected of protesting is a violation).

There's a good chance some of this will eventually be ruled illegal. The problem is the time/effort it takes, and this is still going on. Unless a judge gives an injuction, it could be a while. And in a lot of cases, even if it's illegal, the result is basically the courts telling the government ""you can't do this"", and that's about it.",1595454593,"it's insane but legal.","insane but legal","insane","but",FALSE,"insane but legal","legal",NA,NA,1

"fpmjy7y","I definitely skew the statistic. I dont remember when I first saw porn... though given the internet that age range sounds close. But I had 0 sex ed, growing up in a hyper religious family had me not aware of such things. But being gay on top of that really cemented the whole ""I dont understand"" sentiment around porn until my early teens. Honestly if it weren't for furry porn, I'd probably be still struggling with my sexuality. I guess the nature of it's ""imagination"" and artwork and stories allowing one to imagine what they want, even if they arent aware it's what they want is what propelled me to realize I wasnt straight. I still remember just not understanding the big deal since I'd see naked women and it wouldnt do anything for me.

I'm not really sure the approach I'd take if I were able to change things like this post suggests. Like obviously this is laughable and insane. But there is a question of should underage people be able to discover these things on their own and at what age? And I just dont know. I think the best thing is an environment where there isnt shame around such things, where a child should feel embarrassed or like their parents will be mad if they come and ask a question. I think putting a child lock on a computer is... not the right approach. No locks, but rather monitoring software for kids. You gotta make sure no creeps are getting to them. 

There need to be societal changes. Sex ed should come earlier in school. Not getting into anything graphic, but just explaining these things are normal. But since we know a lot of parents wont be there, we should have teachers or counselors kids feel comfortable talking to and asking questions. Conservatives would freak, but kids need someone to talk to, and the whole ""it is unspoken"" shit the extremely religious put out there is not helping. I can't imagine how my life would change had I grown up in a household knowing ""boys can like boys and girls can like girls"". It doesnt even have to be sex education. Something innocent like John Oliver's bunny book, just anything to get the notion into their heads that its normal. 

If I were to ever raise a kid in a hypothetical world where I'm with a woman, I'd start at a young age reading children's books like that John oliver one. As young as 2 or 3. Where the boy bunny wants to hop with the other boy bunny. Probably around 5 or so I'd introduce the fact boys can feel like girls and girls can feel like boys, without any pressure, just in casual conversation. I wouldnt give a child access to a computer until they're at least 9 or so. And then I'd have monitoring software. I wouldn't block anything, but I'd watch what sites they've visited, just to make sure they're safe. But by 12 I think privacy is a thing kids should have. Make the environment open and accepting they can come to you and ask questions or tell you something, but also step back and let them figure things out. But yeah, sex ed in school should be around 11 to 12. It should be just before entering puberty. Fucking high school sex ed? Really? I know people want to project innocence on their children, but like, they're gonna go through puberty, explain BEFORE that about this shit, so we dont end up with pregnant high schoolers. Proper sex ed leads to less problems. Less suicides... I know I'm coming at this from a warped perspective, given my upbringing. And yeah, the majority of kids are going to be cis and straight. I just wish I had a school system to talk to when I was younger and struggling. 

Well that was a long winded rambling rant. 

Tl;Dr teach sex ed at an age before puberty, and tell kids it's okay to be gay or trans, and give them a safe place to go to to ask questions without having to be embarrassed, cause you can be damn sure home isnt that place.",1588734729,"like obviously this is laughable and insane.","laughable and insane","insane",NA,FALSE,"laughable and insane","laughable",NA,NA,0

Just as you stated you went through a horrible custody process, no parent should have to watch their kids be in situations or with people that mean them no good. These judges don't care about our children as they claim. And something needs to be done. I'm not going to suck it up and deal with it when I know I should have my daughter. I have to look out for her best interests even when others aren't or when she isn't of age to fully understand. And I'm not saying ""everyone is against me"" like a kid or for petty.

It would not be remotley justifiable if was just one person. But one of the harsh truths about china is their groupthink collectivist nature. They know they are subjected to propaganda. They know their laws are unjust. They know their leaders are malevolent. They know all of this and yet they support the ccp anyway because majority rules and thats all that matters. What works is the right way to do things over there. Ends and means dont come into question the same way. The same behavior pours into chinese culture as well. If one thing works, then everyone does it and it floods the market.  Thats insane but also fine because markets self correct enough to move people to alternatives. But when the government is the subject there is no room for competition, they allow absolute power to the ccp and since theres nothing else combatting it, it just get more saturated with reckless policy yet nothing can stop it because it has the power to write off failures with a snap. The ccp controls big business, media, banking, financial policy, money printing, the miitary, social hierarchy ect. If their economy fails they can literally print more money off the books largely circumventing inflation and bail it out as if nothing ever happened. They then turn their secretly worthless currency into dollars, euros ect via manufacturing. This is why they need to control hong kongs ports and will stop at nothing to get it.

Nuking china is about to be as justifiable as nuking japan was if they dont start to show any signs of change. Every variable weighed then is just magnified now. It wasnt a benevolent play in the short term but the japanese made it clear that they would not stop supporting their government and their government would not stop. Yes, loads of innocent people were killed but how many innocent lives were saved? We will never know but thats the gamble and at some point, gambling is the best option for everything, like it or not. Theres a lot more nukes now than there were when the fat man and little boy fell and thats the only reason the us or any other country likely wont nuke them.

We waited a day to see where her reality was at, then we placed her in a hospital (where she would end up finding her current husband and father of her child). 
 
What to do during halluications or anything ""delusional"" is DO NOT FORCE YOUR REALITY ON HER. You know how bad it feels when someone gaslights you, the lack of trust, the sense of betrayal, feeling hurt because you are being dismissed, multiply that by 1000 and thats how much it helps telling a delusional grand parent or hallucinating friend. 
 
Believe her. Trust her. You see she isn't well, but you can't make her better. Go through the ride with her. Unless she puts herself in immedate danger, don't try and break her reality. 
 
Hearing about her rapes, I would put her in involuntary care for this. I am a victim and survivor of many rapes. How deeply one messes with you is insane, but multiple, it ruins people, and changes them, and scars them. She will need professional guidance to get back to our reality, then more professional guidance to find her self esteem, her self confidance, her self image. 
 
I have a theory on why people have these breaks during traumatic stress. The brain is low on the happy hormones and recorded and saved something horrible. To try and erase that memory it pulls energy from different parts of the brain (panic amd anxiety), as the trauma continues or the brain keeps remembering it, it digs deeper crossing the wires of dreaming (because dreaming is safer than memories), finally here it finds a way to numb itself. Enough time has passed for the feel good hormomes to do their thing. (Oxytocin: makes you feel good or makes you dream.) Now you half dreaming, half away, self drugged. The thing is the brain once it enters the deep resovoirs of pain reduction it becomes harder and harder to leave, making the psychosis do the memory loop vs memories doing the loop. This is my theory as to why some psychotic breaks you are only left with a feeling afterwards but no memory, you don't remember your dreams so why would you remember you delusions. Imagine being addicted to pain killers, your brain is both its user and supplier, that is why professionals should handle delusions and hallucinations and psychotic breaks.

This topic in particular is why I developed a nicotine dependency in college. And it’s not adhd doing this, it’s meds. And delving into an even more overarching topic is that, when taking stimulants, I tend to lose focus on my body. 

The whole point of having a brain is to control your body. Like, from a really basic point of view. But we’re in a freaky weird point in evolution. I think that adhd diagnoses are increasing because we’re forcing our brains to act more like computers than organs. And that’s insane, but necessary at this point in time. 

Stimulants are great at compensating for that discrepancy. But so is meditation, exercise, etc. 

To use your brain effectively, you have to use your body consistently. Meds can help, as we all know, but regular exercise helps more than anything else. Running is my favorite, lifting is more of a chore. Do push ups, squats, whatever you can do. Personally, I try to sit down, turn off the TV, and focus on breathing and relaxing my muscles at least once a day. It helps with my baseline focus/mood. 

So yeah. Meds help everything. But so does using your body as it’s been evolved to do so.

&gt; The only group who doesn't like them are the Whitecloaks, 

This comment is insane, but very telling on how much you've read.  Or how much you comprehended, which I suppose IS different.    


First, notice I didn't say Aes Sedai?  I said ""channelers"" -- Seanchans enslaved them with the collars and treated them like animals.  Sharans (thanks for that by the way, wasn't about to google it at 2am posting from my phone) seized them at childhood and made them state property.  Women who found that they could channel went into hiding to avoid Aes Sedai recruiters (huge part of the story).   As for Aes Sedai, Tear arrested and killed them on sight.  White Cloaks thought they there were literally creatures of the dark one, and many kingdoms were influenced by them.  And if that's not enough, the common people *everywhere* blamed all channelers for the breaking of the world, and commonly portrayed Aes Sedai as villains in stories.  And while many Kings and Queens had advisors that were Aes Sedai, the only Kingdom that did it openly south of the borderlands was Andor.    


AND IF THAT WASN'T ENOUGH -- Male channelers being hunted and killed because the taint will drive them mad IS one of driving forces of the (early) narrative.  You'd know that if you had *actually* read the books and not just WoTwiki (which might be unkind to you specifically mpetey123, you're just seemingly joining forces with white supremacists).   


But again, my original argument that this is the only thing that comes even CLOSE to Sherpa's definition of ethnic conflict in WoT.

"exddz41","Because murder is a natural part of the human condition. Monkeys have been shown to have a similar incidence rate of murder compared to humans. Killing is natural, as it is what we do as a species. That is why we have laws prohibiting it in order to live a human society. 

The poster above is assuming an eliminative materialist position. Brain scans cannot assume mental states. They don’t diagnose psychiatric disorders or some neurological ones. In medical terms, it is not pathognomic. It does not rule in or rules out a psychiatric disorder like schizophrenia. The use of fMRI to detect brains of killers is correlational at best. If used it court it will not by itself be enough to sustain an insanity defense. Not definitively.

 The insanity defense has a long history, especially in the western world. The insanity defense (varies by state and country), but in the US it has two statues (mostly). 

A. One that the person has a mental defect or disorder. 

B. Second that the mental defect or disorder was ACTIVE during the actions of the crime. 

Other states have statues like  “substantial capacity to appreciate the criminality of \[their\] conduct"" that is an extremely high bar to reach, which is beyond the scope of this reply. The insanity defense is used only by the defense, as it is up the defense attorney to prove those above statues. 

Now let's see how murderers are not insane. Insanity is a legal term, not a medical one. To find someone insane that is to find someone fulfilling the statues above. Insanity can be found by doing an intensive IME (independent medical evaluation). This consists of psychological testing, medical record review, and a psychiatric interview (etc.). This can be done by either a psychologist or a psychiatrist. IME's are a long and rigorous process that can take days. Plus, your report will be attacked by the opposing attorney and other forensic experts/expert witnesses. Thus, if a person does not meet the insanity defense they are not insane, but are guilty of XYZ. 

Now more information about the American legal system. One can be found guilty of a crime, not guilty, not guilty due to insanity (NGRI), not not guilty (aka unfit to stand trial, extremely sick), or guilty but insane or mentally ill"".  Guilty is when a person is found guilty of breaking a law or committing a crime. NGRI is when a person fulfills the statues above for the insanity defense. Not Not guilty as a person is unable or unfit to stand trial. They are so sick they cannot understand the charges against them and are set to a psychiatric hospital for treatment until they are fit for trial or other circumstances. Guilty but mentally ill or insane (depending on the wording of a statue) is the judge or a jury recognizing that mental illness played a rule in the act of the crime, but the person is still guilty because it did not meet the above insanity statues for finding someone NGRI.

I had a friend that thought I was insane for walking away from my marriage.   My ex had just finished her training as an MD/Phd, and would have supported me, so long as I never really reached my potential (she had strong narc traits, and was very threatened by the idea that I might overshadow her, yes, really).  But, she was happy to support me while I used pot to deal with the depression I had.  As I told her when I left her, you defile the goodness in me, and you encourage the broken in me.  When I left, I felt like there was nothing left of me, but I rose out of that, and am making 3x what I made 5 years ago as a programmer, and doing very well.  But isn't that what the message is about, that in order to find life, we must be willing to die, to let all that is broken go, and rise out of the ashes?  A comfortable life meant nothing to me if it was a life without meaning.  I did the same thing when my parents disowned me for pursuing music at age 19.  I refused to budge until they came back months later, risking homelessness.  Comfort is far less attractive to me than it is most people.  I would much rather live in a world with exciting possibilities, but a risk of severe consequence, than die of the protracted terminal illness known as stagnation.

That's not to say that I go to efforts to make mistakes, miss the mark, or sin.  Instead, it is that I believe that often times the real sin is failing to take a chance so one can delude themselves into thinking they are perfect.

Making mistakes matters less to me than my overall trajectory.  Course corrections are ok, so long as I am attempting to head in the right direction.

What the Therapist is REALLY good for is post raid if you lost 300 HP and one leg and both arms are blacked out, you can spend 10K rubles and instead of having a 1 hour recovery time you have maybe a 5-10 minute one, but never instantaneous, meaning you can alternate between scav and PMC even at high levels and still have a purpose, and people will treat their scavs better because if they charge in and die, they have to wait a little while to fully recover their PMC or get a new scav. She may also still provide insurance, maybe. 

Prapor: provides insurance, and can provide you with shitty guns that are overpriced, but still cheaper than Mechanic or Peacekeeper. 

Mechanic: specialist at repairing weapons, and will trade you vital parts to a gun for optional weapon mods, as well as trade you optional mods for novelty items like the Bitcoin (obviously not the bitcoin though, because ~90k for a red dot sight is absolutely insane, but more pricey mods could still go for bitcoins) also will trade you weapons cases eventually if you do enough quests.

Skier: provides you with quicker scav runs in exchange for limiting that scav run to one or two maps. Imagine a Skier Scav that is a little more decked out, but must complete a mission in map (one that is pretty generic but will still force you to go out of your way) and you can loot while doing it. There is no penalty for killing other scavs, but if you fail the mission you must give an amount that is told to you at the beginning of the quest as ""Tribute"" before you can take your stuff. Imagine a quest where you either have to find him something like a folder with intelligence, of which there are a few spawns in a map and 1 or 2 guaranteed spawns when you accept the quest (if nobody is going for that quest the spawns are not guaranteed) and if you fail to find one and extract the charges you 60k rubles worth of gear. The upside is you start with better shotguns or rifles, and usually will have armour or a helmet, and a mediocre bag and rig. 

Mechanic: money is near worthless to Mechanic, so most of his trading will be barter. He can repair weapons as well, but charges a lot because he is the best in his class and is constantly bogged down with requests. The gunsmith quests can also have similar quests where you are given a broken gun, have to get a working part for the gun, and turn it back in when you have it. If you do this he will reward you with some cash or something, but also reduced prices on repairs because you saved him time. This reduction could be permanent or limited. The gun he gives has to have a tag where it will not be compatible with your weapon slots. 

Peacekeeper: the best of the best for paying cash, everything he sells is worth money or something similar, but most of everything is overpriced as hell. Probably won't have many quests, but those that he does have allow you to buy even more things.

"ehevu46","/r/Baccano mod here...unfortunately doing what I did two days ago, which is to write a comment for this episode on the same day the next episode (12.5 in this case) is due to go up. Welp.

I'm not keen on spending the same amount of time on this comment as I did Episode 11's, so I'm going to try to keep this on the shorter side (and I imagine some will be relieved, heh). 

I believe the confrontation between Seiji, Mika, Celty, and Mikado didn't happen out in the open space of the square like it seems to do here. 

In the novel, Celty and Mikado hide in the shadows of an alleyway near the square to avoid being picked up by the police. (Since Mikado is wearing his school jacket in the LN, he's worried that will definitely identify him/lead to punishment). None of the passersby snitch to the police, and the police leave.

Once they do, Celty walks back to the van where ""her head [is] sitting"" aka the amnesiac girl (Mika) -- and Seiji stabs her in the back unexpectedly, as opposed to her taking the blade purposefully in Mikado's stead. Seiji hops into the van, with none of the watching Van Gang trying to stop him, and pulls Mika out of the van: ""I've come for you. Let's go.""

And Mika agrees. All (except Izaya) are in varying degrees of shock. Seiji tells Mikado that he (Seiji) owes a lot to Mikado and Namie; Mikado starts to ask if Seiji really killed someone, Seiji says he ""might"" have, and he cites the power of love. The others surround him, he compares Mikado to a ""third-rate villain"" and assumes Mikado has never been in love; he swings the scalpel downward...

..At which point Celty swings down with her blade, which he dodges. Ultimately Mika does step in front of the scythe's path and scream, ""Stop!"" The clips shown of Mika outside Seiji's door are taken from the Prologue, which if you remember is where the scene with Seiji by (Mika's) body also came from.

Seiji having failed to recognize Mika's 'head' was not the real ting... *ouch*.

""You're definitely not a stalker"" / Mikado just because you say she wasn't acting out of selfishness doesn't mean her actions weren't stalker-y...

Shinra, you selfish little... \*cue unkind grumblings*.

From the novel:

&gt; “I’m not going to say that I’ll give up if that’s truly what will make you happy. This is a battle of your love against mine. Remember what I said? I will spare no effort in seizing victory in our game of fate. So that poor girl—Mika, her name was? I used her in an attempt to make you give up on your head. I’m not going to let you go. I will use the love of others, their deaths, my own self, even your own emotions to keep you here—as contradictory as that sounds.” 

&gt; In a way, his words were extremely twisted and insane, but there was no doubt clouding his eyes. That was what broke Celty’s will. If he’d played dumb or given her some lame excuse, she would have beaten him until he couldn’t stand and left, never to return. But after such a strong, direct statement of intent, Celty had no response.

Celty's jabbed/poked at Shinra before, but the punch she gives him here is... Well, there's some real serious emotion that led up to that punch, and Shinra's non-punch back seriously does not excuse the crap he's pulled. Oooh, you sneaky, no-good...

Mika leading a stunned Seiji around...that boy sure had a nasty shock, huh. Teenagers. I swear.

&gt; Kadota and Izaya meet, old high school classmates that they are

&gt; Izaya immediately calls him his hated nickname Dotachin

&gt; Erika calls him Dotachin

Poor Kadota just can't catch a break. I *think* the scene where he speaks with Izaya (in person for the first time in ages) + the Izaya-Mikado conversation is meant to happen *before* the Seiji-Mika reveal...

...Eh, what's more important is highlighting what Izaya remarked to Mikado:

&gt; “But while you may be dreaming of a life outside the bounds of normality, life in Tokyo will become normal after you’ve been here for a year. If you still want the abnormal, you’ll need to either move somewhere else or get into drugs, prostitution, or whatever lies even deeper underground.""

&gt; [...] “Life becomes normal even for the people on the other side of the tracks. Take the plunge for yourself, and you’ll be used to it in three days. And people like you can never bear that. ...If you truly want to escape the ordinary, you’ll simply need to keep evolving—whether what you seek is above or below.”

(From the YP translation).

*That* is definitely something to remember for the coming episodes/seasons.

Anyway... Shizuo doesn't show up and do his ""Iiiizaaayaaa"" routine here in the LNs. Mikado simply bows as Izaya leaves; Izaya turns around, says he's been wanting to glimpse the person who created something ""as dumb as"" the Dollars, and does the ""Hang in there, Tarou Tanaka!"" namedrop as he walks off. 

I think this isn't the only time the anime's decided to throw in extra Shizuo-Izaya rivalry scenes/amp it up, I but don't quote me on that. It's *probably* safe to say they really like capitalizing on it.

**Seiji:** I don't love you, but I guess you're a reminder of my love/dedication toward the real deal, soooo okay sure, I'll accept your love until I get her back. then it's quits, sweet cheeks

**Mika:** I was born ready and have no problems with this arrangement. [She thinks this next bit in the volume, but the anime cuts out her reply so I think they're saving this specific sentiment for the future](/s ""in the meantime I will sacrifice everything for you and do whatever it takes to help you find the real head. You know, so I can eat it and become it. for your sake."")

&gt; A love between them that would last until the moment their true love came true. 

&gt; A love that was so straightforward and so terribly twisted.

&gt; The sight of them was so delicate and precious--and so horribly, horribly wrong. 

(From the LN). Yeah honestly Narita that might be a bit of an understatement....

This episode explicitly confirms TarouTanaka = Mikado and Setton = Celty for the viewers who didn't fully appreciate either up to this point. 

Mikado is surprised to see Seiji and Mika attending classes, but between the two he's more surprised that Mika's showed up. Also, I think she's meant to have a bandage around her neck (rather than blatantly exposing the scar to the school)...

I might repeat this factoid later since I'm not sure how many people will return to this episode thread, but: Raira Academy *does* permit students to wear casual clothes, which is while Mika can get away with her attire here... 

...However, although most people are wearing the Raira uniform in the anime, in the novels its actually people who *wear* the uniforms who stand out (e.g. Mikado and Anri). 

&gt; There's that merger with Nebula

As if I were *not* going to call out every mention of Nebula... In this case, Yagiri Pharmaceuticals *and* Nebula have been observing the incidents surrounding [Namie's/Yagiri's] research lab for the past several days, so they've been wanting to finish the merger deal before any more 'nonsense' goes down. 

And Nebula wants ""the dullahan's head,"" of course... But Namie will give the head to them before hell freezes over, so she's fled Yagiri in search of somewhere she can hide the head and have some measure of control over where it might be. 

Izaya, it seems, is her only choice. One of desperation, really. 

Izaya in the LN: *""I think your uncle was a lot like me. He believed in the afterlife less than anyone else. He feared death more than anyone else. And he craved heaven more than anyone else.""

...I told myself this wouldn't be as long as the Episode 11 comment, and look at me now... bleh. I think it didn't take as long to write as Episode 11's comment did, so that's something at least...?! 

With that said, it's 1 PM so there's less than 3 hours until the next episode thread, so I might skip Fanart Corner for this episode (sorry). In any case, we've pretty much wrapped up the first volume with the closing off this arc (the Dollars/Mika Harima arc), so prepare for new shenanigans in the second half...",1551291605,"i will use the love of others, their deaths, my own self, even your own emotions to keep you here—as contradictory as that sounds.”   &gt; in a way, his words were extremely twisted and insane, but there was no doubt clouding his eyes.","twisted and insane","insane",NA,FALSE,"extremely twisted and insane","twisted",NA,"extremely",0

My apologies ahead of time for the incredible length and possible bad formatting, as I’m mobile.

Some context:
This weekend (evening of 1/25-1/27), my husband’s parents came to town to visit us and my husband’s brother &amp; fiancé (both boys live within 10min of each other, a fact that will be covered in “Additional Context”, also, the trip here is 2.5hrs one way, so not crazy far from their house). They got a hotel more or less smack between the two homes thanks to points my FIL earns due to his frequent work travel. Our home is the default place where meetups would occur, due to my BIL &amp; future SIL’s living arrangements, and I would normally not have a single problem with this...
But this is where a kink is thrown into the mix. Sunday (1/20), I began to get a throat tickle, and by Monday night I was full blown sick (cough, sore throat, runny nose, body aches, fever, etc., etc.). My husband notifies his parents of this and they decide to come anyway, because they don’t think their hotel is refundable or reschedulable. Again, I’m fine with this, because I’ll just sit it out, right? By Wednesday (1/23), I’m so sick that I’m at my doc and getting diagnosed with raging bronchitis, and overnight it becomes so bad that I nearly go to urgent care due to my inability to breathe but thankfully was able to reach my doc to have more meds called in. Still, the parents are coming. Cool. Cool cool cool cool.

Further context:
I generally *tolerate* my MIL and my FIL is mostly silent most of the time, so, again, tolerating him is mostly doable. However, it truly is just tolerating them, because of the treatment of my husband his entire life (verbal and physical abuse til adulthood, verbal and emotional abuse continues, also she’s a narcissist who throws tantrums the likes of which I’ve never even seen toddlers throw). We lived with them briefly til just after the holidays 2017-2018, because of a “final straw” incident where the lives of all the animals in the house were put at risk due to her behavior, physical violence was threatened toward us, all of which spiraled into the single worst tantrum I’ve ever seen her throw, which was compounded by my BIL &amp; his fiancé getting involved in the argument, calling both of us all manner of names. We moved as quickly as we had enough money and did not speak to my BIL &amp; fiancé til thanksgiving 2018, though my husband began speaking to his mom (and occasionally his dad) maybe 6-8wks after we gtfo. Both brothers moved to the same area of town and we literally had no clue we were living so close til this past weekend.

Note:
Skip to Sunday if you’d like the majority of the action/issue.

The situation:
When they arrived Friday evening (1/25), we were told the BIL wanted to go to a particular plant based restaurant that, to me, seemed unnecessarily bougie, not to mention a good drive from the house (35min, lots of tolls). My MIL brought a bunch of food she’d made us, and while I’m helping her put it away, I tell her there’s a tea house in town I think she might enjoy (she *loves* tea), and that they have more kinds of tea than I’ve ever seen a single store/cafe carry, all of which she can also buy. She excitedly says she’d love to check it out, and I mention maybe we can do it tomorrow or Sunday if I’m feeling a little better. She enthusiastically agrees. The BIL was late arriving to our house, where we were meeting, which is common. We all had pleasant convo while waiting for him, and because I was still sick, plus I had no interest in paying stupid prices for a veggie burger, I sat this one out. BIL’s fiancé didn’t come coz she was tired. Husband comes home late that night and says he hopes I can come tomorrow. I tell him I’ll see, but it’s tough for me to *want* to spend time with people who’ve treated him so poorly, and he asks me to just tough it out. 

Saturday (1/26), I woke up feeling somewhat alive, but still very hacky, sore throat, tired body, but I thought I could at least make it for a couple small things with them, so we took them to our fave local Chinese restaurant, then we went to a couple Goodwills nearby, where we found some items for my husband’s grandma, and other items, too. I needed to go to Walgreens for further meds and a photo pickup, and the in-laws were to follow, as they needed something. My BIL &amp; fiancé did not come on this outing, as he was working and she had a food tasting class (even though this visit has been on the schedule for like 6wks). They randomly disappear on the way to Walgreens and we’re left sitting there texting MIL to figure out wtf is going on and where we’re going. 
Note: I am a person who does *not* do well without plans when there’s a group of people involved. So this sudden divergence from the plan *slightly* stresses me out, plus I’m overdue for my inhaler and having trouble breathing, so I snapped at my husband about their inability to maintain a simple plan and then not pickup the phone when he calls to see what’s up, forcing us to do everything via text (which she needlessly interjects unrelated memes into, thus taking her longer to reply). My husband agrees we should go ahead and go home so I can take meds. I *did* apologize for snapping at him once I got the meds and was less stressed about the state of my breathing. By the time we got home, though, I was honestly exhausted by the small outings and was again stressed about the possibility of being expected to do more that night. 

An hour or so later, we get a text that they’re at a local cafe that has vegan pies. I had *repeatedly* offered (both in person and via text) to cook a large family meal for *all* of us this particular evening, in an effort to not have to go out, but the MIL and BIL never gave me an answer on this, so hearing that they were just randomly out getting pie was surprising. Still, vegan pies!?!? I was excited and it is *very* close, so we went. There was a single vegan thing on the menu, and it wasn’t pie. So we’re sitting in this crazy busy restaurant, 5 of us (because fiancé is tired from her food tasting class and didn’t come), taking up a table so my BIL can eat the veggie burger and my FIL can eat a BLT while the rest of us sip piss poor tea (a sin in Texas). The whole time we’re there, the BIL is talking about what to do that night. He starts suggesting various bars, including a piano bar, all of which vary from 15min away to back downtown again like last night (35min plus tolls). My in-laws don’t drink at all, I drink rarely (but even now can’t due to antibiotics), and same for my husband. But the BIL keeps pushing things that are primarily booze focused. I’m starting to feel like even though he has repeatedly asked us what we all should do that he actually has all the things planned and is just trying to steer the convo to his end goal/destination/plan. I say I’m pretty tired, but maybe if we all round up back at our house, we can ask my roommate where we should go, as he goes out regularly and would surely have the best recommendations. Finally, my BIL concedes we should come back to our house. Unfortunately my roommate had gone out unexpectedly, so we couldn’t ask him where to go, plus, it had started raining a good amount. After showing him to the alcohol hutch and inviting him to partake as he wished, my BIL agreed we could and should stay in and play a game here. I convinced my in-laws to play Cards Against Humanity, which was crazy and insane but actually fun (seriously, these two senior aged conservatives played some *savage* combos!). I made some oven baked from the freezer vegan snacks for everyone a few hours later and we kept playing til about midnight or so, when I was so tired and hacky that I had to excuse myself to sleep. My in-laws were understanding and thanked me for hosting even though I was sick. It really *did* turn out to be a pleasant evening, which was surprising but welcome. My BIL stayed til almost 4a because he’d had *so much* to drink and needed to sober up, but he was able to sort of reconnect with my husband for the first time in a while. Cool.

Sunday (1/27), my husband gets a text inviting us to brunch at a local well known small chain diner. This is the *only* thing we’re told we’re doing, so I choose to go, thinking we’ll come back here after and then regroup for any additional activities OR that my husband will ride with my BIL (whose fiancé is again not there but no reason given this time) if they choose to leave from there. It’s worth mentioning that we share a vehicle, so we *had* to drive there together. During brunch, my BIL says, ‘Let’s go to Mt. Insertaname after this!’ He’s mentioned it a couple times already over the weekend, and even though I’ve lived here nearly a year, I’d never been. The Mount is a well known scenic overlook for several areas of the city and very touristy (not that the in-laws are new to the city, they’ve been here *many* times). I agree to this **one** thing while we’re eating, because I feel a little better (but nowhere near normal, still very hacky, sore throat but not as bad, and my breathing is still fucked), plus there’s a Trader Joe’s on the way home and I wanted to get a couple staples while near, since I don’t get out there much. So we pay and head out front to regroup after everyone uses the restroom, as my BIL mentions he doesn’t know if Mt. Insertaname has restrooms. We’re just about to go to our respective vehicles when my BIL mentions that he’s riding with my in-laws but he’ll just ride back with us later today. No asking, just telling us that’s what he’ll do. I go along with it, because he really *is* shockingly close to us. So we’re off on our *one* outing that I’ve agreed to.

&gt; So, if the Bolshevik Revolution was funded in order to dismantle the current ruling royal family of Russia (which I don't think this is too far-fetched of an idea, as the Russian royal family didn't seem to be well liked by Western Europe royalty) why?

This question is phrase a bit strangely.  There's no question the Bolsheviks were funded by capitalists.

Sutton's work is clear on this.

https://www.amazon.com/Wall-Street-Bolshevik-Revolution-Capitalists/dp/190557035X

As is Juri Lina's

https://www.amazon.com/Under-Sign-Scorpion-Soviet-Empire/dp/9197289779

There are several other authors that touch on this.  Off the top of my head Solzhenitsyn, MacDonald and Quigley all reference it as well.

&gt; why?

Two primary reasons.  Capitalists don't like monarchies unless they are puppets of capitalists and jews were quickly becoming players on the world wide stage from their constant usury through europe (read about how they brought the Hapsburg to their knees).  The jews had a grudge with the Russian aristocracy because jews always have a grudge with anyone that sit above them and has the power to make decisions over them. This was also a win win for non jewish elites in other countries that saw the Russian aristocracy as a competitor to their own empires.  Basic statecraft shit. The Romanovs like every failed royal family in history just wound up on the wrong side of too many competitors. The Romanovs and russian royal hierarchy/guard/elders also severely underestimated their underclass. This is another common theme is history (see: french revolution).

&gt; Second, was it to destabilize Russia, as we could argue that the west has tried to destabilize Russia multiple times throughout recent history?

Yes.

&gt; If it was to destabilize, then how did the soviet union rise back so well?

Well.  This one is a little more complicated.  They really didn't rise back very well.  After the initial revolution and holodomor's they weren't a very strong power and Hitler was within weeks of totally breaking the soviet union in WWII.  The only reason they weren't wiped out is England and the US were supplying them almost everything to fight the Germans (food, guns, ammo, tanks, you name it).  Even with all that stuff the Germans were getting and 8 to 1 kill ratio early on in the fighting.  The only reason the survived is that Russia had a really really large peasant population and the Russian generals were absolutely brutal with how they deployed these peasants.  There were hundreds of officers with machine guns poised to shoot their own troops if they turned away from the fighting. I will also say in general the the slavic people are tough as fucking nails and the terrible shit they endured in the 20th century only made them tougher.

&gt;  Was Stalin a thorn in the powers to be's side?

Not sure what you mean by this.  Stalin was a tool of the jewish commissars until the purge.  It's WAY easier to understand Russian history if you understand that 80% of the Bolshevik government were JEWS and these jews were absolutely horrendous to the christian slavs.  Read the book 200 Years Together.  It will blow your mind. Stalin did purge most of these jews but not until the 50's. So the slavic people got it from all ends.  They got it from germans in WWI, then from revolutionaries, then from the winning bolsheviks, then from the germans again and then from Stalin after he took full control away from commissars and doubled down on retarded central planning and lykoism (watch the documentary Pandora's box to learn about how insane central economic planning is)

&gt; Ultimately, how could the soviet union have stopped their collapse?

Which collapse?  The collapse of the monarchy after WWI or the Collapse of Bolshevism in the 50's? or the collapse of the entire federation and economic system in the late 80's?

All of those could have been avoided by never allowing the jews into their country.  They also could have been avoided if they would have stayed out of the war and let Hitler gobble up a little of western Russia.

&gt; Also, far as I am aware as I have relatives who were from the soviet union, no soviet person, at least in mainland Russia, said they were communist, but rather they were ""on the path towards communism"", so it's as if communism was really simply a 'tool' used for change...?

Ok this is a good question.  Now I see where some of your confusion is.  Best way to understand why the slavs were so primed for communism is something called 'biological leninism' the Russian people were read for a flip of the current hierarchy and they went about it in the worst most bloody way possible.  

This blog post might enlighten you on why people were so taken aback by leninism and bolshevism. 

https://bloodyshovel.wordpress.com/2017/11/14/biological-leninism/

&gt; Are powers to be simply playing a game of ""gambling""? What's the deal here??

This is where you will probably disagree with me because the answer to this sound evil and insane but the answer to your question lies in the works of Hitler.  In Mein Kampf Hitler explains a lot of this.  Also read Kevin MacDonald's Culture of Critique.  Basically the jewish people are eternal revolutionaries and they totally hijacked the soviet union and used it as their own little psychological experimentation chamber and slave labor country. The jewish people who ran the government never really cared about the 'worker' or about utopia. They only cared about jewish power and jewish supremacism.

 https://i.imgur.com/EV1YgsU.jpg

The current day narrative about russia taught in europe and the US is so convoluted confusing and nonsensical because jews control the commanding heights of the economy in the west and don't like this information getting out.  Jewish Rabbis wouldn't even allow 200 Year Together to be published in the west for 30 years.

And now with this information you step in to what can only be described as a modern day full scale information war.

Welcome to the battlefield.

mod your weapons for lower VATS costs and more crit damage (reflex sights, short barrels, severe or snappy receivers)

Look for instigating weapons (.308 combat rifle would be ideal, good damage, and very low AP cost in VATS for a semi auto rifle). If you need more damage, a gauss rifle will be insane, but slow. In close range, a combat rifle will do wonder, you don't even need shotgun perks. Anti Armour is going to be nice late game, and you could also get the +30% dmg vs. creature types you don't like (maybe +10% players or Zealot if it works vs. scorchbeasts). I found that aiming for the right part with concentrated fire does more than enough dmg. (head, belly, fusions core, face, combat inhibitor, thruster...)

Because of the way armour works, you'll always get more out of semi auto weapons. If you shoot a single 100 dmg bullet at a 100 armour, you'll deal 50. If you shoot two 50 dmg bullets (same damage out of your muzzle) you'll only deal 20x2 dmg. 50% mitigation vs. 61.1% (one of the many reasons Instigating wins vs. Two Shot in burst dps builds).

It's more or less the build I run, and I one-shot most targets. (does great for the durability of your weapons and ammo consumption too).

Chameleon on one or two armour piece will be enough to get sneak bonus on most shots.

A Medic’s weapon can be fun in team, since you crit most shots.

"e9arkry","It has been a bit of a slower week this week, for two reasons. One, my headphones keep crashing and having the audio disappear from every game kinda makes playing them start to be a bit annoying, and two, I have been trying to do some study stuff and have found that taking up more and more time. However, these are the games I have played this week:

&amp;#x200B;

* **Regency Solitaire** \- This game uses the variation of Solitaire where the goal is to remove cards that have been dealt by adding them to the deck if they are one card higher or lower than the current card facing upwards on the deck. So, a 5 can be removed from the board by matching it with a 3 or a 4 on the deck, an Ace matches with a King or a 2, a Jack with a 10 or a Queen, etc. This game gives you power-ups you can use to remove cards from the board; the first allows you to remove one (to begin with) card of your choice from the board; the second allows you to reshuffle all cards on the board; the third allows you to burn several cards on the board at random (removing them basically). There may be more power-ups although I am quite close to the end of the game and haven't seen it yet. You also have a hand of cards that occasionally get added to the bottom right hand corner and the purpose of these cards is for you to put them on the deck to continue a removal streak - basically you will have available to you various cards and Jokers and say you have a 3, 4 and 5 on the board but no way to remove them in your deck, you could take any of a 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 or Joker, put them on the deck face up so you can remove the other cards from the board. I am currently playing the game on Normal and towards the end the difficulty is ramping up quite a bit - one of my current goals is to get a streak of 22 which is insane, but most of these challenges can be brute forced by just replaying the puzzles over and over again and accruing more cards in your 'hand of cards' (I don;t know how else to describe them) that can be used to continue streaks. Oh and this game has a story to it, the story isn't that interesting tbh, the writing is so-so and I play it 100% for the card game aspect but it is at least trying something there.
* **Overwatch** \- So a new Hero got announced last week, Ashe, and she was added to the PTR on Monday so I have played about an hour of Overwatch while I try her out. She is quite fun, I think if I were compare her to the last Hero that came out, Wrecking Ball, then I would say WB is more fun but also feels a little harder to learn to play, while Ashe to me is easier but less wacky gameplay. I like the style of her and her omnic companion/ultimate ability B.O.B.
* **Abzu** \- This is a game made by some of the devs that made Journey and you can absolutely feel it. In this game, you're a person in a diving suit, swimming with fishes and making your way forwards. It has music reminiscent of Journey, it has scenes reminiscent of Journey and yeah, if you like Journey and want something that is a little more of the same, with perhaps slightly less of an emotional impact, then this game is pretty neat!
* **Bit.Trip Runner 2** \- I booted this up for literally maybe half an hour at most. This is a game where the character you play as constantly runs until the end of the level and then you have to navigate different obstacles by jumping, sliding, kicking etc. I had finished the first world of this game but went back to unlock some side stuff and that side stuff is haaaaaard. The game is fun, though, even when you are like me and have an urge to get 100% perfect scores on every single level (there are collectibles on each level and I compulsively have to get every. single. one. of them lol).

Huh, so I played more than I thought I had, although most of these games have gotten about 30 minutes of gameplay from me, apart from Regency Solitaire. This week I wish to get back to **The Book of Unwritten Tales 2**, which I am close to finishing, and **Dragon Age: Inquisition**, which I have gotten about halfway through (I think), and stop myself from booting up random games that I don't really care about completing.",1541694180,"i am currently playing the game on normal and towards the end the difficulty is ramping up quite a bit - one of my current goals is to get a streak of 22 which is insane, but most of these challenges can be brute forced by just replaying the puzzles over and over again and accruing more cards in your 'hand of cards' (i don;t know how else to describe them) that can be used to continue streaks.","insane, but most","insane","but",TRUE,"insane , but most","most",NA,NA,1

It can get WAAAAY more incoherent and insane. Let me tell you why I 'mindlessly' down voted most of your commments. You seem to think that the world is inherently better right now for some reason. You also seem to think that technology has not only changed the world dramatically but we are now exceeding smarter and more advanced and in turn live in a utopia. According to your first comment basically you think that there is virtually no crime, and the world is at peace. First off, that last statement has is more insane than the grammatically incorrect person you were trying to call insane, but we can get to that in a sec.

 I would first like to agree with you, while yes we have *learned* alot over the last century, and yes we now have the internet, which is basically a massive cesspool of information that anyone can excess at any time. Is this what makes us so *smart* and *advanced*?? How did we actually acquire all this information?? As HUMANS all we can do is disect, mutilate, rip apart and analyze our surroundings. We cannot create something from nothing and hence we can not create life, breathing, growing, natural life. But because we have ripped all these things apart and and looked at all the pieces that they are comprised of suddenly we are genius? No, we live and breathe and die like everyone else on the planet. We have to be given the tools first to create anything, which is exactly what we have done...

 Part two. The industrial revolution.... this was the start of our mechanical world we live in today. How can I build things better, faster, stronger, and hence belt line factories started producing things on a massive scale, consequently at the cost of individuality and a quality product (at least how the world looks now, maybe not so much back then.) But this is where we REALLY differ. What the internet has become is basically another reality, one that is computer generated, constantly edited, and has no depth to it. We have our real world personalities, and then we have our online **persona**  In a perfect cohesion of the two, one would have a balance of every day life and life online but we dont. We have people who literally are so sucked into the virtual world, obsessed about how everyone one else sees them or what everyone thinks about them, that we forget how to be ourselves. How to be genuine and sincere, how to have opinions even though others might disagree, and most importantly who we are, in the deepest crevice of our soul, who are we. Instead we let the world decide that for us, this virtual world that we have created is taking over the real world, the actual world. The one where this is no way to edit yourself, or edit what you say or delete things your not proud of. It the world where there are choices and there are real consequences for what we say and do. Everyone is so plugged into the world we have created that in actuality, they are disconnected from reality. This * virtual reality* we have created for ourselves is not only a distraction, but we have opened up a MASSIVE doorway, an accessible way for people with money and an incentive to basically program us. How do you know the information you are told is true? Unless you have gone out and done it yourself, how can you know its true? Anything can be bias, anything can be falsified, and with the capabilities of CGI, im afraid it won't be long before we wont be able to trust what we see, maybe we cant already.. 

This era has its advantages, but dont even begin to think that the world is so much better now, we are farther away from our creator than we have ever been. You know why? For the exact reason you p li intend out in a previous comment. We think we are so much smarter now, so much more advanced, I think our ego is WAAAY to big right now and the world needs to take a ride on the humility train real quick... can you bring forth rain, hail, lightning or any type of weather event, a small gust of wind perhaps? Do you make the seas roar or mountains tremble? Can you force the sun to refrain from coming up, or make the moon stay out for days on end? Can you tell a bear to stop in his tracks, or convince a lion not to eat you? 

What I'm trying to say here (if it isn't already blatantly obvious enough) is that for all the things that we have ripped apart, mutalated, and dissected, we are only getting a glimpse at the mechanics of this world, and the most hilarious thing to me is... *it was always there* long before humanity stuck its grimy fingers all over everything, the system, the patterns and the biology was always there. But we are on the surface of learning about how the biology of this world works and there are endless depths. One thing I can promise you, we will NEVER understand these things and never reach those depths. So instead we have turned to electronics, and robotics and basically all things artificial... AKA FAKE!!!! I new reality where nothing is real. Oh the ironyyy!! I hope you unplug before it's too late, or your life is not your own, and you are allowing other humans to think for you.

"e6lg0ip","Here is the problem:

Scenario:

The United States outlaws the N word. But now blacks can't say it either so an exception is made to protect culture. But who defines how black someone needs to be in order to say the word?

It can't be based upon looks as that would be objective. So a DNA test would be required to determine the eligibility to say a word. Now this poses a problem as well since genetics and weird and sometimes a quarter black person looks white while an eighth black person looks black. 

Now what about linguistics. In the bloods and crips gang rivalry crips wont use the letter b. So in words like bitch are citch and etc. So outlawing calling someone a bitch would have to include all the various of the word.

Ok, so my instinct would be to make the level of aberration escalate as you climb the tower, so first floor might resemble mindless zombies (no thinking happening, but physically more or less ok) and by the time you're near the top you're seeing gibbering mouthers made out of this wizard...

I would also probably ""stalk"" the players with something big and horrible that stays in the shadows until a big reveal and ends up being like 3 or 4 horrifying clones mushed together into one disgusting and angry conglomerate.

Lastly, while I like the trope that the original is an insane but otherwise identical clone, even I have to admit it's a tiny bit predictable. As a result, I'd try to give it a twist. Maybe he's NOT actually a clone, the wizard just wanted everyone to think he's dead for some reason. Maybe the reason there ARE other clones is that the clone who replaced the wizard just kept on cloning itself and made all these bad copies who then also tried to clone themselves... you know... Multiplicity style. Maybe there never was a wizard, just a fiend trying to use similar magic to be indistinguishable from a human and all these horrific monstrosities are the results. Whatever you decide, just take the predictable end and make it not quite what the players thought.

"e14mej7","Hi! I’m on keto to control my migraines!
I get aphasia (loss of words)too when my migraines are kicking in, it’s SO frustrating and would be super scary if I hadn’t had it for so long.

If I don’t balance my electrolytes, then my migraines start up.

I read [Fighting the Migraine Epidemic](https://www.amazon.com/Fighting-Migraine-Epidemic-Migraines-Medications-ebook/dp/B076BZG2V3/ref=mp_s_a_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1529697162&amp;sr=8-1&amp;pi=AC_SX236_SY340_QL65&amp;keywords=migraine+stanton) by Angela Stanton a few months ago when my migraines picked up significantly and was desperate for anything.

Her protocol she recommends is completely cutting out all sugars and sugar substitutes, and almost all carbs (close to keto, but I think she goes as high as 100g of carbs). She also is adamant about staying vigilant about hydration and electrolytes (standard sodium, magnesium, potassium). She wants you to take 1/8tsp (or equivalent salt tablet, but I just swallow salt instead of buying something else) with 8oz of water first thing in the morning, even before getting out of bed. Then, repeat a couple of times a day, and then again when you get into bed.

My first reaction reading her book was: she’s a quack OMG WTF. My second reaction was: but damn these migraines are gonna kill me and her recommendations are cheap and harmless since I don’t have other major health complications.

So, I’ve been doing this for 6 weeks and I’ve had 3 migraines try to start and been able to stop them all.

Her recommendations to stop a migraine in its tracks: taking 1/8tsp salt with 8oz water or Nu-Salt (salt + potassium) and 8oz of water. Sounds completely quack-ish and insane, but it’s worked so far for me.

But, IANAD and YMMV.

It helps me stay ON keto because I tell myself that my brain can’t cope with sugars so I don’t get sugars.

If my electrolytes are balanced, dairy isn’t too tough on me, but I’m cutting it out more and more because I feel much better without tons of dairy. And, there are a LOT of people who do dairy free keto and it’s not hard.

You can find dairy-free keto recipes on quite a few websites like [Healthful Pursuit](https://www.healthfulpursuit.com/recipe-search/).

Title: **Roommate assaulted me and got away with it**

Original Post: 

&gt; My roommate just tried strangling me because I was walking around the house without a shirt (he's religious and insane), but when I called the cops, he called them too and said I assaulted him first.
&gt; 
&gt; The cops told me that because it's a ""he said, she said"" scenario, the most likely outcome if I don't drop the charges is that both of us will end up with assault charges on our record, so I didn't file charges.
&gt; 
&gt; This guy is a vile, racist, ignorant, manipulative sneak, but the landlord likes him because he does a lot of landscaping for free. Any suggestions?

My wife and I were staying at a B&amp;B. It was early morning \- 4, 5 am, something like that. My wife had got up to go to the bathroom, and I was lying in bed only very slightly awake.

Suddenly I became aware of a presence in the hall outside our bedroom. I don't quite know how to describe it...it was like a fuzzy ball of nothing.

It moved into the bedroom and drifted around the bed. I lay there and couldn't move. It started to make its way up onto the bed. That's when my dog appeared on my chest.

My dog was a border collie/retriever cross, rather insane but extremely loyal. She wasn't with us on this trip, due to the aforementioned insanity. But I felt her on my chest, steady, calm, and watching the Presence and I felt a deep sense of safety and comfort.

I called your idea here evil and explained exactly why, because I think honesty is the only way to contribute to debate, and if my response upsets you to the point where it's counterproductive, then dancing around your delicate feelings can only indulge them and perpetuate the weakness that you need to overcome, until you can actually handle participating in a debate where people can say honest things, even if they are harsh.  I think your argument here is evil.  Grow the hell up and deal with that, and do me the courtesy of telling me when you think my ideas are evil, and explaining exactly why.

Furthermore, you're associating people calling things evil with shitty old religious bigotry of days gone by.  People would say ""that's evil"", but then either not explain, or else would claim it was evil because some magic ""god"" rule.  Which was pure bullshit.  And that is not what I did here AT ALL.  In fact I bothered to engage you because I think we actually share the same underlying values, such as wanting to promote equal opportunity for all people, but I think you are desperately confused about how that works, to the point where your proposals constitute a grave violation of other values I'm sure we both share.  And I summarize that as EVIL to get your attention about how profoundly serious I think this is.

&gt; *That is genetics, we can't control genetics yet.*

Does that mean when we can control genetics, you would make people uglier, stupider, and/or weaker, in order to prevent them from having unequal opportunities over those less fortunate?

I'm not conflating wealth with genetics, I'm comparing it, and saying it's just as evil as messing with genetics.

And exactly what is your justification for claiming you have the right to control wealth from being inherited?  You need to fully justify the proportionality of this claim, that the harm done to those you prevent from inheriting, would be somehow sufficiently offset by increasing the opportunity of others (merely crippling some in a futile attempt to create pure equal outcomes is not justifiable, you need real gains for the losers).  One way I could see doing that is to put a maximum limit on inheritance, say max $50M, which is at least such a high number that you can't stick the accusation of leaving the person excessively deprived, because that kind of money is the factual opposite of being deprived of anything.  But that limit still prevents the unearned billionaires who carry on family dynasties without actually earning the power through merit.

Bros need some advice. I’ve been cutting for almost a year now (March 17). Basically a re-comp from getting fat AF. Been sticking to only 1 cheat meal a week so I don’t go insane, but other than the holidays been pretty good about staying on track.

Anyway, I’m down to 19% from about 30, and wanna do Goomah’s summer shredding for shits and gigs and to push myself. (for those who don’t follow him, basically a 90-Day show cut)

Question is, should I continue cutting for the next 2 weeks when It starts, or give my body a break and eat at/slightly above maintenance? Plan on cutting out cheat meals and sticking to my macros over the 90-days so I’m worried I might go insane if i basically add 2 weeks Onto that.

Stats:

6’1, 175 (down from 220), 19% according to scale

Current macros:

1900 cal, 190 protein, 166 carb, 55 fat and plan on keeping around the same level through the cut.

"dujjav1","No, it's a controlled form of hyperventilation. There is an essential and marked difference. Hyperventilation is not voluntary, the lack of control over it is the issue. By training in the Wim Hof breathing, you take control over it, you learn to better control your breathing during stressful events as well, because you're focusing _on breathing_ every day for ~10 minutes a day.

You could actually use the Wim Hof breathing to help control your panic attacks, your breath controls a lot of your physiological state. If you take the cold shock reaction(deep sudden breath) you freeze, if you hold your breath through the reaction, you strengthen yourself against it and it becomes easier to handle. Not perfect, mind you, but easier. 

It has also been shown to allow you a measure of control over your immune system.

Okay, I have a problem with this. Drugs very much cause problems within society. People will become addicted, and those who are addicted will commit crimes, or become unable to work. I live in a town where meth is a serious problem and I have seen the effects of it myself.

What this conversation is about is whether prohibition helps the situation. It doesn't. So for you to come in here and say that this conversation is about drugs being okay and it doesn't hurt people is not only insane, but incredibly ignorant.

&gt;If you actually fucking care even slightly about making positive progress on this issue, you can start by asking yourself if callously letting our countrymen rot in prison for seeking happiness at their own expense is what strengthens the bonds between us.

I want to tell you a story. My cousin was a meth addict and so was my father. Both my cousin and my father were abused by their parents. My father, after his long span of drug use, finally got help at 40 years old. It cost him his career, it cost him his family, and it nearly costed him his life. My cousin, surprisingly enough, ended up worse. He doesn't have family and still does meth. The worst though was one of his outings with his truck, where he crashed after getting high and ended up with brain damage. The accident was so bad that the responded, who personally knew him and was a friend of the family, could not recognize him. He is able to talk, he can do basic things, hell, you might not be able to tell that he was missing chunks of his brain if you were to just watch him work.

I'm not a doctor, but I've had sleep terrors for about twenty years. It's basically a misfire in the brain that triggers a totally unnecessary fight-of-flight response, which is why your muscles are tensing up and your heart is racing.

Neither of these are serious, so don't panic! They're both pretty textbook sleep disorders. It would definitely be worthwhile to get a sleep test, just so you can rule out sleep seizures.

In the meantime (and I know this is easier said than done), try to get used to the idea that it's your brain misfiring and nothing more, in the same way that a migraine aura can feel hellish and insane but is neither of those things.

After you have any of these experiences, don't over-analyse, just say to yourself ""it's only my sleep disorder."" Believe it or not, that does help minimise fear in the long-run.

She might have been looking forward to making out and even having sex, but if the partner did something sexual she didnt give permission for then its just rape.  Once they close the bedroom doors no one else knows whats going on and if a ""no"" wasnt honored its straight up rape, although nearly impossible to prove. Its the most common kind of rape.  --just.. keep that in mind as a btw i guess. 

Thats ^just an aside. Its a serious problem that its hard to get evidence for these things and its super frustrating to see how it plays out.   Refusing a medical exam when offered sounds super weird to me but as an incredibly naive optimist Im gonna assume she had good reasons- and there are a number of reasons she would have... ""Testing for drugs of abuse or alcohol can be controversial as they may be used to discredit the patient"" (i mean not only 'victim blaming' but also like in theory what if she was hecked up on meth and didnt want somsone to know- even if the drug tests dont test for it she might not be emotionally sane to be reasonable and its no less rape) and also that after being raped and freaked out in ones own body (+ptsd kicking in), one isnt gonna be real comfy exposing ones genitals again for some strange doctor to poke around. In this case i think that especially stands as its undeniable sex happened with That man so DNA is pointless and the only question is the consentuality of it..... which is a fucking hard one to determine objectively..  .

"dlevslv","Not a fan or the USSR myself (hate communism myself), but I think the Nazis still square fairly worse than the Soviets (or the commies in general). The soviets invaded countries to ""liberate"" and occupy them. Those that die? Enemies of the revolution, or ""unfortunate"" price to pay, as sarcastic as the ""unfortunate"" may sound. Communism seeks to ""overthrow the ruling classes"" (in very general terms) and see violence as a means to that end. On the other hand, Nazis invaded countries to exterminate them (I'm not talking about the Western front, which was a distraction on a strategic level for the Nazis. I'm talking about the drive east, the whole Lebensraum thing and the plans detailed in Generalplan Ost). Those that die? Lower than human scum that were born with the wrong genes. The Commies, at least nominally, don't want to starve the entire population of a city because they may conquer them and add them to the worker's state. A burgeois that turns his back on his class and joins the revolution may be spared. A country that willingly seeks to join the Soviet state may do so. Even the Holodomor, horrible as it was, was done for pseudo pragmatic reasons (starve the Ukranians to feed the Russians) and because of personal failings (Stalin being an insane asshole) instead of ideological ones (""starve the Ukraine"" is not part of the Communist Manifesto). With the Nazis there's no such chance. Born Jewish? To the oven. Born slavic? Starve, or get shot. Maybe, if lucky, be left as one of the uneducated slave class the Germans were looking forward to have in their new russian lands. What, you're a German jew that's extremely nationalist and even a WWI veteran? Fuck you, born wrong, still to the oven. What, these settlements hate the soviets and even receive us as liberators from the bolsheviks? Sorry, born wrong, please line up orderly against the wall to get a free bullet. 

The crimes committed by the reds as they advanced through Europe were bestial and insane, but they were done with the hate of revenge, when you've just come from the brink of losing a war of extermination. They were also the very effective terror tactics a cruel army uses for strategic reasons once the gloves are off and you realize the ""rules of war"" were broken long ago. It's a concept of escalation that I once saw described very clearly: If you get into a fight with some other dude, you always have the chance just to poke his eyes out and win immediately. Why don't you do it? Because there's an unspoken rule that doesn't allow it, sure, but primarly because once you do then all bets are off: If you don't straight away win, if he dodges or something, now HE knows that going for your eyes is fair game, and it escalates from there. The Nazis, when opening the war against the Soviets, and while they were victorious, were absolutely bestial, seeking to exterminate the population, completely unlike their behaviour in the western front. Perfect example with Leningrad: They didn't circle the city to ensure a surrender; they did it to exterminate everyone living there so it would be easier to demolish the city afterwards, Hitler giving specific instructions not to accept capitulation. Sure, they were still monsters in the west, if there's an insurrection in France the SS may round up a small village and kill them all, but they didn't circle up Paris or Marseille with the express purpose of killing every living soul within. The Germans knew this as well, one of the reasons they were so desperate to hold the soviets back; not because they were ""barbarous asiatic hordes"" but because they were fueled entirely by hate and desperation, every bit of decency and compassion long since beaten out of them. Doesn't really excuse the crimes the reds did, but helps explain them and put them into perspective, especially when running a ""are nazis or soviets worse"" parallel.

He would literally do anything to prove he was the toughest goddamned marine in the history of life. Here are a few of his stories. Every single one of these is true with little, if any, embellishment. 


*Day 1 on the job:*

Super Mario walks up to me to introduce himself, and playfully says in his heavy Italian accent, ""You know, I'm the tough guy around here. You mess with me, you suffer."" Then runs his fucking head into a beam holding up the warehouse. Looks at me and goes, ""I told you. I'm tough. I'm a marine."" Then he gave me a pen and said, ""That's a marine's pen. Never suck up to me. I won't respect you."" It was within my first 2 hours on the job. I was so damned confused. 


*Punch me in the face!:*

During my tenure there I'd have multiple run ins with Super Mario. One day while I was printing new labels to redo all the labels in the FUCKING STORE - seriously, those things were paper and we had to not only find the labels but manually replace them. it sucks - Super Mario walks in and he is fucking happy. Apparently, his son was doing some sort of competition and won. Great! But he took so much pride in his son that he, again, wanted to prove how tough he was to validate his son's accomplishment. ""Normal_Punch, hit me in the face. Here. Right here. Watch. You can't hurt me."" with a heavy Italian accent. Obviously, I'm not going to punch my boss' boss. Right? Right. Anyway, he persists and I continue to refuse. After a few minutes he playfully insults me and HITS HIMSELF IN THE JAW. He stunned himself and had to sit down. When I tell you that he hit himself so hard he made himself dizzy, I am not at all exaggerating. 


*Drill to the arm:*

Super Mario was really good at his job. Very critical. Very focused. Very on point. Since it was a grocery store we often put together endcaps or other such display stuff. One day in particular after Halloween or Valentine's day. One of those candy holidays. We used old pallets to build a long display down one of our largest aisles before the store opened. Super Mario led the entire endeavor. Apparently, he got really fucking bored, and wanted to liven shit up. He was using a power drill to do something, I forget what. I walked away to get something from the back and my friend Jason comes in gasping for air. He grabs me and heads back to Super Mario, and asks him to show me how tough he is. Super Mario looks at me and my coworker and goes, ""Marines are fucking tough, baby!"" and takes the power drill to his fucking bicep. He's fully flexed during this entire thing just drilling into his shirt and arm. By the time he finished there was a minimum amount of blood but the shirt was fucking managed and his arm was a deep purple/blue from his previous attempt. I couldn't stop laughing.

At this point jokers body count is approaching the holocaust levels. It is morally and ethically correct to kill someone who has killed and is directly responsible for as many deaths as fucking Nazi SS Himmler and the reason for doing so is arguably worse, for the fun of it. You can take it on a case by case basis. In jokers case its pretty cut and dry. Yes he is insane but several million people dont deserve to die because he has a few screws loose plus the tens of millions/hundreds of millions/billions more before he is stopped. Do we just let joker kill the entire human race because its morally wrong to kill him? No you fucking stop him for good at some point. That point was 40 fucking years ago.

"diotnyj","I don't understand the ""in King's Fall a single death is a wipe"" meme.

* Totems

&gt; difficult to do but still doable (especially if you only need 2 more rounds or so). That being said, Totems is so easy that messing up here means you'll more than likely get stonewalled later anyways.

* Warpriest

&gt; Can do with 3. Losing people makes him stagger less and means he can fight back a bit which might up the danger. Again, the worst that should happen is the Brand Holder dies at 0 stacks left.

* Golgoroth

&gt; Can do it with 2 theoretically but in practice it's more like 3 (since someone has to help out with Taken Thrall down in the pit). Also makes the damage much less and therefore take more cycles. If you're doing Challenge, you can't lose anyone, sure, but Golgoroth Challenge is cut and dry if people play smart (i.e. dont stand in Golgoroth's LoS, watch the debuff)

* Daughters

&gt; Can do with 4. People on plates tend to be lazy and not help with adds. A single rocket in center from each person will clear the Acolytes and Centurions, and they should be in center before the second set spawns in. Damage could be an issue but there's Warlock Fusions and Tethers.

* Oryx

&gt; Can do with 4 if people are good, can do with 5 if people pay attention. Again, it comes down to people not wanting to help while on a plate. Grenade and Sleeper your Ogre, kill your across Knight and your across adds, and head back to center. But people on plates act like it's a hard job standing stationary hardscoped on a spawn point, and then die getting off the plate because Acolyte Eyes lock onto them and gun them down. Oryx chest may be a little issue but if everyone fires WoL-buffed primary and one person shoots a Sleeper, it's almost an instant stagger. You have slightly less time at Shade but it goes down immediately after first slam 90% of the time anyways so it's hardly an issue. At detonation, runner switches to ToM and just keeps constant fire on chest while everyone detonates. If down to 4, people on Oryx's side have to shoot his chest a bit while in their bombs but again, some focus fire and a Sleeper opens him up really quickly anyways. But 5-man Oryx is brain-dead easy and people meme it as hard because they're lazy.

Almost every other final Raid boss also has a par of two deaths (except Crota where it's like 3).

* Atheon

&gt; 1 death is fine, two outside. 2 is dicey but also fine (might have two wait for portal to open if he's on wrong side). 3 deaths is wipe (Lost in Time). 0 deaths for Challenge.

* Crota

&gt; Hell you could probably go down to 5 deaths and still complete it if your Swordbearer is a god and can solo-down 390 Crota twice and kill him without enraging. Otherwise, the two deaths are free since Oversoul doesn't come up on a player death anymore and 3 people can easily run through the motions (considering you have a Nighthawk for Oversoul), even if burning the Ogre (which you shouldn't have to do if your Swordbearer is competent and can get 6 WoL-boosted Slams plus a Super off on Crota) is dicey since he might be at like 1/3 HP when he aggros and get a kill before he dies.

* Aksis

&gt;Realisitically he can be 5 manned although it's kind of dicey (double cannon juggler, solo cannon, 3 solo throwers) and getting in position in time may be difficult. Left side is brain-dead easy to solo, plus you have one less person to be chosen for empowerment. 4 man is insane but also doable with the right group. (Double cannon, single cannon, double thrower, solo thrower). Sides again are pretty easy to solo since right side sniper shanks like to try to snipe middle and don't focus on you really. This time you have a great chance of everyone being in the right spot off the bat when empowerment shifts. 3 is psychotic but possibly doable if people know what they're doing, can cross-map their servitors, and scramble for their bombs (triple cannon, 2 double throwers). Your only respite is that empowerment is impossible to mess up.

**TLDR**
5 man Oryx is cakewalk if people aren't drooling idiots.",1497038551,"left side is brain-dead easy to solo, plus you have one less person to be chosen for empowerment. 4 man is insane but also doable with the right group.","insane but also","insane","but",FALSE,"insane but also doable","doable",NA,"also",1

$1 is a fairly safe estimation, however unless you've got a shitty viewer base or content, you're probably closer to $2. 

~~cpm is weird though and not set in concrete. Basically $1 is probably someone like your FFTV, the kind of 'questionable' content advertisers don't like. $2 is going to be your average single person gaming channel. $3+ is usually if you're in a decent network.

"da2dga7","Alright, let me teach you how the math department works around here, you'll need to know it.

Your test grades and quiz grades mean literally nothing. The thing that matters is what they are RELATIVE to the rest of the class. The way grades are distributed is crazy and insane but works so they don't change it.

Step 1: Take final

Step 2: Arrange all students in recitation according to their total grade in the class, including final grade. 

Step 3: Take grades on finals and distribute them across the class. If there were 10 A's on the final, then your recitation gets 10 A's for the course (which go to the top 10 ranked students, even if they didn't do as well on the final). If your class is 100% A's on the final, everyone gets an A in the class, even if you didn't do a single thing all semester. If everyone in the class fails the final after getting perfect grades all semester, everyone gets an F.

Typically, the top half of all students in MA161 gets A's and Bs, the next 25% gets a C, and the last 25% get some smattering of D's and Fs. It varies by the lead instructor's whims that year. For your purposes, you'll probably want to be a decent amount over the median of 161. Try and compare your recitation's average test grades with the overall lecture's average test grades to determine if your recitation will carry you to victory or drag you down to hell.

So really, there's no way to know how you'll do until you get your final grade, but you can attempt to compare yourself to find your rank in the class.",1479272423,"the way grades are distributed is crazy and insane but works so they don't change it.","crazy and insane","insane",NA,FALSE,"crazy and insane","crazy",NA,NA,0

"d8bhrud","Helmut Kohl.           
He was the most influencial German politician from 1982 to 1998. Chancelor for 16 years! Until he was caught in a donation scandal.        
Admitedly, he was the head of German politics in a time where everything came up roses anyways. That's not to say thing were easy. One of his mayor accomplishments was the reunion of East and West Germany.         
Sure, the Soviet Union could have collapsed under any other politician of the time, had he been chancellor. But Kohl speerheaded this unity, both in person and politicaly. As the first West German politician, he vaccationed in the DDR (East Germany). He also introduced, and pushed through, a 1:1 exchange rate from East to West German currency.            
That's like exchanging Rubel for Dollar. Economically insane, but favourable to our ""long lost cousins"".           
He then even got them covered under the protection of NATO in the 2-on-4-Accord.              
He then set the first steps with France to introduce the Euro.       
Yeah, that was his puppy. This thing that unites all of Europe now was a done deal between him and the French prime minister in the beginning.           
So, after 16 years in power, he literally gets caught with a black suitcase full of ""donation"" money. Where did it come from? Who was influencing German politicians?           
He never said.          
In an outrageous move, Kohl claimed he ""did not remember"" who he had done deals with. The accusation was that international arms dealers had supported his party, on the condition that they would be allowed to trade high quality German arms.            
He was never sentenced, as is ""customary"" with a lot of powerful men. It cost him his political career. But his legacy remains to this day.           
There is another point I'd like to make: People today, they look back at the olden days, and they see economic prosperity, sweeping, positive social changes, the visionary Kohl.           
This was not Kohl's doing, but people have this sentiment that, despite being crooked like a corkscrew, whatever he did ""just made things work"".              
On top of that, he had the balls to take on a commity that could jail him and give them the oldest ""fuck you"" in the playbook. ""I don't remember""? Really?           
And guess what. Guess who is protegee was. Guess who, after learning it all from him, surpassed her master?           
Angela Merkel.            
She's been quietly building her power since her mentor was thrown out, and today, who is the first female chancellor of Germany?          
Her. For 11 years running.

"d7okff9","I could just name Tetris, but where's the fun in that?

Have you considered space simulations? Games like Freespace, Freelancer, the Elite series, the X-series or the upcoming Star Citizen? Alternatively, there's the Aquanox series of underwater games, which play quite similarly. I'm very fond of the second game in the series (technically third, since Archimedean Dynasty came before the first Aquanox). FTL also doesn't have trees and is entirely set in space, so if you haven't played this incredibly hard, brilliant, perfect little game, give it a try first.

Going through my list of games on Steam, there are so many games I can name, so here they are, all of them (might take a while): Abstract endless game Race The Sun doesn't have any trees. Just gray shapes, which are so abstract that nobody can clearly tell what they are most of the time. Hotline Miamia is set entirely in interiors, so no arboreal nightmares there as well. The Chronicles of Riddick Assault on Dark Athena is a magnificent stealth game that's set in a dark sci-fi prison (on a desert planet) and a space station. I don't remember ever seeing even a decorative shrub in this outstanding game. I Am Alive is a very flawed, but interesting post-apocalyptic game, more focused on narration than typical survival mechanics. The game's gray, nothing green to see. One of those hidden gems. Orcs Must Die 1 &amp; 2 are action-heavy pseudo-tower defense games. Very frantic and enjoyable, highly polished and the only green things in them are Orks. Receiver is a short experimental game focusing on guns. Extremely interesting. Spec Ops the Line is a must-have game, a modern interpretation of The Heart of Darkness, one of the most impressive narrations of any game I've played. It's set in a decaying Dubai, so obviously no trees (IIRC). Groundbreaking narrative title Dear Esther (the first game to be called a walking simulator by people who always need to shoot stuff in games) also doesn't feature a single large brown thing with green stuff growing on it, because the island its set on is cold and barren, with just some meager bushes and grass covering the landscape. Speaking of bold narrative experiments without large brown things with green stuff growing on them, The Stanley Parable is almost entirely set in an office, which is naturally not a place for trees to grow. Trees also don't grow underwater, especially not on Alien planets, so have fun with excellent early access unter water survival and swimming the fuck away from *oh god what was that* simulator Subnautica. Alien planets don't need to be terrifying water worlds, they can also be covered in trash and populated by strange people, which is the setting of Daedelic's celebrated point and click adventure game series Deponia. As you can imagine, trees don't grow on trash (also the name of my new band). Machinarium on the other hand is set on a similar planet, this time entirely populated by robots and incredibly gorgeous. No trees, robots don't like those. Robots are a theme in the aptly named Choice of Robots, which is a text adventure. In Little Inferno, you are burning stuff (no trees IIRC), a strange game that slightly disappointed after the incredible, perfect and stunning World of Goo, which has lots of little goo creatures that can be used to solve puzzles - and some of them are green, goo monsters, not puzzles - but no arboreal thingies. AaAaAA!!! - A Reckless Disregard for Gravity (actual title) lets you jumps of things, for when you can't take this green planet anymore. You'll also get points for style and it's wonderfully weird and quirky. Audiosurf 1 and 2 are music-based games - just point them towards your directory of MP3s and they'll generate beautiful, abstract and entirely tree-free™ tracks. A ton of fun. Speaking of fun, I never imagined how much fun Cook, Serve, Delicious would be. It's a restaurant manager/cooking sim with just the right number of clever ideas, a charming presentation and gameplay that ranges from relaxing to frantic. People don't eat trees, so no trees to be seen (or eaten). Brilliant fun and the developer is a standup guy (got a Steam key after my Android version refused to work). 

*catching breath* Okay, a few more. Many more.

Pool Nation is a gorgeous and excellent pool game. Ignore the successor, ignore the F2P spinoff, ignore any other pool game, this is the one to have. Trees were harmed making tables and queues. Super Hexagon is yet another perfect little game. An intense electronic soundtrack, insane, but insanely fair difficulty and just the right balance of frustration and rewarding fun turn this title into one of my all time favorite games. Five minutes of this game are about as exhausting as three hours of any other title (or chopping down a you-know-what). Great mental workout. Surgeon Simulator. It's Youtuber-bait, but it's whacky fun. Since there are no trees, only people in it to ~~murder~~ operate on, and it being fairly cheap (and fun), I can recommend this for a cold evening in your summer home on a tree-free™ Peruvian high plateau. Gunpoint's setting is entirely urban, so nothing to fear. Fantastic little hacking/stealth game, the game Deus Ex always wanted to be, except it's 2D and your hero makes a lovely *splat* down when falling from a building. I love it just as much as you hate trees. In Thomas Was Alone, you are controlling Tetris pieces, yet somehow this game manages to tell a tree-free™, but touching storyline. A great Indie surprise hit. VVVVVV looks like a ZX-Spectrum game from back before trees were invented, but it's a great platformer/Metroidvania that doesn't have a jump button. Normally in a Metroidvania, you get further by the character gaining new equipment and skilly, but in this game, you get further by becoming better at playing it. Since it's bloody hard, this may take a while.

Halfway point. Hang in there.

Democracy 3. Slick UI, there might be a tree pictogram you can edit out. It's a politics simulator. Some people claim it's too hard and too complicated, I think it's too easy, so the truth is probably somewhere in the middle. Simulates politics with you deciding stuff. Fairly realistic, very accessible, teaches you a lot about how politics work. Frozen Synapse has a cyberpunk theme, so no trees, no Sir. Great turn-based tactics game, enjoyed it a lot. Universe Sandbox 1 &amp; Deux: What if the Moon was the size of the Earth? What if the Earth was the size of the Moon? What if I just lob them into each other and bring the entirety of *Andromeda* into play? Believe me, after a while there are no more green spots on mother Earth left, let alone an Earth to speak of. While we're at space, Red Faction Guerrilla is set on Mars, so it's again tree-free™, yet somehow people can still breathe there. Sorry for the pro-tree propaganda. Still the most impressive destruction engine of any game, just blow shit up and go home a happy ~~terrorist~~ freedom fighter. Abstract WTF-em-up Antichamber on the other hand will leave you happy (and tree-free™) as well, but also slightly to very confused. Non-euclidean spaces are the most harmless prank this puzzle game plays on you. Why not hack into something to get your mind of strange things? Uplink to the rescue, still one of my favorite Indie games with a smashing soundtrack and timeless gameplay. It's Hollywood-hacking, not realistic at all, which isn't a bad thing, because it's done so well in this title. If you're looking for something more realistic, less sandboxy and similarly focused on machines that don't grow on trees (nor have them growing in them), the Hacker Evolution series can help. Since you're basically programming in them, Human Resource Machine (aka first year of computer science simulator) shouldn't faze you. A thinking man's game, love it to bits (hehe). Osmos is eat or be eaten, with round orbs floating through tree-free™ ether. Still just as gorgeous as on the day it was released. 

Still got a few more. Fun fact: I recently killed a tree. A small one, but every little thing counts, right?

I actually managed to find a racing game without trees: Trackmania Nations. It's set in a stadium, hilariously unrealistic, entirely free without any IAPs and one of the best things that has ever happened to the racing game genre with possibly the largest selection of community-made tracks of any racing game. There's a successor that costs money, but only looks slightly better (but has massively higher hardware requirements) and doesn't add anything substantially new. Anachronox is an old and weird, but tree-free™ and interesting RPG. I love it's low-poly look, which has aged far better than most games from its era. System Shock and System Shock 2 area also old, have also aged well and are generally considered to be brilliant. Set on space stations and released only shortly after trees were invented, they lack the required technology to render them. Don't miss Bioshock's futuristic granddaddies! Tron 2.0 was heavily inspired by them and until Tron Legacy, it was the official continuation of the famous '80s movie with CGI elements. Great game by Monolith, who later made F.E.A.R., aka T.F.T.F.L.T.T.W.A.T.D. Since there are no trees on the grid, it gets the coveted tree-free™ seal of awesomeness. Nuclear Holocaust is fun, right? DEFCON certainly is, in a weird, eery thank fuck the Cold War is over kind of way. Definitely an experience.

&gt; For the 41 capital crimes that exist at a federal level there is not much of a chance for the person to be rehabilitated their actions have deemed them not capable of living in society safely.

I agree here in terms of rehabilitation and capability of reintegration, I just don't believe that they necessarily deserve this opportunity. They can live on in prison and possibly aim to spread a message of regret of their actions and enforce a positive image towards others from, perhaps, similar backgrounds susceptible to be driven to a similar path. I don't think freedom after their crimes is a desirable outcome, and serves as a harsher deterrent.

&gt; Life in prison isn't torture. Its not great but for some people thats a better option than being on the outside. 

This is sadly the case for many abused peoples and the homeless, though they mainly commit misdemeanours in order to get off the streets/away from family for a while. I think that social welfare needs drastic strides forward in order to prevent people from seeking prison as a better option that their live in society.

&gt; Death isn't the deterrent it's the punishment. You cant lump the two together or else you are going to get some mixed concepts thrown in. If that was the issue than you would have lawyers pleading insanity, but its a defense that rarely works because it is a hard thing to prove a person is that out of touch with reality. There are some people that are actually just bad people, not just insane, but willfully bad people.

Definitely agree, apologies for the horrendous wording I used. I believe that death is a deterrent for all, but not necessarily a punishment for all (martyrdom). You do get a lot of lawyers pleading insanity however, and some are genuine victims of insane mental conditions. Even if they are willfully bad, is it not a harsher punishment for them to live a restricted life filled with loneliness and boredom at the absolute least? 

&gt; But thats not how prisons work. You aren't just confined with people of similar crimes. Many of the lifers in prisons often do hits inside anyways. These criminals are people too and its a bit of cognitive dissonance to say that its okay to keep the dangerous criminals with those people because you know they are already criminals deserving less protection from crimes anyways.

Hmm, this is very true. The burden of proof isn't being laid on you here, but what do you view as an alternative? (I have to award a ∆ here, because I am truly stumped.)

&gt; Many of the innocent people that are convicted get let off and paid reparations, but you cant assume that tons and tons of these people are innocent. 4% is already pretty low and the burden of proof and evidence for these crimes are pretty high. Capital cases get the full weight of the legal system thrown at them, including far more appeals than most other cases ever get.

True, but it's still a harsh margin considering the amount of cases and the fact that innocent lives are concerned. And reparations will never make up for that time, I don't think. Even if the full legal system is used, the absence of some conclusive evidence that proves their innocence isn't covered by judicial realms unfortunately. (such as multiple eye-witnesses perhaps not coming forward, etc)

&gt; We aren't at war with criminals criminals are transgressing normative social an legal bounds within their own society. Wars are a totally different kettle of fish. Wars you can have multiple endgames crimes you only have one, restoring social order.

I can't agree with this, although you're correct that the bounds are completely different, if the serial killer puts himself in exile in another country and never kills again, social order is restored, but is it a justifiable outcome? What if it is a war criminal that has fled from custody? I think that although warzones and domestic crime are worlds apart, the two have to have be applied to similar rules due to both of these circumstances perhaps leading to possible death sentences.",1470180398,"there are some people that are actually just bad people, not just insane, but willfully bad people.","insane, but willfully","insane","but",TRUE,"just insane , but willfully bad","bad","just","willfully",1

3 hots and a cot, you can get married, you can have children, get a job, never have to pay rent. Life in prison isn't torture. Its not great but for some people thats a better option than being on the outside. I believe in a system of punishment, and then rehab. Punish the person, and then get it so that most people can adapt to society and get their act together. For the 41 capital crimes that exist at a federal level there is not much of a chance for the person to be rehabilitated their actions have deemed them not capable of living in society safely.  

&gt;For those who disregard imprisonment as a deterrent, I doubt they'd regard death as one either - but if they did, then isn't some possibility of the killer even realising the severity of some of his actions be enough justification for rehabilitation or guilt?

Death isn't the deterrent it's the punishment. You cant lump the two together or else you are going to get some mixed concepts thrown in.  If that was the issue than you would have lawyers pleading insanity, but its a defense that rarely works because it is a hard thing to prove a person is that out of touch with reality. There are some people that are actually just bad people, not just insane, but willfully bad people.

&gt;They can't be a threat in confinement either. Maybe to other inmates with the same nature of crime, but they are segregated from society permanently anyway. My issue here is evidence unreliability and the prevention of rehabilitation as well as realisation.

But thats not how prisons work. You aren't just confined with people of similar crimes. Many of the lifers in prisons often do hits inside anyways.

&gt;I agree that he cannot be martyred if his body is gone, but his cause still resonates, no? ISIL, Taliban, Boko Haram may not have been directly influenced, but if death doesn't prevent their crimes, then you should surely kill them in a warzone if you can't capture them. You at least minimise civilian death.

Well let's not compare warzone deaths to the populace, I mean Wahhabism and Salafism (The religious views driving the current Islamist views) are ideas that date back to the 1740s and the extreme nature of Jihad can be seen since the move from Mecca to Medina in Islamic tradition. SO it's hard to compare the two things.  Best you could compare would be people like serial killers or celebrity court cases in the Legal system. Its just not a good comparison, rather than comparing apples to oranges; its comparing apples to AK-47's.

They're just two more broken people in the ruins of the world. That's the beauty of the fallout series- it shows humanity. Not an idealistic falsehood, and not a brutal vision, but something in-between. The raiders are driven to evil because of desperation, and insanity because of drugs. The average citizen doesn't care about ancient technology or what not, only about having food and clean water and a bed to sleep in. The various factions want to bring order to a chaotic place, and it's ultimately the player's choice who wins, and which ideology succeeds.

That is why I loved New Vegas the best- the factions were so *human*. House is an old man trying to preserve the spirit of his home through any means necessary, the NCR is trying to spread their prosperity and order to New Vegas, the Legion seeks to dominate the area for new slaves and resources, and an independent Vegas is ultimately ruled by the player for better or for worse.

"d5ev9ce","Some people need the comfort of insane but desirable promises to help them cope with a world filled with real pain they'd rather forget.  It's interesting to spend some time understanding the adherents of a certain faith by analyzing what kind of ""perfect reward"" is promised to the faithful.  In that light, this is a pretty disconcerting read... 

https://wikiislam.net/wiki/72_Virgins

If I may be allowed to paraphrase the Islamic texts summarized above:  If you're a guy, you get an eternal fuckfest with 72 obedient, worshipful, virgin wives with big tits (yes, that's in there) that you can expect to fuck at will forever because they are all perpetually available and your penis is never flaccid (yes that's also in there).  Surprisingly, all 72 remain perpetually sexually compliant even though their hymens grow back every time you break them so they are always virgins for eternity, and they never get to enjoy adult, non-virginal intercourse.   

So you might be wondering...if I'm an Islamic woman, and I get to heaven, does this mean I become one of a harem of sex slaves who has to endure the pain of hymen tearing for every sexual experience for the rest of my life, and I just have to appreciate that I get this opportunity whenever the dude I'm there to reward manages to plow his way through the other 71 just like me?  Not much of a fantasy, there.   

But that's not how it is.  Apparently, according to common clerical interpretation, Islamic heaven is entirely different for women.  Rather than a counterpart fantasy where life is a constant, heavily staffed fuckfest for their pleasure, faithful women are promised this reward package: **They get one husband and they will fucking like it.**  Seriously, that's it.

This makes me wonder, then...if the faithful women of Islam don't become one of 72 virgins in heaven...who are the women that are staffing the virgin fantasy for men?  If they aren't the faithful, they must be the infidels.  *The most attractive and glorious promise Islam can offer it's faithful is apparently an eternity of punishing sinners with their penis!  Basically, rape endorsed for (and by) eternity.*  WTF?!?   Does that also mean that hell for the male infidels involves being married to a single Muslim woman, in an existence that is good enough to serve as Heaven for her?  

What kind of person, man or woman, does this model appeal to?

I would put Islam in the criminally insane category. 

&gt; As for the the second one, https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2014/09/12/quebec_doctor_who_killed_his_kids_granted_bail.html So it seems to me that even doctors are capable of having questionable moral views.

Criminal insanity. He suffered from depression. 

But that doesn't matter for the point. People can do bad things and know that they are bad. We'd have to ask that doctor if he understood that what he did was evil, and at the moment, I can't speak to his intentions or state of mind given the article. 

&gt; You've done nothing to advance your view in my opinion especially since you said yourself, ""There will always be outliers, such as the criminally insane, but other than moral relativists, the cases above stand."" Yet you are arguing to allow even these very people to object to medical procedures on moral grounds. 

That is an excellent objection on your part, and I very well understand why you'd bring that up. 

We don't need to put all actions into binary bins of good &amp; evil. We can perfectly well allow for many actions to be more fluid along a spectrum. That's not to say that we're being relativistic, but it is to say that the nature of some actions isn't necessarily a moral issue, or that the morality of an action may be ambiguous for one reason or another. 

The major reason for that moral ambiguity is found in competing moral principles. Specifically in this case:

* Suicide and assisting suicide, vs.
* Comforting or reducing the pain of others

As you stated above:

&gt;  Yet you are arguing to allow even these very people to object to medical procedures on moral grounds. 

Yes. Because we have conflicting moral issues here. The doctors in the article have a clear priority in which moral principle they believe should take precedence. 

&gt; IMHO It's completely reasonable for us, as a society, to say that if you want to be a doctor (something we require a license for) you must be willing to provide any procedure that is legal. 

We'll just have to agree to disagree there. I don't believe that I have any right whatsoever to force you to do anything that you find immoral, and I don't believe that collectively we have that right. e.g. My right to do so is zero (0), and 0+0+0+0+0+... is still zero. 

&gt; There's nothing unusual about this at all unless your you're a libertarian (anarchist.)

I side with voluntary action and against coercion/initiatory force.

&gt; Should an individual doctor be allowed to refuse to give vaccines on moral grounds? 

Yes. 

&gt; What if this is also the only available doctor for people in a remote community and there's no practical alternative? 

Then that would suck. 

&gt; Morally speaking which is worse, to allow a large group of people to be at risk of deadly or debilitating diseases or to legally require a doctor to act in the patient's interest.

It is worse to force people to be immoral. Morality can only come from free choice. e.g. If you rescue someone from a burning vehicle, that is morally praiseworthy because you did it of your own free will. If you kill someone (or commit some crime/immoral act) because another person coerced you somehow, you are not morally culpable (I'm sure you can imagine numerous scenarios - they're in the movies all the time). 

&gt;  Keep in mind, the doctor is always free to stop being a doctor if they really are unable to reconcile their personal moral views with their legal obligations.

And forcing the doctor to not help anyone at all is worse than allowing the doctor to help people with that 1 exception. That ""legal obligation"" creates a net loss. 

&gt; I stand by my original statement as there is not and has never been universal agreement on what is right and wrong or even on how to determine what is right or wrong.

I won't argue against that. 

&gt; One of the benefits of group decisions is that it has a tendency to curtail the extremes and although far from perfect, it seems to me a better situation to require a few people to do something they don't like when compared to the unworkable chaos of having individual doctors decide that they morally object to some medical procedure.

I think you're exaggerating the case here -- there's no ""unworkable chaos"" with doctors limiting the number of services they provide. 

By the same token, we could create a law that all mobile ice cream vendors (Dickie Dee and the like) must also have extensive medical training, e.g. CPR and whatever. However, that would effectively eliminate mobile ice cream vendors, which wouldn't be good at all on hot summer days. 

Now, that example is rather absurd, but the underlying principle is the same -- forcing someone that provides a service X to also provide a service Y. 

To be clear...

&gt; Should an individual doctor be allowed to refuse to ~~give vaccines~~ **provide an arbitrary service** on moral grounds? 

**Yes - because initiatory force and coercion are too great of a moral hazard to allow.** 

But, I do understand your position, and I do understand why many people adopt that position. We're simply not going to agree on this issue because I put a higher value on the moral principle of the non-aggression principle (non-initiation of force/coercion/violence) than you do.

"d4ezd37","""If it were a matter of bourgeois ladies voting, the capitalist state could expect nothing but effective support for the reaction. Most of those bourgeois women who act like lionesses in the struggle against “male prerogatives” would trot like docile lambs in the camp of conservative and clerical reaction if they had suffrage. Indeed, they would certainly be a good deal more reactionary than the male part of their class. Aside from the few who have jobs or professions, the women of the bourgeoisie do not take part in social production. They are nothing but co-consumers of the surplus value their men extort from the proletariat. They are parasites of the parasites of the social body. And consumers are usually even more rabid and cruel in defending their “right” to a parasite’s life than the direct agents of class rule and exploitation. The history of all great revolutionary struggles confirms this in a horrible way. Take the great French Revolution. After the fall of the Jacobins, when Robespierre was driven in chains to the place of execution the naked whores of the victory-drunk bourgeoisie danced in the streets, danced a shameless dance of joy around the fallen hero of the Revolution. And in 1871, in Paris, when the heroic workers’ Commune was defeated by machine guns, the raving bourgeois females surpassed even their bestial men in their bloody revenge against the suppressed proletariat. The women of the property-owning classes will always fanatically defend the exploitation and enslavement of the working people by which they indirectly receive the means for their socially useless existence.

Economically and socially, the women of the exploiting classes are not an independent segment of the population.. Their only social function is to be tools of the natural propagation of the ruling classes. By contrast, the women of the proletariat are economically independent. They are productive for society like the men. By this I do not mean their bringing up children or their housework which helps men support their families on scanty wages. This kind of work is not productive in the sense of the present capitalist economy no matter how enormous an achievement the sacrifices and energy spent, the thousand little efforts add up to. This is but the private affair of the worker, his happiness and blessing, and for this reason nonexistent for our present society. As long as capitalism and the wage system rule, only that kind of work is considered productive which produces surplus value, which creates capitalist profit. From this point of view, the music-hall dancer whose legs sweep profit into her employer’s pocket is a productive worker, whereas all the toil of the proletarian women and mothers in the four walls of their homes is considered unproductive. This sounds brutal and insane, but corresponds exactly to the brutality and insanity of our present capitalist economy.

"d2uke7m","This was asked a while back, so I just copied my response again. The brains of the Think Tank: before the war, they worked with holograms, sonic frequency, genetic manipulation, cybernetics, stealth tech, weather control, auto-docs, toxins (Sierra Madre red toxin), lobotomites, and a metal known as Saturnite. Most of these innovations were tested on Chinese-American prisoners in the Little Yangtze concentration camp (think Nazi experiments on humans). Other experiments were tested over entire pre war communities, i.e. Sierra Madre Casino and Hopeville (The Divide). The ""bad guy"" is actually revealed to be insane, but ethical. He saw that the outside world would be at the mercy of Big Mountain, and thus gave the Think Tank a reason to stay there by making them scared of him. If I remember correctly, Mobius (the supposed bad guy) kept rewiring the Think Tanks way of thinking. When they got close to remembering life outside of Big Mountain, he made them forget (anyone correct me if i'm wrong). Also, as a precaution, he added pylons that would shut the brains down if they ever tried to escape Big Mountain. Anyways, when Elijah and Ulysses came to Big M, Elijah learned about the tech there and fashioned himself an improved Tesla Cannon, LAER, and a Holorifle. He worked on making the collars of Little Yangtze prisoners work (they were still alive after all this time due to ghoulification). This is how he TRIES to gets people to cooperate at the Sierra Madre Villa. At the same time, Christine is on a mission to hunt down Elijah and kill him (as they are ex-BoS), because Elijah was the predecessor of Elder McNamara (current leader of the BoS at Hidden Valley), and he left the BoS to die at Helios One during the NCR attack on them. She ends up getting caught, as Elijah sees her and sends robots to capture her. She is almost turned into a lobotomite. Ulysses saves her, but she suffers damage to her brain and voice box, due to the experiments done on her. Ulysses found Big M by way of trails that led from Big M to The Divide. Ulysses takes care for her back in his camp at ""Ulysses Point."" They discuss things. Christine: her mission. Ulysses: his philosophy. At some point they separate, but not before Christine gives a recorder to Ulysses, as a way of repaying her debt to him. That's how Ulysses has logs scattered all over Hopeville/The Divide. Elijah met the Think Tank, and asked questions they themselves started to wonder about. He ended up attacking 0 and 8, which ended up making 8's voice module malfunction (that's why the Think Tank now has a pacification field when you enter it). Elijah and Ulysses end up crossing paths, and so Ulysses points Elijah towards the Sierra Madre. Ulysses finally meets the brains at the Think Tank and asks them ""Who are you, that do not know your history?"" That set them off, as they remembered ""America, the Old World."" Elijah escaped by smashing trains into each other. Christine soon followed. Ulysses also escaped, and returned to the Mojave Express, only to see your name on the list of the 7 Couriers that were to deliver things to Mr. House. I am assuming you know the story behind The Divide. If not, long story short: Ulysses hates your guts for creating what once was Hopeville (now known as part of The Divide), and then INDIRECTLY destroying it. He grew to love the community, as it were. He saw a part of pre war America that was not the corrupt NCR nor the tyrannical Legion. And all of this, ended up tying together Dead Money, somewhat Honest Hearts (Ulysses is softly mentioned by Joshua Graham), Old World Blues, and Lonesome Road. Anyway, that was enough for the Think Tank to make them send a satellite to check the outside world, and thus, you are teleported to the Think Tank. So in the end, Elijah went to the Sierra Madre in search of new technology that would bring the NCR to its knees, with Christine following him, and Ulysses eventually returned to The Divide to make his ultimate plan. As for the Think Tank, that is only known by the Courier.

"cxe0kqc","*Sorry, this is long*...Well, for me, I loved the 9th and 10th Doctor's and their episodes because you could connect with both. I still wish that Eccleston had done more than one season and, though I was sad to see him go, I was content with the end of Tennant's run. Honestly, that's what I believe made them good Doctor's in the end. Now, I did like the 11th Doctor, he was more energetic which made his serious scenes that much more powerful in a way. Sort of like if a quiet person suddenly starting shouting at someone. 

The only part about Doctor Who I was ""meh"" on or ""hated"" was how the companions were handled, especially Doctor/Rose/Mickey/Martha. I mean, understand Rose was the first companion for the 9th and 10th Doctor's, but ultimately the idea that he could develop romantic feelings for a *human* when there is literally hundreds of years between the two is kind of crossing a line. I believe it would've been more powerful of an ending for Rose if she'd been like a best friend for the Doctor, like Sarah Jane. When I saw Sarah Jane for the first time, which was in ""School Reunion"", I was immediately a fan because of her interaction with the Doctor (and that was just one episode). When she returned at the end of the 4th Season, I was glad to see her and when she died, I was sad to see her go. When Rose was gone, I was glad to see it. When she returned, I was a bit peeved (but that's mostly because she ripped apart time just to see the Doctor again, which was not just insane but idiotic). 

Then there's Mickey, who was Rose's boyfriend and someone she'd known long before she met the Doctor, but completely ignored him in favor of someone she could never *truly* be with. She was completely rude to him, especially when he wanted to join them on their travels, for no other reason than she just wanted to be left alone with the Doctor. Then, when Mickey wanted to leave, she got upset. You can't be rude to someone and then expect them to stick around, unless they have that sort of mentality. The Doctor was rude to him as well, which made me shake my head in shame for him.

Moving on, there was Martha, who I felt could've been a greater companion if they hadn't focused on the Doctor giving her so much grief over not being Rose at the beginning of her run. Also, what was the purpose of her having a crush on him? For me, it seemed like another reason to compare her to Rose. The Doctor's grieving over Rose and now here's a companion who has a crush on him but will see nothing come from it because of said grief.

"cwo8lu1","The gamepad is useable with everything. For other controllers, consult Google first depending on the game. 

*Bayonetta + Bayonetta 2 (Do you like action games? Do you like Devil May Cry? You NEED to get these, Bayonetta 1 is at its best on Wii U and Bayonetta 2 is an exclusive AND they come together!)

*Hyrule Warriors [Dynasty Warriors + Zelda, HUGE amounts of content, if you don't know anything about Musou games you're basically a powerful leader unit (Zelda, Link, Impa, Wizzrobe and other well known characters) that smashes around hordes of bad guy soldiers and duels with enemy ""officers"" (other important characters) look up musou games and if you think they're your thing, definitely get this]

*The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker HD (If you've never played the original this is worth the investment, the Wind Waker is an amazing iteration in the Legend of Zelda series that has you exploring the great ocean, a new concept that I think was executed very well)

*Mario Kart 8 (Best Mario Kart to date, has the best example of DLC in recent memory, only 1 criticism and that is that the battle mode is sort of meh, it's basically just regular stages with the battle element, there are no ""arenas"", however this is a phenomenal game that over 50% of Wii U owners have, the online is robust and very active, can't recommend it enough really)

*Pikmin 3 (The best RTS series off of PC gaming, nuff said if you don't know about Pikmin, look into the first two!)

*Splatoon (One of the games of the year. This game is fantastic, it's a competitive shooter but if you're not the competitive type don't feel too worried, it's a blast for more casual players and highly skilled ones. You don't need to worry if your aim isn't so good because you can bring value to your team just by painting the stage! I cannot recommend this game enough, it's so unique and there aren't really other games like it at the moment)

*Super Mario Maker (Amazing concept, very vibrant community. I will say that there are many levels that are painful to play because of how easy it is to upload them but don't be discouraged! The game allows you to skip them when doing the random-level 100 Mario Mode and you never have to complete a level that is painful, if you're the creative type this game has all kinds of ways of flexing that and its getting updates to its content going forward)

*Super Smash Bros. (Nintendo's take on fighting games, well established, very controversial at times. There's not much I can say, if you're not familiar with Smash this is a great way to get into it, best with other friends but has online play)

*The Wonderful 101 (Underrated game, it's challenging to break into because of the control method, but if you want an action-packed beat em' up style game that makes terrific use of the gamepad and is completely unique in execution you owe it to yourself to try it out)
https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbCOGQCF6GO0HsY1zfxStGA1Ou-7Fj6AN


*Yoshi's Woolly World (Stunning game, it's the true sequel to Yoshi's Island that people have wanted for a long time, aesthetics are great, collectables are well incorporated and the challenge is perfect and customizable)

*Art of Balance (Digital only, very simple puzzle game but I find it relaxing)

*Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze (Amazing game, if you have ever liked a Donkey Kong Country game, you have to get this, some of the best platforming experiences in years)

*New Super Mario Bros. U + New Super Luigi U (Best NSMB game, builds on the formula, very polished)

*Affordable Space Adventures (Digital only, great indie shooter style game that makes great use of the gamepad)

*Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker (You will get a taste of this game in Super Mario 3D world, the Captain Toad levels are the format for this game)

*Kirby and the Rainbow Curse (A more laid back title, nothing insane but very charming and the style of gameplay is very unique)

*NES Remix Pack (Big collection of NES games with new ""challenges"")

*Pushmo World (Fantastic puzzle game, look up Pushmo in general to learn how it works more properly)

*Fatal Frame: Oracle of the Sodden Raven (A great addition to a Japanese horror series, digital only in North America very sadly and limited physical release in Europe that likely can't be secured anymore)

*Shovel Knight (Physical version, probably the best example of a new game that successfully emulates classic NES gameplay)

"cw4iqu6","&gt; Kid Buu

Everywhere I looked, including Japanese sites/comments, it says that Gohan-Buu was the most powerful and Kid Buu was less powerful.  Because Kid Buu is more uninhibited and insane, that's what makes him more dangerous.

But that's not I remember from watching the anime, so I checked the primary sources.  

Here's the Japanese [manga](http://comic.dragonballcn.com/list/gain_1.php?fpp=10&amp;did=0-0-33&amp;fid=69), where in the bottom-left panel, Kibito-Kai says (referring to Kid Buu initially absorbing the South and Great/Fat Kaioshins), ""吸収によってパワーを減らしてまで手に入れた心がまたもとにもどってしまった.""  My translation: ""[Buu's] personality that was attained through absorbing and decreasing his power has gone back to the original.""

I couldn't find official English translations of the manga to compare.  Maybe others can find them.  

In the anime, episode 277 ""End of Earth"" around the 11-minute mark, in Japanese, Kibito-Kai says the exact words from the manga as above.  The English subs (I don't know where these subs come from) says, ""His heart, which through absorption had allowed his power to even be reduced, has returned back to its original form.""  The Funimation dub says, ""This Buu's even more powerful.  And without the influence of the Kai's goodness inside of him, he's evil.""

So there's good reason for the confusion.  From the fighting it's hard to tell, but from some of Kid Buu's actions and from the way Kibito-Kai describes him subsequently as ""pure evil"" and such, it seems like Kid Buu's main danger does come from being pure and insane.  But all the primary sources I've found do show Kibito-Kai definitely saying that Kid Buu was the most powerful form and that the initial absorptions made him weaker (not just less evil).  Do a lot of people consider Kibito-Kai unreliable here?

"cvxzxpe","&gt;Ok, so you agree that the complaint about it makinIg the game cost more is irrelevant, asinine, and pointless. 

I have no idea what you are talking about now.

&gt;You cannot make every card be played. If you did, the metagame would be even more stale, as there would be literally no other cards to experiment and test with. You need cards that aren't actively being played so that there is some possible group of cards to experiment with and make new decks with. The fact that this particular metagame is shit, or even if you want to make the argument that hearthstone is shit, is irrelevant to this. It is a paradigm that is true across all card games.

You can make every card be played. I think you do not understand what it means that card is bad. Card that do not see play right now =/= bad card.

&gt;They saw no play in top tier decks, which is your metric for a good card apparently, so they were bad cards, and by your own logic, needed to be buffed to be good design. Obviously this notion is wrong and insane, but is the notion you have to take to keep your argument internally consistent. 

This is not my metric. First Warsong saw play in top tier/tournaments during giant warrior era. Looks like you lack of knowledge. Another point you do not understand what combo cards are. They are designed to be played with other cards. There is reason why berserker was not played, but find it yourself.

&gt;The game costs money. If that price is too much for you, don't pay. If its too much for the community, they'll stop. However, the monetization of the game has zero effect on whether or not the game is well designed. If I sold someone a $10000 chess set, it would have zero bearing on if chess is a good game.

Of course it has, how you cannot see such simple thing is beyond me. You obviously lack knowledge of how such business works, how addictions work and other impulses. Kinder Surprise example did really nothing? 

&gt;The purpose of blatantly bad cards, War Golem, other basic cards, ect, is to give the game a sense of discovery and advancement as you acquire new cards. Its not really a strict game design choice on the high level play, cards like this are irrelevant to high level play, but it is to build an experience to draw new players in and make the game good for them. If you want to say this doesn't work, I am just going to point to the statistics of the game rather than any particular argument on the logic of it. Good experiences are by definition irrational and vary person to person, so logically justifying them is pointless. Clearly blizzard made a game that works well to draw people in, and War Golem and friends are doing their part in it.

No, main purpose is to make you spend money, because if your friend will play Dr.Doom against you and you have pity War Golem you will feel like shit. So next time you will spend money to buy Dr. Doom to not be worse than your friend.

""Clearly blizzard made a CASINO that works well to draw people in, and War Golem and friends are doing their part in it.""

It is hard not to agree on this part, it is really well done addiction game that works on some people brains and eat their money like popcorn. Some people have weak minds and they are easy prey to corporations that spend tons of money on study the addiction methods, question is should they be protected.

And in one month it had 24 homicides. 

I fairly certain you could combine all of Scandinavia more than 20 million people and not even get close to that sort of statistic... 

And even it's not somewhere you ""accidently"" go why would you even risk living near it. Crime doesn't care about dome arbitrary line. You mean you don't get mugged outside that area? He is talking seeing a cop everyday, he is astounded he hasn't seen a cop in 30 minutes. 

I see police officer outside his car about once a year. And usually because I have to go to the police station for something....

You can try to normalize it all you want, but to someone from Scandinavia, your country seems excessively violent. 

In Norway they have 3 fatal killing by the police in 2 decades. Even the terrorist who shot all those kids on the island got caught alive..  

No matter how much you downplay it, to us, it looks like you have accepted an insane level of crime and violence.

Don't you even see, it's not Scandinavia living in some far fetched paradise. 

We are considering our own level of crime as extremely serious and are desperately trying to diminish it. 

When we hear about the USA it's hard not to think you haven't just given up.

10, 15 years ago there was a story about a danish turist that got arrested/reprimanded I don't remember which for leaving her baby carriage outside a shop while she went in for a quick purchase. 

This was totally usual here in Scandinavia at the time, and a lot of people are concerned that people have sort of stopped doing that. Are current crime statistics are scaring us from doing that know...if I lived in a major city in the US I would fear leaving the apartment. 

I understand that you can compartmentalize it, and reason it to be a slight risk to you. 

But to us it seems completely out of proportion. That so much trouble can exist between people. How does anything function? 

I realize life goes on, but when something bad does happen here, everybody knows about it. Everybody discusses the fear they felt, it hangs on for years. 

I just checked for the Danish stats to accumulate to the level of the 3 million people area of LA mentioned in the like, (and thats for homicides) we need to pool almost 5 years of case work. 

That's for a month of crime, in an city area with half the population of Denmark. 

And I think Denmark, pr capita, is the most criminal Scandinavian country...

Can you not see, to us, it's just too crazy?

* Erikson is an anthropologist/archaeologist, so the background cultures are fleshed out to an insane degree; races and cities aren't just stage-props, they're whole histories unto themselves, and any one of them would be worthy of its own epic. 
* The emotional engagement. Poignant doesn't begin to describe it - reading his books is like being beaten bloody with a sack of Latvian jokes. He will bring you to your knees with tragedy, then throw insane black comedy out out out of fucking *nowhere* leaving you deranged with slightly hysterical laughter, swing round and kick you in the head with tragedy while you're incapacitated, then drop a hundred-pound social-commentary rock on your back while you're down. Fuck.
* Even the goddamn *chapter-heading quotes* have the stopping-power of a cupboard door to the eyebrow. 
* The size/scope/density. It's like Game of Thrones *squared*, played not between piddling little kinglets, but between empires, gods, elder gods, ancient races and stuff it would take too long to explain. 
* The intensity of the prose. To quote Erikson himself:

&gt; A couple years back it occurred to me that I never really learned how to write a novel: I learned how to write short stories, and when I set to writing a novel I simply scaled up. So you can consider the ten book series as the longest short story ever written. I approached every line as if under the burden of carrying as much information as it could withstand, balanced against the elegance, rhythm, word-choice, of the sentence itself. Just like in a short story. It's no wonder the books do well as re-reads, because let's face it, who reads a novel as if it was short story? The text is packed. It's bursting at the seams.

"crav7yq","&gt; Yes, but fundamentally all range voting will devolve into effectively this.

Even if this is true, approval voting is still vastly better than any other single-winner system.

&gt;clearly moronic system

Strategy-proof, Perfectly proportional, preserves localism. It checks 3 boxes where no other system can check 2. There's nothing wrong with random ballot.

&gt;I dislike the idea of comparing voting systems based purely on which criterion they do or do not ""pass"".

Sure, but I think the one where voting for a candidate helps them, and voting against the candidate hurts them is pretty fundamental to the entire idea of voting.

&gt;So does basically every system out there apart from FPTP.

Yes, which was counter to your point that range voting pushes out third parties like FPTP.

&gt;This stage needs to be done by the actual people, because otherwise the trust hasn't yet been established.

I would assume you are entrusting more by trying put a candidate in power, than you are allowing them to transfer a vote share insufficient to put them in power. If you can trust a candidate with the power of a seat, you can trust them with the power of a fraction of a seat.

Your idea that people would vote for someone they trust with neither is insane but unrelated.

&gt; And anyway, what's the spoilt ballot rate with range voting? We have no way to know, because it's never been tested in any serious way in the real world.

Those studies earlier found that voters that have never been exposed to range voting before only had a spoilt ballot rate of 0.5-1% or 0.026% if allow for partial spoilt ballots using abstains.

The Irish STV also has a 5.2% spoilt ballot rate, so it's on them too, and an independent study found that it's 7.0% for any rank-order-ballot for newly exposed voters.

I mean you could use a range voting ballot for STV if only to reduce vote spoilage (though you'd have to use an STV variation that allows for co-equal ranking).

&gt;Then why your own comment earlier that STV only works if we ""pretend"" voters are honest? 

Voters are honest, but when voting for your favourite can hurt their chances, they're not playing an honest game. If [showing up vote can hurt you chances](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Participation_criterion), no voting counts as a strategic vote. The system is stacked against the honest voter, they have work to be honest, range voter just need not exaggerate their preferences.

[Sure thing.](https://youtu.be/Rh1hoNwFfg8)

&gt; Sure, you can have others influence you or you can listen to what others have to say (everyone should do that!), but conforming yourself just to ""fit in"" is rather unhealthy. It not only goes against your own sense of self-worth -- by demeaning who you are as a person -- but also makes it seem as if what you are doing is ""wrong"".

Sounds like personal experience :P

&gt; ""treat others as you would want to be treated""

Yeah, this is where I wasn't impressed by the depiction of the Invisible Storm, because it was treated as ""irredeemable evil"" for the purpose of the themes. Now if we see it through the lens of the characters, I'm all for that, but for the show to hammer the idea that groups=sheeple=evil, and that just grates me. 

&gt; And it does it, as you say, in this really insane but entirely creative way while showcasing everything such thinking has to offer.

It's crazy to you because it makes spontaneous additions, new flashbacks, layering meaning on top of another. It wasn't there all along and there have been very sudden changes, there's no groundedness you're used to. It's not a holistic meticulously designed narrative that's sturdy as rock, that's not its goal. It wants to be loose for its style, because its expression is ambiguous not deterministic, a feeling that is as vivid as reality cannot be just told by words, it has to be shown and heard instead and have the audience gather the meaning *they* have for themselves, because that's also reflective of their own individuality. That's the kind of artist Ikuhara is.

&gt; while there may still exist those who treat others in a derisive manner, there always exists those who will do ""what is right.""

That's pretty much your existence. On a rewatch when you decide to revisit the show to give it a second chance, think of the show as it actually appreciates what you do and how it directs it at other people. Then you can have a disagreement with its core methods in presentation.

Good, let the symbolism flow through you! &gt;:)

&gt; When others have given up their individuality, they become uninteresting, there is nothing there to relate to the person him/herself, hence they are invisible to the ""soulsight"". Hence Invisible Storm.

I like your way of looking at it, too. This kind of thinking goes back to my other comment I just gave you; being yourself is something that sounds simple but is really important. Sure, you can have others influence you or you can listen to what others have to say (everyone should do that!), but conforming yourself just to ""fit in"" is rather unhealthy. It not only goes against your own sense of self-worth -- by demeaning who you are as a person -- but also makes it seem as if what you are doing is ""wrong."" It's not wrong (obviously within reason) to be the kind of person you are, to believe in the things you do, to follow the feelings you have. In fact, it's what makes us unique, and therefore is what makes us connected beyond just the superficial.

&gt; Now please write off my pure assumptions because they are rather baseless xD (yay intuition!)

Haha, I can't do that. Because what you wrote -- when I sit down and think about it again -- is probably true to an extent.

With YKA, it has these themes and ideas that I myself follow; ""treat others as you would want to be treated."" And it does it, as you say, in this really insane but entirely creative way while showcasing everything such thinking has to offer. The good (Kureha's conviction), the bad (Mitsuko's obsession), and the ugly (Yuriika's betrayal); it goes about presenting the idea of prejudice, love, and religion -- areas that I myself hold strong values in -- in this intricate yet purposeful manner.

As for TTG, that could be it. Maybe on a subconscious level that's what it was, that my own large amount of optimism had me thinking that TTG's ending was something that I already knew to be true. Contrast with YKA's ending, where I loved the ambiguity of their conclusion -- I can *be* optimistic about their situation -- and loved the ""cycle"" repeating itself once more -- while their may still exist those who treat others in a derisive manner, there always exists those who will do ""what is right.""

"cm6vkqu","&gt; merely present day groupthink

I think you should double check the meaning of the word groupthink... Theism is groupthink; religiosity in the US is largely a result of cultural pressure. You could argue that actually, atheism is in some cases anti-groupthink, since it's born out of a desire to be nonconformist.

The scientific method may be partially enforced by groupthink, but its formulation and continued usage comes from effectiveness. Unless you are proposing a viable alternative (which I'd love to hear, since I'd be surprised to find a good one), arguing that the scientific method is ""groupthink"" is just a whimsical remark at best.

&gt; Your opinion is informed, but it's not forward thinking. You won't be hypothesizing any profound theories or making any revolutionary discoveries.

No, see, that's the distinction I'm making. The idea that subatomic particles are made up of strings rather than points is revolutionary and seemingly insane, but viable. You can build a mathematical framework and design experiments for some hypothetical future scientists to try. Does it have any practical consequences or actual validity right now? Not really. But it's still coherent.

The idea that there exists an invisible pink unicorn, for example, is meaningless, untestable, and therefore inherently unscientific. Even if we discovered an invisible pink unicorn tomorrow, it wouldn't mean some man tripping on LSD was justified in predicting its existence. Everybody who dismissed the idea would still have been justified (read: sane) as long as they hadn't intentionally ignored evidence. This would be where you would invoke the word ""lucky.""

That's the point. There is inherently no evidence for a higher being because it invokes a poorly-defined humanized concept, not one that has any verifiable consequences. The truth value of the claim is certainly unknown, but the claim itself is not meaningful in the first place. There's no forward-thinking; there's no new explanation or additional knowledge you've added. It's just a statement of personal gut feelings, something that has no bearing on physical outcomes.",1416396553,"the idea that subatomic particles are made up of strings rather than points is revolutionary and seemingly insane, but viable.","insane, but viable","insane","but",TRUE,"revolutionary and seemingly insane","revolutionary","seemingly",NA,0

**TRE**:

A ""wandering jew"" scenario, treat appropriately. This is a curse instead of a wonderful opportunity, if not handled correctly. The most interesting of the four, because of the relatively clear rules.

Shelter is missing from the list, but if you could be harmed falling off a cliff is taken into account, your need for a tent should be covered as well. Or a bank card with $100 to pay for that hotel. Guns are expensive, after all, so this isn't out of scope. So that's all the basics solved, in the ""wild"" or cities.

""Travel"" is such a strange thing to define. What does ""moving onward"" mean? As I don't normally travel, or even camp, I say travel means no permanent home or shelter that I own. So *for me*, travel is not a large distance. I move from one hotel to another in a major city with relative low crime. Every day, a new room to sleep in. Up and down the city streets, with everything I own every morning. Just to make sure, I spend my days exploring the city and surrounding area at random.

~~Japan~~ (Shit! Fuck! Almost died through weeaboo. Forgot about killer doomquakes. Damn, that was close.) France is my choice. Safe, high-tech, trains to move around fast, just in case I start to feel ""weak"" from not ""moving onward"". English-friendly enough to get a start. Give myself a few months to bone up on the language in ~~Tokyo's~~ Paris tourist areas, and I'm set for life. The point is, I can't die of old age. So I just have to wait for a future that will grant me even MORE powers, like ""normal"" physical immortality. Or maybe a new body, without this trapped backpack attached to it.

It's going to be a long wait, even for optimistic views of the future. Oh. And ""language affinity?"" Time to get a laptop while I hang out in major cities with free wi-fi. C++ is a ""language"", after all. Maybe I'll take a shot at that Friendly AI problem...

Oh. And if in the middle of a perfectly safe city, you find body armor, a gun, or (dog help you) an NBC suit in your pack one day, that would be a signal to ditch and run until you start getting nice things in your pack again.

A note: the 100 year swap thing is a shitty idea. Don't fucking do it, what is wrong with you? Unless on that day you are somehow the FBI Most Wanted, head of an international terrorist group, or basically about to be imprisoned and/or killed, why would you give up known sure things for totally unknown and poorly worded other worlds? No. Just, no.

**Fisher King**

GG, well played rest of the world. I've already got everything I really want. I'm am 100% safe (unless I fuck up) and I'm going to live forever. So calm down world, no evil ruler or nanobot golems (""that I can see""? Reeealy...) for you. Because I win. Everything else is just gravy.

Sorry, right. Details on how I'd live after getting almost everything I ever wanted handed to me.

I initially thought, bottom of the ocean. Then I thought, why? **Invincible house.** So, right in the middle of the most tectonically stable area I can find, over the longest period possible given shifting plates, but also with wi-fi. So, not California or Japan...(shit, revise TRE! Idiot!) and not Siberia. Without looking anything up, I'm thinking the middle of France. I'll look that up later to see if I'm right.

So. I live forever and no one can ever, ever, ever stop me. Because, why would I ever invite someone into my house so they can push me out of it and potentially kill me for good?

Why?

For sex or other companionship, you say? Well, given the golem rules, I'm about to get really, *really* good at biology, chemistry, all aspects of physiology, and psychology. Then I'll make a room out of the basic elemental building blocks of the human body and start making golems my lizard brain will think are good members of my ""in group"", so I can be a little saner as a chimp. They'll have better bodies (won't even need a digestive system at all or a brain, for example) but they'll need to look mostly like humans to be long-term psychological stabilizers.

But until then, well, I've still got the internet, radio, live video conferences, and every sex toy ever invented at my disposal to trick those primitive urges for socialization and sex.

After I become an expert at human bodies (robotics is still a disappointing waste of time) then the only question is, fully sentient companions or mobile sextoys? Depends on if that line means they *always* have a lifespan of a year or not. I'm not comfortable (yet) killing sentient beings in that way. Though that might change if I was removed sufficiently from the rest of the universe. Which I would. Because I'd never leave the building.

I'm thinking I don't want to ever make anything capable of pushing me outside, but I could simply make door-blocking golems that never, ever, ever let me outside. They look a lot like bank vault doors, except fewer handles. To open them, I'd have to intentionally make door-blocking-golem removing golems. Which I would never, ever do. Certainly not without make-me-not-fit-through-doors golems strapped to me first.

But they would be dumb robots made out of building materials. Only moral to make people (and if sentient, they would be people) who wouldn't mind never having friends over or ever being able to leave. Because I won't let them back in again, and they'll die in a year. And they'd need to be able to learn to like living forever. Because I'm not making things that want to die. That's stilly.

Oh right. And start funding archologies in the outer world, so I can make things larger than the [Boeing Everett Factory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Everett_Factory) is wide, and the [Burj Khalifa](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burj_Khalifa) is tall. Yes, I'm *that* greedy.

**Nakama**

If you make it to 13, I think it is fair to say you are trapped in a Banksian digital hell, a very subtle and insidious one. Because at that point, you now know how fucked up the world really is. As an infant. The moment you become ""you"", which might be as a cluster of neurons, because you are obviuosly not running your brain on matter. Or maybe three years later. Who knows. doesn't matter. You know everyone you ever cared for is gone, based on the pattern, and gone likely forever. Fuck your lives. And it doesn't even say you understand the rules. So this is all just dumped on you. Bogus.

That's even if you *don't* remember your former lives until #13. That isn't clear from the poorly worded rules. As others have pointed out, #13 is you being insane. Sooner if you remember every past life, every time. Maybe it is a happy kind of crazy, but you are not going to be well.

But seriously now? Why would you ever reach #13? Or even #4? If physical immortality isn't perfected in 12 human lifespans from now (remember *reincarnation*, not some peggy-sue resets) even assuming they don't keep getting longer, humanity is likely royally fucked anyway. #13 would just be me assuming the universe is actively malevolent, and me trying to fuck it over as hard as I could, however I could.

Because I'd be insane, but likely happy to take the entire universe down with me. Remember, I don't *know* that I'm not just Groundhog Daying from that point on, as I have no view of the rules of this process, just #13's memories of boringly happy lives, and of what was lost. Yeah. I'd be *pissed*.

---

**Dominion**

So, is this nothing has changed, except for getting easier for me every time I tell someone what to do? A sort of ""super-Lelouch?""

Or I am doomed to rule over Earth instead of doing what I want; and if I drop the ball, people will be pissed as they naturally would? Which means, *INSTANTLY* and likely fatally. Who needs 12 immortal rebels out for my blood? The second the Middle East can get an assassin at me, I'm dead. Because their problems are suddenly *my fault*, right? I'm not invincible, just unaging.

This one's definition and ruleset sucks. Does everyone know who I am overnight? Can I rule from secret, meeting with world leaders who all secretly acknowledge my authority? Do the 12 ~~evil exes~~ rebel scum *also* acknowledge my right to rule, per item #1? Do they simply always assume the worst and pick at the edges? Are they immune to my commands? If I say, 'no one is allowed to try and kill me', will they accept that? If I order the world to never undermine my rule, do they have to obey, thus making themselves useless? What, exactly, IS my power over others?

Disappointing. At *best*, it is simply RL++, which means I likely simply ignore the authority powers as soon as I discover the ""people expect me to rule well"" part. After that, I go about my business in obscurity while living forever.

Sooner or later, that McDonalds I accidentally took Dominion over will go out of business, and my rule will fall into the shadows of history, as will I.

Worst case, it is an inevitable death sentence, as those 12 people are not constrained as to how to take me out. Nor is *anyone else*.

"ckc1zq6","The insanity defense is actually really unlikely to work for Joker. He's clearly medically insane, but medical insanity does not necessarily result in a legal excuse. First, let's assess the three main insanity defenses in the United States: the M'Naughten Test, the *Durham* rule, and the Model Penal Code (MPC) tests. They're a bit different. I'll explain.

M'Naughten has a ton of different parts. As originally formulated, it goes like this:

&gt;[E]very man is to be presumed to be sane, and to possess a sufficient degree of reason to be responsible for his crimes, until the contrary be proved to their satisfaction; and that to establish a defence on the ground of insanity, it must be clearly proved that, at the time of the committing of the act, the party accused was labouring under such a defect of reason, from disease of the mind, as not to know the nature and quality of the act he was doing; or, if he did know it, that he did not know he was doing what was wrong.

So, first: the burden of proving insanity rests on the defendant. That is, the state need not prove Joker sane; Joker has to prove himself insane. Second, the defect has to come from a ""disease of the mind."" Joker likely passes this test, as he's clearly insane, though the exact diagnosis is going to vary. Third, Joker must not know what he's doing, OR not know that what he's doing is wrong. Here, he has the biggest problem. So, Joker clearly knows what he's doing -- he's an intricate planner, and doesn't operate in a fugue state or the like. He also clearly knows that what he's doing is wrong. This is why he takes pains to hide it from the police (and, sometimes, to reveal it to Batman). The point is that he's clearly aware of societal morals, and aware that he's violating them flagrantly. Even if we're not talking societal morals, several jurisdictions interpret this to mean ""knew that it was against the law,"" which Joker *clearly* does. No argument. I think under M'Naughten, Joker has an uphill fight every time.

The Durham rule is basically that, if the actions are the product of the mental illness (that is, the direct result) then you can't be held responsible, even if you could've resisted the impulse, and even if you knew it to be wrong. The Durham rule is only worth discussing in passing, as it's used basically nowhere at all. It did, however, lead to the MPC test, which is why I mention it. Here, Joker would win, but since it's basically not used, I don't think that's helpful.

The MPC test is that a defendant can't be convicted for otherwise criminal conduct

&gt;""if at the time of such conduct as a result of mental disease or defect he lacks substantial capacity either to appreciate the criminality of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law.""

Joker definitely appreciates the criminality of his actions. The question is whether he has the capacity to conform to the requirements of law -- that is, whether, even recognizing that it's illegal, he's capable of not violating the law. Here, I think the answer is definitely ""yes."" Joker is incredibly good at manipulation when he needs to be, including using the legal system. Things like, say, convincing a psychiatrist that you're in love with her, and getting her to break you out of jail. No funny murder or ironic comeuppance, just a plot to get out, with a henchwoman bonus. We can all talk about, for instance, why he doesn't kill Batman, but the fact that he doesn't, even when he could, is going to weigh against him. The idea here is that the impulse is irresistible (another way of formulating that last part of M'Naughten is the ""irresistible impulse"" test -- they basically borrowed that for the MPC). So... yeah. I think this goes against him for the same reason M'Naughton does -- he knows it's illegal, and could stop, but refuses to do so. He does it because he thinks it's funny, not because he believes he *must*. To compare, somebody like Zsasz probably has a better claim to an irresistible impulse, given the strange way he picks his targets, poses them, and carves their tally into his skin.

Anyway. The other possibility is that he's avoiding trial altogether by being held incompetent. Now, the competency threshold isn't really gonna work for someone like Joker -- he's aware of what a judge and a jury are, who the prosecutor is, and that he's on trial, which is really all that's needed. [Here is a more detailed, though still brief, discussion of competency](http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/competency-stand-trial.html). Anyway, he's clearly not gibbering or lost in a courtroom, so he doesn't get off there, either.

BTW, in most jurisdictions, Joker would have to prove his insanity by the preponderance of the evidence -- that is, 50.000...01% chance he's insane. Then the burden shifts to the prosecution to disprove it. However, in federal law, he has to prove it by ""clear and convincing evidence,"" which is above preponderance, but below the ""reasonable doubt"" standard of criminal conviction. That's just to say that Joker would have to prove more than that it's *possible* that he's incapable of understanding or restraining his actions; he'd have to prove that it's *really clear and convincingly true*. Note that the vast majority of Joker's crimes are likely federal, of one sort or another, so they'd be likely to take his prosecution out of the hands of the notoriously ineffective Gotham DA's office's hands.",1410136658,"he's clearly medically insane, but medical insanity does not necessarily result in a legal excuse.","insane, but medical","insane","but",TRUE,"medically insane , but medical","medical","medically",NA,1

"ciiy5v9","&gt;In all of this, though, I think you put too much weight on the human capacity to lie and exaggerate (in service of self-serving motives, such as self-aggrandizement) and far too little in the human capacity to seek and reflect truth. And I thought atheists were the ones arguing that, contra main-stream Christianity, human beings aren't ""damaged goods"" (no ""original sin"").

It is merely a recognition that people do lie (or are tricked, or have hallucinated, etc.), and thus we must be very careful with how we treat extraordinary claims.

If we weren't skeptical in such matters, we'd all get taken in the first time we get an email from a Nigerian who wants to make us rich.

&gt;but Christians are much more willing to put faith in the human capacity for good and for seeking and discovering and for dying for ""the Truth"".

Well that's certainly an unfounded claim.

&gt;The question, of course, is, ""Even if the disciples of Jesus were inclined to make up some lie, or were particularly inclined to delusion--why this lie; why this delusion.""

I could ask the same question -- why *that* specific lie? -- of the Nigerian email scams. Who knows?

As for delusion, the assertion is not that the disciples themselves were specifically inclined to delusion, it's that we are *all* inclined to delusion. Human perception is notoriously fickle. We have an uncanny ability to fool ourselves, or to be fooled. Magicians thrive on that.

&gt;It hasn't even been established why they would lie at all.

Okay. But I never said I thought they were lying. I explicitly stated that their willingness to endure persecution is a good indicator that their beliefs were sincere. But just because someone is sincere in their belief doesn't mean we should share those beliefs. Do you believe in alien abductions, or that Elvis is still alive and hiding in the New Mexico desert? Because some people sincerely do.

&gt;Resurrection seems almost commonplace among us today

If you're referring to people being medically revived, that's not resurrection. *Death* is permanent. There have been many people who have been medically revived from near-death, but no one who has been revived from *death* death.

There's a quote from the film 'The Princess Bride' which illustrates this point perfectly: 

""It just so happens that your friend here is only MOSTLY dead. There's a big difference between mostly dead and all dead. Mostly dead is slightly alive. With all dead, well, with all dead there's usually only one thing you can do. Go through his clothes and look for loose change. ""

&gt;You can speculate why they would have made up something like that, but only from the perspective of someone who already lives in a world where that doesn't sound insane. (You say it sounds insane, but I would suggest it doesn't have quite the ring of insanity to you who grew up with this story, as it did to the original audience.

I disagree with that. It still sounds insane and absurd to me. 

&gt;It's even possible that Scientology sounds less strange to us than the Resurrection did in the first century.

The miracles attributed to Christ sound as insane to me as anything you'll find in Scientology. 

&gt;There were probably hundred of more useful, more plausible, stories the disciples could have told. Why pick this one?

Again, I don't necessarily believe they were lying. I think it more plausible that they were deceived or that they hallucinated, as opposed to them lying. And even them hallucinating is not the most plausible theory.

I think I've already related what I believe to be the *most* plausible scenario: that the story of Christ's resurrection was similar to an urban legend. It started out with a simple and entirely plausible nugget of truth, but the story is exaggerated with each retelling until it reaches mythic proportions. Like that fish your grandfather caught 20 years ago, which grows a few inches with each retelling of the story.

"cgbq7d8","I am interested in the bug that crawls into the Lost Sinner's mask at the start of the fight. The bug seems to make the Sinner quite upset which is notable because we have seen this at least once before in Dark Souls.

I have in the past had a thought that there may be something interesting to say about the Sunlight Maggot's existence. Solaire spends all of Dark Souls 1 searching for his sun and I think that, in the end, he gets exactly what he is searching for. He finds just what he has lost. The Chaos bug that drops the Sunlight Maggot is distinctive for its glowing red eyes and of course its drop. I don't know if there's a ton of basis for this, but I think its possible that, right before losing his deity-status, Solaire as the God of War hid a fragment of his power somewhere quiet and remote in the hopes that he may be drawn to find and regain it in his new life. In his new existence as a human, he may not have his memories but he may hope to have inclinations and deep-held desires that will lead him back to his sun, his power. After losing his status, as we know, he sets out on a course of action-- he is drawn to become undead, walk the lands of Lordran in search of his sun and, if he doesn't find what he is looking for, assist in killing Gwyn. If he does find his sun, he goes insane (perhaps a fail-safe from Gywn to keep him from regaining his status? Perhaps his now undead body just cant handle his old power and it makes him insane), insane but delighted because he has completed his quest- finding his sun was all he'd ever hoped for in his new life. (Obviously just my personal speculation!! :) )

Can we apply this same theory to the Lost Sinner and to the Witch of Izalith in some way?

"cfsuism","TL;DR: If you really like Wargame: Airland Battle, pass on Red Dragon; even for this stage of beta, the game is very very far from releaseable quality, and some of the worst elements may get fixed in the coming months but several of the worst aspects are working as intended and will probably only be further articulated in the same direction.

First, the good. New deck system is pretty great, you have to start making serious decisions about how you want to play the game early on and the “no-brainer” skeleton of a deck that you carry across all factions/designs is much smaller, and it intrinsically makes plane spam harder.

Following on that, recon and vehicles aren't really garbage categories that you pick the minimum of bizarre utility options from - combat recon vehicles now have high enough availability to be useable, and both categories include options that can help plug holes from other parts of the deck due to low number of slots. 

Getting infantry into occupied urban sectors is easier, though that may have just been my problem.

The new factions are fairly successfully designed, and the Red Dragons in particular are an absolute circus of insane but good boondoggles (really it's a near monopoly on weird units). 

ADATs are much more usable and they're really cool.

Now for the bad.

Naval has been mentioned before - the system is not merely nonfunctional, but seems to be completely absent any vision. Pretty much every mechanical aspect of navies needs to be thrown out and done over from the beginning. There are several workable plans that would make the naval system more interesting without requiring oodles of new code, mostly pushing numbers around, but there is no indication that any such plan will be enacted, and without such effort navies are simply and purely unfun.

Extreme homogenization of units. The most obvious example is Radar SAMs - all radar SAMs are now [GUID], which puts a really sharp cap on ROF for the entire class of units, so that radar SAMs just have cost, range, damage, and accuracy stats, so the OSA for example had to be rewritten as just a discount Buk - and all Radar SAMs are just now Buks/Hawks that are better or worse. Artillery is even more extreme, artillery all now fire slowly and with high damage but low morale effect so that all artillery pieces are just variations on 203mm cannons. Smoking, stunning, and panicking with artillery are fruitless endeavors, so there's nothing in RD that have the same functionality as ALB Nonas or Lars. Artillery winds up being used very similar to how its used in Advance Wars, for example.

Air assaulting oh god air assaulting. AA is pretty much broadly worse and particularly worse at dealing with multiple targets, but it's much much easier to get 20+ helicopters per player on the field in deployment than ever, and the map design is really built around facilitating helicopter play as much as possible. A successful opening air assault has gone from “really good” to “absolutely essential.” Helicopters are much more effective at killing tanks, to the point where the lauded “supertanks” like M1A2 and Chall2 are basically like flushing points down a toilet.",1393809109,"the new factions are fairly successfully designed, and the red dragons in particular are an absolute circus of insane but good boondoggles (really it's a near monopoly on weird units).","insane but good","insane","but",FALSE,"insane but good","good",NA,NA,1

"cf5uqlm","It's not to imply, on my part, at least, that someone who is not deemed insane should be executed. This is important to point out because the form that the punitive criminal justice takes is one that produces a lot of ""anchoring"" effects as it issues judgments: once one is ""in the ball park"" of the business of weighing sentences, then it's a matter of X or Y or Z, which has a strong tendency to force background assumptions. As we say ""15 years or life or the death penalty, which is it?"", this puts into the background the question of whether punitive sentencing should be used. Certainly, serial killers, and others, do use such sentencing for their punishing aims, but others may not support that. The anchor is dropped in the balancing of scales, which are meant, typically, to refer to visiting harm or violence on a perpetrator of a violence or harm, as if these can be balanced out. Other versions of the scale have to do with the equity between parties (although of course the victim/complainant may not be a alive), but restoring equity isn't the same as, nor can it be truly effectuated through, matching an impinging harm with some original offense.

"cdtfzmj","I can understand them wanting to cut their ability to swat aircraft, but the nerf has made the increased velocity all but symbolic now.  I'm sure they could have cut it back and have it still have been useful at the same time.

And yes, the other tanks need some improvements.  The Magrider isn't bad, but the Magburner needs to be actually useful again.  The Vanguard should have a larger splash damage radius on all round types (nothing insane, but useful) which would help mitigate it's slow firing speed.  That, and/or an actual railgun type weapon that has massive AP damage, high velocity, little drop, slow RoF and zero splash.  The Vanguard is the best at being a wall of metal and shields, but not much else.

Some may disagree, but I also think *all* tanks, Lightning included, should have a coaxial barrel mounted LMG.  Doing this wouldn't suddenly make you an AI slaughter-machine.  If you zipped into the middle of a full enemy base expecting that your LMG would protect you, you're gonna have a bad time.  It *would* however, help you out when those LA come flying straight at you to poop C4 on you.  I'm a pretty good shot, but I can't always shoot an infantry dude out of the air, and have been left blown to pieces on more than one occasion...  That's pretty bogus.  An LMG would have helped me out, and would be much more of a defensive than an offensive weapon.

One nerf I think a lot of people could agree on is vehicle exit time.  They took away air pilots ability to simply bail (unless they have the ejection system) but ground vehicle drivers can still do this.  It's extremely frustrating both for infantry AND drivers/gunners because on any given day 25%(unlucky) - 75%(lucky) of vehicle kills are also player kills.  I think all vehicles should have their own individual enter/exit delays.  For example:

* Flash: Instant.  You can be shot off it anyway.

* Lightning: 2 second delay

* MBT: 3 second delay

"cdkzna7","After some introspection, I've decided that my current morality is based on whatever is overall best for human survival.  Currently, rape and murder are obviously immoral because it's disharmonious and causes social turmoil which is detrimental to human life and advancement.

If we suppose a God, then his power over humanity dictates my adherence to his will.  If he orders the murder of an individual then it is moral to do so because of the possible severe consequences of disobedience (he kills 1,000 people instead or sends all of us to hell. Also the possible benefits of obedience Ex: Kill this person and he wipes out AIDS - a net positive for humanity).  Does this mean God is immoral to order such a thing when he could have just cured AIDS outright? Possibly. In my opinion it's too complex an issue.  I don't believe god is something I could quantify as good or evil as I couldn't possibly begin understand him.  Perhaps there's some universal-level rationale and coherence (or maybe he's completely chaotic and insane) but it would be beyond me. Maybe it's all for the overall benefit of humanity, maybe not.

"cdgituk","All female mammal lubricate, it makes the process of _coitus_ (inserting the penis into the vagina) much easier.

In most species, the female lubricates when she goes into _estrus_: when she is fertile, her body undergoes a number of changes to prepare for coitus and the subsequent pregnancy.  If you have ever had an unspayed female cat or dog, you've seen her go into ""heat"".  She yawls, she smells funny, she walks around with her hindquarters in the air... and she lubricates.

Human females, you've noticed, don't do that.  Humans have _cryptic_ (hidden) estrus, so you cannot easily tell when a woman is in the fertile days of her menstrual cycle.

The two consequences of this are:

* always use birth-control if you don't want a baby
* she only lubricates when she's sexually aroused

You can think of lubrication as analogous to getting an erection.  Sometimes kissing (or even just sexual thoughts) is enough to cause it; sometimes it requires physical stimulation.

I think the word ""fingering"" might be misleading.  You don't have to penetrate her with your finger, and it doesn't help that much if you do.  Most of her sensation is wired through her clitoris, located where her labia meet above the vagina.  Gentle stimulation of that area will arouse her.

But getting your hand down her pants is not the key to arousing her.  Much more than men, women react to the entire situation.  If she feels protected, loved, and desired,  she's halfway there.  Even once you get down to touching, women have odd, remote spots that trigger arousal: her ears, the hollows of her elbows, the nape of her neck.  Every woman is slightly different but if any woman is just about ""boobs and pussy"", I haven't met her yet.

You can't really use lubrication as a guide of how to arouse her.  It's what economists call a ""trailing indicator"", she'll lubricate after she's already been aroused for a minute or two.  A much more reliable guide is her breathing: when you're doing it right, she'll breathe in or out, sharply but unsteadily.  Once you're used to it, that quiet huh-huh-huh is like the roar of an engine when you stomp on the gas, ""Here we go!""

If you want to get as sense of the difference when a lubricated vulva and one that isn't, touch your own lips (on your mouth, silly!) right now, then wet them thoroughly with your tongue and touch them again.  That's roughly the difference you should expect.

If she's not lubricating, one possibility is that she's not aroused yet.  Being a good lover is like being a good nurse: monitor her breathing, her heartbeat, the dilation of her pupils (if it's light enough), and her muscle tone.  If those aren't all above average, she's not aroused yet.

Some girls, though, do have a problem of not lubricating sufficiently even when they are aroused.  You can buy artificial lubricants for this situation (some people like additional lubrication anyway, to enhance the experience).  Be careful: some lubricants attack the latex of condoms.  Insane but true.  If you're using condoms, and you probably should, check the bottle the artificial lube for warnings.

Yes, when you go down on her, you will get some of her lubricant in your mouth.  You can't actually taste it, it's too much like what's in your mouth already.  Some people claim it tastes like honey, but they are actually responding to their own emotional state and to some extent to the oils and bacteria in their partner's sweat (which is meaty rather than sweet, but when you're in a good mood, everything tastes like honey.)",1384716313,"insane but true.","insane but true","insane","but",FALSE,"insane but true","true",NA,NA,1
"cdc9sfh","Okay, here goes, two main protags and two main antags (in alphabetical order -- see if it's obvious who's who). I should probably start off by saying my genre is fantasy, so a lot of world backstory is left out, but that shouldn't matter too much:

#1 - She was the accidental child of a mixed race pairing; uncommon and undesired. Raised more by tutors than family, she relies on her knowledge and curiosity to motivate her to rise above her beginnings and make something of herself in the world; of course this curiosity leads to her become embroiled in various interesting and dangerous plots that may amount to either the saving or destruction of the world.

#2 - He is genuinely insane, but more than that, he has been elected as the agent, in the mortal world, of one or more deities. He is plagued by dreams and visions he doesn't always understand, drawing feverishly in hopes of making some sense of things. His only clear communications from the godworld come when he kills himself or is killed, and is then returned to life with a message (the only known person to still receive this gift, which was revoked from the world at large a generation ago for unknown reasons).

#3 - She is the oldest living Vakiri (my world's version of a vampire-like creature), having watched generations live and die while knowing that if she is killed she cannot be returned to the godworld or hope to be resurrected. She has spent this time mastering the rare art (practicable only by the Vakiri up until present) of 'ka bending (my world's version of magic), and now she may have a chance to return to the god world as a god herself, if she is willing to sacrifice the mortal world in the process.

#4 - She is exiled from her homeland for refusing to go through with an arranged marriage, and nearly dies in her efforts to find a new place to belong. After reluctantly accepting help from someone of (what she considers) a lesser race, she does find a place to belong, though she is sometimes troubled by the exact nature of that place. In doing her best to please, she becomes instrumental in carrying out a plot that is much larger than she comprehends.

"ccs8nrt","Great Fan Fiction piece I think of everytime I see Inspector Gadget Now:

Inspector Gadget was basically Get Smart meets RoboCop: A bumbling inspector with robotic enhancements fights crime with the help of his young niece and her dog, both of whom are vastly smarter than him. Gadget's main antagonist is the evil Dr. Claw, whose face is never revealed in the series and, according to a theory posted on various sites, that's because Dr. Claw is the real Inspector Gadget. The main character is actually a robot duplicate of the man Claw once was, who was driven insane by an accident and now wants to destroy the machine that replaced him. But there's no way that makes sense, right? There are a lot of things that the show never bothered to explain, and this theory covers them better than the crappy live-action movie ever did. For starters, why does Gadget have robot parts? It seems unlikely that he would have been chosen for some sort of police-enhancing program, considering that he's a total moron and all. No, there had to be some sort of tragic accident in his past, but he doesn't seem to remember it. Then there's Dr. Claw: Not only do we never see his face in the show (the action figure that revealed it came out years after the show had gone off the air), but the only thing we see is his metal hand, almost like an artificial limb. Also, his voice sounds like someone fellating a garbage disposal -- it's pretty obvious that Claw was involved in some sort of accident, too. Coincidence? We think not. According to the theory, ""Claw"" was once a normal human detective, but a terrible explosion caused his family and friends to think him dead. That's where his conveniently smart niece comes in: Penny, in her grief, recreated her uncle as a crime-fighting robot ... ignoring that the real man wasn't dead, only disfigured and insane. This would also explain why nothing ever happens to Penny, even though Claw's cronies seem to catch her every episode: She always finds a way to ruin Claw's plans because she's the only thing he still cares for.
And hey, remember the part at the end of the opening theme where Gadget turns Claw's chair around and there's a bomb in it? A bomb that then explodes in Gadget's face? Perhaps this was meant to be symbolic. Perhaps there's no Claw, just Gadget.

TLDR: [The Claw is the real Inspector Gadget](http://www.cracked.com/article_19882_6-insane-but-convincing-fan-theories-about-kids-cartoons.html).

My GP is a more open to ""alternative"" approaches, so after doing some research, I brought in some articles from PubMed and talked it over with her. She said that she was comfortable with it as long as we kept an eye on my lipid levels (I have a very high risk heart disease history in my family) and remarked that, from what she had seen in recent research, it seems like the body handles high (complex) carb, low fat and high fat, low carb diets equally well as long as you follow them faithfully.

Hence, I don't follow this guy. He is playing a part that I don't believe he owns.

EDIT: I am quoting his political belief system as it is another system, much like the one Buddhism, Islam, etc. represent. I will openly challenge any Buddhist to a debate on politics and which one best fits Buddhist ideologies. For me, it's Libertarianism as that is truly free and allows people to truly be themselves (let alone discover themselves). Communism conflicts with so many teachings I find it short of insane, but full on ridiculous, the Dalai Lama likes it. 

P.S. down votes aren't rebuttal's. I expect more from Buddhist's then to just down vote things they disagree with. Sorry you don't like the fact I don't like the Dalai Lama but that's not worth a down vote.

2. http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198089341848/

3. Ah, college. A great time in anyone's life. I have a buttload of advice to prepare for.

a.) Meals. While in college it is expected that you will take on debt. What advice can I counter to stop collected debt while there? Free meals. There are several events at my school in which I can obtain free food. These events are things such as farmer's market samples, surveys for fast food, etc. As you progress you will learn the in's and outs of each trick. In the event you are not on a food plan, ramen is king along with cheap sandwich choices, and the occasional canned good. Always remember: when someone offers you to pay the bill, you accept. When my parents offer to take me out I will accept 99.99% of the time. And finally: home cooked meals are much better than fast food or eateries. They are both healthier and cheaper, and will often taste better with the use of crock pots, rice cookers, microwave ovens, and other appliances.

b.) Be active. Don't get stuck on playing games and letting your grades slack, but don't let your grades stop you from being active and maintaining a social life. My definition of activity is inclusions of a job, and frequent visits to the gym. Many freshman become fat simply from either overindulgence when on meal plans and low activity or even mental problems such as loneliness or self inflicted low confidence. In order to keep both your physical well being and your mental well being in check, make sure you do SOMETHING that gets you out of the dorm room and inactivity that many fall trap to the first year away from home.

b. part 2.) GOOD MUSIC. Now I know this might seem insane, but good music is very encouraging and will keep you active.  It will get you off your feet and looking in the mirror saying:  ""what workout should I do today?"" In a way, music can be all the motivation you need.

c.) WORK HARD. Might seem cliche, but maintaining a job and taking in as low debt as possible is KING in college, unless you want to have an awful credit score after graduation day. If you have supportive parents, keep a great relationship and communicate frequently. Mine are well aware of college (my dad worked at least 40 hours a week while in college) and the benefits of making smart decisions. Procrastination will kill you when it creeps up.

c. part 2.) Internships. I can't stress this enough. If you want to be employed out of college quickly and efficiently, internships are great for this alone. Many people from where I am will hire college students directly out of college just for showing efficiency in a work environment based setting. Not only that, you will gain valuable experience which might help you in the future workplace!

d.) Smart spending. I'm not one to advocate over expenditures, but steam has, well, affected all of our wallets over the years. Don't spend on something unless you need it, with the occasional want if it is responsible. Before spending on something ask yourself: ""do I need this?"" or ""can I make do without it?"" In fact, I advocate keeping a budget. When you take in money from a work, donate most of it to etc (what needs to be paid) and a smaller portion to what you want. Then when something comes around that you really want you have a prepared fund for just that.

e.) Clothing and growth. This partially fits into my earlier point about ""being monetarily responsible."" Don't buy over excessive amounts of a grade clothing. I'm not saying avoid nice clothing all together, of course. I'm just saying you don't need Polo brand shirts to sleep in every night. Walmart may save you a quick buck when it gives you clothing you are not seen in. Lastly, do not buy clothing if you have plenty that fits already. 

f.) Remaining well rested. If you aren't well rested from cramming all night for an exam, it can seriously affect how you perform in a lecture settings or even how you interact with others. If you can, at least 6 hours a night is great. Just keep in mind that this might not even be possible most nights. It's tough to remain rested as well as keeping on time for classes, but a healthy night's sleep will do wonders for both.

g.) Don't be afraid to try new things. Loneliness and homesickness is killer in college, new clubs and activities will allow you to meet new people (including romantic interests). It's a great feeling to be involved in something that is not only bigger than yourself, but something that will also be life enriching for yourself. As mentioned in my last post, you will even possibly gain exercise which is difficult to get when you are busy around the clock.

h.) Don't cut class, no matter how easy the subject is. Always remember, what you do in college, knowledge is power and will only strengthen your career. ""Ya snooze, ya looze.""

i.) Don't over party, bro. I can't name how many people have dropped out from this because they couldn't handle it. Not saying it happens to everyone, but it can put you in a bad situation if you let it rule your life. make sure you keep a good balance between both a social life and keeping good grades.

h.) DON'T BE WORRIED. College is not something to be worried for, as long as you are well prepared. Everyone is affected differently by it; some blossom, others don't. As long as you are well aware of these things, you will meet success 100% of the time.

And finally, my most important advice of all...

i.) Be true to yourself. Again, might seem cliche, but stick to your morals. Not to harp on groups known for hazing or other activities, but peer pressure can seriously affect your life in a negative way. No matter what your ""friends"" tell you to do, if it is wrong don't do it. You might have heard the phrase ""but this isn't harmful to me;"" to that I add an anecdote: ""but will it harm me, my future or my friendships?

* The man who took in the lost boy had been following and watching them
* The man promised the boy sanctuary after leaving his father

And I'm not saying 'this is exactly what happened and the text says it plain and bold' either. It's symbolism. I'm not talking about exactly what happened in the text. It could also be said that the boy died soon after his father died, that they both died. 
  
What matters is that the boy was taken into religious sanctuary by a watchful savior and that the boy chose to pray to his father rather than to god.  
  
It goes into the territory of the mysterious nature of 'god' or godlike figures (a huge McCarthy theme that can be seen in other places like with Anton in NCfOM). The figure that brought the fiery apocalypse still expects to be worshiped, and the boy invests his worship in his father instead.

When you say the statement "" men can help stop rape"" its a term that directs us to believe a man will tell another to not rape which is a myth in itself cause how would that other guy know ? its not something you'll actively discuss with your male friends.

&gt;Instead, they don't believe women when they've said they've been raped. Instead, they try to detract from the statistics that say things like how 1 in 5 women are raped.

1 in 5 has been debunked for some time cause in the US your more likely to be hit by a bus but theres a major issue of women lying about rape and thats why some women aren't believed. In the US women have been arrested and charged for falsely accusing men and wasting police resources but rape is a huge agenda point for Feminism and if that went away the movement would lose alot of their power.

&gt;I don't think it's as much misogyny as the fact that they know that they they'd never do such a thing: but there are men who DO. How can we address such things without blaming men in particular, but noting that this type of man is causing a very big problem?

There could be many methods from making porn more freely available off the internet to other different things that don't put women into dangerous situations. Generalizing and predatorizing men isn't the answer cause your saying aa majority of men are ""potential rapists"" when they aren't and you have to go towards that minority and those guys need jail time and rehabilitation. 

&gt;I wouldn't benefit too much from self-defense because I am disabled. Or perhaps I'd benefit from it more, who knows? But it definitely makes me particularly fearful, because I know my ability to fight back is limited.

It really depends on your disability. If your movement isn't good i'd suggest checking with your local police to see if a concealed object would be better cause a small can of mace or pepper spray is (i believe) legal in some states.

There was still quite a few people there, and I had been sitting next to this older gentleman in his 50-60's.

Then, this small asian guy in his probably 30s stands in between me and the older gentleman, looks at both of us without saying a word.. and then reaches to his machine and hits the cash out button on his machine. The older lad starts screaming at him something along the lines of ""Hey I'm playing this, what are you doing?!""

I'm a Mason!!
Okay okay, as excited as I am to post about my wedding I'm going to hold off until my pictures are ready. 
Until then, I'm going to write all about my incredibly interesting wedding night. 
...Well, not all the details... 
So, Ken and I stayed at a B&amp;B for our wedding night. We were convinced that it may just be our first and only night as a married couple. It was one of the oddest and most uncomfortable experiences in my life, but has made for a very funny story. Here's just a small taste of our adventure. There is so much more to it so feel free to ask for details.My mom was kind enough to book us a B&amp;B for our wedding night... It seemed like a good idea at the time. 
Turns out she booked us the most bonkers bed and breakfast of all time. That's right, and B&amp;B&amp;B...
The only thing that would've made it better would've been if the bed had a coin slot where I could put quarters in that would make the bed vibrate. 

We were also treated to the most decadent of chocolates - Misty Mints. 

The owner repeatidly INSISTED that we could make as much noise as we wanted. ""Nobody can hear you scream."" Which was especially frightening due to the amount of axes, pitchforks, and seemingly mass grave in the backyard. 

We were quite pleased to see that the room came with a TV as well as a handmade clock. This clock was made with pearls, doilies, and fake flowers. It is purely for aesthetics. It doesn't actually work at all. 

There was a fine selection of VHS tapes. Everything from The Bible to Ace Ventura-When Nature Calls!


And my favorite part of the entire experience... 
The artwork. Upon entering the owner pointed to this painting and said ""Yes. I paint. This is a social commentary on marriage and how it can be very abusive. See all the opposites?...Ya.. My first two marriages were VERY abusive....This one's...all right...."" 

Other entertaining parts: 
In the morning as we ate breakfast the owner repeatidly offered to give me painting lessons.
She complained about how hard it is to write a book. ""I'm writing 3 books...at the same time...And I just can't decide if I should write them so they can be put into a movie. It's really hard.""
There was actually veery delicious jam on the breakfast table that was in an old salsa jar. Ken jokingly asked me to ""pass the salsa"". She then bolted into the kitchen saying ""It's not salsa!"" 
...There was soo so much more, but I've blocked almost all things from my memory at this point.

Sounds like he had to gain a bunch of weight for a different role. He had to get real flabby for some comedy movie he filmed after Zero Dark Thirty and now he's going to have to get super buff and lean for some movie where he's playing a super hero. 

Sounds a lot like the extreme body changes Christian Bale has had to go through to get his body to fit the various roles he plays.

Imagine men are drawing on the painting as the battle ensues, sealing their target's fate just as you sealed that of your enemies. Some are good painters, some are bad, but all will use tactics, just like you. Well, not **just** like you, there are some minor differences, such as:

* Throwing balls of light into crowded rooms of men, blinding them with a light greater than that of any deity imaginable, is a favorable tactic due to it's ease and affect on the morale of the enemy.
* Creating makeshift 1-man camps in the corners of rooms as to ambush the enemy as they travel past, a tactic known as ""*camping*.""
* Rather than swords, they fight with daggers that seemingly give the ability to fly towards a nearby enemy at great speed, causing great shooters to be little more than sacks of meat.
* These metal rods do not only shoot smaller rods of metal, but smaller, **explosive** rods of metal! Firing upon your opponent with these, however, is considered by many an act of cowardice, and is punishable by inserting your (often still virgin) penis into the shooter's mother, a concept many of our men find hard to believe but have been told true by many members of the *Community of Drawers*, or *COD*.
* In addition to explosive shots, you can also choose to fire many, many very small shots at one time, but due to it's devastating effects anyone caught using it is supposedly to be put to death by fire or sold into slavery, being referred to as ""faggots"" or ""niggers.""
* Your shooters fire upon enemies from far, far away, but surprisingly, the long-ranged fighters of the future use tactics such as (bear with me, as these seem not only insane but suicidal): Jumping from heights, spinning around in circles, rapidly pulling their fire-stick towards their face as they shoot, and, charging towards the enemy armed with a dagger and shooter meant for long-ranged combat, and going limp and falling to the ground in a heap while shooting as to avoid enemy fire at close range and simultaneously counter attack.

Not necessarily.  There is some controversy in Marx studies about this.  I'm not sure why you think it's insane.  Insanely unlikely?

&gt; Marxism was ""scientistic"", not actually scientific.

I'm not sure how you're understanding the terminological distinction, but I simply meant that it's a normative claim based on the epistemological validity of science, so it sounds like you are claiming that you think scientific findings (like that related to Stockholm Syndrome) have no normative significance, because science is just another way to look at the situation?  I.e. the kidnapper's claim that their slave just wants to stay is her 'choice' has to be given equal weight to the scientist's findings that show judgment was impaired?

&gt; The problem is that defining human flourishing is inherently a normative task.

I agree.  Clearly Marxism is normative.

&gt; True mental/intellectual freedom is only found in nihilism...This is why I call that kind of freedom a worthless phantasm we shouldn't even bother chasing.

I don't question the epistemological strength of science.  I don't need to, since as you put it, Marxism was ""scientistic"", not actually scientific.

&gt;From the point of view of Marxism (and science..and philosophy!) this applies the wrong standard. The point is to obtain an objective understanding of the conditions of human flourishing, and precisely not to just let people do whatever. 

The problem is that defining human flourishing is inherently a normative task.

&gt;I'm not sure what you mean by this. If it's that liberalism verges on and may ultimately become nihilism, I agree. This is my main problem with liberalism.

"c65psiw","On the opposite side, I was kidnapped by my mom. It was 7th grade and we were living in Florida. My mom got into drugs and alcohol and shacked up with an abusive crack head before going back to Connecticut, where we were originally from. Me and my two brothers ended up with my dad. It was a bit rough since he worked 12 hours a day to support us all and slept on the couch because we could only afford a 2 bedroom apartment.

My mom wants to come down to visit so my dad allows it. She wants to get back together and he says no, because obviously she is psycho and on drugs. She calls the cops and claims that my dad beat her (which he didn't) and the cops were all too happy to take my dad to jail after roughing him up a bit first (my dad didn't go peacefully.. he isn't exactly a fan of cops and made sure they were aware of this).

Anyways, after the excitement my mom says she is taking us back to Connecticut. She grabs a bunch of stuff, takes my dad's car and goes to my dad's relatives in state with the sob story of how he beat her and she needs to get us kids to safety. Interesting side note: in the middle of the night when my dad got out of jail he found out where my mom was staying and stole the car back. I remember my mom and my 80 year old aunt running after the car yelling for my dad to stop.

My mom gets us on a greyhound bus and thus started an awkward, boring, and shitty 24 hour bus ride with a bunch of interesting people that I half blocked out. During the ride, my mom calls my dad's father (very conservative, wealthy man who my brothers were very close with) and told the whole sob story again. My grandpa, being a smart man, told my mom that he was on her side and he would meet her at the bus station. When we arrived, my grandpa told my mom that he was taking us back to his house in CT and that she should get her stuff and meet us there. My mom leaves, my grandpa gets into the car and totally uncharacteristically badass of him says ""stupid bitch"" and drives in the opposite direction. He takes us to Maryland to my aunt's house where my grandma was visiting (also very close, she watched all of us when we were growing up and my parents worked) and they sat down and asked us what happened, what we wanted, did we want to live with them, our mom, or our dad. After all of us unanimously saying living with dad was fun and mom was full of shit, he put us on a plane back to Florida. At school the kids asked me where I was the previous week and I just responded ""on vacation.""

Thus began an equally crazy ride with my dad involving cops waking us up at 5am to tell us our dad has gotten himself into trouble, waking up to a bunch of sweaty dudes doing cocaine and playing basketball at 3am at my house, and random 20 year old girls naked sleeping on the floor. My dad was psycho in a Hunter S. Thompson way, but he always put food on the table and always made sure we had what we needed. Because of him I am insane but successful and responsible.

Heh, maybe, like, that's why you're so crazy and mad cause, ugh, like your dick broke off and now you're this angry little dickless dude.

Really though - if you spent less time frying what's left of your brain on drugs and alcohol and more time learning to understand the big picture then you would know that personally visiting a place does not give you any sort of wide perspective - the opposite actually.  Knowing one or two isolated cases really biased your own view.  If all you do is hang out with gay hipsters then your world would feel a lot different than the poor family being kicked out of their homes for being a certain religion.  You are so busy chasing pussy and getting high - acting like a horny teenager, you dare speak for the oppressed and suffering. 

Yah man, you know this gay guy in Lebanon therefore the whole place is a progressive paradise.  You are so fried you cannot see the whole place going to hell around you.  

I am right - every Islamic country on the planet is a complete shit hole.  Not only are they murdering and terrorizing other religions, they cannot even keep from slaughtering Sunni from Shiite.    

250 years of colonialism did it you say?  Nonsense.  Iraq, with little more than 2-3 years devolved so quickly into civil war and anarchy the US occupation had no chance of completing any objective.  Modern day Afghanistan - similar to Iraq - NATO had no idea what they were getting into.  The people there are totally insane and completely resistant to any sort of foreign assistance.  Look at Libya today versus how it was under the control of Qaddafi - a total mess.  It doesn't take 250 years to turn a place from a glowing wonderland to a nightmare.  It needs two things - 1. deep seeded hatred for ""the other"" and 2. an opportunity to exploit that hatred.

Plenty of other places were colonized (a little place called the New World) and they haven't devolved into a complete mess as bad as any Islamic country.

"c60tou7","I drive more than most, and when I was younger I used to do the typical stupid shit including going at speeds well over 150 km/h. Top speed I've been at was 250 km/h, incredibly stupid and insane but I was to stuck up with the, it's not so bad attitude.

Doing 150 km/h on the 401 may not be unsafe . . . until you have something go wrong on your car, some other car, you fuck up, or someone else fucks up. Then it's all over but the burial's, but hey it save your a few minutes of your day right? Last year, doing 60 km/h I had a very small yet integral part of my steering system break, a simple ball joint. Thankfully I managed to control the car enough to put it across someones lawn and not into on coming traffic. At 150 km/h, I would sure as hell of hit something and most likely have been killed, even at 100 km/h I would have been in a very big pile of shit.

I skydive, I fall faster than most cars can move, and those speeds, 200 km/h, don't seem ""dangerous"" or ""scary"" to me, but I know that they are not to be toyed with. In under 5 seconds you travel one km, that means in less than you reaction time you travel 300 m, can you visualize 200 m ahead all the time driving? On the experience end of skydiving some people will be coming in under canopy at 100 km/h and you need to calculate your movements 80-100 feet ahead of time or you will react to slow.

The average eye to hand reaction time is 3/4 of a second if you are prepared, this number sky rockets if you are not. This is why in drivers-ed they beat you to death with the 4 second gap rule because it also takes a large fraction of a second to translate your reaction to your car's input.

Just to further add to it, hitting a barrier at 100 km/h there is roughly 100 g's exerted onto your body, at this amount of pressure you have a 50/50 chance of surviving just the force of the vehicle stopping, death usually occurs around 26 g but a car crash is only a very brief moment. At 200 km/h you are looking upwards of 400 g which would be instant death. 150 km/h sits in the middle, you do the math.

"c5my395","You are again ignoring what physics is and again falling prey to my metal dectector story. My metal detector has not detected all the metal in the world, therefore how can I know if there is plastic.

Everytime we have spoken of something that might exist in the world that is irreducible you have said it must be a projection of the mind and not in reality at all. Thus you have regarded Morality, Self, Form, Color, Causality, Law as mere projections of individual mind and done so repeatedly and in such obviousness I could pull quotes.

Once you explain the mind by the physical the mind must necessarily cease to exist because the mind is methodilogical whatever a materialist decides he can't explain. This destroys the self, meaning, etc. Knowing more physical facts by definition cannot help you explain what you have pushed off into the realm of projection five times now. 

Intellect: “Color is by convention, sweet by convention, bitter by convention; in truth there are but atoms and the void.”

Senses: “Wretched mind, from us you are taking the evidence by which you would overthrow us? Your victory is your own fall.”

This is false modesty. You say that you are agnostic to matters of mind but you have a position. It is all projection. Atoms don't actually have natures, colors, odors, tastes or anything else. By this logic either mind is made of colorless odorless, tasteless atom and is thus an illusion (something maintained by many philosophers I regard as insane, but consistent insane bullet biters) or else mind is not entirely matter. The former is called eliminative materialism and is the honest version of what a wholly physical universe would entail. The second calls for some form of dualism. 

I hardly see how you can maintain that all is projection and maintain humility. You have positive beliefs, those beliefs have consequences that I have brought up three times but remain unanswered. If all is projection explain the sucess of mathematics, the existence of mental exprience, and the success of science. If all is projection and convention, how do we make technologies. I can answer that. We are truly discovering the hidden natures and goals of material reality and reshaping their potientals to our ends. The Humean view of Mind and Causality (what you have commited yourself to) is notoriously hard to justify with science. I've never seen it done.

You are not a data machine, you are a man and a man must make inferences about his sense data and thoughts. You have a method, mehtological physicalism, which ignores mental facts completely and assumes it doesn't exist. This is the metal detector fallacy.

"c5hkcbf","This is a kind of tangential answer but...

It comes down to the idea ""what is a right?""

We commonly think that rights are either ""god given"" or derive from our nature as humans. This is actually wrong. Rights are created and removed frequently throughout history.

For example, the right to bear arms traces it's origin to 17th century England (the times of Oliver Cromwell). This right was exported to America with the early settlers. Since then, the right to bear arms has largely been extinguished in England. The right was not god given nor did it arise from anything inherent in being human... it was created and removed by the will of government representing the people (at least ostensibly).

Another example: universal health care. In most of the world this is considered a right, but not in America (at least not yet). If it was obvious that it should be a right, then it wouldn't even be a debate, instead it would be obvious that people should have it, but it's not obvious that people should have universal health care in America, and so the solution is not obvious.


Basically, rights are created and extinguished. We only feel we have a right to something if we've had it for a while and we enjoy it's privileges. There is no ultimate source for rights. They don't come from god, they don't come from being human... they only exist because we are used to having them and would object to having them removed. They are only created when we come to expect a privilege that we have had for a while (e.g. the way universal health care is considered a right in most of the world).

American gun laws are so lenient because access to guns has always been easy in America, so restricting that access would immediately be felt by many in American society.

I might sound crazy right now and thats probably cuz I am crazy but it's true. Am I right to have these feelings? Am I being just insane and irrational? Please please be honest with me.

Like honestly never does anybody say something like ""I understand"" or ""I know how you feel"" in the context of my situation. Am I actually insane? Do I just ignore other people's help? See here's my eternal issue: I'm the one at fault for my problems. I recognize that this all happens from my doing. So obviously nobody would understand my feelings cuz my feelings do seem to be wrong. Why do I sit and complain and grope around for help when I should be doing something about it? Honestly I don't understand myself. Why do I even feel this way? Why do I insist on seeking victimhood? I cause my own problems then expect others to fix them and I get upset when they're not fixed immediately and the way that I want them to be. 

I get these insufferable mood swings. One minute I'll be happy and in a terrific mood. Then ill be shaking and nearly in tears. I feel too weak to even squeeze a stressball.

White Wolf is the head of Wakanda's black ops wing, which Black Panther disbanded when he ascended to the throne - he's the white adopted brother of T'Challa who thinks a king needs to get his hands dirty.

Man-Ape is the leader of the Panther tribes big rivals, and has been trying to steal the throne from birth. Wakanda is a lot of tribes constantly vying for dominance but has been led by the Panther tribe for a long time - they are animal cunning where the Ape Tribe is brute force.

Killmonger is a re-patriated american-borne Wakandan who built himself up from nothing to get the genius, wealth and fighting prowess of the Panther.

He runs a powerful totalitarian portion of the Wakanda (it has a state-system similar to the US where they can vary quite a lot) and is every bit Panther's equal. Panther had to crash the world economy and get himself murdered to save the country.

We know that the reapers are machines.  Machines don't build themselves so it follows that many many cycles ago -- billions of years perhaps -- there were no Reapers.

We know that the reapers don't innovate.  Part of the harvesting process is incorporating the advancements of organic civilizations into the Reapers.  

We know that Reaper intelligence is not a hive-mind like the Geth but a series of independent unshackled AIs... like EDI.  

If follows then that, at some time in the past, an organic civilization created AI -- probably more than one and that one of the AIs rebelled against them.  There was a war; the creators lost, the rebelling AI was destroyed, but one of the creators' AI's survived, presumably one that did not seek the destruction of the creators.  This is the AI that you encounter on the Citadel: the Lone Survivor of the first war between organics and synthetics.  

It mourned the loss of its creators alone... and it waited.  Perhaps it waited with a vast and galaxy spanning network of Mass Effect relays and other advanced structures at its disposal having already constructed the Reaper fleet in the war or perhaps it sat languishing in memory somewhere until it was discovered by another organic civilization.

One images that the AI watched that civilization develop or begin to develop synthetic life and, in a corruption of the Zeroth law of Robotics (more or less) acted to ""save"" them.  It crushed them and preserved them in Reaper form.  The AI went back to sleep and then, 50,000 years or so later, it happened again.

In this cycle, the AI detects what it believes to be a pattern.  Organic life inevitably gives rise to Synthetic  life and Synthetic life, unhindered, will eventually exterminate ALL organic life.  This is the fundamental motive of the Reapers because it was given to them by their creator -- the Lone Survivor -- and, it might be argued, one that Shepard and the player fundamentally CAN'T understand, either because the Lone Survivor is insane or just because the Geth and EDI seem so cuddly.  

The Lone Survivor sees itself as a guardian of organic intelligence and the endless variation and promise that intelligence can deliver but, above all, it feels that it must safeguard -- harvest -- the ultimate product of organic life: organic intelligence, even if it means destroying the civilizations that intelligence gives rise to.  The Lone Survivor is fundamentally psychotic and fundamentally insane but it can't see that because it is alone in the Universe.  It sees only the children it creates -- the Reapers -- and the civilizations it harvests and can trust neither to provide an objective assessment of its own stability.  It only knows that the organics resist its attempts to save them and that, in the end, since they will not trust it, fear and horror are more productive than spurned attempts at incorporation and cooperation and so it uses its time and endless resources to build an unfathomably powerful war machine.

But the Lone Survivor has a weakness.  It needs a place to sleep, a place to execute.  It needs vast amounts of energy, upkeep, and above all information.  

And so it is dependent upon the Citadel; that's why it lives there; that's why it executes there; and that's why it manifests to Sheppard there.  

It sees the end coming.  With each passing cycle the organics get closer and closer to uncovering the truth.  Long years have taught the AI that, despite its best intentions, the organics will not submit to its ""wisdom"" and thus, with each cycle the margin of victory is slimmer.  The AI must learn, adapt, and advance at all costs if it is to survive the inevitable hostility of the organics to their ""salvation.""

And so, when Shepard has finally secured the Citadel, overcome the indoctrinated Illusive man, and lies gasping at the controls, the AI knows that the next cycle will bring its annihilation.  It has become what it sought to prevent and, if it allows the next cycle to happen, it will be destroyed by the organic life it so feverishly worked to preserve with the knowledge that that civilization will, once again, fall before its own creations.  It can not hope to win... and so it pleads for a stalemate.  It offers Shepard the illusion of choice, two choices it knows he has already rejected and one which it ultimately seeks.  

1. Control the Reapers -- the AI has already watched Shepard reject this line of reasoning from the Illusive man.  It knows that he doesn't want that end.

2. Merge Synthetic and Organic -- the AI saw Shepard reject this line of reasoning from Sarin.  Not going to happen.

3. Destroy the Reapers, the Mass Effect Gates, and all Synthetic life.

Option three is what the AI wants. It knows it can't keep up what it's doing but it also wants to protect organic life from its own tendency to build synthetics which, it believes, will kill them.  It knows the galaxy is seeded with organic civilizations and it knows that, without Mass Effect gates, it'll be a very very long time before anyone manages some kind of meaningful trans-galactic travel.  Punching the reset button on synthetic development while simultaneously compartmentalizing the galaxy offers the best chance for organics to survive the introduction of a hostile synthetic race.

"c3zolv0","The limits weren't quite as bad as you would make them out to be. The U.S. was able to out-produce them nearly 4 to 1 in '41, 5 to 1 in '42 and '43, and then down to something like a 3.5 to 1 rate in '44 (pretty impressive since the U.S. nearly produced 100k aircraft that year). By the point they really started to amp up their aircraft production, they were limited by the amount of bauxite they could get through the silent service's screen, and, of course, the petroleum and associated lubricants that would fuel them. A real delay in the U.S. navy's ability to interdict their supply lines may have seen that aircraft production ratio whittled down even further, and of course the U.S. would still be limited in battle to the amount of carrier hangar space they could sail across the Pacific against the unsinkable aircraft carriers the Japanese could have used.

That battle could go either way since the Americans had 100-octane avgas and more powerful engine designs based on that fuel in addition to radar controlled AA guns on the non-carrier units, but still, how could you know unless it actually happened?


Regarding the reason for war, the Japanese Foreign Minister Teijiro Toyoda probably said it best on 7/31/41 (gotta love that July '41 month): *""Commercial and economic relations between Japan and third countries, led by England and the United States, are gradually becoming so horribly strained that we cannot endure it any longer. Consequently, our Empire, to save its very life, must take measures to secure the raw materials of the South Seas. Our Empire must immediately take steps to break asunder this ever-strengthening chain of encirclement which is being woven under the guidance and the participation of England and the United States, acting like a cunning dragon seemingly asleep.""* When the military high command was discussing the prospect of war, they suggested a 3 month window for completing their conquest of the south Pacific, and to voice his opposition, the Emperor quoted a nice bit of poetry written by his grandfather about the troubling aspect of constant turmoil and war, and Prince Konoye (PM) still held out hope for a diplomatic solution to the embargo issue. 

Yet on 10/2/41 the Americans officially rejected Konoye's request for a summit with Roosevelt. (which caused Tojo's ascendancy as PM) As Yergin relates in The Prize about the subsequent strategy meetings: *""From the records available it is clear that this time-oil factor hovered over the conference like a demon,"" one historian later wrote, ""A decision for war was considered the most readily available means of exorcising it.""* By 11/5/41 Tojo made a statement at another Imperial Conference in which he declared the uneasiness they felt about a protracted war, *""But how can we let the United States to continue to do as she pleases, even though there is some uneasiness? Two years from now we will have no petroleum for military use. Ships will stop moving... I fear that we would become a third-class nation after two or three years if we just sat tight.""* They made some final diplomatic demands on the issue, and when they were rejected they realized they had to either withdraw from the Asian mainland or go to war for the Dutch East Indies.

I'm not sure what you mean here?

The US has a death rate, not including suicide but including accidents, of 4.37 per 100,000 citizens whereas England has 0.008 deaths per 100,000. That's *546 times* higher in the US. Twice as many people again are injured.


&gt;he was a drugged up idiot that showed no regard for the law its lucky that he picked only a chain saw yes but if you think that criminals don't have easy access to gun already then sadly you are dam wrong. 

We're talking different things here. If gun use was more widespread, chances are he may own one or know where to access one (he certainly knew where to get a chainsaw at night) as happens in school shootings in America.


&gt; A U.S. Secret Service study of 37 school shootings in 26 states found that in nearly two-thirds of the incidents, the attacker got the gun from his or her own home or that of a relative.[source](http://www.lcav.org/statistics-polling/gun_violence_statistics.asp#f85)

Gun use is not widespread in the UK and most people will never see a gun in their lives. Most of the guns in the hands of criminals are blanks smuggled in from abroad  -- there is nothing we can ever do to stop that - which have been converted and luckily are prone to misfire. Yes, where there's a will there's a way, but arming the populance is not the answer because it's not not criminals with guns that we should be afraid of - it's everyone.


[In 1997](http://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=homicide+statisitcs+uk&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CCsQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.parliament.uk%2Fcommons%2Flib%2Fresearch%2Frp99%2Frp99-056.pdf&amp;ei=0R83T-zaFs-g8gPbq7m-Ag&amp;usg=AFQjCNGw7_EPxdRYxqMqFIXIlqyGikqazQ&amp;sig2=8n-RzXATnEJq2roY5mNIig) (page 17) 68% of female homicides and 21% of male homicides the aggressor was the spouse / lover or a family member. This is what worries me - perfectly normal people who just flip out.

[This is an interesting website](http://www.lcav.org/statistics-polling/gun_violence_statistics.asp) - some choice quotes (references on the page) include:


&gt; Abused women are five times more likely to be killed by their abuser if the abuser owns a firearm.

&gt; Domestic violence assaults involving a firearm are 23 times more likely to result in death than those involving other weapons or bodily force.

&gt; A recent survey of female domestic violence shelter residents in California found that.. in nearly two thirds (64.5%) of the households that contained a firearm, the intimate partner had used the firearm against the victim, usually threatening to shoot or kill the victim.

&gt; Children and young adults (24 years of age and under) constitute over 41% of all firearm deaths and non-fatal injuries.


If you're afraid of your safety you might want to consider pepper spray or even tasers before you go down the gun route.

&gt; if this was a corner-shop, a take way even the pub when it was dead you could be looking at a blood bath this only want as there were multiple patrons able to distract an attack from all directions with chairs.


And if the perp had gotten his hands on a gun, it would have been a bloodbath. In all honesty it doesn't look like his aim here was to actually kill - he was crazy and insane but it seems more that he was threatening and trying to prove a point than actually kill anyone. 

Anyway, I'll leave you with this: if we flood the country with guns (there are 90 guns per 100 people in America) there is no reversal.

"c3ivsg6","Eh, I may be mixing things up between belief systems. No self = pure life experiencing itself. Discovering no self = eradicating the ego which creates a ""safe"" psychological box that composes our view of the world and how we interact with it.

There is no I there. :) I am looking at some almost insane but interesting ramblings on the topic here: http://ruthlesstruthdotcom.blogspot.com/2010/10/thunder-and-sunshine.html

For the concept of ""nothing actually exists""... this is also about ""thoughts thinking themselves"". Why the hell should that happen? But in that regard why should any organization of matter be able to create thoughts? Add to that the fact that the matter is continually changing, brain cells dying, nutrients going in, waste coming out, atoms continually being replaced, etc. Despite all that we remain ourselves. There has to be an underlying principle there, if only we can discover it.

For the questions that don't have answers.... it all depends on the context. People with synesthesia can experience numbers as colors or emotions or other strange effects. A rock's temperament? Perhaps there is something there to be experienced that we cannot because of our narrow view of the world. It may be that asking nonsensical questions can trigger areas of creativity in ourselves that is otherwise not experienced. In our dreams one view of interpretation is that everything we see or experience is symbolic of some portion of ourselves. Some cultures have the belief that viewing the waking state *in the exact same manner* (ie: more dream symbolism) can help them understand process and cope with their life in a much better and more real fashion.

We have the belief that we are separate from everything else, we are sentient and have self awareness and can think and everything else is not, somehow life/thoughts arose in the magic of our brain wiring, but not in everything else that experiences chemical reactions and electron transfers cannot ""think"".

It may be a better view that everything is alive, every type of organization of matter, everything is sentient, everything thinks, everything reacts to desires, just that the perceptions and desires are different from thing to thing and we cannot understand them. And yes, we know this is true in some ways for everything. We can see this behavior in atoms, cells, animals and so forth. We assume that there actions are ""mechanical"", that they have no perceived ""self"" but that does not have to be the case. 

So why do thoughts arise in matter? Are they are property of brain cells? Or of matter itself? The brain can be said to access memory banks. It also has a subconscious. Why don't animals exhibit subconscious behavior? (ie: repressed/conflicting behavior) Maybe other types of things have thoughts, but they don't have memories or emotions.

How about instead of going back to the world we just spent 200 hours in a couple years ago, we do something new and exciting that actually makes sense and follows the Skyrim plot.  What reason would we even possibly have for going to one of those places?  Cyrodiil was attacked by the Thalmor and had most of it's cities damaged, but besides that nothing has really happened there.  There is no lore reason for the dungeons to be different or actually interesting, and as that is what made Skyrim so much better, Cyrodiil is going to suck in comparison.  I'm not a writer or anything but I can easily come up with a dozen or so awesome DLC ideas that beat the shit out of going to Cyrodiil again.  How about something like... an expedition uncovers some bigass Dwemer city thing underground with some powerful shit in it so the Thalmor move in to take it for themselves so you as the Dragonborn need to ally yourself with the dragons and stop them.

Beginners shouldn't be using casts.  In C and in older versions of Java casts are a fact of life.  C++ rarely requires casts, certainly never in a first-year course.

&gt; multiple inheritance rules

Multiple inheritance is a boogey man.  People overuse inheritance.  That said slicing isn't exactly beginner friendly.

&gt; public/private/friend/static etc

Declare your types with the ""struct"" keyword and everything is public.  Forget about all of that stuff until you get to a software engineering course.

&gt; the entire template system

What's the alternative?  Rolling your own for everything?  Lack static type checking?  Templates are very beginner friendly (except for the error messages).  Yes templates can get complicated but in a first course you would simply be using them, not creating them.  That would be saved until a data structures and algorithms course.

&gt; manual memory management

Just leak the memory, seriously.  The OS will clean it up when the process goes.  Most newb programs end shortly after reaching maximum memory usage.  Later they can be taught about RAII and all that.

Things that actually make it hard to teach C++: header files, pointer syntax (pointer semantics also... but that is something that needs to be learned), std::string vs c_string (and why string literals aren't strings), why you can't return local variables, and arrays.

Scheme is atrocious.  I can't believe that anyone seriously would advocate it.  The lack of syntax means that there is nothing for the mind to grab onto.  You are dealing with pointers essentially from the beginning (cons cells are pairs of pointers) and the lack of static typing is madness.  Most people, even most smart people, do not think in terms of functional programming.  People anthropomorphize the computer, and thus they want to give it commands.

"c2l114j","South of San Francisco things get very staid.  There is nascent night life around Palo Alto and Mountain View, but it gets quiet early.  San Francisco really has the night life, though there is some stuff going on in Oakland and San Jose also.  In San Jose most of the action is around downtown and the South First Street Area by SJSU.  There is a lively underground house party scene that is worth checking out, but you really have to ask around to get in to the best parties.

Housing is a huge issue in the area.  Be prepared to have proof of employment and references and a wad of cash and good speed to get into good places.  Around $1000 might get you a crappy and noisy studio.  Average rent in the area is $1750/mo.  Often the best deal is to get together with at least one other similar person and rent a house to share.  Commuting at normal times can get insane, but most employers accept some flexibility to schedules.

As far as banking the big banks have issues, Bank of America has a nasty reputation and I wouldn't do business with them.  Credit unions and local banks are all good, and First Republic Bank also has a really good reputation for good service and zero BS.

There are an interesting bunch of independent ISPs in the area, so it is really worth looking into that in detail.  The big providers may seem to be the only option, but there are some smaller local players.

Having known some Canadians around I would say that you should be prepared for nice weather and good times and good opportunities, but also wary of the down sides.

"c2eqrmz","&gt;DRM affects a very small percentage of the people who buy the game.

Demanding a constant connection while playing has screwed me over many times, personally. Games For Windows Live doesn't allow you to save if you aren't connected to the net, and guess what happened when I found I didn't have a connection? A few hours I needed to replay.

By the way, you know Origin? That not only requires a connection, it also requires allowing EA to scan your hard drive and access your net history, and build up a personal profile on you to sell to third parties. By the way, it says nothing about giving anonymity when they do so, too (yes, I'm serious, it's insane but true).

Apparently Origin will be required to play all EA games released henceforth, even if you buy retail. So, do you want to play Mass Effect 3, with a mouse? There goes your privacy. Or you could pirate, I suppose.

Is ***that*** enough to justify getting a lower score? Maybe you don't care about privacy (not to say you don't), but some people don't care about graphical glitches, should the games be rated without factoring in those glitches?

"c2eqb6f","While you certainly have a few good points here, I think a few can be debunked!

Firstly - falling for the egg face trick. The facehuggers are sneaky bastards... they almost get Ripley and Newt when Burke releases them in Aliens. It isn't so much ""falling for the trick"" as it is ""hey, this unsuspecting population just had a bunch of facehuggers launched at it!"" What you're not expecting, you can't prepare for. This is how terrorism and guerrila warfare work.

You're right, Xenomorphs do lack ranged combat. It isn't really a plot hole when your film is set in a complex with tight corridors and crawlspaces, but they do address it in the director's cut. The marines have (very effective) auto-turrets! the problem is, eventually you run out of bullets.

Again, you're right about the xenomorph being ""fuck gigantic"" (excellent wording, by the way). Technically, it was loose in the refinery the ship was hauling behind it, which makes it slightly less pointless giant and insane, but thats a minor point.

Xenomorphs do violate the law of conservation of mass on screen - however there is a deleted scene from the first film where they come across a (giant) crate of food that has been consumed by said alien - so at the very least, the Ridley Scott was thinking about this issue, even if he ultimately decided not to address it.

I do not think the Xenomorph had magical in depth knowledge of human anatomy - it is more an inate ability that could apply to any species - think of the Space Jockey in the first film, for example. Perhaps *Prometheus* will explain this further. I think you're stretching a bit on this point, though... parasites know how to opperate in various hosts - it is their nature. Plus, we need to keep in mind the violent rape immagery that H.R. Geiger et al were going for when designing these creatures.

Turning the patient upside down seems pretty airtight. The only debunkery I can think of here is the short reference in Aliens that says the patients die when facehuggers are removed. Maybe removing the tube that goes down the victim's throat to lay the egg in the chest prevents saving the patient? Pure conjecture, of course.

In the first film, the facehugger is said to provide for the air needs of the vicim.

Standard horror movie cliches are unavoidable. But, these are movies! if it was real life, it wouldn't be nearly as entertaining to get so frustrated at everything that is going on.

"c2ddlao","North Korea is much too dogmatic to be called an ""atheist state"". If anything, it is a necrocracy where Kim Il-sung (the dead guy) is the Eternal President and Kim Jong-Il (his son) is essentially his prophet. 

What you are really getting at (I think) is that dogmatic and uncritical thinking leads to abuses. Many times this dogma is religiously based, and it is certainly in religion that people *respect* this type of dogma. Few people respect North Korea because it is clearly insane, but many people respect mainstream religions even when they do similar things (Homophobia and intimidation, rape of children, disowning of children who do not conform to their parents religion, etc.) These abuses are directly religiously motivated, and it is likely that they would go away were religion to disappear. Certainly removing religion wouldn't get rid of all the problems of the world, but neither would curing cancer get rid of all diseases. This doesn't mean that curing cancer isn't a noble goal.

"c26p4hu","As Obsidian is likely busy doing one a more pertinent activity, I will leave my questions to any of you willing to answer them, or able to see them. I'm a new DM. Well, relatively new. See, I've played in two groups prior to the I'm DMing now. Those went smoothly and gave me an efficient comprehension of 4.0 and 3.5, though I'm hardly an expert. Then I tried DMing my own group. It... well. I wish my DM virginity wasn't lost with them, let me say. They were all my friends, and they are all people who pick up things like this rather quickly. I naively assumed it would go well. It didn't. It was a group of six loud, hyperactive teenagers, all older than me, in a social group that already had preset 'leaders' and 'followers', and as it turned out, I was not viewed as the leader. So, it was three sessions of people not paying the slightest bit of attention, being flippant and rude, and disrespecting the game entirely. We got through two encounters, when my brother (a veteran player who stepped in to fill in as a Warden tank when one of the regulars was gone) informed me, quite bluntly, that regardless of these being my friends, they were not people to play D&amp;D with. So I dropped them.

I've recently reformed a new group with four members. They are all calm, laid back people who can responsibly and efficiently meet in one place at one time. I've had one session with them so far, and it went splendidly. We got two solid encounters finished, as well as several basic skill challenges. I was pleased (although it did devolve into zany shenanigans in the last 30 minutes, due to two players being incredibly tired and having no inhibitions), but I felt like I was balancing on a tightrope. It felt as though if they did one unexpected action, or they rolled a little too well, the entire session would topple over into disaster. So, here are my questions.

1. What are some tips about making a tough, challenging encounter that won't bend the party over a table and have its way with them? Things like basic layouts and formats that I can fill in with appropriately leveled creatures.

2. How do I engage a player who is very laid back, responsible, and constructive, but doesn't have much character depth? His character is a humorous one, but one lacking too much in thought (Lawful Evil Tiefling Invoker), as this is his first time playing D&amp;D, and he's not much of a lore/story enthusiast like the rest of the group is. 

3. One of my players runs a Dwarf Warden named Ser Frumpsalot (nicknamed Ser Frumpy, or just Frumpy), who speaks in a voice that resembles Scruffy the Janitor from Futurama, is covered in a supernatural, almost quasi-intelligent filth layer that makes everything he touches stinky, as well as dressed in leather armor made of the hides of every rodent he's ever killed (and subsequently eaten), and wields a shield made out of a giant cog wheel, and a massive blacksmith hammer, making him a rather... well, frumpy fellow. His character is a senile, insane, but altogether noble hermit who holds the persona of a chivalrous knight (wildly placing most people under his protection and then going to any end to safeguard their existence). This touches on two points, one of which I will hit next. See, this player, among the group, is well-respected and looked up to, as a veteran who the new players can learn from. His characters are usually humorous, but well thought out and deeper than they appear. They also have a certain amount of charisma that makes the party want to sit back, get complacent and just be side characters in HIS story. He is by no means attention mongering, but his characters tend to put everyone else in the background, whether he wants it or not. How best should I balance it out and keep everyone else on equal playing fields of personality?

4. This same player, as I mentioned, plays a chivalrous, fearless character. There has already been a situation so far, where he confronted and tried to kill a larger villain who has a purpose later. In combat, the villain would crush him, and they only just rolled their characters. His character would not back down and put himself in danger. So, I pulled a fast one and got them out of there without conflict. What worries me the most, is that I've been in a campaign like this. The DM is a writer, and a good one at that, but he creates this grand story, full of fleshed out NPCs with great character/backstory/etc., and constantly makes it impossible for the characters to ever win against a character he's designated to some seat of invulnerability, because if they get hurt, his story is hurt. It makes the players feel like sidekicks to the NPCs. So, I ask. Is it better to rail your campaign for the purpose of the greater story, or to allow your story to get completely decimated to preserve true freedom? Or, even still, should a campaign be railed about certain things, but flexible with most others?

5. What are some tips to make the rules of the game more interesting? (Some unique house rules, per say)

6. How do I reward PCs and make their character feel unique and theirs, but keep things balanced? (Ex: unique gear/rewards/curses/blessings)

7. Should I eventually give each and every PC a mission involving their back story?

8. How often should I punish a player in game, and for what, if anything?

The chances that a bipedal mammal could have evolved to the level where it can actually leave the earths atmosphere or perform brain surgery is mind blowing. The fact that when we talk to each other and feel and perceive the beautifully complex world around us, there was a  chance none of this might have been.

Interestingly, although the mechanism is whack, the idea itself isn't that bad; iron overload is clearly bad: we know what happens to those with idiopathic hemochromatosis, and it's not good. The solution is easy enough: get some blood taken out now and again. The same mechanism may be why pre-menopausal women don't have the heart disease risk of age-matched men, but they quickly catch up after menopause.

However, now that humans don't fight (and bleed) quite so much anymore, and that we're now virtually devoid of endoparasites, the iron in the blood doesn't ""turn over"" quite so much. This may in part be responsible for some heart disease that we see.

"c1iet2s","A. Sometimes you need to humor your players most sarcastic remarks...  You'll never know what will happen...

Custom world, custom system:  Post-Post Apocalyptic realm.  The group is in Agar, a town built around the remains of the most intact biodome.  Hence, there is great academic interest in the massive biodome and the town is like a college burg.  The squad had just arrived after their vehicle ran over a large piece of rock infested by a particular variety of extra-dimensional bacteria that likes to absorb thermal and light energy... and release it in a kinetic burst when enough shock force is applied.  The rock had been sitting out in the desert for years.  The vehicle that ran over it could be likened to the lovechild between an Oshkosh HEMTT and Winnebago.  It took them an hour to find where the wheel assembly got launched to.

So after getting the vehicle in the shop, the team left to explore the town.  After seeing some of the sights and getting the basic supplies.  They were a little bored, someone in the party asked, ""Do they have an arcade around here?""

The simple answer would be ""No.""  But...  This is where the mark of a good DM is...  I thought about it momentarily.  There is enough tech in the town... filled by many college aged students... who are bored in the middle of the wastes.

""Yes... There is an arcade.""

""Does it have skee-ball?""

What kind of arcade of any quality DOESN'T have skee-ball, ""Yes.""

So... the wasteland dwelling woman with little self-regard and a fatal attraction to study and capture the aforementioned extra-dimensional bacteria, the half-human, half-mammalian cocktail linguistics and cultural expert, and the self-sufficient, 7""+ robotic AI being created by a distributed, larger AI armed with a FF7 Cloud sword....  wander off for a bit to play skeeball at the arcade.  Turns out through strange luck of the rolls, that the metal man is a skeeball natural.  Even after he stopped pitching the skeeballs in like basketballs and used the ramp.  After the session was over, along with all the other rewards, I granted the metal man a skill tweak to throwing spheroid objects, because of strange natural ability he demonstrated.  This came in handy later on in the campaign.

B.  Don't keep strict plans... better to keep a good outline and a flexible itinerary.

When running a campaign, stick with an outline, a few big ventures, and a few interchangeable side deals.  Players need to drive the game.  No one likes to feel forced.  Quite simply, you need to be ready for players to take one look down a hallway and say, ""Fuck that, we're going home.""  And sometimes, be ready for the players to find the loopholes...

Same group of adventurers were in a town plagued by 3ft tall thieving, annoying critters.  The town doesn't shoot them, since it seems another takes it's place the next day... or another strange monstrosity begins to inhabit the forests around the town.  There's rumors of an old research center hidden in the hills.  The people have been trying to map a safe route, but they got to a point they hadn't figured out a safe way through.  Why?  Around the property surrounding the base are still active defense turrets.  The party was interested in what was still inside and charged forth after getting all the information they could.  They finally reached a point they could not easily pass through.  There was a turret scanning the open area they needed to get through.  

A few ideas were had.  They decided to test the capabilities of the system and started hurling various combinations of rocks to figure out it's targeting preferences and power.  They were getting close to figuring it out when the metal man had an idea.

""How long does it take to do a scan of the area?""

""About 30 seconds.""

""How far away is it?""

""150 meters, up a 45 degree incline.""

""How fast can I run?""

He had maxed out Strength and Agility and Endurance.  ""You could do the 100 meter dash in 10 seconds on a good day.""

A grin on his face. ""I wait till it scans over the further field and charge it.""

He's going to blind-side rush a defense turret mounted on a 15 meter pole?  Oh hell.  ""Start rolling Athletics and give the numbers.""

So a recap.  Metal Man is blind-side rushing defense turret...  Doing a complete Leroy Jenkins on the party's plans.  The super mechanic husband of the extra-dimensional bacteria fanatic, piggy backs on the metal man's back at the request of the runner.  The rolls are made.  All pass, sometimes barely.   They get right under the turret.  By design... it cannot target directly underneath it to avoid accidental damages to itself.  After super-mechanic runs into some issues deactivating the device, metal man has another idea.  Wielding his Cloud sword and ridiculous strength...  He proceeds to Paul Bunion the turret (barely missing the massive power cable) and fells it like a Christmas tree.

""Well..."", I thought, ""that's one way to do it.  Good job.""

""Hey...  I bet we could use these on the vehicle!""

Oh shit.  Hmm, they have to haul them out of there somehow!  ""Well, this equipment is pretty heavy and not easily moved.""

From the group, another player, ""My bot could easily carry them!""

Oh, yeah.  Another member of this party is afflicted with a prototype nano-adaptation system that allows him to ""by feel and touch"" manipulate various electronics, devices, and himself...  In a previous boss fight, he linked up to the remote control system of the brother bot to a berserk bot.  The nanites are weird about how they non-technically translate things.  They ended up pulling an Avatar and he became the brother bot.   Long story short...  He wrestled the berserk bot to keep it busy, nearly incinerated a few party members, and they worked together to bring the berserk bot down.

...  They kept the fucking brother bot.  In fact, they got its own goddamn trailer to house it in for their party vehicle.  But, they'll need it soon enough.

Also, they decide to successfully, despite me increasing the difficulty, taking down another turret.  Hauled the two turrets and power/control modules back to the party vehicle... AND THEN... decided to go in the base.  I made sure the parking garbage was the only area accessible by the BFR (big fuckin' robot).



Later down inside...  They were near the Big Overtly Scary Sonuvabitch of the base.  A heavily mutated creature that's primary food source turned out to be freshly cloned town critters, that weren't fast enough to make the exit, being made to replace those killed in the field by an automated process that had never received the quit command.  The party saw the thing, looked at each other, and collectively said... ""Fuck that, we're outta here.""   They went down to the maintenance level below, killed the power to the cloning machine, laid a nasty trap in the only route out of the area, and left to the town.  They reported the cloning machine that had been producing the annoying creatures had been stopped.  They didn't see a single critter the next day.

C.  Quirks are the spice of life.  It's bland when there is none, but some people can't handle too much spice.  You need to decide your safe level.

The group running my homebrew stuff are a strange lot:

1.  Super-Mechanic, owner and driver of party vehicle, waste land dweller who fancies himself a sniper in training.

2.  Extra-dimensional bacteria fanatic/collector with a serious lack of sense who's married to the driver.

3.  Linguistics and old/new cultural expert half-human, half-mammalian mix who tends to receive all the cheap jokes...  The party would be wise not to piss off the translator telling them what the signs with colorful striping mean.

4.  Independent robotic AI who under-going a bit of ego war with something trying to move into his psyche.  It doesn't help he's the one carrying the huge sword.

5.  A sarcastic, prototype nano-system infested human who currently trying all kind of dangerous behavior with the barely understood nano-system inside him.  Recent achievements include:  powering various dead computer systems, trying to assimilate 200+ year old implants taken from a rotted, tube-sealed dead man, and painfully willing the construction of physical structures to attach a cybernetic limb, found left over in some lab, to his body.  Yes, he has three limbs.  The entire party is weirded out when he uses the third hand.

6.  A mutant lady specializing in a shotgun and carrying a tackle box of various shells.  She also can get brief glimpses into the past or future around places of significance.

7.  Another mutant with the ability to temporarily phase-out of sync, pass through walls, and phase-in.  Armed with twin pistols, and a heavy preference for ""iron diplomacy"".  

""Iron Diplomacy"" in action...

Captive: ""I won't tell you anything!""

Mr. Diplomacy turns and shoots another captive square in the head without blinking.

Captive: ""I will tell you EVERYTHING!""

"c1ied5j","my dad was in the Khmer Rouge genocide as a young boy. There is no way to fully convey how awesome he is in words, but the most I can say is that he is completely insane and completely awesome. 


For example, when I bring my bf over to visit (when I 1st brought him to visit my dad he was scared shitless some shit was gonna go down and I honestly didn't know lol) my dad threatens to cut his dick off about 40 times per visit but my bf absolutely loves him to death (and my dad loves him almost more than me).


I should also mention that my dad has permanent brain damage that only happened recently and he has a very short memory (just like Memento) as a result which is really interesting to see how he makes sense of his current situation (living in a nursing home).


People always think I must have crazy daddy issues but as fate would have it I have only had contact with him very sporadically. And every time he saw me he was incredibly overjoyed and wouldn't let me leave.

"c1i1rmu","wow...shes a bitch.

it sounds to me like she got to you at a very young age and really made you feel worthless at times.  even if you understand what what she said was stupid and insane, its sometimes still hard to shake the feeling if she was able to get to you at a young age (under 20).  

the reason she is like this is (most likely) because someone did it to her.  she has insecurities about who she is and feels like a failure.  i know that hearing that probably doesn't suddenly make you feel better (or maybe it does), but i feel like it helps to understand why people treated you the way they did.  it isn't normally your fault.

my best advice to you is to continue to try and do good in school, but put your happiness first.  in my opinion, thats all that really matters.   now, dont fool this for ""be irresponsible.""  sometimes, putting up with crap (like a job you dont like) helps do things like pay for rent, food, movies, etc etc.  be happy, but keep the future in mind.  work hard towards things YOU want. 

but dont beat yourself up over failures.  for example, im terrible at history and i didnt get a single A through university on history (of which i was required to take 5 miserable classes).  i even failed one (i blame the fact that the teacher was totally insane...not like laugh at her insane, but she would laugh even when it didnt make sense and everyone was terrified of her; like seriously fucking detached from reality insane).  was that my fault?  i really dont feel guilty.  i wish i hadnt taken the class ever, but if i could go back, things would probably be the same.

sorry, difted off, my point was: you are human.  humans make mistakes.  if you focus on ""man, i messed up, i wish that hadnt happened, things would be so much better if that hadnt happened""... change your thoughts more towards ""how can i learn from this?  if i could go back in time, would i do it again?""  accept who you are and focus on improving who you already are.  if you focus on who you want to be, youll forget to look at yourself in your current state sometimes.

to give another example from my life, i just bought a ""special edition"" of a video game recently for a lot of money.  after opening it and seeing whats inside that made it so ""special"" i really kind of feel like i wasted my money.  BUT, on the other hand, im supporting a group of game developers that i really like.  i like being able to play their games and what to support them anyway i can.  so even if the material value wasn't worth it, ive logiced my way into feeling like it was worth it.  (tip: i want to be a game developer myself so supporting the industry is wise on my part)

and remember, reddit is always here to chat =]",1298497161,"wow...shes a bitch.  it sounds to me like she got to you at a very young age and really made you feel worthless at times.  even if you understand what what she said was stupid and insane, its sometimes still hard to shake the feeling if she was able to get to you at a young age (under 20).    the reason she is like this is (most likely) because someone did it to her.  she has insecurities about who she is and feels like a failure.  i know that hearing that probably doesn't suddenly make you feel better (or maybe it does), but i feel like it helps to understand why people treated you the way they did.  it isn't normally your fault.  my best advice to you is to continue to try and do good in school, but put your happiness first.  in my opinion, thats all that really matters.   now, dont fool this for ""be irresponsible.""  sometimes, putting up with crap (like a job you dont like) helps do things like pay for rent, food, movies, etc etc.  be happy, but keep the future in mind.  work hard towards things you want.   but dont beat yourself up over failures.  for example, im terrible at history and i didnt get a single a through university on history (of which i was required to take 5 miserable classes).  i even failed one (i blame the fact that the teacher was totally insane...not like laugh at her insane, but she would laugh even when it didnt make sense and everyone was terrified of her; like seriously fucking detached from reality insane).  was that my fault?","stupid and insane","insane",NA,FALSE,"stupid and insane","stupid",NA,NA,0

Edit: Here it is...not insane, but quite strange.
So last night I met this girl for a drink, got her number while I was in work the other week, had no prior connections to her or her friends, total 'get to know you' situation.
So we're at this bar having a couple of drinks, we're chatting about the usual shit.... the city, travel, work etc. Then I get asked ""So when's the last time you had sex?"" Now I'm all for openness and honesty so I tell her that it was a few months ago in a dirty break up with my ex girlfriend, and don't elaborate as I don't want to drop a depression bombshell into the conversation then she says that for her it has been...""MONTHS"". How exactly would you take this? OK, after this shes reacting a bit weird to some of my questions, says she doesnt believe I'm being 'genuine', which I don't exactly see how I'm not being. But goes on to state that I'm really ""Doing very well"".
THEN she gets up to go to the restroom, and I'm sitting there for about 15 minutes when the guy next to me at the bar says he thinks he saw the girl I was with leave via the side door. A fucking catastrophic end to an evening you might assume... but not whenever she left her handbag including phone wallet etc and her coat on the chair beside me.
To be honest I'm worried about her as well as not having a clue what the hell to make of the psychology of the first date! The bar kept her shit so she'll hopefully get it back shortly. I'm just very confused!!

Update: After me calling her cell a few times throughout the day, she texts as asks me 'Where did you go last night?!""......WHAT?! I replied and explained how she'd left me and I waited for a good while at the bar, but glad she was ok and got her stuff back. She replied ""Wow, I'm so so sorry, I must do crazy things when I've been drinking!"" Then went on to be very apologetic in the rest of our text conversation, and invite me to head out with her again.

"c1d4u4d","I've been living in France since September and I just spent a week in Paris with my boyfriend. It was my first time there and it was incredible! 

In case you haven't gotten lodging yet, check out airbnb.com. It's more affordable than most hotels and a million times nicer than a hostel. Plus, you get breakfast.

As far as places to eat...
1. L'as du Falafel near Ile de la Cite is famous for its street food (falafel kebab and schwarma) and for good reason! It was amazing. 
2. Refuge des Fondues near Mont Martre and Sacre Coeur. Sacre Coeur is best seen at night in my opinion. The crowds are way less intense. This restaurant is amazing - you pay 18 euro per person for an appetizer plate, cheese fondue (gotta pay a bit extra for beef), and a baby bottle (yes, a baby bottle) or either red or white wine and then fruit salad for dessert. It's also open til 2am most nights which is awesome!
3. Leon de Bruxelles. I went to the Champs Elysees location for some great Moules Frites (mussels and french fries)!
4. Pho 14 - if you like pho, definitely check this out. DO NOT go to nearby restaurants because Pho 14 is too busy because those other restaurants have awful tasting pho.

Places to visit:
1. Go up to the top (all the way to the top) of the Tour Eiffel. We did it at night and it was BEAUTIFUL! We walked our way down which was really cool.
2. Arc de Triomphe. If you're on the Champs Elysees anyway, definitely check this out. It's really cool to see!
3. Versailles. Cool day trip. If I'm not mistaken, closed on Mondays which makes Tuesdays super busy...that's when we went and it was insane, but very cool!
4. Notre Dame / Saint Chapelle. Go on a clear day so you can see Saint Chapelle's beautiful stained glass windows.
5. Sacre Coeur. I liked this more than Notre Dame, though both were beautiful. Beware, there are a lot of stairs involved though there is a tram available. Not sure how late the tram runs, though.
6. Check out neweuropetours.eu. They offer free walking tours around Paris and all you have to do is tip at the end, nothing substantial. We did these tours all over Europe and they were fun and interesting. You can check tons of sights off your list and you won't get lost! Wear good shoes!

I was underwhelmed by the Musée d'Orsay, which I really wanted to love but just...didn't. The Louvre was enjoyable but be sure to allot enough time to see it!

Enjoy every moment and don't be afraid of the metro! They have 3 and 5 day discovery passes available that aren't that expensive and make traveling a lot easier. We took the metro at all times of the day with no problem. Bon courage!

"c1afo77","The NFL is sort of the culmination of the best of the best. The players who enter the NFL have already been playing football for years and years both in high school and college. Many have been playing since grade school! College football in the USA is really at the level of a professional sport. The players don't get paid, but there is an ungodly amount of money in it for the schools. 

There are several different divisions of college football. What you see most of the time is ""NCAA division I"", but there are hundreds of other schools which make up ""division II"", ""division III"", the NAIA, and so on. For whatever reason, conference realignment and the addition of new teams is much more likely in college football. The NFL is thankfully pretty static in terms of divisions, conferences, and number of teams. I think the current structure is perfect.

The NFL draft is this very bizarre trumped-up (and televised!) ritual which happens every spring. The players don't have to go to college, but they have to be out of high school for two full years before they are eligible for the draft. Kids can therefore enter the draft before they finish college, or with no college, but the most typical scenario has them finishing college. The only other requirement is that they sign with an agent. College is valuable training as far as NFL teams are concerned. They like to see players succeeding under the huge pressures of the college game in a reliable way before taking a monetary risk on them. All the scouts for the teams get to see all the draft enrolled players work out at something called ""the NFL combine"" before the draft. It's a bit like watching horses before a race, or looking over items before an auction. The draftees run drills and try to impress the scouts. Of course this is because being a higher draft pick usually means getting a bigger contract. Occasionally, a player will get drafted by a team he does not wish to play for. He can then become a ""holdout"" until the situation is resolved. This reflects badly on the player and the team so to avoid this the teams pretty much always talk to the players and their agents before they draft them. Therefore, draft day for many players coming out of college means sitting around by the phone waiting for a team to call. The amount of speculation which surrounds the NFL draft is comical and insane, but for most of these players getting into the NFL is the reward for years and years of hard work.

1) Arriving on a tourist visa and spending that time looking for a sponsor (don't bring any physical documents with you that may suggest this is your intention - you can get turned around at the border for having a resume!).

"c16dpc5","""How about prosecuting her after the first case?""

That was the issue I was trying to address. Setting a precedent for prosecuting women who accuse a man of rape and end up losing the case (that is what is happening at this point) can easily be problematic. What happens if this person was actually raped, and the system simply failed to find this accused man guilty? Then the rape victim is now being accused of a crime herself, which is insane. But in this particular case, of course, it is easy to look at this woman who has falsely accused 8 men of rape and to call her insane and reprehensible. This is clearly an extreme case of the central problem at hand, which is what to do with those who falsely accuse people, and how to tell the different between them and those whom the legal system has failed.

"c10x7x4","I think we can make some kind of small improvement now.  I believe small improvements are always available.  But let's take something like the attitude of the bosses and business owners toward the employees.  Can that be changed in a way that will make people sigh a sigh of relief now?  No way.  The culture of ownership is so deeply ingrained.  Once I believe I own property, if I hire you, I believe I own your time, which means I believe I own your soul for some duration.  This is fucking insane, but true.  Of course the ream me doesn't believe that.  That was a hypothetical ""I"".  This attitude is so ingrained that from small businesses like restaurants, all the way to the biggest businesses, even places like Googe, that attitude will rule the day and will make itself felt either very overtly or perhaps more subtly to the employees.

Just look at the language itself: boss, employee, owner... what does this language connote?

Compare and contrast: ally, co-conspirator, colleague, collaborator, worker, coworker

Feel the difference between worker vs employee.  Or even collaborator vs worker.

If you don't think any of this stuff affects our psyche and down the line affects how we behave, think again.

So I do believe in change, but I don't think amazing change is possible all at once.  I think the amazing change will be gradual and it won't feel amazing at any one point in time.

Most of the times people think about what they don't currently like.  Very few people spend serious effort envisioning something they *would* like.  Most attention is focused negatively on stuff we know we want to get rid of or stop.

&gt;and implement that answer?

Part of the reason is because we don't know what to implement for the above reason.  And part of the reason is because if we envision something truly ass kicking, we will realize how many cultural assumptions are holding us back.  People are so used to the master-slave relationship.

"c0yljhf","Wow... slightly humbling/humanizing to be commenting on one of *your* posts.  Particularly one so serious, but I don't think you'd post otherwise.  So here it goes...

&gt;  It turns out that my ex-wife is bipolar. Her psychiatrist is confident that he can get her condition under control, but I think it's too early for him to reach that conclusion. She wants to know if I would be willing to drop the divorce proceedings; she says that she was lying when she said that she had cheated on me, and wants me back.

Ok... as soon as you mention the ""B"" word, you have to realize that everything and anything that comes out of her mouth is immediately suspect.  Bi-polar people that aren't managing their condition can create very elaborate and convincing fantasies, that even they believe themselves, for the purpose of manipulation.

There was a bi-polar woman on here earlier that was telling us that she was ""better now"" and I was highly skeptical.  Thirty days ago your wife was either giving you a fantasy for the purpose of manipulation, or she did just now.  In either case, I don't believe a word that comes out of a bi-polar person until they've been under successful treatment for *years.*  The capacity for psychopathic manipulation is so strong that ""normal"" people such as ourselves cannot even fully comprehend it.  It's like cthulhu, you'd go mad if you could understand it.

Anyway - telling you that the cheating was a lie is part of the manipulation process.  Even if it *was* a lie, she's still trying to manipulate you by dropping that bomb on you now, with the lawyers present and psychiatrist getting on you and everything.  I've seen bi-polar people *managing their psychiatrist* for the purposes of manipulation before.  Is the psychiatrist new?  Maybe s/he is in the picture strictly *for* the purposes of manipulation.  

""Oh, shit... I've been busted.  Let me get a psychiatrist and 'seek' help so I can get what I want here.""

Maybe that's too conspiracy theorist, but I've seen worse.  And crazier.  Reality *is* stranger than fiction.

Again, the reason why they're so convincing is because they believe the story themselves.  She may actually believe that the cheating was a lie at this point, but in reality it happened.  You just don't know.

What I don't get is the bi-polar pattern of 1) do some **insane** shit to *force* your SO to dump you to protect their own life and get a restraining order put out on yourself, then 2) do some equally insane but positive shit to turn it all around and put herculean efforts into getting your SO back in spite of all logic and reason, just before repeating the whole process 6 months later.  It's way more than just having extreme highs and lows - there's a real force behind it and it's damn near always the same.

&gt;  But I've spent ten years with this woman, and despite all of my tough talk in /r/relationship_advice I can't bring myself to say the two words she deserves to hear after what she has done to me. I told her that I needed time to think.

"c0q8cnr","This presents an interesting challenge to me; usually I like the gritty, complicated, monstrous stuff rather than the lighthearted and heartwarming, but let's see...

Here are five that might suit your purpose (in no particular order):

1. Jerome K. Jerome - *Three Men in a Boat*: A pleasing novel about the adventures of three friends traveling along the Thames with their dog in a small boat.  Frequently hilarious and absurd, but always somewhat beautiful.  This is a book that has been endlessly imitated since its initial publication, and is well worth reading.

2. Stephen Leacock - *Sunshine Sketches of a Little Town*: A delightful Canadian novel about a small town around the turn of the 20th century.  There's a lot of kindly humour in this, but it isn't cutesy or false; Leacock is well aware of the baser instincts of his townspeople and describes them (and their consequences) with beautifully subtle sarcasm even as he writes this pleasant love letter to them and their town.  You can find it online easily, as it's now in the public domain; read up to the end of the second chapter (which is just sweet and hilarious and one of the most frequently anthologized pieces of Canadian fiction ever) before deciding on the book as a whole, I implore you.

3. Max Beerbohm - *Zuleika Dobson*: A funny and peculiar novel about what happens when the most beautiful woman in the world comes to stay with her uncle at Oxford.  The consequences are ridiculous and sometimes insane, but always wonderfully described.  Beerbohm was a prose stylist of considerable talent, and I regret that his merits aren't more widely appreciated today.

4. G.K. Chesterton - *The Man Who Was Thursday*: I can't really describe the plot of it for a couple of reasons; first, because it would give too much away, and, second, because the plot is bewildering and weird.  The old Penguin paperback copy I have says of it that it ""begins with an Anarchist plot to destroy the world and turns into a fanciful and hilarious extravaganza,"" or something close to that (I don't want to walk all the way across the room to the shelf, here).  Basically it's about a renegade poet's attempt to secretly infiltrate the grand council of anarchists and the absurd, horrifying, awesome results of this.  There are lots of chases through London and sword fights and hot-air balloons and elephants and nothing is as it seems. 

5. John Steinbeck - *Travels with Charley*: An intriguing travelogue chronicling the trans-American odyssey of the author and his dog in 1960 - they traveled about 10,000 miles in all.  I should note that sometimes it's not very lighthearted or heartwarming at all, but it *is* a thrilling and very often lovely meditation on America and what it means (or meant) to live there.  

Also, don't listen to the person suggesting *Blood Meridian*.  While it *is* very good, it is in no sense what you're looking for here.

And, finally, yes: if you liked *Good Omens*, the *Discworld* books are absolutely worth reading.

"c0lwkfi","Knowing when you can refuse to consent to a search can help, even though ""there ain't no rules on the street.""  In fact, as a practice rule, if an officer ever tries to search anything make sure to affirmatively voice your lack of consent.  Sometimes not saying no is taken by courts to constitute consent.  Again, cops can always lie, but knowing some of this stuff can have some small amount of practical application.  Fuck, at least I hope so.  

Admittedly, I'm a white female from an affluent family so my interactions with police are so far removed from that of the average, say, black man.  Nevertheless, I'm kind of an asshole, and when cops have even shown me a shred of attitude, I get their badge number and complain to their bosses.  I've called the police on the police on numerous occasions and the higher ups think about things such as public relations, and as such show citizens more respect (again, white women here).  If a cop is disrespectful try calling their boss.  I know this sounds insane, but seriously more people need to do this.  There is the temptation to just shrug it off to another experience in a police state, but take the five minutes to report incidents to the ""brass.""

"c0l6tay","First, blahwhatever made the comment I've always dreamed of making (as I am Mr. Rational Deconstructivist), and I love him/her for it.

A completely optimal male is one that is internally focused, one who knows his passions and devotes his life to them, one who is smart/strong/healthy/funny/socially dominant, and one who sets standards for himself and those around him.  Of course, there is no such thing as perfection.

* **Internally focused:**  people who are deeply affected by the actions of others are not internally focused.  It's that simple.  If other people piss you off (or if you rage), you are not internally focused.  If you control your own emotional state at all times (in crowds/by yourself, during successes/during failures, etc), you are internally focused.  If you can laugh at anything, cry at anything, and be calm/cool regardless of your circumstances, you are internally focused.

* **Knowing your passions and devoting your life to them:**  Other people, girls or guys, are not what you should devote your life to.  A lot of men make this mistake and devote all of their available energy (emotional and physical) to their wife/girlfriend.  It's perfectly fine to have a gf who is excellent and who improves your life (and whose life you improve), but you should never devote 100% of your energy to her.  You have passions and dreams (or you should!), and what is most attractive to her and every woman is to see you following them.  Love and children are a tricky part of this - you must absolutely devote as much energy to the love of your life and to your children, but a ""real"" man has enough to spend on them and his passions.  When love breaks, though, the ""perfect"" concept breaks, and if no kids are involved, the ""perfect"" man understands that it's not meant to be and moves on emotionally.  In reality, this is not easy until you've done it many, many times.  Age and experience help.

* **Smart/strong/healthy/funny/socially dominant** are all obvious, though most redditors don't understand the latter so well.  The ability to walk up to a group of absolute strangers and be the cool guy is necessary.  It's not that hard to be him - just be a real man living through your passions and unafraid.  Be able to understand and motivate/stir others passions and motivations.  Be positive and funny and don't defer to other men.  Which leads to the last bullet point...

* **Standards:**  Most male redditors have terrible standards.  These standards include having emotional reactions to any obvious signs of infidelity by anyone, getting angry at people who get the better of you, and thinking that ""bad"" people deserve to have bad things happen to them.  A ""real"" man does not care at all about things that do not affect him or his friends/family/loved ones.  He doesn't react emotionally to infidelity, understanding the potential tenuousness of love.  He doesn't accept people in his life who are negative/energy draining/unwilling to accept him becoming better.  He is non-judgmental.  He is empathic when it benefits his friends/family but also fully willing to let them experience pain.  He does not allow anything in his life that prevents him from reaching his goals.

I left one out, and if people haven't already flipped, this is where they will lose it.  A real man believes whatever is necessary for him to reach his goals.  His beliefs do \*not\* need to reflect reality.  This may sound insane, but most people are unable to recognize that most obstacles in their path are largely ephemeral.  They believe that reality is some imposing and unchangeable external force, and that is simply not true.  I'm a scientist, and I fight with this notion all the time in my own head, but any reading into the breaking of the 4-minute mile and the subsequent rash of sub-4-minute mile runners should be the best example of people confronting ""reality"" head-on and winning.

"c0kb2sv","&gt;He will refer to their views as deranged and insane, but he won't call individuals pathetic or idiotic.

I never do this in the real world unless someone really irritates me. I am a human being that does function in the world, regardless of any incomplete deductions you have made from a few comments on Reddit. On Reddit it really doesn't matter and I am just saying what I think. I honestly do think that religion is pathetic, idiotic, and, to quote Dawkins, a delusion. I think a lot of views held by people are idiotic. So what? There are stupid people in the world.

&gt;Would you treat Elvis believers the same way you treat religious people, calling them idiots and assholes and pathetic people? 

I absolutely would. I would also suggest they seek help. Unfortunately, society accepts that for Elvis conspiracies, but not so much for religious fairy tales. 

&gt;Hitchens would, of course, but don't think for a second that Hitchens is trying to convert religious people. 

As I said in my other response, I'm not really trying to convert people because I believe that conversion is a lost cause in most causes.

To give you more detail, I have a very good friend who's family is absolutely 100% hardcore Pentacostal (as in he speaks in tongue and might even handle snakes, but I never asked). I have known him for years, long before I even considered myself explicitly an atheist (I was nominally Catholic, but never really religious). Other than his religion, he is a great guy. I just know that if I even attempt to convert him, I will lose him as a friend. He respect me enough to accept that I am atheist (although he has told me that he thinks I'm going to hell), but there is absolutely no hope of him giving up his beliefs that have been a core part of his life since the beginning. I do think the fact that he holds these beliefs so dear is pathetic and idiotic, but I do not tell him that to his face because I don't want to hurt him. He and all of his family truly are lost causes on the issue. Luckily, he has managed to moderate over time (he voted for Obama for example, when I think his parents might think that Obama is the anti-Christ), but he certainly isn't going to give up his fundamental beliefs. Where I am from, this is a very typical case. The only hope of this place ever losing religion is for the youth culture to reject it and for old people to die off.

No, he doesn't give undeserved respect to religious belief, but he also goes out of his way to treat individuals with respect. He will refer to their views as deranged and insane, but he won't call individuals pathetic or idiotic. I appreciate you spreading Sam Harris links; many of us who have been fighting this fight for years find Harris to be an inspiring and intelligent individual. But your attitude (below, not above, for confused followers of this exchange) is nothing like that of Sam Harris.

What he does is speak his mind about beliefs. In the very video you link to, you notice he compares belief in religion to belief that Elvis is alive. Would you treat Elvis believers the same way you treat religious people, calling them idiots and assholes and pathetic people? Perhaps you would, but Harris wouldn't and I wouldn't. Sam Harris and I would both look at that belief and say ""That's absurd. Why do you believe that?""

None of Harris, Dennet, or Dawkins would dream of treating people the way you do. Hitchens would, of course, but don't think for a second that Hitchens is trying to convert religious people. He is serving a rather valuable purpose, in giving atheists a focal celebrity who shares their views publicly and isn't ashamed of them-- similar to what Sarah Palin is doing for certain people on the right, only are views aren't batshit crazy.

"c0i6fpq","I actually never used how people liked the movie.  It was well-shot and the tension was often good, but aside from that, the movie was incredibly weak.  

- The characters were all cardboard cutouts - the taciturn looks-pissed-off cowboy who actually is deeply moral and has a heart of gold (every western ever), the ""terminator"" (literally a direct copy), the old wise but disillusioned cop (often played by morgan freeman), etc.

- The weapon was ridiculous.  Why would a serial killer use a weapon that was unreliable (depended on a thin hose), heavy, can only kill within a foot of the person, etc.  It was ridiculous, which is why they couldn't show the final battle because javier bardem would never have gotten close enough to josh brolin in any realistic world.  You could say ""he's insane"" but for some who is insane and illogical he was pretty damn smart about everything else.

- there was the most extensive serial killer and cop-killer in recent history (killed more than the unabomber) but there was literally only one shitty cop chasing him.  IRL there would be 100s of FBI agents within a day.

- Javier Bardem's character was just absurd.  no backstory (how did such a prolific killer not already end up in jail), we were never given a reason he was after the money (was he part of the drug group), and he was practically invincible (survives a car crash, etc.)

"c0hocej","I woke up 10 minutes later then I was 'supposed to' on the first day of highschool. 

My mother then proceeded to scream and hit me for the next 20 minutes while I was getting ready for this big event, calling me names and telling me what a horrible son I am. I was 13 years old, and couldn't handle it, I broke down after about 45 minutes of constant verbal abuse. Then she dropped me off in front of the steps of the highschool, and told me to have a nice first day of school. I think I wept for about a half hour, trying to make sense of what just happened before I stumbled into my first class. Needless to say I didn't make a good impression. 

Naturally, during the day she then collected all of my belongings, wrapped them up in a sheet, and dumped them into the mud next to the driveway at my fathers house, and informed me that I had been kicked out for being a terrible son. 

The next few years were full of events like this, and although I treat her with respect now that I am an adult and say 'I love you too', on the phone, I still hate the selfish, stupid cunt with every fiber of my being. I just don't want to cause family drama, and her life has been tough enough as it is without her son openly despising her.

Just sharing this truly fucked up event still disturbs me. I still don't undestand how could anyone do that to their child. It was so violent, abusive, and insane that it still seems surreal.

My mother experimented on me and my little sister when we were younger, like 10 or so. See, she had all sorts of interesting tools that she uses to map brain waves and record biofeedback data. She used to hook us up to her devices, and run us through various tests. Nothing that hurt, just...weird shit. Electrodes on the head and chest, all sorts of monitors and shit hooked up to our fingers and toes. She would have us color in pictures or move objects on computer screens by changing our brain wave patterns. It was fun, and interesting to us, and at the time seemed pretty benign.

But years later I realized something.

"c0h6pj5","Truly insightful.

The common individual is not broken or insane, but confused.

As groups we assimilate and act in ways that we never dream of individually. 
It's this lack of congruence that has created the society that we live in. 

A lack of self belief instils a level of reliance and codependance, which in turn reinforces not only our own lack of self worth but that of our leaders.  Our Outlook has turned inward if you will. 

Why would a leader cease to act in a way that hurts others, when the people that he hurts tell him to keep doing it?

On a moral level he/she may know if to be wrong, but we are creatures of habit and not of morals.

If he/she truly understood that he/she was creating pain for others,  then his behaviour would change in an instant. If you think this is incorrect,  ask yourself why. 

The governed are collectively caught in a circle of incongruence. The cycle will continue for as long as a critical mass of individuals(as is the present case) expresses another persons ideas before their own. 

Believing that we are special is a meme, a behavioural program executed within us. It's code so well developed that people seldom ever see its limitations.  The worlds problems are not due to our leaders, or the people. To say this is to merely perpetuate that we are victims and continue the ideas propagation.

Civilized society requires that a new meme takes hold, and this will occur as a natural process. Survival depends on progression. 

A change in environment creates a change in behaviour,  and our current society is saturated to the point that business as usual requires increasing levels of thought effort.  Therefore, our brains will follow the path of least resistance and a new behavioural pattern will reach critical mass. 

Whether that means a path of anarchy or leadership in a new way, I can't say.",1260811867,"the common individual is not broken or insane, but confused.","insane, but confused","insane","but",TRUE,"insane , but confused","confused",NA,NA,1

My wife owns the complete run of the series on DVD, and I went ahead and ripped the whole series and put it on the Apple TV (it just barely fits on the 40GB drive, too), and she's gone ahead, now, and watched it all the way through at least five or six times. She loves the show. I'm not as fond of it, but since the TV and the Apple TV are in the bedroom, I'm often laying there trying to sleep while she's enjoying another run through its 94 episodes.

I find one of the most frightening aspects of Nazi ideology to be its own breed of inexorable logic.  Under capitalism in crisis, only an authoritarian government can stop the rise of Bolshevism.  Authoritarian governments cannot survive under pluralism, hence the other must be suppressed.  A booming economy must expand to survive.  War with neighbours is inevitable, so the advantage of the first strike must be seized.  To unite the nation, scapegoats can be useful.  Oppressed minorities will work against you, so it pays to incarcerate them.  Food during wartime is scarce, so it's better to feed your army than your prisoners.  Shooting prisoners is wasteful, it's far more efficient to gas them.

It started out when we would go out to eat and he would say he didn't have any money. Of course someone offered to cover him. Weeks later they would ask if he could pay them back. He would say he thought they had covered him. Apparently when someone pays for him, he doesn't expect to return the favor.

He then lived with another friend of mine in college. We told the dude it would end badly, but he was way too nice and didn't see that the kid was manipulative. He ended up using all sorts of my friend's supplies, running my friend's printer out of ink, taking money from my friend's change jar when he felt like it, using my friend's computer when he felt like it, etc. Then one year he just didn't come back to school.

"c097ils","I don't think I'll be asking him to stop drinking anytime soon.  He has a very careful schedule he keeps to and as I mentioned elsewhere on here back in the 70's he was pronounced incurable.  So I'm kind of afraid to suggest any changes.  He's had schizophrenia for over 40 years now (he's nearly 60).

He has mentioned he still hears a lot of things (I'm not sure about seeing things, he likes to make jokes about seeing things but we can never tell how serious he is).  I'd imagine what you're saying about the radio is true for him.  It seems like the evenings are his coping time and he gets irritable if it's too changed.  It took us a while to realize it, but the few times he offered to stay up late to do something with us actually meant a lot more to him than we realized.  Mostly because he was changing his schedule, I think.  He talk to the devil on the phone a lot, that's the only character he's told us about.  He realizes it's fake, but seems to have fun bantering with him.

In general I'm really impressed with him.  I mean, he says a lot of things that could be hurtful if you didn't realize he just has a weird sense of humor.  But what impresses me is he actually raised a daughter alone.  His ex-wife went crazy and now lives with her father, she had no actual mental disorder.  In fact, he told her about some of his hallucinations and she believes they are true (talking to the devil) and even tried to get Rachel put into foster care because her father was ""talking to the devil.""  I guess she's given me a big appreciation for him.  She isn't crazy and completely and utterly failed as a parent...he technically is crazy, but (and though he wasn't a great parent, often distant and paranoid she was lying to him) he actually provided a stable house for my wife to grow up in and is fairly well to do in general (actually better than my parents, again not insane but bankrupt and abusive).

I guess that's what gives me my amazement at the human mind, that he can talk to the devil his entire life (among other hallucination) but still lead a fairly normal and constructive life.  It sounds like you're doing the same.  Imagine that you're able to have so many characters stored in your head so realistically and on top of all that you're able to function (I'm assuming) well as a normal human being.  It's not like part of you was taken away by the characters, they were added on top of the normal functions.

If you don't mind me asking, and this is just out of interest, could you describe some of the characters you have?  What's the point of the medication, does it reduce the hallucination or does it mostly help you realize they're fake?  What medication are you on now?  Is it hard to find personal alone time?

I think she's make a great companion! Don't let the picture put you off though. It's a promotional photo from skins take about three years ago. In skins she plays an anorexic, and slightly insane but brilliant and emotionally deep girl, so she looks loopy in the photo because of her role. And she is now older than when she took this picture. 

Skins was a great series, and I believe she'll bring a lot to the show. The choice makes sense if they want younger viewers as well, since she's almost ubiquitously popular among the British youth because of the extremely successful Skins series. I know many hate it when shows say they want to bring in younger viewers, they feel slighted as fans and think their show is going to the dogs. But this never comes to pass, and to be honest Doctor Who will need to bring in the younger generation in order to survive into the future. If they don't bring them in then it will die as the previous generation moves on. And don't you remember the love you had for the show as a kid?

"c087eu5","Edit: Right, so someone disagrees with you and you vote them down. Can't have meaningful discussion now can we, might prove some of your 'theories' wrong. 

Ok I've been reading reddit for some time and the comments in this thread has finally broken the camels back. I registered just to post this.

First, Darwin was Racist, Sexist, and Mentally unstable. He considered woman, and all other races inferior. This is likely the reason he set out to come up with a theory to PROVE his race, in his mind, was superior. 

Source: http://conservapedia.com/Charles_Darwin

Secondly, Evolution is not a 'fact', it is a theory. Even your own scientists claim so. Most of the mechanisms Darwin used to describe evolution have turned out to be proven wrong. 

Source: http://conservapedia.com/Evolution

I can accept Microevolution- this makes sense. This is the mechanism for which eye colors are determined etc. But DNA does not lend any mechanism for major changes- how can one creature have a child that has a major feature it didn't have?

i.e. How could a rat like animal give birth to something with two legs and two arms instead of four legs? You could say it ""took a long time"" but at some point you had a parent with four legs that had a child with two.

If such a thing could possibly happen, we would see children being born with random things like this happening all the time. Instead, we just see things like different eye color (That already exists in the dna, mind you. You don't suddenly see a child born with orange eyes). 

Also, if a rat was our earliest mammal ancestor, where did it come from? did a reptilian lizard just one day give birth to a fluffy rat? that seems pretty unlikely. Even if you claim it took like 100 generations it still wouldn't happen. 

I'm not saying that the earth is only 6000 years old- new earth creationists are batshit insane, but modern evolution theory is pretty far fetched.

Is it so hard to beleve that a higher intelligence created life? The dinosaurs were an interesting experiment but of course he wanted to create something better, in his image, so he killed them off with a meteor and started again.

My daughter used to go to a public school. The science teacher there taught her about evolution and said God didn't exist.

"c05rot5","Here's some input from an Iranian dude from my university (he is dyslexic and a bit insane but very very bright and worth a read):

&gt;I am Iranian, and I can tell you Cole is wrong.

&gt;Let's start with simple fact, that is not directly relevant. He writes that Khomaini said the Shah government ""must go"". But ""az bain bayad berad"" does not mean ""go"", it litterarly mean something like ""must cease to exist"", and the most direct translation would be ""must be destroyed"".

&gt;Now to the latter part:

&gt;""bayad az safheh-ye ruzgar mahv shavad""

&gt;The translation is not perfect, the dear Professor is not convewing the action implyied the sentence, as I or any Iranian would read it.
I am not a translatior, but I can tell you that here is a clear note in that sentence that Israel must be made to wanish from the face of time.
Maybe this is not a theat, as it was not directed to Israel, but to his followers, but it clearly is an decleration of intent. The intent is to make Israel cease to exist.

&gt;The word map is not litterarly in there, but ""wiped of the map"" is a less exagerated translation that Professors Coles translation is underreporting the wording.

&gt;Now to the context. Here Cole is not a little of the mark, he is insane and ignorant.

&gt;Exactly as Hithens wrote the qute is not that ""the occupation of Jerusalem must end, just as the occupation of Gaza ended"", implying that Iran want Israel to give Jerusalem to Palestine. The qute is that the ""regime that is occupying Jerualem"" must be destroyed.

&gt;Iranians clerics often use this way of talking, they always don't say ""Israel"", ""US"" or ""the war"", they make some negative phrase and use it as a synonym. Khomeini could have an entire speech and never say amrika, just ""the great satan"" etc. They would almost always take the effort to say ""the war that was emposed on us"" instead of the war.

&gt;Any student like me student with no academic credentials could tell you ""een rezhim-e ishghalgar-e qods"" would best be translated as ""Israel"".

&gt;As hichens wrote (presumably with the help of some iranian), the sentence is not about the occupation, it is about the state. Cole is completely missrepresenting this (which seems to be his main point) in the letter. Either he is intentionally lying for a good cause (stop a war), or he is just blind because of ideology.

&gt;The Ivy league professor, earning his 200 k or whatever it is, writes ""He said that the occupation regime over Jerusalem must be erased from the page of time.""

&gt;WRONG. The currect translation would be ""the regime that is [defined by] occupying the holy city of Jerusalem"" must be ""erased from the page of time"", or must be ""destroyed, or must ""be wiped off the map"" (I agree that eased from the page of time is closer than whped of the map, but neither is perfect, and the underlying meaning is not in dispute, The State of Israel be destroyed).

&gt;Factually the ""western journalist"" Hichens is right and the western academic wrong. It is NOT just a question of context, it is a question of substituting the Presidents refrens to an entity (Israel, the state the occupyies Jerusalem) to a refrens to what Israel is doing (occupying Jerusalem, as they occupyed Gaza).

&gt;Cole writes that the Iranians have not called for a nazi-style exterimation. I would say this is true, they have not done so. Destrying Israel could be done by invading it and forcing the population to move to say Madagascar or Manhattan, it does not by itself imply extermination.

&gt;On the other hand I don't know if people have reported the qute this way, they say Ahmadnejanian wants Israel off the map (a non perfect but acceptable translation, substituting one figurative phrase with another) and leaves the level of violance open. This is by the way exactly what Ahmadnejanian said after the press asked him, he said we don't want to kill the jews, we want Israel gone, Europe can take them.

&gt;Lasty I really have to questions Coles knowledge about Iran in two points, one in the letter and one in the angry answer to Hitchens.

&gt;1. That the phrase is ""A decades old quote Khomaini"" is hardly something that would reduce the seriousness of using it. Khomeini is to the hardliners what Washington, Lincolns and all the founding fathers are to Americans combined, and than some. His quotes are as close as you can come to a ideological program for the Islamic State as anyting.

&gt;I can't come up with a good example, from the lack of knowledge of quotes, but if Americans declared to Japan in WWII ""give me liberty of give me death"", the Japanese wouls hardly say ""don't take them seriusly, they are just quoting Patrick Henry"".

&gt;2. That Ahmadinejad is not the complete ruler hardly means he has no power. If you say that you are completely ignorant of Iranian politics, which is very complex, and where there are multiple competing layers of power. Basically the President through his institutional role has control over a large part of the massive civilian Iranian state, and in this case through being a hardliner additional power, for example over the Bonyads, the ""builders"", the Guard.

&gt;It is also context specific, just like America. Bush had more power in march 2003, not only because he is president, but because he used this role and though a political agenda and alliances moved the project of invading Iraq. In May 2006 Bush has more Republicans in Congress and is still the President, but has much less power.

&gt;Conlcluding that Khatami became powerless after the hardliners broke him (or after he willingly gave up, that is a question of dispute) and therefore Ahmadinejad is powerless is idiotic.

&gt;PS.

&gt;I hope this conflict can be resolved without violance, for example though sanctions specifically on the regime. If America feels that it must use violance I hope it is only arial bombardment against millitary targets and against the regime.
