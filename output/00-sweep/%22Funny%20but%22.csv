"fx307ik","Shallan is my favourite character alongside Dalinar, and (possibly in the future) Lift. She was entertaining to read in TWoK, brilliant in WoR, and relatable but sometimes too melodramatic in OB. She has really interesting personal dilemmas and struggles with her past, and the way she deals with them is really engaging. The way she uses her wit and an acid but sometimes childish humor to deal with serious situations and trauma make her really well-fleshed and charming in her own way. The moments in which she shines the most, in my opinion, are those where she interacts with Hoid and, seeing him as some kind of foreign and wise entity, she lets her insecurities flow, showing a human side of her that makes me feel connected to her problems in a way almost no other character in any media has ever accomplished. And all of that without pointing out how brilliantly executed her PTSD-related behaviour is.

I do admit she may not be a character written for everyone. She uses humor to deflect unpleasant thoughts and feelings, and humor is subjective and personal. She also shows struggles a young adult would normally show, and some people might feel that out of place in an almost apocaliptic world, considering her personal feelings out of place. Also, I don't think Veil's dynamic with Kaladin and the whole love triangle thing helped in any way.

I like to make a parallel between her and Lift. Lift is *awesome* (pun intended), but displays the typical behaviour of an entitled brat, which is exactly what Brandon seems to try and portrait for her at this time of the series. I find her funny, but at the same time really interesting and mysterious (oh boy was that extract of a chapter of hers in RoW sublime). However, I can see how some people can consider her annoying, and understand their viewpoint.

For me, I know Kaladin is a well-executed and fleshed character, but he just isn't for me. His portrait of depressions is amazing, but his melodramatic side doesn't connect with me in any way. At least, his interactions with Syl are pure gold. And even then, I understand why so many people feel enthralled with his character arc.

In a complex world like Stormlight, where so many characters are important, it's impossible to feel connected to all of them. But I think Brandon has made and amazing job giving each of them traits that make some people feel awestruck with Shallan and Jasnah's interactions, while other are just giggling with Adolin and Kaladin's dynamic or laughing out loud each time Lift encounters Dalinar.

TLDR Shallan is awesome, funny and interesting to read for me, but I understand why some people might disagree the same way I disagree with popular opinions of some characters.",1594026480,"tldr shallan is awesome, funny and interesting to read for me, but i understand why some people might disagree the same way i disagree with popular opinions of some characters.","funny and interesting","funny",NA,FALSE,"funny and interesting","interesting",NA,NA,1

Elena - I actually agree with your points about her lol but for me she gets a 6/10

Damon - I absolutely agree with you about Damon!! I didn't care for him much either. He was a bad person and only became better bc of Elena and not for himself which i didn't really like either. I mean he was funny but other wise that's it so yeah definitely 4/10 for me too

Stefan- you are on point about Stefan too!!! And I give him an 9/10 only bc I was so tired of him never getting a handle on the ripper thing  

Caroline- personally I didn't mind Caroline after season one but that being said the main thing that bothered me about her was how she always shared her opinions in offensive ways... so she's an 8/10 for me

Bonnie - Bonnie is the hero of the show. She and Stefan carried TVD she sacrificed so much to help the people she loved. And she lost so much but was never able to grieve. She had so many hardships and didn't let them stop her!!!! 10/10 for BONNIE

Matt - I don't hate him but he was pretty annoying after a while so 3/10

Alaric - Best teacher dad ever!!! He was an amazing father figure for elena and Jeremy.  And he was a great friend for Damon!! 8/10 

Jeremy- this may be an unpopular opinion but I actually love Jeremy. When I first kinda got familiar with him I was rooting for him!! He went through everything loss that Elena went through but he didn't have the same emotional support she had and yet he still tried to fight for the people he had left! He was sweet caring protective and he had his funny moments too. I just wish the writers did more with him so Jer gets a 8.5/10

Tyler - he went from a typical bully to an alpha male and I loved it!!! Tyler was such had great character development. And I hate how it was just thrown away and he became a jerk just to get back at klaus.. smh. I really liked Tyler and his relationships with Caroline his friendship with Matt and they way him and Jeremy's relationship grew from hatred to friendship it was great!!!

"foijx6f","""Cringey"" and ""Hilarious"" are not necessarily mutually exclusive. The humour in the UK Office series was much more focused on humour that was both funny but simultaneously cringeworthy.

In the case of Scott's Tots, the setup is funny and the premise is kind of absurd but simultaneously believable in the context of Michael's character. So it's real enough to feel empathy for him. And that's the problem (for me anyway).

You ever watch TV coverage of some sporting event where someone gets injured in a really unpleasant way? Maybe a player's leg bends back the wrong way after falling or their shin bone ends up coming through the front of their leg? A lot of people will look away form that kind of thing because it triggers some pretty unpleasant emotional/mental responses. Maybe it's just empathy - you can sort of imagine what that pain would be like after all. Or maybe it's part of your brain being too stupid to know that it's not your leg that's damaged (quite common for people to grab their own leg if they see a leg injury). 

Something like Scott's Tots is like watching a slow-motion replay of someone about to be injured in a pretty horrible way. The injury is psycho-social instead of physical but we've all been embarrassed and it's so easy to imagine what it would be like.  Even if you've not seen the episode, they explain it (with Stanley's newspaper) very early on so you can definitely see it coming. The individual elements are obviously designed to intensify the embarrassment and so it becomes gradually harder to watch as you go on this journey with Michael.",1587788514,"the humour in the uk office series was much more focused on humour that was both funny but simultaneously cringeworthy.","funny but simultaneously","funny","but",FALSE,"funny but simultaneously cringeworthy","cringeworthy",NA,"simultaneously",1

I’ve been on that spectrum when I am so lonely, I wondered if maybe I would have better luck in another gender pool. Sometimes loneliness really makes you explore different possibilities.

That dude and I are a little bi to begin with, and we both had been lonely people. I would actually suggest you to explore with dudes, if you wanna take a walk down that path. I mean why not? Life is short. Try everything, you can feel nothing or feel something afterwards. 

I have lived that way for a few years, so eventually you would reach two conclusions:
1) If you are lonely and couldn’t find anyone, you actual have to work on yourself, eat healthy, groom yourself, educate yourself, learn to enunciate your feelings (I learnt to write) and deal with your own issues... You need to be prepared internally and externally to have meaningful relationships with other people. It’s like sculpting a piece of wood before you sell it to the market. 
2) That if you’re into dudes, you’re into dudes. If you’re into girls, you’re into girls. If you’re into a bit of both then you’re into a bit of both. My friend sleeps with both, but know he can’t date a dude. I flirt with and kiss both, but know I would be way happier with guys than girls. But let’s see what life throws at you.

Anyways. I saw you in the r/Askreddit meme, and then somehow I’m here. I know you are lonely, and shit would get better. Work on yourself, I was bullied in school for being ugly, then bullied again because having no friends left me with very little social skills. Now I’m described as fairly attractive, very stylish, quite sociable and funny, but a difficult childhood and the dark suicidal thoughts that’s been there since kindergarten makes me easy to know but hard to understand, and therefore I’m still single and have almost never dated. But that’s okay, I would wait for someone who is suiting: Been through difficult times, but worked through them, and therefore have that depth of understanding.

Again, I can tell you are lonely by the reddit post you are posting. Being alone sucks, I liked it that no one expected anything from me, but we are social animals and it sucks. I am sorry male receives so little emotional support, I will study Gender Studies and try to bring out male issues in the gender equality discussions. This message is way longer than I planned it to, but I just hope you eventually live a better life, okay? Take care of yourself dude",1584429318,"now i’m described as fairly attractive, very stylish, quite sociable and funny, but a difficult childhood and the dark suicidal thoughts that’s been there since kindergarten makes me easy to know but hard to understand, and therefore i’m still single and have almost never dated.","sociable and funny","funny",NA,FALSE,"quite sociable and funny","sociable",NA,"quite",0

"fjmfsdu","I forgot to mention that some of that isn't telepathy but more street smarts. If you're around people who basically are two faced, you have to learn what sets them off. 

I've unfortunately had way too many people try to get close who had some kindof objective related to gangstalking. It is a real thing and it's more predictive.. they stalk you and figure you out so you just have to practice not feeding into it.

My best tactic is having a routine and it has to be something somewhat satisfactory to them and sad because that's kinda their sick mission. The reason why I like doing this is because I can get things done without sabotage and interference. If I have a routine, they can't predict when I actually have something outside of that routine going on and I can conceal my plans easier without less disruption. Essentially, they think every thurs in the afternoon, I do this but I make plans in advance through a channel they don't have access to so when thurs rolls around.. they don't see it coming, don't have enough time to plot and can't interfere. 

Anytime I talk about plans and really big ones I'm excited for, they are almost always sabotaged but if I use devices that are outside of their range and communicate to those I trust and through channels they don't have access to online then it's easier and idk why this works but it does. There's a sociologist who has a lot of tips and tricks to dealing with it. 

So this is gonna sound funny but most people can read eachother and pick up on your expressions and body language. Once you understand the science behind that and alter your vibes, expressions etc using it then these assholes basically can't get to you. That's the gist what I'm saying.

So I'll use something from my own life as an example. So I've had people think that I had a crush on someone.. this has been pattern with some fake friends. Let's say we're all at a party and they go up to that person, they gossip to him about me and then one of these fake friends dates him and watches for my reaction. I fake being sad whatever lol. (Yeah they actually have a relationship with him for my sake lol so it goes on for a few weeks). So while they are at the party talking to my crush.. what they don't realize is I lied to them. My crush is on the opposite end of the room and not the person I told them. This has been a regular tactic that I use. Yeah it's disturbing and yeah it happened long after high school. 

I've had some who knew I was going to a big event right? So I lied about the date and location to everyone and then last min I corrected it. The change was too last min for them to disrupt. In the past, they would show up and make a scene or create some other disturbance on the day I needed to be there. 

Why do these assholes exist and have such extreme motives? I don't really care.. I just think they view some people as objects like in a  video game and they have stats. They wanna hurt people and brag about it. They brag about how clever their plots are and they just like are more fucked up trolls.. this person is a loser, is fat, is phony, is crazy, is a slut, is a bitch, etc., they believe sometimes that even what they're doing is heroic and like I'm the bad guy. Even if I made mistakes or someone hurt me.. I wouldn't be doin what they do unless it was something really horrible. And even then, this is too twisted and passive aggressive. If I really wanted to.. I wouldn't take them down privately, I would go for the same things they're doing which is their livelihood and thats kindof what gangstalking does sadly. 

In short, with telepathy.. you do have to hide your emotions and thoughts bc some may not be able to read but they have been stalking you long enough to know your tells and behaviors enough to know some of what you think and some will try to send messages. I am a firm believer in the tactic that some therapists use for night terrors and you fight them verbally or physically if they try to send messages using lucid dreaming techniques. It's always worked for me and i laugh at them, I realize that they might hate on me but they are spending an incredible amount of their time and resources on me and it's sad in and of itself. 


TL:DR
This is more to do honestly with social ostracizing and bullying bs. That's what I mean by tricking, they think they have predicted my behavior and are onto me but I have been paying attention and since I know what their desired result is? I just make my own plans to mess up their result. It is very stressful and I've grown up in a small town my whole life with the same hateful people and I hope one day, I can change my environment and leave this behind. Idk if any of this made sense, I'm a lil sleepy but yeah that's the best I got.",1583469403,"so this is gonna sound funny but most people can read eachother and pick up on your expressions and body language.","funny but most","funny","but",FALSE,"funny but most","most",NA,NA,1

I ns and a meal are two different things.

In my opinion, this is a funny but poor comparison.

A relationship is far more complicated.

Joking about stuff like that is not only not funny, but also stupid and dangerous. Especially when considering the audience PDP has. Making casually racist jokes or comments can have a negative impact on people. Casual racism can fuel prejudice and discrimination.
People will start to think stuff like that is OK. Will start doing those ""jokes"" themselves in real life. In the end impacting the people's lives that are on the other side of these ""jokes"" or clichés etc

First of all: it is not just a word.
And why even use that word? So many words out there, but that is his go to word?
And of course he apologized. Because he had to. And then it was one of those many ""sorry I got caught and offended someone"" kind of apologies.
It tells you something when this is a person's go-to word that he probably used countless times before already.

There was more than that ""accidentally shout out"".

In case you're interested, I'll let you know that this all started with the Assyrian genocide.  The clergy of the Syriac Orthodox Church started persecuting Syriac Orthodox Assyrian nationalists, who translated the name of our church to Assyrian in English at the time, during and after the genocide. There is good evidence that this was done because they didn't want us to be associated with ""Nestorians"", the Assyrians belonging to the Church of the East, since they were known to fight back, which led to the Simele massacre of 1933 in Iraq, after which the clergy of the SOC became hardcore anti-Assyrian to the point where they would disrespect anything to do with the Church of the East.

I have a few diagnosed mental illnesses that culminated in a few hospitalizations and suicide attempts which particularly affected our dad.

Books: 

Ayn Rand books - long. Very long. Maybe even, very wrong. Fun though, even if I am alone in thinking that.

Hemingway - wonderful writer, but less meaningful because of who I am. Something to aspire to. Love, feel pain, know life.

Kafka - Wonderful and funny, but something to fear. I found a good pairing with Hemingway. 

Pratchett - Watch a man channel his anger into comedy, mocking the world. Read his early work.

LeGuin - I havnt read much, just a short story. If I had money I would read more. 

Orwell - A fav. Down and out in london and paris opens with the tale of a cherub looking man telling orwell of a young girl he raped and how it was the purest of love. 

Lovecraft - See the unknown without.

Juji Ito - See the unknown within.

Haruki Murakami - A weird dream

Rihanna just hit me on a text
Last night I left hickeys on her neck
Wait, you just dissed me? I'm perplexed
Insult me in a line, compliment me on the next
Damn, I'm really sorry you want me to have a heart attack
Was watchin' 8 Mile on my NordicTrack
Realized I forgot to call you back
Here's that autograph for your daughter, I wrote it on a Starter cap
Stan, Stan, son
Listen, man, Dad isn't mad
But how you gonna name yourself after a damn gun
And have a man-bun?
The giant's woke, eyes open, undeniable
Supplyin' smoke, got the fire stoked
Say you got me in a scope, but you grazed me
I say one call to Interscope and you're Swayze
Your reply got the crowd yelling, ""Woo!""
So before you die let's see who can out-petty who
With your corny lines (""Slim, you're old"")—ow, Kelly, ooh
But I'm 45 and I'm still outselling you
By 29, I had three albums that had blew
Now let's talk about somethin' I don't really do
Go in someone's daughter's mouth stealin' food
But you're a fuckin' mole hill
Now I'ma make a mountain out of you, woo!
Ho, chill, actin' like you put the chrome barrel to my bone marrow

Go back to Recovery,"" oh shoot, that was three albums ago

In a state of bliss 'cause I said his goddamn name
Now I gotta cock back, aim
Yeah, bitch, pop Champagne to this! (Pop)
It's your moment
This is it, as big as you're gonna get, so enjoy it
Had to give you a career to destroy it
Lethal injection
Go to sleep six feet deep, I'll give you a B for the effort
But if I was three-foot-eleven
You'd look up to me, and for the record
You would suck a dick to fuckin' be me for a second
Lick a ballsack to get on my channel
Give your life to be as solidified
This mothafuckin' shit is like Rambo when he's out of bullets
So what good is a fuckin' machine gun when it's outta ammo?
Had enough of this tatted-up mumble rapper
How the fuck can him and I battle?
He'll have to fuck Kim in my flannel
I'll give him my sandals
'Cause he knows, long as I'm Shady he's gon' have to live in my shadow
Exhausting, letting off on my offspring
Lick a gun barrel, bitch, get off me!
You dance around it like a sombrero, we can all see
You're fuckin' salty
'Cause Young Gerald's balls-deep inside of Halsey
Your red sweater, your black leather
You dress better, I rap better
That a death threat or a love letter?
Little white toothpick
Thinks it's over a pic, I just don't like you, prick
Thanks for dissing me
Now I had an excuse on the mic to write ""Not Alike""

I'm sick of your mumble rap mouth
Need to get the cock up out it
Before we can even talk about it (Talk about it)
I'm sick of your blonde hair and earrings
Just 'cause you look in the mirror and think
That you're Marshall Mathers (Marshall Mathers)

"evskn6s","Don't wanna beat around the bush, your pics are an absolute no-go. Tinder is hard for every single one of us (except if you're Chris Hemsworth), but there's definitely a few things you can do to make it less harder. 

I get it, you want to appear casual and funny, but apart from pic 4 (hangs out with friends&gt;has a social life&gt;good) and maybe pic 9 (guitars always kinda work) your pics are plain awful. Don't get me wrong, that doesn't mean that you're ugly. But do you really think, ANY girl will swipe right on a guy who wears funny vampire teeth or holds a camera in front of his face? 

Keep in mind that every woman hotter than an amoeba has a shitload of options to match with. Every single day. Tinder is a shark tank and presenting yourself in the best possible way is absolutely crucial. Or you will end up as fish food. Sorry for being brutally honest, but pity won't get you any further.

1) Take some decent, favorable pictures of yourself. Try different postures, focus on good lighting and keep it simple. Not too much casual and funny shit. You definitely need at least one good headshot and a full body picture. Ask a friend for help if you want to.

2) Stick to your 3 or 4 best pictures. Never use more than 6 pictures. Noone wants to swipe through a whole photo album (again, except if you're Chris Hemsworth).

3) Use your bio. If you want to appear funny, here's your chance. A combination of favorable pics and a funny bio works best in my opinion.

"ethulvt","His Novels: The reason people are still going to be reading Wallace in 150 years. Again, you've got 3 to choose from, the freshman effort [Broom of the System](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6750.The_Broom_of_the_System), the magnum opus [Infinite Jest](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6759.Infinite_Jest), and the posthumously published [The Pale King](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9443405-the-pale-king). I think Wallace's strengths as a writer, the long, coursing passages and psychologically damaged characters talking past one another, are best captured in this form. Harold Bloom characterizes his style as ""maximalist,"" as opposed to ""minimalist,"" and while I'm not sure I agree completely with that characterization it does a good job of capturing what it feels like to read pages of Wallace. All the information you thought you could need and then some. But it's worth it! All the information you are being inundated with comes with a payoff. The only thing is that payoff is usually 250 pages down the road or hidden in a footnote. That makes his novels feel very dense, but also gives them a feeling of claustrophobia and inter-connectedness reminiscent of Pynchon but not nearly so paranoiac. What this style allows him to do is present the total deluge of information and competing realities (the corporate reality, the objective reality, the televised reality, the microcosmic reality of the nuclear family,) in a way where they can all coexist and confuse and compete with one another, in a way that I feel is very reminiscent of contemporary American life. I'm sure of life in any modernized country, but it is presented in a particularly American way. People can agree or disagree with that, but it's for that kind of artistic portrayal that I keep coming back to his works.

Broom of the System, if we want to continue the Pynchon comparison, is to Infinite Jest as V is to Gravity's Rainbow. But not quite as good as V. Probably my least favorite Wallace book. It comes off as a book written by a really smart college kid trying to show you how smart he is. Which it is.

Infinite Jest. This is the big one. Certainly his best work. After Broom of the System in '87 and Girl with Curious Hair in '89 he doesn't publish another fiction book until 1996. Before it comes out it's hyped to high heaven by his publisher, and oddly enough, lives up to it. The New Sincerity wiki article I linked at the top really starts to come through here, where the tenets of AA are considered as actual philosophical imperatives. Cliches are cliches because they work. Wallace's first two works are ironic and funny, but Infinite Jest has soul. And the name of that soul is Don Gately. Unarguably the best character he ever created, and completely original. The (literally) block-headed employee at the halfway house, a recovered thief and opiate addict, his story of redemption (confused as it is by the structure of the novel itself,) is a strong dramatic arc that serves as the engine of this gigantic book. I am not going to attempt a plot summary here, suffice to say it involves an advanced tennis academy, a halfway house, one fucked up family (the Incandenzas,) and a plot by wheelchair-bound assassins to destroy the world using the ""Entertainment,"" an irresistible movie created by the father of the aforementioned family, which forces the viewer to continue watching until they die. But don't get lost in the plot. Wallace is an incredible writer, and just reading sentence-by-sentence is a pleasure. If you know a lot of the Western Canon the book is more enjoyable, but you certainly don't have to know about Brother's Karamazov or Hamlet. Although if you do read one thing before, I would suggest Hamlet. That story is mirrored in the book in maaaaany ways, I mean, the title comes from the graveyard scene where Hamlet is holding up Yorrick's skull, ""Alas, poor Yorick! I knew him, Horatio, a fellow of infinite jest, of most excellent fancy."" And an interesting fact, the PGOAT (Prettiest Girl Of All Time) in the book, Madame Psychosis, and her relationship with Orin is based on Wallace's actual relationship with (and unhealthy obsession of,) the writer Mary Karr. Some readers have faulted the ending of the book, for not tying it up, but without spoiling it, it's actually structurally apropos, and I found it very satisfying. However, the book is not without it's shortcomings. It actually is too long, I think he could have safely lost about 100-150 pages of the Quebecois politics stuff and the book would have been better for it. That said, Infinite Jest is a masterpiece that will stand the test of time. The hype is real.

The Pale King, unfortunately not completed before his suicide, he left the manuscript along with instructions for editing in his office when he hung himself, so he certainly intended that it would be published in some form. Unfortunately not as good as Infinite Jest, and there are some jarring repetitions of phrase and scenes he almost certainly would have cut had he been around to write the thing himself. This book does get the closest to an average American experience. He was a lifelong student/scholar/outsider, and this book marked his first attempt to tackle contemporary American working life. He set the thing in an IRS center in the Midwest, and the book is, mainly, an examination of boredom. Consequently, it is, at times, boring. All in all though, if you take it for what it is, it's another solid novel. Not as structurally interesting as Infinite Jest, but that's what you get when you have an editor organizing it and not the writer. Certainly better than his first novel, but a pale shadow of his second.

-I wish they had revealed it at THIS e3 instead of the last, and made a beta for dedicated players to test until release. 

-like many said there's not a lot of reason for multiplayer as it doesn't add a whole lot to the game. A couple things are easier with a group, like events, but still doable solo. 

- I'd be okay with a shortage of NPCs if they're leading up to you actually finding a settlement or just something.

-still see a lot of bugs while I play, whether it be graphical or just straight up ""wtf"" moments.

-the AI seems kinda dumb. In one event at the airport the mobs spawned at the top of a cliff and just sorta..jumped off and died trying to get to us.  I found it really funny but also annoying, an entire wave of enemies spawn in the same spot for you to mow down, but subsequently fall to they're doom and neglecting to give me exp or loot for it.

-even with all the randoms running around the game feels empty and lonely.

"eqbdcy1","I think my problem was he was too similar in certain ways, like they lifted lines straight from the '92 Aladdin for Smith to use. Smith made it his own as much as he could, but there was always this feeling that he was just a lesser version of Robin's Genie (and this is really apparent during the songs, exact same lyrics and melody, but a much weaker delivery from Smith... doesn't help that Smith doesn't have the strongest singing voice, so a little auto-tune can be heard from time to time).

And the thing is, I've seen the stage version of Aladdin on the West End and the guys they got to play the Genie there and on Broadway were really able to make the character their own.

"eoeuu05","No, legion of skanks is satire. Nobody believes that hate speech the bear represents the beliefs of the hosts. It’s satire because it’s making fun of racism. Satire is taking a shitty idea and pushing it as far as it will go to make fun of how fucking dumb the actual idea is. 

Jonathan Swift’s “A Modest Proposal” was satire because it was like, “ alright you English bitches hate the Irish so much? Why don’t we just kill and eat all their babies? That’s what you want to do right?”

It was funny but also impactful because it took racism against the Irish and pushed it to its logical conclusion. You hate the Irish? Well then let’s kill them and eat their kids. It forces people to address their prejudice and realize that by thinking the way they do, the only logical conclusion is to fuckin kill people. 

That’s what LOS and pods like cumtown do. They say absurdly racist shit for laughs, because it’s so fucking crazy to think that way, so it’s funny. That’s why it’s funny, because no one actually thinks that, but the racist humor is funny because it’s so shocking and absurd.

"en347op","You're right, her dialogue isn't any more arrogant, it's all about delivery. 

Take Thor's line in Infinity War: ""Well he's never fought me twice."" Thor is an arrogant character, and up until Infinity War, he hadn't really lost to that extent. Now he's crushed - he's lost everything, including his family and friends. Even then, he's still at least somewhat confident in his ability to beat Thanos in the end, because that's what he knows. He delivers the line, with a smile, and it's funny. Yes, he's still destroyed, but humor and a bit of arrogance is how he's dealing with the stress.

Tony's description of himself in the first Avengers: ""Genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist."" With the look in his eye, and the nod Natasha gives, the line is funny, but also arrogant. It's the humor and charisma with which the line is given that covers the arrogance, and still makes the line great. 

Yes, many characters are arrogant. But for one, they are faced with realities that force them to (at least a bit) become better. Plus, the humor and charisma with which they deliver the lines still make the lines great.

Carol, however, doesn't deliver these lines with the same humor. Her line in Endgame, for example: ""Because before you didn't have me."" She gives a stern look, and the line is taken very seriously by everyone there. It's a challenge to the Avengers. She's not dealing with a challenge to her character, she's challenging others that we already care a lot about. 

To be fair, it makes sense why she's so arrogant. Immediately after being asked where she's been all this time, she responds by telling them about the number of planets that are going through the same thing as Earth. It makes sense. And that's the difference. Her arrogance hasn't been challenged yet, and there's a good reason for her to be arrogant. Right now, I don't like the character as a person, because she's arrogant, but if that arrogance were to be met with a challenge that would force her to face reality and come over that arrogance, great! All of these other characters that you're mentioning have been on journeys that make them grow as people. Plus, they're adding humor into the mix, which instantly makes people more likable. When Carol's arrogance is challenged, then I really hope she grows and matures as a person, and becomes much more likable. Her only problem so far is ""I forgot everything"" in her own movie. She learned about herself, her past, and the true nature of those she looked up to and counted on. But, her character hasn't really been challenged yet. I'm very open to liking Carol in the future, just not yet.

Natasha is a great example of a female character who, I would argue, is arrogant to some extent, but still faces challenges. She's very confident in her abilities, for a good reason. She's badass, and she delivers her confident lines with a sense of humor and charisma. She still struggles with many things, which is what brings her back down to earth. She's a great, strong character. And that's just one of the many great examples of strong, likable female characters in the MCU. Carol is sure as hell strong, but as of right now, I don't find her very likable, and I hope that changes over her next few movies.",1557546811,"with the look in his eye, and the nod natasha gives, the line is funny, but also arrogant.","funny, but also","funny","but",TRUE,"funny , but also arrogant","arrogant",NA,"also",1

"ekscst9","Something that help me. A therapist told me this a while back. People suffering from PTSD have nightmares because sleeping makes us feel vulnerable. when we are asleep subconsciously we panic and we start having nightmares, sometimes about the trauma, sometimes not. Our body is desperate to wake us up because our mind is terrified at the idea of being vulnerable.

The best thing to do is to talk to a therapist, ask them about EMDR therapy. if you have the energy, try to get some exercise, as much as you can during the day to wear yourself out. it really does help the burn off that anxiety. Take a look at your diet too, if you're tired all the time then you're probably taking a lot of caffeine. You can take a look at reducing that too, I never recommend going off coffee, caffeine is a natural antidepressant and a half cup in the morning doesn't world of good..

But right now, you need some sleep. Even a little bit will help, you need to get past your conscious mind to get to sleep and keep your subconscious mind relaxed while you sleep. Take every precaution to stop either mind from feeling vulnerable. it might not help much, but even a little bit can get you some sleep.
 

To get to sleep, you need to feel safe, surround yourself with anything that comforts you, find the most comfortable place and the safest place to sleep. if you have someone you really trust, ask them to sleep in the same room as you. just surround yourself in a comforting environment. 

Staying asleep, and the nightmares are another problem. This is your subconscious. And it needs to stay relaxed. If you have one, use a vaporizer, it may sound funny but pleasant sents can relax your subconscious.

\*\*Marlina the Murderer in Four Acts\*\* dir. Mouly Surya (2 points)

An Indonesian spaghetti western directed by and starring women. Every frame of this movie is impeccable, everything is just so perfectly framed always. That's a great thing for any movie, but it's especially wonderful for a western that holds on its sweeping vistas letting us just drink in how beautiful it is. I'm struggling to come up with other things to write about this. But it's beautiful, deliberately paced, surprisingly sweet and funny at moments, and not quite as violent as expected for a rape revenge western where the weapons used are machetes. As of now it can be rented on Amazon in the US.

\*\*Tigers Are Not Afraid\*\* dir. Issa Lopez (1 point)

A magical realist story about children living through Mexico’s cartel wars. Beautiful, scary, funny, and super affecting. I'm a sucker for movies about kids and this pulled in my love for horror and magical realism and swirled them all together into a movie that made me both jump at a jump scare and tear up with joy and sadness, sometimes at the same time. And yes, it's definitely similar to Pan's Labyrinth, but the way it brings us into a group of kids and the way that they are genuinely sweet and angry with one another really adds something.

\*\*November\*\* dir. Rainer Sarnet (1 point)

An Estonian folk story, or amalgamation of folk stories. It’s full of different creatures and things that seem absurd to an outsider perspective so I don't know what it means, but it's one of the most gorgeous movies I've ever seen and it made me feel spooked and also made me laugh way more than expected. 

\*\*Annihilation\*\* dir. Alex Garland (1 point)

I won’t say that I understand it but I loved a lot of it, which is maybe why the not great expository dialogue and awkward dialogue in general at many points hurt me more. But hey if you just keep swinging from tension to gore to pretty colors the way this does there’s no way I’m not gonna like it. Also the score and the way it switches in the finale brought me great joy. 

\*\*First Reformed\*\* dir. Paul Schrader (1 point)

Ethan Hawke can eat my ass

On first viewing I walked out of the theater and didn’t want to do anything but just think about the movie for a bit, so that’s a big win. On second viewing it became clear that I love this movie. There's an early conversation where Ethan Hawke's character references my favorite Kierkegaard book that on my first viewing grabbed me and pulled me into the movie, and during my second viewing I couldn't stop thinking ""fuck I love this."" It’s also surprisingly funny. But it doesn’t treat its female characters well at all which is disappointing for a movie this good, and I do not like the ending and it’s weird loving a movie and not liking its ending. 

Honorable mentions:

\*\*Thoroughbreds\*\*, a truly amazing thriller with two fantastic lead performances and a beautifully painful final performance from Anton Yelchin. \*\*Blindspotting\*\*, the best movie about race and gentrification in America in a year that was really good for movies about race and gentrification in America. \*\*Sweet Country\*\*, a beautifully shot Australian western that investigates Australia’s racist history in powerful and often brutal ways. 

Superlatives/oscar snubs:

\*\*Director:\*\* Lynne Ramsey for You Were Never Really Here. While this didn’t make my top 5 or honorable mentions it’s definitely one of my favorites of the year and the only movie that made me think “holy shit she’s a genius” in relation to a director. That moment came during the brothel scene if you’ve seen it. And if you haven’t, please do. I'm glad to see that it's getting a good amount of love here. 

\*\*Actor:\*\* Ethan Hawke in First Reformed. I don’t think this one needs anymore discussion, it’s just ridiculous. And while I didn’t love the movie, Matt Dillon in The House That Jack Built was really fantastic. 

\*\*Actress:\*\* Again didn’t love the movie but Toni Collette was incredible in Hereditary. One thing the Oscars did get right (for me) was nominating all three leads from the Favourite. 

\*\*Cinematography:\*\* If Beale Street Could Talk was the most lush movie I’ve seen since Phantom Thread, which no wasn’t long ago, but they’re both just so gorgeous to look at. 

\*\*Score:\*\* Johann Johansson’s score for Mandy is otherworldly, I’ve loved him for years and cried when he died last year, but he left us with an incredible testament to his genius as his final score. And Annihilation’s score, the way it builds an acoustic world for an hour and a half only to suddenly switch to wonky electronics in the finale is brilliant.

"eft59zu","People are already proposing ammunition taxes and trying to gut the 2nd any chance they get- it's clearly treated as a 2nd class right by half this country (the other half unfortunately treats \*all the other rights\* as 2nd class rights though, which is funny but tragic). Ex: Connecticut State Senator introducing a bill to tax ammunition sales to 50% of their price. That's very clearly a tax designed to discourage people from owning guns (and exercising their 2nd Amendment rights).

&gt;  There’s no broad support for bans and confiscation. The poor need to eat. The vulnerable need protected. We all get it. 

My personal problem is that there's already too many people who want \*less\* guns in society. There isn't really a way to get there other than 2 options: 

1. Restrict the right of the 2nd Amendment or physically take their guns away.
2. Make America so safe that nobody will feel the need to own a handgun for protection

FWIW I'm ok with a registry of handguns, given that they're clearly favored in firearms-related crime. I would just like more than just some politicans' assurance that they won't abuse said registry sometime in the distant future. Ideally I'd like to also have the ability to own a suppressed pistol in all 50 states but maybe we could negotiate for that and a handgun registry?

In Russia we have some character of Nicolas Nosov's childish book - ""Незнайка"". Don't know how to translate it correctly with English morphology, it is name founded with russian ""не знаю"" - person, who's name says, that he know nothing. Незнайка is rather silly and funny, but lucky person, he personifies russian iamge of themselves. And this character is icon of ""авось"": one of his most favorite phrases is ""И так сойдёт!"", which means that he do something without thinking about the consequences.
I think you can understand better what we mean while saying ""На авось"" if you read some of his adventures if you have time for it :) ",1543148593,"незнайка is rather silly and funny, but lucky person, he personifies russian iamge of themselves.","silly and funny","funny",NA,FALSE,"rather silly and funny","silly",NA,"rather",0

"e4o31cy","Seriously girl, if I could stay physically 25 with my self-confidence at 38 I'd be banging half of Hollywood but unfortunately so must of my youthful hotness was wasted on my insecurities.  So don't be me!  Now I give no fucks, but gravity does.  Even so, it's not hard to find men who want to have sex.  It won't ever be.  That part is actually really easy once you decide to do it.

If you actually want a good partner, that's where the effort and luck comes in.  In some ways you're probably better off than a lot of ""more experienced"" girls your age, because women who start dating young are conditioned to take shit from dudes.  You're not, so keep that awesome sense of self and healthy boundaries.  I don't want to scare you off from dating, because it can be super fun and if you want to have a serious partner eventually, that is also an awesome thing to have, but in the meantime there will be assholes.  There are a lot of assholes out there. But there are great guys, too.

I'm going to leave you with what I think is an inspirational story that is 100%.  My BFF is a deeply insecure woman.  She worries about hair, her weight, her awkwardness, everything.  She probably has undiagnosed General Anxiety Disorder.  She's wonderful, warm, and funny, but of course that means nothing to her because she spent most of her life feeling self-conscious about her body.  I met her at 32.  At 36 she'd never had a serious relationship, but she'd spent her interactions with men in her 20s and early 30s in various inebriated states due to her anxiety and self-hatred and it wasn't working out great for her, to say the least.

She'd been on and off Tinder for a couple of years and had some awful experiences, a combination of her not being able to stand up for herself and being a romantic so putting up with some real awful, red-flag behavior.  She hated her body and never liked sex at all aside from it making her feel wanted.  She'd never let a hookup see her in full light. 

Well, in the midst of one of her particularly toxic, 2 week whirlwind romances with a genuinely disturbed dude (he literally committed himself to a mental institution and begged her to ""wait for him"") she went on a casual date with a nice guy who she'd chatted on and off again on Twitter about travel and such, and she claimed she only went on the date to confirm her feelings for the guy in the loony bin .  

Well, 2 years later my sex-hating, self-body-shaming, prudish friend not only loves taking long showers with her partner, who she now lives with, she actually really likes sex, loves being naked around him, and enjoys bragging about all of this to us, her long-married friends who wistfully long for those days of passion. 

I mean, I'm talking about a girl who hated her boobs so much she refused to take off her bra during sex until this guy rolled up.  But he changed something in her and made her insecurities melt away but what I'm saying is don't wait for a guy for that to happen.  I'm convinced that the only reason she got with this guy is because she was already ""in love"" with the loony bin dude and that helped her project confidence and shushed up her neediness long enough for him to become smitten with her.  Oh also this dude is objectively hot and 6 years younger than her and makes really good money and as her friend my complaint about him is that he's ""too responsible"".  She didn't settle for a loser, she just apparently starred in her own chick-lit novel.  

I just share this because I spent years holding her hand through terrible short-lived relationships and I was convinced that her self-loathing would prevent her from ever finding a healthy situation or get over her body issues and then it just happened and it's like, what?!  OK, great!!  And not that relationships are the be-all-and-end-all but the fact that if this girl can get over her issues to the point where she walks around naked in full daylight in front of a man while making stupid inside jokes, literally anyone can get there, too.

"e2eschd","Honestly, I think the comedy is talked about too often, if anything. I mean, his novels are consistently funny, but so many people talk about Pynchon as if ridiculous antics and comedic shenanigans are all he has to offer. In my experience, the absurdity and comedy serves an important purpose within the narrative: to hide the overwhelming melancholy running beneath the surface of each one of his novels. Particularly the long, dense novels, and especially Gravity's Rainbow. That novel is truly tragic in the purest sense, but it's nearly impossible to notice that with only one read. My first read had me laughing out loud every few pages and scratching my head for many more, but my second read through was honestly a very emotional experience and brought me close to tears a few times. He tends to be labeled as a cold author and I feel like the people saying that likely didn't read very closely or read only the once. Against the Day has some incredibly touching scenes and some genuinely sad moments interspersed throughout the almost comically overdone adventure-novel tone, and Mason &amp; Dixon has probably the most beautiful and heartbreaking/warming depiction of a budding friendship in any novel I've read and the brooding tone serves as an amazing launching pad for some true levity that I feel people tend to overlook. When people call Pynchon dense, they usually mean the language, themes, philosophy, and plot-structure. What gets left out is how truly dense they are in terms of emotional depth. It's hard to grasp every emotion he's putting the reader through in each work the first time through because there are just so many, sometimes going back and forth multiple times in a single paragraph, just like it's hard to grasp all of the metaphors, puns, wordplay, jargon, and philosophy on each page. I recommend any fan of his go back through GR one more time, not as a comedy but as a tragedy. It's an absurd retelling of one of the most brutal and horrific times in world history, and through that absurdity he managed, in my opinion, in his own incomparable way, to write something somehow more accurate and True at its heart than any realist fiction could have accomplished. 

He's very likely my favorite author of all time, but not for a lack of trying to find another to take that place. Some will surely disagree with me, but I hope they give his work a real chance first. Not just for the novelty of the work or for the challenge of his prose, but because I (and many others, obviously) really do believe there very well may be more to unpack in those ~800 pages than you'll find in any other work of art, in any medium. 

I'm not really disagreeing with you, by the way, and I apologize for writing an essay nobody asked for in response to your reasonable comment, I just couldn't help myself.

**Pat Boivin from Super Best Friends (a popular gaming/LP channel on Youtube):** ""The secret is that I !@#$ing hate Let's Plays. *I can't stand them*. The only Let's Play ever I think is any good is Jurassic Park Trespasser by Research Indicates. It's the only one that I actually watched and was like 'I enjoyed this...'""

The comment was made mostly in jest, but the video series he talked up has been a pretty big cult hit, popular with viewers and many content creators large and small who still tout its quality to this day, often referring to it as ""the best."" It was first posted to the SA Forums on Apr. 6, 2008 (it was originally posted to Vimeo and Viddler), Barely a year into a year into the concept Let's Play as we know it. While most people were still pointing webcams at TVs and covering their screens with recording watermarks and giant mouse cursors over endless Kaizo and The Guy deaths (that or trying to rip off AVGN), Research did a high-effort documentary-style playthrough of a very quirky, very flawed Jurassic Park FPS. 

Besides Research having a good voice, the commentary is a good mix of informative and funny but the creator only really speaks when he think he has something valuable to say.  The game itself was a disaster overall but there were some cool and interesting parts to it that he shows off, and it saves someone from having to play such a messy game while still giving the viewer the chance to see what experiences it has to offer.

In my view everyone that puts his/her love of knowledge in action should be deemed a Philosopher. One who is merely studying other philosophers without putting what was learned in practice through his/her own unique view of it is practicing ""love for the ""love of knowledge"""", a philophilosophia if you will, with too much philos, and not enough sophia. These I would say are the vast majority, the ones you righly labelled in your OP as ""believers"".

"dtepua2","Georginio Wijnaldum remembers standing in the club canteen at Feyenoord when a woman he had never seen before suddenly approached him and delivered the most unexpected of introductions.

Ushered forward was another boy, a little younger than himself, maybe ten years old, small and quiet. The moment was initially awkward and Wijnaldum, who had just finished playing a youth game for the visitors Sparta Rotterdam, stood and stared. Here before him was the half-brother he had heard about, but had never previously met.

“Growing up I was with the side of my mother, and my grandmother, and not a lot with the family of my father, so that is why we didn’t see each other,” Wijnaldum explained. “I knew I had another brother, but I never saw him until that moment. I never saw pictures because at that time you didn’t have the internet or social media. There was no Instagram or Facebook or anything.

“She came to me and told me he was Rajiv. In the beginning I didn’t speak. I was looking at him. But I was also happy because I could finally see him. I went to play a game, but I found my brother.”

Wijnaldum is sitting on a hotel sofa as he recounts the story, unravelling the ties that lie on the side of his father, Ramon. Next to him is Rajiv van La Parra, smiling, laughing and confirming the story of how his mother, Ruth, orchestrated the get-together.

They hug when they meet, each tapping their chest close to the heart after the embrace in what seems a twist on modern-day handshake routines, and immediately strike up a conversation.

The next time they are together, it will be as rivals, with Liverpool travelling to Huddersfield Town tomorrow, both sides clamouring for victory to bolster their Premier League campaigns. The friendship of the respective managers, Jürgen Klopp and David Wagner, runs deep, but this is a blood bond strengthened over time.

Van La Parra and Wijnaldum lived in different areas of Rotterdam and were too young after that first meeting to make their way across the city and hang out regularly. Later, when Wijnaldum was headhunted by Feyenoord, the youngsters, by now 13 and 14, would see each other at school every day and train together on Tuesdays and Thursdays.

There would be sleepovers at each other’s houses, a football never far away, and theirs was a relationship that would be cemented and survive the geographical distance that would later be put between them.

“When he came to play for Feyenoord we saw each other more often and we were closer,” Van La Parra, the younger of the two by eight months, said. “I would go to his house with my younger brother and he would come to our house to see the grandmother and then we had more of a connection. Down the years we grew closer.

“There were no fights. He was a really nice guy. Always you see him smiling now and he was like that as a child. I have never really seen him angry.

Wijnaldum has scored seven goals in 70 appearances in all competitions for LiverpoolWijnaldum has scored seven goals in 70 appearances in all competitions for Liverpool
BRADLEY ORMESHER/THE TIMES
“And I don’t think you want to see him angry because usually the people who are really nice, when they are angry, they are crazy.”

Van La Parra does not disguise his admiration for Wijnaldum’s career: Feyenoord, PSV Eindhoven, Newcastle United, now an important cog in Liverpool’s team and full Holland international. Each move a step up, each challenge negotiated.

“I know a lot of players who at that young age were also as good as him but they didn’t make it,” said Van La Parra. “You can see that his full potential came out and his mentality [helped him]. He knew straight away what he wanted, and anything that could set him back, he distanced himself from that. He could see at the end the result, and he plays now for Liverpool, a really big club, and he deserved it all.

“People only see that now. But I know, and saw also from close [up], he had a lot of struggles during this journey and to reach this level makes it now more special. If I look at him I am really proud of what he achieved.”

Less conventional has been Van La Parra’s own pathway. He signed his first professional contract with Caen, moving to northern France with his mother after being spotted playing for Holland Under-17 in a tournament in Spain.

Three years later he returned to the Netherlands with Heerenveen and there followed spells with Wolverhampton Wanderers, Brighton &amp; Hove Albion on loan, and then Huddersfield, whom he joined at the start of their promotion season and where he has become integral. “A lot of times you see that when a player leaves Holland and they go at a young age to another league they do not succeed,” Wijnaldum, whose other brother, Giliano Wijnaldum, has recently joined the Dutch side Willem II, said. “They disappear. The way that he came to the Premier League was harder than the way I have to come to Liverpool. I play always for big teams, I didn’t try another country until 24, so I was always in my comfort zone with my family close to me.

“His journey was more difficult than mine so I am really proud of that. A lot of people see me as a role model, but I think he is also a role model for players who want to go at a young age to try a different path.”

They have shared a pitch as team-mates playing for Holland Under-21, that squad including Daley Blind, Patrick van Aanholt, Leroy Fer and Luciano Narsingh, and Van La Parra jokes: “I played on the wing and Gini in midfield. He didn’t give me the ball. He always passed to the other side.”

But it is telling that both agree that the pride of that achievement was outweighed by the personal time spent together. “The football is nice, but I liked the time off the pitch in hotels with him,” said Wijnaldum as Van La Parra nodded alongside. “Of course, if you think about it, one of the great things you can have is to play in a team with your brother.

“But football is something you do every day, every moment, it is something that is serious. Off the pitch you can be easy, play games, laugh. You don’t have to think about results and you enjoy the moment more.

“He is funny, but also smart. He makes a lot of jokes and, in that case, he is like my father who wants to make a lot of jokes and make fun of people. He always stayed the same since he was young. He never changed.”

Van La Parra added: “People say, ‘Do you speak to Gini about football?’ But other than, ‘How’s it going?’ we talk about other things. The worst thing about him is maybe he is too nice in some situations. Sometimes people try to use him because he is so nice. They take advantage of him. But he is really talented and a family man.”

In their personal duels, first shaped by PSV’s tussles with Heerenveen, Wijnaldum leads 4-1, with Liverpool’s 3-0 victory at Anfield in October stretching his superiority.

Van La Parra is hoping to close the gap and end a run of six league games without a win for Huddersfield, but is wary that Liverpool would be seeking to make amends for their loss away to the bottom club Swansea City last week even before Saturday’s FA Cup defeat by West Bromwich Albion. “For this game they are more triggered to get the win,” he said.

A clash of training schedules meant that plans for this interview had to be postponed from before the last meeting, but after getting together on neutral territory in Manchester’s Lowry Hotel [José Mourinho’s des res and Alexis Sánchez’s temporary abode] they stayed on for some impromptu lunch and to chat some more.

There is time for one more potential scenario to be set: Van La Parra is through on goal in the 90th minute at the John Smith’s Stadium tomorrow, so what happens next?

“I take him down,” said Wijnaldum, bursting into a trademark toothy grin before revealing his meticulous side by checking what type of foul would earn a one-match suspension and what might land him a three-game ban.

“It depends on the score. If we are two goals up, he can score. Otherwise, I take the red card.”",1517229596,"van la parra admits to some envy about his half brother’s career van la parra admits to some envy about his half brother’s career peter powell/reuters “he is funny, but also smart.","funny, but also","funny","but",TRUE,"funny , but also smart","smart",NA,"also",1

"dt4zgcy","I have no idea how things actually work on a movie production, but I imagine there are lots of conversations with the director and the cinematographer and the editor. The cinematographer and editor will have a vision and ideas for how they think things should look but the director ultimately has the last say. Pretty much everything falls under the director's purview to some extent as they're the overseer of the entire endeavor. But they also have to leave a lot up to the individual cinematographers and editors as well since they have lots of other things to oversee. So I think ultimately doing an extra-long take, or a unique editing approach doesn't make or break the film's direction. However, I think how a director inserts something like that into their film and the choices they make around that is what's important. I see a director as someone who takes a script, actors, cinematography, score, etc. and assembles those pieces to construct a complete package. Some directors are more involved in some aspects, like editing, than others but the point of a director is keeping the style, tone, and message of the movie consistent. It's not one or two unique shots that make a movie great. If the director wants that and fits it into the movie in a way that's consistent with the rest of the film then that's good, but if they decide that the movie doesn't require that then that's also good. Lady Bird is all about the main character's relationships with the people around her, crazy technical shots or unique editing approaches aren't necessary to tell that story and I think they would actually distract from the heart of the movie. I think Greta Gerwig did an excellent job directing this movie. The movie is paced very well, there are no bad performances, but overall it keeps the tone consistent, it's light-hearted and funny, but also realistic, sweet, and sad at times. Overall a very bitter-sweet movie. And it captures the overall feel of what the main character is experiencing in her life. And this is all done through a great interweaving of many different aspects including cinematography, editing, acting, music, set design, costumes, etc. I think her nomination is very well deserved.

Sweet Summer fades out of existence
While Autumn takes over the business
Rebranding it all, nicknaming it 'Fall'
But surely, she'll need some assistance.

The flowers and grasses they've laid in?
Their flourish, their flair is now fading.
Prepared to retire, but not yet expire,
It seems it's first frost they're evading.

They plaintively cry to the trees
'Protect us, oh willn't you please?
Oranges and yellows make pleasant bedfellows,
So blanket our beds with your leaves!'

The trees are a sight to behold.
Now emerald! Now auburn! Now gold!
In one long encore, just a few shivers more
Leaves them naked, but ah! who can scold?

The wind is a clever enchantress
She flits and she floats and she dances
She nips at the beasts, warns them to retreat
""It's nearly that time, take no chances!""

The beasties have heard this fair warning
Gather in the food they've been storing
So no cold bites their bones, they'll spruce up their homes:
The dens and the caves and the warrens.

So, you see, it's not all without effort
Miss Autumn's employees are clever.

"di7hx3u","Had one of the seniors streak through the school in a wrestling mask when I was a freshman. Yelled ""catch me if you can bitch. I oiled up before this"" at the school officer pushing his way through the crowd of students. 

Had another kid in my French class stand up and say "" miss this paper is a piece of sheet"". Teach tells him to gtfo, he refuses. Calls the principals, still refuses to leave and taunts them for not getting his name right. Cops come in, still refuses to leave. They think he's whacked out on acid or something but the guy was just protesting the fact that all this shit was happening because he made a joke. 

Saw the same kid stop traffic to throw snowballs at cars after class in January of freshman year. That same year I convinced him that if he ate an entire eraser he could have my (newish at the time) xbox360.... He only ate half, followed me home and loitered outside of my house with a stick for a half hour before I threw ten bucks out my door and told him to fuck off. 

In elementary school he purposefully pissed himself and chased kids (and teachers) around with his pissy hands. 

In the fourth grade he identified as a squirrel for the ENTIRE year. He kind of rekindled that passion during senior year when he got really into parkour. Guy was in a tree like most of the time. This got to the point that he scaled the outside of the school during his spare, climbing past three stories of classrooms full of kids.... That one had the Cops involved again, but the school was REALLY hard to climb and they didnt have any ladders on hand anywhere near tall enough. They kinda just yelled at him to get the fuck down until he eventually got bored and complied...he still got to walk and graduate a couple weeks later so I don't really know if he was charged with anything.

2. The megathreads. Yeah, ill agree, they are a good idea **WHEN THE COMMUNITY IS BIG ENOUGH**.

With mega threads, you habe to actively seek the questionswith the intent of answering.

3. You dont judge posts individually. Someone could get 8 econs legit and apparently thats not interesting, cause you mods would within seconds delete the post for breaking the reward rules.

"dh0rips","If you want my honest opinion, I want more discussions over memes and actual content being posted here.

As for memes I want them to be high quality with a lot of effort put into them. Also reposting them and re hashing them I don't want that here either as that takes away the originality of the original content creator that took the time to actually make the high quality meme in the first place.

The copy pasta of the heads of the characters imo is a no go for me. Anyone with basic photoshop knowledge can take a picture, paste it over something, make it look fancy and add a few text and then call it good.

But the mod team all have different point of views on what they think is acceptable.

Take example the Star Wars cross over meme. Some of them think this is a funny and ok meme. Me personally, it's kind of funny, but there's no originality in it. I personally would have removed it.

Another thing is it feels like For Honor has become a karma haven where people can post simple memes and gain a lot of up votes. The thing is. The community is what makes the Reddit, so the mod team can only enforce what the community wants. This isn't my personal community either so I can't enforce my beliefs unto others.

Since we're a team and the majority of the mod team like most of the memes here, then we'll have to work together on improving things.

The best thing I can do is get one of our CSS mods to add the flair and filter the memes and then introduce a high quality only rule and then direct only low quality shit posts and memes to the other subreddit the. Proceed to get a bot to delete all unflaired posts after 5 mins.

But what's the difference from a low quality meme and a very high quality meme to the majority?

"dgaprni","*disclaimer, I am not under NDA, I don't have access to the beta. So ofcourse none of what I say can be said as accurate. :P

The game looks ok, there just is not a lot to it right now in terms of gameplay, just death match and team deathmatch, pretty bland modes for a new player. And from all the leaked videos out there that I have seen (and there has been a lot) the real test is perhaps in how all the back end stuff works, like the loot boxes, player equipment and the match-making. Everything looks to have a good polish. But as they have not shown any different or new modes yet, there really doesn't seem to be a lot to talk about gameplay-wise. Except ofcourse how the abilities effect the game, but the only ""this game is really good/bad"" kind of information you'll see is battling opinions saying such and such's ability is OP or too weak or whatever, or someone saying abilities are great, and another saying they suck etc etc. But these additional abilities are new, and probably not yet well-founded, so it may be useless discussing their current form.

Anyway, you can see the videos for yourselves and today it feels like Bethesda/ID are slacking off from enforcing take-downs on youtube. But that's just right now.

"dft9lyz","Put a hat down in front of your performing area, and throw some change in it to start with. That lets passers-by know your busking. A hat with change in it is the Universal Sign of the Busker! Everyone knows it!

Then, carry on with what you are doing right now with silent magic. If your choices are good, and your magic skills are decent, people will stop and watch. Magic just has that effect. 

FYI - Chinese Linking Rings has angle problems if you are not using a Locking Key Ring. People behind you will see how its done. So, if you are going to carry on doing it, either get yourself a Locking Key Ring, or be aware of where your angle problems are. 

If at all possible, if your performing area is licensed to have live music, get a Ghetto Blaster and play some loud music (Under no circumstances DO NOT USE RAP or Gangsta! Choose Middle-of-the-Road stuff. Something everyone knows. Your choice of music is actually critical - if the public don't like it, they will leave just to get away from it. Funny but true!). Turn it off once you've got a captive audience. 

If passers by don't see your magic taking place, the music will alert them that ""something"" is going on. Curiosity will get the better of them, and they will actively seek out what the music is for. 

However, sadly, as most public places no longer have licenses to have live music, you will probably have to ignore all of the above as worthless advice!

A domain like that has actually no value except that it looks great on ads or printing material.

If you get a .us, or .co, .ca or some other country code, it will look even better because it’s just 2 characters long vs most new extensions. The term nTLD is what name.com and some registrars coined for the new approved extensions, while technically they are all gTLD’s. I personally have over 50 new extensions and I also offer and sell them to my customers. I have no motivation here to bash them but I'm honest with them if they ask me for advice. 

If you think people on Reddit are the only ones that dislike them you may be also be wrong. Internet users are not dumb and most people were aware it was all just about extra money, not to actually benefit any new web presence online. This is exactly why they can charge whatever they want, including higher prices for those that own premium names. Worse, you can get a domain today for a normal price and they can decide its premium tomorrow and you must start paying $100,000 a year to keep it. If that is not immoral I don't know what is. And if you are not aware, the owner of Uniregistry is actually on a killing spree buying .com names, I wonder why. If you have $100,000 for a domain, just go to Sedo or any other aftermarket and you will get an amazing .com today, and the best is that it’s not going to cost you $100,000 next year to renew as opposed to those new TLD's. I honestly think some of the companies running the new domains must thing we are all idiots.

When various characters appeared such as the Fly, you could consider adding a funny but informative title in maybe the bottom right such as: Ex: ""Trap Fly: &lt;funny one line description&gt;""

The dancing scene at the end could have been cut a bit shorter as well.

"ddgmof5","I'd just like to weigh in on the types of posts allowed and specifically megathreads and newbies. I personally have no issue with posts of all kinds showing up in this or any sub, and don't feel they need to be restricted to just megathreads and such. Such threads can be great learning resources, but if you start having a dedicated threat or even new sub for every kind of post people might have, then exactly what kind of content is left for general posting?

As an example, in one of the more popular video game subs I frequent, it's not uncommon to see a lot of people complaining that most of the content in the sub is of one or two types regularly, and they're not really wrong. Some of it is bandwagoning, but a large part of the problem is over time a lot of what I think of as ""general"" content got shuffled out to other more specific subs (again, this is a video game), but all fan fiction, pvp discussion, sharing of character pics, and a few other things all got booted to their own specific subs. All that's left to talk about in the main is balance issues and speculating on upcoming content. 

Here, I think we should be free to share our successes, failures, ideas and discoveries. What content is ok and what isn't I think should probably revolve around what's potentially useful or educational or at least amusing, and what's just noise. Yeah, the occasional spaghetti pic is funny, but too many gets boring fast, especially with no context that might at least be of use, but I also don't think that means they need to be outright banned.

"daajplj","I fear I'll never find my favorite kind of game again. When I was younger, I absolutely loved games like **Runescape and Mabinogi** because they had the most living worlds I could find. The trick with games that encourage exploration is that they rarely leave any reason to return to the places you've already been. Everything is packaged up nice and neatly into zones that are level-bound, and once you're past that level range, being there is just a waste of time.

For all the crap they get, RS and Mabi definitely did something right in terms of never making you feel like you've ""completed"" an area. There's always more quests left (Maybe small in scale or reward, but never meaningless.) and NPCs were non-player *characters* rather than living mailboxes for quest requests. One of the things that I, to this day, consider to be one of the best design choices *in gaming* is the right-click menu in Runescape. Everything has two shared options - use and examine. Every item has flavor text, but you have to make a conscious, in-character decision to look at it and see what you can glean from the item. Sometimes it's a funny but pointless bit of humor, sometimes it's insight into the world, and sometimes it's a subtle hint. Combine that with the ability to ""use"" any item on any other item and suddenly everything is covered in possibility. 99% of the time when you use two random items together, they do nothing. That makes sense. But it's figuring out that you can just combine two half doses of a potion into the same vial that makes it interesting. It's your axe head breaking off, then fixing it by reattaching the head to the handle. It's using a tinderbox with some logs to start a fire, then trying to cook something you found on it, or picking up the ashes to chalk your hands before your character goes to try shotput. *Nothing* feels like there's only one possible use. Things simply are what they are.

As the obsession with huge open worlds has continued, large worlds became a tick-box rather than a style of game. They're thrown in the game as features like a leveling system in a game that doesn't need one. They're marketing before they're game features. Combine that with the advent of procedurally-generated crap, towns and dungeons become something disturbingly similar to a ""Find your elf name!"" chart you'd see on facebook. You get a seed (Your name/birthday) and a finite amount of equally dull responses, are entertained for a moment, then move on.

One of the reasons I enjoyed the original **Dark Souls** was that it had a lot of what I wanted. The two closest areas to Firelink shrine are super-lategame areas, for example. There's a character in the game who has a story about his own meaninglessness *who still has more fucking meaning that 99% of the characters in modern gaming.* Few/none of the weapons are completely useless unless their very purpose is to be useless. The game isn't afraid of you missing Ash Lake, and never tells you about Shiva's craziness. The witch's ring's only purpose could only be figured out through coincidence (or incredibly sharp lore-sense) and even then, it's only a story usage. That story usage, though, is *intensely* cool and memorable. Hell, there's even the pendant. It's completely and utterly useless in every way known to gaming, but its very existence spawned so many stories and experiences.

**Stardew Valley** was a breath of fresh air. It embodied a lot of what I liked about games in this style; combat is a part of life, not the point of life. Areas don't freeze in time when you're gone, people aren't a checklist of objectives to tick off, and progression is solely based on what kind of things you like to do with your time. I thought **Black Desert** might be able to deliver that kind of experience, but similarly to **Archeage**, I was left disappointed.

So, is there anybody out there with similar taste in games that could throw me a bone? Something I could really throw myself at.

"d8z5z5v","1. Katya - because she was amazing and she has come so far since season 7 and I think she was unfairly judged in some challenges and lipsyncs.  She was hilarious in everything she did, her confessionals were the best and she had me laughing my head off every time she was on screen.  Apart from that speech on the finale, she brought the feels.  Her Bjork was so good, totally on point.  And I fucking love her. 

2. Detox - because I think she did fantastic in these challenges.  I loved the majority of her runway looks and the way she handled herself with the whole Rolaskatox thing was brilliant.  She did amazing and she deserved her top 3 place.

3. Tatianna - I think she was wrongly sent home twice.  Her spoken word was everything, it showed how smart and funny she is, her T-Boz was perfect and that lipsync with Alyssa was easily the best lipsync of the whole season.  She was great in season 2 but so much better in all stars. 

4. Alyssa - she is a class act and an amazing queen. And she brought it.  That Annie Oakley was tremendous, she killed that challenge! And I've already mentioned the lipsync with Tati. Alyssa was so much fun this season and she made it so entertaining. 

5. Alaska - she came to compete and compete she did.  Her snatch game was fantastic from start to finish.  Lil Poundcake was inspired, hated the bin bag look before it but Lil Poundcake was such a good move.  Her Baby JJ was so funny.  But I was so disposable in her in those last few episodes when she was acting spoiled and entitled.  It soured her win for me, I went into this season with her in my top three but when she won I felt very deflated and meh. But I still love her and am still a fan but she isn't my number 1. 

6. Adore - despite leaving in episode 2 I'm still putting her in 6th place.  From her walking in the workroom with her Meow and her grunge look to her leaving i loved seeing Adore.  I love that she came in dresses like that, that is who she is and I love it.  I couldn't believe she came in the bottom for the talent show, she has a much better voice than all the other singers and her song was beautiful.  I love her makeup and I think she always looks beautiful.  I'm proud of her for sticking to her feelings and walking away when she felt it was the right thing to do.  And she has been looking so stunning lately, I think if she had stayed she would have done so well in this competition. 

7. Phi - until her last episode I didn't think she was coming across that badly.  I think her talent is unbelievable and she has come so far since season 4.  Her looks are brilliantly constructed and she is so creative it's genius.  I hope she continues to show that off.  

8. Roxxxy - despite being in the bottom all the time she came across so much better than in her season.  And she knows how to slay an outfit.  And I am still gagging over her entrance, everything about that was beautiful, the outfit, the hair, the face.  She is stunning and I'm so pleased she got to play the game the right way.   

9. Coco - I applaud her for trying something different for her talent and she has been so funny through this season, without all that Alyssa - Coco drama I think we got a chance to see her talent as a queen. 

10. Ginger - I do love Ginger but I felt she was a little meh this season, could be editing could be that she was a little meh. I love her as a queen but I wanted more from her this season.

* Tatianna's snatch game was good not because of the looks and gestures, but because she had witty answers, which can carry over to any snatch game. [Watch it again.] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ryuRXTogEc) She definitely has the skills to turn it out.

Her parents had told her she was not allowed to tell anyone how her sister died, since they didn't want her younger siblings to know, so she had always kept it to herself.

NO. FUCKING STOP. THAT'S NOT FUNNY AND EVEN IF IT WERE, YOU'RE NOT FUNNY FOR DOING IT. FUCK OFF. I HATE Lalafels because they always think they're so FUCKING FUNNY and they ARE NOT, EVER. They aren't the only ones that pull this shit, trust me I realize, but they are the biggest offenders. Second is usually Roegadens.

BuhuhuhurhurhuHURHUR IT'S NOT FUCKING FUNNY OR CUTE OR CLEVER.

The fucking piss icing on this shit cake is these players are usually the ones who are hyper aggressive, excessively crude, and in general are unpleasant to be around. That Roe with the leopard print thong glamour, he's the one telling you to kill yourself in party chat and going on about how he fucked your mom. Not funny. Never will be funny. They think they are funny but they are the highest tier of obnoxious and I have no love for people like this.

I don't hate Lalafels, I hate the internet culture in which we all have to be funny. Level with yourself, if you can't be charming and witty and funny then you may not be funny. Don't opt to be aggressive and obnoxious to create the illusion of being funny. Just accept that not everyone is funny and be charming and fun instead. Take the high ground. Making a Lala, giving him a goofy green mustache and naming him Fuq Lord and then wearing a thong and then shouting in Idylshire about paying Elezen women for giraffe jobs IS NOT YOU BEING FUNNY.

Richmond v Gold Coast (MCG) 3.20pm

So with both teams’ seasons over, I’m going to forgo my usual stats driven, footy tactics analysis and mention how both coaches have said in the past fortnight their teams can make the finals.

Look, I’m into delusion as much as the next person. Delusion is how we get through the day.

My number one “life hack” if I could talk like an annoying moron for a second, is caffeine and delusion, in equal measure.

But even at my best, I don’t think I could match the performances of Eade and Hardwick.

I hope they are just saying it because they have to. The alternative is they’re so far removed from reality that it’s technically another dimension.

I guess self-belief is important to achieve things in this world though. It just so rarely works.

My self-belief has led me to a series of crushing defeats, each worse than the one before and a rather unpleasant re-occurring rash.

I guess I just described the life of a Richmond supporter.

Anyway, Tigers to win this.

Greater Western Sydney v Sydney (SS) 4.40pm

Apparently, this matchup is no longer called the Battle of the Bridge. They’re calling it something else but I can’t be bothered googling it because who cares?

They should call it the Battle of the Giant-Swans in the hope some Sydneysiders mistakenly think it’s a fight between some enlarged waterfowl and decide to head along.


The Battle of the Bridge is why Buddy moved to Sydney. Picture: Getty
Personally, if I heard giant swans were engaging in battle I’d actually consider travelling to western Sydney.

When these two last met, the Swans just squeezed the life out of the Giants over four quarters. They really didn’t let them run everywhere like some clubs do.

That was at the SCG and this will be a bit tougher at the Giants home ground. Mainly because of the travel. Thanks to Sydney’s infrastructure, the travel time for the Swans is comparable to an away game in Perth.

I still think Sydney are a class above the Giants but this will be incredibly close.

Monday

Melbourne v Collingwood (MCG) 3.20pm

The Queen’s Birthday clash is about as relevant as having a public holiday for the Queen’s

birthday.

Yes, I know it’s not really the Queen’s birthday. Everyone knows that, stop pointing it out all the time Greg.

Melbourne fans are dreading this match. They’re favourites, which means an almost certain loss and the chance of Travis Cloke kicking five-odd is a clear and present danger.


Tipping Melbourne is fraught with danger. Picture: Getty
The Demons just have to get this done. All the talk of improvement is fine but the fans want to see a team that can handle games like this regularly. Not fail to show up at all.

Collingwood’s already disastrous season could really escalate if they lose this.

While injuries have played a part, the Pies have been terrible all year. Funny but terrible.

I look at them and can’t see a lot of upside either. Who are their key forwards? Jesse White and Travis Cloke? It’s laughable that people rated them.

Collingwood have actually lost their last two games against Melbourne. Let that sink in.

I’m tipping Melbourne here but be warned, doing so is fraught with danger.

I always thought TV tropes would be better, if they explained things in a straightforward manner, but they don't. They explain using sentences, where the explanation is twisted around to fit the trope name of a related trope. But the trope name often isn't sufficient explanation, so you have to go and open *that* trope's page, and read that, in order to understand the first.

But because so many of the pages are written using this poor communication method, you will often have to open one (or more) pages off of that *second* page, to understand *it* (which you were only reading to understand the first one, in the first place.)

"d31jmbb","I would disagree - it is not a matter of social conditioning that we can change. Humans find certain traits attractive because those traits are linked to fertility, survival and good parenting. There is so much research on this topic I find it staggering that anyone with an interest is not already aware.

It is not that humans find certain traits attractive because culture glorifies them; our culture glorifies certain traits because humans find them attractive.

There are many examples of people who are in love or in a relationship with someone who is not classically attractive, or indeed is classically ugly. This happens because the more attractive someone is, the more attractive a mate they can secure. Attractiveness is also not the same in both sexes - women are more valued for their fertility traits, while men are more valued for their survival traits. So an overweight woman with an ugly face might only be able to attract a weak, submissive man with a dead-end job. His face might well be pretty, but men are not valued very highly for this in comparison to their psychological traits.

"d2g1fcp","This isn't your original question, but because you're talking diet &amp; exercise:

Diet: Meet with a doctor knowledgeable in nutrition (not a GP). Talk about any health issues you may have, your activity level at the gym &amp; your long-term weight loss &amp; fitness goals. A nutritionist will give you a plan (not just one meal to eat over &amp; over). If you're trying to better yourself, then this is a lifestyle change, not 6 months of eating boiled chicken then back to your old eating habits. You need strategies for eating out at restaurants, days you don't feel like cooking, special celebration days, etc... basically, how to make this stick in your life. Once you've established what your daily caloric intake should be, you can use apps to help you track it until you get the hang of it.

Exercise: Meet with a trainer. Lots of folks new to exercise tend to overdo it &amp; are at higher risk of injury. If you're lifting weights or using machines, the trainer will show you proper technique so you're working the right muscles &amp; not putting your body at risk. Also talk about knowing the difference between ""good burn"" &amp; ""I'm going to injure myself if I don't stop now"" so you don't push too hard.

Lastly, you may need some resources once you start losing weight. If you're used to seeing yourself as the ""funny but overweight"" guy, you may need help seeing yourself differently. It takes time to start seeing your ""new body"" when you look in the mirror &amp; to feel like you're that person instead of who you always have been.

Soldier is the [Cloud Cuckoolander](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Cloudcuckoolander/VideoGames), pretty standard and incredibly funny, but not what I would consider best either. Pyro also applies to this!

Demo is drunk and has mother and father issues, not much more can be said there, I wish they'd flesh him out a little more.

Heavy is definitely the most interesting one, I'd say, because he just wants to protect his family at any cost and would sacrifice anything to help them. That's really sweet of him, and anyone can relate to that! :D In game he's way crazier, but I suppose that's because he REALLY loves his gun, he gets a bit too passionate sometimes!

Engineer is...a mystery, moreso than the Spy I'd say, because we know barely anything about him, and he seems to play a large role in the whole Gray-Mann-issue.

Medic is a crazy German and does everything he does just because he wants to see what will happen. He also likes pain and gore a lot :D I'm a big fan of him, also because of his accent, but I guess I am a bit biased on that front :P

Sniper also has father and mother issues, I feel very sorry for him, but he's a very strong character and keeps going :D

"cy4a0ln","Yes... Masturbation seems to be the only way to do things for me. Luckily, I have rather low sex drive, I can go for days without thinking about it so...

I started with DS2 first, then DS1, so I've gotta say that DS2 has got a large impact on me? The maps linkage is kinda wonky though... Other than that, I think it works just right for me. (Fun fact: During my first run through I was cautious as can be, killed every foe till they no longer respawn, take all the souls to level up... Then I lost 36k soul by dying twice... - This was before I know about Giant Lord + Bonfire Ascetic exploit. So, dumb me restarted after hours of grinding.)

I don't remember Artorias, actually, I didn't finish the first game... I kinda lost interest halfway through. Catarina Knight looks so freaking huggable.

I think lean bodies, be it male or female is good looking. But when the bulk comes in... I... Get a little... uncomfortable? Especially on females. Those who cheat have their 'reasons', but in an evolutionary perspective they are more 'successful' in spreading their genes. Although humans have evolved to care for our young in order to ensure that the new specimen can become of service to the community, so... sex hoppers would eventually be weeded out? I sure hope so.

The girls that I grow up around really do scare me quite a bit, more so than the guys. The guys merely disgusted me, the girls... they are quite the enigma to me. One of my 'goals' as a trans is to show that I be a model woman? Like... I don't know, be the independent, rational and modest type? I think females are brought up with the idea that they may try to succeed in life, but if all else fails, you can always get married..? I wouldn't wanna go down that rabbit hole, it could evoke sexism and I wanna stay as neutral as possible. After all, I dislike all humans.

Perhaps it just comes naturally to me, when online, I tend to give off that vibe too, my gender comes off as ambiguous, leaning toward the feminine side.

I've seen 'successful' transgenders on YouTube and some... not-so-successful ones on the streets. I hope those not-so-successful ones are still undergoing the change, cocoon stages are usually unpleasant.

I'm thinking of earning my own money before I take actions, sure, I do have savings with me now but... gotta keep them as reserves, who knows when I'd need them as emergency money. Gotta get my psychiatrist to give me the green light before I can proceed, but damn it, I'm hesitant as heck.

I did try to courteously break the illusions of religions in general whenever I'm in the presence of religious people. It doesn't seem to work... So I've watched/read up on why religious people are so stubborn with their POV, apparently, being subjected to religious doctrines as a kid has that effect on you. The truths told during those years become cemented and usually it's hard to break away from. Although a religious classmate of mine says that sometimes he doubt his own faith, feels bad about it, tries to be logical, but can't seem to put down faith... At least he's questioning. Then there's this other fellow I know, who is a half-believer, he goes to church, believes in afterlife but is pretty laid back and open to discussions.

I always imagined this scenario where ancient humans were camping in the caves one night, suddenly a storm brewed. One of the men went out to take a look at the rain, he turns around and raises his arms, just then, a bolt of lightning flashes through the skies. He shouted something, everyone else couldn't hear him over the voice of the roaring thunder, so they assumed that he just 'summoned' lightning. This supernatural coincidence made caught them in awe, this is when that man realized... 'I could use this to my advantage'. Tada, my hypothetical origin on how 'deities' come to be.

I always think that prayers are a lazy way to 'help' someone.

Josh Salatin as Chris Here at Movieclips, we love movies as much as you. November 10 / The Theater at Madison Square Garden / New York, NY Notes: For the ninth year in a row, Bruce Springsteen played the Stand Up For Heroes benefit in. Joke Directed At A Potential Sex Partner? Subscribe to TRAILERS:
(Sample: Tipton’s character, a breakup victim who’s been taking it hard on her sassy roomie’s couch, notes of her current existence, “I’m going backwards.I’m Benjamin Buttoning! ”) “You Live In BROOKLYN? Tipton’s Megan impulsively hooks up with Teller’s Alec; hostilities and misunderstandings ensue after the deed is done and she’s looking to make a getaway, but the getaway’s impossible because a blizzard has socked New York City and the now-resentful duo is snowed in. (Michael Showalter’s TV-screen bit part as a “wacky” weatherman is broad but not undiverting.) This is where the movie settles in and gets interesting, as the two discern an opportunity for complete honesty in the current situation.
When Daisy returns, she finds a note that Megan had scribbled, and she and Alec exchange the notes that they had found, and they break up. At a New Year s Eve party, Megan is arrested because the same note was found in Alec s neighbor s apartment, which the two had broken into earlier. Alec arrives to the prison with flowers and balloons. He pays bail, but Megan refuses to see him or even leave the holding cell. Later, when her roommate comes to pay bail, Alec apologizes, saying that he didn t know her last name and that this was the only way he thought he could see her again.
The characters are smart and funny, but the story digs much deeper.It reminded me of coming-of-age stories from my youth.” Nichols read the script, which appeared on the Blacklist in December, 2011, and pitched his vision of the story to producers Beau Flynn, Ruben Fleischer and Adam Yoelin. “I was shooting a Willie Nelson video in Austin, TX in May [2012] and got a call that I [was on board],” said Nichols. “We immediately started casting the film and were lucky to have a lot of talented actors and actresses who were interested, but there was something about Analeigh [Tipton s] ‘Megan’ that caught my attention.” Nichols said it was “essential” that her character’s ‘date’ Alec understand that “he’s never met a girl like her and can’t let her go.” Miles Teller joined the cast soon afterward as Alec and the rest of casting was completed in late summer.
When a blizzard traps them in Alec s apartment, they are forced to get to know each other beyond the confines of a one-night stand. Two Night Stand has its moments. But moments are all this movie has — and all its characters are likely to get. Two night Stand may turn into a permanent love affair if these two witty millennials have their way.well written this glimpse into the lives of this underserved rom com demographic makes the time.

My advice (which is really advices friends have given me): ENFPs are bright and funny. But be sure to be serious and vulnerable too. There's this side of us that's kind and has a sharp perspective, but when I was young I was too keen to play the clown all the time. Seeing people smile and laugh made me feel good. We have so much depth beyond that to share though. 

Lastly, connect with good people - this is difficult, because there are so many interesting people we would never think to form a friendship with. One of my close friends is 28. The girl I'm seeing is super shy in class - we would have never talked if not for a team project. The point is, don't miss out these great people and always have an open mind and heart.

- The train signage, for example, is totally something that could just be programmed into the existing electronic messageboards (probably).

- I'll research why CalTrain to Milbrae only runs a very limited schedule (potentially info [here](http://www.bayrailalliance.org/question/why-is-the-caltrain-connection-to-sfo-via-bart-so-cumbersome))

- SFO wifi would just be a case of one or two more routers in the customs hall.

- De-synching buses is something I can ask SamTrans about.

- Clipper card issues (registering a new card on mobile is near-impossible; they could/should have a big advert in the airport info kiosk) can be raised with them.

The argument was that there are two aspects to good comedy: jokes, and delivery.  You need both of these elements to be a truly funny comedian.

"csgyfou","That was an interesting and funny, but also a bit depressing read. Just the way I always feel after going to a lecture/presentation from a non-denominational church or even a prayer group.

I've got one funny story for you: A friend of mine, an atheist, went to a prayer group once, and he took another friend with him, who was a Roman Catholic. The people there welcomed them and asked them if they believed in God. My friend said, no, he didn't, but they were eager to assure him that was totally okay, and that maybe he'd enjoy the prayer group and find the way to Jesus yadayada. Then they turned to his friend, who told them he was Catholic. They looked a bit embarrassed, there was an awkward moment of silence, before they started with their songs or reading the bible or whatever.

So essentially they still had hope for the atheist, but the Catholic… Well, there wasn't much they could do for him, his soul was lost, he would go to hell. :-D

When they told me the story afterwards they found it hilarious, but they felt very weirded out about what came afterwards, which was similar to what you described, except that it took place in one of the guys' living room and not a church: Singing songs, shouting “Oh Jeeeesus”, getting real ecstatic, throwing their hands in the air.

"crynds9","I'm a little late, but I am a HUGE podcast fan and listen to them nonstop. I'm huge on story-telling and investigation (big reason why I frequent AskReddit). Here are some of my favorites:

- Unpopular Opinion (Adam Tod Brown). ATB is an okay columnist for Cracked.com and a comedian in LA, so there's nothing terrible special about this podcast on the surface. BUT he brings on a bunch of comedians from the LA area and they essentially explore some ""unpopular opinions"" on certain subjects. After several episodes, the engineer starts jumping in on the action and he's the perfect contrarian without trying to be. The kind of show that is super funny but also somewhat informative. 

- RadioLab, This American Life. The original shows that got me into podcasts for their original story-telling and reporting. Radiolab is more geared towards science but both explore a variety of topics. 

- Serial. But who doesn't love true crime reporting from This American Life producers? Also check out Undisclosed, the Serial Serial, Crime Writers on Serial. The podcasts about this podcasts are endless. 
Related: Criminal, a true-crime podcast with a story per episode, similar to Serial but without the commitment. 

- Theory of Everything with Benjamin Walker. This show (along with Wiretapped with Jonathan Goldstein) presents storytelling that blends the lines of fiction and non-fiction. Nice head scratchers and laughs presented in little episodes. 

- 99% Invisible. One of the more popular ITunes podcasts, it explores the way design influences society. WAY more interesting than I made it sound. 

- Fatman on Batman. Kevin Smith has a Batman podcast, and he's interviewed almost everyone from the Animated Series, comic writers and artists, and even gives the scoop on the Batman of Hollywood. The last season he's spent a lot of episodes doing commentary tracks for the 90s Batman films. It's fun if you love Batman like I do. 

- Mystery Show. New podcast from TAM producer/contributor Starlee Kein where she solves mysteries. It's fun and cute. 

- Hound Tall with Moshe Kasher. Comedian brings on an expert to discuss a topic and a few more comedians to lampoon that topic. It's weird and funny. 

I could write out my entire podcast library but these are my favorites. Also check out any of the NPR podcasts if you're a news fan (Wait Wait Don't Tell Me, Diane Rhem, On Point).

"crym6qu","This may sound silly, but I asked my IT guy at work to block me from certain websites on my work computer.  He had fun with it, as I was diverted to some funny but completely inapplicable sites when I would try to go to one of my old standbys. 

My rationale for this turns out to be the same as what you're feeling.  You have the knowledge to determine the downsides of your current behaviors and you even have the skillset and the ability to do the other things that you want--and feel the need--to do.  You aren't able to do the other things because you don't have the *mindset*, or what others have referred to as discipline.

Discipline is easy...when there are immediate negative consequences for your choices/behavior.  What are the immediate consequences of playing on the computer rather than going outside or reading a book?  Virtually none.  And so discipline around this can be almost impossible.

So then you get resourceful for work-arounds.  Someone mentioned unplugging your computer.  That makes it difficult for you to continue your current behaviors.  Find other ways to keep yourself accountable, even by talking with others to help keep you in the zone when your brain is telling you to get back on the computer.  

Set a timer when you get on-line.  The alarm goes off, you agreed to yourself that it's time to do something else.  

If you have the means, talk to a life coach.  I know, I know.  But they will help you to understand your own values and to pursue your goals through better self-understanding.  

These are just a few thoughts, but it's OK to create work-arounds.  Be resourceful, and good luck.",1433701736,"he had fun with it, as i was diverted to some funny but completely inapplicable sites when i would try to go to one of my old standbys.","funny but completely","funny","but",FALSE,"funny but completely inapplicable","inapplicable",NA,"completely",1

TJ Miller has a hilarious pod with Cash Levy, a man I had no idea even existed until I listened, and he's become one of my faves. The format is silly, with lots of riffing and kind of improvised bits in the way Bone Zone does it. This is also the pod with like the longest running in jokes and things like that. You will get more out of later episodes by being familiar with older ones, but they aren't required listening to enjoy it.


Pete Holmes podcast You Made it Weird is great too, but it's conversational more, but still very silly. I recommend Josh Ruben episode as a starter to this one. Though other episodes will be a lot more serious, but still 'silly'.


Houndtall by Moshe Kasher is a great new one where he has a panal of one expert, and 2 comedians and they discuss a subject in a live theater. Really fun one. Informational, but silly.


Bertcast with Bert Kreischer is another good one, often times VERY funny, always interesting. He's just a hilarious guy so any conversation he has is tinged with hilarity. 


Duncan Trussells podcast is fantastic, but might not be your style. It's often very funny, but he also often has serious guests. This is the guy that recorded a podcast with his mother hours before her death. Powerful stuff, has made me cry on multiple occasions. But still just so damn funny.


Here We Are by shame mauss is great, but more interesting subjects than just random conversations, but still very funny. Check out some descriptions of the episodes.


Ten Minute Podcast is always funny, and short and sweet. Never too much, given that you enjoy the hosts. 


Harmontown is also a great one, a weekly live podcast hosted by Dan Harmon, the creator of community and co creator of Rick and morty. He is always accompanied by a group of great hilarious people, and they usually play a bit of Shadow Run at the end of the episode, which is like d&amp;d but in the future, or something(it used to be d&amp;d, but they switched it up). It's nerdy, but always hilarious. The way the people deal with the situations in the game are extremely amusing. Dan also once had all the black people at the show come up on stage and play as one single character. It's beyond absurd sometimes.


That's Deep Bro is a great one, the tagline is something like, ""serious conversations with silly people"". Hosted by the very funny and insightful Christina patsizky, who is married to Tom Segura. Another kind of philosophically based one, but woven in with funny moments.


As for non comedy associated ones, 99% invisible is a great, very informative show, I recommend looking thru the ep listing and finding something that interests you as a good starter. Same with Memory Palace, very similar format and set up. Thinking Sideways is a good one where they explore unsolved, or unexplained mysteries and the like. Recent episodes were about the Mills Family, the Tylonal murders, and an episode about the wife of the current president of scientology, who has been missing or something for a few years I believe.

But I think, human in general can ""evolve"" to a stage where people don't need these shallowness to cover up for the big empty hole in our existence. It's what some cultures call being zen and achieving Nirvana and all that. It's the realization that we're mere creatures at the mercy of some bigger force, and be content with that realization, since it's not a negative trait per se. Our lives would become very nihilistic, yet in a sense, happier.

"cqalpa8","Well i think one of the first things is we need that Orthodox college to succeed which it has been growing. Why you ask??

We need it to succeed so that we can get funds, show that it does work. Also with it succeeding and being good it can give us political capital(basically helps with politics). It would also help with getting good professors in there which include orthodox and non-orthodox.

Another thing that might not be as clear is i Think more monasteries. Which might not be clear but with more monasteries we can attract more monks to America and maybe get some. It is something that i think is lacking in America anyways, but by having more it will help the faith grow anyway so its a win/win. Because Monks make great professors, and making monasteries for them will be great. 

So here are some basic ones too. Money, of course we need lots of money which the first can help with. It costs a lot to run/set up a University. One thing that can be helped without Money is Good books. you might not think it but a library can have a huge effect on being given certification. I helped out at a Orthodox academy that tried to get certified as a college for a long time and one of the things they always got dinged for was not having a big enough library. So having a good library matters a lot. 

You would need to line up professors next. getting teachers and also administration too. I think Administration might be easy enough to get as there would be a big call for. 

Land would also be pretty easy as there are a couple of orthodox millionaires that deal in land and probably would help buy it. 

Students- that might sound funny but most schools start out without being certified(see st. Katherine's), The students have to be willing to take risk that the school doesn't pass and then they will be stuck. 

staff- I think these would be easy to find if the rest gets into place plus probably be people willing to help out. 

Help-I think this might be easy to help but would help a lot to get help from other Orthodox universities. This might just be the guys trying to start a university going to orthodox universities to ask questions could include help from those that started st. Katherine. 

I do think it might really hard to start at this point as St. Katherine is hurting for money right now and trying to start another school would make it even harder for both schools. I wouldn't be surprised though if there is a movement to start one already. 

I know Met. Joseph right now is trying to get more monasteries in American(read any for antiochians). He is actually trying to get more orthodox camps too which would help too by letting more orthodox together which grows there faith which might make them more willing to go to an orthodox university. 

I am probably missing a lot more points but i think these are some of the big points.

I feel people often mistake the Thrill associated with shows like  True Detective and Breaking Bad with being a great TV show, which might be one of the ways but it's not the *only* way to be great. 

This often happens with shows like Looking, Transparent, Mad Men, Togetherness, Girls, Enlightened, Treme, Rectify, The Leftovers and OITNB. 

OITNB can definitely compete with the best HBO shows. It isn't dark and violent and thrilling in a  'manly' kind of way so it doesn't get the love other shows like GoT and BB get in Reddit, but it's definitely one of the very best shows on TV. It is filled with terrific actors in some of the most nuanced relationships in TV,  with backgrounds often ignored in media  whose stories you'll hear nowhere else on television. There might not be blood and terribly high stakes, sometimes it might be broad and funny, but it's terrific in its own way.

When I went through panic attacks and panic disorder and it was the worst thing I ever experienced. I thought my life was ruined and I was just going to miserable the rest of my life.

My life was like a nightmare. The panic attacks came at all times of the day and night, completely randomly.

I thought I had cancer. I thought I was developing schizophrenia. I thought I had brain tumors. I was sure I was having a heart attack. I couldn't eat or sleep. I lost 35 pounds because food would get stuck in my throat and I'd choke. I could sleep more than an hour at a time, and nights were endless misery. I was scared of everything and reading google news was unbearable. I had panic attacks triggered by things like my iPhone dinging at midnight, and once taking a deep breath and coughing, and another time because a character on the TV show ""The Veep"" had a sneezing fit. I can not express how horrible that time was. Most of my panic attacks came out of the blue though and kept me from having any ""safe place"" or peace of mind.

I read all sorts of things on the internet promising to ""Stop Panic Attacks Fast"" that didn't help and only made things worse. My life was completely without joy or peace.

Then I started reading less ""random internet site selling crap"" and more medical sources. It turned out that panic disorder and anxiety attacks have the highest cure rate of any mental disorder. I'm all better now. Panic disorder is curable and you can get your old life back. Really.
Along the way, I found an old but amazing book called ""Hope and Help for your Nerves"" by Dr Claire Weekes. I can't recommend it highly enough. That book is $6 on Amazon.com and there's a good chance your library has a copy too. Take a look at some of ""most helpful"" reviews. And look at the most helpful negative review too. That one is funny, because the guy wrote a negative review of the book but hadn't yet experience a ""real"" panic attack. He revised his review after he did.

""Hope And Help for Your Nerves"" literally CURED my crippling panic disorder. No kidding. I don't take any medicine. I don't worry about where my Valium bottle is, and I sleep through the night. I've gone on 6 hour long flights over open ocean by myself. I am cured and I owe it all to ""Hope and Help for your Nerves.""

Dr Weekes suffered from panic disorder herself and understanding and warmth radiates off the pages. You will swear that she wrote this book just for you. But at its simplest, you need to learn and believe that panic attacks can't really hurt you. Once you learn this, you are able to submit to the panic attack. You don't wish it away or try to stop it or try to distract yourself from it. You embrace it, you hold it close, you say ""Hi there adrenalin and fear. Make yourself comfortable, I'll be right here. Do close the door behind you when you leave.""

Once you learn to let panic attacks wash through and over you, and accept them and don't fight them, they lose their power over you. You stop dreading them. Your fear of them and sensations they cause keep them alive. They eventually go away. If they happen to recur, you are ready for them, don't feed the fire by fearing them or fighting them and continue to enjoy your life. It can give you your life back. The morning I got up after ""surviving"" three panic attacks and knowing I could float through them without harm and the first meal I was able to eat without choking and gagging will stay with me forever. And sleep. The morning I woke up after sleeping 5 straight hours was sheer heaven.

Because I was actually panicking, I couldn't think clearly. I could understand panic attacks just fine when I wasn't having one, but when I was, I would literally panic, and not be able to remember or convince myself that what I was feeling wasn't really harmful. Reading Dr Weekes books DURING panic attacks reminded me, grounded me, and got me cured. I began exercising every single day, I never took a day off. I started off just walking and listening to Terry Pratchett's ""Disk World"" series. It burned off energy and the Disk World series is funny and smart and nonviolent. I slowly, slowly ramped up the intensity until I started running regularly for the first time in my life.

But seriously, a brisk walk, like you're a couple of minutes late for the bus stop and your hurrying burns up lots of energy and adrenalin. Combine that with a fun, interesting book on tape like Harry Potter, Disk World, or Bryson's ""Short History of Everything"" and only allow yourself to listen while you exercise, and soon you'll be looking forward to your daily walks/jogs.

Don't despair if it doesn't work right away. Your adrenalin releasing system is wound up and on a hair trigger and you are constantly self-assessing to see if your anxiety is reduced and, of course, it isn't. I've been there and it's like poking the warm coals of your anxiety with a stick and reigniting the fire.

I quit my ridiculously enormous coffee addiction cold turkey. I don't think it helped, but I like not being addicted any more. I tried Klonipine and Prozac too, but I was terrified of getting addicted to Klonipine and the Prozac made me more anxious. I quit them both after about two weeks. I probably should have given them more time, but I just couldn't.

-exercise every day for at least 45 minutes in a way that lets you burn off energy.
-find some funny but engaging entertainment 
-avoid violent and mean entertainment 
-quit caffeine 
-read ""Hope and Help for Your Nerves"" and use her 4 point method 
-get better

People ask me if I still get panic attacks ever. No. Very, very occasionally at night as after I first lay down, my heart will start to race and pound and I'll think ""wow, I used to let his bloom into an hours long panic attack."" Now, the whole thing is over in about two to three minutes. No drama no fuss. No misery, and I roll over and sleep well.

Here's a tip for sleeping from when I was getting over my panic disorder. Progressive relaxation techniques and hypnosis apps like Andrew Johnson's excellent iPhone app (several are free!) are great when I was NOT having a panic attack and helped me be more relaxed in general. There's also a great app that's maybe $1-3 dollars (I forget) called ""Simply Being"" that's actually a guided meditation but always puts me to sleep. That one is a win/win, because if it puts me to sleep, great! If not, I get a great meditation out of it which is the next best thing to sleep. If you don't have an iPhone, you can them as MP3s too, but the app are nice because you can tailor them to your preferences. If you don't have an iphone or money is super tight, there are some excellent guided meditations available on youtube.

If you're actually in the middle a panic attack, don't bother with the hypnosis or mediation apps. It's like trying to put out a forest fire with a garden hose, and, at least for me, the ONLY thing that worked in the midst of a Panic attack was Dr Weekes techniques where you face the panic and accept it and wait for it to run its course. Because I was actually panicking, I could not think clearly and needed to physically read chapter 7 over and over again to remind myself what was happening to get through them. Panic disorder gets kept alive by us, including our own self talk. For example, when I was going through my panic disorder, the heart sensations and palpitations would come and I'd think ""This is horrible. Please stop."" Instead I'd make myself say ""That is my strong powerful healthy heart beating in my chest. It feels so good to feel my strong powerful healthy heart beating so strong and healthy."" That sounds like woowoo nonsense, but it really does help.

One thing that really helps with feeling of not being able to catch your breath and racing heart is belly breathing. Belly breathing involves leaving your ribcage out of breathing and uses your belly instead. When you take a breath, your belly pushes out and when you exhale, it come back in. Belly breathing does a couple of things. It removes the ""tight chest, I can't catch my breath"" from the panic attack. It is also how we breath when we are relaxed and sleeping, so it sends a signal back to our brains that ""everything's cool."" It helps so much. Also try 4,4,4 breathing. Breath in for a 4 count, hold for a 4 count, exhale for a four count. It will chill things out considerably.

"cmscxee","I'm not sure that I buy the argument that a minority of women displaying their breasts (or images of breasts) in a non-sexual context would increasingly sexualize breasts. To go off of your minority/majority point (adjusted for my own sexual interests), when I go to the regional burn in my area there are some men who go around naked but most men don't. The effect on me isn't to increasingly sexualize the exposed parts of the men in question, or of all men in general. Quite the opposite; it makes them and their display seem less sexual. Shirtcockers who go out of their way to accentuate their genitals similarly don't draw sexual attention to them (at least from me); instead they emphasize the mundane normalcy of their genitals in a culture that labels their exposure inappropriate, creating an effect that I find awesome and funny but not in the least bit sexy. Some of my friends who are attracted to women have expressed the same sentiment about the minority who go topless; it has the effect of naturalizing and de-sexualizing women's chests. 

Simply going from my own experience, I know that it is entirely possible for disruptive performances of gender norms, including this specific example of sexualized female nipples, to undermine them. We needn't think of this in all-or-none terms where we need every woman to jump on board to change gender norms everywhere; cultures don't exist as universal totalities. Where I live it's legal and not entirely uncommon for women to go topless, and I frequent several sub-cultures where it's quite normal. While changing a universal conception of gender norms via individual, disruptive performances can seem so daunting as to be impossible, challenging or changing local norms is an everyday occurrence.",1418345374,"shirtcockers who go out of their way to accentuate their genitals similarly don't draw sexual attention to them (at least from me); instead they emphasize the mundane normalcy of their genitals in a culture that labels their exposure inappropriate, creating an effect that i find awesome and funny but not in the least bit sexy.","awesome and funny","funny",NA,FALSE,"awesome and funny","awesome",NA,NA,0

"clm54vv","I have been on and off dating sites like OkCupid and POF for YEARS.  I have gotten some cuddle time, sexy time, and random dates.  I have made friends, enemies, etc.  For me at least, it seems like it goes in waves with how often I get responses.  I have read a ton of articles, done the critique thing on Reddit, and tried all kinds of different approaches.  In short, most things you read or hear are just BS.  The truth is, people are judgmental and picky as hell online.  The bullet points below are what I have HONESTLY taken from my experiences over the years...    
        
* Women are more critical/judgmental online than men are in real life.
* Every woman has different preferences and you can't make all of them happy.  What I mean by this is that some will prefer a ton of pictures, some want to see abs or a chiseled jaw, some want to read all about you, some could care less about you and want you to sound good on paper IE: good job, nice car, great career, some want you to be heartfelt, others want you to be an alpha male, some will want you to be hilarious, and most just want it all.
* Your opening message can't be too long, too short, too somber, too funny, or too crazy.
* Your best bet to get a response is to be funny, but there is a fine line between funny and crazy.  Each woman's funny/crazy line is in a different location.
* The number of women that will respond is directly determined by your geographical location.  Larger cities will garnish a larger response rate.
* Once you get a response your window of opportunity to capitalize on it is short so you must be quick to setup a date, but if you're too quick you will scare them off because you will seem needy or desperate.    
* Women over 28 ALMOST ALWAYS have some sort of MAJOR baggage; health problems, kids, psychological issues, etc.  Sorry ladies, but it's unfortunately the truth!  The hotter they are the more likely the problems they have will be severe. 
* That thing the dude does regarding the crazy/hot ratio line, with the Unicorn and TS', that's spot on!
* At the end of the day people connect because they feel there is a genuine interest, chemistry, and attraction with one another.  Your profile is just a shade of you, don't try to make it more than what it is.  It will never reflect you in full regardless of what you do.
    
In summary, women all seem to want someone/something different, except, they all want someone who will BE different than what they're expecting.  Someone who will sweep them off their feet, so to speak, without them expecting it, and in their preferred way.  I am sure this response will not help you figure out how to get more responses.  That said, I hope it helps you feel a bit more comfortable in your current predicament and realize that you're not doomed or alone in what you're going through, and you're not crazy for being frustrated or feeling exhausted from your online efforts.  Just remember, less is usually more.  Good luck amigo!

Some of these might be short ‘cause I watched a lot and was somewhat busy. 

**The Great Ecstasy of Woodcarver Steiner** Directed by Werner Herzog (1974)- Herzog’s short documentary about a few days at a ski-jumping competition has immediately become one of my favourites of his films. Over the course of a competition Herzog manages to capture the essence of a man while also making a film that feels like it’s about everything. Steiner’s normal life of carving wood is juxtaposed with his incredibly difficult hobby/love. He talks about the ecstasy of flight in one scene and as usual Herzog is just able to pull the most profound things out of people. Occasionally Herzog throws in slow motion footage of the ski-jumpers and it is mesmerizing. Something that I should be used to seeing at the Winter Olympics was made entrancing, spiritual in a way, and incredibly scary. At no point is the danger of this sport underestimated, most of the film concerns Steiner’s continued attempts at making the competition safer. He is so ridiculously good that if he jumped from where the judges wanted him to then he could quite easily die. The jump isn’t long enough to facilitate how good he can be and you really feel the gravity of that every time he approaches the slope. Steiner is by far the best in his field but he rarely seems that concerned with being the best. It is as if him being the best is just a fact so he can just enjoy the ski-jumping. He’s not a man who seems driven to be the greatest, he merely is. As said before, Herzog is brilliant at pulling profundity out of people and there is a perfect example towards the end of the film where he asks something that prompts the most tragic and beautiful story of a raven. Nothing feels like a Herzog film, and with the glorious Popol Vuh soundtrack this is more Herzog-y than most, and this is one of his greatest. The subject at the centre is fascinating and the way Herzog delivers it is spellbinding and thought provoking. 

**Batman: Gotham Knight** Directed by Yasuhiro Aoki, Yuichiro Hayashi, Futoshi Higashide, Toshiyuki Kubooka, Hiroshi Morioka, Nam Jong-Sik, and Shoujirou Nishimi (2008)- Anthology films are always mixed and a Batman one is no different. A bunch of different animation studios were given a very vague outline of a story to adhere to but could basically do what they want which offers several different ideas of what Batman is. How Batman can look, how he acts, how he affects others, and everything about him is approached from slightly different directions in each short and the thing as a whole seems to be trying to be a big deconstruction/summation of who Batman is. Some of the shorts are really strong while others are more just fun because of how they present Batman or whatever their particular animation style is. It is a nice tour of the Batman character and a bunch of different animation styles but not much else. It’s not even on the same level as a similar film, The Animatrix, as it doesn’t really add much to the character or his world. Enjoyable enough, even if some of the shorts drag, but not a highlight of the animated superhero films. 

**The Double Life of Veronique** Directed by Krzysztof Kielowski (1991)-  Mesmerising is the key word that describes my experience watching this film. As intriguing as the characters, mysterious plot, and thematic elements are, I found the pure experience of it to be the most impactful aspect. Irène Jacob’s wonderful performance and the fluidly beautiful images created a poem of a film. The story of two identical women born a country apart delves into the divide in Europe, free will, ineffable connections, and other hard-to-pin-down concepts. It is like Mulholland Drive through the lens of Malick but utterly its own thing. How we define ourselves and how others perceive us could be a very heavily intellectual debate or discussion but Kieslowski explores these ideas with subtle grace. Through the course of a compelling and mysterious tale all these themes swirl around, explored from an emotional stand-point more than an intellectual one. Not that the film couldn’t be examined and picked apart, it’s just that my response and the source of my thoughts on the film did not come from investigation just from the experience of it. I’ve liked what I have seen of the Colours Trilogy so far but this was even a step above them for me. As much love as this film already gets I’d love to see it discussed more ‘cause it’s got to be one of the best films of the 90’s.

**Goldfinger** Directed by Guy Hamilton (1964)- I love Bond, have for years, yet have only now seen what is often touted as the best Bond film. I can definitely see how that is the common consensus and after attempting to (then giving up on) watch Never Say Never Again the greatness of the film as a Bond film was highlighted even more. There’s Bond knocking suckers out, killing them in ingenious ways, throwing out one liners, sneaking around facilities, bedding gals, and facing off against supervillains; the film hits every Bond note perfectly. That is except in one moment where Bond rapes Pussy Galore. She does seem to relax after he has thrown her around and forced himself on her but still. What made it even worse was that it seemed hinted earlier in the film that she was a lesbian making the scene some sort of warped conquering. It’s so reflective of many distorted viewpoints like “no really means yes” and “she’s only a lesbian because she hasn’t met the right man” and all that, hard to look over but not something that completely sucked the enjoyment out of the film. Bond’s incessant banging does actually come into play in the film, early on he’s chastised for letting women interfere with his work, which was nice to see Bond reflect on himself a bit but not enough to not rape I guess. On the whole though it is some classic Bond action. Like a lot of the classic Bond films it looks great and the scale of it at times is sometimes huge. Not sure it beats You Only Live Twice for my top spot but Goldfinger is still an excellent Bond film even if it does reflect some backwards ideas. 

**The Sweet Hereafter** Directed by Atom Egoyan (1997)- The Sweet Hereafter is about the people of a town that loses most of its children. Different stories are shown to be intertwined as the film jumps around; it goes for the transcendental thing and nails it. One think I kept thinking throughout was how this draws attention even more-so to how empty Prisoners seemed. When this film commits to a subject matter it fully goes for it exploring the different types of child-related pain. Ian Holm stars as a lawyer who comes into this small town to try make a difference and some money while he’s at it. His performance is astounding, Holm disappears and becomes this tragic broken man. All of the performances are good throughout, but he really does stand out. Every performance feels honest and raw but his is particularly gripping. Slowly the feeling and little culture of this town is unveiled before its destruction happens in front of us. The whole film is a series of car crashes, moments where one can only watch knowing that something terrible is about to happen. Emotions run high, everything feels emotionally charged, and it gives the film a strange tension even though there isn’t always really direct tension. I liked the feel of the film too. For a while it is a series of visitations, made up predominantly of conversations, and each one feels like the film moving into a different side of sadness. At times it was a bit on the nose with its metaphors/allusions but for the most part I really loved this film. 

**Broadcast News** Directed by James L. Brooks (1987)- I hate going into comedies with the expectation that they’ll “just” be a comedy. I feel like most comedies today are usually just a “did you find this funny or not” affair in that the stars/comedians are the draw because filmmaking-wise there’s not much going on. Sure they’ll go through the usual story and emotional beats with a bit of a new twist but on the whole modern comedies are really formulaic. **Neighbours** which I watched this week kind of epitomizes this. It’s fine and quite funny but all it really does is evoke a few chuckles. Broadcast News is not this type of comedy. It is funny and has a great cast but it is also beautifully shot, has interesting and complex characters, and has ideas beyond the usual “everyone needs love” or whatever. First The Piano and now this, Holly Hunter is completely winning me over. She’s the main character in this, a woman who is kind of caught in a love triangle. She’s works at a news station and has her new handsome anchor and best male friend pining after her. That could be a recipe for such a trite work-place comedy but Broadcast News goes completely beyond that. Relationships are presented as they actually are in life. Attraction is a complex thing and the film tries to look at it from all angles. Little things can make someone loveable or completely detestable and something like a completely opposing ideology can disappear when attraction is there. William Hurt and Albert Brooks (who I need to see more of) play the two dudes and are both at times hilarious and touching. Both men deal with different insecurities and the conflict between them of “handsome idiot succeeds easily while smart normo has to struggle” is another thing that could feel so played out but it has nuance to it beyond “just comedies”. I also loved that Holly Hunter wasn’t just the typical hard-working-and-strong type character. She is really strong, and works really hard at her job, but she has a sincere vulnerability that these types of characters often lack. So often are comedies about relationships but rarely do they cover them as well as this. Even if I wasn’t laughing it would be a fantastic film, which I find is rarely the case with modern mainstream comedies.

"cie7r5n","Email.  In person, my boss is intelligent, capable and funny... but she has the *worst* email communication skills I have ever seen.  She sends everything from her iPhone and apparently punctuation is too difficult so she sends every phrase in a separate email, stream-of-consciousness style.  She doesn't include much clarification or direction, so it's difficult to figure out what she wants.  These emails might as well be haiku.  She usually doesn't return emails for hours, sometimes days, so I have to choose between plowing ahead with something that might be wrong or losing an entire day of work while I wait for her.  

Her email writing style is extremely curt and it comes off as rude, angry or dismissive (even when she's not).  She's *capable* of sitting down at a computer and composing a decent email when she's contacting a client, but when she emails employees it feels like she's giving commands to a dog.  I'm not the only employee who feels this way.

Since most of the employees (including me) work off-site and she ""doesn't have time"" for phone calls or online meetings, email communication is extremely important.  I've only been working there for a few months and I already know people who have quit over problems with email.  I was unemployed before and the job is otherwise *perfect*, so I don't want to be the next person to leave.   The stress is killing me, though.  I lose sleep and have panic attacks over these awful emails.  I feel like there's no way to approach her about the issue... apparently other people have tried, and she says they're just being ""defensive"" or ""incompetent.""

He basicalky gives a big fuck off to all his fans completely disrespecting them. Then drives off in his car to a yacht in Monaco on money he wouldnt have without fans. Then all the fans love him for it. I dont want short bs answers I want some fucking depth.

Bernie is good for the sport. He loves F1 and wants it to be better but has to bend to get what he wants. Better the devil you know than the devil you dont. Otherwise we would get some prick and end up with like 2 European races.

Kamui is entertaining but just an average driver. I do like him though he has a good set of balls on him.

Hamilton has no balls and he is a little bitch. He acts like a rich kid at school who thinks he is cool and funny but nobody likes him.

Massa is crap. Seems like a pretty popular opinion though.

I hate Lotus's pr attempts they are lame. I think its good pr in the sense they get a lot of publicity. But what they come up with isnt funny or witty.

I dont care if someone is a pay driver. Unless they are truly slow like Chilton. Mal is fine at least he can be quick F1 needs the money to continue.

Prost was better than Senna. He was smooth and looked like he was going for a sunday drive. Senna fought his car and just had massive balls. There is more to f1 than just speed.

**Wake Up Girls**

This was one of my surprises for the season. I'm not one of those who think that Yamakan is a talentless hack, but I wasn't expecting him to redeem himself on an idol anime, of all things. He says he hates moe, but ironically I think that's what he's best at. Oh poor cursed Yamakan!

This isn't to say the show didn't have it's weaknesses. The fundamental premise seemed to be about making a more realistic idol show, but this seemed quite frequently forgotten for the sake of an easy resolution to problems or even just a comedy moment. The comedy was pretty mediocre, and whatever value it had in lightening the mood was lost by the fact that it made the show seem schizophrenic and even a bit stupid. The only time this show realized its true potential was in the first episode (the movie version). It was a bunch of normal girls joining a dysfunctional agency on the verge of bankruptcy for a chance at maybe getting a glimpse of their dream, and it was pretty grim and sobering. This was followed by another episode about them being exploited at seedy venues just because they were that desperate, and it seemed like the show was going to be amazing, but then the problem got resolved in a tidy and comedic way, and the show lost any pretense of wading more than ankle deep into the subject. 

As the show carried on, it became more about the girls and less about the business, and I have to say that the character depth *far* surpassed any other idol shows I've seen. I inevitably find these type of idol shows super addicting. I don't really like idol groups too much; the whole ""cute"" factor seems to pervade both the music and the choreography to the point where everything seems glossy and fake, but there's something in the shows that I can relate to. I guess really that anyone who's been on a stage can relate to. And that's probably why I get more excited at that moment right before they start performing than in the best shounen action sequences. 

**Inari, Konokon, Koi Iroha**

This show is another one of the surprise gems of the winter anime season, a diamond in the rough that most of you guys didn't notice. It's just a simple show about the trials and tribulations of a schoolgirl, combined with a dose of magic. The only thing that makes this show great is how utterly devoid of bullshit it is, and how utterly filled with life it is instead. Sure, our protagonist is given magical powers, but she quickly finds out that they are worse than useless if she can't muster up the courage it'd take to achieve her goals without magic even helping her. It's a sweet romantic drama, with no otaku stereotypes, very limited fanservice, and only authentic character interactions. Sadly, this also means that it's probably going to be a commercial failure.

**Nourin**

More proof that the better shows flew under the radar, IMO. Silver Link productions always get the short end of the stick, so I'm not surprised this was less popular than most of the lower-ranked shows on my list. And just like the shows ranked above this one, it also goes for the ""no bullshit"" angle quite frequently. 

One moment in this show really impressed me: the showdown between a student and his father, where the student was preaching all these organic principles, yet he lost the showdown because his food couldn't sell as well. It was a bit of a surprise because the show had seemed pro-organic up until this point, and indeed, most comparisons between foods favored the organic product. Yet at the end of the day, the customers preferred the father's ""scientific"" product that had been treated with fertilizers, sprayed with insecticides, and whatnot. 

I also liked the love triangle. This is coming from a love triangle hater. I liked this one because one of the girls was very clearly less attractive than the other one, forcing her to overcompensate and thus giving the love triangle a much more unique dynamic than most. The ending of this show surprisingly brought back memories of Macross, [where our protagonist wasn't just choosing between two girls, he was really choosing between two ways of life](/spoiler). The last scene was my favorite though, ""a bird can't fly with one wing"" indeed, you perv!  If only I could come up with such memorable sayings to justify my selfishness!

**Engaged to the Unidentified**

Is it just me, or are of my favorite shows the ones that nobody was really talking about? [According to this /r/anime survey](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/20uwqi/ranime_winter_2014_what_are_you_watching_top/), none of my top 3 choices were in the top 10 most watched shows this season. Well, we can add this show to the list of personal top choices that didn't make the top 10. This show was a superbly well-balanced romantic comedy executed with full confidence and none of the typical traps. ~~As a huge SHAFT fan, I have to say that this puts Nisekoi to shame.~~ Originality can't beat quality after all!

Of all the shows, I think this is the one I most want a second season of. 

**Kill La Kill**

So, it was basically another version of the ""make it as super and crazy as possible"" game. I don't know why they're still playing, TTGL won pretty conclusively at that game several years ago! Honestly, I was never a fan of this animation style (my apologies to all the Hiroyuki fans out there), and I feel like this is the anime that pretty conclusively shows the limitations of the style. Once you stretch things too far, they lose meaning, right? You don't even question the fact that they're yelling at each other in outer space, because it's been established that anything goes. But where goes the suspense? Kill someone, and you have no way of knowing if they really died or not, because normal indicators of death are meaningless in this style. This was Miyazaki's nightmare when he warned about ""excessive expressionism"" in anime. 

Oh, and the fanservice? No, fuck you guys, I'll be the person that complains about something *else*, thank you very much! Even if Trigger seemed a bit reluctant, they did make an earnest gesture towards including provocative shots of naked male bodies, and they did have a real point behind all that, even if it wasn't a very great point and served just as much as an excuse for perverted animators to have their fun. I honestly find that we're way too damn critical of sexuality anyways, but I've already had that rant and I'll save the rehash for another day. 

**Sekai Seifuku**

When the series turned dark, I just had one thought: ""please, don't let this show cop out with silly nonsense!"" Not that I mind catharsis, mind you, but even that can be overdone, turning too many anime finales into a whiplash from dungeons to rainbows. Unfortunately, that's basically what happened. Rather than something with actual meaning, we got the usual ""laugh and be happy"" combined with some half-assed attempts at philosophical messages. 

This show was *okay*. I can see why people were excited over it, but in the end the series felt like little more than a wisecrack. The intro was never justified (perhaps signaling an intent for a season 2? Well, they'd better deliver now!), and none of the characters or themes were really fleshed out. It was funny, but ultimately shallow.

**The Pilot's Love Song**

The amusing forum reactions to the destruction of Isla really revealed a big flaw in the show; it doesn't put nearly enough effort into explaining shit. According to people who've read the novels, [Isla began picking up speed as it approached the end of the sky, eventually reaching the point where it was uncontrollable and everyone had to bail out](/spoiler). Wow, isn't that kind of… a really crucial plot point? I did like the ending though, quickly snuffing out a potential love triangle instead of making the usual drama out of it (I even found Ari to be more attractive and interesting than Claire, but I'd rather leave her with a bittersweet farewell than go through tons of cliche drama just for a happy ending), and I actually felt like this was a perfectly fine open ending (IMO that sense of ""new beginning"" is crucial to a good open ending)

I'd say that overall this show was somewhat inconsistent, with both clear hits and misses. Death flags were way too obvious, the battle scenes were sadly unrealistic, that whole ""little brother"" ""little sister"" thing was totally stupid and annoying, yet still the whole affair had a bit of earnest charm that I couldn't ignore.

"cftc07h","A few people have touched on this, but there's (to me), a few pretty simple reasons why.

First, the historical aspect.  For a long time, comedy was a man's game, especially any form of stand-up.  Men were the only performers, and they were hired by men and approved of by men.  With the rare exception, there were no popular female comedians.  So, when the really successful woman comedians first started getting popular, such as Phyllis Diller or Joan Rivers, they got popular for 2 reasons:

1) They weren't conventionally attractive.
2) They made jokes that were acceptable to a male audience, but not threatening.

Let me explain that a little more.  As someone else mentioned, even today there's still an expectation that women should shut up and look pretty.  While it's nowhere near the kind of oppression that used to exist, it is still a factor.  Conversely, men rarely experience such expectations.  They are encouraged to use humor, make jokes, be bombastic or in your face or ""alpha,"" however you want to call it.  Men are expected to be the aggressor, to be proactive.  When a lifetime of that suggestion is staring men and women in the face, it shows.  Male comedians have had their entire life to develop timing and humor, whereas female comedians probably had a host of factors telling them that what they were doing wasn't acceptable.  On stage, the difference between bombing and killing is often simply timing and inflection, not the actual material.  Pair that with the years of development that the comic does or does not have.  As men have naturally been given that option, and women have had to work harder for it, it translates into more men seeming funnier.

Comedy is, by its nature, often aggressive.  It's a person standing in front of many people, demanding to be the only person in the room talking and spouting forth opinions.  Seeing a woman do that was distasteful to many men back in the day, because it ran contrary to this idea that women were supposed to be demure and acquiescent.  Since the majority of comedy signers and club owners were men, funny women often got shot down unless they were the cream of the crop, whereas many male comics could be less funny, but didn't have that inherent prejudice dragging them down.

So where do female comics like the ones I mentioned above come in?  They played off stereotypes, much like the old minstrel shows, which was palatable to (back then) a largely white and male consumer demographic.  They had funny moments, but they were ""safe.""  They didn't threaten the status quo of male comics because they carved out a small niche.  For example, why did so many female comics succeed with jokes about being a housewife?  Because that was an occupation that men liked women to be in.  Even if the comic was making jokes about wanting to divorce her husband or talking about bodily functions, it was all couched in ways that were acceptable to a male demographic.  You can still see this today in any niche comedian.  Take George Lopez, for example.  Probably 95% of his material is about being Mexican.  Most of his audience is Latino.  Some white people like George Lopez because they can think, ""Look at that ethnic group and the silly things they do.""  For women, they have to portray women's issues in a way that makes men think the same way.  The moment it becomes confrontational or empowering, male audiences reject the comedian.  It's why you have comics who are defined by their audiences, because white audiences won't go to them.

As for the attractive comment, accepting funny material from an attractive woman would be a threat, because being attractive and funny would sway the power dynamic, and male audiences didn't want that.  Though many probably didn't actively think it was a problem, subconsciously, being attractive and funny meant that women could be on an equal footing with men, and that was unacceptable.  Even today, there are still elements of that mentality.

The other big thing I haven't mentioned is simply sense of humor.  Women make jokes that relate to women, and men make jokes that relate to men.  Not always of course, and there is often a crossover, but the gap is there because people speak of what they know.  Combine that with the fact that male audiences often go into a comedy club expecting the female comics to suck, and many of them end up resorting to pandering, going for easy material, like marriage and periods and boobs.  Male comics don't have that pressure, and as a result, are expected to talk about a wider variety of topics that aren't pigeonholed.  So, male comics are seen as more dynamic, diverse and talented, even if the female comics are making the same jokes.

So, to reiterate: Males are given more latitude in life to develop a sense of humor and don't have to worry about an inherent prejudice, which gives them a wider amount of topics to choose from.  I'm sure there's a slew of other sociological factors at play here, but I've tried to narrow down what I think are the biggest.",1393868317,"as for the attractive comment, accepting funny material from an attractive woman would be a threat, because being attractive and funny would sway the power dynamic, and male audiences didn't want that.","attractive and funny","funny",NA,FALSE,"attractive and funny","attractive",NA,NA,0

"cft9lcw","Based on my many games in casual Conquest you have the following roles before the match starts:

Role #1: The **Insta-locker** Person who picks a god like Sun Wuking, that can jungle, support, or solo. This person never communicates which role they want to play, then randomly wanders around the map. Very common in EST morning times.


Role #2 **Know-It-All** Person calls a role, and selects the Uber-God-du-Jour. Then they tell other people what to pick for the roles they called. If you pick differently then their recommendations, then you're ""Noobs, and should uninstall and go back to LOL""


Role #3 **META-Breaker** These are they people who want to play Ra in the Jungle, Thanatos as a tank, Ares mid, Chang'e Jungle, or Merc as an ADC. When someone questions their selection the reply is always centered around how they are in the Diamond league, and they do this all the time. They are not in Diamond, and they always fail.


Role #4 The **Grinder** Selects a god before calling the role, then trying to make the god selection fit whatever they can. They don't insta-lock, but they refuse to change because they are ""one win away from mastering."" This is my personal hell for the first two weeks after a new god is released.


Role #5 The **AFK asshat** Starting to be come more common in Bronze league, this person clicks accept for match selection then is either abducted by aliens, or is distracted by a nearby shiny object. They forget that they are playing a game and wander off, never to be heard from again.


Then there are the In-Game roles:

Role #1 **The General** There is a reason Generals no longer lead from the front lines. They are so focused on the big picture they cannot direct troops or fight at the tactical level. This asshat is so busy telling you how to play your role that they cannot play theirs. Inevitably, when they begin to lose their lane, it is obviously everyone else's fault because they are not following orders.

A lot of chance encounters with the other jungler, a Thor IIRC, ended with me the victor. In short order i was dominating the match. (not bragging here, I'm a solid player, not some God playing Gods.) I was like 10/0/2 and trying to ignore this guy. Normally, I would have muted him, but he was very good at communicating when mid left his lane and he'd shoot me a ping when he saw Thor cross his lane or try for a Mid XP camp. I went to steal their Speed, and ran into four of the other team. I died. So this asshole starts laying into me for being 11/1/2 - I killed one of them with my poison - and I couldn't take it. I shouldn't have, but I began BM this clown right back. I KS'd every kill by pulling them out of his Ult with mine. It was quite funny, but very sad at the same time.


Role #3 The **MMO player** They almost always play Jungle, but occasionally someone in Solo or the ADC does this. They just want to level. They never leave the jungle to gank, or leave the lane. It is all about the EXP. To these guys, the game doesn't start until level 20, when they can go raiding. 


Role #4 The **Build Master** They have every build used by the top players memorized and heaven help you if you buy any non-approved item. They usually revert to being a Bad Mouther when you don't follow their perceived builds exactly. I forgot about these nitwits until I was recently experimenting with not buying boots on Sun Wuking in solo lane when facing  predominately physical teams, and a physical solo on the other side. Witchstone has a 15% movement rate. Tabi have 18%. Sun Wuking has no problems with mobility. Anyways I finished 8/5/16 or so, but I had to mute the **Build Master**.


Role #5  **The Camper** This player has a Viagra fueled hard-on for the Gold Fury, the Fire Giant, or both. As soon as he hits level 12 he begins spamming VAF or VAG endlessly. The second they spawn, his is mashing that macro key every 2 seconds. You could have all the enemies towers down, the phoenixes dead, just scored a Diecide, and the ~~Minotaur~~ Titan at half health. If his binky camp spawns, though, he expects everyone to rush over there to kill it, instead of finishing the match. I've seen these chuckleheads leave the enemies room, when ONE more hit could have ended the damn game.

Phreak is hilarious, and knowledgeable, feels like he can both be colour and play-by-play caster. He makes any other caster better too, he is such a positive energy, bringing out the best in them.

Riv is even more funny than Phreak, his timing is just perfect, and he say the best one liners. And Riv also gives lots of room for his co-caster to come in and explain all sorts of things. What I noticed this week that was that Riv actually knows quite a bit, before that have been his weak-spot his lack of knowledge and when he confuses himself and trip himself up.

"cfatign","My best friend from high school has schizophrenia, so this isn't first-hand experience, but I obviously was there the whole time that she was slipping.

In 8th grade, we were on a field trip, and had to walk from one park (where we did a bunch of science experiments) to another park (where we did fun stuff and had a picnic).  Sarah\* told me an elaborate story of traveling to Cuba illegally via France with a few of our teachers.  She'd often go on long tangents of ""what if"" sorts of stories in such a manner that you'd think that she believed they'd actually happened.  She also had a terrible time concentrating in school.   She shouldn't have passed 8th grade based on how much school she missed and how bad her grades were, but she was passed on to high school.

By 10th grade, she had a voice in her head that no one believed her on.  Charles\* was a flamboyant, promiscuous gay man inside of her head.  Everyone thought that this was cute and funny, but in reality, she was fighting for control of her mind with Charles.  By the end of 11th grade, two more voices emerged in her mind- one a timid, bottle-up-the-emotions girl named Kara\* and a very angry man named Casey\*.  When they weren't actively whispering into her mind/ears, she referred to it as them being in their ""board meeting"", on how they were going to influence her actions next.

I know that she has looked back quite a bit on her childhood and looked at the exceptionally elaborate fantasy worlds that she created, and wondered if pro-dromal schizophrenia was to blame.  I didn't meet her until 6th grade, when we were 11 and 12.  She was absolutely obsessed with Rob Zombie and would lose herself in the universes that he'd create within his movies and music.  Losing oneself within an obsession or addiction can be a sign of hiding from how one's brain is actually functioning, too.  She also had a very hard time processing her emotions and understanding why/how others felt the way that they felt.

The last straw was covering the windows in foil so that she wouldn't feel like she was being watched.  Her parents finally admitted soemthing was wrong and got her into a doctor.  Her personality has changed drastically with the medication she is on- she has near 0 symptoms, but she and I are no longer friends.  I have texted her maybe 4 times since her birthday in June, and she has been very short with me since.  I'm not sure what happened, exactly, but I know she went on new medication in June, just before her 22nd birthday.

"ccoomxn","Just to be clear, I'm not affiliated with New Movement Theater, and I'm not the best source on it (wasn't trained there and don't live in either city). 

I have seen shows at both New Movement Austin and New Orleans, and they were solid long-form sets. I've watched Chris and Tami do a great duoprov show and run workshops (well done). I've also performed with Chris twice--once in Austin (in an instructor show when I was running a workshop at one of their festivals) and once when he was traveling through Baltimore. 

Style-wise, the shows aren't radically different than I've seen in other large long-form scenes. If you want to generalize wildly, lets say closer to UCB then iO, and closer to iO than Impro/Johnstone. The shows I saw tended to show a strong emphasis on pattern in scenes (kind of reminded me of the pattern-strong work that Patrick Gantz does in Richmond). 

I've seen Chris and Tami do some really smart and emotionally grounded improv. At the same time, they definitely have a ""balls to the wall"" sense of crazy fun to them (ok, so maybe a bit of Annoyance, if I'm going to go comparison crazy). Chris, for example, also dreamt up and ran the National Air Sex Championships [BEHOLD](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7perrB_-vg). 

As for the ""people say you can't teach funny, but I think we've proven you can,"" I can see that quote possibly echoing a view that many improv theaters have: funny isn't some ""talent"" that some people have and others don't; improv is something that everyone can learn and discover funny and wonderful things with.

"cbzhxh3","Chances are you're not doing anything wrong.  I suggest taking a close look at your friends.

Typically, how things play out at your age, is someone will express an interest about a person to that person's friend, either to collect information on that person or to inspire the friend to tell the person that they are liked.  What your friend should be doing is telling other people that you're this awesome guy, and would be a great boyfriend.  Unfortunately, that's not what everyone does.

What some people do is the opposite.  They discourage females from liking you.  This really isn't anything personal, they do this to everyone.  It has to do with greed.  The person sabotages your chance, because they want every girl to either like them, or no one.

The reason why I know about this, is because I was a victim of this for two-years.  I became friends with this guy, we started hanging out all the time, and next thing I know there's no woman that wants anything to do with me.  I couldn't figure out what was wrong to save my life, so I assumed exactly what you're assuming; there must be something wrong with me.

It sounds like you hang out with a fairly large group, so it's going to be hard to figure out which one is doing this to you (it could be a couple of them).  Honestly, chances are you'll never figure it out unless you just happen to overhear the conversation.

You've got your work cut-out for you.  Being that you can't rely on your friends to promote you, you're going to have to take the initiative and find your own girlfriend that's outside of your social circle (so they can't influence her decision).

Next time you go out with your friends, to a party or whatever, while you're enjoying the company of your friends keep an eye out for a girl that's not involved in your social circle at all (ideally someone who goes to a different school).  Just start talking to her.  She's probably be happy to meet you, and after a while she'll probably happily exchange phone numbers with you.

If I am right that someone close to you is sabotaging your chances, then this will also be a great way to test this.  This person will notice that you're hitting it off with this new girl, and they will feel compelled to ruin it.  How they will do it, is they will try to first pull you away from her.  Someone will call you into another room for something important (""Dude, we need you in here now""), and when you get in there you'll find it's nothing important at all (""Check out my new shoes, man!"").  Then, by the time you get back to the girl, her attitude toward you is completely different.  Where she was attentive and enjoying your company, you now feel like you're bothering her.  In that short period of time you were away, something happened to cause her to lose all interest in you.

Someone went up to her and told her that you're not a good guy.

This actually happened to me a couple of times.  The first time it happened to me, I was about your age and I was going through the exact same thing as you; I couldn't figure out why no girl wanted anything to do with me.  I eventually figured out it was my best friend's sister who had a crush on me and I turned her down.  She then dedicated the rest of our childhood in making sure I didn't have anyone in my life.  Because we all lived in the same neighborhood and she was rather popular with all the girls, there wasn't a single girl near me that wanted anything to do with me.  Oh, sure, they all thought I was cute, nice, and funny, but for some reason they all thought I'd somehow be a terrible boyfriend, regardless of being cute, nice, and funny.

"cb975vi","What really bugs me about the selective reddit comedy circlejerk is that no credit is ever given to the Opie and Anthony Show. They had Louie on for years- way before he got his first special or series. They found out about him from other New York comics, and cultivated an eclectic guest list of hilarious talent.

These were the guys who had Patrice O Neal on at least once a month. The only reason we're lucky enough to have over a hundred hours of Patrice's comedy is because of the show. Bill Burr has also been a regular since Norton joined but like Louie is now too busy to visit all the time.

These guys gave us hundreds of hours of comedy with three great comedians; lost one to disease and the others to the business- and where is the credit? And they're still doing it! They still have on the occasional c-list comedian on who is actually conversationally funny. Not podcast-y canned snarky circlejerk funny, but real brutal NYC comedy scene funny.

I've posted about this before and others have pointed out that reddit is innately hypocritical. Everyone champions free speech and pats themselves on the back for 'fighting SRS', but when it comes to taste itself? Nope, only safe comedy like the daily show is acceptable. Reddit -as far as I can tell- has regularly rejected O&amp;A for a few reasons:

1. [Right wing] O&amp;A is politically fairly right-leaning. I'm solidly left, but I still enjoy the jokes. Redditors don't want to admit that the right can be funny. That's somehow giving them credit, or letting them win.
2. [Brutal comedy for the sake of comedy] Reddit needs a safe ""out"" with most comedy. The comedy has to be pandering milquetoast, snarky smarter-than-you self absorbed bits, or an approved comedian who can 'get away with it.'
3. [Honesty about race and controversy] Redditors think they're so edgy and sincere when they devolve into a racist circlejerk. Now the opening volley is fine- the first guy to say he hates black people is at least getting the conversation going. But the difference is that on reddit there is no opposing voice like Patrice to even things out. When it comes to race reddit has a very British condescending attitude. I mean that it isn't ""don't say nigger"" it's ""Oh don't say that dear, you'll remind them that they're niggers.""",1374666429,"not podcast-y canned snarky circlejerk funny, but real brutal nyc comedy scene funny.","funny, but real","funny","but",TRUE,"funny , but real","real",NA,NA,1

"caucwdb","The following were events that ""allegedly"" happened, but remain unproven. And are funny as fuck. 

Someone resembling myself, was in a fraternity in college. Pranking was par for the course. However, it should be said, we were quite good at pranking. Usually it wasn't malicious; more so simply creative and funny. But this one time, a rival fraternity took it a little to far with us, so we were forced to whip out a trump card prank, (allegedly)....this is what what went down.

We had security cameras outside of our fraternity house. Right after school let out around the beginning of June, a rival fraternity stole our letters. And they took a shit in the drivers seat of my personal vehicle. There would be hell to pay. 

We threw a party that weekend and padlocked out bathroom doors shut. All peeing and shitting via all patrons, was to be done into plastic five gallon buckets in plywood ""stalls"" we built on several porches of our triple decker. We capped 16 buckets of fucking awful, &amp; let these ferment for like a week and a half in unrelenting 90 degree heat. 

One of our brother's fathers owns a pyrotechnics company that sets off 90% of the fireworks in the Northeast U.S.....so we got some of his equipment, some detonation wires, a detonator, and 16 quarter sticks of dynamite.

That Sunday night, 4 in the morning, we take 2 rented, nondescript vans and take the seats out from them, load 16 buckets of fermented shit &amp; piss into them with 10 of my fraternity brothers. Each of these buckets is capped, with a hole drilled in the top. Inside each bucket is a quarter stick, wired up to some det wire, wired up to a panel detonator (one where you just hit a single switch and it will set off multiple charges simultaneously). 

We rolled up to their house just prior to the asscrack of dawn, cardboard over the licence plates, ski masks,  all black gear, and unloaded the buckets onto their lawn and had one brother go try and pick the lock. The douche bags LEFT THE DOOR OPEN. So everyone took one or two buckets a piece and ran into the house, and put at least one in every room on the ground floor. After this was done (which took all of 10 seconds, as we had lined up the buckets in the order they were wired on the lawn prior to making our entry and just kind of circled them around the ground floor.....) We went outside and emptied the gas out of an airhorn. The lights go on. We wait five seconds or so, till we hear the first, ""What the fuck...""

BANG! Every window on the ground floor of the house blows out. And everything is coated in a fine mist of fermented fecal matter, piss and wet nasty TP. We see a lone brother of theirs, stagger out the door, and fall to his knees screaming, ""I can't hear, what happened....FUCK!"" Covered head to toe in shitspray so dank he had changed races. We peeled out laughing our asses off. Shit in my car? Fuck all y'all. Not. Even. Sorry.

"ca1a4we","After this I'm fully convinced Kuroneko is the best. There had been some doubt for me at the end of the first season, still liked Saori a lot (although I knew that would never happen) but at this point there's no question left in my mind.  Coming to that realization early made the rest of the episode extra great.

First thing I noticed watching through this episode is just how much Kyosuke has changed. His thoughts see to be heavily influenced by all the eroge playing at this point. It's leading to some fun lines and moments. 

I loved the clubs reaction to him telling them he just started going out with Kuroneko the other day. It really has seemed like he has been for a while. They're just so good together. 

Kuroneko's reaction to hearing about Kyosuke taking about when it's ok to touch her boobs was a great mix of funny and cute, just what I've come to expect from this show. Her initial reaction was pretty funny, but the scene it lead to after that with her talking about feeling the same way and about being so excited she made the entries in the notebook was amazingly cute. The thought ""they might be the cutest couple ever"" passed through my head even though I know that's an exaggeration. That whole scene where they were talking after the other members left the club room had a great and very real feeling to it. It brought back the feeling of ""ok, I have a girlfriend... now what?"" really well. The way that technically things have changed, but at the same time nothing is really different yet.  I can't wait to see more of the interaction between them. The next episode looks to be them going on a date and should be really cute and fun just like this week.

I haven't read up to this point in the books (I decided the anime is doing stuff so well I'd rather be surprised by how it goes than read ahead and already know). That still leaves me with the concern I had at the end of last week though. It seems too early in the season for a nice resolution. That makes it seem like something bad has to happen between them and might split them up or at least try. Hopefully it's only a try because I really want to see them stay together. Only on episode 7 of what, 15 or so they are planning?

Oh well, here's hoping for the best.",1368900815,"kuroneko's reaction to hearing about kyosuke taking about when it's ok to touch her boobs was a great mix of funny and cute, just what i've come to expect from this show.","funny and cute","funny",NA,FALSE,"funny and cute","cute",NA,NA,1

"c8koqy6","Islam solved all of these issues long before women sacrificed becoming a mother and taking care of her home and children for the sake of chasing an unnecessary career, leaving her children in daycare if she ever has any, and waiting until she is so old to start caring more about her family than her selfish financial goals that her children reject her and drop her in a ""retirement"" home as soon as they possibly can.

Feminism is an arrogant, egocentric, systemic sabotaging of the home and of the natural relationship between a man and woman. Without the mother loving her role, the home falls apart and the children are neglected. Saying that it's justified because men mistreated women in the last 50 years is like saying that black gang violence is justified because black people were enslaved 50 years go.

Islam rejects feminism. Islam sets roles for each gender. There is no equality. Women have more rights than men in some situations, and men have more rights than women in other situations. The Qur'an clearly says ""And men have one degree (of authority) over women."" This blatantly goes against everything feminism calls for.

And if it contradicts Islam, we must reject it, no matter how much we were taught to love it.

"c7a6v9z","**The Imposter** Directed by Bart Layton (2012)-  This is a documentary about a missing boy who reappears 4 years later halfway across the globe and what happens when he his found. There are many twists and turns along the way until the film becomes something completely different. Layton tells events through recreations, interviews and clever editing. For what could be a pretty depressing film Layton injects a lightness and humour into some of the recreations. Overall, it's an excellent and endlessly entertaining film that needs to be seen. 

**Writstcutters: A Love Story** Directed by Goran Dukic (2006) - In the past few years this films popularity has grown and it's become a pretty prominent cult film so I though I should check it out. It's a road trip comedy set in an afterlife for those who have committed suicide. It's generally pretty funny and has a few great supporting performances but it often dips into the low budget indie well of quirkiness. With some characters their quirks seem appropriate and add to their character but with others it seems to be quirky for the sake of quirk which is distracting and kind of annoying. This isn't too much of a problem as the first two thirds are heartfelt and funny but it has a very cliched end. The end is basically the same as Defending Your Life's end which I think I preferred. It's worth seeing for Tom Waits alone and for the most part it's really good.

**Solaris** Directed by Andrei Tarkovsky (1972) -  This was my first time watching Tarkovsky's sci-fi classic and I really enjoyed it. It's about three men and the psychological impact that a supernatural/hallucinogenic experience has on them whilst orbiting the titular planet. It's often compared to Kubrick's ""2001"" but they are very different films, especially when it comes to the idea of expanding knowledge. 2001 presents our next step in evolution as a transcendent  by which we are literally reborn whereas Solaris posits the idea that the next step of knowledge is so far beyond our comprehension that we may never reach it. Tarkovsky explores these ideas through visuals and a surprisingly wordy script. Still less dialogue than most films but more than other Tarkovsky films but it's written excellently anyway. A must see for anyone and everyone.

The way I see it, just opinion of course, is that you seem to want to rush everything you are doing. You want a loving girlfriend but you've only been on the first date with a few girls and clearly you committed too hard to those. A date is just supposed to be an outing to sort of...test the waters at first. Later it can be more romantic.

You can't expect someone to just drop into your hands like that though, it leaves people much too exposed and there are too many cruel people out there for that to even be remotely safe.

In terms of friends....you can call people and ask if they are up to something every now and again, hang out with them and talk about plans. It lets them know you are open and want to hang out. You just need to speed quality time with them, or get on their minds. It takes time to get into an established group.

I guess what I am saying is that all of these things take time and patience. It is good to be funny but important to show you can be serious as well. 

I understand your feelings though...I want deep and passionate love and I feel like relationships are often my burden, especially if they go astray. Still that's something you just need to work on, and hope that you will find the right person eventually.

What is wrong with just being there? Many meditations have ""just being in the moment"" as a goal. 

&gt; The things I wrote about. The dissatisfaction of my current situation.

I will re-read the thread. 

&gt; I was not referring to extreme circumstances such as war. What I wrote was more about common situations. Actually I'm glad that I never had to experience war. 

Right. But I would think it is a same thing. You were a child and you were scared so you did not run from your mother. In fact, many women end up with boyfriends that abuse them and they never try and ran away. People are like that sometimes. 

&gt; This seems to be the best thing one can do. How far did you go; did you do something really extraordinary such as embarrassing yourself in public (thinking something like ""if I can go through this I can go through everything"") or did you face more ordinary situations?

I did nothing too outrageous that I would remember. There would be times when I would try and say something funny, and it was not funny but incredibly embarrassing. But that does not phase me anymore so it did not stick with me.

&gt; Indeed it is. That's something I realized some time ago. It's just society that wants to tell you ""you have to have many friends, you need to be popular..."" etc. Sometimes it's hard to stay true to oneself under that pressure...but it's better to have few real friends than many false ones I think.

Yes, popular society is a bit twisted because people watch TV and Movies and they implicitly assume that what they see there is the norm. Many people, for example, think that going to dance clubs is fun. It is fun for some people, but not for all. So they are at the dance club, they are not having fun so they think that they need to drink more to have fun. But for most people fun is simply having a quiet conversation with a close friend. TV does not show you people who like to have a nice conversation with couple of close friends because that would be boring to watch.

The comment itself was deleted but if you check FastOCR33's comment history, it capped at +63 before it got deleted by an /r/Videos mod. Not to be confused with a later comment where he also said ""niggers gonna nig"" and got downvoted en masse.

Also, considering I got banned for using the word ""stinkpipe"" on SRS, then had the illegitimate ban upheld and labelled a homophobe and shitposter by their moderators, just because I said ""faggot"" in a different subreddit some time ago within my comment history and this guy **didn't** get banned for using the word ""nigger"" twice, I think SRS have gone downhill.

His response towards someone asking why he deleted the coment.

&gt; somewhat surprised since its pretty racist, but reddit will occasionally disregard its fanatical political correctness in order to upvote something if it amuses them(see:gradual_nigger)

His other response towards someone asking why Reddit decided to upvote his racist outburst.

**TL;DR - In the last 3 months, SRS have become militant witch hunting hypocrites of the highest calibre.

"c3xxi6o","I'm not sure where you are, but this is simply not how employment discrimination analysis works under federal, california, or new york law. There are two options: intentional discrimination or disprite impact. Intentional discrimination must be discriminatory on it's face, so a corporate document says ""X gender cannot be hired for this job"" (without a bona fide gender based reason, which is a difficult exception to fall under based on case law). Dispirited impact is an a cause of action that ends up being a battle of the experts as both sides must bring in studies showing there is either an unexplainable wage difference between genders for the same job or an unexplained unwillingness to hire a certain gender for a certain job. Neither are present here. Thus, if an attorney filed this lawsuit, the corporation could get the lawsuit thrown out with a single filed document called a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, ending the issue in a matter of days. The imaginary legal cause of action for discrimination for wages across the board in OP's story does no exist anywhere in the united states.

Brian and Veronica seem to be getting more comfortable (not in THAT way) talking to each other. Thus, the conversations are coming across more natural and more fluid with each episode. Keep that aspect going. It's hard to tell which of either of their dialogue to each other is in the script or actual adlibbed stuff. I guess when people can't tell the difference then that means you're doing a damn good job guys.


* Console love

Initially I loved the attention to consoles. Even better, a guest within IGN to sort of give you guys directly his scoops and predictions. However, overall, it felt like more of a Q&amp;A on consoles. I was hoping for more of a discussion. Brian chimed in shortly on how ""it's unfair to compare pc power to console power"". That was it though. The rest of it was a Q&amp;A. I was hoping for more discussion, more thoughts on consoles. What are your stances on the subject of next-gen consoles? Brian seemed into it but Veronica...I don't know when she made the whole comment, ""Aw that's my OLD pc. Hm."" when Daemon was talking about the ""superxbox's"" new graphics card being based on the Radeon HD 6670. That comment just seemed unbecoming of her. I took it as if she was saying ""ewww old graphics card I used on my old pc. Blah, consoles."" Since I know Veronica has had a lot of experience and interest in consoles and seeing her awesome work on Qore, I was a bit taken aback by that. Maybe I took it the wrong way and if I did I'll apologize and shutup. In no way am I trying to maliciously attack her or anything (trust me I like Veronica just as much as everyone else and initially began watching this show for her), I'm just giving honest feedback. I'm just hoping for more of a discussion where the hosts are enthusiastically/actively discussing, chiming in, making points and predictions about anything regarding consoles. My other disappointment here which isn't a big deal is lack of discussion on the PS4. I know there's not that much info on the ps4 out there yet, but there are rumors such as it having 30X more polygons from Naughty Dog's recent job listing and the fact that half of ND worked on The Last Of Us and deducing the other half working on Uncharted 4. All rumors I'm sure the senior editor would have known and could've shortly discussed and given his thoughts on.

P.S. C'mon Brian....what's your beef with blu-ray? :)

* PSA's

The funniest skits this week go to those PSA's. They were both equally funny but I think seeing Veronica's super sad face, pouty lip and her play with a random ball of yarn was a bit funnier. Mostly because of Brian laughing about her playing with yarn after her PSA was over...but....I don't know Brian's ""beard"" and egg-eating....as I said equally funny! Oh and I liked OMGchad being put into some of the skits too! He did a good job. I'm hoping for more of the funny you delivered in these ""PSA's"".

* The Score 

Interesting. Loved the ""DIC-tator"" comment. From a person that's never played Tropico before, it was very informative, Veronica showed that she played it thoroughly and she really liked it. I like when Brian and Veronica go off-topic in the conversation sometimes like they did here. Was Brian supposed to talk about a game as well? I was hoping that each week you both showcase 2 games you've been playing you really like and want to show to everyone. I'm thinking short games that are downloadable titles either from PSN or XBLA. A great game idea to showcase in a couple of weeks on The Score is ""Shank 2"". It comes out Feb 7th and I'm super stoked for it!

* This weeks ""Leet Sheet"" was fun! See this is what I'm talking about when top ""whatever"" lists can be fun.


* Interview

AWESOME. She spoke to freaking ASURA! So excited about that game and I had NO IDEA he was Asura. Off-topic please showcase Asura's Wrath in the future! Back on topic; Veronica asks such great questions I would have never thought of asking this guy. I have an interest in the VA field, especially in anime, so it was very informative for me. Great job as usual Veronica! I'm still hoping for some kind of backdrop during interviews to cover up the equipment off camera but keeping it dark and adding the purple accent light worked for me. I really liked Brian chiming in with a question. I know this is primarily Veronica's job to interview and she does an AWESOME job, but I feel Brian asking a real good relevant question(s) from time to time should be encouraged. Should've have got Liam to do more Asura yells!

* Appdiction

It was great. Loved the game showcased there. Alas, I don't have an Ipad....but in regards to how it was presented. I loved it. I didn't get the reference at first since it wasn't mentioned until afterwards. To me appdiction managed to be informative and funny at the same time. I couldn't help but love the info on the game but at the same time I was lmao at Veronica's ""whiskey binge drinking and cigar smoking"". Good work there.

* Feedback

I'm glad you're taking on-air feedback and having OMGchad lead with that. It's a great idea ending the show with audience feedback. I hope it becomes a staple in the show's lineup. Same goes for ultimately ending with either a funny, weird or quirky video. Now, I watched the YT upload since I missed 20 min of the first part of the show. I sort of like the funny comments, the giggles Brian and Veronica have when they watch these. I like seeing their reactions. It makes a video funnier, more interesting or even stranger. In the YT upload I didn't hear them as much. I would like to hear more of a ""mystery science theater 3000"" approach by the two to these weird and funny videos. Also, this is the first time I heard the ending theme song for the show and I like it a lot.

* My suggestions

Not really much I haven't already said. Continue the fluid conversations. I may sound like a nag but even more console love. Perhaps showcase some console only games that are coming out soon. If needed, myself and the rest of the audience can give you lists of top upcoming games.

* My questions

What is the possibility of having Game On! at PAX East in 2 months? Or maybe some kind of off-air event? I'm thinking slim, but it's a big gaming event and always sells out every year. I think it would be a great idea to get the show out there to new viewers. I know it's kind of far in Boston but I would love to participate as a studio audience or be one of those ""Hear ye, Hear YE. All needeth watch Game On!"" type people at PAX. I'll even bring a lantern and swing it around and such. Well, that is, if you guys could ever do something like that.

Well guys, this train is on the rails now, all it needs is a continued push to make it better each week. Which is what you all of you guys are so splendidly doing. Keep it up.

"c362g4j","My biggest, and it's afucking huge, pet peeve with Dota2 is one thing alone: The fact that every single entity seems to exist in it's own dimension. My biggest example, from what I've seen is Beastmaster's attack animation. It basically seems like it doesn't connect. At all. It seems like a weapon is swung, and not a single fuck is given. No impact, no feeling of impact, ripples, blood gushing or anything. It makes the game feel strange and kinda boring in a strange way I just can't let go of. That's a big one for me.

Otherwise, I'm personally a fan of the more ""realistic"" approach on graphics, so I'm favored towards HoN because of that. Dota2 choosing the cel-shaded artstyle seems to me like a way to save money when betting in an uncertain market (e.g. using the simplistic designstyle taken from TF2), and it looks childish to me. So graphicswise AND aestheticswise I lean to HoN. LoL falls in last on both accounts, because I read comics for comics, and play games for games. Not games for comics.

Maybe the graphics are more detailed and clean in dota2, but better; im not so sure... I'd say HoNs engine is more economical than it should be, I think it can pack a lot more punch, but is held back by the programmers.

I won't say anything on voiceacting, since I haven't seen enough of DOTA2 yet.  I enjoy HoNs stuff, it's all good except the comical bits (Drunken Brawler skin, seriously? It's funny, but stupid), but DOTA2 has some nice voiceacting on the heroes I've seen, and BMs shout sounds nice. They talk all the time after killing stuff though, which annoys me.. :p

**[samuraikarasu](http://www.youtube.com/samuraikarasu):** Definitely one of my favourite LP'ers. Very abrasive and very funny. I'm always looking forward to new videos from him. I can't believe he's so under-appreciated too. Does older games, mostly SNES and NES games.

**[HCBailly](http://www.youtube.com/hcbailly):** Plays a lot of RPGs, mostly final fantasy and Dragon quest/warrior. Good for filling in the blanks for the games in the series you may not have played. If you wanna see a quality final fantasy LP, you'll most likely find it on his channel.

"c2ip3g5","When I was little, it was just my brother and I that my mom had to take care of. She didn’t have a lot of support from my father back then.  She worked four jobs just to give my brother and I the best she could. We were always struggling and for a good part of my life growing up, we didn’t even have a phone because we couldn’t afford it. 

In my last year of high school, just my mother and I were living together. I had to get a part time job at “Dennys” of all places, just to help out with the rent. I worked 11pm-6am every second day and all weekend. It was hard keeping up with bills and simple necessities like soap and toilet-paper- to which I would usually sneak out of the storage compartments when I was taking a break so I could take them home with me.  

One Christmas was extremely depressing and it was clear to both my mum and I that it just wasn’t going to happen ‘this year’.  I was on shift one night and confessing to my nightshift partner how depressed I felt because I felt for my mum. She was devastated that we couldn’t get through a Christmas with even a Christmas tree because it was too expensive. ( we lived in an apartment building that didn’t allow real trees).  By the end of my shift, my manager comes out with an old small box and hands it to me. It was an old fake Christmas tree that they had extra, found in the back storage room. It was missing a few branches and by all accounts, it looked like a Charlie Brown Christmas tree to the ‘T’.  It was pathetic really…funny, but pathetic.  

So there it stood, on Christmas, our “Dennys” Christmas tree. A present to my mum.  That day, when I came home with it, she had been in tears, though, she looked relieved. She hadn’t told me that we were short on rent that month and when my landlord confronted her, even threatening to evict us, she started to bawl. The land lord must have been so shaken up by her reaction and our situation, that he gave us an extra month to make it up. Her present to me. 


Today, we laugh about the hardships we’ve been through. Though, there's many more stories that I could go on about. This one story, however, was the most pathetic in terms of our pride being kicked in the balls.

We all said, ""Yeah..."" and he said ""Can you all bring them in tomorrow so I can donate them"". The next day about seven of the forty or fifty that heard him brought in cellphones and he just said thanks.

Next day, at the same time, we all went to class and he was already sitting there. Nothing too weird about that. Then around 1:15 we hear a cellphone going off and the teacher, he's a huge asshole, freaked out asking who's it is.

Then at 1:16 another phone went off. Then at 1:17 another phone went off. And that proceeded for around 15-20 minutes. The guy had taken our cellphones, bought 10 more at the thrift store, set the alarms on them and then stuck them up above the ceiling tiles of the class. 

The teacher, who was incredibly mad to begin with, had a nervous breakdown and punched the black board and stormed out. We all got in major trouble, although none of us were involved and the teacher went on a two week ""vacation"". 

Also these old phones kept on going on for hours, that you could hear quite loudly through the whole school, because someone had to actually find them and he taped a few to the upside of the ceiling tile so they had to take them all down.

The teacher had his own stick he kept in the gym office. So this same weird kid went and got clear super glue (the kind that takes forever to dry) and put it all over his hockey stick.

"c1y9taf","True - Buffy did it the right way; all the time Whedon was messing around with silly, cute stories in a silly, cute universe it didn't take itself seriously, and had considerable charm.  Then as the story got darker and more serious, it started taking itself more seriously (less the odd just-for-laughs episode thrown in to keep you on your toes).  The charm made you like the show, which meant you were emotionally invested in the characters when it got more serious.

The thing was, Buffy (and Angel, and Babylon 5, and Firefly, and other good sci-fi/fantasy) has *charm* - it's confident and self-deprecating, and even when it's clever it doesn't let on that it knows it.  If it was a person it would be Nathan Fillion or Neil Patrick Harris - confident and clever, but not taking themselves too seriously and never afraid to take the piss out of themselves.

Abrams' sci-fi is like the kind of self-important idiots you sometimes run into in r/science or r/conspiracy - utterly charmless people convinced of their own genius, unaware that there's anything more to the subjects they're opining on than their own shallow misapprehensions, and apparently incapable of realising they might be less than perfect, let alone capable of making a *joke* about their own fallibility or at their own expense.

If his shows were people they'd be Deepak Chopra, or Jenny McCarthy, or Ben Stein, or a small toddler that's shuffling about in his dad's shoes with a tie looped around his neck, throwing noisy tantrums when everyone refuses to talk to him like and adult and let him drive cars.

An adult doing an impression of a kid can be funny, and a kid pretending to be an adult *who knows he's pretending* is funny, but a kid who pouts and throws a tantrum and runs around kicking shins because you won't let them drink and stay out all night is just obnoxious and annoying.

"c1xa075","* **Kamichu** - A middle school girl wakes up one morning and realizes that she is a goddess.  A funny, sweet series, and it compares quite favorably to Miyazaki.

* **Midori Days** - A reluctant juvenile delinquent wakes up one day and discovers he has a small girl attached to his arm, puppet-like, where his hand used to be.  Yeppers, you read that right.  A very funny and sometimes emotional show.  

* **Haré+Guu** - (The Japanese title is a complicated pun).  The Green Acres of anime.  A young boy living in a tropical paradise with his dingy mother get's a new younger ""sister"" named Guu.  Strange, disturbing, and extremely funny.  

* **Potemayo** - A boy discovers a small human/cat like creature living in his refrigerator between the potato salad and the mayonnaise.  Very strange cuteness occurs. 

* **Love Com** - A romantic comedy about a short boy and a tall girl.  Very sweet show with lots of wackiness. Half the fun is watching all the mugging and funny faces that Risa, the girl, makes.

* **Moyashimon** - A college comedy about a guy who can see microbes; which comes in pretty handy if the college you are going to is an agriculture school.  

* **Nanaka 6-17** - Nanaka is a serious girl high school student. Too serious according to her childhood friend.  Then one day Nanaka develops a brain disorder that causes amnesia such that she thinks she's 6 years old again.  Mostly light comedy with some equally light drama. Very likable characters.

* **NieA Under 7** - Probably the darkest of the shows listed here, but not very dark.  Set in near future Japan about 20 years after a large UFO crashed and stranded it's inhabitants. The aliens look like us except they have slightly pointy ears and some have antenna sticking out of their heads.  The show is part slice of life, part allegory about immigrants.   Think _District Nine_ but with likable characters and none of the political drama.  One of my all time favorite anime series.  The musical score, which is particularly distinctive, can only be described as Hawaiian UFO music.

* **Sketchbook Full Colors** - Slice of life show with almost no plot what-so-ever.  About a shy, quite girl who joins the school art club.  Not much ever happens in the show, and that's okay.  Watch an episode or two a week. Or a month.  Great animation and funny non-stories.  

* **Soredemo Machi wa Mawatteru** - The antidote to _Sketchbook_. Funny, raucous, and strangely thoughtful. A ditzy high school girl who wants to be a detective goes to work in a run down cafe, in a run down shopping arcade, that is trying to drum up some business by having the waitresses cosplay as maids. The head maid is in her 80s.  Stylish SHAFT animation and great vocal performances.  The OP animation is one of the wonders of the modern world.

* **Windy Tales** - Funny, but thoughtful show about a girl and her friends that become involved with a small village of ""wind tamers"".  The art style is very different, and excellent.  Another series to watch slowly over time.

"c1lnjlg","1 of 6 kids, ranging from 13 to &lt; 1 yr when were removed. I think my parents were overwhelmed with so many kids and so little money, but when my Mom got sick and was hospitalized, my Dad went to the state to try to get assistance. They did a home survey and determined neglect. A lot of my memories from that time are me fending on my own, helping to take care of the baby, getting sent home from school because I had dressed my self for school. Apparently a top and a pair of tights wasn't considered proper attire. I remember thinking my legs were covered, so I thought I was good to go!) I do wonder why only one of my 19 aunts or uncles stepped up to help. Who the hell thinks it’s best for the kids to let them go into foster care?

One big difference is that I always knew my family, always loved them, always wanted to be back with them. I saw them about once a year, though my Mom ended up separating from my Dad and living with another guy, so the State forbade contact with her unless she left him. (This was the 70's.) So, there was a period of probably 6 years I did not see her.

I was in a total of 5 homes, but was in one for 8 years. They spoke of adopting me, but I really, really did not want that. I never felt I was part of the family, and the last few years were hell, as I was being abused by a foster relative. I used to dream of escaping, and would wake up with nail prints in my palms from clenching my fists so hard. There was a huge blow-up just before I turned 16, I ended up in a temporary home, and was headed for a group home as a hard-to-place teenager. An older, child-less couple from the church I attended took compassion on me, and I moved in with them until I turned 18. They were amazing - they were educated, smart people, and turned my focus to college and a future. They even got the state of CT to agree to pay for me to go to private colleges, out of state! (Again, as this was the 70’s, I can’t imagine this would be allowed today.) I went to a religious college for 2 years, then transferred to an Ivy League college, and graduated owing only a couple thousand dollars. That was great, but there was a lot of tension with the foster parents, as they had not understood that I had a family that I wanted to see. At 18, I felt torn to choose between my family and my foster family, and I ended up not seeing my family again till my mid-20’s. My relationship never recovered with my older half-sister and half-brother, but I had a great relationship with my Mom, Dad, and 2 brothers, and ended up being primary care-giver for 3 of them before they died.  One brother had been adopted by his foster family, but died in a hit and run when he was 20. I last saw him when he was 14. So, it’s just me and my youngest brother left of our family.

I think I turned out okay. I’m funny, but prone to depression, educated but never living up to my full potential. I’ve been known to entertain friends and strangers with funny stories about growing up, but you don’t get to my age without having a lot of regrets, and I can’t help but wonder how I would have turned out if I had been raised in a loving “normal” family. I think of myself as not having been loved enough as a kid, and am not a risk-taker. I have my own home, but am very uncomfortable with friends visiting. I think it has to do with needing my own space. I’ve been married for 20 years, but never had kids, and don’t want to be a foster mom. On one hand, I could not bear having a child for a while, loving him or her, then have them taken back. On the other hand, I don’t have the temperament to allow state/agency interference in my life or to deal with all the drama of dealing with other people’s families.

I kinda want to know if any other foster kids were sexually abused in their foster homes. My half-sister was placed with the baby brother in one home, and she was removed within a year because of being abused by the father. They left the baby, and then HE was abused by the same guy as he was growing up, and this “Foster Parents of the Year” home was closed down due to abuse of several other foster kids in the home. Another brother was also abused in a temporary home, so 4 of 6 kids in my own family went through this. Abusers know these are about the most powerless kids and take advantage of that. Happily, my abusers are dead, so although I am not religious, I’m sure you’ll allow me the fantasy that they are burning in hell.  I still have lots of issues but I have had lots of therapy over the years, and highly recommend it!

But to get back to my original comment, Reddit does not report accurate counts for upvotes and downvotes.  It's intentional, in some sort of anti-spam thing that doesn't really make any sense to me.  It's impossible for anyone who isn't an admin to see the real numbers.  In the example where an admin confirmed it, the complaint was that a post had 5000 downvotes showing when really it only had 140.  It was fuzzed in that case by a factor of about 3500% so it's pretty much impossible to rely on those numbers.

Do something you have always wanted to do, but just haven't.  Everyone has those things.  Skydiving.  Go ice skating.  Go check out a canoe and ride down the river for an afternoon.

Is there a museum near by?  An art museum that you haven't been to?  You should go.  I'm not a big fan of paintings, but sometimes I see one that is just so beautiful I get lost in it.  Nothing could touch me and hurt me when I'm in that place.

Try giving a listen to K'Naan.  he is a really good artist.  Finding new music is fun.  Listen to music in a different language.  You might like it. Something random.  Hindi music is great.  There is some amazing music from Brazil that will make you want to dance.

Go withdraw $10 from your account, now you are on a mission.  You need to make somebody's day with that 10.  Buy a homeless persona  hot lunch.  Or, see a kid in a toy store and give them the 10.

Watch something silly and funny.  Step brothers always makes me laugh.  It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia is a riot.  Bill O'Reilly videos on youtube are always a funny time pass.  Megamind was a funny movie and it keeps making me smile when I watch it :D  There's an old movie from the 90s called Don't be a Menace to South Central While Drinking your Juice in the Hood.  Man, that shit is stupid and funny.  Maybe you have to grow up watching hood movies to think it's actually funny, but who knows

Go to the animal shelter and find a dog which you really think is wonderful, then ask if you can play with it for a bit.  Maybe even take on a walk.  That dog will appreciate it more than you know.  I used to work in an animal pound, the poor animals never get anyone to give them love sometimes.    Animals are a good cheer up.  


Order a pizza.  With all the toppings on it that you like.  Ask for marinara sauce on the side.  This should be a pizza day.


Buy a classic bottle of coca cola (you know, the ones in the glass bottles) and a set of crazy straws.  You know, those straws that bend around and shit.  Now you can drink coke in style.

"c1e323r","Completely re-edited version of previously useless list of just titles (14hrs after originally posted) with brief descriptions of each podcast added (these are in no particular order):

* 
**In Our Time** - In-depth discussion of a different topic each week (from Arts, Science, History, Philosophy) with 3 expert academics in the subject and the cantankerous Melvyn Bragg bullying them to talk sense.

* 
**Answer Me This** - Listeners' questions on any topic at all (several q's per show) answered by Helen and Ollie with engaging wit. You could look most of the questions up on Google, but this is much more entertaining.

* 
**Adam and Joe** - Great humor and interaction between these two British broadcasting legends that is simultaneously both subtle and silly. This would be my pick for the absolute best of British humor and possibly my favorite podcast of all, but unfortunately they're on hiatus at the moment. Due back within a couple of months though they say, and back episodes are available.

* 
**Skeptics' Guide to the Universe** - Panel of skeptics headed by Steven Novella look at science and pseudoscience stories in the news with humor. Informative and often funny, but can verge towards being a little 'preachy' at times.

* 
**The Sporkful** - Short food podcast for 'eaters, not foodies'. In-depth discussion of issues such as the best buffet strategy, what toppings a pizza should have, and how to eat a bagel.

* 
**Philosophy Bites** - Short (~20min) podcast on a topic from philosophy.

* 
**History of Philosophy** - Similar to Philosophy Bites, but as the name suggests, on a historical philosopher or topic.

* 
**The Cultural Gabfest** - Intelligent discussion about and reviews of latest movies, books, tv etc.

* 
**The Ethicist** - Two ethical queries sent in by readers answered in this very short podcast (5min) by Randy Cohen each week, e.g. things like 'My professor said he'd give me a higher grade if I help out after class'.

* 
**The Infinite Monkey Cage** - Witty science and comedy chat with Prof Brian Cox, Robin Ince and guests and audience.

* 
**The Dave Gorman Podcast** - Humorous chat with Dave, Danielle and Martin. Half the podcast is the chat from the live weekly radio show, and the other half podcast-only material including listener's submissions of real-life businesses for Pun Street.

* 
**Savage Love Podcast** - No-holds-barred sex advice for listeners' problems from the open-minded and highly entertaining Dan Savage.

* 
**The Perfect Ten** - Phil and Phil answer 10 listeners' questions in their inimitably funny way. Definitely adult-only comedy.

* 
**Frank Skinner on Absolute Radio** - Highlights of Frank's radio show with Emily and Gareth; often sparkling wit from one of Britain's top funny men.

* 
**The Moth Podcast** - People telling real stories from their lives on stage; can be compelling, funny, sad, bizarre, unsettling - depending upon the story and storyteller.

* 
**Buzz Out Loud** - Daily tech news from Molly Wood and the gang.

* 
**Stuff You Should Know** - Chuck and Josh give you the lowdown on a different topic each week in their easy-going and likeable yet informative style.

* 
**Stuff You Missed In History Class**, **Stuff to Blow Your Mind** - Also from the SYSK stable, 2 podcasts covering history and 'mind-blowing ideas'. Presenters not quite as engaging as Chuck and Josh, but good informative content.

* 
**Wiretap** - Surreal slices from the comedy life of Jonathan Goldstein.

* 
**Friday Night Comedy** - Weekly topical comedy from the BBC. Alternates between the brilliant News Quiz (panel comedy news game) and the not quite so funny Now Show (sketch show based on the week's news).

* 
**Material World** - Latest developments in science with the astoundingly enthusiastic Quentin Cooper interviewing the actual scientists and other people involved.

* 
**Great Lives** - Biography series: A celebrity chooses someone who's no longer with us as their great life, and discusses why with an expert on the person they've chosen and host Matthew Parris. Often fascinating alternate views even of people you thought you knew all about.

* 
**The Front Row Podcast** - Latest in the world of movies, plays, books, and culture with intelligent interviews with the directors, stars and authors by the incisive Matthew Lawson, who caused Russell Crowe to storm out in anger last year.

I had a BLAST at RIT.  I made some of the best friends anyone could ever ask for.  I had professors that talked to me on a peer level.  The counselors actually worked for me and worked their ASSES off for me.  I had a fantastic job working in my labs I was a Labbie -&gt; TA -&gt; GA and loved every moment of it.  The people were personable but awkward, funny but serious, out of their minds and scary smart.  I now have my dream job working for a mecha in my industry and I put other new hires that started with me to shame.

Anyone who tells you that there isn't anything to do on campus isn't willing to admit that they don't know where to look all the time.  I had a fantastic social life.  I had fun on campus and a blast off campus.  Rochester is a great city, there are a lot of good bars (when you can), great clubs, fantastic restaurants, all sorts of great things.

"c19dksn","Pedobear has the type of face you just want to trust, but underneath those saucer-like black eyes and cheerful smile, there is a much darker side. Though is appearance is that of a cute stuffed animal, his name tells you there is something deeper in there. Something more sinister, and that is indeed the truth.

The appeal of Pedobear is not a huge mystery. On the internet, where cute images and obscenities mix and mingle, he works as a mixture of both to appeal to both the sinister and the less than deviant corners of the internet -- this is what makes him so universally recognized and accepted. Anyone can understand the humor in Pedobear, as long as they do not take him seriously.

Casual web users and internet addicts alike can find solace in his cute face, while getting a nice chuckle out of the fact that he is indeed not what he seems. This is not an effect that many people are fully aware of, but in fact if Pedobear were somehow less cute and more menacing, he would likely not be anywhere near as popular; he definitely would not have lasted from 2004 to today. No -- Pedobear is and always has been so popular because of his looks. The jokes are funny, but the well-tuned mix between naughty and nice is what makes him shine.

Pedobear's mixture of appeals is what makes him stand out from the hundreds of other memes. Some internet communities may know of some memes while others have their own, but Pedobear has found his way into nearly all of the facets of the internet. In some cases, some of which by clever individuals with Photoshop, he has even made his way into the real world.

Another thing that makes him so popular is the controversy surrounding his love of little girls. The vast majority of people do not advocate this type of behavior, and some of which do not see the black humor in Pedobear. This has caused some trouble in the past, and is likely to again. The internet, with its vast trolls and lovers of inside jokes, is often overjoyed at someone's misunderstanding of the Pedobear meme, especially if it makes it into the media. His mentions in the media are also a contribution to his popularity, as awareness grows from people who had never heard of him before. He is one of the few memes to actually make it outside of our computer screens and into the newspapers.

Though not for the easily offended or simply easily confused, Pedobear does have a solid place in internet culture as what a meme should be. Though he obviously does not come up with his material on his own, hundreds and even thousands of people have put thought into different ways to make the meme funny and resilient. Black humor, a charming face, and the appreciation of hundreds of thousands of people worldwide are what have ultimately led to his continuous popularity. With no relation to politics, race, or social issues Pedobear falls into a category that makes it difficult to actually ""get old"". This may actually be the biggest driving force behind his continued dominance in comparison to other, more current event-relevant internet fads and memes.

second preface: I do not have the ability to get up there and do what you did. 

That being said, I think that I can still offer some hopefully helpful criticism.

You have to have a ""I don't care"" attitude to be liked. a couple of times it seemed like you were trying to feel out what the audience thought, and it came off a little like you cared. For instance:

@4:10 ""if you don't vote you got no right to complain--you guys agree with that?"" These are Americans drinking, of course they are going to say that they agree with something if it sounds even slightly logical. I know you are trying to set them up for your shockingly opposite position (which is *very* funny) but it sounds too much like you are actually worried how much they agree, and if they will accept your position. I think it would come off better (because of this) if you had a ""fuck that"" attitude, and then went on the offensive a little bit in your tone when you start the whole ""Stockholm syndrome"" bit. (also very funny and witty)

Also:

@2:20 The ""Are you suicidal"" one needs a little work. I like the punchline: ""we got one of them 'Paradoxes' "" I say work on it because it sounds like it could be a really good joke, but you need to discover/create it better.

""I'm not tryin' to defend anarchy"" -- might make a joke about ""its not anarchy if you feel you need to defend it"" (again, going in the same line of ""don't give a damn about the non-consentual belief.)

Because jokes cannot be protected by patent law, you either have to have unusually witty insights, or you have to do what most successful comics do and develop a stage ""personality"" that isn't easy to mimic. The ""I don't give a fuck"" attitude is important and helps with this.

I think that if these points are not too general, you will see that they will help you with the ""redneck hick stereotype"" bit in the beginning as well.

**td;lr**: great stuff! try to kick it up a notch by using a ""no fucks given"" approach to developing a personality that can carry this material even further and make it more effective.

thats my peace.

EDIT: for clarity: I don't tend to love Dave Chapelle too much, but this clip is on the same subreddit right now, and if you notice, as soon as he says something in this bit that is shocking to the audience, he pauses to make it that much more impacting, with a ""What?""

"c1664ab","I went through the same thing there. They laughed at me. ""You're on acid, go do acid things"" They were still fucked up from the day drinking. I didn't trust them. I ran back to my apartment. By the time I got there, I had forgotten my hand had hurt and was more concerned about my beating heart. I think my hearts gonna explode. I might die of exhaustion. Am I thirsty? ""Water!"" I panted, collapsing on the ground. My friends look up from the TV, ""Are you alright man?"" ""I'm dehydrated, I need water."" Sober friend says ""Here, I'll go to 711 and get you water."" I throw him my wallet too distressed to deal with it. 

He's gone and 30 seconds later, I'm pacing. Where is he? This is how people die on LSD, dehydration. OH. WHAT AM I DOING. Water comes out of the faucet duh. I spend 5 minutes looking for a clean cup. ""Dude, just use your hands"". Duh. I'm drinking water faster than ever before, when OH NO. This is how people die on LSD. Drinking too much water. I stop and and I sit very still. I wake up my roommate 

""John! John! are you sober?!"" 

*grunt* ""What? Aren't you on acid right now""

""John I hurt myself. Can you check me out?""

""Dude. Acid."" He puts on a CLEARLY fake smile and starts making childrens noises and jumping around. I know he's faking it. But I feel better. 

""John, I think I hurt myself. I might have to go to the hospital""

""WOOO!! WOO!! ACIDDD YEAHH!! Let's listen to some Ronald Jenkees and dance"" still in a I-just-woke-up-and-out-of-it stage. 

My friend comes back with the water and I forget all about it. Im tired. What am I doing. ""Guys, I'm going to sleep. I'll seeya tomorrow"" They look unphased. I undress into my boxers and get into bed. Bed feels weird. Wet. I get a text message, ""Yo, what're you up to right now?"" I send one back ""Tired and confusded"". Of course, my friend rushes over to check on me. By the time he had gotten there, I was convinced I was stuck forever. My heart was beating so loudly that the cops were gonna come. I imagined the cops busting through my door and arresting me for being too loud. My parents would see me tripping on LSD. My parents. They can help me here. I dial in my Mom's number. I hesistate. Wait. I should not call my mom on acid. But I love my mom and my dad. They would understand. I can do anything and they would still love me. My rational mind kick it. I run outside my room in my boxers and throw my phone across the room. ""KEEP THAT AWAY FROM ME! Only bad things can happen if I use that"". John had invited two girls over and three guys were there too. I looked at them kind of laughing at me. I didn't care. 

I went back to sleep. Nope. No sleep. I'm gonna shower. I get out of bed, get naked in the bathroom and feel the hot shower on me. It feels funny but refreshing. I step out of the shower, dry off. I open my eyes. Im in bed. Naked. Completely dry. What? I realized I had only imagined going in the shower and my mind had literally reenacted every sense necessary for me to believe I took a shower. I felt and saw everything while lying in my bed dreaming. What was going on? I went outside, and beckoned my sober friend out onto our balcony.

""Dude. After this acid trip, I'm never doing acid again. I'm throwing it all away, I don't want it""

He laughs. Unfortunately he's a very sarcastic person. ""Really? You're gonna throw it all away huh?""

""Yep. I'm done with this. I almost called my mom. Kyle. I think I'm gonna kill myself."" I peered over the edge of the balcony

He laughs again, ""Are you being serious dude?"" 

""Whats the point of living man?""

He stammers for a second. He looks inside as if for reinforcement. ""There's a lot to live for. You wanna smoke a cigarette?""

""Sure""

""My lighters inside, help me find it""

I go inside and forget that whole conversation happened for the mean time. I go back to my room, go in the bathroom and start to puke into the toilet. The most awkward strange feeling ever. I don't know why I'm puking. I feel like I'm dying. I finish puking and go back outside to the living room where my friends are watching a Star Wars marathon laughing at all the unfunny parts. I think they're laughing because they're having as bad of a time as I am and they're laughing to keep their mind from leading them down a bad trip. I start to laugh too. Not because anythings funny, but... just because. The movie ends, and my friends decide to leave except for one of them. He hangs out, the others leave. Right when the others leave we start to come down from the peak, roughly 6-7 hours after we had taken it. A 6-7 hour peak on acid.

We start to listen to music and my other roommate comes home on a bunch of MDMA. We start listening to music and dancing and singing and life is good. I go to my other LSD trip buddy's place and we play beerpong. I learn a lot about myself. We run into a bunch of friends on molly and we start giving each other light shows and massages and we meet new people. Life is good. But the experienced has scarred me.

The *worst* part of the Daily Show is when Jon Stewart decides to adhere to that tired formula.  At least when Colbert does it, Colbert stays in character- which is the brilliance of the show.

Don't get me wrong- all the late night talk show guys do have their moments-  and Conan disproportionately so.  Even still, the small amount of quality comedy they produce gets distilled with an hour of luke-warm time wasters, making for a watered-down underwhelming experience.

I wish Conan had followed in Bill Maher's footsteps and done a weekly show on premium cable: uncensored, unrushed, quality comedy, densely packed into an hour long block.

Instead he's moved to some basic cable channel that I'll never watch, to do a show that simply can't be worth my time.  If he does anything really hilarious, someone will post it on the internet, and I won't have had to watch 10-15 hours of lukewarm comedy to get there.

It was a small hole in the wall that allowed residents of a city to enter at night when the gates were closed.

A bit funny, once I emailed a client I was working with, and thanks to my fetish for proof reading all emails before I send them, I read the first line in horror.

His name was Alan and he is gay. And knowing the customer well, I don't think he'd appreciate the typo.

It's fun and I'd probably still do it occasionally if it didn't cost me anything to do.

It can feel degrading at times. I know some customers see me as nothing but a piece of flesh. Other customers crumple dollar bills to throw at me while I'm dancing, aiming to hit me (at which point I very gently tell them to please stop fucking doing that - it's like throwing peanuts at an elephant). It's not only customers who tend to feel more at ease if I strike up conversation with them while dancing, but it makes me feel at ease too; I can better help them understand that I'm every bit as human as they are.

In a way it *is* prostitution - you're using your body for money in the sex industry. However, I do feel that I'm selling my art (it's a show; watch me dance and move). With sex for money, I feel like prostitutes sell their bodies (you're paying to use her body for sex). It's a very fine line, I admit.

Hmm, what story should I tell? This one didn't happen personally, nor in the club, but to an employee of the club: he dressed in scrubs, went to a hospital and walked right in. He went to the cafeteria, picked up a female nurse and brought her home to fuck her. Except, he didn't bring her to his crap shack; he brought her to his boss's house (the owner of the club) and fucked her in his bed, all while the boss was on vacation.

Even better buck the narrow seat trend completely and get a normal cruiser saddle seat and tilt it radically forward. You will bike better and be more comfortable.

I used to ride 25 miles easily every day.
It's very fast and easy (about an hour or less if you think about it).

Get a used good race bike rather than an expensive new non race bike if you have financial limits.

My excellent Cannondale cost me $200 used. It's excellent. 
(and remember you don't want the lightest weight - you want the most frictionless lowest rolling resistance bike so better to get an old low rolling resistance metal bike than a newer bad bike.)

Keep ties inflated hard.

Get padded gloves to keep the vibrations from going through your wrist or you will bruise.

Carry tube blow out kits and a pump . You'll definitely lose tubes to punctures and if you are off a well travel route without a replacement tube you are sunk.

Drink a large glass of water before you get on your bike. The extra hydration will give you a lot more endurance. Carry two water bottles on a 1 hour ride. You will drink them both.

Never drink coffee before riding. Coffee will actually hurt your time and endurance after the first 30 minutes because it will dehydrate you.
(I tested this extensively myself. Ironically you FEEL like you have more energy because your heart is beating faster but you actually perform much worse.)

Get a mirror that mounts on your helmet not your handle bars. The ones on the handle bars always move at the crucial moment and are vibrating loose.  With the helmet mirrors to simply tilt your head and have a wider field of view behind you (essential for street travel.)
A mirror is ESSENTIAL.

Never pull over to the side if you don't have room or the shoulder is soft if a car is coming up behind you. You will be squashed or fall in front of a car that hasn't had to slow down.

Instead move into the center of the lane so the car will definitely slow down and then move away as you can or make him pass you.

A car passing at 40 mph is an extreme danger to you. They don't realize how little a misjudgement can put you under their rear wheels.
They will try to pass you liek a car with minimal distance between you. That's extremely dangerous to you and they don't realize it. If they or you miss you won't dent - you will die.

You are better off forcing them to slow down.

"c0papwj","It's funny, but most people assume that because something is digital it automatically means its better.

This is not the case.

Film still has many major advantages over digital, some of which are disappearing but many of which are not.

First is the look-- there are, as of yet, no digital cameras that look as good as film does. Video cameras, even HD video cameras, simply don't stand a chance against a properly exposed 35mm negative. An easy comparison would be listening to vinyl vs. MP3-- vinyl simply sounds better.

There are a handful of formats and cameras that have come close (Arri D21, RED), but they need a LOT of wrangling in post-production to achieve proper results.  This effectively means that any advantage these cameras purport to have over film in terms of cost disappears once you move into post-production.

Then there's the issue of archiving.  Right now, a good old-fashioned film print is still the most reliable archive tool available-- for the simple reason that the fancy codec you use today might be totally unreadable in 60 years time, and you would spend crazy amounts of time and money looking for legacy devices to unlock whatever footage you have stored on your hard-drive-- which will itself by that point be totally obsolete.

It's also been estimated that a single frame of film can store the equivalent of 12k lines of resolution... what essentially amounts to 12,000p (vs. the 1080p resolution of your HDTV).  I think comparisons like this are a bit pointless... but it helps to think of it this way: when you watch a film at the cinema, light is shone through a see-through piece of plastic that is 3.5cm wide.  The image on that plastic strip is blown-up thousands of times, to the size of your cinema screen-- and still the lines are clear and sharp, every detail perfectly clear.

Yes, some of it comes down to cinematographers wanting to work with what they know.  But by the same token, the film industry is like any tech field, and to stay on top, you need to know the latest technology.  

Most cinematographers I know are very interested in the digital technologies, but those DoP's who work with both formats still quite often prefer film.

The only people who unequivocally say that digital is better are the ones who have never worked with film.

Since people are downvoting, I've decided to provide a link to this documentary, with several Hollywood professionals talking about why they prefer film over digital.

Or if they are, they just make up the story (like in this thread, where the pretty lady in question was said to be intelligent because she was a trekkie, because she had a bob haircut, and because she had certain inherited facial traits that pointed towards intelligence).

"c0gxkcy","It's been almost 3 years now that I have been following TDS with Jon Stewart.

Really funny. Stewart is not the best actor, but can read shit off of the tele-prompter and somewhat make imitations.

Here is the thing I realized the other day; I would appreciate it if anyone has the means to check it out and tell me if it is indeed correct or not.

The chairs for the people being interviewed. The chair is more irritating for a guy they don't like. For instance; 

Joe Biden's chair was perfectly mobile and allowed him to move around in the general area he was sitting in and thus form whatever body language he wanted.

Lance Armstrong's chair's wheels seemed locked. The chair was standing somewhat far from the table, so the person sitting in it wouldn't be able to parcel out a space on the table during the interview and this would in turn make it easier for Stewart to chew them out. Of course, Armstrong wouldn't take those childish games and physically lifted the chair and carried it closer to the table. 

That brings me to Dan Rather. Man, they really hate that guy. He knows exactly what he's talking about, and maybe that is why they hate him for telling things so openly. His chair was placed away from the table like Armstrong's and the wheels were possibly locked because the chair didn't slide over easily like for the other interviewees, when he tried to pull it from under the table.

Long story short, TDS is just another propaganda tool. It's funny, so I watch it, but I stopped listening to what Stewart would like me to believe, a long time ago. 

Since I'm out on show bashing here, I want to say that;

* Jimmy Fallon should quit before there are still people on this planet who think he can make jokes
* Steven Colbert is just a terrible, terrible actor with clearly inferior writing compared to TDS. He should do something other than playing the stale character of righteous American citizen.
* Conan O'Brien *can* be funny. An indication is early Simpsons. However, during a late night show, he becomes Bart. This funny but otherwise irrelevant person. He does a great job of making people laugh, but that's about it.

Funny but true story of when I was ""arrested"" in 7th grade for lighting a trash barrel on fire in the recess yard:

I was near the smokers and the trash bin when a teacher came out during recess.  They all threw their cigs into the trash and moved away.  I was about 5 feet away with 2 other kids and didn't notice the thing turning to smoke and fire behind us as the teacher walked toward us.  We were busted for causing the fire, even though none of us had anything to do with it.

They called the cops who took us to the station (to teach us a lesson I guess).  I was terrified.  They couldn't reach my father, and were trying to reach my mother.  I remember crying and begging the officer not to call my mom, just keep trying for my dad.  I mean, I was freaked out as I knew what was in store.  

At one point he asked me why I was so afraid of my mother.  I told him whole heartedly I thought she would kill me the second she sees me if she found out.  He looked at me in good humor said, do you think with all of these officers around here that we would let your mother kill you?

I distinctly remember looking around the room and telling him ""You don't have enough.""

I meant it.

They put me in a holding cell, called my mother anyways.  OMG, I was terrified.

When they released me to her she drug me by my hand out of the building and started laughing and laughing.  I kept telling her I didn't light thing on fire it was the other kids, but she kept laughing.  I was told to go to my room, and nothing happened.

Years later my mother recounted this story to me from her side.  She said that when the officer called her and said why I was at the police station, he concluded with ""Lady, what is your secret?  Your son is absolutely convinced you will kill him and our entire police force won't be enough to stop you.""

I started programming on a Commodore 64 when I was 10 years old, and decided that I'll make video games too.

Today, some 25 years later, my current computer is roughly one billion times as fast as the one back in the day if you measure in the quad-GPU computation power.

One billion times that performance means that a computation taking one second today, would have taken a [bit over 31 years](http://www.google.fi/search?q=1+billion+seconds+in+years). Say, a pretty Mandelbrot fractal picture for example, painted diligently pixel by pixel.

My computer from 25 years ago would still be crunching away on this for another half a dozen years, in which time my current computer is likely to have improved in performance by a full magnitude.

Even my trusty iPhone clocks easily enough power to *emulate* the Commodore 64. So now I can write games that use thousands of times the power and run graphics I couldn't imagine back in the day, fit in my pocket, connect wirelessly to the Internet, and I can sell to thousands of people around the world for less than a dollar each.

[IHateTheMedia] (http://www.IHateTheMedia.com) is a good site as is [LittleGreenFootballs] (http://www.LittleGreenFootballs.com), but they're there to respond to what many conservatives view as slanted or hypocritical media stories.  

Not that I can't blame them, especially as an NPR listener.  They've got great reporting and they're thorough, but as a Washington, DC policy attorney, I know what both sides of the story usually are, and they often times don't report both sides.  What a reporter *doesn't* say is often times more telling about their slant than what they *do* say.  After a while, I just get so frustrated that I end up listening to some Morning Zoo shit for a while just to purge myself.

Of course, the same thing applies to Reddit.  The posts here are very intelligent and really funny, but the constant attack on conservatives just gets too much.  The funny thing is that I HATE conservatives - or at least the stereotypes that most folks on Reddit lambaste, too.  Bible thumping, racist, stick-up-the-bum, don't-suck-never-mind-spit-or-swallow, evangelical, homophobic pricks/prickettes give us a bad name.  

Personally, I consider myself conservative because I don't want to see the country get in deeper debt, I believe that markets work (with minimal but affirmative government oversight), I'd rather pay les taxes than more, Presidents should negotiate from power, the ouster of Saddam was right but the way we went about it was ass-wrong, I thought John McCain would be an okay President (but an awful campaigner 8 years past expiration), and I believe in God.  

However, my conservative friends look at me askance because I thought Sarah Palin was an idiot (but probably a good lay), Obama is inspiring (but not yet ready to lead or govern effectively), W was unable to lead or govern effectively (but could be impressive in person), I'd like to see education get funded like we really mean it, and we should have a health-care plan for everyone (not like medicare, but more like the one Federal employees get).  Socially, I honestly feel that raunchy-kinky-woo-hoo sex is awesome, abortions are awful but who the hell am I to say you can't have one, and everything in the Bible is inspired by God but not everything is revealed by God.   Who, for all I know, is probably the sum of all the laws of physics who likes to touch off Big Bangs every now and then. And who doesn't give a rat's ass whether or not you touch yourself.

&gt; The only person I could really count on was her.

This is dangerous -- try to remember that the only person you can really count on is you. At the end of the day, you are responsible to yourself among everyone else. 

&gt; People don't generally like me, which has let me with very few friends.

Why do you feel like people don't like you? Is it something you do that annoys them or do you not really like them...?

&gt; When I meet new people they're hardly interested in me, I make conversation with them and try to be nice, confident and funny but they never really like me or want to be friends with me. 

Do you think you're actually that confident/nice? Try to be positive and smile a lot.. it seems to me from your post that you have low self-esteem, which people don't really like. Next time you interact with someone, try to more aware of how you come off to them, or how you think you're coming off. 

&gt;What kind of behavior leads people to be uninterested in you?

What I have found so far is that negativity/whing are huge turn-offs for people. That's not to say you need to be perfect 100% of the time, but maybe try to change your outlook. Try to be more hopeful/optimistic, even if you aren't really.. people like to be around other happy people. So, good smiles, give compliments, be interested, ask lots of questions. **Be engaging**. It's amazing to me, that people will think your interesting just because you ask lots of questions about them. In a lot of ways, I felt like I was like you.. I'm a nerd at heart and didn't have parents to teach me these ""social rules"", so I had to learn them as I went along. They definitely weren't innate to me. Try to not feel bad about what you're going through -- I wish someone told this to me earlier in life: don't compare yourself to others; compare yourself to yourself, and you'll see how much you have grown. 

I'm stealing the following from a [blog post](http://www.positivityblog.com/index.php/2008/04/02/16-things-i-wish-they-had-taught-me-in-school/) that I found to be interesting: 

----------

 **First, give value. Then, get value. Not the other way around.**

This is a bit of a counter-intuitive thing. There is often an idea that someone should give us something or do something for us before we give back. The problem is just that a lot of people think that way. And so far less than possible is given either way.

If you want to increase the value you receive (money, love, kindness, opportunities etc.) you have to increase the value you give. Because over time you pretty much get what you give. It would perhaps be nice to get something for nothing. But that seldom happens. 

--------

**Don’t beat yourself up.** 

Why do people give up after just few mistakes or failures? Well, I think one big reason is because they beat themselves up way too much. But it’s a kinda pointless habit. It only creates additional and unnecessary pain inside you and wastes your precious time. It’s best to try to drop this habit as much as you can.

-------

**Assume rapport.**

Meeting new people is fun. But it can also induce nervousness. We all want to make a good first impression and not get stuck in an awkward conversation.

The best way to do this that I have found so far is to assume rapport. This means that you simply pretend that you are meeting one of your best friends. Then you start the interaction in that frame of mind instead of the nervous one.

------------

From my experience, the general idea is to be positive and engaging. There's a lot out there to read about being more sociable.. try to spend some time reading, learning, and practicing. You'll make mistakes, but that's all part of the process. You sound like a good guy, so don't get frustrated. 

**Edit:** Not to pump this blog up too much, but there is some good information on there, actually. Try [this](http://www.positivityblog.com/index.php/2006/11/05/do-you-make-these-10-mistakes-in-a-conversation/) post for some conversation tips, and [this](http://www.positivityblog.com/index.php/2007/09/10/how-to-improve-your-social-skills/) page for some general ideas. This guy isn't pedalling a product from what I see, so it seems to be pretty geniune. 

**Edit 2:** Sorry to be rambling on, but what sorts of things are you interested outside of work? I'm seeing you read and watch movies, so maybe hang around a bookstore or something and try to strike up small conversation with someone over a book you read or movie you saw? It doesn't need to lead to anything, but just have a couple good 5-10 minute conversations to get your confidence going. Unless they're in a bad mood or in a rush, people are general very social, so give it shot. How does that sound?

"c0auai3","No one has said anything about it being wrong for a woman to express her sexuality. I applaud the effort. I would be willing to bet that ewicki and afungi do too.

This is the real world, though. There are risks. There are diseases. There are accidental pregnancies. There are husbands and wives, dedicated lovers... and there are families. And there are emotional bonds shared between these people, and these bonds can be shattered by any one false move.

Two personal anecdotes (absolutely true):

1. Back during my junior year (ha, my first junior year), I was dating this cute Italian girl. Brown hair, brown eyes, Roman nose... And she liked to ""express herself,"" too. (Oh, did she ever!) We were not exclusive, but we thoroughly enjoyed each other's company (in the bedroom, and out). Guess what happened to her! She ended up going home with the wrong guy in order to ""express"" her sexuality. She ended up with genital warts. She lost me, and lost the respect of lots of people in the dorm... with the worst of the bunch actually taunting her about it, anonymously. She dropped out a few weeks later. I'm sure she returned to school, she really wanted to pursue her degree... But she was embarrassed, tormented and wasted thousands of dollars. (How much is one fleeting orgasm, again? If she even came?)

2. One of my old roommates dated a girl that was very cute, funny, but very shy. The girl was very socially conservative (read: ""backward""). My roommate tried to get into her pants with no success. After a couple of months, they broke up. (He needed to express his sexuality. Ha!)

So, this girl ended up getting together with this old friend from the same town. (It was a university town. She grew up in the town, but still went to college there.) They actually got married about a year or so later. Supposedly, according to her old roommate, the couple was divorced a year and some odd months later. She ended up hooking up with a some number of guys in the subsequent months. She is now pregnant, divorced and her parents will not speak to her. (Well, at least her dad won't, from what I'm told.) And if the child's father is as low-class as I've been told, well, good luck to the little one...

Anyway... If you've made it this far, awesome. Thank you. Now I want to clarify a few things. First, I'm not saying that expressing your sexuality is a bad thing. It's a great thing. We're human. We find great pleasure in sex. It allots us a bond that most animals cannot imagine. Second, I'm not suggesting that there is only one way to express your sexuality -- without proper protection, and so on. It can be expressed with more than one partner in safety, and without breaking one partner's trust. Third, I'm not commenting on the specifics of the women in the article, and certainly not on your life.

But I will maintain this: expressing your sexuality is fun, exciting and can really be a great, healthy thing. But there are risks involved, and they're amplified dramatically as you increase the number of partners that you have (at one time, or overall), as well as by partaking in certain activities which affect your judgment (alcoholic consumption, doing drugs, etc).

And I'm just speaking of the physical risks, there. I'm not talking about the emotional damage. A woman who wanted to experience what it was like to be with another woman, or with a man of another race, may be expressing herself by doing this behind her lover's back, but she may also end up being caught by said lover... An event which will leave the other devastated, and we know how nasty that can get. And not to mention if they had a child together!

At this point, most women in your position will try to bring up that it's ok as long as it's done with the proper precaution. Ok, great, I'll agree with you. If you're safe about it, if you're only having sex with partners who you've confirmed as clean, if you wear protection, use birth control, don't do it behind a partner's back, etc, then that's great. But then, really, you'll be changing your original position. From then on, ""expressing her sexuality"" will be ""safely and intelligently expressing her sexuality."" And that, few will contend with.

"c08uutj","I'd love to follow you with a camera, because I have a guess that some of the the ""scary black dudes"" are people who I would say ""hi"" to, maybe exchange a few polite words, and then sit on the bench beside.

[edit] I want to expand on why I am reacting to Kdubya's comments this way (not that I think this will reduce the downmods--I suspect the opposite--but because I don't want to be perceived as making an unfair judgment or being an advocate of political correctness). I see many people these days using ""rebellion"" against political correctness as a convenient cover for *actual* racism. These people are paranoid and overreact to the actions of a minority to strengthen their opinions. 

A great example is the ""I wish I could say 'white' or 'black,' but we are so politically correct we can't say it anymore."" This is bullshit. I say white and black frequently, and avoid annoying terms like ""African American"", and I've NEVER been called for it-- not by my friends (among them a multicultural advocate at my university, who is in charge of racial relations in a dorm, and my black ex-girlfriend), not by black people I've been arguing with about racial issues, and not even by whiny liberals. I'm sure there are some small group of people protesting the label ""black"", but they wield no power and are not representative. To act like you're threatened, or your freedom of speech is impaired by these people, is to be paranoid or worse, to be intentionally misrepresenting the other side.

KDubya said ""what's so scary about it? It's a white guy surrounded by scary black dudes."" For the record, I upmodded the comment, because I appreciate a blunt/crude observation as much as the next guy. I make racist jokes/comments from time to time. The difference is, I would never try and defend it as not being racist, or act like a phrase like that is not racist. How can you justify describing uniformed men with every appearance of being calm and professional as ""scary black men?"" The comment was funny, but absolutely racist.

Finally, further down the thread, he defines the new racism as ""people assuming you're racist."" What does this mean? We can look at it a lot of ways, so I'm gonna pick two-- first, let's take the black man who assumes that white people around him are thinking racist thoughts. KDubya, I am certain, would be the first to point a finger at the man and say he's racist for assuming that whites are being racist towards him-- and I would agree. So would most people, although depending on his history, we may empathize with him (it's likely most black men have encountered racism at some point in their lives.) So in this case, the paranoia itself is because of racism. 

I say it applies equally in the opposite case-- when someone like KDubya looks at a black person and assumes that the black person thinks he's racist, KDubya is being racist. It's a symptom, or perhaps a self-defense mechanism. And if he's saying things that he thinks may be deemed racist by whites, he's going to be paranoid that the liberal whites around him are considering him racist-- but if saying these things makes you uncomfortable in this way, most people would stop saying them. That he feels compelled to continue under the guise of ""fighting political correctness"" to me indicates some level of racism.

So anyway, yes, I'm making a snap judgment on little evidence, but what evidence I have all points in the same direction, namely, that kDubya is just a little bit racist. (And yes, I've seen Avenue Q-- the important point is to get him to acknowledge it instead of defending it or using as a badge of honor.)",1239741089,"the comment was funny, but absolutely racist.","funny, but absolutely","funny","but",TRUE,"funny , but absolutely racist","racist",NA,"absolutely",1
"c08u6am","Alright.   So I used to hang out with this guy I met in college.  He and his girlfriend came from a town near my hometown that was known for its racism.  The High schools mascot was a dragon if that helps paint the picture for you.  He was not racist where as his girl friend had a bit of a racist streak in her.    This may get long im sorry.

So, my buddy Justin, loved riding his motorcycle and was very good at making new friends.  He and his bike buddies were out riding and met a new guy i can't remember his name.  But they all thought he was just a really dark skinned white guy. like he had a killer tan.  One night while they were all out riding he says that his dad wants to come join them and will meet them is such and such parking lot.  They all roll over to the meeting place and he says hey theres my dad.  Justin and his group say where.  He says over on the purple bike pulling into the parking lot.   Justin was so confused b.c he only saw a black guy riding up when it occurred to them  ""hey this guy is really black not tan.""  So either wya they hit it off great and this guy came out to one of the parties with his white GF.  So every one at the party except for Justins GF ""Kristen"" knew that he was in fact black.  So they got to talking about how Kristen used to work at I think it was texas road house.  So she says ""Yea, I used to work at the one over on such and such street but had to quite b.c there were too many ""N""ers""   I have never seen a room clear out so fast.

Kristen made her way out of the room with evey one looking at her funny.  She asked what was up.  Her friend took her out side to explain he was black and such.  They came back in and every one started drinking much more heavily.  The black guy didn't get all shitty as one would expect.  He was really cool.

The Playerkiller/Non-Playerkiller crowd create an interesting dynamic. The NPK group is generally comfortable with PKs, as long as they’re on their own server. The PKs, however, are infuriated at the prospects that (a) not everyone enjoys PvP combat, and (b) they will not have the opportunity to make these people “enjoy” PvP combat. This leads them to insist upon unrestricted PvP on all servers, at which time the overwhelming NPK majority proceeds to tear them new assholes. Any rational person knows that few developers would willingly bring upon themselves the fury of the “carebear brigade”, so the argument is pointless, having already been decided a year ago by the developers. The PKs never learn their lesson, and move from game to game, demanding “hard core” PvP, not getting it, and leaving frustrated and screaming, “see you in Shadowbane, n00bs!”

There is a special breed of imbecile that only lurks message boards, rarely posting anything at all. How do they cause trouble, you ask? These people are “professional ranters”. Confident in the knowledge that being a writer for a website gives them a “unique perspective” and makes them right about everything, they do not hesitate to spit out the most inane, mind-numbing tripe you’ll ever have the misfortune to read.

Some ranters were genuinely insightful and funny, but all of them have retired. The only function now served by the ranters of old is for people to falsely claim some sort of connection to them ­ as a “guest writer” or, heaven help us, an “avid reader” in a desperate attempt to gain even the tiniest scrap of legitimacy for their site and/or message board posts. Naturally, these claims
are, in a word, bullshit, and the Great Ranter of yore wouldn’t be caught dead associating with these inbred degenerates.

The final, most contemptible group is also not to be found on the public message boards. This group is the “cynical veterans”. These people can only be found posting their pseudo-intellectual crap on the tiny, hovel-like forums of their rant site of choice. They turn up their noses at the “great unwashed masses” on the mainstream boards, yet somehow manage to actually be more ignorant, cliquish, and childlike than any of them.

The cynical veterans’ claim to fame is that they have played every MMOG since UO and probably read “The Rantings of Lum the Mad” regularly. Typically, these people submitted dozens of articles to Lum, none of which were even remotely coherent enough to be published. After the departure of Lum, they scurried off to various wannabe sites authored by their fellow rejects. Having failed to achieve fame on the front page, they take to the message boards, where they write rambling, disorganized posts with many long sentences and big words that they had to look up in an online thesaurus. You will often see them parroting “I disagree with what you said,” in reference to a very old post made on the LtM boards by someone with an actual job. It was a tired insult almost immediately, but lacking a triple-digit IQ to call their own, the cynical veterans still consider it riotously funny and clever.

Every last one of the cynical veterans professes to be tired of the “xp treadmill” and repeatedly threatens to leave the genre entirely. As a rule, however, they are emotionally incapable of actually doing so, and will continue to purchase every new MMOG released without fail. It is, in fact, the only thing in their lives at which they have not failed.

On the bright side, fully 3/4ths of the posts and sites will be almost entirely unintelligible, thanks to the rampant ignorance of their authors. You will be treated to a mauling of the English language on a level that, before the internet, could only be achieved by throwing a book into a wood chipper.

There are a few people (four, to be exact) who can legitimately use the defense that English is not their native language. The rest, however, can only blame themselves, having read nothing for the last ten years besides Harry Potter books and “you hit the oozing bandersnatch for 50 points of slashing damage!” What is genuinely terrifying is that many of these people really did graduate high school that stupid. Do you really think it’s a good idea to allow people this inept to pump gas?

Over time, you’ll begin to realize that every dickhead on the boards believes that he (and make no mistake, it’s always a “he”) is the only person alive who knows how to make your game “right”. But the real problem is not that they all think they know the solution; the problem is that they’re all alive.

“Fine,” you are thinking to yourself. “You’ve accurately and fully addressed the cause in all its sundry forms, but what are the effects?” That’s an easier question to answer. The effects are twofold:

First, the publishers read all this crap. Now let’s be honest, the publishers aren’t any smarter than the fuckwits writing this drivel, or they wouldn’t be working in publishing. So they see this overwhelming pressure from the screaming retar^H^H^H^H^H players to maintain the status quo, and it slowly dawns on them that every time something deviates from Everq^H^H^H^H^H the norm, the players squeal like pigs being slaughtered. So what do they conclude? “For God’s sake, don’t touch anything!” The result of this is out-and-out refusal to fund or even entertain any proposal whose title is not an anagram for “Everquest”, and nothing changes.

The second effect plants the genre suicide where it will work the most harm ­in the very offices of the developers themselves. They are the real victims here. Left to their own devices, they are more than smart enough to create a good game. But in addition to caving to pressure from the publishers, the developers commit the cardinal sin: they listen to the players. They see literally thousands of people whining about everything and suddenly, their faith in themselves is shaken. They don’t feel qualified to make rational decisions on their own. How could they possibly be smart enough to even consider, much less understand, all the effects of any one change? They can’t fathom making any sort of change without getting the permission of the players first. They’re terrified of the consequences of any attempt to do so. “What if they don’t like it?” they think. “We’ll have spent all this time and money for nothing!” So they do the only thing that seems safe: exactly what they did last time.

What are we left with? A bunch of sameish-looking, sameish-playing, sameish-sounding games that haven’t put forth an original fundamental design concept ever. Bullshit level schemes laying down artificial, ridiculously steep barriers to progress because after all, “what will we ever do if they’re able to see right away that we have no content?” Players who get pissed off when things don’t change, and even more pissed off when they do. Developers pulled in all directions, moving in none. And publishers insisting that the chicks’ breasts be made bigger. How fucking great for us.

If you read this far, you’re probably nodding to yourself in awe of the clarity I’ve bestowed upon this subject. Maybe you even laughed about “those stupid players” I described.

Well, news flash, jackass: I was talking about you. That’s right, you are the problem. So are all your pathetic “friends” online. And so are all the shitsticks in your “guild”. And all those dickheads on the message boards you troll every day of your miserable, worthless life. You are all responsible for making the MMOG genre suck. Do you want it to not suck any more? Here’s how you can help:

SHUT THE FUCK UP.

Keep all your “bright ideas”, all your “concerns”, and all your “thoughts” to yourself, dumbass, and for the good of humanity, cancel your internet service or just go kill yourself. Your parents would like their basement back.

"c05zr2f","&gt; You called him an idiot.

You're right - it's such a stretch from ""thinks he's great, isn't great, doesn't listen to anyone because he thinks he knows it all and gets completely owned in the end"" to ""idiot"". &lt;:-/

&gt; Which you used to characterize the kid as an idiot. That the kid talks back to the teacher does not make him an idiot, it probably makes him a smart 17 year old.

Disrupting a class, talking back and trying to put one over on your teacher means either you genuinely *are* better at the subject than they are (ie, you really know your stuff) or you have an exaggerated sense of your own self-worth.

The kid very obviously doesn't know anything like as much as his teacher, so he clearly has an exaggerated sense of his own self-worth (at least, as regards technical ability).

&gt; the teacher who, it seems, considers himself the crown of creation and the envy of all. And it seems that he can't take any back talk or other views.

Really?  *Really?*  The students are *there* to learn.  The teacher's got a disruptive pupil who doesn't listen, interrupts, refuses to concentrate on his work and actively tries to frustrate the teacher in his teaching efforts.

Eventually the teacher decides to play a joke on him to teach him a lesson, and in your mind it's the *teacher* who's the bad guy?  I'm not being funny, but how old are you?

&gt; Wow, a student, a 17 year old kid, was playing.  Yes, I got that.

No, you didn't.  A 17 year-old kid (nearly an adult) was screwing around *in class*.

If he wanted to screw off he could have stayed at home - if he attended the course he should pay attention, not prat about, talk back to the guy paid to teach him and disrupt the class for all the other students.

&gt; The response of an actual teacher is to try to teach the kid, not humiliate him.

Look, the kid was screwing off in class, disregarding his assigned work, disrupting the class for other pupils and actively trying to hamper the teacher in his teaching.

So eventually (instead of writing him up or throwing him out the class) his teacher decides to good-naturedly teach him a lesson.

Moreover, the kid obviously took it as intended, while *you're* getting all bent out of shape about it... when nobody got hurt and you weren't even there to see how it went down.

Moreover, the tactic obviously worked, because:

&gt;&gt; Pima has been a perfect gentleman since.  He even shows up to class five minutes early every day.

So... y'know... what's your point?

&gt; The student was playing, playing back is one thing, intentionally humiliating someone is just a sign of a insecure tin pot dictator.

So... what would have constituted ""playing back"", if not playing a good-natured joke on him?

&gt; When a teacher tries to humiliate a student it only shows the inability and insecurity of the teacher.

Wow - assume much?

The teacher didn't ""humiliate"" him - he played a joke.  A joke that was taken as such.  Nobody was humiliated, so there was no 
""humiliation"".  Where *do* you keep getting this idea from?

Also, instead of writing up the student, he played *a joke* - far from inability and insecurity this shows a relaxed, informal attitude and good nature.

&gt; It shows that the teacher is afraid of being shown up by the student rather than happy and proud of what the student knows.

No, it shows that if you attend a class, disrupt it for all your classmates, refuse to afford your teacher even the minimal respect of listening to him and concentrating on the assigned work and *then* try to make him look stupid and stop him from doing his job, you'd better hope the guy's got a sense of humour.

&gt; Clearly that professor does not actually expect anyone to learn something in the class.

Actually, he expects them to learn what he's supposed to teach them.  Someone who disrespects him, ignores and frustrates what he's trying to do and spoils it for the other classmates simply to fellate their own ego is lucky if they get away with a friendly, informal ""warning"" like this.",1224782511,"i'm not being funny, but how old are you?","funny, but how","funny","but",TRUE,"funny , but how old","old",NA,"how",1

This guy has done IT interviews, how fantastic.  I have done IT interviews, too, for an 800lb internet gorilla.

Here's a few tips on interviewing that aren't so boring that it makes you want to paint the wall with your brains:

* **Do** dominate the conversation.  It shows me that you've got the stones to not let me blather on about some self-important shit because I'm the one doing the interview.  Interviewers who get pissed when you take charge of the conversation are just worried that you'll be taking their jobs.  In reality, they're dead wood so they know it's coming.  It's just a matter of who and when.

* **Do** tell a joke.  Be funny but smart.  Talk some trash on PHP or any other technology you don't like.  A sense of humor is important.  Obviously, don't tell me a racist joke, but show me that you've got *some* personality.

* Dress code: have some knowledge of the company's culture.  When I worked at Google, you could always tell who the interviewees were because they wore a polo shirt and khakis.  Showing up for the interview in a t-shirt and jeans proved that you understood the culture.

* Profanity can be funny.  If you've got the balls, and the situation fits, do it.  This guy says that using profanity shows a lack of intelligence, to that, I say, *who the fuck are you, Jerry Falwell?*  Seriously, if your interviewer gets all stick-up-the-ass because you said ""bullshit"", then you probably don't want to work with the guy anyhow.  Fuck him if he can't take a joke.

* Have questions, but don't ask the same goddamned questions I hear every fucking interview.  *What's the food like?* *What do you do with your 20% time?*  Christ, I have the answers memorized as you do the questions.  Ask your interviewer what he *doesn't* like about the company.  If he can't come up with anything, he's full of shit.

"c02l1dm","Interesting, but in the real world there are more important considerations.   Computers are much less expensive than humans.

GC (by which I mean one like Java has, not reference counting - even though reference counting it a type of GC) allows programmers to spend less time thinking about memory.   This makes it easier to get something written faster.  However, once in a while you are bit by memory that won't (or shouldn't) be accessed anymore, but is reachable, and so the GC won't get rid of it. 

Manual memory magement is hard to get right.  However those who are doing manual memory management generally know it is hard so they get in the habbit of using tools to tell them what memory they forgot about.   Almost nobody can say raw speed is more important than the programmers time to get memory access right.

GC can be often be turned off (depends on the language/runtime) for time critical code, when time is not critical it will take care of clean up.   This allows GC languages to be faster for a short burst when speed really matters, so long as there is enough downtime overall that the GC can do the job.

GC does not take care of other resources such as file handles that still need to be cleaned up.  Taking care of this is just as hard as taking care of leaked memory, but there are typically many more memory allocations that resource allocations.

Reference counted GC allows RAII, which can (because it is generally done by the programmre not the runtime) also clean up other resources.   However the programmer needs to take care that they don't have any cycles - often a hard problem itself.  


I tend to lean to references counted GC as the best compromise, but it is just that: a compromise.  There are good and bad sides to all choices.   Generally the runtime speed differecnes are not important enough to be a factor in the decision of which to use.

"c1pquw","So how would tagging work?

People assign multiple tags to an item. Tags get voted on like story submission so that the top ten descriptors or top number beyond some relative vote threshold act as elements that can be filtered by rules. Then you indicate in your account rules like : Hide {picture, fark},  Show {picture, nasa}, ""Bask in the Glory of"" {comic, xkcd}.

Ultimately these rules will be augmented by profile relative  filters. Say your voting history has demonstrated that you like to see pictures, but only pictures that a sub-cluster of reddit users also like to see. If a random one of those guys up votes a picture that is sitting on a fuzzy rule barrier then it has a better chance of being seen under your rules. If one of those guys disapproves of the same picture then it has less of a chance. User declarative rules coupled with careful analysis of actual user behavior can go a long way to resolving this issue.

Tags are ultimately relative to users. User profiles may cluster around certain declared behaviors, but only by comparing this to actual behavior can reddit make good decisions. You and users closer to your own profile may agree that some pictures are cool and some are lame, but the degree of coolness and lameness that such a binary distinction makes may not be so closely aligned to what the user wants to say. Is it ""very cool"", ""kinda lame"", ""coolish"", ""funny but lame"", etc. In fact there is a good chance that there will be a cluster of users who feel the reverse of the way you have tagged stuff. Or there may be clusters who feel that both are cool or both are lame. Should these orthogonal views be denied legitimacy because they are out voted? What if they are outvoted by only a slim majority?

Hence the need for both declarative rules, which serve to show what a user ""thinks he is saying"", coupled with profile  analysis which give a picture of ""what the user actually does"". Together these can give a pretty good approximation of ""what a user actually wants"".",1178897033,"is it ""very cool"", ""kinda lame"", ""coolish"", ""funny but lame"", etc.","funny but lame","funny","but",FALSE,"funny but lame","lame",NA,NA,1
