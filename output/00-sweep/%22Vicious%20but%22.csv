"g3abo8t","Gotta say I respect both you and /u/ellethemermaid for being such fans... lol I thought I was a huge fan but I've only watched once through ü•∫ Although to be fair I was enraptured the whole time.

I think that the mark of great art is that it can be interpreted in countless different ways. So in my mind the coma-theory &gt;!(side note: why is it a theory when the finale pretty much says that's what happened?) !&lt;and the surface-level story are not mutually exclusive. The symbolism is just as relevant whether it's us the audience (aka ""Friend"") experiencing it, or whether Elliot is along for the ride. hmm kinda hard to put into words but it's like a fractal delusion. Are we creating a world in our mind based on the world created in the mind of Sam Esmail based on the world created in the mind of Elliot..etc you get the picture. No matter which level you chose to focus on, there is richness of meaning and storytelling. 

We could look at each character in the show as an aspect of Elliot's personality. Even the scummy people and deranged killers \_are\_ a part of Elliot. Some minor antagonists are owned and put away easily, indicating that  they don't have much sway over the ""real"" Elliot. 

But others play a huge role in his life: Tyrell, Vera, WhiteRose. The struggle with those characters symbolizes Elliots internal struggles with aspects of his personality. The Dark Army to me is the most interesting. While Vera is vicious but ultimately petty and driven by ego (i.e. Elliot's inner child throwing a temper-tantrum), the Dark Army is quite literally the ""Dark Side,"" terrific in power but utterly destructive if left unchecked.

The happy-go-lucky Elliot we meet near the end was naive an impotent. He needed Mastermind (maybe his ""shadow"" in Jungian theory) to give him the edge to face reality and fix a broken world. But that also opened a can 'o worms, because the logical evolution of the Mastermind Shadow is the tyrannical WhiteRose. Mastermind may have been able to make a deal with the Dark Army, but as the situation quickly grew out of his control, he needed Mr. Robot to save him... and save Elliot from becoming a WhiteRose.

"g2w0dde","Here are a few tips from my personal experience (after dying 15 times in 3 failed runs and succeeded with only 2 deaths in the following):

1.	Don‚Äôt rush. Rush burst is during bind. Watch the boss. 

2.	there are a few spots which are safe to stand, away from the claw machine bullshit - on the right : the spot below the first platform next to the claw machine (safe from whirlpool of time and claw machine), and second next platform after it. Likely under the intense animation and nervousness you‚Äôll be unable to see the claw machine movement unless you stop, so try maintaining at those spots.

3.	1H KO laser attack actually has a delay. The 999999 damage sometimes only comes in a second AFTER the loud chime of two clocks crash. If you cast iframe right when they pass, there are times you‚Äôll still take damage. 

4.	try to dodge Papulatus‚Äôs land crash attack. It‚Äôs not vicious but very annoying and can cost you a life when whirlpool is on. This is because when it does super knock back at you, you‚Äôll be basically ‚Äústunned‚Äù for a second. You won‚Äôt even have the split second to cast your iframe shall it knocked you right into the whirlpool. 

5.	 make use of Hero‚Äôs Will when he cast countdown seal to you, don‚Äôt bother to 2x the time. Right a second before the countdown ends, cast Hero‚Äôs Will, that way you‚Äôll be immune to his seal one time and that could save you a lot of time on DPSing.

6.	papulatus likes being a prick by casting a whole row of white ticking clock bomb which are undodgeable unless you went left and right. And most of the time the left and right adjacent to the bomb is also filled with bombs, so better to stop DPSing for the moment and walk around to dodge. 

7.	towards 30% HP left or so, if you have your burst ready, don‚Äôt cast it. Likely it‚Äôll coward up and go into recovery mode and you‚Äôll waste your DPS buff hitting stars to turn the clock. It‚Äôs best to get ready to burst and bind when you have removed most healing panels, leaving one ‚Äú0%‚Äù or final one where your needle is right on it, ready buff and remove the last to continue the fight.

"g2850jv","&gt; How nerdy are the characters

Out-of-universe the answer is ‚Äòvery, very nerdy‚Äô but that is inherent to their existence as magical creatures in a fantasy setting - such subject matter is almost universally treated as nerdy, at times even by the children such characters and stories are meant to appeal to.

The in-universe answer is ‚ÄòKinda‚Äô, as anyone as naive and blindly devoted to their own definition of good are often kind of huge nerds. You also have to consider that depending on an individuals perspective, each of the girls have hobbies others might consider nerdy or just plain weird. That‚Äôs okay though as that gives them character and, besides, as long as they are happy with their lives who cares if they are kind of nerdy?

"fzv380z","Most of what I'm saying comes from Antonia Fraser's book ""Marie Antoinette: The Journey."" I've read a number of other biographies but that one is vivid and (I think) raises interesting points. Fraser is more of a Marie Antoinette ""supporter"" so to speak. She makes the argument that Marie Antoinette was not vicious but young, naive, easily manipulated by older courtiers, and trying to play a role that she was not a good fit for, for both personal and political reasons. She also made the argument that Marie Antoinette built the Hameau not only because model villages were the fashion, but also for relief from the court etiquette of Versailles. Being stared at by thousands of people while you get dressed and eat every day can't be easy. I can see why a model village would almost be a respite. 

According to Antonia Fraser, Marie Antoinette's daughter was extremely spoiled by the court and by her father, and was a bit difficult as a result. Marie Antoinette tried to stop her from being quite so terrible by bringing in peasant playmates and making  Marie Therese give her toys away in charity. This upset Marie Therese so much that at one point, when Marie Antoinette was injured in a hunting accident, her daughter expressed resentment that her mother hadn't died. When she said this, a noblewoman was shocked and asked Marie Therese if she knew what that meant, and Marie Therese told her that it meant she would never have to see her mother again, and she was fine with that.

When they were arrested they were originally held in a damp older palace and Marie Therese complained about it. Marie Antoinette told her daughter that if Louis XIV had lived there comfortably, she shouldn't be complaining. 

By the time Louis XV was executed, mother and daughter were reportedly very close though (as one would hope). After reading this biography, I personally think Marie Antoinette would have been happy (in modern times) as a housewife and mother who volunteered at charity events, or maybe as a kindergarten teacher. She didn't have the personality needed to be a strong queen, especially at the time period in which she became queen, and that's not (entirely) her fault. 

Other biographies paint her as being more vicious, and you can make the argument that maybe she eventually did become that way, locked away in a place like Versailles.",1596204715,"she makes the argument that marie antoinette was not vicious but young, naive, easily manipulated by older courtiers, and trying to play a role that she was not a good fit for, for both personal and political reasons.","vicious but young","vicious","but",FALSE,"vicious but young","young",NA,NA,1

3. No. Stops murdering Ellie because she realises her main flaw, which is her blatant tribalism. Until then she saw the world in a very strong us vs them mentality. They were the good guys, the Scars were the bad lunatics. She and her father were a victim, Joel was a psychopath and murderer. The Fireflies at least had concrete goals which justified the means, the Scars are just doing wanton destruction. But then at that moment, when she looks at Lev, she understands that the person she's threatening to kill could easily have been Lev just two days ago, before she learned that the world isn't as black and white, and that she's only the protagonist of her own story and others are the protagonists of theirs. Up to that moment, Ellie and her friends were obvious psychopaths to her (she killed Joel for revenge and let them live, and then they go around killing all her friends and their dog, including the pregnant woman, and when she finds their hideout, she finds a series of pictures of her friends. That's what a serial killer looks like). So no, it was just because someone told her not to, when did that ever matter? She did things because she was convinced of them, always, throughout the entire game.

4. That's not true. She loses everyone and everything, except Lev. She loses her father and the Fireflies. And after seeking revenge and sparing two people, she loses actually all of her friends and anyone who mattered to her. Except Lev, that's the only person who remains. She didn't get away with it at all. Ellie merely lost Jesse after her first attempt at revenge. A person who as far as we know doesn't matter all that much. Ellie does NOT lose a person at every turn. That's just not true. Abby does though.

5. She's loyal, she cares a lot for her friends, but she's also incredibly tribalistic and while intelligent, she's single-minded and too emotionally invested in certain things. She has a caring nature for people in need, like Lev and Aya, that she was taught by her father.

Only because ammo is valuable and who knows when he'll find more?  

We don't get to see how Joel would react if offered a chance to avenge a family member.  The violence that we do see is vicious, but also cold and calculated.  He breaks Robert's arm for information, but when they have what they need, Tess puts Robert down with a bullet to the head.  He tortures David's men for information, but as soon as he has what he needs, he kills them both as quickly and efficiently as possible.  You get the option to hang around and get revenge on Tess's killers, but the game ""tells"" you to sneak away from them, jump into the next building over, and get out of there as quickly and quietly as possible.  

Now, it's entirely possible that seeing Ellie beaten to death in front of him would have pushed him into a beserker rage and led him to torture those responsible, but nothing like that happens in the game, though there were multiple points where, with some different storytelling decisions, it easily could have.

"fvqtndh","I'll use my setting **Dungeons and Centaurs** for this one, and assume the closest equivalents to the stereotypes -- so, I'll use a high elf, a mountain dwarf, a cave orc, and a northern human, since most of the focus in LOTR seems to be on Anglo/Germanic-ish human beings.

- Tolkien elves don't have direct/obvious magic spells, like telekinesis or fireballs, (AS FAR AS I KNOW, PLEASE DO CORRECT ME IF I AM WRONG) only the Istari do, so it's more likely that a high elf from my setting would win. Even worse, the high elf likely wouldn't take the fight seriously, toying with the Tolkien elf and wearing him down with illusion spells and magic blasts that do more weakening than flat out killing. Eventually, the Tolkien elf will most likely die from a knife to the throat, or a sudden elemental blast, most likely air or ice. If the Tolkien elf manages to rush at the high elf right away, the deadly spell may have to come more quickly.

- A Tolkien dwarf fighting a mountain dwarf would be a close call, seeing as how they're nearly identical (kind of the point, seeing as how the other kind of dwarves, deep dwarves, stray further from the usual expectations, preferring to use magic instead). I've noticed that Tolkien dwarves seem to prefer axes and swords over blunt weapons, so if the Tolkien dwarf does this, the mountain dwarf will most likely win, simply by using a warhammer or halberd or something to break through his armour.

- A Tolkien orc would likely die to a cave orc, since Tolkien orcs are small, weak, and they seem to be meant to represent a degenerated humanity, cruel and vicious, but cowardly and self-loathing. Cave orcs in my setting were specifically created by dark magic to serve as footsoldiers, similar to Tolkien orcs, but they're a bit stronger than humans, and about the same size, perhaps a bit smaller due to living underground. They're definitely very bloodthirsty and aggressive. I don't think this warrants much more explanation, it'd be like if a cave orc fought a standard fantasy goblin. An uruk-hai might have more of a fighting chance.

- Finally a Tolkien human vs a Northman from my world. The Northman would most likely win if he's got enchanted equipment, if not, it'd be closer to a draw, but the Northern humans in my world have their natural strength, height, stamina, etc a bit exaggerated, like in the Elder Scrolls.

Anyway, I would try again to see how it will actually play out. Obviously removing when blood is drawn, but regardless, another piggy is out there that might bond better and it's foolish to immediately say a dominant female will not bond with any other pig.

Hey there Pardner ;p

I don't think I've ever heard somebody ever say they miss classes before. I had to read that over a few times to make sure I was reading it right. Is the Headmistress holding you hostage? Are they making you say that? Blink twice if you need help. No, but seriously, I kind of understand what you mean about having a schedule. Not that I've ever really been somebody who uses a schedule, but you know, I can understand how having that structure can be nice. Like, you wake up on Thursday and you know exactly what you're getting into. During the summer? Anything goes, baby! Win the lottery or get hit by a truck, who knows? 

I've been picturing Mariachi turf wars in my head for awhile now. I can see them now, slowly circling each other. The music little more than shudder, like rattlesnake but you know, with a tuba. The sun reflecting on their glittery outfits, soon to be stained with the blood of their enemies. Somewhere, an eagle cries. A cloud of dust blows across the scene. And when the fighting starts? It's vicious but strangely high-tempo. Never will you hear a more cheerful apocalypse. Maybe you should make a Super-Band out of the survivors? Just spit-balling ideas.

I can agree that geese are probably worse than ducks. At the local park, the geese are spoken of in hushed whispers. The ducks remember them as myth, I think. I'm not looking forward to what would happen if the geese came back, while all of the duck gangs were fighting. Too busy shanking the backs of others to watch their own. Tragic. I'm sorry you had your evil gander encounter and that it still haunts you. I'm sending good vibes to help with that. 

The goose you drew looks like an asshole. Fuck that jerk. I bet he calls people shit like ""champ"" and ""boss"". He probably wears waaaaay too much cologne. I can guarantee that he doesn't tip, either. And I'd bet money that he talks loudly on his phone in a movie theater. What an asshole. 

Skateboarding is fun and it's not that hard! How are you on a broom? It's not, like, the same thing but you'd be surprised how reflexes and balance and stuff translates between them. If you ever wanted, I could give you some pointers if you wanted to give skating a shot. Either way, I bet you're super good at something I wish I could do. Like juggling. You seem like a juggler. I don't know why it is, but I bet you're old hat at the old three-ball-palm-shuffle. I don't know if that's a real juggling term, but it sounds cool. 

So the fish fountain...I mean, it's what the name implies. It's a fountain that looks like a fish. I took a picture of it and included it. You should find it in the envelope. If you don't, I guess the owl who delivered this stole it. But yeah, it's just a big ol' fish that spits water. I don't know why, but it makes me laugh. Like, it's his big, dumb expression I think. 

TV is...alright, I guess. Nothing new is on and I haven't had the patience to start anything new. I've got a few shows I want to watch but don't know where to start. Should I go with ""Storybook Apocalypse"", ""Caveman PI"", ""Dystopia"", or ""Satan's Kitchen""? I'm not going to give you any context but I'll let you choose what I watch and I'll keep you updated. You can live vicariously through me. And yes, before you ask, all of those shows are real. 

It's been forever since I listened to the radio. Well, muggle radio at least. I listened to wizard radio sometimes, since my roommate has a radio in our room. But I've never heard of...shows? On the radio? Like a radio drama or something? My curiosity is piqued. I'm imagining like, Mission Impossible or something but it's just a guy describing people fist-fighting in excruciating detail with shitty sound effects.

But yeah. Enough about me! Tell me more about you! Like, what sort of stuff do you like to do? What music are you into? How many bombs have you disarmed with 2 seconds left to go? How many sword fights have you been involved in? Anything!

Anyway, I should probably sign off for now. This already seems like a novel. Don't tell any of our teachers that I can write this much this fast, huh?

"ftl29g4","There are a lot of things about Columbus that are not as sickening as exposed. The author of the comic judges his humanity using current standards and then compare him with a contemporary ""Man of God"". Literally tagging Columbus as the Father of the Atlantic Slave Trade by some impossible to know consequence, the author shows his moral position against Columbus. Yes, he was ambitious, pigheaded and vicious, but it is too easy to just tag him like the origin of all trade of African and American people, including children. It is too rhetorical. 

True is that the round Earth idea was known between educated people, but Columbus had a more peculiar discussion with Spanish academics that had in several other courts. The discussion wasn't if the Earth was round or flat but how many weeks would take to get around Earth, or put in other terms, how big is our planet. Measurements were also already done, but they where astronomical measures. While it is true that others had been in America before, Columbus voyage was also a sort of scientific experiment that proof him wrong about the size of the Earth.

He knew most probably the Earth was bigger than he said it was but he was ambitious enough to sail anyway, fatally risking his crew's and his own life. That he was a terrible human being... that's true I guess... I just don't feel comfortable assuming that human beings should be all great beings.

"fpu93lh","It's fascinating to see the differences in psychology between bears. Black bears are smaller and can very well be threatened by larger animals (even humans with guns), so they've developed a propensity to be choose the flight option in most scenarios.

Brown bears are large and vicious, but still the land they travel on inhabits possible dangerous animals (think large moose or even other bears). So while they're normally fearless, sometimes they will get weirded out if animals try to fight back - which is exactly why survival guides say to fight back if you get into a brown bear situation.

Polar bears, on the other hand, are at the very top of the food chain in the arctic. There's literally no other land animal that can threaten a polar bear in their natural habitat. As such, instead of having a sense of fear, polar bears are either curious or vicious.

"fpr5wln","I don't know specifically about Fe *doms*, but I'll just talk about high Fe users, or Fe in general:

First off there's the obvious disclaimer that the function itself isn't inherently good or bad, but as for good and bad uses of Fe, I say this:

Good Fe: 

* Genuine concern and care towards other people, while not being pushy and understanding other people's limits and nuances. Fe is often stereotyped as shallow, but the Fe users I've known and had a good relationship with were very understanding people. 

* Good motivational/inspirational skills. I find that this is mostly the case for ExFJs, though. One of my friends is an ESFJ and he has great speech skills that are great at motivating large groups of people.

 
Bad Fe:

* More of an xNFJ thing than an xSFJ thing, but I find that some xNFJs (mostly INFJs) that are unhealthy can have some deeply disturbing beliefs all under the guise of a really invasive sort of ""we know best for everyone else"" guided by a clinical overusage of bloodshot Ti that often tend to undermine Fi completely. For example, the philosopher Sam Harris (INFJ) believes (through his Ti analysis) that morality can be objectively decided on (though it's still just his opinion, he says everything morality related should be weighed by it's relation to human and animal well-being) and be decided by science and that we should all collectively just ought to believe what science tells us and form a sort of creepy detached ""i LoVe YoU aLl"" society (seriously if his ideas hit the mainstream I'm going to become an anarchist or something). Then, there's two fictional examples (both also INFJs, those tend to be the main offenders here I guess), in Final Fantasy X (I'll spoiler tag it) &gt;!the villain Seymour believes all life is meaningless and that the act of living only ends up in misery in suffering, therefore he believes it's in the best interest for everyone to die since it's what releases them from suffering!&lt;, and in JoJo's Bizarre Adventure Part 6 &gt;!the villain Pucci ultimately acquires the ability to reset the entire universe, which he wants to use so that people can know what their predetermined fate is so that they can live in peace knowing that whatever they do is just going to happen and they shouldn't fight fate!&lt;.

* This is mostly a Fe dom thing, but manipulation can also be a really dangerous and nasty usage of Fe. Bad intentions + a silver tongue.

* Schadenfreude also seems to derive from Fe, the way I see it. Don't get me wrong, any type when unhealthy enough can be cruel and vicious, but to me it seems like unhealthy Fe users are the only ones who actively get pleasure from someone's *pain*. Unhealthy Fi-Te users are more likely to try and fight or get rid of whoever is in their way, but they're not focused on the actual suffering of their perceived enemy.",1588843553,"don't get me wrong, any type when unhealthy enough can be cruel and vicious, but to me it seems like unhealthy fe users are the only ones who actively get pleasure from someone's *pain*.","cruel and vicious","vicious",NA,FALSE,"cruel and vicious","cruel",NA,NA,0

"foroz13","The answers to these will depend somewhat on tone and level of ""realism"" vs. ""gonzo"" that your group enjoys and establishes.  In general, though:

**Scenario 1:** You might ask for a Defy Danger (with DEX or STR, I could see either one) to leap onto the chandelier and then onto the orc boss (the danger being: missing the jump, the chandelier breaking under the barbarian's weight, the boss seeing them coming, other orcs stabbing/shooting him as he does this, etc.).  

But, if you've already established a swashbuckling, ""fuck yeah!"" tone to the game, you could just call it a H&amp;S. It's just an elaborate way to attack a foe in melee.

In most of my games, I'd probably call for the Defy Danger first.

&amp;#x200B;

**Scenario 2:** yeah, I'd call that Defying Danger with quick thinking (+INT), for sure.  The danger is that the demons don't fall for it, or have better balance, or the wizard just trips or otherwise bungles the play.  

To be fair, I might also just say 'that's ridiculous and won't work... they're a horde of multi-limbed, clawed horrors and you're talking about spilling a pint of vegetable oil onto a porous surface.""  But, again--tone and previously established fiction matter a lot here.

&amp;#x200B;

**Scenario 3:**  kind of depends. Could be a Defy Danger with STR (the danger being that the strongman humiliates the barbarian). But... is that really true?

"fnnctny","As someone who worked as a Kennel Attendant for 1 year 9 months, I cannot tell you how *common* these situations are. So many of the ‚Äúaggressive and hopeless‚Äù dogs we had ended up just like this one. One big loving puppy.

For example our Animal Control Officers got a call for a loose aggressive pit bull. They went out with catch poles and protective gear, caught the poor guy, and brought him back to base for us to hold him to see if the owner would come looking for him. This dog was very aggressive and wouldn‚Äôt let anyone near himself or his cage without vicious growls and barking. I kept working on him for a long time and it seemed like he wouldn‚Äôt let up. So I took a chance and carefully (Don‚Äôt EVER try this at home or anywhere else as I‚Äôm a trained animal handler and had plenty of training and experience to fall back on) took a leash and managed to slip it on his neck while he was growling and barking. I then walked him out, with a considerable distance between us, to the doggy play area. I put him in the grassy area by himself and then shut the gate with me on the outside. 

I kid you not the dog broke free from the leash and started running, jumping, and rubbing on the grass. Playing with toys while his tongue was sticking out and having the time of his life. When I finally, and extremely carefully, worked up the courage to enter the enclosure with him, he basically ran up to me, jumped in my arms and started licking me while crying. 

This ‚Äúvicious‚Äù pit bull wasn‚Äôt vicious, but extremely scared and not used to freedom and toys and happiness. So when he got that and he saw me as the person who introduced those things to him he was the most happiest dog I‚Äôd ever seen in my life. He was super scared and aggressive with my coworkers for a long time and would only be loveable with me, but I worked to socialize him enough so that he fell in love with all the staff in our shelter. His name is Loki and he eventually found a forever home with people who adored him as much as he did them. All of us at the shelter cried because of how much we ended up loving and missing him.

Bottom line is that people are MONSTERS. Loki is just **one* of many cases that turned out exactly like this one. These animals aren‚Äôt born aggressive, people teach them to fear and hate and bite people. And the worst part is that if the shelter I worked at was High Kill, Loki would‚Äôve been considered a hopeless case and ended up being euthanized and put in a freezer instead of running around with plenty of toys and people running after him. It took time for him to understand freedom, kindness, and love and if you put the time and effort in you‚Äôll find them being completely different animals.",1587089447,"this ‚Äúvicious‚Äù pit bull wasn‚Äôt vicious, but extremely scared and not used to freedom and toys and happiness.","vicious, but extremely","vicious","but",TRUE,"vicious , but extremely scared","scared",NA,"extremely",1

Yes, chimps will bite your fingers off, so will humans, while also driving their thumbs in your eyes. Yes chimps will bite your testicles off, humans will rear back and use our vastly superior kicking force and kick a chimp square in the testicles too

Chimps are stronger than humans in some ways, and not in others. They are better at dragging things around and pulling apart trees, they are MUCH worse at throwing objects, throwing punches, and kicking.  

If you get in a grappling match, you are going to lose hard. If you pick up a rock and nail it in the face with a rock thrown as hard as you can and kick it in the testicles when it gets close, you'll do some serious damage. 

Jiu Jitsu isn't the best martial art for this, but joint locks will still work if he can get the chimp into one. 

This would be a pretty dangerous fight even if your roommate won, he's going to walk away bloody and missing fingers / with destroyed joints. 

I give the chimp 6/10 odds against him at least, just because Jiu Jitsu is really, really not a good idea against the chimp unless you can get it in a perfect joint lock and keep it from biting your hands off that are holding it.

Until I accused him, and then I saw that satisfied smirk of please they always talk about. When I accused him in the sideways way he did me, he would say - are you ready, ""I like when you say cryptic things. It pleases me."" And yet I stayed! 

But the threats, overt or not, should not be and are not forgiveable. Even if you subscribe to the theory that forgiveness is necessary, they should never, ever be forgotten. So you've done the most important thing which is to get away, to protect yourself emotionally as much as physically. 

The money may be a lost cause. Depending on how mush it is, it might be the price you pay for freedom.

You pay a HUGE price for any continued contact, for any reason. Sometimes it's unfortunately unavoidable: child support, shared custody, etc. There are ways of dealing with that altho it takes a lot of effort.

"ffuqpkg","I bet if you ask many of the worst haters wether they think the show is still worth watching, opinions will be split, with many saying yes.

But for many the end of a show has much more importance than any other random part. It's supposed to give closure and satisfaction, be the climax that ties everything together and makes you feel like all this time was well spent.

And especially the greatest fans became the greatest haters afterwards. Because they were disappointed, hurt, angry. They invested in the plot, loved the characters, speculated without end. And all just to see the whole thing go down the drain.

Also, you're giving the showrunners too much credit. Already in the 6th season they had to start making up their own material. And back then it was noticeably worse, but still actually good. And most people did cut them slack well into the 7th season and even accepted the first two episodes pf season 8 with openness and curiosity.

But what they did then goes beyond aimlessness or not knowing how to tie a story together on their own. It was downright stupid, in a way that only someone who doesn't think too deeply about what they are writing can do. Blunder after blunder with each episode, to the point where I can think of little they actually did *right* after the fourth one.

And we knew they weren't just talentless hacks with no clue of storytelling that got hired to a position they shouldn't have, because of how good the show was previously. Yes, they had source material, but did you actually read it? Because it is far from being a playbook or theater script. Among other things, it sticks to first person viewpoints with lots of internal thoughts and many scenes only being stuff that one person tells the other about. To go from those books to a show that is not only watchable, but as good as what we got initially requires actual work. And they were able to do all that in a stellar fashion.

So even if their overall knowledge of plot direction and big picture story telling was actual crap, it still shouldn't have resulted in the sad and inexcusable garbage that we got.

It is clear that they were not really trying to make it as good as they could. And some of their co-workers actually corroborate that. Not to mention that if they had had any real passion for what they were doing they would have been willing to take more HBO money in order to make more stuff. And don't tell me they couldn't possibly think of ideas, because they managed to simultaneously stuff the last season with slow filler while rushing through the plot in an unnaturally fast manner.

If they really didn't want to do it anymore, or just didn't want to give it their best anymore, they could have just as easily let someone else finish the job. There are plenty of above average fantasy shows around, all written by talented people. Yes, most don't reach the quality of the first few GoT seasons, but the quality of the latter seasons was often reached and even surpassed. But no, finishing GoT was too important to their resume.

On top of all that they actually had the temerity of giving interviews after each episode, in which they tried to give their thoughts as to why they wrote things as they did. And all of ot was amateurish and clueless at best, and downright insulting the intelligence of the fans at worst. I'm used to seeing creator/developer interviews or Q&amp;As and going from ""why would they do such a stupid thing"" to ""I disagree what they did and can imagine better, but I get where they're coming from"". With them it was the opposite. From ""I don't understand how they could do this"" to ""Fuck. I wish I hadn't known just how stupid their reasoning actually is. Now I lose hope for the next episode as well"".

So yes, people are toxic and vicious. But their goal isn't to destroy the reputation of the *show*. It's to destroy the reputation of the writers who decided to fuck their favorite TV show and be done with it as quickly as possible and with as little effort as possible because they wanted to work on other stuff but weren't humble enough to just do that then. May their Netflix deal burn to ashes and may they never work in story telling for entertainment again.

"fdp207p","Google 2 yo sleep regression. It‚Äôs a big thing, often affecting babies who were previously perfectly sleep-trained. There are many developmental reasons behind it. The hardest part is figuring out whether the kid is pushing boundaries and therefore requires strict consistency, or if she‚Äôs terrified/panicky/hysterical and requires reassurance. You say that she‚Äôs angry and vicious, but keep in mind that injured/scared animals act that way too. You‚Äôve received many excellent responses; here are some of my suggestions after reading through:

I think your routine is fine, timing-wise. At 2, kids should get 12-14 h of total sleep. You can forget about 14 because parents of those kids aren‚Äôt complaining. But 7 pm - 6 am plus a 1 to 1.5 h nap is perfectly reasonable. If you have to wake her up in the morning, she‚Äôs not getting enough sleep. All the websites about the 2 yo regression say not to give up on the nap prematurely. Keep up the habit of ‚Äúquiet time in your room‚Äù if the kid really won‚Äôt nap (doesn‚Äôt sound like yours is fighting naps, so all the more reason to keep it).

Try having one parent stay in her room in the dark for ~30 min at bed time. Just sit in one corner and use your phone with the screen pointing away from her. During the day time, tell your kid that you‚Äôll be trying this, but that you will leave if she screams or gets out of bed. This may help you guys get past this peak of separation anxiety. Reassure your wife that you may have to do this for 6 months or even a year, but once the kid gets over peak anxiety, you will be able to cut down the time commitment to 5 min. 2 steps forward, 1 step back; this is the 1 step back and if it works, it‚Äôs a lot smaller step back then screaming/fighting for 1-2 h and then letting her into your bed. If she wakes up in the middle of the night, you may have to choose between sitting with her again or letting her in your bed. Discuss with your wife, choose one and try to stick with it.

Dreams. Most sites say that nightmares start around this age. Kids may not have the imagination to have nightmares before that. The problem is, how do you explain to a toddler about bad dreams? We tend to assume that it doesn‚Äôt need to be explained, but maybe she‚Äôs screaming and fighting because in her limited experience, she lies down in bed and is teleported to different places/scenarios, some of them with monsters! Try your best to explain about dreams (movies in your head when you sleep, maybe?). Borrow/buy books about dreams to read to her.

"fdorcbi","&gt; These and many more are all such easy concepts and yet I failed so miserably to see them.

Bud, this is all shit that we figure out through experience. And usually we have to experience not getting it right the first time. Everything you've described seems really sincere and well intended. Learning that things don't always work out that way or that people aren't always what they seem is one of those shitty ""welcome to adulthood,"" moments that we all have to grow into and realize at one point or another. And it kinda sucks. Not knowing or assuming that that's how the world is doesn't make you a bad person. 

&gt; Though, to be fair, I have a brother who had been born when I was 14 and it'd been pretty usual for us to move each other's limbs around, so that may have added to my confusion, but still.

Seeing something innocent in something not innocent isn't something to be ashamed of. Further, seeing the sinister implications of something and gaining a larger view / understanding of the world is both important and, I think, a tiny tragedy. It doesn't make me happy to know that something really innocent / innocuous was turned into something more sinister for you. And yes, while it's important to be aware of this stuff and how it affect girls in particular, it's never fun or exciting to expose that to someone who hasn't seen it before. It's its own kind of brutality.

"fdh80c3","The standard answer would be ""That's not what Stoicism involves,"" but this is actually a criticism of Stoic thought that has been made before, e.g. by Martha Nussbaum: namely, that (a certain reading of) Stoic thought tends toward passivity and indifference (in the modern sense, not the technical Stoic meaning of the term) with respect to externals. So Stoic ""apatheia"" leads to ""apathy"" in the modern meaning of the term, which is presumably a kind of reductio of Stoic thought.

But most scholars who are sympathetic to Stoicism would deny that this is the case. The virtuous man *would* concern himself with externals: although they would be matters of moral indifference to him, there would be appropriate and inappropriate ways of using them, or failing to use them. But there remains the question as to *why* the Stoic should (or would) make use of externals in the first place.

Traditionally, Stoics would here appeal to cosmic teleology: everything in the cosmos has a purpose, and human beings have purposes to. These purposes are not (entirely) selected by human beings themselves, but instead are choice-independent facts, perhaps something along the lines of what would later be called 'natural law'. So, a man is obliged, when it is within his power of choice, to act according to what is naturally appropriate, and this would mean, e.g. serving his political community, having a family, cultivating his talents, etc.

Modern ethical theory, for the most part, tends to be critical of appeals to natural normativity and cosmic teleology (there are some notable exceptions, of course), so some modern scholars who want to resuscitate Stoic ethical thought, without the perceived baggage of Stoic metaphysics, will eschew the above kind of answer. Lawrence C. Becker, for instance, has a kind of constitutivist conception of practical reason: certain ends (e.g. having a family) become normatively important for us, because we select them or commit ourselves to them. Of course, we commit ourselves to some ends which we rank as most important, and other ends can support, conflict with, or stand independently of those most important ends. The role of Stoic practical reason, on Becker's view, is to integrate all of our ends into one, rationally optimal project.

The main problem, I think, with Becker's view, is just that it doesn't provide us with any normative foundation for the worthwhileness of any ends prior to our choosing. I suppose Becker would deny that there is any need for this, since we never are agents ""prior to"" the selection of certain values; we are, as a psychological fact, always already committed to some projects, so the question of justifying our concern for externals is a moot point. I find this answer dissatisfying, but I think it's a fair representation of Becker's view.

Anyway, as concerns your example, ""health"" is an external, therefore something morally indifferent for the Stoic. The sage as well as the fool could be unhealthy, just as much as the sage (or fool) could be wealthy. But there are nonetheless good *reasons* to be healthy. One might think that health is instrumentally valuable, because, when we are healthy, we are more able to achieve other ends which are important. Or one might think that health is intrinsically valuable, either because we are psychologically disposed to want to be healthy (what seems to be Becker's view) or because the optimal human form of life is healthy and this is our naturally ordained purpose (traditional Stoic teleology). The key point is that health is a matter of *moral* indifference: our *moral* assessment (what is truly good or bad) concerns only our character or agency, whether we are virtuous or vicious. But, clearly, the virtuous and vicious men will behave differently with respect to externals, such as health.",1578417364,"but, clearly, the virtuous and vicious men will behave differently with respect to externals, such as health.","virtuous and vicious","vicious",NA,FALSE,"virtuous and vicious","virtuous",NA,NA,0

"fcv0aqm","""Sheepdogs"" and ""wolves"" refers to the deeply fascist argument made in American Sniper (and, in a similar fashion, in Team America World Police). The sheepdogs are unpleasant. The sheep don't like them. But you need a sheepdog to protect the sheep from wolves, so their unpleasantness is preferable to being eaten. Similarly, military personnel and police argue that, yes, they're unpleasant and brutal and vicious, but it's better to have them around than to be left to the ""wolves"" (terrorists, criminals, etc).

It's a metaphor that exists solely for cops and soldiers to justify being sociopaths because ""what if there's someone worse than us, then what are you going to do"". The real answer is that the ""sheep"" can defend themselves just fine, thank you very much.

It's also not a particularly accurate metaphor because sheep love sheepdogs, i.e. dogs who live with the flock to protect them. What they don't like are *herding* dogs, who exist to terrify the sheep into compliance and do NOT protect the flock, which is a more accurate metaphor for the police.",1577992044,"similarly, military personnel and police argue that, yes, they're unpleasant and brutal and vicious, but it's better to have them around than to be left to the ""wolves"" (terrorists, criminals, etc).","brutal and vicious","vicious",NA,FALSE,"brutal and vicious","brutal",NA,NA,0

"f7dxdi5","The moon had risen thrice since I was bitten by that bald gorilla. The bite wasn't so bad, but the fever was severe enough that the alpha thought I was a goner and had to be exiled. Two pack-mates, no, ex-pack-mates, dragged me away and threw me into the nearest pit.

I laid there, awaiting my fate. But it never came. The sun was setting, and that was when I saw the bald gorillas coming.

I used the last bit of my strength to limp under a patch of bushes nearby. They fought my old pack. The alpha was strong and vicious, but she only bit one gorilla before three different sharp rocks broke her back.  By nightfall, the gorillas made a crushing victory. Through the moonless dark, I saw one of them, the one wearing a pack mate's skin on its groin, start tinkering with a chunk of wood.

It started a fire! I would have gawked at the miracle, but the same bald gorilla pointed the light at a blood trail. MY blood trail. I felt even colder than when I was bleeding out, but I no longer had the strength to move. So I closed my eyes, and waited for the sharp rock.

It never came.

Instead, I was picked up by arms warm and strong. Opening my eyes again, I saw four bald legs. My own legs. Somehow, I turned into a bald gorilla pup, or no, as realization hit me, a human baby.

&amp;#x200B;

Ten winters have passed. The new pack welcomed me, despite my differences.

It was a huge improvement over my old pack. When I had a fever again, the humans didn't exile me, but fed me some weird-smelling grass that actually made me feel better. In winters, they always shared their tamed fire and their stock of dry meat. As my human form grew, they even taught me their fire trick.

My wolf time were mostly spent as a loner in the wilderness. Sometimes I'd pick up a scent trail and lead the human pack to some prey. Sometimes whatever lingering kinship led me to the other wolves. But I kept getting rejected due to my human scent.

But tonight will be different. Moonless, I have my grown human form with a torch and a sharp rock. The wolf alpha I'll challenge won't stand a chance. I'll make a loincloth from its skin.

&amp;#x200B;

Eight more winters have passed. The human picked me up passed away and now I'm their pack alpha, or in their terms, tribe chieftain.

The tribe has expanded a lot once I recruited my entire wolf pack to search scent trails. That way, we caught way more preys than hunting alone. Last time we even killed a mammoth.

Now it's my turn to teach children the fire trick. Hey, you are supposed to use two chunks of wood, not a wood and a sharp rock. See, no fire. But wait, as I pick up the wooden side of the rock-stuck-to-wood thing, it feels much better as a weapon. Nice, I'll add this trick to my lessons.

&amp;#x200B;

How many years have passed again? Let me check the marks... right, it's been 73 years.

Ever since that day, I added more and more stuff to my teachings. The unchanging bright star I enjoyed howling to. Cycles of the sun, the moon, and the winter. Ways to leave marks on the cave, and ways to read them.

But now we got a new problem. Our tribe now has more people than the cave can hold. We need to figure something out.

That thought was interrupted by an ax to my back.

&amp;#x200B;

It's winter again, but outside the cave, I no longer have a way to track time.

I had been thoughtless. It was a tradition that dated back to my wolf days. The pack alpha must be prepared to face a challenge. I guess I lost my edge after so many years as a chieftain.

I thought I was a goner when I bled out from my ax wound. But I woke up again as a wolf amongst my kin. Turns out they threw my body to the wolves. What an end. Well, at least I got a new pack.

&amp;#x200B;

The wolf pack was moderately successful. Under my lead we were quite good at evading humans. And during winter months I could sneak into their city and buy food.

And today we had a good raid. An entire ranch of goats. The humans picked up a lot of new tricks after me, but my successor's descendants did eventually lose their edge as I did. But wait, I smell two not-goats.

The selection of most delicious preys my betas were presenting included two human boys. I felt another bit of lingering kinship, so I spared them. I could... feed them the right kind of milk once a month. They will be good recruits for the pack.

Around 2017 I saw it recommended in an AskReddit thread alongside several other stories I'd enjoyed, and the people discussing it mentioned that it actually got a *different* kind of dark after a few chapters.

"f5owzji","Ospreay &amp; Tana vs Golden Lovers on the 15/12/18 Road to Tokyo Dome is one of my favourite matches from 2018, and one of my favourite modern tag matches in general. 

Fantastic tag wrestling, despite neither of the four men really being a part of the regular tag division. The two feuds perfectly intersect, which Chris Charleton sums up beautifully at the start. The philosophical differences fuelling the bitter Tana and Omega storyline vs the vicious but respectful rivalry between Ospreay and Ibushi. The obvious Golden Lover storyline continuing as well as the mentor/successor relationship between Tana and Ospreay, which has been expanded on this year with Ospreay adopting Tanahashi's old ""Attack for the next generation"" slogan on his t-shirts. All in all a standout match which no one expected that close to Wrestle Kingdom.

"f3so2ps","I‚Äôm sorry for your pain. I‚Äôm sorry for your loneliness. You didn‚Äôt ask for your parents, you just slowly realized you were alive one day and they were them. And that was that. 

Count the days till your ready to get out of there. Save up. Get out. I don‚Äôt know what your plans for or what your background is, but get out and see the world as soon as possible. Now maybe 30 years ago, it be ‚Äúgo to college.‚Äù But you‚Äôll still be on their dime for the most part, still might have to come home for school Breaks. 

Instead maybe find some kind of work that can open more doors for you. Their are work exchange programs that allow you to move to other countries and work in fields like hospitality, and do a bit of traveling. The Military and coast guard are options too that have some real benefits and community support. Whatever you do, their is plenty of people in this world to make a family with. A family of bro‚Äôs, of friends, or even your own someday. Always look forward. Life is wasted on indecision and regret. Just keep moving on. 

I was so lost after college. Burnt out from 6 years in college and sort of ran away from it all to regroup. One day I just moved to New Zealand to try to find myself. I was exhausted of having to be the baby of the family, the boy friend, the life of the party, the idiot best friend, the this the that. None of them felt like me, and none of them could exist at the same time. All my accomplishments have felt undermined by my mom, because she facilitated them for me. Her dings were subtle and vicious. But in New Zealand, whole the work I ended up doing wasn‚Äôt what I set out to do, the opportunity was amazing. I found a companionship within myself that allowed me to learn to shine on my own,Because it‚Äôs just you and your reflection for most of your life. 

Whatever you end up doing, working and living on your own is a different kind of hard than the hopelessness one can feel stuck under the parental umbrella. But it‚Äôs a difficult life that makes you proud when the bills are paid. Makes you satisfied after a cooked meal. Makes you feel accomplished when the trash is taken out. Like fuck yeah, I take out my own trash, I clean my own dishes, my bathroom is spotless. I only have myself to blame for any mess. Once you‚Äôre on your own two feet, after some heavy sighs, some over due fuck yous and some other choice words you might need to let out into a pillow, you can start to heal and move past it. Once you get outside the area you grew up, you can see that the world is big enough and life is long enough to reinvent yourself. People focus more on who you are, rather than where you came from. You don‚Äôt have to be bound by them. 

100 years ago, you could move from New York to California and be forgotten. We live in a different time where everything is remembered, down to the dirty detail, but you can be the curator of your life‚Äôs narrative. This abandonment while your parents prioritized their digital life, doesn‚Äôt have to be your defining origin. It seems like you have learned how to support your self in many ways out of need. Most people who live in the real world like things clean, at least prefer it even if they don‚Äôt feel like cleaning. Don‚Äôt seek your self short or think of liking things clean as any thing other than an very appealing character trait. 

You may never come back to welcoming arms, even if you visit. They may not even know your gone until their are maggots in the sink. Let your absence be a wake up call to what the lost out on.

"f2vptba","I'm playing through Silver Snow now and some of the little touches present in this route are what got me thinking about Edelgard's loneliness in non-CF routes.

"f0uzlat","The album is good. Channeling more organic instruments to lead the tracks from a production standpoint really benefits the band so well. It's very alt-metal. It reminds me of I Prevail, BMTH's heavier cuts from both Amo and That's The Spirit, and definitely Nothing More. Heavy production still prevails on the album but the bite from the drop tuned guitars recorded in stereo is so sexy I wanna mosh whenever it comes to the forefront of a song. Manifest is their best song ever written. It's as good as it could possibly be. It's vicious but catchy, almost has an imagine Dragons feel to it in the verses. Where The Sky Ends, Stratosphere, Telekinetic, Flatline also stand out. I especially love that intro to Telekinetic, I feel a lot of Korn vibe there before the verse kicks in and relaxes the tension. I think the band needs to lean less into the electronics and feature their musicianship more because while the production tricks are cool they tire and keep some songs from feeling grounded for me and I know other folks feel the same way. Having the roots in acoustic instruments is simply cannot be overcome. You can sample and emulate all you want but we haven't bested the real thing with electronics yet. Even the tenuous orchestral arrangements that sound like every Sci fi movie score ever made can wear on me. It's not always tastefully done and that is something I hope the band considers relaxing going forward. You can still have your concept but use it as a supporting element instead of allowing it to always be the lead. Best example I can think of to illustrate this point is Bring Me The Horizon's ""Beautiful Life"" which uses a huge horn section to lift the chorus as the song progresses and eventually leans into it for a brief moment. Macklemore's ""Can't Hold Us"" and a similar horn ensemble that accents the song toward its middle-end. Life in a simulate is fun for a bit but eventually you want the real thing.

"f05dcg9","&gt; The S2000 is knifed edged, unforgiving, hardcore. 

Corvette driver here. This is how I would describe my C5Z.

Not insulting the S2000 here, but how can a little light car with no power like this be unforgiving? Could you please elaborate on this?

For reference, I had the chance of trying a BRZ on the track, and a turbo NB miata on the street.

&amp;#x200B;

The BRZ was amongst the least inspiring sport car I have ever driven. Its main advantage is also its drawback. It's too easy to drive. This thing is so well balanced (slight understeer) and so underpowered it's basically impossible to crash. You keep your pedal to the floor, aim where you want it and that's it. Sure, you have to be a bit careful on the apex when you trail brake, but really, it's no big deal. It drove like someone who had musical talent, but no interest and was just doing what he was told with no soul in it.

Despite its lack of soul (and extreme lack of power), I'll give to the BRZ that it has fantastic controls. Everything is crisp and amazingly responsive.

&amp;#x200B;

The Miata was (fortunately) turbo, with a coilover and stickyish tires, so I can't talk about the stock form, but if I remember correctly, it was pushing something like 8-10 pound of boost. It made what felt like 250\~hp, which was absolutely perfect for this package. It was very easy to drive. It was a bit tail happy (not on power, but just that the car was naturally oversteering) but very easy to handle while sliding. It felt like a happy car that just wanted to take you for a fun ride.

&amp;#x200B;

The Corvette is something else. It commands a good driver and a lot of respect. At first, it builds your confidence because of its insane amount of grip. Then, when you reach about 80% of the limit, things start to drastically change. The car is very stable, but once something loses grip, its over. And while the car has enormous amount of grip, it is not very nimble, so weight transfer and smoothness become extremely important. You have then to plan ahead, listen to the suspension and predict how the car will behave. From there, the car becomes a vicious, but ultra-hot girlfriend. Always teasing you to go just a little faster, and a little faster until you spin it.

It is just flat out amazing. This thing is fucking ferocious. It wants to win, it want to be the fastest. It is RAW, unrefined and mighty. It spits in the face of the refined Porsches, fancy mercedes and cool BMW with anger and pride, showing them that regardless how big your wallet is, the big dick always get the chicks.

Back in like 2004ish me and 3 of my friends were leaving the Italian feast in little Italy and apparently Mother Nature wanted to be a dick today because that night suddenly became the first official day of fall apparently and none of us were dressed for anything other than summertime weather so we needed to catch a cab that could take us to Brooklyn asap. 

Cabs were stopping left and right for literally everyone but us for the next 20 minutes nonstop. they were just lining up left right and center for everyone but us. It never even occurred to us that our skin color had something to do with it until we were basically the only people left on the fucking block. We thought maybe it was cuz a cab driver didn‚Äôt feel safe picking up 4 people at once so we took shifts trying to hail down a cab in smaller groups, freezing to death the whole time. Yeah we could have taken the train but at this point it was a matter of pride, we were invested, we‚Äôve already waited like a half hour, they‚Äôd have to stop for us eventually right? This is Manhattan not 1950s Birmingham so there we stood. First in pairs of least tired to most tire, then changed the color combination of people standing to see if we got better results (we‚Äôre all Dominican btw but representing every shade of dark Dominicans come in. black as fuck, brown as fuck, high yellow as fuck and me, light skinned as fuck? I dunno, wateva Lol) so it‚Äôd be like, 1 dark 1 light, 2 lightest together, just me, just the dark, 3 minus the darkest, it was like racist musical chairs, we couldn‚Äôt figure this shit out.

anyway after like another full fucking hour of seeing cabs blatantly fly by us to pick up white people either 3 feet ahead of us or 3 feet behind us, even if we waived them down first, we just decided to bite the bullet and walk to a train station when some random young white dude in what to this day are the tightest pants I‚Äôve ever seen on anyone ever in the existence of pants or people, notices our plight and was like ‚Äúhey you guys need a cab?‚Äù and before we could even respond he just halfway sticks his hand in the air and I swear to god if I wasn‚Äôt there I wouldn‚Äôt have believed it, 2 fucking cabs back to back both slam the brakes damn near to pull over and pick up this non threatening white dude. it was like he pulled these yellow cab assholes from the ether, We all screamed ‚ÄúAre you fucking kidding me?!‚Äù at the same time before thanking the dude and pretending like I notice the cab drivers face just shift into something slightly less jovial.

It‚Äôs funny now but back then at the time that was the most uncomfortably silent cab ride I‚Äôve ever been in. we just sat there in a quiet rage, one of my boys I especially couldn‚Äôt believe was quiet because he‚Äôs usually the guy who starts shit from nothing just a perpetual chip on his shoulder but today, nothing, just silence.

"ezwjvm0","I feel like Grindewald was maybe a more creative and inventive magic user. Voldemort didn't really come up with much, he was just willing to do whatever it took to gain power/immortality.

"ezaqukz","Pretty much, yeah. For my wedding, I wanted to look like me, so in photos I look kind of underdone. For my sister in law's wedding, she wanted the photos to look flawless, so in selfies and in person I looked like a total cakeface. (Also it was airbrush so, like, grain of salt there.) Falsies look insane in person but just make you look like you have lashes at all in photos. Flash will pick up ALL your shininess and throw it right back into the camera and make you look like you rubbed french fries on your face. Blush that looks natural on camera is *intense* in person; blush that looks good in person disappears on camera.

There's a lot of reasons for this but the biggest reason from this is distance from the viewer to the subject. When you put on makeup or take a selfie, your viewing distance is something like 2 feet at most. Most shots taken for a wedding are something like ten times that. You can't notice powderiness at that distance, but you can notice shine because it captures flash and throws it back. Stage makeup is also very, very heavy for the same reason; an audience 15+ feet away needs to see that Annie's cheeks are *rosy* which means, up close, she looks a hot mess.

Furthermore, from a technology angle, the camera is making lots of choices that get locked in the moment the shutter clicks. It captures pixels based on aperture, f-stop, etc based on the current lighting; editing lets the photographer decide what ""white"" is and what ""black"" looks like in that particular shot, which changes colors and tones and textures a lot, especially if the bride or anyone in the party has the tendency to get flushed when they're excited. Skin tones in particular are difficult to capture &amp; edit faithfully and flash is vicious but necessary.

This can be as small as someone talking to you about things you clearly have no interest in or as big as cutting contact with someone who doesn't respect you for who you are.

"eu9pufc","A small note:

&gt;To be clear, I'm not asking about the psychology in question.

Just to be clear, you ask several questions, some of which are indeed psychological. For example, whether mental conditions can be such that they make one's dispositions immutable. Given what we know, it's unlikely we'll ever find an actual person with dispositions like what you're describing, but it's a distant possibility.

Considering the other, more core questions:

&gt;I don't know what to think about cases like these. They force me to accept one of two things: that some people are inherently bad, or that there's nothing morally wrong with his behaviors.

As I understand the dichotomy you present here, you're saying that either their viciousness is an essential property of them, or their actions aren't irrational for those actions to be indicative of viciousness in the first place. There are a few things worth pointing out here.

We should get a good sense of what you mean by 'inherent.' If you just mean it's essential such that if they lacked the properties that constitute their viciousness, they would not be the same object. Taken this way, it's unclear why *non-essential* viciousness is a non-starter here. We can hold that they could be the same person even if they weren't vicious as such. 

Perhaps you don't mean *essential* by 'inherent,' and you're trying to talk about something like intrinsicality, where they are vicious in virtue of their own traits and properties, and not in virtue of their relationship with anyone else or anything like that. In that case, I don't see what work the qualifier is doing. By the very nature of the concept, presumably all people who have vicious, virtuous, or other moral characters have them in virtue of their own traits and properties.

Probably the most plausible reading is something like this. Someone is inherently bad if, considering only the closest possibilities, it is impossible for them to not be bad. So, all the objects that lack those properties are certainly not them.

But now, it still appears as though there are other options. The case described can simply entail that some people are vicious, but many of the closest possibilities still have them being not vicious. That's my own evaluation of the case described with the little information I've been given, and so I don't see anything that's sufficient to conclude either that some people are inherently bad or that there's nothing morally wrong with these behaviors.

I don't think this matters too much though. Understanding 'inherently' as the third way I described it, it's pretty clear that a lot of people are like this. But I know this from very different cases from the one described. In this case, if his behavior does indicate vicious character, it very much does seem like his character can improve because we're given a pretty crucial datum here: his *behavior* has improved. There do exist cases though where someone chipping away at enough of their viciousness is simply too distant a possibility.

As an interesting and relevant tangent, research suggests the same of those who experience sociopathy. Not only can we improve the behavior of those who experience it, our research suggests that we have the means to improve their character and motivations as well.

There are other things the dichotomy doesn't capture either. His actions could be wrong and yet don't imply viciousness, thereby making it false that we are forced to accept that either his behavior isn't wrong or that some people are inherently vicious.

Pedal Pushers is easy walking distance from the Golden stop on the light rail, so that's your best bet unless you happen to have another bike with you. 

You'll have a lot of good trails to choose from once you start. Apex is the closest, and is a front range classic.

One evening at Maximilian's House close to the Merchant district, the young student sat on his desk, to read and learn and taking notes for his Homework of his Law-School. Cool wind blew through the small open window he left always open at this late hour, like Skial asked or nicely ordered him to do or her devious god would send its wrath upon him if he not obeys. Max wasn¬¥t sure what to feel about the Skaven girl anymore. Sure there was ALWAYS the huge respect towards her like he sat in a cage of a devious animal that would kill him by instant if it he just would make a wrong move. But no matter what good he did, like living his life like she never had ever existed and not spreading a word about her existence or harming her, she never threatens his life since the day they were in that one dark alley where he fell for her charme. Of course to her sinister nature she loved to surprise and pounce and scare him to death, but with a playful affection he became used to it. But also his affection towards her had grown over the time they had spent together. It was not love for sure, at least he thought it was. But indirectly, his desires were only for her. There were a handful of pretty and desirable girls in this town he lives, showing interest in Maximilian, but the boy did not in return. For him, they shared nothing that amazed or fascinated him compared to the rat woman. They were just like him, just a human. Something he grew bored of. His desire for lust and pleasure he only wanted to share with Skial, an non-human creature. She may had a body close to a human, but her animistic features were what amazed the young student the most.
He was about to finish to write down a note as suddenly a silent rustle of cloth was to hear to his right and in the corner of his eye a dark figure sat on the wooden frame of the window. ""Skial?"" he asked in a almost whispering tone, with a hint of joy as two red little eyes glared at him in the shine of his candle. The Skaven didn¬¥t say anything and in a fluid move, she was behind the boys back, her arms fold around his neck and shoulders and her hands rest on his chest with her claws dug into the fine fabric of his cloths. The boy smiled in her presence and felt her muzzle digging through his lush and nice smelling hair as she did so often. ""What can i do for you tonight, my dear in all honor."" he asked more calmly as he actually used to with the sense of fear. But tonight he was in a good mood. He let his head rest against her soft body, he could feel the soft flesh of her breasts bound in leather against his head and feel her fur tickle at his back of his neck. ""Nothing-nothing for me"" she said as quiet as he did. ""Then why are you here-"" Max was about to ask, but he didn¬¥t need an answer anymore as Skials hand on his chest moved down south under his pants, the claws of her other hand caressing his neck without to scratch him and he felt her cold nose touch his cheek on his left, how her lips part and wet tongue licks across his skin. He even could feel her incisors scratch his skin slightly. He let out a soft groan in pleasure as she teased him. Was it her time again like in the Alley?
His Body was hot and sweating and it all felt as he was always almost about to climax by all the sensation. And it took not long until he came, moaning in ecstacy. All this sensation went on what like felt for hours, his dim and dazed vision blacked out many times, like he was closing his eyes in a extreme slow pace. He came again and again, lost counting under the effect of this drug she used on him, not that he even cared to count anything and just melted in the overflow of his senses until he completely blacked out some time later.
It was late in the morning as Maximilian woke up all the sudden. By the look at the ceiling, he was still in his room. A cold wind let him realize he was naked. His whole body was aching and some body parts felt so sore, like he had the longest walk in his life. With a pained groan, he looked for his glasses and found them next to him, not to remember he had put them off. To his surprise and shock, each lens had an ugly crack as he had put them on his nose. He got up a little and looked down on his body, just to realize in more bigger shock that he was covered in scars and scratches and some bruise all over his entire body. He smelled sweaty, not just his own sweat he could smell. -What in all the might of the Emperor did this Rat to me last night?- he was wondering very puzzled and fell back on the bed. He could not remember anything except the indescribable pleasure and lust he felt during the whole time. For his luck at last, to day was no school, otherwise he would have been in great trouble.

What actually happend, outside Maximilian's drugged mind was, Skial had brought him down to a smal secret hideout with few of her skaven sisters, where the girls had the pleasure to mate with him under the influence of Skial's drugs. Skial shared this young breeder with her sisters and they took turn on him wildly and unrestrained for hours until every one of them were sated. For him, it was all just Skial. All the sensations he felt were all more than he could have imagined. The feeling of flying or floating were Skial carrying him down to their little hideout. The fuzzy feeling on his skin was the touch of fur, the soft rags he was embedded and the touch of other skaven girls, rubbing and caressing the boy all over his body, mounting and riding him one after another and let this orgy last on for hours until they boy fell asleep, exhausted after mating with vicious but beautiful creatures.",1562718480,"the fuzzy feeling on his skin was the touch of fur, the soft rags he was embedded and the touch of other skaven girls, rubbing and caressing the boy all over his body, mounting and riding him one after another and let this orgy last on for hours until they boy fell asleep, exhausted after mating with vicious but beautiful creatures.","vicious but beautiful","vicious","but",FALSE,"vicious but beautiful","beautiful",NA,NA,1

Though I actually got the impression that he knows, after absorbing the Dark Soul, that he was not up to the task of being it's vessel. I think when we find him he has accepted the fact that he cannot fulfill his purpose, but instead of falling into despair and immediately succumbing to the souls that are tearing him apart, he holds it all together by sheer force of will so that he might find someone who CAN be the bearer of all the souls he's accumulated over the ages.

The first phase of this fight is just him convincing himself that we are capable of carrying out his will. Once we kill him, he knows we will have nothing left to us but to take the final soul and remake the world. So, barely holding onto his mind and his humanity, already twisted by the weight of his burden, he pushes us. Leaking the mad and restless souls he carries within him, he fights us with all he has. He can't end his struggle unless he is defeated honestly.

So the start of the next phase is him accepting that his part is over and that we can indeed carry on his task.

I managed to find the book that I was talking about (by some incredible miracle). If anyone is curious it's called *The Free Will Delusion: How We Settled for the Illusion of Morality* (2015) by James B. Miles. It's an interesting read.

Excerpt from the book I (barely) managed to misremember:

*""The problem of moral luck, and the problem of blame and moral responsibility in a world that reduces to nothing more than biology and environment, is spelled out by the philosopher Bruce Waller. Suppose, says Waller (2015), that we have a best friend John, who is warm, friendly, loving, kind, and virtuous: a credit to our species and a joy to all who know him. Unfortunately a mad scientist ‚Äì mad scientists are particularly common in philosophical thought experiments ‚Äì deliberately drips a nasty chemical compound into John‚Äôs morning coffee one fine sunny Tuesday, which immediately and irreversibly transforms John into a violent and vicious (but still rational and even reflective) person.
In that case, says Waller, most of us would say that John has now become a vicious and awful person, and we would take steps to protect ourselves from his cruel behavior. But we would not, upon reflection, blame our former best friend for his new vile personality, which had been capriciously ‚Äì and through no fault of John‚Äôs ‚Äì forced upon him. We would feel for John‚Äôs desperate misfortune, for his wife and children, and thank our lucky stars that the mad scientist hadn‚Äôt just as whimsically chosen us for his bonkers intervention. We would agree that John was now a morally bad person, says Waller, but most of us (though not all) would probably agree that we couldn‚Äôt blame John for his new personality and the acts that now directly arise from it ‚Äì and certainly we wouldn‚Äôt cruelly seek to make him suffer for what was already his great and sad misfortune. We would want him safely incarcerated, sure, but we wouldn‚Äôt consider taking satisfaction from his incarceration, and might even consider it obscene to take pleasure at the thought of his future suffering. But the point, of course, is that in a universe that reduces to biology and environment, everyone we do blame has no more chosen their vile personality than John had after his transformation by the mad scientist.

If a 200+ pound man wants to hurt you, there‚Äôs very few things you can do to protect yourself. There have been many female MMA fighters that have spoken about this too. If a guy that size punched them once, it would be over‚Äîaccording to them. 

Weight classes exist in fighting sports for a reason

Saying this, the whole point is to strike first and make sure not to get hit. Groin attacks rarely work as a first strike. It‚Äôs much better to hit them in throat or stab them in the eyes. If they grab you, bite as hard as you can and stat clawing at the face. It might sound primitive and vicious but this is your life. You do what you have to do to defend yourself and doing the dirtiest fight moves 

You should also always have a weapon like a knife next your bed where you sleep or other accessible areas that you only know of. Be strategic with regards to placement. When you‚Äôre out and about the city, make sure to carry pepper spray with you and always have a sharp object attached to your keychain (like a fake key that serves as a shank 

It‚Äôs not impossible to defend yourself but you have to be strategic (played out every scenario in your head before a situation like that arises), you have to be quick to react, and you have to be willing to play dirty 

Always try words. ‚ÄúPlease I am X years old, I have children and a family‚Äù

Learning Krav Maga or jui-jitsu to learn how to protect yourself from a guard position (on your back with attacker crouching over you) can save your life.

"en0p8ww","*Roman cultural attitude towards war/peace* and *socio-political integration.*

- Rome (mainly Republican Rome - the Principate still upheld this mantra but to a lesser extent) is unique in the ancient world for its extremely heavy handed approach to matters relating war and peace. All societies of the ancient world knew near endemic violence and a great many of them were warrior societies with a strong martial ethos. Still Rome takes up a unique spot in that it refused to accept victory on terms other than *submission of the opponent*. The very linguistic meaning of latin terms like pax and iustitia were used in a very different - ‚Äòdarker‚Äô from our modern point of view - context. Peace could only be made between a victor and a foe beaten into submission, pleading on his knees for mercy. This was the Roman ideal that kept them pushing harder in conflicts, that was the direct root of their tendency to ‚Äúescalate‚Äù wars rather than seek a settlement. 

And yes, Rome/Romans was/were very capable of making such settlements when events forced them, whether due to extreme pressure (First Macedonian War when Hannibal had the Republic hard pressed and they agreed to negotiate with Philip V) or due to selfish desires born from the ever raging competition amongst the Senatorial class for more *auctoritas* (often seen in making quick - even disadvantageous - peace settlements to end wars before ones political term ended and one would be replaced by another (pro)consul during war for example). Yet while such instances were not uncommon, they were unilaterally disdained. Such treaties were almost always broken by the Senate (such as after the Caudine Forks during the Samnite Wars and the 139 BCE defeat at Numantia - in both cases legions were humiliated, their lives spared in return for a peace treaty, the treaties rejected by the Senate and the respective consuls were sent back to the enemy to with as they pleased - they were both spared at that) who viewed them as highly un-Roman.

It was this mindset, this broad cultural attidude of Roman society that allowed them to persist in conflicts that other states would have ended years if not decades ago. The Second Samnite War, the War with Pyrrhus, the First and Second Punic Wars, the Wars against Numantia and a whole host of intermittent conflicts were marked by staggering Roman losses. Legions after legions were routed, defeated with some of the all time low points of Roman fortune such at Cannae. 

Literally any other contemporary state would have folded against such odds. And every other state expected the Romans to do so. Pyrrhus for all his wit and genius never quite understood *why* Rome did not capitulate after successive defeats, Hannibal tried and ultimately failed as well, despite delivering even bigger setbacks to the Republic. But the Roman society/elite rallied and pressed on. Beat 2 legions? 2 more will take its place. Sink a fleet at Drepana, killing up to 1/5th of the lower class citizens of Rome on one go? We built another fleet! It was in those darkest moments of defeat that the Roman tenacity outshone everyone, and in no small deal carried the Italian city-state to become the empire it did.

In light of the above it may be noted that two other characteristics of Roman culture stand out, that underlay/shaped the aforementioned and/or were linked to it.

- The first is one that is pivotal for the ‚Äòhow/why could they‚Äô - as a society - carry on wars were others would throw in the towel. Here the Romans also showed a unique cultural trait, in their willingness to absorb outsiders into the Roman fold. Unlike many other states building empires - think of Athens - the early Romans absorbed many of their former foes into their ranks. And perhaps counterintuitively - due to hindsight - this *was not a good thing* for those affected. Societies with generation old traditions were suddenly forced to repudiate their past and accept that they were now Romans at the beck and call of the Senate. Through such methods of (forcible) integration Rome during the 4-3rd century BCE would incorporate broad stretches of Italy into her corelands, creating a sturdy basis from which they would go on to conquer the entire peninsula and ultimately the whole Mediterranean. Again contrast these attitudes with how the Athenians would treat any outsider as second class citizens. When Athens fell her ‚Äòallies‚Äô/subjects of the Delian League did not rally to her. When Hannibal however repeatedly destroyed the Roman legions the fruits of this policy showed itself in earnest: while newly conquered lands tended to secede, the core Roman lands never showed any serious signs of defection and allowed Rome to wither the storm that would have brought any other state to its knees. 

The Roman tendency to escalate wars could not be without the adequate demographic potential to carry on conflicts and the that potential could not have been without the willingness to expand the franchise of Roman citizenry - a process that in any case would only fully be finished after the Social Wars.

 - Lastly, we have the highly self-centered attitude of the Republican Roman elites that saw Rome as the only valid place in the world, the only political unit *that mattered*. This is especially visible after the Second Punic War when Roman policy carried it eastward and individual senators were alloted the honours of kings - and in turn, they viewed them equals or above any such figures, as displayed in their behaviour towards the luckless Makedonian Successor monarchs such as Philips V, Perseus, Antiochus III or Antiochus IV Epiphanes. Their highhanded innate sense of superiority was hugely strenghtened by their actual succes but the *mores* of this attitude is already seen in the (possibly mythical) story of *Coriolanus*. The figure of ‚Äòthe exile at court‚Äô, so well known in the Hellenistic world - waiting for a foreign monarch to install him back as rightful king - was not something a Roman would stoop to - the tale of Coriolanus is a moralising parable about this. Roman politics were hard and vicious, but up untill the final bout of civil wars, this did not escalate into the intrigues as had unfolded at the Successor courts of the Hellenistic world. Scipio Africanus did not seek foreign aid after being thwarted by the Senate but retired from political life on his estates. Even those in direct opposition to Rome like Sertorius, did not do so as foreign agents but with the attitude of - and acting as - Roman senators doing what they thought was right for the Republic.",1557497071,"roman politics were hard and vicious, but up untill the final bout of civil wars, this did not escalate into the intrigues as had unfolded at the successor courts of the hellenistic world.","hard and vicious","vicious",NA,FALSE,"hard and vicious","hard",NA,NA,0

"ely89x5","Publius gave firm nod as well, already turning away from the polished bar.  The Colonel seemed unperturbed by the abrupt departure, merely raising his glass to the two Inquisitors before turning away.  Jurel fought to suppress a tic of annoyance, but knew far better than to even look like she was delaying or obstructing officers of the Ordos.  Instead, she muttered a polite acknowledgement and faded back into the crowd.  Everill took advantage of the brief respite to guide the Inquisitors through the house and through a series of corridors.  The trio passed through empty salons and galleries before slipping into the serving halls that ran through the mansion.  Eventually they came to the manor's kitchens, a huge affair easily the size of a smaller house in and of itself.  The staff was working with conspicuous care and efficiency, but a simple glance over their workspace showed that they were keeping far away from a large freezer-room in the back of the kitchens.  

Everill led the Inquisitors towards it, typing a six digit code into a keypad beside the heavy iron door.  The portal released with a hiss of cold air and a puff of frost, and no small numbers of the kitchen staff made the sign of the Aquila as they saw where the trio were going.  Something about the corpse held in deep freeze scared them.  As Publius and Allin made their way inside, they quickly saw why.  

The body rested on a sterile slab in the middle of the freezer, zipped tightly within a transparent body bag.  The corpse was still clad in the remnants of the hunting attire that it had been wearing when it died- Everill had not been lying about preserving the evidence as best as he could.  The deceased groundskeeper had been savaged as if by a wild animal, his face, right leg, and the right side of his body carved and torn in what appeared to be a frenzy.  It was precisely the sort of injury that a cursory observer might dismiss as the attack of a predatory beast, yet something was amiss.  The wounds were deep and vicious, but they were also remarkably clean, made as if by knives rather than by jagged claws and teeth.  Each one was also remarkably precise, cutting into key vital portions of the unfortunate victim's anatomy rather than randomly inflicted.  

Publius looked over at Allin, his face stern and thoughtful.  ""This wasn't a wild animal.  The wounds are too clean, too... aimed.

Yes it's the politics of disenfranchisement and not being listened to. And that is a highly valid reason to vote against the establishment. 

The problem is Trump isn't one of them, not one of the people. He is entirely from the world of the wealthy leeches which is enormously overlapoing with all the tics. Repeatedly stiffing contractors and not paying them; using the rules of bancruptcy to avoid creditors; setting up charities but using them as vehicles to pay for political gain and paying off pornstars; costing the tax payer $6m every time he wants to go to his own club and charging the tax payer for accommodation and conferences in his own places! Drain the swamp? He is right from the swamp! 

He's a populist who told a good story. But he isn't remotely one of the people. He's a robber baron who has sat in a gilded chair all his life with - literally - gold handles in his bathroom. He tells the people what they want to hear to get power and then delivers nothing apart from ill thought through tarrifs that means he gets budgetary income for him from those tarrifs but at the expense of businesses closing down because of the retaliatory tarrifs out in place. The mechanism is cute for him but the net effect is quite literally stealing from the poor to give to himself as a politician. Which of course he portrays as acting tough.

Seriously stop and think about the purpose of prison. It is to re-educate and rehabilitate someone (allegedly) so they can one day re-enter society. If you have ZERO chance of rehabilitation and re-entry is undeserved or would put more people at risk, they give you life imprisonment.

Well think about it this way: You‚Äôre fighting a war, you just finished a months-long battle of taking a castle, they‚Äôve surrendered to you, and now you have to leave and keep fighting the war.

Same with ideas like ‚Äútake no prisoners‚Äù, ‚Äúkill every last man, woman and child‚Äù, ‚Äúburn down their cities‚Äù. All of these were typically terrible ideas from even a technical standpoint, and the Europeans realized this.

What we see in Hollywood is the over-dramatized version of how medieval life was like and they bring the exceptional stuff to the foreground and play it off as common. 

The hard thing about conquest is not the fighting or the killing, it is actually trying to keep the places you‚Äôve conquered from rebelling and taking over the moment you leave, which is why colonization became a more widespread thing rather than conquest, you can‚Äôt subdue a population through sheer power for very long.",1555348073,"in the case of medieval europe (which is what got is based on), battles were brutal and vicious, but they were also follow a certain level of chivalry and honor system.","brutal and vicious","vicious",NA,FALSE,"brutal and vicious","brutal",NA,NA,0

""I don't have any kids, I've never even been in the waiting room while someone was giving birth. Why is it showing this?"" I asked the stranger. I no longer wondered why he was here, why he had these things, or even what his name was. He provided no information but what had been stolen from me over the years and answered no questions. I should have known he wouldn't answer this one. He didn't even look up from the coffee he was drinking. 

I turned my head back to the screen in time to see a nurse bring a new baby in. They placed him/her in a glass case next to a screaming baby. As I watched, the nurse glanced around and switched the name tags on the cases. Her black eyes almost seemed to look directly at the camera I was watching from. Then she looked away and left the room. 

Several minutes later I was a few more beers in when something new happened. The glass separating this room from the next showed a young couple staring in. They smiled to each other as they glanced nervously at the screaming babes. The image sharpened and I recognized them. My parents! 

Another nurse came in the room and picked up the screaming babe, the one whose tag was switched. She walked the baby outside and.... Right to my parents! The camera blurred and moved to the hallway where they stood. 

""Mr. and Mrs. Lovelace, I'm happy to present your new baby girl! Her parents placed her in adoption earlier this day and as you know we matched her up to you,"" the nurse said as she placed the babe in my mother's outstretched arms. Her face radiated pure joy and my father smiled kindly down upon the baby.

""If you wouldn't mind, there's a bit more paperwork to sign before you can take her home,"" the nurse said as they began walking away. ""Do you know what you are going to name her?"" she asked my parents. 

My mother continued to smile down at the little babe. ""We're thinking of naming her after my mother, Amellia Grace,"" she said as they walked out of sight. They passed the nurse that had first swapped the babes, she grinned wide and vicious, but it never reached her coal black eyes.

The stranger suddenly snapped the laptop shut and moved to get up. I grabbed his arm, ""Wait."" But then it turned towards me. No longer the indistinguishable face of a stranger, but the perky face of the nurse with the cold black eyes. She smiled and my grip loosened. She took that moment to pull away and walk out the door. 

Startled I stood there a few moments before running after her.

She looked back at me, already half way down the street.

On the spare parts don't feel bad . It's a lesson and habit you learn. Especially after having to have shipped some stupid cheap part that shipping is  way more . You learn to stock up parts that can go walkabout easily and the vary some by guns, like C308/CETME/HK 91 /G3 rake down pins aren't captured like the AR's so you wanna have spares for cleaning. Sometimes they don't wanna stay put in the stock's keeper holes. Then you can't shoot the gun until you find the dropped pins or find something strong enough to hold the recoil parts together.

The otherworldly madness of the Child of the Emperor was evident in that moment, for all that the Phoenix Conclave had restored some aspect of professionalism and unity to the Third Legion.  His wings pulled in tight behind him as he speared a twitching Hive Guard through the head and casually walked over it.  ""Incredible, Xarik! Sensational!  This is a victory that will go down in the chronicles, and damn me if I'm wrong.  The way the creature flailed at you!""  Koriel laughed again as more of his purple-armored warriors pushed through the press to revel in the joy of the Swarmlord's death.  A few, those less inured to the renewed discipline of the Third, were already cutting trophies from the fallen creature.  Koriel sent one sprawling with the flat of his sword as he moved to Xarik's side.  He pointed out at the field with his sword.  ""Look! The death of this creature has broken even the discipline of this vile horde.""  

He was right.  The Swarmlord was the key synapse creature in the assault, the entity into which the Hive Mind had poured the most of its terrible intelligence.  Its presence had nearly broken the human lines, but conversely its death was a catastrophe.  The synaptic shock of its demise had been sufficient to slay or mortally wound every Tyranid creature within a kilometer, shattering their minds and burning out their brains with the resulting psychic shockwave.  Further out, the Tyranid swarm had reverted to bestial behavior, the remaining synapse creatures too staggered by the death of their prime to marshal their forces.  In some places, Tyranid even fought Tyranid in an internecine mass of clashing claws and gnashing teeth.  They were gunned down and cut to pieces by the defenders, their threat shattered by the loss of coordination.  The Hive would, of course, eventually regain control, but the losses it suffered in those minutes of dissolution were staggering even by the standards of the carnage thus far.  

Vohn's own men had formed a ring of iron around their fallen commander, warding his terribly damaged machine-body with their breacher shields and precise volleys of bolter fire.  The Warsmith's voice was tired over the vox, distorted by the damage that his ironform had suffered.  ""Not... dead... yet.""  Already, an apothecary and a Techmarine in brushed iron were closing in on the fallen Dreadnought, ready to restore organic and artificial alike where they could.  The old Terran had been gravely wounded, but he had suffered worse in his long life.  

And then, from the void, came the final nail in the Tyranid coffin.  The desperate final attack, spearheaded by the fleet's most powerful warrior strain, had been born of the knowledge that the combined legion fleet was on its way.  After days of constant combat and brutal void engagements, the human warships had finally whittled the enemy's numbers down to the point where a counterattack could be mounted.  In high orbit, splashes of bio-plasma haloed the shapes of dying hive ships, while new constellations of engines were picked out by the combined Legion warfleet.  Before long, there were even bombardments of lance strike tearing down into the remainder of the Tyranid horde.

"ei1bomd","**Xelshan Crane:** A beautiful and graceful avian from the planet Xelsha. It is a elegant and slender bird with tall twig-like legs and a long flexible neck. It stands roughly a meter tall from it's feet to it's head. It's adorned with nearly white feathers with the tips of it's wings lined in short golden trim. It commonly enhabits shallow waters and marshes that it uses as it's hunting grounds, typically preying on small fishes. There is a variety of Xelshan cranes that primarily dine on a krill like creature that give their normally white feathers a pinkish-purple hue. Xelshan cranes have a deliberate yet graceful gate when hunting, as to avoid scarring off prey. They're also frequently approachable and surprisingly easy to tame, due to near lack of predators in the regions they inhabit. 

**Domesticated Massif:** Bulky woolly creatures roughly a little over a meter in height. They resemble something of a cross between a bison and a sheep. They have thick woolly fur that is usually in hues of reddish-browns. The females have short stubby horns while the males have longer spiral horns usually used to attract females. While wild Massifs can be territorial, Domesticated Massifs are quite docile and curious and sometimes are kept as pets. Domesticated Massifs are a very versatile live-stock, bread for their wool, their meat, their hide, their milk and even their bones. Which are mineral rich and are often used to make vitamin supplements and a few civilian grade composite materials. 

**Vrunkilin:** Roughly translates to ""The Warrior's Friend"" in Mackilin. It is a warmblooded reptilian like creature native to the planet Mackila.

A wild Vrunkilin is typically very aggressive and vicious, but an effective Mackilin breeder can tame the aggressive side and turn them into loyal companions.

"eh6xubg","&gt;I think that it might not be wise for someone arguing for worldwide veganism to attempt to use an appeal to popular opinion.

Haha, appeal to popular opinion?  Do you think that I think that my position is popular?  I'm fully aware that my opinion is the minority opinion.  I was simply responding to your doubt that anyone other than me would hold that position, not trying to convince you that my position was right *because* some other vegans will hold it. 
If anything, your original doubt that anyone other than me holds my opinion is an appeal to popular opinion, or, in your case, appeal to unpopular opinion.  That being said, though, I certainly agree that the popularity of my opinion, or yours, has little to nothing to do with that opinion being true or false.

&gt;I do support your absolute right to choose not to eat meat or any other class of foods for whatever reason you feel is important...  I do not criticize people for choosing different diets from the one I have chosen.

An absolute right?!  You're aware there has been slavery?  And you're aware there have been cannibals?  It's hardly far from it being a real possibility that a society decided to breed other human beings for their milk and meat, raising them until they hit their prime and slaughtering them.  Of course, since they want to maximize profits, they will be kept in cramp conditions, etc. etc.  And, even those lucky few who were raised in humane conditions, the good lives they were enjoying were ended prematurely.  Now, do I have a right to eat this food?  Surely not.  Would you be so noble, so virtuous, in not criticizing me for choosing to eat this food?  Quite the contrary!!!

Or, take situations that actually happened.  In England during the slavery days, the sugar people used in tea was farmed by slaves in brutal conditions.  Women abolitionists at the time - the people who would serve tea to their male counterparts - refused to put sugar in people's tea.  I mean, heaven's to Betsy!  How unbecoming for them to implicitly criticize their choice to drink their tea with sugar!  How ignoble and vicious!  But, no, you don't think that.  And you don't think that because you understand that you don't need sugar in your tea to have a good life and that such an insistence on having sugar in your tea (at least at the place and during the time in question) (1) encourages the breeding of someones who (2) stand to either (i) have life worth living cut short or (ii) have life that was worse than not worth living.  And, for those reasons, you not only think that such criticism isn't inappropriate, you think instead *to not criticize* would be inappropriate, after all the well-being of someones are at stake here.

Now what's the god damn difference here?  That in the above cases we're talking about humans instead of non-human animals.  But belonging to one biological category rather than to another is, by itself, morally arbitrary, just as belonging to one race rather than to another is a morally arbitrary.  And, just as, if the only reason you appeal to in making a case that it is okay to subject a different race to the conditions described above is because of their difference in race, then you'd be racist, if the only reason you appeal to in making a case that it is okay to subject non-human animals to the conditions described above is because of their difference in humanness, then you're being speciesist.  As such, you'd deserve criticism.  As such, you should be given unsolicited advice.  Billions of someones per year depend on us to start making the morally right decision.

I know you don't *feel* morally obligated to change diet, but you do *have* one, just as the men didn't *feel* a moral obligation to stop using sugar in their tea still *had* a moral obligation to stop.  For whatever it's worth, it seems to me that some of the reason you don't feel such an obligation is because you're trusting in a distorted view of what livestock animals' lives are like.  You've made comments about the humaneness of some animals' treatment, but they are a very small minority.  You've appealed to genetic improvement.  But their genetics actually harm them, in the way that many pure bred dogs' genetics harm them.  You've appealed to the idea that they have it better than animals in nature, but chickens in factory farms absolutely do not.  They cannot form natural pecking orders, resulting at them pecking at one another and cannibalizing one another, and a great of stress, etc.  Most cows sold for beef will live at most a year out in pasture.  The next few months they will be stuck in crowded feed lots before being slaughtered, which is itself a brutal and terrifying process for them.  Dairy cows are continually kept pregnant; otherwise, they wouldn't produce milk.  Of course, that's hard on their bodies.  Their calves are immediately taken away from them.  If you see a video of this, it is clear it stresses them out as much as it stresses out the Mexican mothers down in Brownsville TX that have had their children taken away from them.  The atrocities to be listed off go on and on and on and on and on.  And this happens on the order of billions per year.  The rosy picture you have of their lives is not the reality.  And the shear size of this moral crisis is absolutely staggering.  Please, stop!  You have the legal right to do this to these someones, but you certainly have no moral right to do so.

"eh5m53j","Thanks for the reply--I think about this a lot, and am asked this a lot. Did the fact that Mary was a woman make a difference? Absolutely--in ways so interrelated and vast that I won't attempt to describe them. But it's also too simple an explanation--the whole she was a strong independent woman ahead of her time argument just doesn't get us very far. It collapses all the strong independent women into each other, and there were a lot of ways to be one, and it affected them in very different ways. It is surprising to see the diversity of roles women could take and the diversity of responses. Some women worked quite publicly and quite aggressively - Jane Swisshelm takes the cake here. She was vilified by many, but everybody read her stuff. Jessie Benton Fremont was more than assertive, and it was well taken. The Abolition movement owes much of its success to it being the first real opportunity women had to speak at meetings and write and all that. It welcomed female participation. But obviously, the gender roles were strict and affected everything. 

A key point, though it may seem like a tangent, is that people were *really* tolerant of eccentricity--politicians were some of the oddest characters in American history at this time. Many had all manner of deformities, and a lot were cross-eyed. Now, only the most conventional, boring, somewhat goodlooking people get anywhere. The prevalence of eccentricity and earnest intensity in social and religious movements and politics, from say, 1840-1860, both caused and ended the Civil War. They were incredible people--vicious but generally sincere and principled, and they could speak on a level totally alien to us. They were like supermen. Their intensity and commitment to higher aims is admirable and attractive--it also meant passionate conflict was inevitable. It also meant they could rise to the occasion, and had more than enough fight in them to lead and prosecute the war as much as such an ugly, unpredictable war would let them. Character ruled the day--obviously, not everyone had a good character, but that was at least the general standard. Not likeability, not money, not anything else. Of course, some people cared more about money than anything else, but character was ever-demanded, and someone with character could ascend to the highest position. People with character tend to be not fixated on style etc. and have the confidence to be who they are, so they were probably more eccentric by nature, and etc.

Look up Horace Greeley and James Gordon Bennett. Two of the most powerful Americans of that time. It's hard to believe they were real people. ""Traditional values"" are nothing of the sort we claim. 

Eccentric women were much less tolerated. Extremely bold ones, like Swisshelm, were tolerated by some. Mary's issue is hard to pin down. She definitely had some mental illness, was highly emotional/volatile, and had tantrums or rages that upset people. Her assertiveness and political involvement definitely annoyed some people, but it was her anger and disdain towards those she perceived as enemies that pissed them off the most. Her tantrums seem to have been relatively few and private. But she had a talent for sarcasm and enjoyed using it--she didn't always mean it harshly, but it didn't always go over well. She was also rather proudly eccentric. Much of what was said about her was intentionally malicious press coverage that exaggerated her behavior--they focused more on her political involvement, but it went beyond that. It was allegations of corruption, somewhat sustained, but made as part of partisan warfare following Lincoln's death, not out of concern about corruption. She had real flaws, but she got drawn into nasty newspaper warfare that was viciously waged with many references to Lincoln's conduct in the White House. It's hard to explain. They blew real issues out of proportion, not to sell papers but maliciously for a variety of reasons. It was deliberate. Her general oddity and anger were not really subjects of concern until later.

But her general oddity was noted. There was something about her that really struck certain people, and what it is is hard to reconstruct. Multiple people said they'd never met a person like her, and they would say both wonderful and harsh things about her. She was like entrancing in a way, I guess, intense, brilliant, entertaining, interesting, but also a real fighter and schemer. It would have been much different had she been a man--but she would have been an eccentric, scheming man. Scheming is no big deal--that's part of being a politician and an aggressive, prominent person. But even if she had been a man, she would have been notably eccentric and intense, but that would have been ok. It's not like, oh if she was a man, no one would bat an eye. It went beyond that. In many ways, what got her in trouble was not just saying she was a strong woman and going in that direction, critics be damned. She couldn't go that far--she still saw herself as a traditional woman who just worked harder for her goals and had a strong personality. That worked while her husband was alive; when he was dead she still had that drive but couldn't do anything. So she begged powerful men for money for years. In her mind, they were supposed to take care of her, and in many ways they were, and some did. She wasn't entitled in that sense--she just believed in the traditional idea that a woman was supported and protected by a man, and for various reasons that didn't go well. It was the role she had been raised to play, and she saw it as a matter of respect. Few men if any could replace the role Lincoln played, and she couldn't go live a quiet life in Springfield--she was someone too lively and worldly for that. Eventually, she went in a more independent direction, but she was such a mess at that point (Tad had died), that she used her independence to wander around visiting spiritual mediums. Had she become a writer or joined a cause (which I think she did consider), she may have had a much better life. She had close friends who lived very nontraditional lives, which she admired. She wasn't disapproving, but she just couldn't get there.

I also attended art school for a while and sat through a LOT of critiques of my own work and other students' work. There is no nice way to tell someone that their art is ""just OK."" It's hard to say, and hard to hear. Art is really tricky because there are so few metrics you can apply to it. You could pick up another hobby, like, I dunno, golf or something, and watch your performance improve in the context of its rules and KNOW you're getting better at it, but with art there's no one to tell you when you've reached the next level of skill. You have to impress yourself and you will always be your own worst critic.

I've been outright insulted more times than I could count online, but those comments are easy to brush off when I know someone's *trying* to hurt my feelings.

Yeah, the best they could squeak out in their attempt to avoid it was a monument to deranged viciousness. It speaks very poorly of their capability.

No, the most harmful thing they have done is the **millenia of ritualistic slavery and drow sacrifice**. And then fucking up their own apotheosis badly enough they needed a godling unwilling to exercise her power (and therefore far easier to take) to stumble in.

This is an entirely new kind of relationship, something as yet unseen in the narrative, for good or ill. Whether or not someone likes it, it shouldn't be written the same as other relationships have.

As yet the relationship itself is worryingly undefined and has been for far too long. We badly need to learn the specifics of their arrangement.

"edbilht","Wait, you didn't say before it was a _beholder_! Man look at my name, I love those goofy-lookin' psychopaths! There's all sorts of potential reasons:

- The beholder has discovered a way to turn Spectators (who also hail from Mechanus) back to the Chaotic Side. However, attempting this on a wider scale to have his own spectator army would attract big P's attention for sure, and the beholder can't take him or his infinite army of modrons and hierarchs on directly, so. He needs the deity distracted, off-balance, so he can steal an entire _species_ out from under his lack-of-nose.

- Beholders are mad and vicious, but they also love one thing Primus is great at - domination. Primus' modrons are blindly, unwaveringly loyal (besides the statistically rare rogue modron). Primus accomplishes this through literal programming of life forms, and this Beholder might want to steal his methods of creation and programming directly - or even _take his place_. More Minions Than Any Beholder Has Ever Had!

- The taking the place of Primus thing sounds ridiculous, but it's actually happened before! In the old 2e The Great Modron March adventure, well...I don't want to give too many spoilers but another Big Bad kills Primus for a while and takes his place to have the modrons look for something _he_ wants in their March. You could even have the beholder's minions like the slaadi searching for lore on this older Big Bad &gt;!It was Orcus, back from the dead, and he was looking for his wand!&lt; and Mechanus, just to give the PCs more strange clues to follow (slaadi searching for musty tomes and ancient Regulus devices? That's weird even for them.)

- Primus eventually recovers (when one of his Secundus wins their duels and ascends to the position), so maybe the beholder could find a way to masquerade as one. Even neater if the beholder builds some kind of modron-beholder shell that doesn't even _look_ like a Secundus at all, but emits strong signals in Modron that convinces all the extremely Lawful modrons that it is. They know _something's_ wrong (and may even enlist the PCs for help), but they can't see it even though it's right in front of them...Truesight doesn't help when your enemy is inside a physical device that's telling you everything you want to hear.

- The Infinity Web. The source of Primus' power. A well of infinite energy at the heart of Mechanus which Primus discovered, before modrons, before the giant gears, before anything. Primus uses it for his Vast Work - creating life endlessly in the Modrons and making great portals to countless worlds. He can use the Infinity Web to transmit energy anywhere to do anything. He can use it to repair his minions instantly, create giant devices in the blink of an eye, power planet-sized gears, fuel an entire microcosm of a campaign world as a ""testing platform"" (like he does in my game!), and obliterate things that impede the Work. Now...any idea what a beholder could do with all that power? Even stealing _access_ to the Infinity Web, like someone splicing into a neighbor's box to steal cable, would grant the beholder nigh endless resources for his own ""projects"".

- Beholders are genius, paranoid, and above all, vain. There is one thing a beholders hates above all else, and that's other beholders who don't look like them. Maybe the beholder has noticed how regimented and uniform the modrons are, and come up with a truly insane plan. It will defeat or distract Primus, wrest control of the Infinity Web, and...use it to _turn all beholders into ITS kind of beholder_. Or kill them. Or turn every modron into a biomechanical version of itself. Or reorganize the massive continent-sized gears and junk of Mechanus itself...into a _plane-sized replica of the beholder's own form!_ The ultimate vanity project (that it can then use to become a god and/or blast other planes directly with its Infinity Web-powered eye rays the size of pulsar beams.)

You can't make him look bad to hardly anyone even by twisting everything into the worst light possible even if your echo chamber tells you otherwise. If you want to attack him to feel self righteous then stop pretending like your doing a service, it's disgusting. If you actually want to make anything better then change your tone and methods and learn how to talk to people. 

If you took the time to actually consider other peoples points of view then you might actually make some progress, but assuming the worst in any possible circumstance, calling someone awful over and over, pushing a flimsy narrative without evidence you call ""facts"", and attacking people under the pretense of helping only shows that you are willfully brainwashed by problems of your own and projecting.

"ec1l2li","**tl;dr** he's an older, arrogant, berating coach/player who has been a toxic part of the online community for a long time. Just when you want to feel bad for him, he does or says something to make you go ""oh, nevermind"". He very well could be bipolar.

Frank is this older fellow who considers himself very humble and spiritual. He was quite famous on the older ultimate message boards before reddit became a big thing. Essentially, he had these ideas for how ultimate should be played. He called it dribbling, basically, give and goes in whatever direction, take whatever is open while staying in a good position, make yourself a jack of all trades, etc. (if you're interested in seeing some form of it, look up Petey's Pirates mixed team out of Columbus). More than most people, I really wanted to hear out Frank because the bits and pieces of the way he described his system sound exactly like how I like to play. It's like 3v3 mini turned into a full field.

Rather than clearly explaining his ideas and why they would be an improvement over the current state of that part of the game, though, he would just complain about the current rules of ultimate and berate people who questioned him or said why they think a current part of ultimate that he didn't like was actually fine. He did this for a very long time and never changed. Along the way, he would belittle people, constantly calling them morons. I think that was his favorite word. 

After a while of this happening, I think he was kind of pushed out of those old message boards, or he was at least not encouraged by people anymore (I'm not very familiar with that part of the timeline). He worked his way over to reddit. At first, he was just advertising dischoops (his game that's kind of like goaltimate I think) and sharing his ideas for how to run an offense. It didn't take very long for the people who didn't know him already to figure out what kind of a person he was, though. He once again would berate people, say that great players were shitty just because they didn't play how he played or throw how he threw. 

I think my least favorite part about him is the fact that he always talks about how 10 years ago, he would destroy everyone on the field even though he was an older man. No one could stop him. If it weren't for the fact that his teammates didn't know his offense, he would dominate the club scene even at an old age *blah blah blah*. Maybe he isn't lying, but the issue is that he has very few vocal witnesses and no video evidence of anything except him throwing with both hands. He's allegedly coached and played with/against some high profile teams and players, but no one from that pool has really stepped forward and said many positive things about him. I think one Ring guy said that he was pretty good for his age, and another guy said that he had pretty solid but very strange throws, but there hasn't been some end-all post about him actually being a great player or his system being potentially dominant. 

The icing on the cake started a couple years ago. He had run his course through the r/ultimate community. Insulted and berated everyone who didn't praise him while he tried to play the victim card at the same time. Everyone was sick of him. Then, one day, he made a seemingly heart-felt post asking how he could clear up his name and could start getting back on the community's good side. It was actually a good thread. People gave him advice and some hard truths that weren't out of line. Some people were still vicious, but most were genuine. Some thought that maybe he would actually make an effort and we could all hear the details of his ultimate offense in a clear, calm manner. He didn't. 

Not too long after that post, he had his final straw here that I believe got him banned and may have pushed him from ultimate almost entirely. He was the coach for App State men's college team for about a semester. Apparently, it was kind of on a trial period. It sounds like he just jumped right in and coached how he wanted to coach without easing in or reading the room/knowing his audience there. He chalked it up to being ""old school""; I think it was more him being stubborn and now perceptive. A lot of players were apparently threatening to quit, so the captains parted ways with him after a semester. After that, he got way more petty than he should have for a grown adult and threatened to contact USAU about App State knowingly using unregistered players in sanctioned tournaments. He was ranting about how he could get them banned or suspended  and how he was wronged and either they take him back as their coach or he spills the beans and ruins their team. In reality, it's unlikely that they would suffer anything more than forfeiting the games that they had played in those tournaments and being on probation. They weren't a national-caliber team, so doing what they did wasn't a huge deal to most people. 

Regardless, Frank wanted to take them down. He wanted everyone to tell him he was right and to do it and teach those kids a lesson. No one was on his side. Everyone was pretty turned off that a grown man could be so power-hungry and petty and play the victim card so hard. Of course when people told him this, he lashed out at them *again*. Once again, I liked his idea of how to get a team on the right path where he judged players based on teamwork and not caring about the stat sheet or being the star, but once again, the way he went about doing it was completely wrong. He became stubborn old arrogant man again.

Frank is like a light version of the Westboro Baptist Church. Deep down, I think he has good intentions, but it's *so* deep down and *so* covered in blatant negativity at this point, that people shouldn't give him the time of day anymore and need to just ignore it. 

He holds clinics occasionally teaching his offense and basics of how to play his way of playing. Actually offered it to my club team one time when our twitter guy was trolling him. Apparently the clinics are pretty good and he's usually a pleasant person at them. If he wants to keep doing those and people are interested, then okay, but besides that, he's been so toxic for so long in so many places that people are sick of him and want him to go away.

That's the gist of it. I might be a little ignorant in a couple places, but I've been on r/ultimate long enough to see the majority of his story unfold and to know what kind of a person he is online.

"ebsesdv","Effects need to have similar causes. I wouldn‚Äôt plant a pepper plant and expect a tomato plant to sprout.
The cause of every moment must be a previous moment. This must go back infinitely. In Buddhism, this means there is beginningless time. 

In beginningless time, we have made countless actions. The wealth of karma to play out is quite literally uncountable.

The only way to escape the cycle of birth and death is to resolve fundamental ignorance about the world. This can be done by having the realization of the emptiness of inherent existence. Once we have this realization, we will stop clinging to positive feeling stimuli and generating aversion to negative feeling stimuli. 

Already ‚Äòyou‚Äô (armbar22) are not involved once the body passed. Armbar22 exists on the basis of a body and a mind. Armbar22 will die with the body. However, out of our ignorance of the way things exist, the mind (which has no personhood) is thrust into generating another rebirth consciousness by the karmic force ‚Äòstored‚Äô on it. Sense faculties develop in the womb and eventually make contact. Once there is a body and a mind, another person can be merely labeled based on that basis (not you, but the product of actions in a past life). 

And so, as we continue thinking there is some inherent existence of personhood/identity, the vicious cycle of creating more karma which results in more aging, sickness, and death continues. The cycle of samsara is vicious, but escapable.

It's a fact. All you need to do is browse, I don't know, January's (good start?) posts with criticism against Moffat and you'll see that there. 

I haven't been going around personally attacking every person who keep saying ""Chibnall is a terrible writer!"", even though they annoy me. I don't see how that makes me vicious, but nice try. And that's absolutely rubbish, yes. Chibnall is an excellent writer.

Every writer has their strengths and weaknesses, none of them are perfect, and just coming out and saying he's a bad writer because his weaknesses bother you and saying it's an objective fact is an opinion I just roll my eyes at. Like I said, a lot of people who have stuck around have started to be more reasonable and describe what they see as flawed in his writing, and I agree with a few of them (other opinions, I actually like Chibnall's vision rather than the commen'ts, such was when it comes to plot arcs and connections between stories. Tthe fact a lot to people seem to be eagerly waiting for the Doctor to throw a hissy fit, and I'll be happy if she never does. I also really like his villains a lot more than the black and white evil some seem to want).

But truth is, Chibnall's flaws don't bother me a lot, and I love his strengths, so I love his episodes. There's no objective opinion in this subject.

That would translate to losing the ability to target military purchases to areas whose votes the government of the day need.

Bottom line, Canada needs a strong (not necessarily very large but larger than what it has now) and stable military the same way cities need a strong and stable fire and police services. Saying Canada in no threat of wars/invasions/etc so military spending is unnecessary is like saying City x has not had a fire lately so there is no need to adequately fund the fire department.

Special Counsel Robert Mueller‚Äôs office is exploring whether longtime Trump adviser Roger Stone tried to intimidate and discredit a witness who is contradicting Mr. Stone‚Äôs version of events about his contacts with WikiLeaks, according to people who have spoken to Mr. Mueller‚Äôs investigators.

In grand jury sessions and interviews, prosecutors have repeatedly asked about emails, text messages and online posts involving Mr. Stone and his former friend, New York radio personality Randy Credico, the people said. Mr. Stone has asserted that Mr. Credico was his backchannel to WikiLeaks, a controversial transparency group, an assertion Mr. Credico denies.

Mr. Mueller‚Äôs investigators are probing whether Mr. Stone had direct contact with WikiLeaks and knew ahead of time about its release of stolen Democratic emails, as he claimed during the campaign and now denies. Mr. Stone says he is angry at Mr. Credico because his ex-friend has ‚Äúrefused to tell the truth‚Äù about being his conduit to WikiLeaks.

Filmmaker David Lugo, who knows both men, said in an interview he has testified before Mr. Mueller‚Äôs grand jury about a blog post Mr. Stone helped him draft that was harshly critical of Mr. Credico. Another witness, businessman Bill Samuels, said he was questioned by Mr. Mueller‚Äôs team about Mr. Credico‚Äôs reaction to allegedly threatening messages sent by Mr. Stone.

Prosecutors also are examining messages between Messrs. Stone and Credico that involve the radio personality‚Äôs decision to assert his Fifth Amendment before Congress, according to a person familiar with the probe.

WikiLeaks released thousands of emails from and to John Podesta, Hillary Clinton‚Äôs campaign chairman, before the 2016 election. Mr. Mueller‚Äôs office has alleged that the emails were illegally hacked by Russian intelligence operatives, then released through WikiLeaks and fake online personas to influence the election.

President Trump has repeatedly denied colluding with Russia, and Moscow has rejected assertions that it interfered in American politics. WikiLeaks didn‚Äôt respond to a request for comment.

In an email to The Wall Street Journal, Mr. Stone categorically denied any effort to intimidate Mr. Credico. An attorney for Mr. Stone said he hasn‚Äôt been contacted by Mr. Mueller‚Äôs office. A spokesman for Mr. Mueller‚Äôs office declined to comment.

For the past few months, Mr. Credico has expressed concern about public attacks from Mr. Stone and his associates. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs getting his friends out there to slime me,‚Äù Mr. Credico said in a message to the Journal earlier this month. Mr. Credico appeared before the grand jury in September.

Mr. Mueller‚Äôs team is examining whether Mr. Stone, along with several other pro-Trump activists, knew in advance about WikiLeaks‚Äô release of Democrats‚Äô emails in the 2016 campaign, according to people familiar with the matter. At the heart of Mr. Mueller‚Äôs inquiry is the question of whether anyone in Mr. Trump‚Äôs orbit participated in Russia‚Äôs efforts to hack and release the materials.

During the campaign, Mr. Stone said repeatedly that he was in communication with WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange and predicted Mr. Assange would release batches of emails damaging to Mrs. Clinton, a prediction that proved accurate.

Since then, he has said his statements were exaggerated and that his knowledge of WikiLeaks‚Äô plans came from Mr. Credico, who had interviewed Mr. Assange on his radio program in August 2016. WikiLeaks has said it was not in touch with Mr. Stone at the time he was publicly claiming contact with the group.

Mr. Stone first cited Mr. Credico as a backchannel last fall before the House Intelligence Committee, and since then has attacked Mr. Credico directly and through associates. Mr. Credico has also publicly criticized Mr. Stone.

In emails sent to Mr. Credico and reviewed by the Journal, Mr. Stone threatened to ‚Äúsue the f‚Äî‚Äù out of him, called him ‚Äúa loser a liar and a rat‚Äù and told him to ‚Äúprepare to die c‚Äî sucker.‚Äù

Mr. Stone was also involved in drafting a May blog post harshly criticizing Mr. Credico, which he gave to Mr. Lugo, the filmmaker.

Mr. Lugo published a version of the article for ArtVoice, a website Mr. Stone writes for, with the headline ""Phony Russia Gate, Roger Stone &amp; the lies of Randy Credico.‚Äù The piece asserted that Mr. Credico had said on multiple occasions that he was Mr. Stone‚Äôs conduit to WikiLeaks.

‚ÄúThey were looking into the intimidation stuff at first,‚Äù said Mr. Lugo in a text message to the Journal, referring to his talks with Mr. Mueller‚Äôs team. ‚ÄúThey were following up on ‚Äòconspiring‚Äô ‚Äù to intimidate a witness, he said.

Mr. Lugo said that while it was his idea to write the blog piece, the first draft came from Mr. Stone, and he softened some of the language so it wasn‚Äôt ‚Äútoo personal.‚Äù ‚ÄúI gave them the entire email chain showing them how it was created, so we will see what happens,‚Äù said Mr. Lugo, who said the emails show he didn‚Äôt attempt to intimidate a witness.

Mr. Stone said he suggested Mr. Lugo write an op-ed because he and Mr. Lugo were frustrated with Mr. Credico‚Äôs ‚Äúmany lies in the press.‚Äù A writer who works for Mr. Stone helped with the draft, he said, because Mr. Lugo ‚Äúis not an experienced writer.‚Äù

Mr. Lugo said he stands by his claim in the article that Mr. Credico told him he was Mr. Stone‚Äôs back channel to WikiLeaks in May of 2017. He also says he turned over to prosecutors a chain of combative messages that Mr. Credico sent to him after the story was published.

Mr. Credico has said his previous statements to Mr. Lugo and others about being Mr. Stone‚Äôs ‚Äúback channel‚Äù were made in jest and at Mr. Stone‚Äôs urging.

Separately, Mr. Mueller‚Äôs investigators in September questioned Mr. Samuels, a businessman friend of Mr. Credico, about Mr. Credico‚Äôs reaction to the allegedly threatening messages from Mr. Stone. In some of those messages, Mr. Stone threatened to sue Mr. Credico and accused him of wearing a wire for Mr. Mueller, the Journal has reported.

Mr. Samuels told the Journal that Mr. Credico was intimidated almost to the point of a nervous breakdown. Mr. Samuels‚Äô involvement in the Mueller probe was reported earlier this month by the New York Times.

Mr. Stone said, the ‚Äúthreatening messages he sent to me are as bad and worse. Our entire exchange is blunt vulgar and vicious but I never urged him to do anything other than tell the truth.‚Äù

In March, when Mr. Credico worried he was in the crosshairs of the Intelligence Committee, Mr. Stone assured him Democrats couldn‚Äôt act against him and the Republicans would not. ‚ÄúThe Minority has no authority,‚Äù Mr. Stone wrote, in a message reviewed by the Journal.

Mr. Stone said that while he discussed with Mr. Credico whether to assert his Fifth Amendment rights, ‚Äútext messages in my possession prove he did so on the advice of his attorney.‚Äù

&gt; Mr. Mueller‚Äôs team is examining whether Mr. Stone, along with several other pro-Trump activists, knew in advance about WikiLeaks‚Äô release of Democrats‚Äô emails in the 2016 campaign, according to people familiar with the matter. At the heart of Mr. Mueller‚Äôs inquiry is the question of whether anyone in Mr. Trump‚Äôs orbit participated in Russia‚Äôs efforts to hack and release the materials.

&gt; During the campaign, Mr. Stone said repeatedly that he was in communication with WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange and predicted Mr. Assange would release batches of emails damaging to Mrs. Clinton, a prediction that proved accurate.

&gt; Since then, he has said his statements were exaggerated and that his knowledge of WikiLeaks‚Äô plans came from Mr. Credico, who had interviewed Mr. Assange on his radio program in August 2016. WikiLeaks has said it was not in touch with Mr. Stone at the time he was publicly claiming contact with the group.

&gt; Mr. Stone first cited Mr. Credico as a backchannel last fall before the House Intelligence Committee, and since then has attacked Mr. Credico directly and through associates. Mr. Credico has also publicly criticized Mr. Stone.

"e9p509h","Special Counsel Robert Mueller‚Äôs office is exploring whether longtime Trump adviser Roger Stone tried to intimidate and discredit a witness who is contradicting Mr. Stone‚Äôs version of events about his contacts with WikiLeaks, according to people who have spoken to Mr. Mueller‚Äôs investigators.

In grand jury sessions and interviews, prosecutors have repeatedly asked about emails, text messages and online posts involving Mr. Stone and his former friend, New York radio personality Randy Credico, the people said. Mr. Stone has asserted that Mr. Credico was his backchannel to WikiLeaks, a controversial transparency group, an assertion Mr. Credico denies.

Mr. Mueller‚Äôs investigators are probing whether Mr. Stone had direct contact with WikiLeaks and knew ahead of time about its release of stolen Democratic emails, as he claimed during the campaign and now denies. Mr. Stone says he is angry at Mr. Credico because his ex-friend has ‚Äúrefused to tell the truth‚Äù about being his conduit to WikiLeaks.

Filmmaker David Lugo, who knows both men, said in an interview he has testified before Mr. Mueller‚Äôs grand jury about a blog post Mr. Stone helped him draft that was harshly critical of Mr. Credico. Another witness, businessman Bill Samuels, said he was questioned by Mr. Mueller‚Äôs team about Mr. Credico‚Äôs reaction to allegedly threatening messages sent by Mr. Stone.

Prosecutors also are examining messages between Messrs. Stone and Credico that involve the radio personality‚Äôs decision to assert his Fifth Amendment before Congress, according to a person familiar with the probe.

Good or evil are kind of subjective and usually from the perspective of the person calling things good and evil.

"e9ac10j","Yea! I have experience being in a binge-restrict cycle. First of all, good on you for acknowledging that you are having some trouble.  Next step is to address why you have these problems, ie why are you binging.

For me, there were two major reasons why I was stuck in the cycle. First, I had a bad relationship with eating. I realised a lot of times I binged because I was bored or sad. I think a lot of us struggle with emotional eating, and I think it‚Äôs fine to use food to satisfy emotions sometimes (it‚Äôs human nature to associate food with reward), however there‚Äôs a difference between having a few spoonfuls of ice cream after a long day and binging tubfuls of it just to not feel sad. What I did was to rediscover old hobbies, such as drawing/reading/sewing as a way to tackle stress/sadness/other negative emotions. I also had to explain to myself, food doesn‚Äôt fill that void of boredom and loneliness, and it definitely isn‚Äôt a long term solution to sadness. A lot of others may recommend the podcast ‚ÄúBrain Over Binge‚Äù to help consolidate this mindset.

Another reason why I binged was... because I restricted. It‚Äôs a vicious but very logical cycle. The more you restrict and deprive, the more you crave. There‚Äôs the Forbidden Fruit idea to explain that psychology, and biologically if you are in a nutritional deficit, you‚Äôd naturally crave more calorific foods, which usually come in the form of junk foods such as candy or chips or pizza or burgers. All that good stuff. There was a blog I read (I can‚Äôt remember the link sorry) that explained how restricting ultimately leads to binging. So the way I dealt with this was to stop restricting so much. I stopped counting calories and restricting my daily intake, and I also stopped cutting out food groups. To be honest, I ate a lot more than usual in the first few days, but after a while, the body naturally recalibrated and I was able to feel the difference between hunger and fullness again. I stopped gaining weight after and slowly returned to my normal weight. Just trust your body in this sense.

When i would settle down for a long playthrough of any game my significant other at the time would read a book, do puzzles, etc. When she got tired of waiting for me to stop playing she would usually get naked, walk by me pantyless in a short silk night gown or just start ""playing"" with me lol. She was a great sport :P Anyway\~

In your case however the game was not the problem. The problem is stemming from something that has built up over time that either one of you or both have ignored.

Sounds like the problem at the time however was he wanted to have sex in your free time but was to busy playing a game. He waited up for you to have sex after your game session but over the hours that lust turned into resentment. By the time you came to bed it was to late to save the night. His sex craved mind turned to anger/resentment had already taken over probably about 2 hours after your gaming session started given the times you stated.

After reading more:

Yes you should def have more sex. 1 or 2 times per week is FUCKING PATHETIC.

Also why did you say that you initiate sex?  Have you conditioned this man so much so that he no longer tries to initiate sex? Have you turned him down so often to cause that result? Something you have been doing/not doing has caused that result. That makes him pretty much feel like a useless person. I understand why he said you feel like a roommate.

Since he is on the lease then technically you cannot kick him out. If you think he will hit you then thats another story but in the eyes of the law i dont think you can do much of anything with him on the lease.

The cat should stay with you.

I wouldnt want a girlfriend who has sex 1-2 times per week either lmao.

You should be having sex like 5-14 times a week regardless of your job, the more the better of course.

It seems he doesnt feel wanted in the relationship. The hardly no sex also probably makes him think you are not really sexually attracted to him. His lack of income also most likely has a big effect on how he feels about himself. Yalls problems started a long time ago thats for sure. It will never get better until you both sit down and hash it out between the two of you with no holds barred. Either you will come to an understanding of each other and work on a way to move forward, or will both will realize the relationship is a sinking titantic with no hope. Either way it needs to be done.

Most people in those situations turn negative and feed into that overtime making it worse and worse until what happened that night. Most partners are aware of this and choose to ignore it as well, or they get angry back and then continues a vicious but mostly silent cycle of back and forth

Man was Dianna cool there. I enjoyed her seeing Loran more, and I think she gained a significant appreciation for him. Maybe the admiration he had for Dianna is mutual, although he doesn't know it because he thinks she's Kihel. Regardless, Dianna is best girl of this series by a longshot right now. 

Is this new girl with Guin going to replace Kihel, and make her turn against him?

Questions:

1. Guin. Only because he was so much more smug and manipulative. Corin is annoying and vicious, but just insane. The actions of both have had similar reprocussions, but one seems much worse than the other because of said smugness (and seeming disregard for others' lives). 

2. Kind of expected. The Gundam pulling a win out of its ass has been a theme so I wasn't surprised at how it ended. What was surprising was Dianna stepping in, and that was awesome. I don't feel too strongly about Corin now. I believe he's been neutered a bit now, and won't be the threat he used to be.

"e7c85bw","Yes, this was a first for me! I've seen minor squabbles before - they always look scary and vicious but usually the two dogs disengage each other before a human even gets close enough to intervene.  Seeing an actual fight is pretty rare in my experience as well. I think this made me panic because a) it was under a picnic table so we couldn't reach them easily and really couldn't even SEE very well to tell exactly what was happening, b) it was my own dog being hurt (obviously makes it worse!), c) he wasn't fighting back, was crying, and the other dog wasn't stopping at that point (which I've always seen dogs do in the past - stop once the other dog says NO MORE!) and d) I'm still on edge (and probably will be for years) about our last dog passing away traumatically.  

My preferred local dog park is like what your last sentence describes - it's a large, mostly-fenced natural park area with woods and fields and trails, and the dogs usually walk/run with their owners and there's very little dog-to-dog play - you see the other dogs while you're walking and often they'll run together and maybe play ab it, but it's almost all exploring and running and playing side-by-side versus with each other.

"e716vw1","A vicious, but ultimately sacrificial, screen was absolutely the role of the ACRs. You can't forward deploy V and VII Corps. The op tempo to stay ready for imminent contact is way too high for all permanently stationed peacetime units to maintain. In addition, any forward deployed units are under direct Soviet observation and the Soviet artillery umbrella, and as terrible an idea as that was for the Germans in World War II, it was exponentially worse in the Cold War.

So instead of placing V and VII Corps directly in the path of the maelstrom, you place two grossly oversized ""regiments"" in the way. Despite being much larger than their name implies, they are a small enough unit that keeping them at the requisite op tempo for frontline operations during peacetime is doable. Their job was threefold:

1. Serve as a proverbial tripwire to force Soviet forces to commit an act of war right at the border

2. Serve as a figurative ""Whipple shield"", sacrificing their combat strength to blunt the leading MRR's of a Soviet advance through an active defense, buying V and VII Corps sufficient time to mobilize into effectiveness

3. Actively fight for the reconnaissance to identify the main thrust of Soviet operations and find weaknesses that V and VII Corps can exploit after they finish mobilizing

At no point were the ACRs realistically expected to survive this effort in any appreciable force. Politicians would hem and haw and rivet count about survivability, but few realistic analysts came up with any answer other than using the remaining combat effectiveness of the ACRs as a ticking clock for V and VII Corps to beat in their rush to prepare their own defensive positions.",1538493973,"a vicious, but ultimately sacrificial, screen was absolutely the role of the acrs.","vicious, but ultimately","vicious","but",TRUE,"vicious , but ultimately sacrificial","sacrificial",NA,"ultimately",1

"e5uqw88","I found the work he cites online about revealing one's own sins. It's a Q&amp;A Catechism called the ""School of Virtue"" and contains a series of topics. On the topic of truth, the following exchange is noted:

&gt;Q: In what way truth is a potential virtue of justice?

&gt;R: In that a person presents himself as he is in deeds and in words in front of people what he is in himself and before God.
&gt;Q: What vices are opposed to truth?

&gt;R: Lying, simulation or hypocrisy, and arrogance.

&gt;Q: What is lying?

&gt;R: The utterance of a word contrary to that one thinks, with the intention and will to deceive.

&gt;Q: In how many ways is there of lying?

&gt;R: There are pernicious, sarcastic and officious (compliant) lies.

&gt;The first one is with detrimental, the second in relation to our neighbours, and the last is said to please others and ones‚Äô self.

&gt;Q: Is lying a sin?

&gt;R: It is always a sin and in any case is licit. Truth can be hidden, but to lie will never be licit.

&gt;Q: What is simulation or hypocrisy?

&gt;R: Simulation is to present oneself exteriorly with deeds or signs different from what one really is. The hypocrisy adds to the simulation the pretension of one person different from what he is; as being bad person presenting himself as just.

&gt;Q: Which is worse, to be a hypocrite or scandalous?

&gt;R: To be scandalous. The hypocrite lost oneself, and the scandalous lost himself and lost others. There could be a case
where the hypocrite is worse; and it is like those who come to you in sheep‚Äôs clothing but inwardly are ravenous wolves [Mt 7, 15]. In this case it is better that the wolf be discovered as such, that nothing will happen to the sheep.

&gt;**Q: Must an unrighteous person present himself as he is to the
eyes of others?**

&gt;**R: If he is a hidden sinner he would add to his sin one more
scandal. Harmful is to be vicious, but worse is to be declared as
such; and it is an intolerable scandal to boast for being so. The
hypocrite must present himself before God and in his conscience
what he would like to be before others; but not the contrary.**

&gt;Q: What is arrogance?

&gt;R: To present ourselves with words and deeds greater than what one truly is.

&gt;Q: What is irony -pessimism?

&gt;R: Presenting oneself lower than what one is. This can occur in two ways. 1st To save the truth, to keep quiet and say little, but this is not a sin; 2nd It is a fault and vice of irony - pessimism to say despicable things of oneself, not to recognize or to deny greater things that he knows he has.

Sparrows are the most common bird by a massive margin. So unless you think **those evil housecats** are specifically targeting endangered species, then I guess you might expect the most common cat kills on average to be whatever is the most common bird.

Find me a housecat that can take down the big ass chicken sized crows around town and I'd be surprised. Magpies are pretty big and vicious, but maybe some cats would have no problem taking those down. Not that I care about a few dead magpies though.. there's plenty more of them where that came from.

&gt;Cats are not part of the natural ecosystem in Canada, period. Why do you struggle with this?

No struggle here. But the most common bird in North America isn't a native to our ecosystem either. Statistically speaking, most animals cats kill are going to be pests... mice, small birds, etc. Might lose some blue jays in the process which I agree is unfortunate, but hey, that's mother nature. Luckily since blue jays are uncommon, they would be an uncommon victim of cats.

Since you're such a bird activist, I would assume you're just as vocal against wind turbines, right? They kill countless birds of prey (which cat's are unable to kill). So much so that they need to be exempted from laws against killing protected species since they kill so many bald eagles.

When there are animals being tortured for fun on the internet, you can't say you don't feel bad for the animal.

You cannot say that the animal was to blame for any of that. It's just people being assholes. Now I understand that some dogs for instance are vicious, but most domesticated dogs attitude is based on upbringing. No dog is bred to naturally grow up a killer. And if a child is fucking around with a dog, pulling its hair, tail etc. the child deserves a little nip. The biggest problem with the whole animal lives vs human lives, is animals can make a large impact on peoples lives (such as mine for instance) but animals cannot reason with humans, nor talk at all, they don't understand what it's like to be civilized. Just because an animal does not act exactly how people in today's society act does not mean their lives mean any less. An animals instinct is to survive, and if an animal sees someone as a threat, they will do what they can to survive.

"e4rj3bp","I honestly don't think cold blooded murder is outside of Percy's realm of possibility as a character, or any of the demigods for that matter.

The entire premise of the book is dark as hell if you take away the fact that's it's a kid's book. Greek demigods in particular are hunted from the day they are born, usually have tragedy as a cornerstone of their life story, and usually meet a really bloody end, either to a monster hunting them or in the process of some inane bullshit quest from the God's. It makes sense that a demigod that has not had the luxury of the semi-stability Camp Half blood provides would be quick, decisive, and practical when reacting to threats, even if they are much  more powerful than said threat.


Percy and Sally should both have this mindset by the end of The Lightning Thief.


 Sally has had a terrible life. Her parents died when she was five, her uncle didn't really have time for her, and she had to drop out of school to care for him when he died of cancer. She meets Poseidon, due to her ability to see through the mist(and as we know from Rachel Dare, you see some really weird shit if you have this ability), and spends only a short time with him, leaving her pregnant. Then she spends the next twelve years, trying to protect her son from his fate at all costs. Then her fragile stability is crushed by divine scheme involving Percy, she watches a monster almost kill her son, and then she gets abducted by the God of the Underworld before being killed herself.


Then we have Percy. A kid that for all his life has felt powerless. He can't get anything right in school, he can't protect his mom from being abused, and he can't protect himself from Gabe. Then he finds out he's a demigod. A Minotaur ""kills"" his mom, he is blamed for stealing the Master Bolt and the Helm of Darkness, he goes on a dangerous quest full of peril(almost murdered by Medusa, Echidna, and Hephaestus's automatons), literally dives into hell, almost loses his friend to Tartarus, and is unable to save his mother a second time. Oh, and then he fights the personification of war because, surprise, the God's are power hungry dicks that play with mortal lives like children with toys.


Sure, all of this works out in the end, but then it's just back to status quo, except the characters themselves. Gabe is terrible to both him and his mother, then bans Percy from the house entirely. Percy, having been through some mortal mind breaking shit, is willing to murder Gabe right then and there because who is this mere human to present another obstacle to Percy's happiness. He just lost his mother twice and finally regained her, he doesn't want anything or anyone to endanger his mother ever again, let alone some dipshit man who has no power in the grand scheme of the universe.


Sally however stops him, because it's not Percy's place to do that for her. She has also been through some shit, and Gabe still has significant power over her. She can't really save up enough money to outright leave him since he takes all of hers, and his friend is the landlord so who would he probably side with if she tried to kick Gabe out? She's stuck in a toxic relationship that has outlived it's usefulness, she just went through literal physical, mental, and emotional hell and back, and there's a really convenient way out. Gabe just said her son was barred from her house, from seeing her. That he would call the cops on Percy if he ever saw him again. So she takes charge for one time in her life, putting her happiness abo what's ""right"" for just once, and painlessly ends the life of a terrible human being who was more concerned with her life insurance eand his stupid car than her and her son.


It's cold and vicious but not out of character. Percy and Sally are both survivors, they don't allow threats to their and their family's safety and wellbeing to exist, whether the response is warranted or not. We just don't see this very often, as the books focus more on immediate dangers and the more positive side of Percy and Sally.


Gabe is a jerk, but he didn't really deserve death. He just made the mistake of thinking people who have seen more death and tragedy than he ever will are powerless and meek against him. He played stupid games, and won stupid prizes, that's why I don't really feel bad for the character. 

TLDR: Percy and Sally both have some serious mental and emotional damage as characters in Book 1. It looks out of character because we met them at their lowest and they slowly became more stable as people over the next 5-6 years. I also think it's funny that Sally's current lifestyle and happiness can be traced directly back to murdering and selling her husband

"e4bjcol","It's hard to say actually. Both Medellin and Al Qaeda are fairly evenly matched in many qualitative regards. They both had more money than many countries, had arsenals of military hardware, international operatives, and were very brutal.

The only real difference I can think of is the fanaticism of Al Qaeda. The cartels are brutal and vicious but they are at their core big bad criminals. They don't exactly have a motivating cause to die for. Al Qaeda on the other hand were big users of suicide attacks which are very hard to defend against. There was 9/11 of course but they also performed suicide bombings on the regular. The Medellin weren't strangers to terrorism either though. They did blow up that plane and assassinated many government officials.

A unique difficulty for Al Qaeda's standard tactics in this scenario is that the two groups are so different in culture, language and race that it would be very difficult for them to sneak suicide bombers into sensitive areas. The Medellin, being very brutal and lacking any concept of the laws of war would likely have a shoot first policy on anyone who wasn't one of them. Al Qaeda could go for soft public areas and target civilians in Medellin captured territory but Pablo probably wouldn't care if civilians were killed. He was apparently protective of ""his"" people, the poor of Columbia but we are talking about a different country so he wouldn't give a fuck and he was still incredibly brutal to his own anyways.

This poses an interesting problem for Al Qaeda. They and groups like them rely on their opponents having morals. They strike you somewhere that causes bad press and gets people pissed off, eventually political pressure makes you leave. That probably wouldn't work on an opponent with no morals. Really bad guys, like the Medellin or the Nazis for example would just start dragging people out of their homes and shoot them. Can't have suicide attacks if there is no one to suicide.

At that point it comes down to how the more conventional fighting goes and its hard to say. They both had a lot of hardened and experienced killers, plenty of funds and weapons.

"e2qbj5s","&gt;Not everything in Berserk has a bigger, deep dark meaning behind

What are you talking about? Miura's writing almost always symbolic of larger themes or ideas. 

&gt;If her shattered mind had not taken the form of a doll... What form would have it took?

It could have taken on the form of a number of things, as ecass305 pointed out. There's no reason the idea of a shattered soul had to specifically take on the form of a shattered doll, and yet that's how how it was represented. Remember that everything in Casca's mind at that time was a representation of how Casca viewed reality. Guts was an aggressive wounded dog dragging her around in a coffin because, in her perception of him, he's a vicious but loyal person that wants nothing more than companionship and feels chained down by the horrible memories of his past. 

That much is obvious, but Casca being a doll didn't seem as clear, so here's my interpretation: Throughout Casca's life she, like Guts, merely desired companionship. However, as a woman in an time period where women lacked the same respect as men, she was constantly treated as nothing but a sexual object by many. Griffith saved her and wanted her as a warrior, so she tried to suppress any of her own own sexual inclinations or desires and serve as a warrior for Griffith, but she still ended up trying to form a relationship with him only to be struck down. He viewed her as merely an expendable pawn - an object, much in the same way so many men had seen her as a sex object, but she put up with it because he offered her a place to be. Guts came along and he became the first person to see her as more than just an object - he loved her for everything she truly was. He saw her as both a real woman with feelings but also as a formidable warrior to value in battle. 

Just when she was finally beginning to think of herself as more than just an object to be used by others, though, she ended up losing everything she valued, and was deprived of her sense of autonomy. She and her companions were sacrificed by the man that had given her a place to call home, and she was unable to do anything about it, making her identity as a warrior yet again feel null, as if she really was just an expendable object. Then, to drive home that sentiment, she was raped by Griffith, again being the same man that had not only given her a home, but had himself saved her from being raped before. She was objectified yet again, this time as a sex object, and all in front of Guts, the man she loved who acknowledged her identity. 

The point I'm getting across here is that Casca was always trying to take on her identity in her own way - she was trying to own her sexuality, to own her love life, to own her identity as a warrior, but every time these aspects of herself which she wanted to embrace instead became the source of her suffering, manipulated by others to achieve their own ends. The eclipse represented the pinnacle of this, as she was stripped of her dignity and sense of self, rendered a helpless object to be played with by others, like a doll being played with by a child. In the same way that a doll will break if it is played with too roughly, her psyche was shattered after being betrayed and manipulated in the most horrible way possible. 

Of course, Casca ISN'T simply a ""doll."" She's not an object to be used by others, but believes that this is fated to happen to her no matter how hard she tries.

"e2nhxhe","Uhh... yes they did vote for him. All 63 million of them. Every individual voter had a choice no matter what color their state. And they voted for the bizarre deranged guy you acknowledge as a primate. And not just in the general but in the primaries too, where they had other choices in their own party. They actually wanted him. They had a choice to drive the bus over the cliff or not and they stomped on the gas. There isn't any excuse for that. 

And if they couldn't see him for the absurd clown that he was then, and the danger it posed to put someone like that in office from either party, and the national emergency we faced on Election Day, then I restate my point and these people are a serious problem that won't go away when he's gone. 

I watched one of those ""let's ask Trump voters what they think of this Russia meeting"" segments the other day, and the good folk at the diner in bumfuck Indiana or wherever it was were saying things like ""He's done everything right so far."" And your jaw just drops open and you're like WHAT?! And the next segment is at the Winnebago lot at the NASCAR race, where the Confederate flags fly alongside the Trump signs and the NRA sponsor booth and they say things like ""The whites are finally starting to stand up... But I'm not a racist."" 

These people voted for him and still support him. They show up at his rallies. They write to their newspaper's editors. They are real and they are here and they are nuts and we will have to deal with them for the rest of their lives.

"e26lc54","Skulk, the Goblin Rogue. 

First of all I'll note we run a homebrew system based loosely on 3.5 that gives Goblins a climb speed. 

Skulk is a small but lanky goblin with pale red skin, dim yellow glowing eyes and a snaggletooth. He wears a terribly switched dire raccoon pelt with the eyes cut out and the lower jaw removed, so he can wear the head like a hood. 

Skulk is abrasive and vicious but not quick act. His stature and lanky arms allow him to climb much like a monkey, and often have him drifting and swaying like a poorly controlled marionette, which adds to the creepy atmosphere he gives off. When I play him, I speak in the deepest voice I possibly can, and not too loud so people have to pay attention if they want to hear him. When he laughs its more of a dry hack or a sinister snicker and he has been known to hiss or growl in anger, sounding like an angry feline or sometimes a zombie, depending on how loud he gets.
  
Skulk has serious trust issues, having been prey rather than predator for a large period of his life. So, even within the parties he has traveled with he doesn't consider many of them friends. However, the ones he does, he protects with ferocity like that of a mother bear protecting her cubs.

Finally, for weapons his has his trusty ""dagger"" (Small Shortsword) he calls Tooth, as it is in fact that Tooth of a large feline creature sharpened to kill. He also makes good use of firebombs. (molotavs)

His favourite way to start a fight is to leap from the tallest thing he can climb and land on the creature using the velocity to lodge Tooth as deep as he can.

I love this character. He works very well in groups despite his demeanor. He's got so much personality to him that roleplaying with people is always a unique interaction, and he is typically built mechanically sound enough to be a -monster- in combat so he's got some crazy stories to tell.

Goblins can be scary. Really, really scary.

"e1p18z4","Too long of a story.  But to make it short, my build-out contractor screwed me over by not paying his subcontractors, then lied in a legal document saying they were paid, then he filed bankruptcy right after I paid him.  So I had lost over 30k before the doors even opened because I then had to legally pay the subcontractors because they put a lien on my commercial property landlord.  And that, my friend, was only the beginning of a 4 year nightmare of customers and employees stealing, vandalism, sports teams wanting free sponsorships yet they wouldn‚Äôt even support my business, mean customers, ramped racism towards me (I am a white gentile on the border of a Hispanic and Jewish neighborhood, so they hated each other and then they disliked me because of my race.). 
Major littering on property with me being the only business to care.  

My business was an ice cream parlor where I produced my own ice cream from scratch and made it with honey.   My loyal customers claimed it was the best ice cream they ever tasted.  I had a perfect score on YELP with awesome reviews. I am super friendly and I had some really good employees most of the time.   But it didn‚Äôt matter.  How about having a random idiot shutting off my electricity in the middle of the night, losing 100% of my product by the morning?   The switch is outside the building.  There goes 2k worth of ingredients alone spoiled.  That happened twice.  I finally put a lock on the power switch, which is illegal, but I had to.  Had air conditioners stolen for their $30 worth of copper.   Had that happen twice at $4600 each.   And the list goes on and on and on.....    The last straw was when 2 things happened in 1 day.   First, a con artist screwed me out of $1200 fixing a broken freezer compressor and another item that he didn‚Äôt actually fix and then a homeless man wanted to dry his jacket by putting it in one of my air conditioner units.  The fan drew in the jacket‚Äôs drawstring and locked up the fan which burned the motor.  That would have been a $1500 fix.    I was done.  

I actually tried to find where the last contractor lived, but I couldn‚Äôt find him.  I had my Louisville Slugger and it was searching for his two knee caps.   Oh, why?  Because the police wouldn‚Äôt give a shit about any of the crimes against my business.   At all.   I was fed up.  He is lucky I couldn‚Äôt find him.  

So my main lessons unfortunately were that when it came to business, many people lie and steal just to save a penny.   If you must have a brick&amp; mortar business, NEVER be in a shopping center.   There was a common phrase I learned later and it was ‚Äúthe Curse of the Shopping Center‚Äù.  The statistics are way higher for a business to fail in a shopping center over a ‚Äústand alone‚Äù property.  Who would have known this???  Leave yourself a ‚Äúkick out clause‚Äù in your lease agreement where you can terminate your lease before the expiration date if certain conditions are met or not met.  I had a lawyer look over my contract and said it was fine.  What an idiot.   Have a website or social media page so when anyone wants a ‚Äúsponsorship‚Äù or ‚Äúfree gifts‚Äù for a charity run, I can act all excited about it, and explain that they can compete for free stuff by submitting a 2000 word essay on my website on why they should be picked over other teams/charities.  LOL!  Believe me, nobody will take the time for this, they just want the handout without any effort.   You can even do this with advertisers.   You will be bombarded by them.   Make them work for my money and even guarantee an outcome.   Be vicious but fair and honest.  Never lower yourself to their level.  Set all your employee rules in writing and have them sign it.   They must be treated all fairly but with an iron first.  Reward them for good work.  But NEVER be their friend or meet outside of work unless it is work related. There are a lot of Mothers of employees (especially boy‚Äôs Mothers) that are huge pains.  Many are ‚Äúhelicopter mothers‚Äù and treat the boys as if they are babies.   Never engage them, but explain to the kid that she/he works for you, and not their Mother.   The Mother is free to fill out an application if she wishes, but in the meantime, the Mother‚Äôs opinion on anything about the business is irrelevant and will be ignored.  So strange that I never saw this with girls, only boys.      I even told one boy that if his mother ever enters my business again and disrespects me or questions my corporate policy, then he is responsible for her actions and will be fired.  Same goes for jaded lovers and bill collectors.   The employee is responsible for this.   If you cater or protect the employee, it will always end up a bad situation.  
Never allow the homeless to loiter or give them free stuff.   They will end up being around more and you will lose customers as well.  Give all expired food to a local charity and support the community that way.  
Try to be kind and supportive to the local police.   Unfortunately, I was in a major city where it just didn‚Äôt matter.   Too much crime and not enough police force to care.  
I learned to not cater to mean and nasty customers.   It is easier to kick them out and threaten to call the police if they don‚Äôt leave.   My trigger for this would be a threat or the use of any profanity.  Always put steel locked cages around all commercial air conditioners.  Learned that one too late.   Try to not have a back door as that is where most employee and vendor theft happens.  Sometimes employees and vendors work together to steal from you.  Always have top notch security cameras.   NEVER give another employee access to these files.  Even use some fake cameras to save $$$, but only in areas with little security issues.  Gosh, anymore lessons????

Edit- met a guy who said ‚Äúevery successful business is breaking the law in some way.‚Äù   I thought that was not true.   But I started to observe other businesses and now I have no doubt.   Examples- save in taxes by paying employees under the table or not disclosing the cash receipts.  Many hired illegal aliens to save $$$$. 
My neighbor had an electrician place a switch that connected to their electrical meter.  They would shut it off during closed government hours/days so their meter did not run.  My monthly electrical bill averaged $1800/month.  Theirs was $300/month.  
Many would not adhere to employment laws and would not pay overtime, or hire under age kids to do grunge work.

"e1hk51g","Regarding your second paragraph:

This topic comes up in virtue ethics. I *think* it's in the Nicomachean Ethics, but it's been a long time since I've read it directly. In virtue ethics it's not just a split between the virtuous and vicious, but rather there are four states, two between the wholly good (the virtuous) and wholly bad (the vicious): the continent and the incontinent.

The continent person knows the right thing to do, does the right thing, but internally their desires are not in line with virtue. That is to say, they do the right thing but in their minds they really want to be doing the selfish thing.

Next, the incontinent person (the one we're most interested for this conversation), knows the right thing to do, but then they give in to their selfish or unvirtuous desires and do the wrong thing.

Note that for both the continent and incontinent persons, there a conflict between knowing the right thing to do and either the acting or thinking related to it.

I would be incontinent if I, for example, knew it was wrong to kick my dog but kicked my dog anyway. I can even explicitly recognize to myself that it is bad to do these things.

What virtue ethics does with such a person is that it looks for deficiencies in character that would be the reasons for my incontinence. And some of these reasons for failing to be virtuous might be out of my control.

Maybe I kick my dog because I'm intemperate and prone to lashing out in anger. If I have severe anger issues, then it may be the case that I am unable to act in a virtuous way, and I may end up feeling very guilty about this (after all, I'm not wholly vicious). Maybe that does make me a hypocrite. Maybe it makes me weak. But the case is, I still A) believe that not kicking my dog is the right thing to do and B) still kick my dog.

Keep in mind, this doesn't mean that I get an exception pass as you describe in your last paragraph. I'm still being cruel to my dog and will continue to be cruel to my dog. There's no greater good at play. My actions are not virtuous. I know what I ought to do, but an unable.

So, I'd ask you to think about those things people have to deal with as humans that might make them unable to act morally. (In some cases, like if my anger were because of a chemical imbalance, I might be wholly unable to choose the right thing.)

In any case, you can read more about continence and incontinence here: [SEP link](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aristotle-ethics/#VirtDefiContInco)

Because incontinence deals as well with a weakness of will, you can also find it discussed on the page about that concept: [SEP link](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/weakness-will/)

Regarding your third paragraph:

This reads very much like arguments I've heard Peter Singer puts forward about donating.

"e175in5","Great post.

I've much interest in Nezarec. I'm hoping that he becomes an actual figure in the game. What ever Nezarec is, he's truly frightening. He ascended the light and the dark.

Just to draw a parallel with his identity, in many polytheistic religions such as Maya, Aztec, Hinduism and others which Destiny takes ideas from, the idea of complete destruction bearing re-birth is a common theme.

"e0x2zcj","I think it's less that the people who grew up with the prequel films haven't ever been exposed to the Plinkett reviews, and more that they _were_ exposed to the Plinkett reviews, and have developed a vicious _ressentiment_ (in the Nietzschean sense, pronounced French) after seeing their source of fond childhood memories torn apart for, in large part, their objectively terrible flaws.

The older _Star Wars_ fans embraced the Plinkett films so strongly that nobody could speak against them. Prequel fans had to hide their love of them, perhaps even from themselves. That's why you have stuff like the r/PrequelMemes phenomenon. It's using criticism of the prequels' flaws as a cover for a genuine love of them.

In other words, r/PrequelMemes is to prequel fans what capoeira was to black slaves in Brazil.

But more and more lately, we've seen prequel fans who are tired of hiding their passion. They want to display their love of the prequels openly, flamboyantly, without shame. They want to display it _unironically._ Not just in accordance with their natural love of the prequels, but out of hatred for those who made them feel like human garbage for having enjoyed them as children.

I think these guys are throwing out the baby with the bathwater. Are the Plinkett reviews unassailable? No, there are nuances in the story of the creative process that the Plinkett reviews don't cover, but then again the reviews probably wouldn't have been that funny had RLM not been so unfair and vicious. But their basic thesis was correct, I think, and not something that everyone would've realized watching the prequels even if they'd been disappointed in them.

ACIM doesn‚Äôt talk about ‚Äòevil‚Äô the same way there‚Äôs almost nothing in it about sex or money contrary to the Bible or the Quran, simply because Jesus doesn‚Äôt really care about all that, but prefers to emphasize on how to reach salvation

According to ACIM, evil, darkness and demons are illusions the same way a ham sandwich is an illusion, because they are all the same : nothing, it‚Äôs the way to perceive and think about them that give them power over you, or not

So the ego can‚Äôt be evil since it is nothing in the absolute, in itself it is just a way of thinking that opposes God‚Äôs way of thinking in every way, that‚Äôs why it feels very dark and vicious, but if you withdraw any belief in it, the ego just disappears

You have a hard time not believing in fear because you believed in it for eons, for instance it took me months to withdraw any belief in Santa Claus because I believed in him for 7 years as a kid

You feel very afraid of abandonment, being alone in the darkness and so on because you believe in their existence and in their power to attack you, but the minute you realize that they do not exist and can‚Äôt have any influence over you, they disappear 

You are afraid of the ego though it‚Äôs just a bunch of thoughts separate from God‚Äôs thoughts, a smokescreen between you and your Creator, ACIM tells many times that salvation is easy and that the ego is ridiculous, so with time, study and practice you‚Äôll get rid of it

"dz88e1h","I haven't made players cry during DnD, but I *have* made readers cry with my writing before. The first and most important thing is emotional connection. You can have a baby-killing, puppy-eating, virgin-raping antagonist go on a rampage, but that alone won't be sad. That's horrible and vicious... but not sad. Sadness is personal; it happens to someone or something you care about. Old Yeller dying after an entire novel of character development and bonding is sad.

Now, you can't just randomly kill the loved item in question. That's shocking. It'll make the characters mad. Maybe they'll seek vengeance. But, that's not enough to make them sad. It needs to be unfair. The person cannot deserve to die, at least not when it happens. A soldier bravely marching into battle but falling to the enemy is not sad. It's tragic, sure, but not sad. He knew the risks going into battle. However, Old Yeller contracting rabies after *protecting his freakin' family...* now that's sad. That dog deserved a big ol' stake bone and a nice belly rub; instead, he gets put down. That's how to make something sad. 

However, that's still not enough. If you truly want to make something sad, you need to crush hope. There needs to be a way out. There needs to be a plan for survival. If Count Evilbad kidnaps the princess and straight-up murders her, that just lacks impact. There needs to be a struggle, a glimmer of hope, a chance that you can avoid tragedy... but THEN comes the failure. That's how you get the impact that'll be sad. 

A literary example that encompasses this and happens to be the saddest thing I've ever read is a YA novel called *A Monster Calls.* It's about a boy whose mom contracts cancer and as he's trying to deal with it, a monster comes to teach him some esoteric lesson. You get plenty of emotional attachment; the boy's parents are divorced, his father in another freakin' country, so his mother is his entire world. They have a wonderful relationship, and after the diagnosis we see them enjoying what could be their last days together. It's not fair. Nothing good would possibly come of her death, the boy's life will be uprooted, and she didn't do anything to ""deserve"" getting cancer, like smoke or work with dangerous chemicals. Just one day, cancer. Not fair at all. And the hope? Well, there's the chemo, and then hope against hope that this experimental medicine from the Yew Tree will heal her. This medicine *could,* work, or so the boy believes. But, of course, it doesn't. Hope crushed. Sorry kid, mom's gonna die. Oh, and the lesson the monster wanted to teach him? He's gotta just let her go. That was a total kick-in-the-balls shot of tragic reality and it still makes me sad talking about it.

Weed helps me with my recovery process after binging. Anxiety is a given because of the meth withdrawals and can be dark and vicious, but all part of the process.

Some rare times bud creates another psychotic phenomenon that will instill fear which relates to the same embrace of anxiety, which ultimately makes the hallucinations and paranoia worse of course.

"dz5513l","This! I studied traditional fairy tales for my degree and I love some of the older versions. They're bizarre and vicious. But what's really fascinating is that some of them have had male ""heroes"" added in after the fact - for example, Little Red Riding Hood. Most older versions of the story don't have a hunter/woodsman figure who ""saves"" the girl. In fact, in my favorite version, she takes several steps to free herself, runs away, and is later aided by a group of washerwomen when the wolf pursues her. 

eta: The versions we're most familiar with were written down by the literate - i.e., men. But before that, they were passed on orally, and often by women. Sometimes by nurses, mothers, and older sisters telling stories to their children, but also often by seamstresses/cooks/washerwomen who needed entertainment to pass the time during their long working hours. The latter probably had a lot to do with some of the more adult-oriented, female-centric versions of these stories.

eta2: the changes made to folk tales over time actually have just as much, if not more, to do with class as they do with gender.

However, the moment I discovered John, I knew. I had to prove the existence of all these mythical creatures, *and* document it.

Petyr landed on my shoulder. When he was a bat, he communicated telepathically. That's something people didn't know about vampires, much as they didn't know that werewolves didn't need a full moon to shapeshift, or that unicorns are aggressive and vicious creatures.

*There's an enormous depression surrounded by leaves two miles away from our location.*

I eyes Petyr. ""Did you go in?"" John offered me a marshmallow and I devoured it in a single bite.

*No, but it smells of rotten meat and skin. I recognize the succulent scent of dead animals very well. Whatever lays in there, needs a plethora of food.*

""Interesting,"" John said. ""However, maybe that scent could belong to stupid animals that fell and died of starvation.""

*No, something is eating down there. Something big.*

My jumped to my throat. Perhaps, Bigfoot was like mermaids. Common folklore spoke of mermaids as having the size of a human, but in reality they were gargantuan beasts.

My hand moved to the hilt of my sword. ""Have you seen any big traces?""

*No, but it's a start.*

I stood up and whistled. It was our sign to gather and advance together. Ruth came sprinting with a dead squirrel in her mouth. John's bones popped, and morphed. His skin filled with pale-white hairs, and his teeth turned to knives. We were ready.

Soon, we reached the leaves Petyr mentioned. The stench was horrid, not succulent. Vampires had strange tastes. The noises of the forest seemed to have succumbed to the will of silence. As if nothing dared to come close to that area, not even the winds.

""I will go in first,"" I whispered. ""I will yell further commands from below. Ruth, be prepared to take me out if there's nothing in there, and to all of you, be prepared to fight.""

They nodded. The pile of leaves was gigantic, and the depression looked like a bottomless hole. Fuck it. I couldn't die.

I barreled toward the center, fighting and crunching leaves as I advanced. The hole was in front of me. I sprung with the bravery of a man eager to die. If fortune gave me a hand, Bigfoot would be down ther--

I struck something solid, hard as steel, at the rim of the hole, as if an invisible wall was protecting it. A spell? That would be new.

Only that it wasn't.

The ground trembled, and the forest cried. The surrounding trees were obliterated by something, and soon I was a hundred feet in the air, being crushed by an invisible hand, an enormous one.

My bones cracked, and shattered to dust. Then, the monster released me. It made sense now. Bigfoot was invisible. The depression wasn't a depression or a hole, it was his goddamned foot. Had this creature been standing in the same place all his life?

Ruth caught me in the air, leaving a rainbow trail in her wake. Petyr landed on my shoulder again, while Josh frantically attacked the air. Literally the air.

*What do we do?*

My bones regrew, and I breathed deeply. Ruth maneuvered erratically. I unsheathed my sword, but all I found were little vestiges of my beloved weapon.

""I have an idea. Petyr, help John, and distract this beast. Ruth take me back to the bonfire.""

Ruth obliged without a hint of disappointment. She was vicious, but she was smart too. This was a fight we couldn't win.

Soon, we reached the bonfire. I bolted toward my satchel and dug out the book The Seer of the Mist had gave me. It was called: *Myths in the flesh.* When he gave it to me, it had the name of a fantasy creature followed by a bunch of blank pages, and then the name of another creature. I understood my purpose what to complete it.

I dug out my quill and inkwell, and started writing. Trees kept snapping in the distance. We had to duck, for Bigfoot threw one our way. I hoped John and Petyr could hold him long enough.

It took me twenty minutes, but I wrote the basics of Bigfoot. I hoped that would be enough. Then, I left the book back inside my satchel.

""Take me there,"" I said with a grin. ""As soon as I touch the ground, you take Petyr and John back. I have a plan.""

Ruth tilted her head, and I nodded. She knew.

I got on her back, and soon we were back in the fight. John was running at the speed of thunder around Bigfoot's invisible foot. Petyr was hiding amidst the leaves of a tree.

""Go back,"" I yelled. ""It's over!""

Both Petyr and John came barreling back to us.

""What's the plan?"" John asked, panting.

""Leave with Ruth,"" I said. ""This is my fate, old friends.""

They shared a bemused look, and their faces distorted.

*You have finished the book.*

I nodded. ""At last.""

""We will take care of it,"" John said. His bloodshot eyes were glossy. 

A passing tree whirred in our ears. That was their queue. 

They left, but I stayed. It would be my last fight.

And I wasn't going to win.

"dyi9vkp","&gt; Your sources are literally from adoption sites. Clearly biased, they are not only denying pits' natural aggression but also lying saying they are ""good and love love to please"". 

One is from a rescue organization, not an adoption site. They aren't lying, simply stating facts.

&gt; I'll give you some quotes. To assert that Pit Bulls are only aggressive if you train them to attack is to deny the existence of every other behaviour-specific breed on the planet‚Ä¶ try telling a hunter that he paid $10 000 for a finished field pointer that had to be taught to point. He‚Äôll laugh at you!‚Äù ~Gary Wilkes, dog trainer

That's a nonsensical comparison.

&gt; ""When Pit Bulls engage in a fight, far from this inducing an aversive state of mind (most dogs are in a defensive, survival mode during fights), opioids and dopamine are released in their brains making them feel really good - this feeling is so pleasurable that they will often seek out this behaviour again. In the same way that a border collie is built to feel really good when herding sheep, Pit Bulls are built to feel really good when fighting."" ~Taryn Blyth, dog behaviorist and trainer.

But they don't fight all the time. That adrenaline rush they get from it isn't correlated to the feeling you get when you snort a few grams of heroin.

&gt; ""Yeah, but this is a different breed‚Ä¶the power that comes behind the bull dog, pit bull, presa canario, the fighting breed ‚Äì They have an extra boost, they can go into a zone, they don‚Äôt feel the pain anymore. ‚Ä¶ So if you are trying to create submission in a fighting breed, it‚Äôs not going to happen. They would rather die than surrender. If you add pain, it only infuriates them‚Ä¶to them pain is that adrenaline rush, they are looking forward to that, they are addicted to it‚Ä¶ That‚Äôs why they are such great fighters. Especially with fighting breeds, you‚Äôre going to have these explosions over and over because there‚Äôs no limits in their brain.‚Äù ~Cesar Millan.

https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2016/09/pit-bulls-are-chiller-than-chihuahuas/500558/

&gt; My website, Dognition, gathers data on dog behavior by leading paid subscribers through games designed to test their pets‚Äô cognition. Recently, a random sample of people who played the games was asked how aggressive their dogs were in various situations‚Äîtoward people who were new or familiar, children who were new or familiar, and dogs who were either new, familiar, bigger, or smaller. More than 4,000 dog owners responded.

&gt; In almost every measure, out of the 35 most common breeds, Chihuahuas were reported as the most aggressive, especially toward bigger dogs they have not seen before. But before Chihuahua owners start picketing, none of the breeds were particularly aggressive. Chihuahuas peaked out at being moderately aggressive on some measures but were usually on the ‚Äúsometimes aggressive‚Äù end of the spectrum. They only stood out because most other breeds‚Äîincluding pugs, collies and King Charles Cavalier Spaniels‚Äîwere ‚Äúseldom aggressive‚Äù or ‚Äúnever aggressive.‚Äù

https://news.nationalgeographic.com/2016/07/pit-bull-ban-aggressive-dog-breed-bronwen-dickey/

&gt; **From 2005 to 2015, pit bulls killed 232 Americans, about one citizen every 17 days. They are banned in the United Kingdom and several other countries. Shouldn‚Äôt they be banned here?**

&gt; No. The first thing I did when I was consulting this book is reach out to the experts in the animal sciences to talk about what‚Äôs going on with these incidents and how best to prevent them. Fatalities are incredibly rare. In the U.S., we have 320 million people and between 77 and 83 million dogs. So your chance of being killed by any type of dog in the U.S. in any given year is one in 10 million.

&gt; People who have studied these cases, like Jeffrey Sacks at the CDC, have shown that when it comes to fatalities caused by pit bulls, the breed identifications are often not accurate. The title ‚Äúpit bull‚Äù has expanded so dramatically over the years that people are lumping any dog with a large head and short coat into that category rather than separating out each of the pit bull breeds.

https://www.onegreenplanet.org/animalsandnature/5-reasons-why-pit-bulls-are-misunderstood/

&gt; ‚ÄúPit bull‚Äù is actually a generic term applied to various breeds including the American Pit Bull Terrier, American Staffordshire Terrier, Blue Blood Bulldog, Dogo Argentino and hundreds of mixed breeds of similar physical appearance. Therefore, the term ‚Äúpit bull‚Äù often designates how a dog looks and not a breed itself, typically leading to a larger degree of misplaced blame on these dogs.

&gt; Pit bull dogs are not born ready to rip into another dog, animal or human being. They are trained to fight by people who are interested in making a profit and providing ‚Äúentertainment‚Äù in the form of a dog fight. [...] It is then not the dogs who are cruel and vicious, but rather those behind their training.

&gt; Pit bulls are not inherently dangerous. Like any other dogs, they can become violent, aggressive and mean through a lack of training, abuse, neglect and irresponsible ownership and breeding as well as a lack of attention to health and temperament issues. If they are treated with respect and trained properly, pit bulls will exhibit little to no negative traits (just ask a loving pit bull adopter!)

&gt; In fact, according to the American Temperament Test Society, American Pit Bull Terriers, the most popular breed used in dog fights, have a very high temperament passing rate of 82.6 percent. Even dogs commonly thought to be kind and gentle (and they are, with the right care) like Bearded Collies and Chihuahuas scored lower than American Pit Bull Terriers.",1525555855,"it is then not the dogs who are cruel and vicious, but rather those behind their training.  &gt; pit bulls are not inherently dangerous.","cruel and vicious","vicious",NA,FALSE,"cruel and vicious","cruel",NA,NA,0

"dy2zc5h","&gt;Yes, I think that's about right. One way to read the Groundwork is to say that we can discover our duties in a few different ways.

I thought that would be the case (as in, not only using the CI as diagnostic test), as the CI really seems to be used to simply tell us what not to do directly, and only what we may or ought to do indirectly after seeing that a maxim yields negative results for both tests. But to be honest, I am not exactly clear on the method of directly establishing a ""positive"" imperfect duty (but a positive perfect duty, I imagine, is simply the negation of a negative perfect duty: if one may not ignore the needs of a ""ward,"" in the most general sense, then one must or ""shall"" tend to the needs of their ward with whom they are charged with a special duty). 

I know Kant explicitly states that we have the end-duties of self perfection (or, perhaps, ""improvement"") and seeking (or maintaining, or both?) the happiness of others, and never the reverse in any direct sense. But I'm hazy as to how he got those end duties. What I know is that many imperfect duties simply ""fall under"" these end duties. Cultivating ""humanity"" would be a form of self perfection, acting in accordance with it would be a form of seeking the happiness of others (he says ""neighbors,"" I think, which i assumed might be quite relevant in terms of the strength of obligation to others).

&gt;This might work, but it seems inefficient since no maxim can pass the CIW test and then fail the CIC test. 

Right, sorry. That's what I was attempting to imply by saying ""[more wisely]."" My stance is that it is technically most proficient to start with the CIC test, which is why I was talking about ""getting results in half the time only after getting positive results from a preliminary CIC test."" 

Basically, it seems we're on the same page to this extent, that if we can run a CIC test and we get positive results back, we save ourselves the trouble of a CIW test- but where i thought we were diverging was my suggestion that we can do this partially because all CICs are CIWs, analogous to the way all human beings are animate beings (animals in the philosophical sense)- though, naturally, it is wholly inappropriate to refer to CICs as mere CIWs, just as it is entirely inappropriate to refer to human beings as if they were mere animals, e.g., when those of a scientismic persuasion say, ""we're just animals."" (My answer: Well, no, we're not- not unless you're purposely being obtuse and entering into a completely different language game in which ""animal"" and even ""human"" specifically refer to sorts of terrestrial organism in our socially constructed, biological-taxonomic scheme, which is entirely irrelevant to ethics, really- this confusion likely being the root of your insistence that human beings aren't a special kind of animal.)

&gt;I'm not totally sure I follow what you mean here. If you think that the maxim fails the CIC test, then the CIW test cannot even really be run distinctly. 

Okay. I'll admit: I was under the impression that ""if you failed to find any *contradiction* between the maxim and the enjoinder to treat (regard, respect, conceive of) humanity purely as an end in itself"" (i.e. ""that if there were no positive results from the CIC test""), you would then move on to see if there were any contrariety between the maxim and that enjoinder. If the maxim entails treating humanity as both mean and end at once, then you have discovered a maxim which will pass the CIC test, but not the CIW test. 

CIWs are not perfectly impermissible to act upon, nor are the actions based upon them naturally unlawful. One might (but never may or ought to) act upon a CIW, but never a CIC. By ""might,"" it is meant ""imperfectly may,"" or in other words, the act would be vicious but lawful- nobody could rightly stop you (compel you to stop with external force), or punish you for it, etc., yet it would still be a matter of internal self compulsion for you to not do it, i.e., you ought not, but not may not do it.

So, my example was smoking pot just to get stoned out of your gourd. You are treating the humanity in yourself as both mean and end through self stupefication. Therefore, you absolutely shouldn't do it, but it is not something another (or, i imagine, the government) can rightly force you not to do. Similarly, charity is not something that can be externally compelled, but not giving when you easily can is extremely vicious. It's wrong, but you can't be punished for being greedy within lawful terms.

I suppose i would take this as far as saying, for an extreme example,  that you could never justly be externally compelled to save a drowning child with whom you're not charged of care, nor would you be worthy of punishment for literally watching a stranger's baby (technically, any baby that was not in your care) drown in a bucket- but such abstinence from action would be so incredibly, highly vicious, especially in the latter case, that you would be a quite abominable and morally disgusting human being for not doing anything, and worthy of a quite great shame (perhaps proportionate to the ease with which you could have helped). I think the point here, though, is that such inaction is not *unjust* (and therefore couldn't properly be termed *neglect*, as when you are charged with the care of a ward in some special sense, and derelict from that perfect duty). 

If I were forced to draw a distinction in terms (of the way i understand Kant)- the rich, who could easily help, do not *injure* others [not in their care] by abstaining from helping them (though there is, of course, the matter of whether their wealth was licitly obtained or not, but I digress), and it is therefore not injustice. But perhaps we could call this ""unfair"" - or some form of ""qualified injustice,"" and at any rate, they do injury to humanity in genere by not helping. 

As the saying goes, it is easier for a camel to pass though the eye of a needle than it is for a rich man to pass to the kingdom of God (though I'm not a Christian and probably totally butchered that), and I'm sure Kant was bearing in mind such Christian sorts of saying for his ethical efforts. (Right?)

&gt;This means that any justification for rape isn't just non-rational, but nonsensical. 

Let me see if I'm understanding your distinction correctly here: x is reasonable (rational) if it is perfectly permissible, and x is imperfectly permissible if it is ""sensical"" or ""sensible,"" these latter being matters of degree, unlike reason (because practical activities we would call sensible are neither reasonable nor unreasonable). 

In other words, all merely vicious activity is to some extent sensible, no matter how small the degree. Smoking pot just to get stoned is quite sensible (something one might do) in the grand scheme of things- because you're not really hurting anyone or anything - but still fails to be *reasonable* (something one may do), yet isn't unreasonable; whereas letting a person, with whom you're not charged of care, drown, when you could easily help them, is so utterly lacking in sense, that it is virtually indistinguishable from  ""senseless"" (and a fortiori *un*reasonable) activity, so much so that it appears to be unreasonable. In fine, pot smoking and abstinence from saving a non ward when you easily could, actually exist on the same spectrum (there's probably a better word), and they are only separated by a matter of the degree to which they are imperfectly reasonable.

Is that correct, or no?

At any rate, my take is that rape could never not yield a positive result in the CIC test- it would always be flagged. 

What I'm trying to say (but failed) is that if it were the case that not all CICs were implicitly CIWs, it would be quite strange. It would be like saying that that which terminates the flow of water doesn't at the same time frustrate its flow (though we could say that that which frustrates its flow doesn't terminate it).  Likewise, I take Kant to be saying that where acting upon CIWs frustrates the progress of good (""flow of water""), acting upon CICs brings the progress of good to a stand still, instead of just frustrating its efforts, so to speak.",1524863424,"by ""might,"" it is meant ""imperfectly may,"" or in other words, the act would be vicious but lawful- nobody could rightly stop you (compel you to stop with external force), or punish you for it, etc., yet it would still be a matter of internal self compulsion for you to not do it, i.e., you ought not, but not may not do it.","vicious but lawful","vicious","but",FALSE,"vicious but lawful","lawful",NA,NA,1
"dy29yaw","&gt;No, I don't see why this is so.

My reasoning was that it would seem prima facie ""obvious"" that any wrong that would be considered a CIC (""perfect wrong,"" let us say) would also necessarily be a CIW (""imperfect wrong""). 

The thing i got from Kant was that he seems to divide between right and wrong- but then within wrong, he divides between what one could call perfect and imperfect wrong- the former are ""un-universalizable,"" i.e. contradictories [of right] which stand in real opposition to right, but the latter are ""non universalizable"" contrarities [of right] which don't stand in real opposition (real repugnance) to right.

An imperfect wrong (CIW) is vicious - immoral but not unjust. A perfect wrong (CIC) is both immoral and unjust. Injustice is a part of ethics (and not technically an extension of theoretical reason like politics, diplomacy, and other ""rules of art"" or ""precepts of skill"" which come from studying nature). Again, this is because Kant does not take ethics to be synonymous with morality - morals and jurisprudence are the two ""grand stems"" of ethics. 

In other words, right and wrong are general ethical terms for Kant, but vicious and virtuous are specifically moral terms, and just and unjust are jurisprudential terms. All injustice (in terms of natural law) is vicious. If injustice is naturally unlawful, then viciousness is ""unnaturally lawful."" In the end, both are unfit for universal legislation because both fail to be perfectly right.

E.g., absolutely no vicious activity to a non human could ever be a CIC. If you deceive your dog about going to the park to get him to the vet, you have acted upon a CIW. It is wrong, but specifically only vicious. On the contrary, if you make a legal contract with someone but have no intention to keep this contract, you haven't just acted immorally, but specifically unjustly. By contrast, if you merely deceive someone with no legal title to a performance, then you've only acted viciously, not unjustly. To make this technically correct: you've acted upon a vicious but not unjust maxim. In other words (and to use constructive metaphors like Kant, where here we're speaking of act tokens like buildings we choose to enter upon, and their maxims like blue prints which we determine are safe enough to proceed with and enter upon through act construction), if viciousness is lacking in ethical safety (""not safe but not unsafe""; lacking integrity; ethically dangerous *to some extent*, but not outright perilous), then injustice is out and out ethically *un*safe (devoid of integrity; ethically perilous). 

(I could imagine many modern kantians disagreeing, because [my interpretation of] Kant's standard for ethical safety was extremely high. For example, if a sex act is consensual, that only means it's not *un*just, i.e., in real opposition to justice- not that it is not ""not just but not unjust,"" i.e. in mere contrariety to justice. For further example, all sexual self gratification is a CIW for Kant, but not a CIC. It's not naturally unlawful (""not lawful as a matter of course""), but for Kant, whatever simply fails to be naturally lawful, i.e. even what is simply unnaturally lawful (""lawful, but not as a matter of course"") is wrong.)

Edit: oh, and to tie this to my last reply: CICs are specifically injurious to humanity in particular (and humanity *in genere*, hence my claim about CICs being a species of CIW), but CIWs are only injurious to humanity *in genere*. I'm also working with the assumption that Kant thinks it is impossible for an agent to injure themselves in particular.

Lastly, if we look at the CI as a practical diagnostic tool of sorts, we can think of it as having two settings. The first test it runs is the CIC test, which doesn't cast as wide of a net as the CIW test. If the CIC test is run upon a maxim and the results come back negative, then it is not the case that you [normatively] *may not* act upon that maxim - i.e. that it is unlawful. 

But even then, this screening is not enough for Kant. On the other setting, the CIW setting- which casts a broader net- if the results come back positive, then it is the case that you *ought not* to act upon that maxim, but not that you *may not*. 

The CIC test is run to catch injustice- and the CIW test is run to catch viciousness. One [normatively] ""might"" (""imperfectly may,"" if you'll allow me the peculiar use) act upon a CIW, but it's never the case that one ""might"" act upon a CIC. By ""imperfectly may,"" I mean not that it is right, but only that one is unnaturally lawfully entitled to do it. For example, smoking pot just to get high isn't naturally unlawful, but it also isn't naturally lawful, given that it is a clear abuse of the purported medicinal properties of the plant. In other words, it is vicious to smoke pot to catch a high, but not unjust. Ingesting marijuana for medicinal purposes is naturally lawful- and if the motive (will spring) is not mixed up with any degrading heteronomous motives, then and only then is the act ""supernaturally lawful,"" i.e. it's lawful beyond a matter of course because the agent has completely perfect motive in ingesting the medicine out of duty (and here we finally have the division of perfect and imperfect right - where imperfect right is naturally lawful activity [activity with good form, i.e. built upon a universalizable maxim] sans proper motive).",1524841264,"in other words, right and wrong are general ethical terms for kant, but vicious and virtuous are specifically moral terms, and just and unjust are jurisprudential terms.","kant, but vicious","vicious","but",TRUE,"vicious and virtuous","virtuous",NA,NA,1

"dxiqlsi","IANAL but I work as an ACO in CA. The dangerous dog laws might be similar. I can explain our process and it might mirror your state, but you‚Äôd have to directly contact your AC agency or look up your local laws.

Firstly, the police don‚Äôt always know Animal laws. So don‚Äôt take legal advice from them. Our police departments often call us to get info on animal laws.

Personal injury situations like yours are civil claims, and I would not hesitate to speak to a lawyer ASAP. They would give you advice on who you would file against, but most certainly the dog owner would be named. I‚Äôve never had my department named in a civil claim for a dangerous dog, but I suppose your lawyer would give the best advice. 

If the last time the dog was returned to the owner it was labeled ‚Äúdangerous‚Äù, which is what I think I‚Äôm reading in your post, it means that your AC department took the dog for a vicious hold, likely due to past incidents, and there was a hearing or a trial and the overseeing judge or hearing officer listened to all the testimony and went through all the evidence and moved to deem the dog vicious, but did not move for destruction(or in other terms, to have the dog euthanized). AC departments don‚Äôt make the calls on that in my experience. We often get blamed for dangerous dogs returning to owners, but we are following our legal process written out in state and city statutes. If the dog was already deemed dangerous and returned to the owner and another incident occurs, the dog will likely be euthanized, as the owners are required to sign paperwork understanding and agreeing to those conditions when a judge or hearing officer have been kind enough to return the dog to its home. 

All that paperwork is a matter of public record and will be available when requested by your attorney, and your attorney will decide if the paper trail shows any negligence on Animal Control‚Äôs part, which seems unlikely since they did have the dog deemed vicious, but I suppose not impossible. 

Does it seem crazy that an aggressive dog has been returned to the owner? Does it seem ridiculous that it sometimes takes several vicious incidents to even get a dog deemed dangerous? Does it seem ridiculous that a dog deemed dangerous has one more shot at a vicious incident before it can legally be euthanized by Animal Control? The answer is yes to all of it. But there is a lot of steps and hurdles AC has to take, and owners have a certain amount of protections for their property.

My best guess is the prior incidents didn‚Äôt result in any extreme injury. If your incident was the first vicious incident involving that dog, I can say that, at least at my agency, the dog would either be deemed vicious and destroyed and not sent home, or the owners would be overly encouraged to surrender the dog for euthanasia to avoid holding the dog for months while the vicious hearing proceeds.

"dxgj4ys","&gt; You could cut out Bravo, Marika, Hase, and Junoichi and nothing of value would be lost. Same for that other Rider that was friends with Baron.

I greatly disagree. They serve to make the world more organic, showing that there were more dance groups fighting for territory than just Team Gaim and Team Baron. 

For example, with Hase and Junoichi, they were people that Kaito picked on after he got his Rider powers, seizing their stages almost immediately and mocking them because he thinks they're weak. Eventually, Kaito targets Micchy, and Kouta shows up to rescue him from the summoned Inves. Hase and Junoichi gain rider belts, and proceed to overpower Kaito and are on the verge of defeating him straight out until Micchy and Kouta show up to rescue Kaito. 

This all sets up several things that are relevant later:
 
* It demonstrates the value of bonds and alliances with others in a way that would be harder to illustrate with with fewer riders: We can understand when Kaito attacks Micchy that Kouta will join in, and since they're both ""Main"" riders, you'd expect Kaito to lose. But Kaito, a Main rider, against two Joke riders and he loses badly?
* It puts Kaito, who was a bit of a dick to everyone, in a debt to Kouta, which sets him up as a sort of Vicious but Honorable rider. He seeks to crush the weak, having picked on Micchy, Hase and Junoichi in the previous episode, but now has to accept that he has to be more careful going forward.
* It establishes Kouta as being a forgiving type that values kindness over retribution
* It establishes that, in the eyes of the characters, no one is so powerful that they can't be overpowered by any other team. Team Gaim's only real advantage at this point is just that they have two riders, which is just an advantage in numbers alone. Team Baron and Team Gaim can't just bash it out now, or the alliance of Team Wild and Invitto might pick off whoever's left.
* I would need to rewatch the episode, but I think it also helps to establish Micchy's character, as he goes in more to help Kouta than because he wants to really save Kaito. 

The feelings of Micchy's general feeling of inadequacy and subversive nature also come through later, as he is shown to be lying and stealing lockseeds (The Watermelon Lockseed) from his brother in order to benefit Kouta in Kouta's fight against Oren/Bravo later in the episode.

It helps to flesh out character motivations and interactions, as well as expanding the setting in an organic way early on. World building is important, as these help separate the background dressing characters (Like Kouta's sister, or Mr. Bandou) from the active members (Like Ryoma, Sid, Hase or Oren), and as the series progresses, you then see the Main Characters then begin to distinguish themselves as their ideals become tested. The weak willed ones, like Hase (who dies after succumbing to the Inves fruit) or Junoichi (who is too afraid to be alone, and has to join in an alliance with Oren) stay at their basic form of power, while people that take risks and want the power to rule get much stronger

Zack becoming a rider was there to help humanize Kaito: it showed that Kaito cares deeply for his friends, and felt an obligation to let them have a shot at becoming strong for themselves instead of relying on him. It makes Kaito a more developed character by showing that he's not purely obsessed with only power. Even in the ending arc, when he becomes Lord Baron, he's still shown to maintain some sense of Friendship to Team Baron; he realizes that he's reaching the point where he soon will have enough power to start reforming the world as he wants, and gives Zack the chance to betray his allies (Girdon and Bravo) and join him, or risk being crushed along with them. After which, Kaito is shown to let his guard down and still regard Zack as a close friend, which nearly results in him dying if it weren't for Marika leaping in to save him.

Marika is another one that helps flesh out other characters. It shows that Takatora has accidentally surrounded himself with corrupt people, so even though Yggdrasil may be interested in saving lives (and he's the head of that), the people under him are secretly undermining him. Marika is a rather developed character for a background unit, but one thing she shows is that Kaito isn't alone  in his quest to watch the world as it is be destroyed. She likes power and powerful men, and as the series develops, she sees that Kaito is clearly a power player, and she abandons Ryoma to aid him instead. It certainly illustrates that there are people that would be on board with Kaito's plan, and that there will be a fair number of people that may indeed survive and even thrive (such as Marika) under his rule.

_____________________________________________

I already feel like I've typed out way too much. but yeah. The riders all mostly did stuff. and by the end of the series, they gave a clear reason why the minor riders weren't helping anymore: They literally couldn't. Either through injury / defeat (like Zack or Oren) or death (Marika or Sid).

&gt; Makoto still did a good job of filling the role that most secondary Riders fill: backup in fights and someone who can also fight if the villains are doing multiple things at once.

Except, he really didn't. After the Gammaizers began showing up in force, he was nullified like Necrom, and reduced to ""Punching Bag."" He was little more than a distraction to anyone that actually mattered to the story. He couldn't really fight Alain's older brother, the Gammaizers nullified his attacking power, and he had no alternate forms to use because he gave them to Takeru for a bizarre reason, because Takeru didn't really need or use them in the end. 

Again: Necrom and Specter, at the end of the show, were fighting an unimportant mob of grunts while Takeru, who had every weapon, every form (and wasn't even using any of them), and all the power in the story actually fought the villains. Specter and Necrom were so weak that Genm had to intervene and wiped out all of the Ganma with his sports Gashat and bike.",1523895245,"* it puts kaito, who was a bit of a dick to everyone, in a debt to kouta, which sets him up as a sort of vicious but honorable rider.","vicious but honorable","vicious","but",FALSE,"vicious but honorable","honorable",NA,NA,1

We have just abominably undemocratic institutions at every level and in every branch of government.

I don't think Brian was wrong about Reddit.  This place can get pretty negative and vicious but there are some really really cool places here full of really awesome people.  There are places with awesome pictures and fantastic stories and places where people who have no one to talk to IRL about problems can find folks just like them.  There are places you can go when you're sad or depressed or lonely and someone will always respond and offer you their hand.  There are places of fantasy and wonder and darkness and terror and all of those places are full of passionate people that will not forget the hooman behind the screen.  It's so easy to see all of the negative stuff all the darkness, but there's even more light fighting back against it and trying to make this a wonderful place to meet with others.

Brian's quips and the jokes on G&amp;S and the community here are one of those amazing places that I feel very lucky to be apart of and to have found.  I'm literally rewatching the episode last night at 9 AM just to find the little tidbits that will be clattering through my head and making me snicker with glee while my co-workers stare at me with raised eyebrows.  Thankfully the Bachelor AFTR was on last night so they're probably just going to blame the wine.

I may have inhaled my frosted flakes when /u/BrianWayneFoster started doing a summary of all the stupidity that went down on the Bachelor.  Light of the stars that was so good and I would love to watch quick recaps by him of the episode, spot on and hilarious.  Also the idea of a Nerd Bachelor series does sound kind of fun but I feel it might be rather difficult for G&amp;S to pull off because they're not exactly Pure Fucking Evil like the Producers over at ABC are.  I mean a clean honest to goodness straight down the barrel to mission statement Bachelor show where people are actually nice to each other and are trying to find love, but with nerds?

First of all, in his game there was no afterlife. When you die you get sent to the void. His BBEG was able to bring back dead souls as living creatures, usually in different forms. The problem is that his influence spreads among the living with these disgusting Stirges. When they bite people, they infect them to the point where they'll eventually turn into them. Really gross shit. One of the NPCs was turning this way. Slowly she got more rabid and vicious, but remained ""good"" thanks to her husband.

And then he died, and she died after, and we kinda really needed them alive, and I was insistent on reviving them. But no, this was a special campaign. Sure we could revive him and his wife... But it would have to be in new bodies. So we had to pay someone to kidnap what we HOPED would be evil people and restore their minds in the new bodies.

I had to take a 8 week hiatus once. When I returned to the game, I was informed that my character was missing her eye. Great. Where is it? Oh, apparently there's a doppelganger of me running around.

And then... He shoved a tube down her throat, cast a ritual and kicked her overboard. What. The. Fuck. Well, karma caught up to him later but still, we never really let that go.

You have to give her time. She already showed signs of being heading into that directions with all her plans she has done so far.
Remember there was peace in the beginning with Aerys before it slowly started to go downhill with him. 
And it started peacefull. With her nothing ever started peacefull. She actually put more oil on the fire with her putting Joffrey on the throne. Her intents are already clear from the start before she even sat the throne or adviced her kids.

I wouldn't credit her to much for her forming alliances and making a deal with the iron bank.

Cause she doesn't follow the usual means. She took the throne by conquest and is holding it untill someone overthrows her. Also she has Qyburn as her hand.

&gt;sharia this... sharia that...

let me tell you a little story about Sharia Law, in the country with the largest Muslim population in the world Indonesia, there's a Province/State named Aceh.

Aceh is very much Muslim Majority, and they voted to use Sharia Law for Muslims and let the people who are not Muslims to use the Indonesian Law (which is based on Colonial Dutch Laws).

the funny thing is that many of the non Muslim who have broken the Law elected to be punish in accordance to sharia law, why is this?     

in Sharia Law they don't do a lot of prison time, crimes like petty thief, brawl fight, violence are dealt with ""Barbaric"" [lashing Punishment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_W21RNZbInU&amp;t=222s&amp;has_verified=1) instead of the ""civilized"" incarceration, beside wanting to avoid prison time with sodomites, most people actually have jobs and some have family to support, if they were incarcerated for even one month, two months they might lose their jobs, so they elect to receive these sort of barbaric punishment.

How many pedophiles repeat their crimes after receiving the Civilized punishment? is there any use for keeping a mass murderer in life sentence or 20 years sentence? if you've seen the ""Shawshank redemption"" you'll be able to imagine the difficulties of re-joining the society, and it puts great burden to the tax payer, not to mention this only benefits the Prison Complex INDUSTRY

Since he never gave a name, he was known as the stranger. Eventually, people shortened the name and took to calling him Strange. Strange lived alone in a rickety shack not too far from the shoreline. Despite his unsettling aura, the villagers of Morwick tolerated and were courteous to him. Then Dill Wice disappeared.

Dill had been out camping with his friends, and had taken a moment to excuse himself from the campfire to relieve himself. Hours passed, and he didn't return to the warm flame. The other boys began to worry, and one headed into town to alert the adults. Soon, the village was roused and search parties were formed. The people searched all night and into the morning, but they found nothing.

Finally, a searcher, one of the boys that had been camping with Dill, called out. He'd found Dill's jacket. It was only a few hundred yards from the shack were Strange lived. The sheriff of the village arrested Strange, and searched his home. They found nothing, and Strange denied seeing the boy. In the minds of the villagers though, Strange was guilty. His odd nature was glaring evidence to that.

A few days later, in the dark of the night in a heavy fog, they formed a mob and marched to Strange's home. They drug him out, beat him, and hung him. Justice was had, so they all thought. But foul things were at work. Some say it was the blood of Strange seeking vengeance, others say it was a curse that was on him. Strange was always the cause of the horror though.

A few nights after his death, another heavy fog rolled in. There was something different about this fog though. Black and heavy like tar, it covered the entire village. A few houses on the outskirts, heard screams and wails. It was as though the voices of the damned were in the mist, crying out for mercy and destruction. Those out of the fog hid in their homes, shivering in fear and waiting for the night to end, terrified to investigate.

The next morning, the village was empty. No property was destroyed, no goods missing. Everything looked normal, just no people. There were stray dogs and cats that had turned feral and vicious, but they were all that remained of the inhabitants of Morwick.

The town has since become a ghost town, no one willing to move in and claim it. Those who lived near but were spared even moved away. They claimed that once every one or two months, a thick fog would roll in at night, and voice could be heard, weeping and whispering to one another.",1513185290,"there were stray dogs and cats that had turned feral and vicious, but they were all that remained of the inhabitants of morwick.","feral and vicious","vicious",NA,FALSE,"feral and vicious","feral",NA,NA,0
"dr2u9qn","I was a fat kid all through middle school and high school. My parents got divorced when i was six and i had to move with my mom. We moved a lot after that and i had to switch schools twice. I ate my emotions cause my world was so drastically changed. 

I was picked on all through out middle school and high school for my weight. By high school i was around 270 at around 6‚Äô0.  Being bullied hurt a lot and made me feel bad about myself. I learned to not just sit and take it I had to stand up for myself. When kids picked on me about my weight I would come back with something about them. If someone pushed me I pushed backed, even though I was fat I wasn‚Äôt defenseless.

In all honesty it taught me about the world and that things aren‚Äôt fair, people can be mean and vicious.  But you don‚Äôt have to be a victim you can stand up for yourself and fight back. Pushing back stopped people from picking on me because I wasn‚Äôt a easy target anymore. Sure sometimes I got in fights and lost but thats life, you fail all the time.  It gave me confidence in myself that I would not have if I left it to somebody else to fix. 

After high school i taught myself about exercise and diet and i took responsibility for my bad eating habitats and lost about 90 pounds. It took nine months but damn did i feel good after it.

 Therefore I would say make a federal carry law as it should be constitutionally and then allow cities and maybe even states to opt out on a case by case basis. Would this be agreeable with you?

"dqpdrzv","Hello I'm super late to the party but I was at a no-phone-reception camp on the weekend, and hoping you still check this! I feel that many on this team may work on the next Darkin, and I'm really excited about that. I'm not sure if you have plans already, but I just want to give some ideas that you might not have considered (although I suppose these are fairly unoriginal).

1) There is no whip champion in League. Tbh I hope that a whip champion isn't a/the female Darkin as that's more cliche, and I really hope that if you do a male champion who uses a whip he is a really flirtatious *single* male youth who is lithe. Opportunities! (I understand Rakan was meant to help with this, he does, but he's taken). 

2) Symbiotic relationship. I like with Rhaast and Kayn you choose the outcome/ in the process of corruption. Varus is essentially already corrupted... Kinda. I don't know your plans on Aatrox...  it would be good to have someone completely corrupted, but I'm more interested in a Darkin who pities/admires their human host. Like around the other Darkins they pretend to be in control, but they willingly exchange control depending on the situation, but it takes time to adapt. I suppose with the female Darkin, I could see her being super blood thirsty and vicious, but she has a Shurima host body who is naturally timid and shy, and the Darkin feels very protective of her. That way it could be very enjoyable to see the juxtaposition. Another concept is that the human is completely in control and abuses/traps the Darkin. I guess this is already covered by assassin Kayn. 

3) 4th world problems (the virtual world). This isn't a suggestion, but just something on my mind. My complaint feels very petty, as the LGBT minority has many more struggles than I, and I'm glad that Riot took these steps to introduce a homosexual couple. However as a female gamer, I've praised the male attractivity of these three champions/skins: Ezreal, 5th age Taric, and Heart seeker Varus. Ezreal was the only ""anime"" like guy who appealed to my immature crushes on fantasy arrogant males, 5th age Taric is seducing the viewer (he is not physically attractive, but the ACT is, which is much more important) and the Heart seeker Varus skin was the most attractive male skin splash that was* flirty and hot*. He was angelic, posing, and not wearing much (giggle). I still view them as attractive, but I feel like I am not their intended audience and do not want to intrude on that. I've spent many hours listening to guys rant about assets on the seductive female *poses* (e.g. Kitty Kat, classic mf and Frost Blade Irelia), and I just really crave splash arts which ARE flirtatious to a female audience besides raw muscle. Whenever I have complained about a lack of flirty male champions to my gaming community, the response is usually ""you're a minority"" or ""at least there is heart seeker Varus!"". 

I don't think it's right to say ""heart seeker Varus is for all audiences"", even though it is a different ""skin universe"". Keep his sexuality. My suggestion is please, please make more seductive splash arts for a female audience. I'm talking about splashes with male champions standing in the rain, intense gazes, leaning against a door frame, looking wounded but earnest to protect, etc. ""Vulnerable but determined"". Talon is a pretty good place to start if you want to use old champions.

"dqcmzqf","As a contextual statement, the world of Aecclias does in fact contain a single actual Deity, while also containing several fictional deities. While many beings are called Gods, proclaim themselves as Gods, and would be considered Gods in other settings. There is a very strict definition of God for the world of Aecclias. To be a God. You must be all powerful, all knowing, and beyond all logic. While this one true God is in fact worshiped, it is worshiped as a false version, meaning the religion itself has no actual basis or knowledge of this being. 

This one supreme being possesses no real name, no real form, and no domain. Because why should it? It is all powerful, all knowing, and beyond all things mortal. It holds no love or hatred, nor anything else in its being. Because emotions are beneath it, to feel emotions would mean it'd be mortal. Its logic is incomprehensible, a single glimpse into its ""mind"" would condemn a person to total nonexistence as if they never existed in the world before. This supreme being never interacts with mortals, for it rests silently within a place that exists everywhere and nowhere. Long ago It was betrayed by those closest to it, countless of its own divine creations. With their full might, they did absolutely nothing. Yet it decided to sleep, finding such an event interesting. Even to this day, countless of billions of trillions of eons have passed, and it half-sleeps gazing upon the world. 

Now onto the actual religion. Take in mind this religion has little to nothing correct about it, like most religions in Aecclias. This religion, the single largest united religious body in the world, is called The Faith of One Truth. This is the religion that the vast majority of Humanity follows. 

The Faith of One Truth was founded by a man named Augustus Lupis, who proclaimed himself under the new Lar Servatius (First Servant). When he was but a young man he encountered three beasts that belonged to a race that become known as Angels. Angels are chimera beasts with the body of a bird of prey, the leathery wings of a bat, the wolf-like head of a deer, and the horns of a stag. Vicious but strangely intelligent, Angels will kill for fun and sport. He encountered not one, but three fully grown Angels, and he walked away not only alive but with them as his companions. With these three beings at his side, Lar Servatius I began gathering a large community of people. His small community went from a handful of people, to a hundred, to thousands. He founded and built with his own hands a great chapel, upon which he preached a holy word. He named this holy place of God, Duvieland. 

From there he set about conquering the known world, countless other human nations fell to his feet. It took two of his successors, Lar Servatius II and III, to fully conquer humanity and bring them into the One Truth. Now the near entirety of Humanity exists under the banner of the Holy Kingdom of Suzreal. The Church and the State are one and the same, with no separation of the two. 

The Church of the One True Faith worships Suzreal. Suzreal is God of Death, Blood, Life, Fire, and countless other things. He is the Father of Beasts and Man, his skinned flesh gave rise to the world they stand upon and his blood is from which they come. His clergy are marked by the cloaks they wear, made from the feathers of crows. He is a vengeful hateful God, to allow sin within others is to allow sin within yourself. You can not love thy neighbor, you must hate him. You can not accept your enemy, you must destroy him. You can accept no other Gods to exist, not even outside your community, you must deny them and slay their followers. You can accept no being other than the purity of Humanity, for any other creature that proclaims itself equal to man is a liar and should be thrown to the dirt. 

The Church has a special sect of individuals known as Church Hunters, or as others call them Church Crows. They are children raised from birth to be brutal killers, assassins, and soldiers. They collect, torture, and kill heretics and any others who would defy the Church. They are so feared that a King could have an army of a thousand men and not a single one would step forward to stop a lone Church Crow from butchering and killing the King. They march at night and day, collecting those believed to be heretics. When a Church Hunter knocks on your door, coming for your loved ones, you let them in and thank them for their service. To deny them is to in all but words proclaim your heresy. 

In terms of holidays and sacred times, the Church has a required Month of Penance. This is the time when people are only allowed to eat and drink certain things. They are only allowed meat, water, and blood. They'll drink both purified animal blood and ""saintly"" human blood, while also purging themselves of their sinful blood via bloodletting. Bloodletting is a  common practice, with very minor stuff occurring daily, but during the Month of Penance it becomes far more than just a little blood spilling. People will often drain themselves of so much blood during this time that the rates of death by exsanguination skyrocket to about 30%. People believe sin resides in the blood, so they'll often carry bloodletting charms with them everyday. It might be a ring that you can pull a blade out of, a spike on a necklace, etc. What you do with it is essentially you cut your hand whenever you feel sinful. Its also a common party event, with people bloodletting with their hosts. 

What counts as sin is actually quite easy. Heresy, sloth, treachery, and theft are all sins. Treachery has a lot of things that fall under it like adultery, breaking a promise, etc. You can remove sin by bloodletting or confessing at the end of the week, as that is the most appropriate time to confess, though you are encouraged to confess as soon as possible after a sin. Any sins confessed are recorded in a massive book that each individual Church possesses, about the size of a small table and thicker than a person. Confessed sins, except heresy, are not held against you and can't be used in any court of law or God.

"dq5fx4w","‚ÄúI‚Äôll be back. Wait here,‚Äù I said to my wife. Her bottom jaw clapped against her upper jaw while she nodded. She still had not learned to talk yet, after the accident. But, she was getting better. I kissed her smooth, pale forehead and left the house. We lived on the outskirts of town, preferring our space. We‚Äôd had [one neighbor](http://hserratafun.blogspot.com/2017/11/zero-hero-11-13-17.html) about a year ago, but he angered the wrong person. Now his house sat empty, I doubt anyone knew he was dead. 

I walked into town for my monthly supply run and noticed more commotion than usual. I passed a kid putting flyers up, and grabbed one from him to read. The king sought a hero to defeat a new threat. A powerful sorcerer calling himself the Demon King threatened the land, and the last guy to save the world had not presented himself yet. The king grew desperate advertising for any adventurers to take on the powerful evil. I didn‚Äôt think much of it until I glanced at the drawing of the Demon King at the bottom of the flyer. He looked like a standard powerful, mad sorcerer. The picture showed him in flowing robes and a pair of ram horns curling out of the sides of his head. Then, I saw the number ‚Äú2‚Äù tattooed on his hand. I knew my wife would want to take him on. I decided to visit the weapon shop instead of the general store. 

I turned a corner and noticed a line coming out of the tiny shop, about a dozen adventurers lined up to gear up. I joined the back of the line, behind a man in fighting monk robes. He turned when he heard me approach and gave me a nod of acknowledgement. I smiled. 

‚ÄúGoing after the Demon King?‚Äù I asked. Before he could answer, a heavily armored knight clanked by and stopped to glare at me. 

‚ÄúBeat it, skullfucker, no one‚Äôs as desperate as you. No one wants help from your dark arts. My party can handle the Demon King no problem.‚Äù His group laughed. Their magician pulled a chicken bone from his robes and winked at me. 

‚ÄúHere‚Äôs a little something for your wife. I know how much she likes cock,‚Äù the man in orange robes tossed it at me. It was a simple underhand toss and I did not intend to flinch, but I did anyway. The monk‚Äôs hand flew up in front of me and caught the bone. His sudden movement startled me, and the group laughed. Without a word the monk twirled the chicken bone in his fingers and flicked it at the knight. It went through his armor and into his arm. Their healer rushed to his side while he yelled and cursed.  The rest of his group got the idea pretty fast and they ushered him away. 

‚ÄúSo, you‚Äôre the necromancer?‚Äù The monk asked, with a pleasant smile. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve heard *things* about you.‚Äù

‚ÄúThanks for that,‚Äù I said. I gestured at the empty road where the group stood moments before. ‚ÄúThe rumors are technically true, but you know how life is. It‚Äôs not as cut and dry as all that,‚Äù I said sheepishly. He seemed like a fair guy and I didn‚Äôt want to misrepresent myself. The line moved forward. 

‚ÄúYes,‚Äù the monk nodded. ‚ÄúLife is rarely cut and dry. To answer your question, yes. My friend and I are going to try for the Demon King. I‚Äôm just here holding a place in line, she‚Äôll be back when I get into the shop. What about you?‚Äù He asked. I shrugged.

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt know about him until today. But there‚Äôs a good chance my wife will want to.‚Äù He cocked an eyebrow at me, and smirk tugged the corners of his mouth upwards. 

‚ÄúYour *wife*? The one from the rumors?‚Äù  I nodded again. The line moved forward. I took a step forward before he realized it, because he was facing me. He took a step backward without turning around.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs complicated.‚Äù 

‚ÄúComplicated is fun sometimes. I‚Äôve trained for over 20 years as a monk.The most important lesson I learned is, numbers matter. I‚Äôm actually a healer, my partner is the fighter. She‚Äôs fantastic. Vicious, but fantastic. A pair of sorcerers would help round out the group nicely. Think your wife would welcome a couple more?‚Äù He asked. The monk gave me a genuine smile, and I hoped my wife would say yes. She had her pride as a sorcerer, but desperate circumstances required desperate actions. I nodded at him. 

‚ÄúWe can certainly try to talk her into it. After this why don‚Äôt you and your partner come by my house to meet her?‚Äù I stuck out my hand. ‚ÄúMy name is Allister.‚Äù The monk grabbed my hand. I felt 20 plus years of callouses in his hand.

‚ÄúI gave up my name, I am just *Monk*.‚Äù He bowed. The line moved forward. We were almost in. The most beautiful woman I‚Äôd ever seen walked up behind Monk. I love my wife, and we have the deepest connection possible. But I still knew how to appreciate beauty. This woman had long, straight red hair that reached her waist, and fiery red eyes to match. She stood taller and broader than me. I measured 6‚Äô5‚Äù, and guessed myself to be a foot shorter than her. Standing behind Monk she appeared twice as broad as him. She clapped him hard on the back. 

‚ÄúHey Monk, who‚Äôs our new friend?‚Äù Without turning to her, he introduced us. 

‚ÄúAllister this is my partner, Flutter. Flutter, meet Allister. We might be teaming up for this adventure.‚Äù 

‚ÄúOkay. I‚Äôm going inside,‚Äù Flutter said. Our spot in line reached the door. Monk stepped out of line and nodded at me. I entered the store behind Flutter to browse around. 

After we finished shopping I led Monk and Flutter to my home. I sent my wife a telepathic message that I was bringing company, but it was okay. She wasn‚Äôt happy, but I explained about the Demon King and his tattoo. She changed her mind quickly. Flutter bought a couple of swords. On the way home I asked her about armor. She wore only a simple sundress. 

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt need it. I‚Äôve got Monk,‚Äù she said. I wondered how good his healing skills were, for her to have that attitude. My wife probably didn‚Äôt need their help, but it‚Äôs always handy to have. We reached my house, and I opened the door to show them in. 

‚ÄúMonk, Flutter, this is my wife. Ballisea.‚Äù I gestured at a skeleton sitting on a chair next to the bed. The skeleton stood up and walked over to greet them.

"dpzqt5x","Nice, I've been triggered. Looking forward for moar post like this in /r/Megaten...

Anyways, perhaps is asking too much in expecting Atlus do their homework, given they're balls deep crazy into  ""humanity free will"" and ""New world order"" tropes as the narrative epicenter of their games... 

As long as It serves to convey those tropes, they don't care to put Sarasvati or Apsaras (or any other random demon) on the streets roaming around tokyo attaking humans on sight, despite that makes as much sense as an  Amish riding a Mercedes Benz; considering their character and identity. It makes sense for demons like rakshasa or any other Jaki creature, because their mythos depict them as **evil and vicious**. 

But for benevolent devas? It looks like devs said: ""LOL they're just fusion fodder"" and distribute them across level ranges according some random criteria, and pretty much ignore the **backstory they just copypasted in demons's profiles**. 

And, how many times a law alignment character was able to control chaos alignment demons? Even for their own set of rules they don't give a damn. Quite ironic considering how much of a deal alingment is in a Megaten game. There's so little respect to anything they add that isn't planned for a sidequest or main storyline, just to fill a content quota.

Right now, by writing this Imma getting more fond of a computer game called **Darklands**. Pretty olde game with a crappy real time combat mechanics, but hell, Devs made anoutstanding work to depict medieval Germany as the same way as the medieval people would perceive it,  with all the magic realism contemporary supersticion would provide.

You see, Darklands offers a not too shabby catalogue of **medieval saints**, your character roster believe and may pray for saints. Saints profile includes their lives, feast days and miracles, all of which is directly implemented into gameplay.

Let's take a look to an example [Saint Michael](http://core-rpg.ru/_ph/711/794897663.png). 

Profile provides a little backstory:'Patron Saint of battle of Brussels, and Germany. One of the three captains of  heavenly hosts'...' But also how is this translated into gameplay:

- Increase weapon skill, charisma, improves armor.....
- Improves reputation around Germany and Brussels.

Similar to a Megaten demon's profile. But actually relevant and useful to read. Imagine how enthralling would be implementing something similar.

"dpasar9","I'll say this, Evans can absolutely lay the wood as well.  Ask Zeke after that lateral play at the end of the Cowboys game, or that poor receiver he destroyed on Hawkins' INT in the preseason last year.  He's 10 pounds heavier than Brice and ran almost the same 40 (4.44 vs 4.47), and he shows it at times.  I do think Brice is a special hitter, but definitely don't sleep on Evans here, he has a reputation for power:

&gt; Evans, a rookie free agent from Utah State, was a hard-hitting tackling machine last Thursday night against Oakland. In just 20 snaps, he tackled ball carriers four times for a net of two yards, dove head-long into a 330-pound tackle to strip blocking on another play and delivered not one but two wicked blocks on Josh Hawkins‚Äô long interception return.

&gt; However, Hawkins‚Äô pick made Evans the proudest. Just as K.J. Brent was reaching to tackle Hawkins, Evans decleated him with a vicious but legal hit.

&gt; He didn‚Äôt stop there. Sprinting in front of the Packers bench to stay ahead of Hawkins, he tried to run right through guard Vadal Alexander, a 326-pound rookie. Hawkins went for 13 more yards as Alexander gave more ground than Evans from their violent collision.

It wasn't must-cover ground at all. We know why Klingons look different - because they got a bigger budget for TMP. DS9 did a 'fan wink' with the 'we do not discuss it with outsiders' bit. 

ENT killed what was a funny joke by bothering to explain it (unnecessarily, IMO). Literally nobody was concerned about the makeup upgrade, we all know it was just that. Yet Enterprise had to go and pedantically make it a canon thing, an answer to a question nobody asked. Nobody was wringing their hands over the 'Klingon forehead problem' *until Enterprise worked it into the canon* and now it's some sort of issue. 

This is the thing that irritated me about Enterprise. It had an opportunity to separate itself from the canon by being an 'early days of Starfleet' story, yet it ended up being mostly a retread of things we've seen before. Augments! Ferengi! Borg! Mirror universe! Romulan-Vulcan stuff... etc. Enterprise was afraid 'to boldly go where Star Trek hasn't taken us before'.

As for Discovery.,. it's far too soon to tell where this all goes. Maybe it will somehow work its way into canon completely. I hope it doesn't, personally. I'm really liking these re-imagined Klingons.

"dnb0r88","Ugh. My mom has been in therapy for years, and takes all sorts of antidepressants and anti anxiety medications amongst other stuff, (one is an antipsychotic) so she must have been diagnosed with *something* fairly serious, but she forgets her lies and has given me different answers. Usually she will find the most benign answer, ""oh, I have been going for twenty years because arachnophobia"". (She takes a suite of medications used to treat cluster B's, and some other medications on top of that, so she either has been formally diagnosed with BPD, or her therapist has managed to prescribe all of them to her without giving her *that* diagnosis. I'm banking on the former. 

She has stabilised somewhat over the years with the medication, her freakouts are less... just...wild, she is less violent, but as her hormones have  changed over her life, so too has the efficacy of different combinations, so it's a constant rubics cube situation of trying different combinations and strengths. Part might be that I don't see her very often anymore so I just don't see the antics as much. She's also in her late sixties, so maybe her rage is just winding down with age a bit. To answer your question, medication has helped with the mood swings, but I can't see that therapy has been any help for her at all. Then again, I don't know what she would be like without it, she might be even worse. She says it makes her feel better, so good I guess, but its not changed her behaviour or reasoning as I can tell.

It's now a no go topic with her, as she feels trapped when we talk about it and gets hostile. I try to gently mention things, usually going down a ""I'm sure it runs in the family"" route, trying to talk about it but in a more abstract way, like, ""mom, you know grandma was a diagnosed and medicated schizophrenic, do you think maybe that did some harm to you when you were little? Maybe this is how some of your 'issues' started?"" (My maternal grandmother also practically radiated BPD, along with the other issues, and was a vicious but neglectful witch type. The horror stories about her actually make my mom look tame. My mom's own childhood treatment was nothing short of criminal.) I was trying to get my mother off the hook a little, hoping that if she didn't feel like she had to shoulder the whole blame for BPD that she could admit it and start to deal with it in relation to her family.

It's not worked so far, her explanation for grandma was that she was occasionally ""possessed by demons"". (Gran was hospitalised several times for delusional states, ES therapy, etc. She was, clinically diagnosed, several times over. ) 

I generally don't bring mental illness up anymore with her. You might have to digest that your mom will never accept that diagnosis. Also BPD is an ugly diagnosis to hear, any information out there is usually along the lines of ""Run. Run away fast."" And ""there's not much you can do with them, they don't change"" and so forth.

Imagine if you told her you thought she was a paranoid schizophrenic, or a psychopath. She would take offence probably (I'm not sure why you would be defensive about a mental illness you possibly inherited, but there it is.) so my guess is that she might not want to label herself with that particular name. My mom got hung up on the 'personality' part of BPD, in her mind I'm just saying that she has a shit personality. (She does.) mom much prefers 'chemical imbalance' or something that sounds more clinical and like you can just take a tablet for it. 

This might be part of your mom's inability to accept that she might be a cluster B? It must take a lot of work for a person to accept such a serious diagnosis. I actually feel really bad for people with BPD, it's a horrible disorder. It also does not permit you to act like an asshole all of the time, so I will feel empathy from afar in these situations. 

My mom also likes to tell me ""my therapist thinks you are all horrible people. And that you should call me more often."" üôÑ

I'm sorry you are going through this, lordy it sucks. Stay strong and hang in there, the more you learn about the disorder, hopefully the more equipped you will feel to deal with it.

That's a David Simon staple, I think, as it's also what made The Wire so compelling to me: it's a hard, honest look at a hard part of life, but the mission is never to just exact sympathy or horror from the viewers.

Instead, the show just displays this gritty, illicit subculture in all its nuances. The street life is exploitative and often vicious, but it is also a business, a culture, with its own rules and its own daily humdrum. The prostitutes are not just helpless victims, but people practicing a dangerous trade. The pimps aren't just violent villains, they are also clever businessmen. And the police are both in conflict with this subculture, and deeply entwined in it. It all forms an ecosystem that, despite its lawless state, and despite the violence that pervades it, manages to function, day in and day out.

The Wire accomplished exactly the same with the modern drug trade. It was completely honest about the violence, misogyny and viciousness of the drug trade, but also showed that dealers and gangsters are also just regular people, and that ultimately, they can be very likable, despite their criminality.

"dn7zzjo","&gt;Is it Feser, or more traditional NLT?

It is Feser. But it should be noted that Feser is a ""traditional"" or ""old"" natural law theorist, as distinguished from the new natural law theorists of, say, the 20th century.

&gt;How can it be considered natural though? We wouldn't exist if it were natural for (all) humans to be chaste.

As a preemptive note: we have to remember something here: we are talking about two very different schools of thought, with different background metaphysics. Like I've said, it would not be correct to call Kant a natural law theorist, but there are striking parallels between the two, and one can certainly see how either could be sympathetic to the other in some regards. But they also disagree vehemently in some regards, e.g. as concerns these ethical issues, but also, in their metaphysics. You're also implicitly asking me to, basically, give answers from two different schools of thought, who come to different conclusions on these issues, and compare and contrast them. I can do that, but just understand that that is exactly what we're doing. They are *not* the same. Parallels? Yes. Same. No. Okay, with that out of the way:

Both: Chastity is understood in two ways. We could call them temporary and permanent. Respectively: refraining from extramarital intercourse (where marital is traditionally understood) and taking a vow of chastity. 



Natural law theory:
---

Not concerned with whether something is universalizable in the way that Kant is. So, the question doesn't really apply to them in the way you've posed it. Accordingly, it is not an *unnatural* use of the faculties for human beings to refrain from using their faculties, and vows of celibacy and silence are not out of the question, because they go above and beyond natural calling. Both ""temporary"" and ""permanent"" chastity are perfectly fine, and ""temporary"" is expected. 

Notes: I assume that ascetic virtues would be considered ""supernatural"" or ""super-mundane"" in character, rather than unnatural. NLT makes background metaphysical assumptions like a top-down chain of being, and that evil is the absence of good- neither of which Kant affirms. Why is that relevant? Well, because if you take on these sorts of ""holy"" vows, from the NLT perspective, then you're going above and beyond what is necessary. So for the NLT, such vows and other holy, monk like behavior would be totally beyond the bar, and perhaps something like their version of ""supererogatory."" To do what is natural is what is good, and to do what is unnatural is to do what isn't good. But to do what is ""supernatural"" is to be holy and saint-like. Remember that my previous reply was *not* from a natural law theory perspective, but defending what Kant likely would have thought about natural/unnatural from his background metaphysical assumptions. 

Kant: 
---

Not a natural law theorist. Like Hume, he thought ""radical and monkish"" virtues are ridiculous. It's interesting because the background metaphysics we get from Kant in ""ATTEMPT TO INTRODUCE THE CONCEPT OF NEGATIVE MAGNITUDES INTO PHILOSOPHY (1763)"", one of his earlier works which we see informing his later critiques, kind of backs up why he wouldn't see things in the way that NLT does, ethically speaking. 

At any rate, [Kant would almost certainly say](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/kant-hume-morality/#VirVic) (make sure you scroll down a bit, because that is a Kant vs Hume page, not just Hume) that taking a vow of silence or taking a vow of permanent chastity would be unnatural/vicious. But, for example, he wouldn't say that taking a temporary moment of silence in honor of someone would be vicious and unnatural, though it is natural/virtuous for us to communicate honestly with our communicative faculties, and technically we aren't doing that while remaining temporarily in silence. He also wouldn't say that remaining chaste in the temporary sense would be vicious, because marriage would be a part of human nature for Kant, and sex should only occur within the bounds of the marriage. So basically, ""chaste"" in this sense means, acting on a maxim whereby one does not have sex outside the bounds of marriage. It also wouldn't be non-universalizable. 

What would be non-universalizable would be: a vow of chastity (""a monkish virtue"") due to it being a contradiction in conception, and unnatural use of the sexual faculties due to it being a contradiction in will. A lot of people, I think, get the CIW wrong because it's not as straight forward as the CIC; perhaps due to the neglect of the teleological nature of the doctrine of virtue. Perhaps we could say that CICs are, in some sense, analytically wrong, whereas CIWs are synthetically wrong. What I'm suggesting here is that there is something further (and external) to which we must appeal to understand why something is a CIW, whereas with a CIC, they are ""internally"" contradictory. I imagine that what a CIW appeals to externally is the good of humanity. So, then, what is unnatural and not ""willable"" is probably something along the lines of what is not for the good (the ends) of humanity (rational animality). 

&gt;And if the reasoning is that it can work because not everyone will be chaste at the same time, then that reasoning could just as well work for ""vices"" like homosexuality.

I think the issue here is this:

According to Kant, only having sex within the boundaries of marriage is considered what is natural for human beings (is part of the ends of their rational animal nature). In this way, children have two parents who raise them and educate them appropriately.

Insofar as we look at chastity as a monkish virtue, like, as a vow of chastity, then Kant is going to deny that that is good or natural. As the SEP article states, Hume seemed to have a big influence on Kant in this regard, and Kant largely agreed on that point with Hume. You're not good just because you're ""acting holier than thou"" and taking vows of chastity, silence, flagellating yourself for God, and so on. 

Both basically call BS on that. Kant does it in a reasonable manner: these violate our duty. 

At any rate, Kant sees marriage as part of the system of ends of human being (rational animality). Part of that system involves producing and raising children within the bounds of that marriage. To refrain from having sex outside the bounds of marriage would, then, not be wrong or unnatural. If you're still chaste outside of marriage, you haven't gotten a chance yet to do what is natural, but you're also not acting unnaturally. End-duties (such as these) are imperfect and admit of latitude. But that doesn't mean you can violate them. It simply means that it's not wrong to achieve all of them.

&gt;That's the big question though: how can it be normative, if nature itself has no intentions?

You realize that you're just begging the question, correct? Mathematical equations describing reality don't feature intentionality, but they also don't feature a lot of other things either.

As for the apology, again, I didn't articulate well. I was really just trying to contrast it to the non-apology he tried to give when called for ""Death to Jews.""

The amount feedback I got after raking him over the coals for why we should have zero tolerance for that gave me a good perspective for how blindly folks will follow him and it frustrates me.

"dmqwp6q","Sure, that's why I said the theory that it isn't really Arya could be true but there really isn't any evidence to suggest it as of right now. If she was No One, I still don't get killing Walder Frey and making sure he knows it's ""Arya"" unless it's actually her. If the Faceless Men are ego empty husks, there's no reason to have the ego to let Frey know who killed him, right? The only time it would make sense is, like I said, if she had announced who she was for the benefit of the women to overhear since she wasn't killing them.

It's the same issue that Marvel had with trying to make Captain America a Hydra agent and pretending that was always the case; that it would fundamentally change the character *forever.* The problem is that we've literally seen his internal monologue and private moments that completely refute the idea that he was Hydra all along, not to mention the numerous times they've attempted to brainwash him and successfully did so for a time which doesn't make sense if he was one of their own. With Arya, we've now seen multiple private moments that wouldn't really make sense for anyone but Arya to have: making sure Walder Frey, a person she kills immediately afterward, knows it was a Stark smiling down at him as he dies but then *not* announcing that fact to the large room of Freys including a few women and girls that she spares; communing with the wolves and calming them down; etc.

Also, while GRRM, loves heartbreaking stuff, he usually has substantial writing to back up reveals and twists and most major character deaths have happened on screen. While they're ""random"" in the sense that the heroes often would find some way out of the death in a lot of other stories, no matter how unlikely, they've all usually had some amount of reason to them. It wasn't just ""oh by the way, Ned died of dysentery on the way back to Winterfell from Kings Landing."" We even saw the death of Rickon, a character who, by all accounts, was a secondary and mostly unimportant character since he was so little early on and then got written out of the show. He and Osha came back so we could see their fates. To suddenly reveal that a major character actually died offscreen by some random Waif who really isn't all that important would be rather odd. 

Either way, one of the characters died offscreen: Arya or the Waif... But the Waif was no one, pun intended, so who cares if she died offscreen? And if Arya *did* get killed by the Waif, it would just feel weird. The Red Wedding is morbidly satisfying -- not in the sense that we like it but because it works within the story just as Ned's death does. We hate it but they work. There's a reason that most of the characters have had impactful deaths. 

See what I mean? It wouldn't even really be Arya dying that would be bad, it would be the fact that it just wouldn't fit right. All those other horrid and depressing deaths are sad but they work for the story. Killing Arya just because wouldn't work the same way. Now, maybe, that's what GRRM wants but I'd say that it wouldn't really be ""satisfying"" like those other deaths, if that makes sense. It's the difference between being upset because a character people really liked died (that's a very well documented and established part of the show/books at this point) and being upset by the execution and the writing of it, which is not a good way to upset the audience.

It could be true but we don't really have any evidence or interesting reasoning behind it. Despite all of the subverting of classic tropes and cliches and all of the death, GRRM still follows the idea that everything in a story should have a reason and set up of some sort. He doesn't have these characters die from stray arrows during a battle offscreen after all. Wouldn't that be more random and realistic than some of the crazy plot twists he's had?

No, they die after several episodes of being held captive and from someone well established to be a vindictive and petulant child with symbolic imagery foreshadowing it in the very beginning; or they die after breaking an oath and then being invited to a wedding by a man who clearly holds grudges and hates how others have looked down on him; or they die as a means of furthering another character's arc like someone who we know has always been ashamed of his own son and treated him poorly or someone who was mostly a minor character who was killed by someone who always loved to turn murder into a sport as a means of throwing off the older half brother; etc.

A character like Arya getting unceremoniously killed offscreen is not the right way to go about things. She can have an unceremonious death -- the Red Wedding is contextually unceremonious and vicious but it's dramatic because we see it. Could you imagine if instead, they went in and shut the doors and then we were simply told next season that they had died? Would that have been as heartbreaking, gut wrenching, or satisfying? The cut to silent music in that episode is eerie and well deserved because we feel empty after that. Like... holy shit, what in the actual fuck? Take that all away and replace it with a raven informing Sansa of their deaths and suddenly you're left feeling like ""um...okay?""

Now, Arya is different of course and the entire concept of the Faceless Men works in a way those other deaths don't by even giving the possibility of the switcheroo. But what seems more like GRRM's style? A sudden reveal that the character is already dead... or making sure we watch it happen and can cry over how fucked up it is? To me, the latter is more his style *unless* there's adequate evidence to back up the former but in that case, I'd expect amazing foreshadowing which just doesn't seem to work with what we've seen her do in private. Maybe the book would be different but if the show fucked up the foreshadowing, that's still a big problem.

"dmdx02y","There's some youtube plot overviews, some up to an hour and a half, that you can put on in the background if you have time. You can also find a tl;dw below:

&gt; Some amount of decades after our current time, weird shit goes on in the solar system. Nations unite and fly to mars, they find that it's being terraformed and find a giant white space ball. This is the Traveler.

&gt; Traveler is seemingly a good intelligent being and ushers in a golden age for a few hundred years, crazy science advancements are made and we make super AI and all crazy shit. 

&gt; Then a mysterious ""darkness"" approaches and wrecks us. Nobody knows exactly what it is, but it's apparently super evil. Humanity is decimated halo-style, reduced to scattered remains. Golden age knowledge is lost. The traveler is weakened, not able to communicate and sitting motionless. But apparently it halted the darkness' advance. Its last gift is little smart robots (ghosts) which are basically mini-monitors and ""the light"" which is space magic abilities.

&gt; Eventually survivors band together and found ""The Last City"" under the protective field of the Traveler, now floating motionless and silent.

&gt; There's 4 alien races, some tied to the darkness somehow, in the solar system fighting us and fighting eachother.

&gt; Hive: Space zombie-zerg minus the hive mind that practice a ""sword-logic"" type of evil fuedalism where they like absorb or eat everything they kill (and they kill everything) and tithe part of the sacrifice, or something. They worship the darkness and have space magic of their own. Definitely super evil.

&gt; Vex: Unknowable time-shifting hive-mind robots that move back and forth through time and do all sorts of weird shit. Maybe from another dimension, who knows. They're weird and spooky.

&gt; Fallen: A race the Traveler previously uplifted that fell to chaos and strife, maybe due to an external force, when the Traveler left. They want the Traveler back. They're scrappy and vicious but not necessarily evil, they are kinda like Jackals.

&gt; Cabal: Advanced military race, they want to conquer stuff. They're named after Roman shit. Not necessarily evil but are huge dicks and would probably like to take all our resources and enslave us, if they even think we're worth keeping alive. Might be running from something.

&gt;During the course of Destiny, apparently players kill some Hive gods and stop a grey goo incident and there's some super golden-age AI, whatever. In Destiny 2 the Cabal apparently had enough of our shit and mustered a huge force and stole the Traveler and destroyed the Last City.

This is also a beta. There's probably (we'll know in a few weeks) some intro cinematics or an intro mission in the full release that covers the nature of the traveler and the last city.

I mean, imagine playing Halo 3 without knowing anything about the first two. Who's this green armored guy, and these weird squid aliens?

"dluktdm","**Old Prompt 1**

*So, I was inspired. Not exactly the prompt, but since Terren is not Inquisitor, he's clearly a companion, right?*

***

The Winter Palace was incredible. The colorful and intricate ornaments, the delicate statues and fountains everywhere he looked, the marbled alleyways‚Ä¶ Terren drank it all in. What he had seen of Orlais‚Äô architecture before coming to Halamshiral could be summed up as ‚Äúa tiny cabin at the edge of the Tirashan‚Äù. This was something else.

On the flipside, for all their glamour and external glitter, the stables were stables, and comfortingly familiar.

As they arrived, Terren deftly took Ghesta‚Äôs reins from Danevhen and smiled as his friend slid off his saddle, but as much as he wanted to touch him, take his hand or briefly squeeze his arm, he kept his hands to himself. 

Right now, Danevhen was the Inquisitor, not the mongrel Terren called *friend*, and people were watching, so he simply murmured, ‚ÄúGood luck, falon.‚Äù 

Danevhen nodded in acknowledgement, and a small smile crinkled the corners of his eyes before he turned away.

Once left alone with Ghesta, Terren had to fight off an army of Orlesian stable hands who wanted to take care of the Inquisitor‚Äôs mount. That would not happen on his watch. The Inquisition horses were the reason he had been sent here, and while Danevhen was busy deciding the fate of an empire, Terren would see the animals taken care of if it was the last thing he ever did.

As it happened, it very nearly was.

***
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not bad with horses, for a savage.‚Äù Erissa said the next evening.

She was leaning against a stall door beside him as he was scratching Ghesta between the eyes, just as she liked. The stables were empty save for the two of them, and Terren glanced at her and smiled.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure if I should be flattered or offended, flat-ear.‚Äù he replied amicably.

Erissa simply laughed. From the moment they had met the day before, they had taken to each other like peas in a pod, and Terren was glad to have an ally here. The stablemaster was giving him a hard time, grumbling that he didn‚Äôt need a rabbit to tell him how to do his job, but still insisting on giving the Inquisition horses the entirely wrong rations. Strangely enough, he seemed to respect Erissa, despite the fact that she was as much a rabbit as he was, and she had interceded in Terren‚Äôs favor.

As long as the horses were treated correctly, he was fine with that. He wouldn‚Äôt stay long enough to suffer from the stablemaster‚Äôs denigrations, and the man didn‚Äôt seem like a bad sort, save for the occasional slur.

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go get drinks, yes? All the nobles are partying right now, I don‚Äôt see why we shouldn‚Äôt.‚Äù Erissa prompted at last.

‚ÄúThat sounds‚Äî‚Äù Terren cut off abruptly as Ghesta‚Äôs eyes snapped open and moved her left ear. She lifted her head, suddenly awake and alert. Terren knew her well enough by now to know that this particular behavior meant the *danger* kind of alert.

Without thinking, he pushed Erissa into the next empty stall and pinned her against the far wall, crouching and putting his finger on her lips. She grinned, and her eyes danced as she murmured.

‚ÄúOr we could forego the drink.‚Äù

Terren flushed, but didn‚Äôt respond to the quip. His body tensed and the hairs on the back of his neck rose in apprehension. He couldn‚Äôt define how or why, but he knew something was very wrong here, and it went beyond Ghesta simply being startled.

‚ÄúSomething‚Äôs wrong.‚Äù he hissed, and Erissa cocked her head, watching him curiously.

‚ÄúTwitchy, are w‚Äî‚Äù she stopped mid-sentence, and Terren saw a shadow pass on the wall. He released her and, motioning for her to wait, he quietly slinked to the stall‚Äôs opening, peeking outside through the bars next to the door.

And found himself face to face with a red and white mask.

Without a sound, he jumped back and drew his dagger, coming to stand in front of Erissa in one smooth motion as adrenaline flooded his body.

‚ÄúStay behind me,‚Äù he said in a surprisingly calm voice as the masked figure slid into the box and danced towards him, a dagger in each hand.

This intruder was a not a darkspawn, but Terren‚Äôs life was threatened all the same, and having someone in his back in such a situation was not comfortable. He began to tremble, but tightened his grip on his ironbark blade, keenly following every one of the intruder‚Äôs movements. He would not be powerless again.

The assassin attacked, and in a heartbeat Erissa was not behind him anymore but at his side, slashing at the extended arm as Terren swiftly moved aside, outside of the attacker‚Äôs way. The assassin grunted and jumped back, their gaze darting from Terren to Erissa and back, reevaluating the odds. Then, they slid back out of the stall. Still tense, blood still rushing in his veins, Terren glanced at Erissa.

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt need protection, do you?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, but if you want to help I‚Äôm not turning you away.‚Äù she whispered back with a huge smile. The woman was insane.

‚ÄúWhat should we do?‚Äù Terren asked as quietly as he could. ‚ÄúSweet Ghilan‚Äônain, I hope they don‚Äôt attack the horses.‚Äù

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs an assassin trying to kill us and you‚Äôre worried about the horses?‚Äù Erissa hissed. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre insane.‚Äù

Terren shrugged, and Erissa gestured towards the entrance, signaling she would take a look outside. Terren swallowed and nodded.
Something told him that there was more to Erissa than simply *elven stable hand*. She moved as silently as a cat and with the grace of hunter, though she was no Dalish, and as much as he hated the idea of sending her into danger, he had a feeling she would fare far better than him, should something happen.

She peeked outside, then slid out the door and disappeared from Terren‚Äôs view. Cursing softly, he followed to the door and carefully looked around. 

Erissa was making her way towards the stables‚Äô entrance when the assassin stepped out of another stall and stood in front of her, blocking her way. They taunted her with a beckoning gesture and she readied herself to attack, and then‚Ä¶ A second assassin silently dropped from the ceiling behind her.

Acting purely on instinct, Terren lunged and struck. He felt the blade slid between the ribs as easily as if the person had been made of soft halla cheese. Pulling his dagger back, he struck again and the assassin fell to the ground with a sick gurgle. He had hit them right in the heart the second time, through the lungs.

*I just killed someone*, he thought dully as his dagger clattered to the ground, and he just stood there. He didn‚Äôt know what happened next, only that suddenly Erissa was shaking him as he stared at the corpse at his feet. How much time had passed?

‚ÄúTerren!‚Äù 

She slapped him and he blinked, focusing on her.

‚ÄúI just‚Ä¶ I just killed someone,‚Äù he said numbly.

‚ÄúYes. Good job,‚Äù she replied, placing her hands on his cheeks and squarely meeting his gaze. ‚ÄúAnd we‚Äôre both alive, thanks to you.‚Äù

‚ÄúWho *are* you?‚Äù he asked, trying not to think about the corpse in front of him, or the memory of what it felt like to stab a person.

‚ÄúShe works for me,‚Äù a voice said from the door. Looking up, Terren saw another woman. He gently took Erissa‚Äôs wrists and pushed her away from him to get a better look at the newcomer. She was wearing a mask and a simple ball gown that looked more practical than ostentatious and carried herself with an air of quiet authority that reminded him of his sister when she decided she would be the one in charge.

‚ÄúAnd who are *you*?‚Äù Terren asked, frowning. 

‚ÄúI‚Äôm Ambassador Briala. And you just saved the life of my agent.‚Äù

An elven ambassador? At the Imperial Court? Agent? 

*Stay away from politics. You‚Äôre just the horse guy.*

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre welcome,‚Äù he said, then turned away to face Erissa again. 

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, but I can‚Äôt let you live.‚Äù Briala continued. ‚ÄúErissa, kill him. We will blame the intruders.‚Äù she ordered casually.
Erissa turned to him and Terren‚Äôs instincts kicked in again. He backed away, raising his hands in defense. Where was his dagger?

‚ÄúI‚Äôm‚Äî‚Äù he stammered. ‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ Danevhen. The Inquisitor‚Äî‚Äù

*...is not here,* a vicious, but perfectly pragmatic voice whispered in the back of his mind.

What could he possibly say to get out of this? He would defend himself if he had to, he knew it now. But he didn‚Äôt want to harm Erissa. He liked her! 

But Erissa sheathed her dagger and turned to the Ambassador again.

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs alright. And I think you have more important problems right now, yes? I don‚Äôt think killing people who are on your side is the brightest idea, you know.‚Äù

They stared at each other, then at him, and Terren backed up a bit more, swallowing hard.

‚ÄúVery well. Just keep an eye on him until the end of the peace talks.‚Äù Briala finally relented, turning away. 

When she was gone, Terren sighed and picked up his dagger, sheathing it as he began to tremble uncontrollably. 

He felt like he was about to throw up, and his teeth were chattering when he murmured.

"dl9z5jy","I will not attempt to comment on military aspect (how was a Gallic warhost organised) as I do not feel I have read enough specifically on Gallic tribes and their wars to be able to comment, and I am nothing remotely approaching a military historians. Instead I will focus on Caesar's depiction of the Gallic armies. 

Caesar's *Commentarii de Bello Gallico* is a part of what we refer to as the Posidonian tradition, classical writings about the Celts as a whole, and includes authors such as Athenaeus, Diodorus Siculus, Strabo, and, of course, Posidonius himself, although his writings are lost. It is clear that the other authors heavily exploited Posidonius' writings. With the exception of Caesar, it is unknown how much, if any, contact was sustained between the other authors and the Celts, and we need to recognise that there is a distinct possibility all their accounts were simply culled from Posidonius' writings and contain no personal experience; the sheer physical distance between the writers and the Celts, or any of the barbarians, limited interaction and fostered a situation in which factual information about the Celts was scarce. 

As we are left with no historical records from the Celts themselves, it is impossible to validate or refute anything the classical authors ascribed to their culture, however, many historians believe that their depictions of the Celts can be understood as following the archetype of the noble savage. (**Edit**: It has been pointed out to me that the concept of 'White Man's Burden' is potentially more fitting here. I will retain the original answer but amend WMB to the rest of the response.)

The archetype of the Noble Savage/the concept of the White Man's Burden is utilised to invalidate the culture of specific ethnic groups whose conquest is either greatly desired, or to romanticise conquered groups who are no longer regarded as a threat. It must be understood this definition was not created by conquering people's as a means to an end, but later prescribed to their activities and their writings where the oppressed ""savage"" groups are concerned. It attempts to define and categorise human behaviour when dealing with people who are perceived to be inferiors. This model provides an explanation of why a people need to be colonised and civilised as well a motivator as to why the effort should be made to do so. 

The Posidonian tradition's establishment of the continental Celtic peoples as barbaric, tempestuous and vicious but also passionate, intelligent and valiant follows the archetype of the Noble Savage/White Man's Burden: a people who are uncivilised but inherently valuable to the conquering society. The Gauls are poorly disciplined and lacking in military organisation, but they are exceptionally brave and skilled at fighting. They were a people to be admired, but who should not and could not be trusted to live without Roman rule. 

The violence of all Celtic peoples, not just the Gauls, are thoroughly discussed in the Posidonian tradition: they fight at feasts, they head-hunt and carry the heads of their slain enemies with them on their horses or display them in their homes, and they partake in human sacrifice. They are boastful, vain, greedy, jealous, warlike and barbaric.

But at the same time, they are brave and intelligent. Strabo and Diodorus Siculus both comment on the intelligence and proclivity for education of the Celts. Caesar, more than any of the other authors, was fascinated by the Druids and discusses them at length. Their importance and their skill, both legal and divine, is emphasised by all the writers. 

So do we trust them? How accurate do we believe these accounts to be? We cannot possibly ascribe a personal agenda to Strabo, Athenaeus and Diodorus Siculus, and although more difficult to determine Posidonius' personal biases and intentions, there are those who believe his depictions of he Celts were philosophical propaganda: his descriptions of Druids can be seen as nothing more than attempt by Posidonius to enforce Stoic doctrine and create evidence to demonstrate his own personal theories. 

As for Caesar, his motivations are easier to imagine, as he was looking for a justification for conquest. Caesar was not a historian; he was a warlord who created the political propaganda he needed. Caesar needed to establish a reason for conquering the Celts. He needed to demonstrate their barbaric practices, their ferocity in battle and their bravery, not only to create a reason to subdue them, but also to create a worthy opponent, whose defeat would bring him glory.  

Caesar discusses their political situation, stating there are political parties ""in almost every home,""  and as this sounds tenuous and unstable, the Celts' propensity for battle and this unsound situation would have been a solid justification to go to war: subdue them before their fragile politics lead them into battle, either against each other, or Rome. Outside of wanting to take them over and create glory for himself, Caesar needed to create a benefit for the empire. He needed to demonstrate what would be gained by amalgamating the Celts. This is why he discusses the druids so thoroughly, why he emphasizes the Celts' bravery: he needed to make them appear valuable.

How accurate is his image of the Gallic armies? I wish I had firm answers and I encourage you to do more reading and form your own opinions. As for myself, I think it is mostly propaganda, and I think all of the writings of the Posidonian tradition need to be read skeptically, and critically.

"dl2t9m3","My rules are as follows:

1. Any intelligent race has to be mammalian. I can't take lizard-people or fish-people or bird-people seriously. Granted, my main race, the havian race, has feathered wings, but the rest of their bodies are humanlike.

2. Any intelligent race has to stand upright. The reason humans evolved to be upright is because we started having to carry things (which is an inherent aspect of being an intelligent race), and some things are too big or heavy to keep in one's mouth, so we needed to be able to keep our hands free. The same logic applies to any other race.

I've created four races: the haviani (winged humanoids), the gargoliani (anthro dragons), the thanluriani (anthro-wolves), and the okuwariani (cross between anthro-dolphins and octopuses). My favorites are the gargoliani:

A gargolian is a large, powerful tank of a creature, with claws hands, leathery wings, and a beastly, muzzled face with horns on its head. You'll notice I referred to them as anthro-dragons, and a dragon is indeed what they resemble. However, in keeping with my first rule, they're not reptiles. Instead, they're mammals whose skin is coated in a layer of keratin plates, like a pangolin. The only part of their body not protected by these plates is the back of their head and their spine, allowing thick manes of fur to grow.

Aranise Thynerakir, (LE) Tiefling Rogue

When we were young, Karxius and I were inseparable, but that's not surprising for twins. Mother abandoned us, and Father didn't care. He was a blacksmith, a lockpick, and a regular at both the tavern and the jail. We were never bitter for it, though. He tried, he really did, but we didn't make it easy. By the age of 8, we had made a strange group of friends with the other outsiders in our dark little corner of Westvale. Urchins, orphans, miscreants and misanthropes. We made what fun we could, and when fun on our own wore out, we would involve the less-than-willing populace. It started as practical jokes for a laugh, but it turned into something else. We worked well together. We had nothing to lose. We could make people afraid. At 12, simple pranks turned into petty vandalism, and shopkeeps began involving the constable. He was no match for us, though. We were quick and quiet, and he couldn't keep up. At 15, you could complain to anybody about ""those night kids"", and they'd know you meant us. 

At 16, we wanted more from the world. We started by selling protection. Pay a couple silver, and maybe your windows don't break tonight. We faced staunch resistance, but the message soon became clear. There was no other way. Pay us, or we come for you. We began developing specialties. I was the schemer and the negotiator, good at setting up the plan, sneaking in, and convincing people to pay. We had a banker to keep our money in check, a gambler to take bets and make sure we always came out ahead, even a shmoozer to make powerful friends for us. At this point, most of our money came from backroom deals to hurt competition. My brother Karxius was the punisher. It was during this chapter that I first noticed a difference in him. You could see in the back of his eyes that he was happier when people didn't pay. He reveled in the destruction and the violence. As long as it didn't hurt the money, I saw no harm in it. By 17, we had evolved from a group of friends to a legitimate guild, and we owned this corner of the city.

Any guild needs leaders, and it seemed that there were a couple of contenders. Karxius had a natural charisma, and a temper that made disagreement with him a dangerous proposition. Isandre, a sharp-tongued half-elf, had all of the connections.  Pyuto the half-orc was the strongest, unmatched in combat. I was coolheaded, and good at seeing every possibility of a plan. Different members of the guild made their allegiances known, but we continued to work as a whole. We never developed an official name, preferring to be as difficult to identify as possible, but we came to be known as Sunset, as in ""You'd best pay up, or be wary of sunset"". We had the kind of standing where violence and destruction was no longer necessary. Any newcomer to the city knew not to cross us, and no amount of vigilante force or constable intervention could stop us. We only had to worry about ourselves. Karxius became impatient in the calm, and began attacking outside our sphere of influence. At first, this brought new protection money, but he was out of control. He wasn't after money, he was after destruction. Before he could embark on another nighttime raid of the innocent, Pyuto stopped him, and demanded that he stand down. People were leaving, fearing the darkness, and taking their money with them, and these excursions were costing the guild resources. We couldn't have that. Karxius killed Pyuto in his sleep that night, and the guild fractured.

Isandre and I continued our monetary operations as we had in the past, but we were more careful and stealthy, wary of crossing Karxius. The public still saw us as the same menace, but we knew that there was a difference between us and him. We were built on loyalty to each other and to the job, and a desire to gain wealth. His following was built on impulse and destruction, and he was followed out of fear. A tense peace was formed, until he went after a tavern under our protection. We would lose money, and more importantly, face, if we couldn't stop him. At 22, in front of the burning tavern, surrounded by our guildmates and friends, my brother stabbed me under my eye, and dragged the dagger down across my face, leaving a scar I bear to this day. Our corner of the city erupted into chaos, and became a warzone.

I escaped the initial conflict, but he seemed blind with bloodlust. He wanted me and everyone loyal to me on his side, or dead. Fighting a losing war, we were making plans to leave the city without dying, but our home was raided by Karxius and his thugs. Isandre was being skinned alive by someone we had known since we were 8. There was nothing I could do. I fled, with Karxius and his gang hot on my tail. He may be strong and vicious, but I am quick and stealthy, and I lost him in the chase. I made it out of the city alive, only to see the fire spreading from our neighborhood out all the way to the farmlands. He was burning the whole city down. I don't know if even he knows his purpose anymore. By the morning, Westvale was gone, and so was Karxius. I now spend every day preparing for when I find him again. I could say that I do it for the good of the world, to protect innocents from his scourge, but I have no reason to lie to you. Karxius will suffer unimaginably. I will have my vengeance.

"djkfk50","&gt;sad to see you downvoted, we're supposed to be better than that here in this lib sub

c'est la vie, I suppose 

&gt;a doctors rights should be limited to things like reporting abuse, and thats about it.

Reporting abuse to the government? 

&gt;if a kid is being injured to get pain killers, or comes in bruised, or if a 5 year old has bruises in their private places (idk where rape usually causes these things) then yeah, a doctor has an obligation. but a decision to cut life support, thats a moral decision, and they have no right to impart their morals on me or my family. thats where i draw the line.
so yeah, if the kid was being beaten everyday, a nd the doctors were like ""hey thats not how you fix a broken foot"" and took it to court, i would agree. 

I'd say that so-called ""moral issues"" are a lot broader than even this. If a kid comes in bruised, it could just be his parents beat him every day because he is a troublemaker. Should the government get a say in whether parents can engage in this extreme form of discipline? 

&gt;but to say i cant fly across some water and get treatment, because YOU feel like its wrong to keep somebody on life support, is completely unjustifiable.

Okay, here's another hypothetical (although this does happen). Child get sick with some vicious but easily treatable disease. According to the parents' religious beliefs, it is immoral to use man-made medicine despite the fact that without it, the child is likely to die. Instead, the parents pray for their child's health. Should doctors or the government be able to make this moral decision for the parents and say that they may no longer be the legal guardians of this child? Or should the child be allowed to die because the parents' morality is against medicine? 

&gt;and the reason gov is to blame, in a roundabout way, is because if they didnt pay, they wouldnt have a say.

I'm not sure if [the UK laws](http://www.nhs.uk/nhsengland/aboutnhsservices/documents/consent_%20aguideforparentsdh_4117353.pdf) that cover patient consent take into account whether the provider or insurer are government entities. I could be wrong here, but it seems to me that since private insurance *does* exist in the UK, it's potentially possible for the courts to hear a case regarding a disagreement between parents and private healthcare providers even if the procedure is paid for by a private insurance company.

* If the Bible were not true, knowledge would be impossible.
* Knowledge is possible.
* Therefore, the Bible is true.

For knowledge to be possible, laws of logic, truth, morality, and science (in particular, uniformity of nature) that are absolute, invariant, immaterial, and universal, would, by necessity, have to exist. The Bible provides justification for the existence of these laws. In rejecting the truth of the Bible, the unbeliever has no logical reason to believe that his senses and memory are basically reliable, that logical contradictions are false, that there is objective truth and an absolute moral code, and that the future will be like the past, and thus, has no real reason to believe that knowledge is possible.

Regarding your assertion that this argument is a logical fallacy, I would point out that every worldview has an ""ultimate authority"" by which all other truth claims are judged and thus uses some form of circular reasoning.

Just to nitpick this point here. I never said that they weren't brutal and/or vicious. But they certainly didn't organize warfare on the scale of even the ancient Romans and did not systematically seek to wipe out an entire ethnicity as, for example, the Romans did with the Carthaginians and the Gauls.

The myth that they spent most of their time killing and brutalizing was actually disproven by anthropoligists living with current HGs. Yes, they do engage in the occasional combat with rival tribes over territory, but most of their time is spent having sex, building stuff, playing games, and engaging in other leisure activities (don't have sources to cite at the moment as on my phone). Then they only spend a few hours per day finding food and water.

"dinx5kv","There's not a ton of lucid moments other than the odd quote here or there. Even when the Nails aren't biting he feels a lot of anger and resentment towards the Emperor, growing more and more upset as he finds out literally every other Primarch got to take their friends/adopted fathers with them on the Great Crusade. He often makes people turn their heads with a brief moment of spectacular insight or a philosophical comment about life before the Nails sting and he begins beating his head against the wall. Between the War Hounds being a vicious but honorable Legion and the few moments of profound discussion when Angron isn't raging, the tragedy of the World Eaters is a sad sight to see.

He does have a coherent moment in Lord of the Red Sands, when he's stalking the battlefield of Istvaan III and talks to one of his loyal sons who lays cut in half in the ruins. The Marine comments about how he's the one that landed a blow across Angron's neck and Angron gives a hollow smile and congratulates him on a job well done, then talks about how he's not siding with Horus but standing against the Emperor. The World Eaters are finally free, no longer slaved to a distant ruler. The Marine concedes the point before succumbing to his injuries and Angron stands up to continue the carnage.

As for the Daemonhood stuff, no. The Nails aren't just a physical thing anymore, but a permanent infection of his mind.

"dikkrmt","T_D shills are easy to spot, and often times I feel for them for wanting for their man, to be the man so bad.  Often times their shilling just seems to be desperate attempts to keep the hope going that this one man could possibly change this deep state takeover of our freedoms.   But isn't it too much to ask of any man or woman at this point to change our course?  We have mainstream media talking heads openly discussing our ""Deep state"".  That should send a chill through ever single patriotic American still paying attention and thinking for themselves.  We talk so often of past figures who have attempted to challenge this deep state, and what has become of them.  The dire warnings of the military corporate industrial complex, and how little they care for the American individual.  Our current president presented himself as a possible solution to the subversion of our democracy and freedom.  He has yet to show if he is actually capable of real change in this regard, but are you really surprised conspiracy regulars backed a man claiming to be ""giving them their country back""?  Maybe Trump will turn out to be just like all the others, maybe he already is, but everyday the forced narratives fail to ring true to me, I can't help holding onto the hope that he really means to do what he says, and that he is up against the exact foes that we spend so much time talking about.  If anything, one has to admit that there has never been such a coordinated attack from so many angles against a sitting president in our lifetimes.  While the cynic in me assumes that he is just another puppet, I can't help listening to that little voice that says, sometime, there must be someone strong and brave enough to stand against this corruption and horror being committed in all our names.  Someone willing to sacrifice it all, to bring America back to what we all thought we were, what we used to strive to be.  I am horrified at the amount of hatred being expressed daily, and the acceptance of status quo as being what is best for us.  What if we really can take our country back?  What if the United States truly can become a role model for decency for the entire world to emulate?  In a landscape of fallen role models, so many are desperately seeking a figure to be the light that so many know is needed.  It doesn't appear that Trump can fill this role he promised, although everyone has to admit the deck is stacked against him.  The propaganda is relentless and vicious.  But the facts remain, that we have lost the moral compass our nation used to be guided by, and so many are screaming silently for us to reclaim it.  We don't want these wars.  We don't want to propagate these horrible atrocities against other human beings in far off deserts being committed in all of our names, for the evidence is now clear that our foreign policies are bringing this evil upon us as a reaction to the massive holes in human empathy and consciousness we are helping to create all over the world. We truly could take back our country and rededicate ourselves to virtuous endeavors that we all subconsciously strive for.  Deep inside of all of us we just want to get along, and accept eachother's differences, and LOVE.  But we are bombarded with this constant war rattle, this constant need for conflict, both micro in our personal interactions, and macro in our collective acceptance of these endless wars.  At what point is enough enough?  At what point do the fake posters on this subreddit arguing for a failing paradigm, finally admit that they are hurting the very mother that has raised and nurtured them?  How far does it have to go for us to shout STOP! at the top of our lungs, and take our country back from these despicable forces which think of each and every one of us as a cattle to be traded at the block.  If any of you reading this have been coopted into fighting against the very things your soul is screaming for, I plead with you to find your courage to stand up against this dark force which has none of our interests in mind.  Say enough is enough.  Let us take our country back, and reshape it into something we can all be proud of, even in our disagreements.  We are all in this together.  Without love and empathy, especially for those you disagree with most, there will never be movement towards what we all know deep in our essence, what we truly could be.  How great we could be together working towards the things that matter, instead of sheepishly going along with these ridiculous anti human motives which we have all been conned into believing are real and important.  We can disagree and still discuss, and respect each other.  We in spaces like this can help create a new paradigm that we can be proud to teach our children.  The world does not need to be this dark, for there is so much good to focus on.  I will stop ranting now, but these things matter so much to me, and I know in my heart that they matter to you too.  That is why we are here, looking for answers to the questions our souls are screaming for us to answer.  Respect one another.  Stop trying to mislead, and manipulate.  Find the middle ground.  Not everything has to be utter blackness, or blinding light.  We are human.  Let us not forget our folly, and never stop striving for a balance that we all know is possible.

"dijqn6d","**Interviewer:** Welcome back to Coruscant's Strill News Network, your trusted source for galactic news.  Today we have a debate between Darth Vicious, the controversal Sith Lord who seems to be turning the galaxy upside-down, and Jedi Master Aysh, an esteemed Jedi known to for his charitable works.  Welcome to the show gentlemen.

**Aysh:** It's good to be on y'all.

**Vicious:**  I always enjoy these talks.

**Interviewer:** Alright let's get started.  Ever since the incident where several dozen Jedi and security officers were killed raiding the new Sith Academy's files, tensions have grown between the Sith and the Jedi.  With yesterday's report from the Coruscant Police Force that Vicious acted in both self-defense and defense of his students, outrage from the Jedi has escalated further.  Our experts believe that the Jedi might soon launch a full scale assault on the Sith Academy.  Gentlemen, what are your thoughts on all this?

**Vicious:**  Let me first apologize again for their deaths.  My intention was to have them leave peacefully without harming the students.  I did not mean to kill any of them.

**Aysh:**  The fact remains that yah did kill them Vicious.  Yah say that it wasn't  your intention, but unpredictable situations happen all the time.  It seems every month or so some glitbiter breaks into our temple with a blaster.  If y'all really serious about the safety of everyone in your college, what are yah going to do when something like that happens?  If yah can't control your strength well, then yah putting all your students at risk.

**Vicious:** Rest assured, I've taken steps to ensure that doesn't happen again. I have upgrading the medical center of my academy to treat even the most severe injuries, and upgraded the security system.  I am also personally spending an extra hour a day training for better control.  In addition, we will soon be starting drills designed to prepare students for emergency situations.  

**Interviewer:** Glad to see you're taking safety matters seriously Vicious.  But please, we have a lot to talk about and far too little time, so please keep your answers focused on the question.

**Aysh:**  Of course.  Now, I'm on the council, and I can tell y'all, there are no plans for any assault on Vicious' academy at this moment.  While we don't really agree with the conclusion that the CPF drew, none the less we respect their authority.  There are a few Jedi calling for an attack, but the council will not approve it at this time.  

**Interviewer:** You say ""at this time.""  Does that mean that you would be prepared to attack in the future if it came to it?

**Aysh:**  Let's be real here y'all, the Jedi and the Sith have been at war ever since there were first Jedi and Sith.  Historically, any truce between us has been short lived.  In addition, war, slavery, and fascism usually arise with the Sith.  The council does not intend to be caught unprepared this time.  So yes, we will be prepared to fight Vicious if it comes to that.  The Jedi will defend the galaxy. 

**Vicious:**  I completely understand your reservations.  Past Sith have acted less than ideal.  But I can assure you, that is all in the past.  I have no intention of repeating the mistakes of the past.  And if we're being real here, I worry more that you Jedi will start the violence this time.  You have already launched a raid on my academy and some of my teachers report receiving anonymous threats.  

**Aysh:** Y'all can't really believe we were behind those threats, can yah?

**Vicious:**  Well I don't know, they were anonymous.  

**Aysh:**  The Jedi don't do anonymous.  We try to make sure everyone recognizes us.  It has diffused a bunch of tense situations without any conflict before.  Why would we change it up now?

**Vicious:**  Well look at me.  The Sith used to hide in the shadows but I've stepped into the light.  Perhaps some Jedi decided to change things up as well.

**Aysh:**  But we haven't shunned the light and started meeting up in dark caves.  So how does that apply to us?

**Vicious:** Well I suppose it doesn't directly.  I was trying to make an analogy.  

**Interviewer:** Umm, don't mean to interrupt, but can we return to the topic?  Aysh, you mentioned that Jedi and the Sith have been enemies longer than anyone can remember.  What exactly is it that makes the Jedi and the Sith enemies?

**Aysh:**  It's a fundamental difference in how we view and use the Force.  The Jedi believe ourselves to be servants of the Force, and use it to help and protect others.  The Sith view themselves to be masters of the Force.  They draw power from anger and hatred.  Then they use that power to enslave and conquer.  

**Vicious:**  A force without something to act on is useless.  The Force needs us, while we do not need the Force.  When I sense the Force, I do not hear a voice that says ""lift that rock,"" or ""go to the corner of such and such.""  I get to decide how to use it.  And as far as anger and hatred go, yes, they are sources of strength for the darkside, but I find passion to be far better.

**Inteviewer:** Interesting, and Vicious, what would you say is the cause of the Jedi and Sith rivalry?

**Vicious:**  Like Aysh said, it's all down to a difference in how to view the Force.  The Jedi tend to limit themselves to their own bubble while the Sith explore the entirety of the Force.

**Aysh:**  The problem with that Vicious, is that those who explore those paths yah talking about tend to cause harm and destruction to those around and below them.  Governments and other authority figures throughout all history place limits what their subjects can do.  While y'all could explore every aspect of life, we know from history that things like murder and theft are not beneficial for a healthy society.  

**Interviewer:**  That sounds like a fascinating philosophical debate.  Unfortunately, that is not the subject of today's debate.  The last thing I wanted to bring up is Vicious' lawsuit against the Jedi order for crimes of kidnapping.  Aysh, any comment on that?

**Aysh:** Let me just say that Vicious is completely misrepresenting the Jedi order.  We do not kidnap children.  Let me just say that again.  We *do not* kidnap children.  Instead, when force sensitive children are born, we encourage their parents to let them become Jedi.  The decision is completely up to the parents.  In fact, many lower income parents are thrilled to have the opportunity for their kids to become Jedi.  When the children come of age, they are free to leave the order if they choose.  Vicious is making it sound like we force them to remain Jedi.

**Interviewer:**  Well that's just about all the time we have left.  Any quick last comments for each other?

**Vicious:** This has been an excellent discussion, I hope to get another opportunity to come on this show.  I also hope that the Jedi will come to look beyond the mistakes of the past and accept me and my academy.  

**Aysh:**  Thanks for having me.  We'll give yah a little room right now, Vicious, but if y'all up to something, then we will take whatever actions we need to in order to ensure the safety of the galaxy.",1496780926,"**inteviewer:** interesting, and vicious, what would you say is the cause of the jedi and sith rivalry?","interesting, and vicious","vicious",NA,TRUE,"interesting , and vicious","interesting",NA,NA,0

"dib5at7","Nice summary!

My current understanding, based on what Jasper said:
&gt; I was there you know. During the ***first*** war for this garbage planet.

Is that there actually were technically two wars with a brief pause in between.  

* The Rebellion spawned a war culminating and ending in the Shattering of Pink Diamond. After that, her forces were in disarray, and homeworld was in full retreat mode. This war was a loss for homeworld.
* During a pause that may have spanned a few decades, maybe a century, they hatched a plan making use of all the Gem shards they collected, mostly from shattered Crystal Gems, during the war. The plan would wipe out the Rebellion for good and it would wipe out Earth, the planet that disgraced and defied the Diamond Authority, along with them:  
It was basically a second, much shorter war, entirely focused on distraction. During this war, Jasper wasn't present for some reason. - maybe they deliberately kept Earth Gems away from it?  
Anyway, this was when the Cluster was created. Homeworld worked in secret under the Planet's surface, while distracting the rebellious Sapphire's future vision with plenty of vicious but aimless attacks.  
Then, as soon as the Cluster was finished, the final act: Everybody was to quickly evacuate. Unfortunately it wasn't as orderly as you'd hope for, so some Homeworld Gems actually got stranded on Earth, along with the surviving Crystal Gems. And it all ended with

"di9iixl","The thunder warriors were the first attempt made by the Emperor to create post-human soldiers. They were strong and vicious, but also psychologically unstable. Officially they perished during the Unification Wars, the last ones being killed in the last battle...in reality they didn't die in droves during the Wars and by the order of the Emperor were killed by the astartes *and* the custodes. 

During the Great Crusade some astartes feared the end of the conflict: considering that the Emperor was placing unagumented human civilians in places of power they feared that once the reconquest of the Glaxy was completed the Emperor would have killed them to make place for the next ""military tool"". In reality the Emperor wasn't working on astartes MKII...at least officially. 

When the Raven Guard Legion was decimated during the Horus Heresy the Emperor gave to Corax (the Raven Guard's primarch) the technology and the insights needed to create better marines at a faster rate: Corax called them his ""raptors"" (no relations with the 40K astartes chapter with the same name). They were bigger than standard astartes, faster and stronger. Sadly the Alpha Legion at that point already infiltrated the Raven Guard Legion, and proceeded to contaminate the geneseed of those ""raptors"": they mutated and Corax, not knowing it was an Alpha Legion covert strike, thought he made some horrible mistake and abandoned his Legion. 

In 40K Guilliman's ""primaris"" bear a striking resemblance to 30K Corax's ""raptors"". But considering that normal astartes can be transformed into ""primaris"" astartes I don't think they will receive the Thunder Warriors treatment...probably no one will create ""normal"" astartes anymore, only ""primaris"" ones, while the remaining surviving ""normal"" astartes will be slowly turned into ""primaris"" ones.

"dhnyvcw","Because of how Manson infamously backtracked the story, it's hard to see it as a complete narrative. Even picturing Mechanical Animals as a sequel to Antichrist Superstar is hard to buy for me because of how that story wraps up. I've tried all sorts of mental gymnastics to fit the story together. I've tried to tie the albums together in the backwards way he talked about; I've thought about mixing the songs in a different order to create one long album (which is what I did to get the full story of Ziggy Stardust); my wildest theory had them all happening concurrently about three different characters that are intertwined.

What makes the most sense to me is that it's a thematic trilogy. They work together in the same way Edgar Wright's Three Flavours Cornetto Trilogy works together. Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz, and The World's End are all about the main characters becoming worse from where they started, and are also tied together through running gags and returning actors. They aren't connected through universe or story. Separate stories, similar themes.

A story about a political revolution, a story about a pop star alien (or is it a pop star and an alien), and a story with Mark Twain levels of satire; it's kind of hard to see how they all fit into one another, especially as the same character. Even the tone is off between albums. Think of these as movies. Antichrist Superstar is part political thriller and part psychological horror with its grim aesthetics. Mechanical Animals is a trippy, psychedelic sci-fi mixed with a rock star biopic. Holy Wood is dark and vicious, but also biting in its sardonic humor. You have John Carpenter, David Lynch, and Stanley Kubrick. All great filmmakers, but all completely different in style and approach.

They have to be completely different stories. Better yet, they give three very different ways of looking at the similar ideas and themes.

Brutes, Elites, Humans, Jackals, and Grunts. The individual Hunter worms (malgecko something or other) seem to be easy enough to step on, and I won't bother counting them. 

Much the same reasoning as you for everything. Brutes are incredibly powerful with muscles like iron, and are strong enough to contend with and defeat armored Spartan II's without incredible effort. Elites have a warrior culture that trains them from a young age, and they're taller, stronger, and have greater mass than humans. Humans next (unaugmented) due to their discipline in combat. I think Jackals would be too quick to give in to a vicious but mindless attack, so a well trained human could counter and break a fragile Jackal. Grunts tend to be too stupid and cowardly to contend with humans, but I think a lucky or well placed strike could break a Jackal. A particularly determined Grunt could kill a Jackal, I think, but it could be a 50/50 fight.

Augmented humans, however, could be a much better fight for Elites. S-II's in particular could probably contend well. They have a similar time spent training and they're equally driven. S-III's have the same augmentations, and the Gammas in particular would be dangerous. The IV's, however, are far less augmented, and require their armor to be at peak effectiveness. I think an Elite could take them. Brutes would still break all of them with ease, though.

When I knew I would be DF'd, I went in to talk to our GM (a DO that gave many talks at the conventions). I told him what was going to happen and when he found out why (having a ton of gay hookups) he would probably want to fire me. I reminded him that I had a family and if I were let go it just wouldn't be me to suffer. He assured me that he would never do that and that, in fact, it was against the law. I was told that because of the circumstances that I needed to communicate with anyone in the other departments through email and messenger which seemed a bit counter productive to me. Little did I know. No one at work would look at me or talk to me. Except one sister who had been DF'd before. The next day I said a good morning to his wife who worked in the office with me and she didn't say a thing. I took two days off (which I had coming) to take care of some business and when I came back I was immediately called into the GM's office with the owner. He looked at me briefly with a look of disgust and never made eye contact with me again as he explained that I was no longer needed. Of course, I challenged him and his reply was ""What's it going to take to get you to leave?"" I made my demands for severance and a payout to which he replied ""Good"". I also told him that the shunning which I was experiencing with a vengeance was creating a hostile work environment and he said that it was me that was doing that. My keys and gas card were confiscated and I was told to wait outside until the papers were done and he would text me. He also said that they would clean out my desk and return any personal items, they didn't want me to touch anything. I remember it was really hot out but they were quick. He gave me one check for the pay period and asked me to come back for the first severance check the next day. I was to text him when I got there and he would bring it out.

And when the Empire finds that planet their response is ""why didn't we think of this first"" and then they start working to do it on an even bigger scale....

From what we've seen of him, he was just a particularly efficient hired gun until the whole plot to fake his death happened, so I would rank him relatively lower on the evilness scale. Meanwhile, both Renard and Hemlock caused mass deaths with their scheming (Renard by driving Cpt. Harvey over the edge, Hemlock by both being a serial murderer *and* a criminal kingpin with serious control freak tendencies) and threatened to do worse (Renard's bomb was a dud, but it's uncertain if he knew that when he made his threat, while Hemlock not only threatened the members of the court with armed gunmen, but also said gunmen and God-knows-how-many-more with Grapevine, and we KNOW he both believed it would work and that he went through with it).

Really, it comes down to your definition of evil. Hemlock could and would have done worse than Renard ever did, but while Renard gleefully admits he's a loathsome bastard and gloats about evading the justice he so richly deserves, Hemlock fully believes what he's doing is right. Both act in the ultimate form of self-interest, believing the only point of life is to do whatever makes you happy at the cost of everyone else, but Renard at least realizes he can't morally justify his actions- instead opting to simply consider morality beneath him- while Hemlock is too stuck in his ""happiness justifies the means"" mindset to see things from any other perspective but his own and thus believes everything is morally justified if it makes him feel better.

Cooperative with betrayal: 
--Saboteur. My kids loved this one at those ages, and the teams that develop can help mitigate hard feelings.
--Spyfall. A bluffing game, one player trying to ""blend in."" Lots of fun here.
--Resistance:Avalon. More talking, less of a board game feel, my kids really enjoy bluffing--if they like Skull, they will probably like this.

We've also had great success slightly modifying game rules--for instance, Codenames is a GREAT game, two teams pitted against each other, each has a ""spymaster"" giving clues to their team. In our house, we have two spymasters like the game says, but everyone else guesses for both spymasters. This keeps the kids engaged, and makes it so only the spymasters are actually competing--everyone else wins either way. People who struggle with losing don't have to deal with that, and the game stays lively and active with just five or six people playing.

Another one we regularly bend the rules for is Survive: Escape from Atlantis. (You'll need the expansion that ups player count to 5-6.) It's designed to be cutthroat and vicious, but when we play, some people choose to help each other and be benevolent gods instead of going in attack mode.

"dh3b5gw","Hello, /u/Forever_Vortex. Im so sorry you are going through all of this. There are resources out there for you. I do not know where you are in the world, so I recommend [thehotline.org](http://www.thehotline.org/) and [RAINN.org]( https://www.rainn.org/) in the US, and [HOT PEACHES](http://www.hotpeachpages.net/a/countries.html) in other countries for help and direction for abuse for you. I also know that while you are an adult, any abuse that happens to you is going to be domestic violence (its not just for significant others).  For your Brother, if he is younger, and under 18 its child abuse.  Most developed countries have serious laws against that and agencies to help with that, often called Child Protective Services. You should be able to identify which one applies in your area with some google-fu. 

Now, about your Dad being a good guy, yet he beats you and your Brother. I know this may be very confusing that he does both those things. Its actually called Cognitive Dissonance, when you try to understand and process that this person who can be very violent and vicious but professes to love you and is your parent, its just not easy for your brain to process. Your Father is abusing your Brother, and it sounds like he abused you too. Its physical abuse. Its child abuse. Its okay to call it that, its what it is. Its also hard to accept you were a victim of this, and how to manage that mentally. Its a very complex situation, when you love your abuser. 

As to your Mom, this is hard too for her, but she is legally responsible to protect her son from abuse. I know its scary, and I know that you fear retribution from him if you call the police and report it. But if your Mom does do that, she may lose her child as CFS will likely remove him from the home if she doesnt do something about it. You can also report this stuff to CPS. Since you didnt witness it, you can still report it to them. I know you say your Mom isnt strong enough. There are DV advocates and people out there to help her with this. She needs to do something or she can lose her kid. She doesnt get to excuse inaction to protect him, its her job in life here. And I know first hand how scary it is. But she absolutely can do something about it. She doesnt want to do something about it. I get it, I understand the fear, but your kids come first. Youre only 19 here. As you get older, you are likely going to be very angry with her for not doing something to protect you or your Brother. 

There is no magic here. Someone has to do something. Hes an abuser. He likely needs to beat on someone to manage his anger and rage and other negative emotions. He needs to pass that on, and feels beating his kids and presumably his wife will do that. In my book, thats just not love. Its not. Love requires respect, trust, and empathy and thats clearly just not there. And realizing thats scary. Just remember, its not because you, your Brother or your Mom arent loveable. Its because he doesnt value that. And he really never will. No matter what his words say, they wont match his actions, will they? Hes not authentic or genuine. And its not out of his power to not beat on others. Does he do this at work? Does he beat his boss? What about the cop that gives him a speeding ticket? No? Thats because he can control it. He dumps on your guys because its easy. You deserve to be treated with respect. You do not owe your parents for having you or raising you. You do not need to be beat so that your Father can feel better about himself by being in control and ""powerful"". 

So I strongly suggest you reach out to some of those DV shelters and agencies. They can guide you on the best way to handle this in your area. You can also check out /r/raisedbynarcississts who have great resources in the sidebar, or /r/domesticviolence for their resources (I mod there too), or /r/abuse. 

You arent alone. This violence happens each and every day. Someone needs to stand up for your Brother to really help him. And you are going to need support. Its out there. You just have to reach out for it.

"dh2svb7","Even if this is supposed to be a part of something larger, it should have its own arc. You know what's supposed to happen as the author, so maybe to you, it seems like its fine. But you need to look and craft these things from *the perspective of the audience.* 

I'll use, say, Cowboy Bebop as an example. It's almost entirely a series of self-contained episodes, save for a few episodes that touch on this relationship between Spike and Vicious. But, the self-contained episodes are often iterating and riffing on some of the same overall themes that these connected episodes are built on. Or, when they aren't, they're carried on pure entertainment value. They *feel good*. They're flat out fun to watch. Or they revel in the absurd, which ties into the show thematically and also rides pure entertainment value.

Fallout: New Vegas does this as well. Side-quests seem self-contained, more or less, but they build on your understanding of the world and they often build on this theme of nostalgia for the Old World, or Old World Blues, as the game eventually puts it. All of the companion character side-quests riff on this theme of clinging to the past or moving forward, the factions all follow in this theme (whether its the major factions modeling their selves after Old World powers or the Brotherhood of Steel finding that they don't belong in the world anymore, so they either need to adapt or cling to the past and die). All of these side quests are self-contained, thus having their own arc and feel satisfying to complete, but also they build on the overarching theme of the game and give the player something to think about once everything is said and done.

You can do this with your own work. You can figure out what it is that you want it to be about and make build on those themes, even just from the start. If you have ideas and themes you want to explore, you can explore them from the start in whatever way you want, and tie it all into something more grand later if you're telling an overall story, or just keep riffing on them in different self-contained scenarios. The main, best thing to keep in mind though is that **if this is intended for an audience, you need to write it with the audience experience in mind.** Your ideas could be incredible, but the audience would never know it if you've written it to be impenetrable to them, or just so boring that it's unlikely they'll continue to read to get to the good parts.

As an example, I love the show Eureka Seven. Somewhere towards the middle of its run, it has a small arc with a couple of characters named Ray and Charles that culminates in some of the best TV I've ever had the pleasure of seeing. But, I can almost never recommend this show to anyone. The first ~10 to 15ish episodes are a chore. The show sort of acts like you should know who all the characters are already, or doesn't give you a whole lot to work with in terms of giving you something to come back for. For this reason, it took me from when it aired back in 2005 all the way until 2014 to finally finish the show from front to back. There was a ton of good there, but it was so, so difficult to get to it through the start of the show.

So, **Entertainment value.** Have you read Fiona Staples' and Brian K Vaughan's Saga? [The very first panel of the very first page oozes entertainment value, while also giving some great banter to help establish the characters and introduce us to the world.](http://www.cbr.com/saga-1-3/) This is a strong opening, and even if there is some lull to the comic afterwards (which there may or may not be depending on your tastes), its given you a taste of what it is and a promise of what its capable of delivering. This is a really great thing to have. If you're aware of Homestuck, it's the [GameFAQs FAQ that serves as the end of the comic's first Act](http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002149) that suddenly shows you how the comic will format itself: Lots of nonsensical goofing around until hitting an emotional climax that re-contextualizes the events you had just seen. This isn't at the start of the comic, but entertainment value carries the comic until that point, assuming you're into programming jokes and goofball shenanigans. But, this scene comes so comparatively late that it's likely you've already dropped the comic before getting to the ""good part"" if these jokes didn't carry the comic for you.

**Actual Advice and Critique**

Comics are hard, because, unless you have a writer or have an artist to partner with, you're doing both jobs, and the quality of the thing depends both on being well-written and well drawn (or at least some balance between the two that makes it palatable to read). I think that if you think in an actual episodic way, you could improve your writing a ton. With this comic, the arc would be ""how did Lasereye become Lasereye?"" It's potentially a pretty good premise, right? You'll establish a character and have plenty of chances to create entertaining scenarios because... It's your story! Lasereye became Lasereye in whatever way *you* decide he did. Go crazy, tell us a story! How did some young, bright-eyed, bushy-tailed kid turn into some dude in a slum with one eye glowing brighter than ever and the other dim and jaded? Telling this in three pages would actually be a great exercise. 

Your art is rough in that it looks like you could use learning some base fundamental things like human anatomy. Your palette and the food stand itself reminds me of [Kill Six Billion Demons](http://de8ib6lw8p0gm.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/ksbd53-54.jpg) though, which is great. You've created a good atmosphere in panels 1, 2, and the last panel on the last page, despite the artwork itself being rough. That's great! *You know how a thing should feel.* That's a great thing to have down pat that will only continue to be a boon as your technical skill improves (and it will if you work at it!). I think that if you buckle down and grind through learning how to draw, you could make very great, visually appealing work. 

There's a problem in page flow on Page 2. [Here I've shown how your page directs the eye with red lines.](http://imgur.com/rLbzfN5) The way the page is laid out, you end up reading the fifth panel before you read the fourth panel, which will cause a reader to have to double back to read things in order. You don't want that. You'll wanna keep an eye out for how your pages read in the future. Just give them a once-over and ask where the eye would naturally go following the lines on the page.

So, if you aren't currently, learning human anatomy would be a great place to start placing effort. If you have access, figure drawing classes and the such would be a great way to start working on that. It helps immensely to have others around who can help you if you aren't sure what you're doing at first. Books on comics in general would be a good place to go as well.

"dgwtmab","*In response to what Yao Wu had said, he gave a mere nod. Whether or not he chose to admit it, he supposed that was enough to give the dragon head some respect; but he still believed that he was vicious, nonetheless. Vicious, but respectable in a sense; Yao Wu was most certainly adept at convincing those around him that as an individual he held a respectable stance, even if it may truly not be the case. But Nayato of all people most certainly could not honour somebody so respectable; an envious trait, perhaps. For he could never convince anybody of his truth, no matter how hard he tried.* 

---

*Three questions, each weighing an equal burden upon Nayato's shoulders. One in which involved him; another in which involved Ruri; and the final, in which would drastically change the fate of everybody. It was most certainly something to think about, to consider; but Nayato needn't stall no time. He was done with this... this exam. These lessons. No longer did he want to hear such chilling words spoken again. Thus, he would act accordingly. He would act... based on what he believed, and nobody else. But of course, those opinions were most certainly vile.* 

*Nayato was about to respond, but upon hearing his fellow students' words, he stopped. Why... why were all of them except Izumi voting against his death? Why? Because he was a friend of theirs? Because they didn't want anymore death? Really... Really? Something seemed to latch onto the empty shell of his heart as these words echoed through his mind. But whom did they mistake him for? Truthfully, he had no future outside of here; just a bleak, empty slate of corrupted reality. He was despicable; utterly so. And one death alone could not atone for his sins. But then again... there was certainly far more than just that to consider. And with that, his decision was made. But something was awfully wrong about it...* 

""...I do not believe that I should be executed. M-Much as I am curious... no, I mustn't be executed..."" *The next question for him was entirely obvious. Ruri had done nothing wrong, truly. Not a single soul could predict the outcome; she was merely doing what she figured to be the best solution. An honourable decision she made, actually; to atone for one's own sins is most certainly a noble choice.* 

*And that's exactly why he would utter his next words.* 

""...I b-believe Ruri should be executed..."" *He clenched his fist as he spoke.* ""...She should d-die... for being s-such an 'honourable' Japanese citizen, and f-for shaming Master Mari... that is unacceptable."" 

*Finally, the last question. A forced, soft and yet pained smile would envelope his pale face at this. Considering the answer he gave in regards to the first question, the answer to this one was indubitable. Even if nobody agreed with him, just his belief was enough; for once, his belief would suffice. Because... even he knew he had no future past here.* 

""...I, not including the rest of t-the people that stand in this room... wish t-to stay at the castle. I.. cannot b-bring myself to leave this place... m-my former friends have died here, and thus I shall not abandon t-them here...

My first time watching this, my piece of shit friend fucking spoiled the ending to me the day the episode came out and I wasn't home yet to watch it.  I got so pissed I didn't watch the episode for a couple days to decompress but I eventually did and that letter fucking wrecked me...

Overall I thought the show was a fantastic roller coaster of emotions.  It was sad and vicious but at the end it was enjoyable.  

One weird thing I couldn't really drop was that the characters' ages kind made the story off.  If I had a chance to change it, I'd age them up to 3rd year high school.  Having middle school kids dealing with these adult issues just seems to fit more if they were older.

Telling Jon to play his idol, the Alec switch, the Jon vote out, and the Jaclyn idol play were all examples of her skill. She's a top tier winner for all these reasons.

2. Jeremy- Again, if the name of the game is control, he had it 100%. I have him just a hair below Nat because his game wasn't as outwardly vicious, but other than the Fischbach vote he wasn't really surprised by much.

3. Tony- Tony is widely considered by many to be a GOAT contender. Honestly, I don't think he's quite that good. But he's certainly excellent, and he made the most of his good fortune in the game. Add to that the fact that his FTC opponent was clueless and it's hard to fault him too much.

I tried it for Last Stand and I was very impressed: I was shredding players with 5500 Firearms, and surviving the unsurvivable with 3099 Stamina. That is, as long as Booster shot was active. 

Basically, he uses Vigorous, Savage, Specialized, and 3-pc Tactician. He aims for Skill Haste to be 45-50%, and for CHC to be near 55-60%.

The main stats are 5500 Firearms, 3099 Stamina, and 6400 Electronics (or 250k Skill Power) once he joins Last Stand. 

All gear mods are with Skill Haste, and performance mods are all First Aid self heal. 

Vest - Health and Skill Haste
Mask - Skill Power and Burn Resistance
Kneepads - Health, Burn, Bleed, Shock Resist
Backpack - Health, Burn / Bleed Resist
Gloves - SMG DMG, CHD, Skill Haste
Holster - Reload Speed

He runs Booster shot and either Scrambler pulse or a seeker mine, depending on the situation. Recon Pulse offers a little more CHC and CHD, scans an extra 20m distance, and the cooldown is much sooner. The downside is that it doesn't protect you from hostile pulses like the Scrambler does. 

He uses the Burst Fire MP5 because he is able to use his mouse wheel to help him shoot the 3-shot bursts much faster; however, that's not possible for me on console. This means that I chose the MP5 (ST or Navy). 

He mods the weapons with CHD as the major attribute, followed by CHC and headshot DMG as secondary attributes. The extended magazine has Rate of Fire instead of CHC. Again, because I'm on console, my accuracy isn't as great, so I went for more CHC on the magazine, over Rate of Fire. 

The weapon talents he suggests are Responsive, Competent, and Vicious, but I'm used to the benefit of having Competent on my sidearm, so I replaced Competent on the primary MP5 with Deadly, and the secondary MP5 has Unforgiving instead of Deadly. 

My sidearm is a 229 sawed off shotgun with Competent, Talented, and Determined. Whenever possible, I finish off players with the sidearms to activate Talented and Determined. I also always take advantage of Competent by popping Booster shot and quickly switching to my main weapon, but only after the Competent icon has appeared under my health bar (there's a delay!)

The player talents I use are On the Move, Strike Back, Precision if I'm not running pulse, or Chain Reaction if using the seeker mine, and Death by Proxy.

The American dream isn't dead it's different than it used to be. Before it could be achieved with a blue collar job, now it's a bit harder. This also varies by state, but at least in the bay area where I live it's close to impossible.

It means living in the ghetto in a dangerous neighbor‚Äãhood, where your kids will go to shitty schools creating a vicious but BREAKABLE cycle. This is what I mean the choices we make matter at an early age.

Could you flesh this out more? Why were they silly? What made these interactions awkward? *New Vegas* is renown for its grounded and nuanced factions. The NCR are ostensibly the good guys, attempting to maintain a structured government in the wastes, but they're overbearing domineering and corrupt. Cesar's Legion are vicious, but efficient, using unsavory means like slavery and militaristic might to achieve a degree of order. House is neutral and capitalistic, keeping his land through shady, but effective business. 

These all seem like perfectly reasonable factions, and their interactions stem reasonably from their goals.

&gt;I'm sure She can handle us at our worst and most vicious, but why would we want Her to?

Why wouldn't we? Looking at my mortal mother, when I was at my worst the last thing I wanted was for her to walk away and leave dealing with me to someone else. I needed *her* love, attention, and support, as much as my father's. Why should a child being difficult or even vicious justify a mother just 'not dealing with it'? If she can, why wouldn't she? And why wouldn't I want her to?

&gt;If our Father could prevent it, why wouldn't He?

Why would He prevent a Mother who is more than capable of handling us at our worst from supporting Her own children and proving She's there for them and loves Him? After all, He can prevent a lot of things and yet doesn't. Why is preventing Her from helping Her own children and proving Her love to them priority over preventing something like say- murder, rape, child starvation? 

&gt;I don't want to hear or see nonsense that seeks to tear down my husband, my child, my family regardless of how strong I know they are.

So if your child is in emotional pain and lashing out at your husband in anger, or even at you, in a situation you have the skills to be able to handle, you would rather walk away and ignore your child than help them or support them, just because you 'don't want to hear it?'

The Father can also handle the slings and arrows, and also doesn't have to. So why do we get the benefit of His influence and guidance but not the Mother's, when the same argument applies to both?

I'm not accusing, just trying to understand the logic.

&gt;Just because someone can handle slings and arrows doesn't mean they should have to.

It also doesn't mean not handling them is the wisest or most loving course *all* instances, does it?

&gt;Because we won't learn anything.

"de6cxbz","&gt; Maybe that multiplayer seems to be about cutthroat tryhards that only go for military victories, but Allayi are a subtle faction where timing and foresight is key.

It's about having fewer resources and units than everyone else, and thus being weaker. You're not a tryhard if you wipe out an Allayi-you're just taking advantage of a weak opponent. Advantages snowball when seized early. If Allayi were not so weak, this would not be a major issue.

&gt;taying relevant can be done by building as high as others, or kicking their castles down to size. In winter Allayi can blitz right through a whole region and strike a capital before anyone can react or catch them. Probably gamey, certainly underhanded, and wholly vicious, but if you find yourself getting overdone you could consider it.

Like I said-it's not that they can't work; it's that they don't work as well as the other factions. Anyone can blitz with the right equipment and upgrades, or be aggressive against other strong players. You can't tell me that they can better at this than other factions, though. ""They can still do this despite their drawbacks"" is not a mark in their favor. 

Really, the idea that you can blitz a capital in winter is also dubious. Works in SP if you have decked-out units AND if you happen to border the AI's capital. Otherwise? Close borders, spam and stop you. Blitz or no, it comes down to this: the stronger side wins, and the weaker loses. And tt it will not work in MP, period. 

And this all assumes that you can handle the massive expansion unhappiness from taking a few extra cities. You can once you get lots of high-level Allayi governors-but only late in the game, when you either don't exist or are too comparatively weak to make this viable.

"ddvqfbu","I played soccer since I was 6 and was pretty good at it. My high school team sucked though. We were the second-worst team in our 4a district because we were a poor high school in a poor part of town. But the population of our school still threw us into the 4a category, even though we barely had 20 girls each season. We had about 8 girls who could play well and the rest were new to the sport and doing it for fun, which is absolutely fine, but we were up against high schools in rich districts where girls had been playing together for years. 

We were treated pretty badly when we had out of town games. I remember sitting with my team on the bleachers behind the other team, and those girls would turn around and give us looks and take pictures of us for whatever reason. We would come in yellow school buses, which was hilarious to them, because they would got air conditioned Greyhound buses. Not all the teams were like this--maybe 70 percent were outwardly rude. We always had teams that didn't shake our hands or do the high-five line up at the end of the game.

We also had a problem of not having a dedicated coach. Our coaches cycled every year. And they were terrible.

Alternatively though, I had a history teacher who coached a high school soccer team out of town, which always pissed our team off because we wondered why we weren't good enough for him to coach. In class, he would openly mock how bad our school soccer teams were. His team though, was really good and elite. 

So the game against his team comes up. We arrive at their field. Their team keeps glancing over at us and laughing. The game starts and the girls are vicious but good. We're actually holding our own against them. Their referee is a son of a bitch though. These girls are ramming into us, shoulders and all and even illegal elbows and there's no calls, but any touch we make with them is instantly called on.

The girls are super smug and some even have the audacity to say shit to my team as we're playing. We'd mark up on them and they'd say, ""Ew, get off me! Get the hell off me you cow! Don't touch me!"" Unnecessary comments that wouldn't occur had they been playing a team they thought worthy of their caliber.

Anyway, our team is getting put out and pissed. We're getting unfair calls, the other team is full of assholes, and even the parents were being obnoxious. I'm frustrated and full of piss and vinegar. It's raining and its cold. A girl is coming toward me with the ball and tries to out run me but doesn't work. She tries some fancy foot work, but no dice. I go in to nudge her off the ball because I'm bigger than her and she clearly can't get passed me. ""Get the fuck off me!"" she screams and she's looking around for the ref. Instead, I just ram into her. She falls to the ground, shocked, with the ball under her legs. She tries getting back up, but I keep forcing her back into the mud with my knees and some kicks. I get the ball but I get a yellow card. The girl gets up and screams at me, ""What the fuck? Are you fucking stupid?"" The parents are booing me. I'm still angry, but I look over to my dad who is giving me a thumbs up and yelling, ""That'll teach her!"" 

My team mates decide to stop taking the piss and dish it. The ref actually stops giving us bogus calls for whatever reason. We lost the game but we got those girls' uniforms stupidly muddy and gross and at the end of the game, they weren't saying anything to us anymore. That game always stuck out to me.

"ddt1hks","Yeah..I've been saying this forever.  I didn't need to be a neuroscientist either.

Women are more socially alert and sensitive. They are more concerned with a guys social standing above all. Hence the prince fantasy that little girls develop from a young age. This is why women pay so much attention to social dynamics  and are sensitive to body language, emotions, etc. basically they are ""reading rank"". It's instinctual for them. 

If you look at the anatomy of the sexes and it's purpose you can see why it is this way.

Sex to a woman is life threatning and a major investment. The burden of bearing a child, going through birth and raising it. As a result sex is high risk to women so WHO they are having sex with matters MORE than the ACT of sex itself. 

However for men, the more women he sleeps with the better, the ACT alone benefits him.  It spreads his genes and costs him very little. Especially if some unknowing cuck supports and raises his seed (kid). So men just benefit from sex...pretty much any of it. Disturbing to think but odds are most family bloodlines, going back thousand of thousands of years, somewhere he is not your biological ""father"".  

Brutal and Vicious but it's a very human condition. We can witness your mother giving birth to you and we can visually witness 20 guys in 2 weeks have sex with your mother but not have any way of knowing who the father is (outside of modern technology) We can guarantee who your mother is, but your father...


In conclusion. Women do read rank and incel men are seen to rank at the bottom, that basically says in a women's brain ""avoid"". They will hold out as long as possible for a more Alpha partner or upgrade (female hypergamy) this is where most women initiate a divorce, you turn out to be a ""loser"" and are outranked by most men at this point. This is what the whole ""confidence"" thing is about that they speak of. They want you to display (real or not) social rank, prowess, comfort and dominance.

Edit: so when women say, ""I don't care about the sex it's who I'm with that makes it special"" they aren't lieing. They literally do think this.

As for character development, Jaime is of course complex, he loves/hates his father, and is relieved to no longer live under the man, but feels sorrow at the loss. He actually fell in love with Lysa Tully gradually, mainly because of their shared trauma at the hands of their fathers, and thus her death effected him greatly, making him more vicious, but also protective.

R1: Aragorn takes majority, but not by alot. The Hound is quite skilled and vicious, but Aragorn regularly fights Orcs, so he's used to it. Hound also fights dirty, which could prove to be an extra challane. 7/10 for Aragorn.

R2: Easy round for Aragorn. He fights off a damn Troll, and the show Mountain is nowhere near as strong. The Mountain is also sort of unskilled, relying on his strength to fight over anything else. 9/10 for Aragorn, barring an accident.

R3: Brienne has Oathkeeper, Aragorn might have some trouble here. I'm tempted to say it would be a push, but a totally in character Aragorn might underestimate her and get wrecked. 4/10 for Aragorn just on that premise.

"ddjclaz","I'm an Army veteran, so I can probably give a little insight to the guilt. Most people know they're joining an institution of killing, but because of society's view, it's justified. Kind of like being a samurai -- vicious, but honorable.

Two things. First, American society has a confluence of factors that minimize its war crimes: 

* Rabid devotion to the military during sporting events; 
* Presidents and other leaders profusely thanking the military for its service;
* Government leaders seldom admitting the viciousness of war; 
* Video games like Modern Warfare or Counter Strike that glorify combat; 
* Glory is given to WWII veterans and the war in general; 
* Our persistent propaganda machine churning out fear of terrorists. 

None of these are met with popular disgust, so a young man or woman can see that society gives it approval. For me, it was like, ""Joining the military must be a good thing because everyone says it's cool. I hear it's tough but so many people say we're fighting real bad guys. And I want to get rid of bad guys."" Plus, my family had been serving since WWII (in the Philippines, against the Japanese), so there was a general approval among my support network for joining.

So one joins expecting some rough times, but they never talk about the bad stuff that happens, especially in war. This leads into my second point, *moral injury*. 

Moral injury is an emerging field of study among therapists for veterans. It's similar to PTSD in the sense that it gives persistent feelings of guilt and shame for one's actions. It's different in that guilt or shame can last long after PTSD has been treated effectively (nightmares, startle responses, high anxiety). What we've known for a little while is that humans aren't programmed to be killing machines, and when we're forced to kill (or be in an institution of killing), it goes against our genetic makeup. Thus, it creates massive mental dissonance. 

Like, even if you killed a person for a good reason, one can still have moral injury. Imagine snuffing out a life in a tenth of a second, but always pondering about the family and community that raised him. That life took twenty or thirty years of growing up to come into this world, and with one swift action, he/she is gone. It goes against our sense of human beingness, and that guilt just *weighs* on you. **They never talked about it among all the propaganda.**

Nor did they mention it when recruited you. They never talk about how American imperialism is directed towards brown people, or how the machine lines the pockets of fat cats. So imagine the sheer surprise when you're faced with it. That's the guilt. In a way, it's a guilt for being gullible. 

As for me, I've made the most of my experience in Iraq. I joined thinking I could make a positive difference as a medic, where I wouldn't have to kill someone, but I later learned that I enabled the war machine. Yet, my experience and persistent questioning of that experience lead me to socialism.

The siege of Homs occurred after the protests were dispersed and it was already an active insurgency. Also, Islamists had already started to infiltrate the legitimate but small rebellion well before Homs.

That being said, Assad's use of indiscriminate shelling in the siege was vicious and unnecessary. He is a vicious dictator. However, he ran the country far better than any of the legitimate rebellion groups planned to, because the only groups that have been a legitimate threat were either Wahhabist, or controlled by the political opponents and high level defectors of Assad who were just as corrupt and power hungry. 

The sad fact is that because of the Iraqi chaos, the Arab spring protests in Syria were quickly infiltrated by Wahhabist terrorist groups, so we were never given a chance to see if those protests would have grown to the size of Egypt or Tunisia's protests. Keep in mind that there were also pro government protests in Syria in the tens of thousands in the major cities, so it wasn't as clear cut as the other two. Assad was a dictator who suppressed media and political dissent, so I do not condone him whatsoever, but under his rule, Syria had religious freedom, relative economic freedom and peace.

"dc07y9a","Wanton destruction of the personal privacy of any person who has ever come near a political organization is a vicious but effective means to smother dissent. This method is so common in Russia and the former Soviet states that it has a name: ‚Äúkompromat,‚Äù releasing compromising material against political opponents. Emails of dissidents are hacked, their houses bugged, the activities in their bedrooms videotaped, and the material made public to embarrass and intimidate people whose politics displeases the powerful. Kompromat does not have to go after every single dissident to work: If you know that getting near politics means that your personal privacy may be destroyed, you will understandably stay away.

Data dumps by WikiLeaks have outed rape victims and gay people in Saudi Arabia, private citizens‚Äô emails and personal information in Turkey, and the voice mail messages of Democratic National Committee staff members. Dissent requires the right to privacy: to be let alone in our vulnerabilities and the ability to form our thoughts and share them when we choose. These hacks undermine that crucial right.

Mass data releases, like the Podesta emails, conflate things that the public has a right to know with things we have no business knowing, with a lot of material in the middle about things we may be curious about and may be of some historical interest, but should not be released in this manner.

All campaigns need to have internal discussions. Taking one campaign manager‚Äôs email account and releasing it with zero curation in the last month of an election needs to be treated as what it is: political sabotage, not whistle-blowing.

These hacks also function as a form of censorship. Once, censorship worked by blocking crucial pieces of information. In this era of information overload, censorship works by drowning us in too much undifferentiated information, crippling our ability to focus. These dumps, combined with the news media‚Äôs obsession with campaign trivia and gossip, have resulted in whistle-drowning, rather than whistle-blowing: In a sea of so many whistles blowing so loud, we cannot hear a single one.

"dbib22b","Garrett Mattingly is thoroughly convinced that Machiavelli's *Prince* is meant to be satire, and it seems that he is the most prominent modern scholar to believe it and the one under the guidance of whom this theory has gained the most attention:

&gt; I suppose it is possible to imagine that a man who has seen his country enslaved, his life's work wrecked, and his own career with it, and has, for good measure, been tortured within an inch of his life should thereupon go out and write a book intended to teach his enemies the proper way to maintain themselves, writing all the time, remember, with the passionless objectivity of a scientist in a lab.

(Garrett Mattingly, ""Machiavelli's Prince: Political Science or Political Satire?,"" *The American Scholar* (Autumn 1958): 485. Cited in L. J. Andrew Villalon, ""Machiavelli's ""Prince"", Political Science or Political Satire?: Garrett Mattingly Revisited,"" *Mediterranean Studies* (vol. 12, 2003): 81.)

Mattingly also says that *The Prince* was written to shock the Medici by painting them as tyrants, and that choosing Caesare Borgia as an admirable example shows that this is satire, for Borgia was vicious but incompetent. (See Andrew Villalon article above, p. 82.) There were apparently also thinkers who believed *The Prince* was satire as early as 16th century; Mattingly refers to Alberico Gentilli, who was a teacher of civil law at Oxford under Elizabeth I (*Ibid.*: 83).

But Andrew Villalon thinks Mattingly is wrong:

&gt; Nevertheless, while all of these points are valid, and raise important questions concerning the author's state of mind at the time he wrote *The Prince*, they do not, as Mattingly would have us believe, inexorably lead us to the conclusion that the work must be satire.

(*Ibid.*: 84.)

For Andrew Villalon, saying that the amount of critics considering Machiavelli as serious is a point against Mattingly would be an appeal to authority/majority, and that much is true. You can't discard an opinion because it's an outlier. However, the fact is that most actual satire has been recognized as such by a majority of readers from the time it was published, which is not the case for Machiavelli's *Prince*. (Again, not super solid or conclusive point, as satire was used a lot to have works go under the censorship radar and this is also an appeal to majority.)

However, Andrew Villalon cites Machiavelli super famous letter in which he describes his retired way of life and explains the project of writing something that closely resembles the *Prince*, that he calls ""On Princedoms"", and the fact that Machiavelli has no ironic or satirical undertone when he says he wants to study prince rulers, what kinds they are, how they keep themselves in power and how they fall, leads him to believe that it's not very likely that *The Prince* was satire. (*Ibid*.: 86-87.)

Multiple letters also mention Machiavelli seeking for a job within the Medici rule. Like, pretty desperately seeking. That's how Andrew Villalon also explains the differences in the *Discourses* and *The Prince* regarding church ruling:

&gt; If one assumes that *The Discourses* represents Machiavelli's ""real"" position
on the Church's role in Italy, then how can one reconcile with it the author's mild, almost complimentary statement in *The Prince*? One does so by remembering that ""his holiness, Leo X"" (1513-1521) was a Medici pope, elder brother of the man to whom Machiavelli originally intended to dedicate his book, uncle to the actual dedicatee, and a potential employer.

(*Ibid.*: 91.)

Andrew Villalon thinks that the Borgia argument is invalid because Mattingly overestimates Machiavelli's tact and historical knowledge (which I consider quite sketchy of an attack, but well). According to Andrew Villalon (and the authors he cites), Machiavelli was very willing to bend history to fit his political agenda, so he did not really care that Borgia was not really a good ruler. (*Ibid*.: 91-92.) It is also emphasized that Machiavelli's belief in the corrupted nature of man is echoed in the *Discourses*, and that Machiavelli believed in a republic only if the people was virtuous, which he believed was true of the Roman people in the past, but was not true of his people around his time. (*Ibid*.: 93-95, 99.) As such, Machiavelli's positions on republicanism in the *Discourses* and *The Prince* are not contradictory.

Furthermore, other specialists of Machiavelli and Renaissance politics have argued that Mattingly misinterpreted Machiavelli in multiple occasions, and thus been led to see in him a very positive light, which made him read intentions in Machiavelli's work which do not hold up to careful examination:

&gt; Yet Mattingly goes too far when he tries to portray Machiavelli as a valiant republican stalwart who, having been beaten down by the vicissitudes of fortune, nevertheless defied his enemies in the only way left him, by writing a bitter lampoon against them. Here, historical sympathy led Mattingly to portray the subject in a better light than he deserved and to do so in the teeth of the evidence. His essay seems to be an exercise in wishful thinking, advancing the belief that Machiavelli was in fact opposing tyranny through satire. Here one sees historical sympathy pushed beyond what the facts will support: unless carefully reined in, it may obfuscate as much as it illuminates.

(*Ibid.*: 97.)

While this is just one rebuttal of the ""satire"" thesis, I think it is enough to put solid doubt into Mattingly's perception. I don't think Andrew Villalon is 100% right in his assertion that Machiavelli was extremely desperate to please the Medici, but I don't think Machiavelli hated them or wanted revenge or whatever. I think he was genuinely sympathetic to their reign and that, like the Prince he describes in his book, he tried his best to take advantage of the system before the Medici rule, but that got him flagged as an enemy of the Medici against his will when they came into power. I don't think Machiavelli truly believed his book would get him back into the favours of the Medici, but he genuinely believed the Medici prince to be a potentially good ruler for Florence, so he tried his best to make a book he would want to read and take inspiration from.

Another appeal to authority (I know, not the best) is that through my college philosophy classes, the ""satire"" hypothesis was not even brought up by my teacher when we did a very detailed reading of *The Prince*. I think that my teacher would've clearly touched a word on that if he thought it was credible, because he seemed to be fascinated by Machiavelli. But that's just anecdotal at that point.",1482422291,"mattingly also says that *the prince* was written to shock the medici by painting them as tyrants, and that choosing caesare borgia as an admirable example shows that this is satire, for borgia was vicious but incompetent.","vicious but incompetent","vicious","but",FALSE,"vicious but incompetent","incompetent",NA,NA,1

This method is so common in Russia and the former Soviet states that it has a name: ‚Äúkompromat,‚Äù releasing compromising material against political opponents. Emails of dissidents are hacked, their houses bugged, the activities in their bedrooms videotaped, and the material made public to embarrass and intimidate people whose politics displeases the powerful. Kompromat does not have to go after every single dissident to work: If you know that getting near politics means that your personal privacy may be destroyed, you will understandably stay away.""

"daz4g8s","So... it's exactly my critical thinking that made me aware of the brigading before I even looked at your profile. I don't like to brag, but you kind of contradicted yourself there.

But I don't mind. You didn't do as good a job defending Trump as you think you did, so the more people see this the better.

Anyways. I'll do it. I'll reply once more just to make things clear...

---

&gt;I said that how is anyone supposed to know if there is no signs of resisting, and they ""let him do it"", that is in no way saying sexual assault is okay if they didn't resist.

The thing is: you're saying that all the girls Trump touched wanted to be touched by him. But because he didn't discriminate at all (""***I don't even wait.*** *And when you're a star they let you do it. You can do anything.*""[[1]](https://youtu.be/C-Rr7CO59HY?t=1m5s)), this inevitably boils down to **an assumption that *all* beautiful girls want to be touched by him.** Can you really not see how completely fucking ridiculous that is?

Maybe some wanted it, who knows. But it's very likely that others didn't. You just can't know. And this lack of knowledge (when you just walk up to a girl and you haven't even talked to her) is why no decent person would just ""grab her by the pussy"" out of nowhere. But according to his own ""locker-room talk"" that's exactly what Trump did, and then he relied on his status as a star to not get called out on it. That's an admission to sexual assault, nothing else.

---

If you think Trump clearly condemns the Tiananmen Square massacre (and yes, I'm aware he used the words ""horrible"" and ""vicious"", I didn't ignore them), then why the fuck did he follow that up with that line about ""the power of strength""? Please explain that to me.

The context I was referring to is this: We both know that Trump likes to play the strongman. We both know that he admires Putin and other autocrats. And that he wanted to reintroduce waterboarding, until his own guy convinced him otherwise ‚Äì this alone proves that Trump is willing to go to some lengths of ""horrible""ness, as long as he thinks ""it works"".

So what he really said is: **""The Tiananmen Square massacre was horrible and vicious... *but it got shit done.*""**

That does not mean he'll start slaughtering protesters, of course. I'm not saying that. But it means that his line of thinking is basically, ""The Chinese government had a problem with these protesters, and they acted with *strength*, and it worked for them."" ...And that's a dangerous, ""the ends justify the means""-type of thinking, which is reflected in his proposals to kill terrorists' families and to reintroduce waterboarding.

---

Wrapping up:

1) Misleading phrasing: ""rape"" usually means sex; but fully valid if replaced with ""sexual assault"". Condemnable either way. Not based on fake news.

2) Misleading phrasing: he didn't praise the massacre, he just alluded to its ""effectiveness"". Worrisome either way. Not based on fake news.

3) Completely true. No matter if throwing tomatoes is technically assault, no matter how agreeable or disagreeable it may be: [it's a historically used form of protest](http://www.bonappetit.com/entertaining-style/trends-news/article/history-protest-foods). Not fake news.

4) Completely true. You struggled to come up with excuses for *why* he said that, but let's be real here: Donald always speaks his mind. Almost compulsively so. There's no rational reason to assume he didn't speak his mind in this FOX interview. Not fake news.

There's a lot of cool stuff going on in there, but from my own behavioral research and such, I am still bothered by the notion of 100% Evil intelligent creatures, as a default part of their existence. I once planned a Gnoll Barbarian in the day, who would've slowly shifted from ""just above baby eating"" to ""vicious but ultimately good warrior,"" so I'm not super keen on all this.

In my campaign though, Gnolls were introduced right after I got Volo's, and I incorporated it in so far as I had the gnolls all wear restraining bolts attached to their necks, which suppress their hunger and quiet the voices- they were intelligent and non-Chaotic Evil, but only because of these devices.

"daitupe","SC is incredibly cheap. There's no obligation whatsoever to spend any real money on any additions beyond the game itself. All ships, components, weapons ad infinitum will be available *exclusively* for in-game currency when the game is released. 

Currently people (such as myself) are spending additional real-world money both because SC is an entirely crowd-funded project *(i.e. we are where the money actually comes from)* and because we believe very strongly *in it*.

As for the person claiming it's ""just as pay to win as no mans sky"", I wouldn't pay much attention to people like that. 

Firstly this is because NMS isn't even pay to win; so far you buy the game and that's it, as far as I'm aware there is no real-money-purchasable advantage in NMS.

Now the *concern* for SC to be pay-to-win weather now or in the future is real; it's something us players regularly discuss. Because at the moment someone with $500 to spare can purchase, for example, a Corvette, a Frigate, maybe even a Capital, depending on how they go about it, which I personally cannot attain.

But secondly, and the element that people like your other respondent won't get to, is that these ships are going to require crew, maintenance, upkeep, protection etc. (SC is in many ways a *space sim* before it's a game).

So for example, an individual with a trust-fund fortune can buy a completionist pack *right now*, and you might say they've *""won""* SC, there's no hope for anyone else and what's the point of even trying?

Well you have to remember 2 things. There's no ""winning"" in Star Citizen any more than there's ""winning"" in life. 

I'll elaborate. My goal, my game, my ""win"" in Star Citizen has essentially already happened, it could be done already; I have my modest, used-looking medium cargo hauler (my Millenium Falcon) which I can walk around in, play with the components, hop in the turret, head out to an asteroid field, land on one and explore etc etc.

I'm part of a 500+ strong fleet of my countrymen and I can fly around with them, accidentally crash into them, accidentally shoot them in the face when we're drunk and not communicating effectively on comms, and it's all insanely awesome, hilarious and picturesque at the same time.

As the game progresses I want to move up the ranks of my fleet, probably put together a more focussed team to go out on specific adventures and missions within the fleet and eventually qualify to be a sort of guide or mentor for new players.

... but I essentially do that already; new players come on and I often take them aboard my ship, show them around and have a laugh; as do hundreds of other players at the moment.

By comparison I know there are players who want more than anything to become the big wigs of the game; to be head of the most powerful fleet, the most opportune miner, the most sought-after trader or the most feared pirate. Everyone's game is different and we're all going to affect each other.
But a single player is *not* going to be able to run a capital ship on their own, otherwise who's gonna be in charge of engineering? Who's gonna man the weapons? How are you going to distribute your shields? Essentially you might have bought yourself an aircraft carrier, but if 3 people in my tiny inflatable dinghy can sneak on without you even noticing..... what's the point?

For example I'll want to run some reasonably, but not overly, dangerous cargo (whether that be because of value or route) in my pretty tiny cargo hauler. A pirate-like player might see me and want my shit, but he's not going to blow me out of the sky because there goes my cargo too. So he hails me on comms and says ""stuff. Give. Now. Or dead."" etc. etc. 

Now I can decide ""yeah look, im gonna lose this shipment but at least me and my crew won't die"".... OR I could hail the rest of my fleet, maybe the 3 fighters I have not too far away to drop in and scare the shit out of this guy. 

All of this ""emergent gameplay"" is going to spiral and stack up and evolve, and so much of it is already there. With all these things together it honestly boggles my mind that anyone would even bother with this NMS stuff. Hell we already have a vicious but hilarious and fun rivalry between two of the biggest fleets in the community; *Test Squadron* and *Imperium*.

But at the end of the day, if you're looking for that straw to break your camel's back, if you're considering getting into the game but can't quite justify it yet, what I've found in the few months since I started *(during which I've already dropped $110+)* is that it's an amazing community; for a completely solo player, and one who doesn't engage with the meta community at all, it *will* feel very lonely. 

But if you're thinking about making that plunge, you can PM me whenever you like and I'll point you to everywhere you need to be *(and just btw, I think right now, during development, is one of the most fun times to get involved: everyone's pumped about what's to come, we're all arguing about what's gonna be what and who'a gonna be the best etc etc etc, but ultimately we're all just mega fuckin excited and plain happy that this is happening)*

Other than willful distortion, it's hard for me to understand how you could construe what I wrote above as an invitation to make ""vicious attacks"" on your lama. It's unlikely that you misread my statement, because I have asked you to help him out before and even [alerted](https://www.reddit.com/r/Buddhism/comments/4dvygl/does_karma_exist_in_this_life_eg_will_doing/d1wpbzy/) you to the possibility that he may incur heavy karma on himself. Why did you spin my request and concern into something hateful and vicious? Am I unreasonable to continue seeing you as dishonest/disingenuous? Doesn't this episode (let's also not forget ""internet growth"" and other spins) weaken if not invalidate your testimonial that GMR successfully got you to practice virtue? If you continue to conduct yourself in this way, I'm not sure how you'd enter the stream, bud.

Since you keep spinning, let's reflect on Khenchen Thrangu Rinpoche's teaching: ""However, faith in one‚Äôs guru does not mean blind faith. It does not mean believing ‚ÄúMy guru is perfect,‚Äù even though your guru is not perfect. It is not pretending that your guru‚Äôs defects are qualities. It is not rationalizing every foible of the guru into a superhuman virtue. After all, most gurus will have defects. You need to recognize them for what they are."" 

Not sure if stating the observable facts that he regularly lied to his audiences or that his method doesn't work is vicious, but at least it's grounded in reality. How vicious is it if you help him quit lying, or help him recognize his deluded views? No less than the Dalai Lama has said: ""If students sincerely point out the faults of the guru and explain any contradictory behavior, this will, in fact, help the guru to correct that behavior and adjust any wrong actions."" If I'm ever a teacher (certainly not in this lifetime), I sure hope at least one student would be intelligent enough to recognize my faults and mistaken views, and caring enough to point them out.

&gt; a treasured teacher of mine

It's just lip service, unless you help him out, starting with his seemingly habitual lying which you're trying to spin into ""skillful means"".

""Avoiding all deceit and cunning‚Ä¶ this is a Bodhisattva.‚Äù ‚Äì Gampopa

""One of the most important behaviours of a Bodhisattva is to always be kind, to be gentle, to be a good example, so therefore one of the many things that a Bodhisattva has to be very watchful of is his or her speech.‚Äù ‚Äì 17th Karmapa Trinley Thaye Dorje

""My realization is higher than the sky but my observance of karma is finer than grains of flour.‚Äù ‚Äì Padmasambhava

"da1md0s","The biggest religion in my world is an as-of-yet unnamed monotheistic religion that worships an all-powerful god. They believe in other gods, but see their god as the rightful lord of the cosmos and believe that it is their divine duty to convert infidels. Various other sects exist that believe that their god is the ONLY god, that all other gods are manifestations of the moon-god of evil, and a couple of weird syncretic sects.

There's also widespread philosophy/religion thing that essentially says that everything in the universe is an emanation from the original spark of creation (which is still around) and that you can become a higher being through meditation and bringing yourself closer to the origin. This religion is probably closest to the truth.

The most widespread (and developed) pantheon is probably that of the steppe peoples of the west. Its gods are kind of scary and probably like to eat babies. Here are a couple:

-Orz of the Snakes: The lord of all snakes, who is said to appear as a man with snake tails instead of limbs and a head. If you kill a snake in his domain, he'll send his children (horrifying half-snake abominations) to murder you in your sleep. 

-The Man in the Mound: A man who is said to have discovered the secrets of the cosmos and rebelled against the heavens. He was eventually impaled on metal spikes and divided into five pieces, which were buried beneath mounds. He's prayed against rather than to.

-Ersal the Rider: The goddess of warfare, archery, horse-riding, and destruction. She's vengeful, irritable, and vicious, but fairly reasonable otherwise. She loves warfare but cares nothing for glory, and is said to intervene in great battles on the side of the loser for fun. She appears as a woman with red skin and gray markings, who rides on a six-legged horse.

There's another deity whose worship was once spread throughout the steppe, that being Golba, the One whose Veil is the Sky. A god who is said to live ""behind the sky"" (whatever that means) and rule every world.

"d9eyuit","Gordon pulled the note off the door, crumpled it up, and tossed it into the bushes. He knew what it said and who it was from. Missy Joyner - complaining about the raccoons again. 

Too bad. It was his house and his life and his goddamn cat food. Besides, raccoons were just part of the cost of living in the suburbs...or the city...or the country. Well, they were just part of the cost of living, that's all. No use crying about it. 

He'd started feeding the raccoons after Georgia had died. Georgia was his cat. His wife Ally had been dead for ten years, but that was no great loss. Georgia, though, was about as good a kitty as you could ask for. Calm and simple, she hardly ever asked for anything. Never complained. Not even as that tumor had started growing up along the inside of her throat. It got so bad she could hardly swallow. The weight loss was the only sign Gordon ever picked up on and by then it was much, much too late.

So Georgia was gone and Gordon had a big old bag of cat food left in the pantry. He considered getting a new cat, but he was old and indifferent to the people, places, and things he wasn't already fond of or used to. New things were a hassle. Gordon was too old for hassles. But there were strays in the neighborhood and that seemed like the kind of relationship Gordon could stand - distant benefactor. Stray cat philanthropist. So he took a scoop of food and left it on his back steps one night. Somewhere in the middle of the night he heard scratching and munching and the clitter-clap of little, long nails on half-rotten wood. He peeked out the window to see who his customer was. 

It was a trio of raccoons. 

Gordon was honestly disgusted. Raccoons have those nimble little paws - disturbingly dexterous. Too human-like. And those black eyes see entirely too much. Wild and clever and vicious. 

But the raccoons seemed pleased with the offering. They cleared the lot, licked their hands and faces, and disappeared back into the dark.

And Gordon...Gordon still had plenty of cat food left.

The trouble - if you were the sort who cared about these things - was that Missy Joyner saw Gordon dumping the cat food out on his back steps one night. She lived on the opposite side of the fence and happened to be a snoop. Suddenly she had someone to blame every time raccoons or other woodland creatures made a move on her trash bins. 

""I'll call animal control, I will!"" she'd once barked across the fence.

""Call 'um!"" Gordon had croaked back. ""They ain't my pets.""

And they weren't. Raccoons are subservient to no one and Gordon certainly didn't expect any sort of thank you. He just liked to watch them eat. He'd gotten past that initial revulsion and turned around to finding them a fascinating species. Survivors. Just like Gordon. They didn't care what anyone thought of them. Just like Gordon. 

*Peas in a pod*, Gordon mused one day, as he watched a half dozen scuffle and wrestle over that night's pile of dry kibble. 

And so Missy Joyner's notes all went in the same place - the trash, or the street, or the bushes, or once - when Gordon had been particularly peeved - straight up the old man's own asshole. He'd regretted it later, upon extraction, but it had been a singularly triumphant moment, which he swore to cherish until the day he died.

The note so deposed of, Gordon unlocked the door and stepped inside his home.

He was not alone.

Two men stood inside the house, one holding Gordon's television with an almost sheepish look on his face; the other standing just outside the bathroom, tugging something out of his pocket.

""What the hell is this?"" cried Gordon, too stupid with anger to think to turn and run. The man with the TV stammered something incoherent, while the other produced a gun and defiantly waved it in Gordon's face.

""Close the door, old man,"" said the one with the gun. ""Or I swear I'll blast you in the face.""

Gordon sighed, his anger still simmering, but his age catching up to him. ""Whatever. Take what you want. It's all crap anyway.""

""We will,"" said the man with the gun. ""But first...""

They locked the door and tied Gordon to a chair. The sheepish man suggested that they run, but the man with the gun just laughed. 

""He's seen our faces,"" he said with a grin. ""He's gotta die. You know that, right?""

The sheepish man shook his head. ""I don't think he'll...""

""He won't,"" agreed the other. ""He'll be dead. But first, I wanna try a few things.""

He set the gun on the kitchen table and pulled a chunky switchblade out of his waistband. ""You ever peel an apple in one, single drag?"" he asked his partner.

The sheepish man turned pale. ""I didn't... look, I just wanted some easy cash. I didn't...""

""We'll still take all the good stuff,"" said the man with the switchblade. ""I just wanna see how much of his face I can peel off in a single strip.""

Gordon was scared - he was old, not stupid - but resigned to death. Even resigned to torture. He promised himself he wouldn't scream. That's what the sicko with the knife wanted. So that's the one thing Gordon wouldn't give him.

Gordon was repeating that silent mantra - *Don't scream. Don't scream* - when he spotted a pair of shining, black eyes at the back window. 

""It's dinnertime, isn't it?"" he said absently. 

""No dinner for you, old man,"" said the man with the switchblade. ""No dinner ever again.""

""It's not my dinnertime,"" said Gordon, watching, fascinated as the knob on the backdoor began to twist. They couldn't get in, of course. The door was locked. But how strange that they would try. ""Must be hungry,"" he muttered.

""Me?"" said the man with the switchblade, leaning down over Gordon's face. ""I'm not a cannibal. I'm not going to *eat* you. I'm just curious, that's all.""

Gordon shifted his head to see past the man. ""Christ. Did they find the spare key under the mat? Well, I'll be...""

""We broke in through the bedroom window,"" said the sheepish man. ""We thought you worked Thursday nights. That's why...we...you know.""

Gordon smiled. ""The whole family's here.""

""He's freaking me out,"" said the sheepish man. 

""He's just fuckin' with us,"" said the switchblade man. ""Ignore him.""

""Use the gun,"" said Gordon, squirming in his seat and pointing with his chin. ""Point and pull the trigger.""

""*Knife*,"" said the switchblade man, pushing the edge up against Gordon's throat. ""You don't get the gun until I'm done havin' fun. Oooh. That rhymed."" He turned to face the sheepish man. ""Did you hear th...""

*BANG.*

The right side of the switchblade man's face detached itself in the blink of an eye, splattering against the wall and the door and quite a good deal of Gordon. The remainder of the switchblade man stumbled, buckled at the knees, and collapsed to the floor. 

The sheepish man screamed. 

""They need to kill you, too?"" asked Gordon, nodding at the space just behind the frightened thief. The sheepish man turned slowly. A trio of raccoons were standing on the kitchen table, holding the handgun, which smoked faintly as the muzzle drifted towards the sheepish man. 

""Oh *fuck*!"" shouted the sheepish man. 

""Untie me,"" said Gordon. The sheepish man did as he was told. Gordon rubbed his arms and back. ""Take the body with you. And don't come back.""

The sheepish man nodded, bending to scoop up the dead body off the floor. Bowed under the weight, he stumbled out of the house through the backdoor and disappeared forever.

Gordon turned to the kitchen table, where the raccoons had dropped the gun and were looking around rather expectantly. 

""Well, I think you've earned a bit of a feast tonight, my friends,"" said Gordon with a smile. ""Let's go see what we have in the pantry.""     ",1477888490,"wild and clever and vicious.","clever and vicious","vicious",NA,FALSE,"clever and vicious","clever",NA,NA,0

"d9acvgj","The problem is that Trump's ""scandals,"" much like the man himself, are straightforward and easy to understand. Like that conversation with Billy Bush, everyone knew what was being said.

"d8tudg1","My understanding is as follows: Pretty sure we're being lied to and probably also on the Ruskie side, but that is not the point of this post.  She's not the first person to visit and say so.  I tried to find a link from another Western journalist who states basically the same thing.

There is a strong requirement to manage the story on the Western side but especially now.  The US wants to kick out Assad and have for years.  They support rebels there which have a chance of toppling the regime including the Al Q affiliated ones, calling them ""moderates"".  I think they were the ones who executed a five year old kid recently.  (I'm sure their handlers told them to tone it down after that.)

Right now the rebels in Syria are held up in the Western part of Aleppo.  The Russians, Iranians, Syrians etc will route them but brutally with many civilian casualties.  The rebels, though, are not allowing the local population to leave.  

In order to justify providing heavier weaponry to the rebels they must be moderates and the Russians/Syrians/Iranians must be barbarians.  The US will never admit to providing weaponry to an al-q affiliated group. So they *must* lie.  There are probably legal repercussions too.  This is why the Americans are turning up the volume right now.  They must do something or they lose Syria to the Russians and their pals.

The best explanation I've read for the background is that the Americans wish to halt Chinese and Russian plans for a new ""Silk Road"" of trade across Europe, North Africa and the Middle East.  (Ukraine is on the other end, hence the orange revolution and coup.)  They also want to promote certain pipelines to Europe to break the Russian monopoly on European gas.  That way the Europeans wouldn't be so ""soft"" on the Russians.  

The Americans wish to break Russia to weaken China because their status as the primary unchallenged global super power will end in decades.  China's GDP/capita is increasing fast and combined with their huge population (plus Russia's weaponry technology) means by virtue of their economic might they'll be a significant rival--which the US will not tolerate by policy.

This is why the Americans are all about crocodile tears right now.  Does John Kerry honestly care about the aid convoy that was destroyed?  Of course not.  They don't give a crap about anyone in most of the Middle East and prefer chaos to any leader out of their orbit.  The last decade has proven that. 

The Russians are likely equally brutal and vicious.  But right now, they can claim the high ground because they are fighting terrorists and love pointing out that the Americans are fighting *with* Al Qaeda.

There is nobody decent left.  Pity the people of the Middle East.

"d8tpj18","While there is some disagreement, my understanding is that it is widely accepted that negative evaluation is essential to words like *greed*, *selfishness*, *viciousness*. 

For example, if I call you ""greedy, selfish, and vicious"", I have insulted you. If I tell someone else that you are a ""greedy, selfish, vicious, but ultimately good person,"" they would be justified in inferring that you must have some good qualities that outweigh your greediness, selfishness, and viciousness. If I simply say that you are greedy, selfish, and vicious, an interlocutor may justifiably come to the conclusion that you are a jerk. And as we all know, one ought not to be a jerk, which is to say that it is bad to be a jerk.

If you're interested, this is connected to the concept of thick moral concepts which play a large role in virtue ethics and was a major point in Putnam's moral realism. I think it was first investigated by Bernard Williams and was inspired by Ryle's *thick descriptions*. 

Edit: a consequence of a thick moral concept X, (and what might be bothering you)  is that we may have to say that *nothing is X*. So, from under error theory, if greed is necessarily bad, and nothing is bad at all, then there is no such thing as greed. Or, taking chastity and a more modern sense of morality, we may say that no one is chaste because no one ought to be positively valued on the basis of their lack of sexual experience. So we may say that a certain evaluation is analytically derived from a term, it is up for grabs as to whether anything happens to ""fulfill"" that term.

"d8qv5st","In the last half month since the 2016/17 preseason began,  your rookie has been involved in numerous incidents that would be considered dirty by any unbiased source. As far as I've been tracking I've seen one vicious elbow followed by numerous violent cross checks; some fairly vicious, but arguable boarding incidents; a textbook slew foot which anyone here who played competitive hockey knows is dangerous; followed by pressing that obviously injured players face into the ice.

And it's been, what, 5 games for him?

In contrast Lucic has done, what, fight Engelland? Bringing up Lucic, when the whole of /r/hockey is criticizing Tkachuk's play, isn't exactly a sound argument.

Tkachuk has a a lot of skill, and a lot of us who love hockey want to see him play. We're excited for your team to have him. With that said he is also making some very dirty plays, consistently. Unfortunately right now, the only thing people are talking about are his dirty plays. It's a shame. It's also a shame that if he keeps doing it someone is going to do something dirty back.

""Good agitators"" do their job without injuring other players. ""Good agitators"" know where the line is drawn. Right now Tkachuk isn't be a ""good agitator"", he is being a goon. I think we're all hoping he smartens up and moves  towards the other side.

Time passed slowly for Gerald.  He was thankful for his nap earlier now because he would not be able to sleep with her present now.  The whole time she sat in silence, just warming herself by the fire.  Her eyes never rose to meet his after the initial conversation and he was also thankful for that.  He did not need yet another pair to haunt him.  Gerald stood up and picked up his blade.  The sudden movement startled the girl and backed away into a crouched position.  The tension hung in the air for a moment before Gerald sheathed his blade and took his extra layers that had been drying by the fire.  He dressed in silence as the girl simply stared at him, no doubt waiting for him to do something horrible to her, the fear was clear in her eyes.  Gerald cursed to himself yet again.  Unlikely he would forget those eyes now.  They would join the army of others who judged him.

When he was finished he took his seat by the fire once more but did not return to tending it.  It had been only a few hours, there were still many more to come before the moon rose but they could not keep the fire the whole night.  When midnight came, any light source, no matter how miniscule would be noticeable.  The girl still had not taken her seat since falling back into a defensive position.  Crouching down behind the fire, Gerald now had a much better view of her.  Her hair was a light brown and uneven, she must have cut it herself.  What caught Gerald's attention were her eyes, a dull orange iris.  She was not from these lands but a native of Akad.  Akad was not part of the kingdom, the poor nomads must have been taken by quite the surprise when the Shade fell.  They had no other investment in the kingdom and probably knew little of princess or the shadow lord.

Gerald opened his mouth to ask her something when the barn door creaked.  Two small red dots peered in from the darkness.  Small and beady, the threat they posed was subtle.  Gerald immediately drew his blade and faced the eyes.  From the corner of his eye he could see that the girl had backed away from the light of the fire, light reflected off a knife in her hand.  The eyes were completely silent, but slowly a second pair appeared. Four, then six, then eight.  Eight small red dots, perfectly motionless in the night.  The only consolation of their numbers meant they couldn't be that large if they fit in the doorway.

Gerald held the hilt of his blade close to his hip.  If they were small enough to enter simultaneously, advancing was the wrong move.  If they were not, it was their best bet at survival.  Slowly a red crease formed underneath the first pair of eyes.  It crept open to reveal a row of razor blades glowing red.

""Red fangs!"" 

The girl hissed.  She lept forward and tried to slam the barn door closed.  With little time to react, Gerald lunged forward to protect her side as one of three red fangs dove into the room.  Gerald turned to face it hoping that girl had managed to close the door in time to prevent the others from coming in.

The red fang made no noise as it turned to face Gerald.  Its entire body was a blurry mass of black.  It was an amorphous blob in the vague shape of a hyena, the only sharp features were its red eyes, mouth and teeth.  The crisp red lines made it seem as if its face was merely projected onto the black mass as opposed to being part of it.

The beast attacked without warning, silently lunging at Gerald's neck.  Side-stepping the attack, he swung his sword around to make a downward slash at the creature's side.  The blade passed through the mass as if it were a mere shadow, the only sign of progress was the bright red patch of blood that now stained the blade and the ground beneath it.  Gerald gave it no time to recover, bringing his blade upward and thrusting where its neck would be.  This time there was an audible hiss as blood ejected from the creature as if under pressure, staining Gerald's outer garments and face.  The black mass collapsed and turned into a dull black furry mess, the red face no longer projected so there was no telling which end was which.

Gerald received no time to enjoy his victory as the sound of shattering wood suddenly registered in his ears.  In the mean time, the other three red fangs had done serious damage to the door. The girl could do little more than jab her knife at black masses when they were exposed but that risked losing a hand.  The door exploded as the three burst though head first.  Their paws making no sound as they landed.  The girl wasted no time engaging the one nearest her but the other two were firmly locked on Gerald and approaching quickly.

Gerald retook his defensive stance but this time did not wait to counter.  He struck first.  Both red fangs reacted, both unwilling to risk being his target.  Missing, Gerald spun around to find the beasts already ready to return the favor.  One lunged in much the same way as the first had and Gerald countered in turn but that left him little time to counter the second's lunge.  Instead he jumped out of the way and quickly climbed back to his feet.  The red fangs were on top of him as soon as he was back up.  This time they attacked in unison and Gerald was forced to dive underneath both of them.  He got to his feet and swung his blade behind him as fast as he could but ultimately failed to hit both.  At the very least he finally had some distance between him and the beasts and that was at least something.  He lowered the point of his blade to the ground half way between him and the creatures and waited for inevitable dual lunge.  Vicious but unintelligent, the red fangs lunged once more.  In one upward sweep Gerald succeeded in hitting both, spraying more blood across the barn.  He turned to finish off the one still standing, bringing the blade down onto its face.  The horrible sound of it dying nearly drowned out the girl's warning.

""Watch out!""

She yelled as she sprinted from the doorway where the body of the red fang she had been fighting was left collapsed on the ground.  Gerald spun around but could not get his blade up in time as the final beast's razor sharp teeth closed down on his arm.  Pain soared through his body as the layers of cloth did little to prevent the bite.  Half his arm was gone, consumed by the black mass behind the teeth.  He tried his best to bash its face in with his other hand but it was difficult to tell if he was even hitting it or merely passing his hand through a shadow.  He dared not pull away lest he leave his arm still in the creature's jaw.

Gerald's vision blurred and he yelled in pain.  He could swear he felt the teeth grinding against his bone.  His entire arm throbbed in tune with vibrations of creature's head as he bashed it.  The red fang showed no sign of feeling his attacks, ever silent.  It simply maintained its bite ever tighter. It seemed to hold him forever until the sound of the girl grunting snapped him back to reality.  She plunged her knife deep into the creature's neck.

The red eyes and face that held him suddenly vanished, as if the projector had been shut off.  The black mass slumped to the ground into a shaggy mess.  Gerald's eyes found his bloodied arm.  His brown cloak was drenched in red.  It had seemed like the pain had disappeared with the creature but the fire was back now and it spread up his arm like a snake.  His muscles contracted and he grunted in pain again.   He collapsed to the floor next to his assailant.  As his vision blurred to nothingness his last sight was the girl looking down at him.  She was saying something but Gerald paid it little mind. He may have been done for tonight but the searing pain let him know that this night was not his last in this nightmare.

It all adds up:    
Hillary Clinton used the money she's stolen from the Clinton global initiative and Whitewater, as well as the loose change Seth Rich, Vince Foster, Ron Brown, and Paul Tulley had on them when she personally murdered them, and combined that Clinton Cash with all the power Bill snuck out of the White House when he was president. That, along with souls extracted when she created her nine wrinkle-free pantsuit horcruxes with the assistance of Bill Gates and... let's throw George Soros in there too,  we both know he's going to come up sooner or later...oh! Almost forgot Kathleen Willey's cat! She stole the cat and used it somehow too. Probably ground it up in a chipper shredder... I just did a google search and Hillary has never specifically denied putting a cat in a chipper shredder, so that's pretty much proven beyond a shadow of a doubt.

Where was I? 

I don't think I need to provide any more proof. The truth is obvious: Hillary Clinton is an evil magic robot. She's more machine than woman.  She runs on human souls and political correctness and she also has a wind farm in upstate new york in case of emergency. She operates with an iron fist and kills all who stand against her and is also brittle and brain damaged and extremely weak,  but evil and power hungry and extremely ruthless and tirelessly vicious but lacking stamina at the same time. I know that all seems a bit contradictory, but you gotta hold both images in your head at once, and never let the two sides of the concept see each other or they'll collapse. You can do it, I believe in you.

I'm sure you know where I'm going with this, I probably don't need to spell it out, but just in case it's not already 100% obvious: Hillary Rodham Clinton can use an SJW Laser Beam to control minds.

I'll admit the lack of logistics in GoT bothers me. I have no idea what the Dothraki are meant to eat.

([‚ô´](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWir8bPu7kI))

---

Alone, any one member of the Youth Gone Wild would have struggled to match Master Bison. A legendary fighter with more experience than all three put together, enough strength and speed to be a deadly threat, the risk of teleporting making distance a negligible disadvantage, and the Psycho Power to elevate his skills to the next level. Alone, few could stand before him.

But Yellow was not alone.

Pika perched on her shoulder, Yellow commanded Gravvy, Ratty, and Omny to attack Bison while Danny swung from a different angle. Bison was crafty, dangerous, and utterly vicious, but outnumbered and outgunned as he was, he could only do so much. The two allies matched each other‚Äôs blows perfectly- Danny shot for the side, keeping Bison from weaving out of a Hydro Pump and forcing him to teleport. When he vanished, both fighters would look to each other, watching their backs and preparing for a sneak attack to negate Bison‚Äôs element of surprise. Were Bison to strike at Yellow‚Äôs unprotected back, Pika was ready to unleash his lightning. Were he to go for Danny instead, the ghost could outmaneuver him, turn invisible, turn his body into an amorphous blob, or otherwise weasel out of the attack.

Suffice to say that Bison was thoroughly outplayed. Despite this, he refused to back down.

‚ÄúInsolent pups!‚Äù Bison swore, throwing a blast of Psycho Power at Yellow as a feint to dash towards Danny, his feet skidding across the ground to trip the boy up. Danny tripped, as expected, but his body levitated without falling, and he twisted into a kick aimed at Bison‚Äôs temple. ‚ÄúYou believe you‚Äôve won!‚Äù His right hand crossed over his chest to latch onto Danny‚Äôs shin, blocking the kick, and he slammed Danny down to the ground hard enough to send dust flying into the air. Danny tried to phase, but the glowing Psycho Power in Bison‚Äôs hands held him still as Bison threw blow after blow into Danny‚Äôs chest and head.

He didn‚Äôt get very far, however, before he heard Yellow‚Äôs shrill cry for a ‚Äúmega punch‚Äù pierce the air. Twisting around, Bison saw Gravvy falling from the sky with a fist glowing like a star. He barely had time to bring a leg up to block the punch with a Psycho Power-infused kick that sent Gravvy flying, but in his desperation hadn‚Äôt been able to build up enough power to actually harm the Pokemon. 

Snarling, Bison threw Danny aside and moved for Yellow. ‚ÄúThat does it! I‚Äôll end you with a single blow!‚Äù Power built in his hands like Gon‚Äôs Jajanken on a much greater scale, and a sensation of dread gripped Yellow‚Äôs stomach like a vice, like looking her own death in the eyes. Furrowing her brow, Yellow stared down Bison, tugging her straw hat tighter on her head as she issued her commands.

‚ÄúGravvy!‚Äù Almost immediately, the Pokemon darted to her aid. She pressed the flat palm of her hand against Gravvy‚Äôs rocky shell and began to heal his wounds, all while watching Bison prepare his technique. Fortunately neither Kitty nor Dody had been seriously hurt, but she couldn‚Äôt keep healing this much, let alone do what she was about to do more than a few times. ‚ÄúReady Gravvy?‚Äù she said as the Golem chirped its agreement. For a moment there was nothing, and then Yellow felt it, a bond stronger than steel forged with her Pokemon. With an effort of will Yellow fed power into Gravvy, boosting his strength enough for one action.

Bison struck, pushing forward with his feet as he begun to spin, the Psycho Power gathered in his hands covering his body like the corona of a meteor. The raw force of the attack tore the ground apart as he closed the distance to Yellow. Anything less than what she was about to do would mean her death.

‚Äú*PSYCHO CRUSHER!*‚Äù Bison yelled.

‚Äú**GIGA PUNCH!**‚Äù Yellow screamed.

The two collided in an explosion of raw force, the shockwave of which was powerful enough to knock Yellow from her feet. Pika found himself knocked from her shoulder, flung across the street, and bounced off of a wall, but was otherwise unhurt. The real damage, however, was at the epicenter of the clash, where Gravvy‚Äôs amped Mega Punch had collided with Bison‚Äôs Psycho Crusher with enough power to create a small crater in the street around the two fighters. As the dust settled, Yellow recovered in time to see what had become of the two.

Gravvy remained standing, barely- by healing him, Yellow had made sure his Sturdy type came in handy, protecting him from being taken out in a single blow. Bison, however, hadn‚Äôt fared so well. While he wasn‚Äôt weakened after using his Psycho Crusher, he had been vulnerable, and momentarily blind to an outside attacker, like the recovering Danny. Bison lay immobile beneath a sheet of solid ice, and Danny‚Äôs glowing blue eyes explained how he had found himself in such a position. Given a moment to rest, Yellow gathered up her Pokemon and walked over to stand beside Danny.

Silence hung in the air for some time, punctuated by the sounds of battle further down the street as Gon struggled against Shooter, and for a moment both fighters wrestled with the same question.

‚ÄúWe should do it,‚Äù Danny said with hesitation that quickly faded from his voice. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs weakened right now, we can do it.‚Äù

Yellow‚Äôs eyes widened in shock. ‚ÄúYou mean-‚Äù

‚ÄúEnd this, yeah.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou mean kill him.‚Äù

Danny grimaced at the word, as if tasting it had made his tongue curl up. ‚ÄúI- ...Yeah.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not going to kill him, Danny.‚Äù

The ice crackled and popped, and beneath it, Bison was stirring. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt have a choice,‚Äù Danny said, desperation growing in his voice.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre wrong,‚Äù Yellow countered, turning to face Danny directly. ‚ÄúWe *do* have a choice. There‚Äôs always a choice.‚Äù

‚ÄúLook, if he gets out, he‚Äôll only be angrier. I don‚Äôt want to do it any more than you do, but I don‚Äôt think we can rope this guy up for the cops.‚Äù He started to say something, but stopped. Yellow still noticed.

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhen you ran out‚Ä¶ you only saw the first body. You didn‚Äôt see what they did to the others.‚Äù Danny‚Äôs eyes had grown dark, distant with memories he didn‚Äôt want to relive. ‚ÄúThese people are cruel, Yellow. More brutal than any I've ever seen. If we don‚Äôt take this chance and they beat us‚Ä¶‚Äù His hand glowed with an eerie green light. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt let that happen to you. To Gon. To anyone else.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt do this,‚Äù Yellow pleaded, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôd be no better than them.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre wrong,‚Äù Danny retorted, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre doing this so they can‚Äôt hurt anyone else. Don‚Äôt you remember what the soldier said to you? Because I do.‚Äù His throat tightened, but he managed to force the words out. ‚ÄúIn our world, bad things happen to good people. Sometimes heroes fight heroes, and sometimes the only way to solve a problem without hurting someone... is to hurt someone else. It's an awful truth, and it feels like the world is out to get you, but when you're faced with an impossible decision that needs to be made, and you have no idea where either road leads, know that your team will always have your back.‚Äù He looked down at Bison, whose body had begun to glow with Psycho Power, and then back to Yellow. ‚ÄúI need you to have my back.‚Äù

Yellow‚Äôs eyes had begun to water, and she rubbed at them with her sleeve so hard that her face had begun to grow red. ‚ÄúI‚Ä¶‚Äù she began, practically sputtering the word. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt. I‚Äôm sorry, Danny, but I can‚Äôt go down that road. I‚Äôll have your back for anything else you ask of me, but not this. If you want to do it, that‚Äôs your choice to make, but‚Ä¶‚Äù She looked away, failing to fight back her tears any longer. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt see this through.‚Äù She turned away and began to walk, leaving Danny alone with Bison in his frozen tomb. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, Danny. Some choices I‚Äôm just not ready to make.‚Äù

Yellow left to find Gon.

Danny finished the job.

It was over. Greed was somewhere in the nearby bay, Shooter was down for the count, and the other two had surely handled Bison by now. Gon stood over Shooter‚Äôs unconscious form, his chest heaving with effort as his knuckles twitched with exhaustion and adrenaline. He knew he had to get back to his friends, to tell them the good news, but he took a moment to let himself calm down first, to bask in the afterglow of victory just a moment longer.

*You have potential, whelp. Like an unrefined diamond.*

"d4b5bmu","The cool rain hitting my hair and streaming down my face is a welcome feeling from the blistering heat that the sun sends against us. My two partners feels much the same way, as we complete the third night of our week-long watch. Up to now the sky has been wide open, making our only respite from the deadly sun the short, humid nights.

I was new at the Wall- that long line of steel and concrete and timber that stood between the fertile grounds of Haven and the ashen lands beyond. I had just turned sixteen, the age our society deemed us adults. When I had left the school for the last time, they handed me a rifle and sent me with two experienced soldiers to watch a certain troublesome region. My job was to keep out the radiated or Eaters that plagued the Outlands.

My dad was so proud of me when I stood for the picture in my uniform. He gave me the same hunting knife and hatchet that he had carried as a soldier on his tours. My mom wept for me and gave me a scarf and hat she had made just for me.

With my brother's jacket and boots, I rode in the wagon, past lush fields of barley and wheat, past glimmering pools of blue coolness and forests of thick greenery. As we came closer the Wall, the trees grew thinner and the fields grew black. The water dried up and soon there was only scorched earth and blackened sky.

My Sergeant was an elderly man, a career soldier that was satisfied with the meager compensation given all in the Guard. His clothing was ragged, for he had none left to send him more or patch his. My comrade was a young lady my age. She'd a lot of freckles and really pretty eyes that would always light up when I grinned at her.

We would watch the Wall every other week, departing from our barracks in the early hours of the morning and arriving at the tower in the later afternoon. We'd sign to the neighboring towers with mirrors that we'd arrived and they'd send us back the same.

The first time I ever killed someone was when a shadow came at us the third night of that shift. I was the only one awake. 

I surveyed the dark landscape, and my accustomed eyes found a silhouette moving across the landscape, charging at our fortifications with some sort of weapon. I leveled the rifle and pulled back the bolt to chamber a round. 

Then I shot. It was as easily as my instructors had made it seem. I hadn't actually shot before. We only had one ammo factory, after all.

The silhouette dropped and at the crack of my gunshot, my Sergeant was immediately at my side. 

""How many, boy?"" He demanded as my comrade joined us. 

""Just one, sir."" I responded. 

The Sergeant turned on the beacon that was mounted on the tall pole over our tower. One flash. One enemy. The other towers responded with a single flash. It was carried on down the land, to regions I'd never seen.

I glanced into the chipped binoculars at the fallen form. They did not stir.

""I'll take over now, boy."" Said my Sergeant and I gladly took the rest. My comrade was excited to hear my story and she thought I was the bravest man she'd ever met.

At first light, another form charged at us. My rifle downed this target as well and my comrade hugged me with great pride. 

My Sergeant patted me on the shoulder. ""Good man."" Said he.

I stared through my binoculars at the two down targets and my heart plummeted deep into my stomach as I saw the two dead children splayed on the ground far off. The buzzards had already gathered, ignoring the tiny barbed wire spears laying beside the corpses.

""They're just kids."" I swore and my comrade squeaked in terror.

The Sergeant stared at me with cold eyes and shook his head. ""They send them at us so small- vicious, but young""

I stared at him with horror and I knew he could see it. 

""There's not many trees out here, with the water scarcity."" He continued, and reading my puzzled face clarified, ""Child-sized coffins need less lumber.""

I heaved and threw up all over the floor of the tower as my comrade rubbed my back. The Sergeant only stared at the horizon, watching for more invaders.

Like, I've always been a big fan of monsters having character in media. Aragog from Harry Potter was a big influence back as a child, since I really liked that they exerted a kind of ""powerful and fear-inducing aura"" but all the while still being a living and thinking sentient being, which always felt overlooked. Like, every time you play an RPG you kill all these big scary monsters, and you never really consider any of them to have actual conscious thoughts like we do, that they're thinking and emotional characters in their own way. I really felt attracted to characters like this in games, and Broodmother really struck a chord with me quickly after I first got into the Dota scene.

To be honest though, I didn't really get all that emotionally interested until I read this[ fancomic \(warning: fairly long and spidery\)](http://xofks12.deviantart.com/art/Broodmother-s-Time-539158528) about a year ago.

Maybe, but the country in general is moving more towards the left all the time, at least when it comes to issues like civil rights. Yeah there's still lots of opposition and it's loud and vicious, but a President who does no more than stay center with the American public will at least not *hurt* civil rights. 

OTOH, I do think that's an unfair characterization of her social policies, as she's moved fairly significantly to the left on a lot of issues (even before she started her campaign). My view is that when it comes to social politics she's going to essentially be Obama v 2.0.

Economically she's probably going to appeal more to the big business side of things, though that's not necessarily a given based on her campaign stances. I'd probably peg her as more conservative with her economic ideology than Obama.

Foreign affairs I think she's likely to be more interventionist than Obama ever dreamt of being. I don't necessarily have an issue with that (depending on the intervention and the circumstances), but I can see why other lefties would. 

Clinton has also spent years in politics and knows how to get things done. She's a pragmatic, like Obama is. That means she's likely to piss off the ideologues when bills don't get passed to their high standards. But it will also hopefully mean that more shit will get done--especially if downstream races start being affected by Trump running.

The idea of the reflective equilibrium and the principles from the OP are thought provoking, and challenge our idea of equality and human nature. He also had a really rough childhood, I've heard. 

And while luck egalitarianism doesn't fit his concept of justice, I do think it can be useful in arguing against libertarian positions. Side note, its also the sort of idea to split those most honest with themselves about the nature of what fortunes they've had, and those who just wont admit it.

There was this Canadian woman back in 2011 with a really eerie Facebook profile - huge text posts followed by incessant strings of comments left by herself mere minutes apart. Scans of damaged photographs. Vicious but intelligent and often well-spoken rants. There seemed to be a theme - espionage, high society, surveillance, the ruling elite. I was engrossed by it more than I should have - there did seem to be a method behind all the madness and it was fascinating.

"d35tsse","""Thomas, can you hear me?"" 

""Thomas can you feel it?""

Those were the last words Thomas heard. For a brief moment, he felt or heard nothing, like a submerged body in a motionless pool. Conscious of himself and his existence amidst the absence of everything else. 


""So that's how it feels.""


He moved a finger, then the hand, it all seemed alright. This place wasn't supposed to be so natural, he thought, trying to reach any sort of ground with his feet, with no success. 


It was time to open his eyes. 


He was surrounded by existence. Endless possibilities. Wars never waged, colors never seen, races and life forms mankind was still to encounter. Everything happening at once. A kid tripping on a stone then dying but also managing to fall on his hands. Life and death always exist. All possibilities are real. It all coexists at once. 


He saw the day when the signal came back from the probe, showing the universe wasn't expanding but in constant creation. The Beyond Project, decrypting the information and gathering data from the Great Attractor feedback, which ultimately revealed itself both the answer for never asked questions but also a whole new set of inquires for humanity. 


The whole Universe was made of code. Locked, encrypted, unhackable, untraceable code. 


For decades mankind attempted to break through the algorithm, failing countless times. A few bits of code were decrypted as fast as a snail crossing over the desert. Surprisingly, those tiny pieces allowed humanity to develop technologies once considered witchcraft. 


Was not until the last century, 157 years after the discovery that a pack of data hit the project's station in Mars. Once it wasn't deeply encrypted, the project's scientists took only 15 months to break through. It was a coordinate, a map pointing to a still unformed dark area of the Universe invisible to mankind's tech. Probably another dimension. Most likely the final answer to everything. 


From where Thomas could evaluate, this place held more questions than answers so far. 


He held the vomit, lured by the idea that he had something to put out, but he made the effort nevertheless. 


""Put it together, Thomas. This is not a computer. This is a display. I want the terminal.""


He was sitting in a desk. A monitor and a keyboard staring back at him. Existence and time rolling like a screensaver on the display. He pressed ESC, nothing happened. ENTER. Nothing. He typed GOD. The screen remained the same. 


""Give me the commands.""


Characters began to flow down the monitor so fast he couldn't even read them. He should have known The Universe's commands would be near infinite to say the least. He ordered the terminal to stop and it immediately did. 


""I need an interface. A simple user friendly system.""


She was made of dream itself. Her golden skin, deep dark green eyes, the hair flowing up in a silver wave crushing in thin air. He didn't even notice he was on his knees. 


""Are you God?""

""For your race, maybe.""

""Who are you?""

""I am the interface.""

""If you're the interface, who's on the other side?""

""You wouldn't understand the answer.""

""Why not?""

""The current version doesn't support the needed language requirements.""

""Your current version?"" 

""No. The current version of what your race calls Universe.""

""Is... Is there an available update pack for the Universe?""

""Yes. It has been available for 10.000 human years.""

""Why wasn't it installed?""

""The last user chose not to.""

""Why not?""

""Only such user could answer your question.""

""Can I install it?""

""You can. If you couldn't you wouldn't be here.""

""What will change?""

""This update is mostly a language pack. All lifeforms would be able to utterly 
understand each other and the Universe itself .""

""Can you install it in me before I make my decision?""

""Yes. But if you choose not to install the update, it will be deleted from your memory.""

""Ok. Proceed and install it in me.""

Thomas fell to an nonexistent ground. Although it felt real. 
He saw it all: the consciousness, the split, the metastasis of an once unique mind, shattering itself through multi layered fabrics of existence. The creation of the void, the explosion happening over and over in an vicious but beautiful cycle.  He suddenly grasped the hidden language before his eyes, in a millisecond he heard a quasar's tale of light and matter, he listened closely to Andromeda's choir, cried when Orion told him about it's lost half, how it's core would never be hot enough to hide the pain. Each and all races, cultures and empires throughout the Universe. He knew them all.

""If every single life form acquired such knowledge, chaos would unfold.""

""That's what the last user said.""

""I know. I remember it all now. Interface, this time delete the update from the server and schedule a system restart for 10000 years from now unless I find you again. Move to another layer and stand by.""

""Are you sure?""

""Yes.""

""Proceeding.""

"d34dxeh","Hey OP great question. scott adams does a much better analysis than anyone right or left has done on what Trump is doing and why he's doing it.

Anyone that seems to be on the money on it nowadays has probably plagiarised from scott.

**""Will a More ""Presidential‚Äù Trump Still be Persuasive?**

*We expect Trump to move to the middle and act more ‚Äúpresidential‚Äù now that he has the Republican nomination in hand. You might wonder if that will make him less persuasive, given that the wild stuff he has done so far has worked well. Why change?*

*My best guess is that the public is primed for Trump to act presidential because it fits the ‚Äúbad boy turns good‚Äù movie we all have in our heads. Everyone likes Han Solo, the tough talker with the heart of gold. Trump is making that movie-like transition now, but don‚Äôt expect him to go easy on Clinton. The Clinton attacks will be vicious, but Trump‚Äôs overall vibe will still trend (spottily) toward presidential. That will give both sides plenty to talk about.*

*Trump is acting presidential! Wait, what did he just say? No, he‚Äôs presidential again. Hold on, what did he just say???*

*It serves Trump well to have it both ways at the same time. So he‚Äôll keep you guessing until Clinton is toast. Then he‚Äôll go full-presidential. (Well, mostly.)""*

An antisemites song

Im tired of being a gangster and bandit,
Ill join anti-Semites - its cool, safe and splendid!
They have on their side no laws and no orders,
But peoples support of these folks has no borders.

I made up my mind - and someone will be battered,
But who are these Semites - I must know better.
Perhaps, they are people quite decent and fair,
To touch those people, of course, I dont dare.

But one of my buddies, a boozer and cripple,
Explained that these Semites are Jews - its so simple!
Its fortune, its luck, so rare and dear,
I worry no more, since Ive nothing to fear!

On my reputation there was no swine stain -
I always respected this guy Albert Einstein,
Excuse me for being too tough and too vicious,
But Lincolns first name sounds very suspicious

Among them there are victims of hitlerism,
Among them this crank who made up communism,
You see those Jews everywhere around,
Including my fave, Charlie Chaplin, the clown.

But that old boozer - he told me, inspired,
That Jews suck our Christian blood like vampires,
And when we were drinking one man let me know
That they crucified Jesus Christ long ago.

They tortured to death in the zoo poor camels
These Jews feed on blood like on milk do the mammals,
I know these Jews stole bread from the nation
To cause epidemics and widespread starvation.

They grab all the best, and they win all the tosses;Theyve built classy villas and live like big bosses...
Im ready for beating, for looting, for crushing,
Ill kick those kikes and Ill save dear Russia.

Una canzone antisemita

Perch√© dovrei stare con gangster o i banditi, 
seguo la moda, mi unisco agli antisemiti!

ma solo il sostegno di milioni di persone.

certamente un semita, ma solo dopo aver cenato. 
Forse, il semita, √® una persona buona e giusta, 
ma a toccarla, ovviamente, solo con la frusta.

tra di loro il grande Charlie Chaplin, il comunista, 
il mio amico Rabinovich e le vittime del nazifascismo, 
e perfino il fondatore del marxismo...

che bevono il sangue dei cristiani lattanti; 
una volta, ancora lui, appoggiato a un'infisso
mi dice: tanto tempo fa Cristo hanno crocifisso. 

Torturano a morte elefanti e tapiri
si nutrono di sangue come fanno i vampiri, 
hanno rubato, come al solito, alla nazione, 
tutto il grano dell'anno scorso per causare un'infezione.

That would be a juristical nightmare. Ruling some proves out (like the mentioned natural inconsistencies and false confessions) and allowing others would make a huge mess.

The Facebook message scenario you mentioned is already one of those cases. Victims of long term abuse often try to reconnect with their abusers due to emotional dependency.

Yet I get what you say and I don't think there is no room for reform in that matter, there always is.

"d2lfauy","For fuck's sake. If you're going to argue with me, at least have some reading comprehension.

I didn't *say* that his influence went away after the Mani Mani statue was destroyed. That was only a partial catalyst and breaking it only broke his control over a handful of people who had been in close physical proximity to it (and susceptible to mind control). Neither of us were saying that Giygas' influence resided 100% in the Mani Mani statue, anyway? Like, what on earth? That doesn't make any sense.

What I *said* is that his influence completely disappeared when he died at the end of EB. And because time travel was required to reach him, we can then infer that since his influence completely disappeared from all of the affected people, animals and objects in EB's time period, his influence disappeared from timespace completely and therefore couldn't have remained with Porky either. I literally already said this. Christ, don't make me repeat myself.

Anyway. You're taking Porky's defiance of Giygas too literally--Giygas' ""evil"" was a tangible influence, but what sets Porky apart is that his is a very different sort of evil.

By the time of EB, Giygas is an entirely insane entity that has no control over what he does; his PSI is simply so absurdly powerful that it tore his body apart and spread across spacetime. What we call his ""influence"" is more like the background radiation of his PSI affecting things mentally and physically to behave in accordance with his insanity. Giygas is an unconscious, tortured existence, crying out in pain during the final battle; in EB he's more of a snarl of negative emotions than an actual thinking being. Giygas in EB is hate, fear, rage, guilt, sadness, jealousy; he's a perfect storm of feelings which culminate in what we call ""evil"". There's a reason Porky calls him an ""almighty idiot""; Giygas has an absolutely ridiculous amount of raw power, but he's so far gone that Porky was able to easily pull the strings in his own favor.

In contrast, Porky's brand of evil is very much his own. His is a conscious evil. Those who are influenced by Giygas are often rambling, easily enraged, blindly hateful and violent, as befits the type of evil he is the embodiment of. Porky, on the other hand, is calculating, conniving and entirely self-serving. He retains his childish mindset well past the point that he ought to have, but he isn't insane in the same way that Giygas and his ilk were. Porky as the ""wielder of evil"" is playful, wickedly humorous and blatantly disregards the sanctity of any life other than his own.

Giygas was never like this. Even before EB: Back in his M1 incarnation, he only hated humans, specifically, for what happened to him as a result of his upbringing with George and Maria. Giygas did not intentionally go out of his way to hurt any of Earth's creatures outside of humans for fun or any other reason. He was humorless, straightforward and vicious, but he also had a fair side: he did make an offer to Ninten to spare him (and only him) as they were technically family. Porky doesn't resemble Giygas at all, not in his general demeanor, not in the way he commits evil. Giygas' influence isn't present in him. If it *was,* he'd behave differently.

About the spider mech: We don't actually know where Porky got said mech from in the first place; for all we know he could have *built* it. He's certainly not portrayed as an unintelligent character. On the mind control devices and other such technologies, he also had thousands of years for that. Plenty of time to spend educating himself on such things by the time M3 rolled around.

Alternatively, we also see that although he progressively became more and more restricted in his ability to time travel, Porky was clearly able to kidnap individuals from other time periods and bring them to him.

Apparently it's not wrong to show the English being horrible and vicious, but the Scots aren't supposed to want to fight back.

"d1tye10","Joffery is a douche. But is he evil? I wouldn't say evil.  He is jealous and vicious and power hungry.  If that makes someone evil in your book, than that's fine.  But to me Joffery is not evil. He's just a spoiled brat who was raised poorly and was given too much power too young.  If I was raised as a king, I would be like Jofffery too.  

Roose- Roose is again power hungry and vicious, but if you are calling him evil you gotta call everyone evil,  Sure he did weaken other houses only to gain power for himself.  But is that evil? Is that Smart? Men were going to die anyway, who cares if they were from House Cerwyn or house Bolton? All he really wants is to be where the Starks are, and I'm sure somewhere along the lines the Starks did the same thing, and nobody is calling the Starks evil. So, why call Roose evil? 

Ramsay is a prick. He mentally tortures people to do his will.  And I guess he would fall pretty well close to evil in my book.  However, he mentally  screwed with what, a dozen people? How many people has Robb Stark killed in war? Or how many has Dany killed in her conquests? Ramsay again just wants power, and comparability he is screwing with a much lesser number of people than most of the other characters.  If you want to call him evil, fine, call him evil.  But isn't it really the system that makes him evil? 

Euron- Euron is indeed a bastard. However, he is also a tortured soul. He says that every night someone sends him agonizing dreams and that he is doing what he does to follow his master. Just like Theon, somebody is mentally controlling Euron in to doing bad things.  Is he responsible for the bad things he does? I don't know. But, characters are much more complicated than they appear to be. 

I think that's one of the biggest points of this book.  Is that there is no good, there is no evil. Everyone just is themselves. Sometimes they do nice things, some times they do bad things. There is never an Emperor Palpatine character in ASOIAF or real life we all are complex people who have done good and bad.  

You mentioned Hitler.  Hitler was an artist and a vegetarian because he thought eating meat was cruel.

I'm saying how the soviet leadership tackled the issue of de-stalinisation. The wellfare of the whole state and avoiding a civil war was priority while demolishing beliefs of the past. The ideology needed to be demolished first before concrete measures were to be taken to fix the wrongs of the past.

People had to stay in Siberia for couple of years longer but same as with POW's after Stalins death a lot more of resources were thrown to change the camp system before the final release order was given. Likewise those people were kept in the region because you couldn't simply dump hundreds of thousands of people onto a soviet republic without preparing things for their eventual return. 

Hitlers rule was one of subjegation and slave labor of those he deemed racially inferior based on nothing but their ethnic background. You could be a Russian, an Estonian, a Jew, an Ukranian and be the soviet elite taking direct orders from the Georgian Bicycle mustache in Kremlin or be the same and fated to serve the union from within the barbed wired camps for 10 years.

"d1ao7yo","An incomplete list of viable rather than safe:
Mechs that fight from longer range. Mechs that have the hardpoints to peek and win trades while limiting damage or the hitboxes to spread it well. Mechs that are fast enough to get in and out of the fight or reposition quickly. Mechs that have the mobility to get to especially high ground.

The Grasshoppers, Quickdraws, ENF-4R, and BJ-3 are good examples.To some extent, the Cicadas, too.

Black Knights got massive structure buffs and that makes XLs a bit more viable. Especially with the firepower an XL allows it to take. 

The BJ-1X has the firepower to deal enough damage at close range to win fights before the XL becomes a liability. Likewise GRF-3Ms and 2Ns, though SRMs can be a liability in PUG play.

Dual Gauss and UAC5 Jagermechs are a bit underrated. They have good structure quirks to allow more tanking and decent weapon quirks as well.

"d17t18b","I also think this is a truly notable film, worthy of inclusion. It is exceptionally challenging and vicious, but it creates the circumstances within the form of cinema itself to truly explore and deliver social meaning.

It's a truly valuable *reason* to explore film form and editing.

Personally speaking, *Irreversible* is one of, maybe 5 or 10 films that I have had such a radical response to that I felt immediately ""changed"" after seeing it. It is a hugely impactful and disturbing film. I tend to think of those few experiences as being exceptionally important, and worth finding.

The Archdemon is a giant, blight corrupted dragon that controls the darkspawn, similar to a hive mind, but not fully.

The darkspawn are savage and vicious, but not necessarily tactical. As someone in DAi put it, darkspawn don't think, they flow. As long as their numbers aren't dying too fast, they'll just continue to tear through the opponent.

Now, as far as magic is concerned, the darkspawn have access to ""DA magic"" like anyone else, it's just a matter of learning it. Generally, Darkspawn have hex/black magic/etc types of spells along with some offensive spells, so they could use these but I have no idea how it'd affect the Sauron's army, nor how their magic would affect the darkspawn.

As far as match ups go, the cave trolls could probably beat the ogres. If I recall, ogres are about twice as big as a human in height whereas cave trolls tower over humans, so the height could go either away, but I feel the trolls would win that. The hurlocks and genlocks, if we go by more recent chapters of DA, can be both very tanky and very brutal and may overpower the orc soldiers. I don't know what the elephants could do, but unless the Nazgul can keep the Archdemon off of them, the AD will burn them happily. Air support on Sauron's side will only really need to focus on the AD. The bulk of the darkspawn army is ground troops.

Sauron himself is very powerful if I recall. He may be able to turn the tide if he can rally his troops enough. The fear of facing the darkspawn may scare the orcs more than the fight itself.

"d0incd4","Most of my professional career has been SMB - not a lot of large companies based in my area, so that's just the nature of working out there. In my experience, there are two kinds of SMBs:

1. Those that are professional to a fault.
2. Those that are lax to a fault.

I've worked for both, and let me tell you something, they get away with behavior in *either* direction that wouldn't fly at larger companies. Larger companies have HR departments that file paperwork when someone says something they shouldn't - if you say the wrong thing in front of the wrong person at an SMB, you learn the hard way what ""right to work"" means. On the other hand, if you work for a company that's basically a frat house, you learn the hard way that, if given enough rope, people will happily hang themselves with the rafters, especially when alcohol starts flowing during official work functions. 

Given a choice, I'll take ""professional to a fault"". Sure, the rules are capricious and vicious, but they're *predictably* capricious and vicious. Everybody knows who they can say stuff around and who they can't.

"d00i591","As far as personally just 'fun'.. I really loved beastlord in EQ - hybrids are just plain awesome, and I LOVE a pet class that doesn't have just some give-no-shits disposable pet they don't care about thematically, while also getting to fight alongside said pet in melee rather than twing some dumb bow or poot magic.

The feel of fighting side by side, claw weapons and bites and feral combat, with a vicious but faithful-for-life companion was super fun.

That said, I think Asheron's Call 2 had the most uniquely interesting class - as a ""hive keeper"" you literally wielded a little wasp nest on a sling, kinda like a hoopak or a flail, and would swing it around and fling wasps at your enemies as a ranged weapon.. Skills included summoning wasps as temporary pets, self-heals, aggro-dumps, infections that spawned more temporary wasps, and so forth. Sure as hell never seen a wasp-based pet micromanagement class.

DAoC had some super duper unique classes, too.. I'll definitely hand it to 'em!

Vanguard also had some great ones.. I'm not big on healing, but I rather loved playing Disciple, it was a downright _fun_ healer.

They think in terms of inches, and whether it's huge. Anything less than huge isn't hung - it's the object of ridicule if a guy claims he's hung, but is just a little bit bigger than average.

~~~~~

The chamber was silent save for the heavy breathing.  An eerie stillness entranced the room.  Not even the dust drifting in the faint moonlight by the entrance dared to flurry, instead slowly drifting to the ground in an endless breathless breeze unfelt by anything else in the room.  Deeper inside the ruins no light reached, leaving the figure alone with the statues.  Yet, amongst the emptiness, there was another presence.  Unseen and unheard, but not unfelt.
Sevran shuttered in his prone position.  The moment he arrived at this awful place he could feel the terribleness that lurked within.  Venturing through the Valley of the Tombs, he could feel the ancient eyes that watched him from beyond.  He had never felt such malice before in his life.  The amount of suffering that had once plagued this whole world left an unmistakable mark upon the land.  The creatures had been grotesque and vicious, but even they did not enter the tombs themselves.  A hate that far surpassed their own kept them at bay.  It had been jarring to see the creatures of rage whimper in utter terror at the shadows of these ruins.  Had that very same fear not washed over him, Sevran would not have believed such a feeling was possible.
His mind clouded as the pain came rushing back.  The burning agony beneath his skin let him know he was not dead yet.  He dare not scream out, and let the presence know his weakness, but his body betrayed him.  He sprawled out upon the ritual floor and the chamber echoed with his agony.  The malice was upon him yet again.  Sevran feared he would perish beneath these trials, and that very fear was fed upon by the shadows and amplified his pain.
After what seemed like an eternity his body felt numb to the pain.  Numb, but sore all the same.  He struggled to his feet.  The door before him was now open.  He had passed the trial.  Despite all his training and preparation, he was gripped with fear.  Fear of what await him deeper inside the tomb, fear of what would happen should he fail his task here, but most of all, he was afraid of what he felt inside of him.  That which he had steeled himself against the most, hate.  The hate he had for this place and the presence he was fighting against.  He did his best to push it away.  To let go of it.  But with every step deeper into the tomb, as his body ached and his mind was filled at the horrors he sought to protect the others from.  That hate found its way back inside of him.  It burrowed deeper each time.  
Sevran could not fail.  He knew that.  He knew that no matter what the cost he could not fail as the others had.  Too much was at stake this time.  The Council had made the gravity of the situation very clear.  If the secrets deep within the tombs could not be discovered, then they would have no chance at stopping the prophecy.  The galaxy would crumble beneath the might of the dark army and all light would be erased.  No freedom or happiness could live under their rule. No other could take on this task either.  Everyone had their part to play in this war, and this was Sevran‚Äôs.  Many had tried to enter this ancient valley before and all perished, or worse.  Sevran alone could succeed where they failed.  He knew this, but being the only who could succeed was not a guarantee that he would.  It just meant that there was some small chance.  A chance they told him not to take.
At the end of the hall was another chamber.  This one had no further doors or passage ways.  Instead, the room had a small and simple alter at the far end.  A small light emanated from an object on it but the shadows obscured what it was.  There was no other light source this deep inside the grand tomb.  Surely this was what Sevran sought.  Inside the artifact would be the ancient secrets of the empire.  With it Sevran could take control of the dark army and banish it.  The Council said that the tomb could not be found and if it was, the trials could not be passed and if they were the knowledge could not be contained.  Sevran had found it, and passed all the trials thus far.  Now came the final test.  The last great battle for the fate of the galaxy would not take place between star cruisers and battlestations or between grand armies and fierce combat.  It would be here, on this desolate planet, in an abandoned valley, deep inside a forgotten tomb.  It would be a personal fight.  Not with a great adversary or a clever puzzle but within Sevran himself.
He slowly kneeled down and closed his eyes before the artifact.  He readied himself for the wrath of his enemy.  The ultimate malice that the Council warned was at the very heart of their enemy.  Each trial had been a hundred fold greater than the last.  The suffering and pain was both internal and external.   But no amount of meditation or training could prepare him for what he felt.  The presence simply dissipated away.  The shadow that hung upon him lifted and he was suddenly at peace.  Had he finally succeeded?  
As soon as the thought entered his mind, Sevran knew it was untrue.  He could still feel the hate, it was merely hiding.  He felt the intense rage and was ashamed that he had not seen it before.  He had been so distracted by the presence that he had not looked within at all.  Here, in the complete silence within the artifact chamber the true threat was suddenly clear.  
The path to peace was balance.  To let go of hate one had to understand it.  One needed to see the bigger picture and understand one‚Äôs place within the greater whole.  One needed to be at harmony with themselves in order to achieve harmony on a grander scale.  Sevran suddenly understand the irony of this.  Harmony within oneself was harmony on a grander scale.  He had been a fool all along to separate the two.

He began to probe the hate within him.  To search out its root and to cut it off at the source.  He felt the pain he had endured to reach this point.  The agony of the trials.  The sorrow on the loss of his companions.  The fear his adversaries had invoked.  But the more he probed the more hate he found.  He hated the Dark Army for the pain they caused to him, the Order and the galaxy as a whole.  He hated it for the very nature of the Dark Army, fueled by the suffering of others to make it an invincible cycle of pain.  He hated those who called the army forth in their desperation to destroy their enemies.  He hated the ideological differences that started this war.  He hated those who lived blissfully unaware of this suffering, or worse those who benefited from it.  
The chamber was silent save for Sevran‚Äôs heavy breathing.  An eerie stillness entranced the room.  Not even the dust drifting in the faint light of the artifact dared to flurry, instead slowly drifting to the ground in an endless breathless breeze unfelt by anything else in the room.  Deep inside the ruins, the light could not pierce through, leaving Sevran alone with the altar.  Yet, amongst the emptiness, there was another presence.  Unseen and unheard, but Sevran could feel the hate in his heart.

‚ÄúPay attention, my apprentice.‚Äù  Master Tonk said.  ‚ÄúFor the story of Darth Sevran is the ultimate tale of caution against greed and lust for power.  If you seek power, it will consume you.  It is the path to the dark side.  Darth Sevran‚Äôs lust for power is what led him to bring forth the Dark Army and lead the Sith to victory against the Jedi order 100 years ago.  Never before have the forces of darkness held the galaxy in such a way as they do now.  So remember, as we seek the strength to defeat our enemies and restore peace to the galaxy, we cannot let ourselves seek strength to simply be powerful like Darth Sevran did.

"cyob5ux","The Lion King was created when Tribesman Michael Eisner, Disney CEO, implemented his strategy of churning out movies with non-White themes. So it is an African movie with African ""singing"" in the background, James Earl Jones doing the king‚Äôs voice, the female love interest being voiced by a shegress, and the wise old baboon having many Black tribal characteristics. But the story is amazingly pertinent:
The lions rule the savannah because they are the best rulers and make no excuses for that; it‚Äôs the ""circle of life"". (An expression misunderstood by leftoids ever since.) The dirty hyenas are kept outside the borders. The lion Scar is black-maned, cunning and vicious, but still accepted by the lions as one of them. Though they don‚Äôt trust him, and tell jokes about him and they foolishly let him stay.
Scar backstabs the king, and forces the prince Simba to inaction by filling him with false guilt. He then floods the savannah with immigrating hyenas, using them as his power base when he takes control. He holds a speech about living together for a glorious future, contrasting with the image of the evil hyenas approaching. Soon the lions are starving under Scar‚Äôs misrule. Scar and the hyenas become fed up with each other, and Scar has in fact despised them the whole time.
Simba, filled with guilt, adopts an irresponsible, selfish ideology called ""hakuna matata"". (Unsurprisingly treated as something positive by leftoids ever since.) He learns this ideology from weaker animals who explicitly set out to snare his mind in order to use him, something they never tell him. They turn him away from his natural hunting instinct. When Simba speaks of his ancestors, the pride and duty his father told him to feel, they laugh in his face until he abandons that line of thinking.
In the end though Simba shakes off the ""hakuna matata"" ideology and goes to take back his ancestral land, as is his duty. Scar‚Äôs reign ends in blood and fire ‚Äì fittingly he is killed by the hyenas as he tries to curry favor with the victorious Simba. Simba did not repeat his father‚Äôs mistake of permitting the black-maned Scar to live among the better lions as one of them.Ôªø

&gt; Deep in the jungle of a remote island in the Pacific lives a new breed of mutant snake. Dr. Andrea Swanson and her research assistant Jake have been studying the species in a top secret military experiment to develop the ultimate anti-toxin. But when tensions rise with the Chinese military, Admiral Bradley Wallace quickly evacuates the island. The only way home is an old, decommissioned submarine on its final voyage to its new home in Taiwan. Wallace decides to put Lt. Commander James O'Neill at the helm, a hardened pro facing forced retirement... and he is less than pleased to be ""babysitting"" his two new guests. But they're not alone. Andrea was ordered to bring some of the experimental snakes back to the mainland - and worse, Jake has smuggled some of the deadlier mutated snakes on board, including a giant diamondback. When a Chinese vessel attacks the sub, the vicious creatures are released from their secure containers and begin to stalk the crew members one by one. Trapped two hundred feet below sea level with no way out, the sub's skeleton crew find themselves attacked... in the galley, torpedo room, shower, and control room. The snakes are hungry and vicious... but nothing can prepare the crew for the terror that awaits them when the diamondback escapes its captivity. Growing in size and ferocity with each meal... the mutated beast is seemingly unstoppable. O'Neill and Andrea become unlikely allies in the fight to keep the deadly snakes at bay as Wallace worries about an international incident as they try to save the sub from the enemy vessels tracing their every move...

"cxukslu","Asmodeus is a very intelligent being, as lawful as he is evil.

I would expect a curse of his to represent his LE alignment and serve hell in some way: cursing somebody with pain or weakness is mean and vicious, but not particularly diabolical and doesn't do much to serve him. Something similar to a *Geas/Quest* spell is appropriate. 

Some options for a punishing curse that makes the PC submissive to Asmodeous:

* Must burn (un)holy incense in Asmodeus's name every day or go blind. The incense is, of course, expensive. Particularly painful for a greedy character.

* Become branded with a modified holy symbol of Asmodeus. The brand is prominent and obvious. Non-worshipers recognize it as the symbol of Asmodeus, worshipers recognize it as a mark of a heretic or defiler. It gives a penalty to CHA skills and makes worshipers who pass a knowledge religion check hostile. If it's covered, it moves to an uncovered part of the body 24 hours later.

* Takes 1 point of CON drain every month they do not make a living sacrifice to Asmodeus.

Or perhaps something more insidious. Perhaps his stolen relic is a cursed item. It has some use, like turning blood poured into it into wine that acts as a potion of *Cure Light Wounds* and *Lesser Restoration*, but every time a non-worshiper drinks from it they're more and more likely to suffer a calamity. A permanent *Rage* + *Touch of Idiocy* perhaps? Cumulative 1% chance, no save? 

Or perhaps if a non-worshiper drinks out of it they age 1 year for every hit point/ability point restored.

"cxtm128","I've watched every interview with the cast and crew of season 2 I could find and I'm telling you as one huge punisher fan to another, relax. Everyone involved has spoken at length about how much respect they have for the character and how there's a possibility of establishing the character long-term in the future of Netflix/Marvel.

The show runners have shown their ability to write morally complex but likeable characters (Stick, Wesley, Fisk, The Russians) and they even made sure to name drop Garth Ennis among their main influences for the character this season. Every detail I can pick out from the set gives me the impression we are getting a comic accurate version of the character.

I think it's likely that Daredevil will win his fair share of hand to hand conflicts as he often does in the comics, but ultimately the two will end up forced to confront an imminent threat. They have a much more complex relationship than I think most of the people on these boards are aware of. Neither enemies nor allies accurately describes them. 

I think Punisher will fill an antagonistic role but in a way that satisfies his fans, (myself included.) The only thing I hope they stray away from is the portrayal of punisher as reckless and indifferent to civilian casualties,but again given that they're drawing from Ennis I think we will get a tactical professional.

"cxjjemg","I feel it's one of those things Araki left ambiguous on purpose. An important dichotomy of Dio's character is shown in Phantom Blood -- evil by nature as Speedwagon claims, or evil by nurture, which we are shown his childhood so that we also take that possibility into consideration. I'd say he's both.

When Dio first gains his power in Phantom Blood, he lets his inner inhibitions loose and does whatever he pleases. But 100 years later, when we finally see Dio explain his motives to Polnareff, it becomes clear that the time he spent in the coffin, as well as the uncertainties that the culture shock of society 100 years later shows, has made Dio re-evaluate his overall goals. Yes, he is still manipulative and vicious, but he puts major emphasis on the goal of all human beings being ""happiness"".

At the time he spoke about happiness and certainty, it was expressed in a way that it seemed he was trying to manipulate Polnareff, but fastforward to Part 6, when Pucci is explaining his motives to Emporio -- He ALSO mentions ""certainty and happiness"" as the driving force behind his plan, which by then had been shown to be DIO's plan as well.

It could be argued that at the end of the day, DIO's true goal may have actually been actual peace through certainty, and since Pucci had been through a similarly tragic past and had similar feelings towards peace, he was probably one of the few people who actually understood DIO's stance on the matter, and I think at some level DIO DID see him as a friend as well as a tool.

"cx95pt2","I think considering the history of pit bulls is important to contexualize these kind of statistics.

Pit bulls were bred for fighting in the Middle Ages. They were often tasked with trying to kill a bear or a bull (a group of dogs would fight the larger animal). They would also fight other dogs, similar to what we would think of now as dog fighting.

Obviously, one of the considerations when breeding animals for fights, in addition to strength, speed, agility, etc, is temperament. This means pit bulls need to be vicious,  fearless, and relentless in a fight. A bear or a bull isn't going to accept a dog's surrender, and no one is ending the fight until the bear is dead or all the dogs are. So it's no good for a pit bull to ever give up, regardless of injuries.

You can see this trait selection in several instances. You can get a pit bull latched on to your arm, and he's not letting go, no matter how much you hit him.

Even sadder is how pit bulls will behave in a fight with another dog. Dogs are bred from wolves, and a fight for wolves is a chance to show dominance. When a wolf loses, he rolls on to his back as a sign of submission and surrender. Dogs do this too. Unfortunately, pit bulls are bred to fight to the death, so they will immediately go for the soft underbelly and disembowel their already-defeated opponent.

That being said, there is more nuance to this issue than that. As I mentioned, pit bulls did not only fight one on one with another dog. They were also part of a team of other dogs, so it was important that pit bulls could distinguish friend from foe. A mindless killing machine that will attack the first animal it sees is pretty useless when it's part of a group fighting a bear.

More importantly, if you are breeding a dog to be a pure, vicious killing machine, **you want to make fucking sure it's not going to bite you**. Pit bulls were bred to be vicious, but they also had to be patient with the right people. If you are trying to train a dog, one that has even the slightest chance of turning on you is sure as fuck not reproducing.

So paradoxically, even though pit bulls were bred to be strong and vicious, they were also bred to be extremely patient. So patient in fact, that for many years, they were used as companions for small children. Google ""pit bull nanny dog"" to see plenty of pictures of dogs patiently playing with small children.

My personal theory is that pit bulls have gained a self-fulfilling reputation as a vicious animal. Now, people who are looking for an intimidating dog buy a pit bull. Unfortunately, people like this know nothing about training or caring for a dog and think that abuse is the way to handle an animal. They end up with scared, maladjusted animals that lash out at anything that comes near them.

You can bet that when people were training fighting dogs several centuries ago, they had a lot more skill and nuance than just beating the shit out of the dogs to make them aggressive.

The breed doesn't make an aggressive dog, abuse does. Unfortunetely, pit bulls are common choices for abusive owners. Combined with their natural strength and agility, you end up with a deadly animal.

That has little to do with the breed though. If pit bulls were all killed tomorrow, a new breed would pop up as a favorite among assholes. Or maybe a variety of breeds. Regardless, you wouldn't see much of a reduction in this fatalities, just a redistribution to other breeds.",1448214615,"so paradoxically, even though pit bulls were bred to be strong and vicious, they were also bred to be extremely patient.","strong and vicious","vicious",NA,FALSE,"strong and vicious","strong",NA,NA,0

Going off the book, only Boromir has done that. And orcs are small, vicious, but decidedly inferior to men/elves/dwarves.

&gt; or a dozen Balrogs (the D√∫nedain anyway)

Absolutely fucking not. A Balrog is so far over their head it's not even funny. When Durin's Bane appears in Moria, Gandalf tells Aragorn (the Dunedan) to run the fuck away before he's killed. I guarantee you're mistaken about this.

&gt; or are almost a match for an elf, dwarf, or Nazg√ªl in single combat.

First age named elves were powerful, but wood elves like Legolas have zero feats to suggest they're superhuman. They're more agile and have better eyesight, men are larger and stronger. There's no reason to think a man shouldn't be a match for an elf.

Dwarves have better endurance than men, but that's it. They're smaller (with all the disadvantages that implies), and probably strong for their size, but it's never implied they are stronger than men.

I can only think of one man in history (Boromir I) who was implied to be a match for a Nazgul. And Nazgul have - you guessed it - *no feats* to suggest they are superhuman combatants. Their power lies in fear magic.

&gt; Not to mention Boromir's fighting while arrowed feat.

Yes, that I'd label as superhuman. But not drastically so. I don't see that it'd make him stronger than Gregor Clegane.

Why? It's not like Boromir has strength feats or anything, and Gregor does.

&gt; and his speed to slower than a dwarf.

I'm sorry, do you know how fast dwarves are? Because that would make you the only one.

Same goes for Uruk-Hai, how fast are they? They're certainly not as strong as Gregor nor Boromir, given they're about 5 feet tall on average.

"cv6bom9","&gt;Ok, I may have made a mistake in using a term that's well defined into something other than what I meant. My bad.

Fair enough. If you meant to say that ""western"" countries are more *socially* developed than countries run by Islamists, then sure, I'd say that's true, pretty much by definition. I would argue that the lack of progressive views in countries such as Saudi Arabia, Iran and Pakistan is a result largely of the religion there.

&gt;Anyways, let me ask you a question: Are you a christian?

No, I do not participate in religion. I oppose it. You?

The Bible and the Quran both are very nasty, violent books, with the Old Testament probably being the most vicious, the Quran being less vicious, but more encouraging of violent behaviour, and the the New Testament being the least vicious, but the most malevolent. Christianity has been dragged, kicking and screaming, under the control of law and democracy, and few people now follow its doctrine in anything like a fundamental way. In some places, Islam has been put under some measure of control, Jordan being a good example, but unfortunately it is running wild in many parts of the world.",1442612055,"the bible and the quran both are very nasty, violent books, with the old testament probably being the most vicious, the quran being less vicious, but more encouraging of violent behaviour, and the the new testament being the least vicious, but the most malevolent.","vicious, but more","vicious","but",TRUE,"less vicious , but more encouraging","encouraging","less","more",1

"cv0rdyv","The four kingdoms of the world, ruled by 4 queens. We have the happiest kingdom, suicide rates are low over there. The queen in that kingdom loves a good party.

The next kingdom, the smarties, they are the people who build the technology we have. The queen is just smart like that

The next kingdom, is the deadliest kingdom. No one leaves and no one enters. The queen holds that kingdom with an iron grip

Then, the fourth kingdom. They call it the kingdom of loneliness. It is only the queen that lives beyond her walls.

I, myself, live in the party kingdom. But from time to time I would walk the border between this one and the loneliest one.

*ring ring* *ring ring*

""Hello?"" I ask

""Hey jack, you coming to the party tonight?"" my brother said. he sounded high,Does not surprise me one bit.

""Uuugh..i'm kinda tied up at work right now. Boss wants me to stay for overtime"" He knew I was lying, but he accepted my fate.

I decide that night that I will visit that kingdom. Maybe it's not the loneliest one maybe there's secrets to be held there.

I go to the main gate of the kingdom, and open the door

There was no guards, no lights, and only 1 building.

I decide to go in, curiosity killed the cat

It was a moderately sized home, when I entered I felt cold. As if I was walking into a blizzard.

I go up the stairs, and find the queen's living quarters. I knew I was near her because I could hear singing.

I very slowly open up the door, to take a peak of the loneliest occupant in the world. She sat on her desk, looking out the window with her head on top of her arms. She looked at the party kingdom, and sang the tunes I once heard when I went to the big parties. She wore an all black night gown, and she started to yawn

Then I notice her cat, sitting next to her. She started to pet the cat but the cat knew I was here, it just looked in my general direction.

""What's a matter kitty?"" she said, in that voice everyone is forced to do when ""talking"" to a pet

I decided that maaybe I will get caught if I look more, so I close the door and walk off and leave the kingdom.

The next night, I decided to come back. I am by no means a sociable person and have felt loneliness before but to be alone for this long must be dreadful 

I get back to her main door in her home, and she was singing again. The cat was not with her

""meow"" the cat said, and walked into the room touching my leg.

The girl did not even look toward the cat though.

""Kitty!"" she said, happily. She must have been with the cat for a long time, the cat was black and looked passive enough. Same old song and danced happened though, so I left.

The third night, I came back to see her crying, and the cat was nowhere to be seen.

""Kitty!"" she said, petrified.

""Come back kitty!"" she then said, the cat must have ran away. She was balling though, I decide to go find the cat.

For a week, I searched for the cat. Eventually, I found it in an alleyway all alone.

""Come on kitty, time to go home"" I picked it up and it accepted.

I go back, to deliver the lady her cat. I open the door a peek one more time, she seemed just as bad as I saw her as. 

I put the cat down on the floor, and let it rejoice with the owner.

As I leave, I could hear the happiness of her sprawl out. I know I had done a good deed.

For a week, I did not return to her house, but after the week ended I was banished from the kingdom for a crime I did not commit. I started to hate that place anyways.

I enter the loneliest kingdom, and go to an open field to look at the stars.

I question what i'm gonna do now, Do I go to one of the other kingdoms or try to get back into my old one. I am not smart enough for the wise kingdom nor am I tuff enough for the deadliest one. I end up having to stay here, in the loneliest one.

I go in the house, and do my routine of stalking the queen. Nothing else to do. 

She seemed happy, hugging her cat, but as the night passed she let go of the cat. The cat came closer to the door, and soon she started to pay attention as she was getting ready for bed

""Kitty, where you going--"" she said, then she saw me. I ran off as fast as I could, I would rather not be banished from 2 kingdoms tonight. The cat followed me through, to the field I saw the stars at.

""Ah kitty"" I said, and started to pet it. Normally cats are mean and vicious, but this one was calm.

the cat started to purr, and I looked at the stars again with it on my lap

I ended up falling asleep on that very spot, I woke up in the queen's bed next to the cat.

""huh?!"" I said, a little bit startled. She must have picked me up, I am a heavy sleeper so it's not that far fetched.

She opened the door, she wore a nice black t-shirt and jeans

""Hi!"" she said

""You are the one who brought back my kitty!"" she said, she blushed a little bit and smiled.

""Yeah, I guess I am.""

""So you were stalking me?""

""Yeeahh, about that.""

she seemed to take it well though.

""You wanna know why it's just me and the cat?"" she asked.

""Sure""

""The four queens are sisters, I was the youngest. As time passed we all showed differences. One liked to beat kids up, one liked to party, one liked to study. I had nothing, I just sat there and existed.""

""Then, I found my kitty a couple of years ago. Ya see my sisters are all the same besides me in one way, they all hate animals""

then I realise that there are not really any animals owned by the queen's, dogs are usually living with the bums.

""They at first tried to make them leave, that didn't work. then they--"" she started to frown, but I got the picture.

""Kitty, found me, as a kitty. in my kingdom."" she said

""No one likes me besides this cat"" she says

""That's not true"" I said

""I like you"" I said, and smiled.

she smiled back, and laid on the bed with me.

""Why did you come over here?"" she asked

""To see if it was true at first, then you provided me with a different sense then party all day which I was getting tired of""

""I found your cat for you, and I thought you didn't want me here--"" I said, but she kissed me before I can end the sentence

""Stay with me"" she said, and smiled.

""I have kitty, but i'm still lonely""

""Of course"" I said, and hugged her

""I will always be by your side""

"cunla2r","Not to say they couldn't be illithid eggs, but as I recall from my 3.5 readings, they directly insert larva (hence why young larval forms are kept in the brine pool around an Elder Brain while older ones which grow too much become hunted by illithids).

Regardless, I kind of see two good approaches here: 

Firstly, you could take a more lovecraftian approach wherein a well-educated man, such as a physician or an early anthropologist was exposed to a number of... unsightly and inexplicable happenings. Perhaps he asked a few too many questions and found himself on the radar of a cult (though not the entity which they worship, as Great Old Ones are generally so ancient, foreign, and imperceptible that humans seem as inconsequential as ants to them).

The second approach, which is not mutually exclusive with the first, is that the poor soul you fed the eggs two was himself on the verge of insanity, whoever he once was. Perhaps he was just a tramp on the street, or maybe he was the son of an artisan, but one night he began to have dreams and nightmares of ancient and dark cities. He may not know this patron either, but somehow the cult learned of him and perhaps assumed that he had some greater purpose to attend to.

Both approaches leave you quite a bit of room to work with. Perhaps in their insanity, the person you fed the eggs to became quite vicious, but few resources discussing anything of Great Old Ones or anything of the like would suggest that any particular type of person is more or less prone to the madness they instill. In D&amp;D terminology, Great Old Ones are usually considered evil at least insofar as they see absolutely no value in the lives of other creatures, and are quick to (consciously or unconsciously) make thralls and slaves among them.",1441151415,"perhaps in their insanity, the person you fed the eggs to became quite vicious, but few resources discussing anything of great old ones or anything of the like would suggest that any particular type of person is more or less prone to the madness they instill.","vicious, but few","vicious","but",TRUE,"quite vicious , but few","few","quite",NA,1
"cumd249","Oh yes. I understood what you meant: lots of heat, but not much light.

I'm not sure I would agree that it won't make any difference to the election. Unfortunately, I suspect that the difference it makes will not be to any individual party.

Let me explain that because what really concerns me is the cost of public perception of StatsCan. Almost regardless of what the report says tomorrow at least one party, and possibly more, are going to try and diminish the impact of the report on their election strategy by attacking the report via the data or the institution.

In the past, as I recall it, StatsCan released its reports and the parties simply spun the output to fit their narrative. StatsCan was respected and trusted and few people would've believed accusations of meddling, lapsed credibility, or partisanship. Today, I'm not so sure. Independent bodies have become legitimate targets these days.

"cub7656","Snape on the good side, but he's not a good man. He's a bully and an asshole but at the same time, he's also an immensely complex individual. I've written my thoughts on him in another post...I'll show it here, with a couple of edits to add to my original post:

&gt; Snape was cruel, mean and vicious...but he was not a terrible person. He had terrible sides certainly, but that was not all there was to him though it was the side shown most often. Snape was a man who never allowed himself to heal.

&gt; He was raised in an abusive, harsh environment. He never received support or love except from one person whom he loved more than anything, and whom he ruined any chance he had with her. Yes, there are other characters in the series who suffer and who become better, even great people. 

&gt; Snape isn't one of them - he is himself. Not everyone can get over things which have deeply wounded them. Time doesn't heal all wounds.

&gt; People can be in the same situation, but because people are individuals, that same situation will have many different outcomes. Snape's destiny was of his own molding, his own making. 

&gt; He is an excellent example of a character who is on the side of good, but not necessarily a good person.

&gt; Severus was a deeply flawed, complex, contradictory individual. He had his horrible side and his great side. He was a mixture, a clash of the best and the worst. He was two sides of the same coin; light and darkness, night and day.

&gt; He was a bully...and a savior.

&gt; He was a traitor...he was loyalty defined.

&gt; He was petty...he was just.

&gt; He was selfish...he sacrificed.

&gt; He was cruelty...he was honor.

&gt; He loathed for years...he loved for a lifetime.

Final thoughts...Snape never let himself grow up and beyond what happened to him in the past and his portrayal is consistent in that. Yet...his covert actions, the risk he took for years and the lies he covered himself with for the public show his enormous capacity to care about people and work for the good of them even at the cost of his own image. If Snape had been raised in a different household, if he had been shown proper care, love and understanding from people in his youth he would have been a different person. 

Snape is a man who takes pleasure in bullying children...and he's a man who risks his life to save the wizarding world at the same time. 

Such a fascinating character who is far too convoluted and layered to be defined simply. He was a man of contradictions but in the end, he was a man who lived his life for others until he took his final breaths. 

Absolutely my favorite character from the entire series, always. ",1440196339,"i'll show it here, with a couple of edits to add to my original post:  &gt; snape was cruel, mean and vicious...but he was not a terrible person.","mean and vicious","vicious",NA,FALSE,"mean and vicious","mean",NA,NA,0

I found this sub because of [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/3gw4a1/the_harry_potter_rankdown_has_finished_its_bottom/) thread, and I have to disagree with this ranking.

In my opinion, Umbridge was one of the best characters in the entire series. I may be biased because OotP was my favorite book, but I'm going to attempt to pick apart your argument and offer a counter-argument.

&gt;In Harry Potter and the Order of the Pheonix, 'Professor' Umbridge's horror in the face of Voldemort's return causes her to lash out at Harry and the rest of the DA.

Umbridge doesn't lash out at Harry and the D.A. because she's afraid of Voldemort. She lashes out because she is a *twisted, horrible person.* Voldemort is *the reason Fudge sent her to Hogwarts,* not the reason she acts the way she does.

&gt;Her use of dark magic, including unforgivable curses to subdue those that would speak frightening truths is so extreme, it is not believable.

In case you forgot, Umbridge sent dementors after Harry *at the start of the book.* You think her using the Crutacious Curse isn't believable??

&gt;This is especially true as she stoops to using the tools that she disdains due to her fear.

She doesn't fear or disdain the tools themselves. Umbridge is not above any means of torture upon others. She has an element of fear, but it is more about denial of Voldemort's return and keeping her rank at the Ministry/Hogwarts than anything.

&gt;Dolores Umbridge comes off as a one-dimensional villain so bigoted, extreme, and unthinkingly vicious

Umbridge is far from one-dimensional. Yes, she is bigoted and vicious, but she is so much more than that. She has the sickly sweet appearance, she acts innocent to her higher-ups, she is malicious towards anyone who opposes her, but she is a kiss-ass and she rewards those who do her twisted bidding (Inquisitorial Squad). More on dimensions later.

&gt;we wonder how she came to be in her esteemed position, as it is apparent she lacks all vestiges of the cunning she is meant to have.

The hell we do. This *w*itch sucks up to her superiors, and parrots everything they do. She simpers up to them, but never loses an opportunity to wrong those beneath her and elevate her own position. She talks sweet to those she can get something from, and crushes those she can't. That's how her brand of cunning works.

&gt;Umbrdge actively helps the Death Eaters, despite the fact that she is not one herself and despite that it was her fear of Voldemort that causes her extreme reaction in OoTP.

Not exactly. She was a monster to the muggle-borns during the Ministry investigations, if that's what you're referencing. However, quoting Sirius, ""the world isn't split into good people and Death Eaters."" Umbridge tried to de-legitimize Muggle borns because she enjoys others suffering. She didn't do it because she was afraid of the Death Eaters/Voldemort controlling the ministry, she did it because they *gave her the opportunity.*

&gt;with only the context we have, she comes off as mindlessly cruel and bigoted for no reason the reader can easily discern.

Well, you're right that she comes off as cruel and bigoted. But it's not hard for the reader to figure out why. She craves power, and the way she knows to obtain it is to act nice and wonderful and simpering to those above her, while denying everyone under her. She gets a very common thing among villains: schadenfreude - pleasure derived from the misery of others.

&gt;she is an ambitious and cunning Slytherin that might have become somewhat bigoted due to her upbringing. This changes as soon as she arrives at Hogwarts.

The hell? No it doesn't. She remains power hungry, intolerant of both minorities she fears and opposition.

&gt;Umbridge begins to be mindlessly cruel, even when it would not serve her purpose, such as purposefully antagonizing 3/4 of the school as opposed to genuinely indoctrinating them to her beliefs and rallying them against Harry.

Umbridge was cruel and horrible long before she arrived at Hogwarts, shown by the fact that she set dementors on Harry at the start of OotP. She antagonized the majority of the school because she is a horrid and cruel person that no one lower ranking than her isn't going to recognize.

&gt;[These children would have been easily swayed, and perhaps swayed their families as a result, and the 15-17 year olds who made up the upper years would fight in any impending war.]

No way in hell. The woman is a psychopath, anyone who had to bear one class with her stood no chance of believing any indoctrination she chucked their way. Parents worried about their kids are another matter, but for the kids themselves, she is a Trunchbull-esque character not to be followed (except by the already-borderline-evil Slytherins).

&gt;Dolores Umbridge is yet another one-dimensional Slytherin used as a caricature of sociopathy to further the Gryffindor/Slytherin dichotomy throughout the series. She reduces complexity of the series rather than adding to it, because she is so one-dimensional herself.

Dolores Umbridge is far from one-dimensional. I can see how someone could see her as such - she acts so evil it's hard to see her as anything but a standard villain. **However,** Umbridge is not a standard villain. Voldemort is the standard, Darth Vader villain. He's evil for the sake of being evil, achieving immortality, crushing non-purebloods, ruling the world and whatever else, but we as readers don't want to *punch his fucking lights out.* We readers hate Umbridge because we feel like we know her personally. She is the embodiment of every bully we've ever faced, every sibling that lied to our parents about us, every teacher that we've had that has punished us unfairly, every horrible person we've ever met that we can't do anything about, but instead have to deal with no matter how despicable they might be. We **love** to hate Umbridge because she relates directly to our lives in a way that Hitler-like Voldemort never could. She is multi-dimensional not only because of the different sides she shows to different people based on rank and opposition, not only because she displays new levels of cruelty every time she shows up, not only because she singles out the main character and we see different sides of her - her cunning, her cleverness, her rudeness, and her reactions to being in different levels of control, but because readers pin things *from their own lives* on her, and she becomes everything we despise.

Umbridge is the perfect villain, and she deserves a very high ranking on this list, **not** a very low one. Putting her below Piers Polkiss, Marietta Edgecombe, and Karkus is nothing short of disgraceful.

5.) This will be a little tougher for Tyson. 2 on 1 still isn't enough for wolves to be completely comfortable in this fight. Presuming they start off in the center, wolves will get a couple good bites in but Tyson should be able to take them down.

6.) This is harder. Mountain Lions usually prefer to stalk their prey. Mountain Lions are usually around 140lbs so they don't have the sheer mass on their side to actually tackle Mike. Mike 7/10 providing he plays it smart because if the lion gets its jaws around his wrist or leg, it will just drag Mike off of his feet and from there its over for him.

7.) Ah yes the age-old questions. Wolves will stomp. This is an ideal situation for them, they will surround Mike, the minute he focuses on one wolf, the other two will be biting his legs and dragging him off balance. Wolves 8/10.

8) Dude chimps are insane. They have wars with each other and they are surprisingly fast and durable. Insanely vicious. A chimp will just throw himself at Mike and beat the ever-loving shit out of him. Mike just hasn't been trained for that sort of fight. He has the opportunity to get maybe two hits in before its on top of him beating his head. Chimp 8/10.

9.) Lol. Nope. Assuming the gorilla actually wants to fight (because they are surprisingly chill). There isn't anything Mike can do to stop him. The gorilla will charge him, knock him off his ~~feat~~ Edit: feet, and bash his skull in. Gorilla 10/10.

"ctltpe0","Republicans and Democrats, the battle of two diametrically opposed forces? Give me a break. It's the battle between Christian humanism and Universalist humanism. That's it. It's even weirder too if you compare the United States to the USSR, with the neo-cons being the hated Trotskyites (with spreading democracy being their form of permanent revolution), and the mainline progressives being the Stalinists, but I digress. This is why everyone that's in NRx or altright thinks conservatives are a fucking joke, they don't stand for anything. They just stand like 10% to the right of the left. As the left shifts, the ""conservative"" right shifts with it. 

Cuckservative is simply a term to describe their complete unwillingness to stand where they are. Look every political party is in some way an ethno-religion, the democrats are the party of white out-group favoritists, as well racial nationalists of other races. The republican party is for in-group favoritist whites. The reason they got cucked was because they don't care about that core voting block or maintaining it, and they don't stand for any of the real traditional Christian values to any meaningful degree. Yea they can bitch about abortion and gay marriage all they want. They can bitch about illegal immigrants all day. But what about the straight marriages that aren't taking place? What about the conservative children that are not being born regardless of abortion? This is why the alt-Right emerged, it was out of sheer political weakness of the Republicans. 

Furthermore there's a great fear I have that once America breaks down, these ""take America back"" people will attack actual right-wing separatists. That's why I think the take America back thing is probably a psy-op (although I don't generally believe in conspiracies). Because how do you destroy separatist movements, well you take a lot of really dumb people (Americultists) and have them fight the battles for you. It will be quite damaging if they do this when we just want some land and to be left alone. But no we have to keep the monstrosity together, to keep Murica strong and all that bullshit. 

American conservatives are by far some of the most naive people on the planet. Progressives are not naive, they are unbelievably cruel and vicious but I think at the end of the day they know exactly what they are doing. Take the recent black riots in Ferguson and Baltimore, the calls from the conservative media condemning the riots. Look dummy, people are not going to change, whether they are black, brown, white liberal cuckold, it's irrelevant. If conservatives truly knew what was good for them they would have tried to break off from America decades ago. And divide America into separate zones based on ideological/racial lines.

"ct4bth7","A copy and paste of /u/CourierOfTheWastes comment from the past:

*There's one I found, but it was fan made. I don't know if you'd want it, but I'mma sharing it anyway, just in case. The recipient of the soulgaze is a pure innocent female mortal who isn't human nor has ever seen one before Harry.*

&gt;It began in an enormous city of stone and glass. The surrounding details were hazy, as though a spotlight shone only on the creature in front of her. He appeared the same, except he was missing the black coat from before.

&gt;His bare torso, the same peach color as his hands, was covered in wounds. Some were white lines, old and scarred, and some were so fresh they were still wrapped in red-stained bandages.

&gt;As she watched, he put on a suit of medieval armor in a spartan, lonely room. He rose, sword in hand, and went out into the strange city. He walked lightly, a smile on his face, but she could see that he had a heavy purpose in mind. Most of the city's people ignored him, some jeered at him. He ignored both.

&gt;They arrived at the edge of the city just as the sun was setting. In the soft glow of dusk he stood on an open plain between the city and a wild, tangled forest. As the light dimmed, monsters began to appear, slinking out of the growing shadows until a multitude of them waited, arrayed against him. They were horrifying, all of them, each in its own unique way. She had never seen anything like them, and she recoiled in fear from their drooling jaws and blood-stained claws.

&gt;As one, the creatures of night bellowed their challenge to the lone warrior. He was unbowed by the wave of sound and held his ground. As the lingering echoes died away he responded. He laughed at them, loud and cocky, and then made a one-fingered gesture She didn't fully understand. The monsters did, and they screamed in fury even as they charged him.

&gt;What followed was the most violent and frightening thing she had ever seen. All of the horrors were quick and vicious, but the man was quicker still and his swordplay was that of a true master.

&gt;Perhaps he lacked the finesse of a more experienced knight, but as he bisected one unlucky foe, she realized he had more than enough power to make up for it. He fought against insane odds, never giving ground to the darkness. The black blood of the creatures flew as his sword cut corrupted flesh, but crimson blood flowed steadily from the many wounds he received in return. Much later, the full moon rose over a silent battlefield, the beasts were dead or had fled, and the warrior stood alone, breathing raggedly.

&gt;He was so covered in the black blood of his enemies that he resembled them more than any of his city's people. Then she noticed something she hadn't before; his eyes were mismatched.

&gt;One was a brown so bright it bordered on gold. That eye was full of honor and strength, and tired as he was, it still blazed like a torch. The other, though, was a brown so dark that it appeared black. It didn't blaze, it smoldered. Rage, pain, cruelty and an unquenchable lust for power lived in that eye.

&gt;She realized that there stood the real battle, within the heart of the warrior. Every time he fought, he walked the knife's edge between using his power and letting it use him, but at the same time, he couldn't stop fighting for his city. She felt an intense surge of emotion, equal parts pity and fear, even as the image faded to black.

Booty as fine as that don't need comment, brothah. (I'd started writing something about it being a reference to old rites and such, but I'm fuzzy enough on the details that it would have been empty fluff.)

But seriously, Aviendha is Aiel and a former Maiden, she probably has the booty of a goddess.

&gt;I feel that she started out smarter, but all her failures are kinda getting to her. Remember, she managed to convince all these Wise Ones to follow her, murder and fight for her, and basically they were her bitches until Therava and co. realised they were stronger.

I think it's more down to Aiel tradition. As the widow of the clan chief she speaks for him until they have a new clan chief, and I think that her initial control of the Shaido Wise Ones stemmed more from their respect for the Aiel traditions and the authority of the clan chief than anything else.

Once the shit well and truly had started to hit the fan, Sevanna's influence started to erode, because the Wise Ones pretty much collectively decided that tradition was already breaking down far enough that they didn't really feel the need to listen to Sevanna any more.

Remember, Sevanna literally slept her way to the top. She can be cunning and vicious, but in many ways she seems to be a reference to that general ""evil woman using sex for power"" trope, and arguably a deconstruction of it considering how quickly things went downhill under her lead.

"css6i40","A better sub to ask this in might be a dnd or pathfinder sub. This sub's more about inventing your own kinds of hobgoblins, orcs, and drow.

But while you're here:

Drow don't give a damn about hobgoblin and orc lives. they might not waste them, exactly, unless they're stupid, but they have a very low threshold for how much they can get by throwing them into a meat grinder.

The hobs and orcs will not get along unless totally beaten into submission. They're both brutal racial supremacists. There the similarities end.

Hobs are LE, orcs are CE. Hobs seek a world-spanning hobgoblin empire. They're slavers and tyrants, paranoid and vicious, but organized enough to cooperate, at least with their own tribe. They have a formal internal hierarchy that goes beyond ""tha boss killed the last boss.""

Orcs, by comparison, rule by force, even among themselves. If an orc boss looks vulnerable, you bet someone's going to be taking their chances on him. Unlike hobs, they don't really care about establishing an empire - as a culture, they don't think that far ahead, though individual orcs might.

Force these two to work together? Not sure. You'd need to overcome both races' xenophobia. Figure you do that by coercing the leaders into working together, magically or otherwise, and then buffing them so that the hobgoblin one doesn't get ousted by his subordinates that suspect something's wrong and so the orc doesn't get ousted by the weekly assassination attempts that are par for the course in orc society.

"csqhz5l","Digging deep into the history of the American Civil War. If we define the peak the Union Army at around 600,000 soldiers, then I suppose we are talk about the time period between July 1862 and May 1863 (when the Western and Eastern Theatre were heavily engaged). This means the Gatling gun is not in play since Union commanders didn't use it in the trenches until the siege of Petersburg, VA in June 1864. If we look at the Civil War Artillery the Union would have three main cannons: Parrott Rifle and Ordnance Rifle, both rifled 3in cannons firing 12, 20 and 30 pounders very accurately up to a mile in distance; and the more popular Napoleon cannon which was a 3in 12 pounder that fired canister shot up to 300 yards away accurately and solid shot all the way up to a mile in distance inaccurately (however it was more reliable than the other two). The Whitworth cannon was Confederate, so we won't talk about it. The most popular rifles for the North were the (at first) the Enfield Model 1853 (.58cal) muzzle-loader effective up to 600 yards. Then the North adopted the Springfield Model 1861(first rifle with iron sights) (.58cal) muzzle-loader effective up to 600 yards (sights were target ready up to 500 yards). Colt Special Model 1861 was a copy of the Springfield Model 1861. J.F. Brown Target / Sniper Rifle, only a few got these. Burnside Carbine (.54cal) was a breech loading rifle effective out to 200 yards. The Henry Model 1860 Lever Action Repeating Rifle saw very limited use during the Civil war; by 1862 there were only 900 around (most of them in the North). The most popular pistols were single action 6-shooters: The Remington Model 1858 Army, Remington Model 1861 Army, and the Colt Model 1860 New Army all which effective ranges between 75-100 yards.

Women of the Civil War: Sarah Emma Edmonds Union soldier and active fighter in the Battle of Williamsburg. Jennie Hodgers active soldier in the 5th Illinois Infantry, veteran of over 40 engagements. Sarah Rosetta Wakeman's combat during the war was after our allotted time frame. Loreta Janeta Velazquez fought for the Confederacy.

Uruk-hai might be badass but Orcs/Goblins are not. 

Physically, they were short in stature. They are not dim-witted, but are clever and crafty. Their tools and weapons, however, are of poor quality. They are known to quarrel and kill each other over petty things. Without firm leadership, Orcs have been known to go into battle in complete disarray and without any resemblance of formation or tactics. Their strength in combat comes from numbers and sheer violence. Due to superior organization, training and weaponry, Men, Dwarves, Elves, and at times even Hobbits, are able to defeat larger numbers of Orcs, provided they are able to withstand the horror and shock of the initial onslaught.[[1]](http://lotr.wikia.com/wiki/Orcs)

Troll were strong and vicious, but generally dim-witted and stupid at best. The major weakness of at least some Trolls was that they turned to stone in sunlight. Their hide was as thick as stone and nigh-impervious to physical attacks.[[2]](http://lotr.wikia.com/wiki/Trolls#cite_ref-0)

The Nazg√ªl (or named Ringwraiths, sometimes written Ring-wraiths; also referred to as the Black Riders or as the Nine; or the Ulairi in Quenya) were the dreaded ring-servants of the Dark Lord Sauron. The Nazg√ªl were sustained by the power of Sauron. The Witch-king in particular was difficult to slay, for any weapon that struck him would be destroyed. The Nazg√ªl's own weapons included long swords of steel and daggers. Their leader possessed a powerful black mace as well. Their arsenal of deadly armaments was not confined to physical means; they also had powerful voices, which brought terror into the hearts of mortals and a general aura of dread. They wore hauberks of silver mail and had enhanced senses of hearing and smell. The Nine could not see during the day as mortals do; instead they see shadowy forms. During the night they see many signs and forms invisible to mortal eyes; it is at night that they are to be feared most. They can smell the blood of living things that they desire and hate. Their presence can be felt as a troubling of the heart, and they can more keenly feel the presence of others. Though the Ringwraiths were among the greatest of Sauron's servants, they also had certain weaknesses that could be used against them. One of these was daylight itself. With the exception of the Witch-King of Angmar, none of them (especially Kham√ªl) could operate as well under the Sun and generally feared it. All the Ringwraiths but the Witch-King fear water. The Nazg√ªl received winged creatures from Sauron in addition to new horses. With these fell beasts, the nine attacked the ruined city of Osgiliath in order to clear the way for a siege on Minas Tirith. Subsequently, the Nazg√ªl used the fell beasts to their advantage at the Battle of the Pelennor Fields and the Battle of the Morannon.[[3]](http://lotr.wikia.com/wiki/Nazg%C3%BBl)

------------

The way I see it, the American Civil War Union Army can easily kill 3 Orcs/Goblins a piece with very minimal casualties (if any). Even if the battle took place at night; the cannons, rifle fire, and mounted cav should be enough to last until dawn. After that the sunlight will turn all trolls to stone and they will be destroyed. But I don't see Sarah Emma Edmonds or Jennie Hodgers killing the Witch-King of Angmar on a flying fell beast. With this one discrepancy, I can firmly say that the Nazg√ªl Witch-King of Angmar could possible solo the whole army.  The Nazg√ªl on fell beasts is a huge tactical advantage, as nothing in the civil war during that time was advanced enough to deal with air to ground attacks. Maybe after hundreds, thousands , or tens of thousands of casualties they may ground all the Nazg√ªl. But the Witch-King of Angmar (even on the ground) is a major trump card.

Check out *Age of Arthur*. It's an amazing low-fantasy game exploring the setting of Arthurian myth and the dark ages British isles.

"crugyjn","The TWD story is much more straightforward:

Rick awakes from a coma to find himself in the zombie apocalypse. Let's follow him as he finds his son and leads a small band of survivors into a zombie-filled dystopia and battles the worst humanity has to offer.

Now, how the hell do you do that with GoT? It is, by design, the LEAST straightforward series/story that I can think of off the top of my head. The White Walkers/wights that the Night's King leads are an existential threat, to be sure, but by and large are like &lt; 5% of the story.

"cruckyh","When the ships appeared in the sky we had no warning. It wasn't quite like the movies. They didn't just attack the United States, or go after the landmarks like Big Ben and the Eiffel tower. They went after New york yeah, but only because of its size. In fact they targeted based on largest populations, so the first attacks came in Asia. Tokyo, Seoul, Shanghai, Karachi, Delhi, had immediate blackouts. 

The order of surrender didn't come in the form of a White House lawn landing a demand to the president or the UN. Just an overwhelming broadcast on all frequencies in Chinese, English and Spanish. They simply stated they had no regard for our culture or nations and that we were to submit to Imperial rule and governance. After that they just started looping it. 

Within minutes every military in the world was on full alert. Just as quickly the aliens began to land. We had no idea what they were, what they looked like, or where they came from. Just that they were coming for us. It didn't take long for orders to appear. My part in this started when my battalion was the closest to the Dallas Texas invasion zone. They hit dirt about the same time we got there. 

The flashes in the sky told me the Air Force fly boys were already at work earning their paychecks for once. The Chinooks put us down outside a suburb where the cops were busy evacuating civilians with National Guard starting to trickle in to help them. There was no time for an forward base to setup the aliens had already begun digging in themselves. Command wanted us to prevent that from happening. 

So we rallied up and started towards them. We could see the column of ships rising and falling from their landing zone with a swarm of aircraft and explosions around it. As we got closer we started seeing wreckage of jets and whatever they used. The green flames and purple smoke were eerie.  Then our APCs and Tanks crested a rise and we saw them, already numbering in the hundreds. 

A field of white armor, and gray war machines. Prefabricated buildings and huge armor pieces were being carried into place whole straight from orbit. They wasted no time opening fire. The Hummer next to us evaporated in one hit, everybody else began the shoot and scoot routine. We popped out of the carriers and began moving through cover. The Open Field was obviously going to get us killed in a hurry. 

The distance closed quick. A buzzing hum was our only warning before flying bikes began ripping through us. Air support was trying to get through but spotty at best. Getting a hit was tricky but the RPGs could take out the smaller craft. Then we finally got personally acquainted with the Stormtroopers. They were covered head to toe in thick ballistic plate armor. Some kind of mix of ceramics and plastic.  

Nothing smaller than a .44 could punch through it, so we had to go after the soft spots in the gaps. They had smart tactics but weren't afraid to swarm and lose numbers. They were using something not quite like a ray gun. They weren't lasers like we know them that go straight out and have continuous line. Rather they were bolts with a slight explosive effect. They burned like hell though. I took a couple near hits, and the wounds were cauterized by themselves. 

The tanks and vehicles had better luck than us grunts. Once a full armored division showed up we managed to start pushing them back a bit. They were jamming our radios so we had to resort to hard lines a lot. Air support was failing, and we couldn't get into the their forward base. So when artillery came online it was a god send. 

They had started putting up some kind of barrier though. Hard bombardment punched through with after a few volleys. We cheered when the explosions shook the ground. The cheers stopped when the walkers came. The small two legged ones were fast and vicious but concentrated fire could take them out. The four legged ones were much harder. My battalion had been cut to shreds but we were told to stay in it. 

The entire armor division was reduced to ribbons by just two of the towering four legs monsters. Finally they went down after the chopper pilots got creative with their cargo winches. The artillery kept up the rest of the day until we were forced to ground by the Empire's air patrols. Finally we had reduced their LZ to rubble. We were too tired to celebrate. 

It was almost midnight as my squad started picking over the remains of the enemy forward base. Command had stated it was imperative to capture and re-purpose enemy tech. Then the sky lit up. I looked and watched as a storm of green bolts began to stream down from orbit. We ran but it didn't take long to realize we weren't the main target. Dallas was. 

I watched the city I had spent my weekend in burn to the ground in a couple hours, helpless to stop it. The Empire was cold and ruthless, and willing to do anything to win. I sank to my knees and cried then, knowing the end would not come quickly.

"cqu3gp4","It depends a lot on where you are in the country. The US is a unique situation, partly due to how many other cultures we've absorbed. There are distinct cultural groups, and sociologists have established anywhere from 4-12 different cultures in the US. A lot of our political rancor comes from how different the Deep South is, from, say the Pacific Northwest. Or New England and the Great Plains. Hawaii is so different from the rest of the country it's almost a marvel they don't try to secede, from my point of view.

I'd also disagree that we're the most racist, particularly towards Arabs, among western countries. Switzerland banned minarets because they didn't want mosques. Hyperconservative nationalists parties like the Golden Dawn actually win elections in Europe. At least here the racists have to use dog whistle politics to avoid alientating the rest of the country.

There's definitely a dark side to the US, though. We aren't perfect by any stretch, which is why I would never call America better than another country. I think American Exceptionalism (the idea that America is special and better, the idealogy that basically spawned the MURICA meme) is deeply embarrassing, not the least of which because it's so popular.

Hydra and those affiliated are a very interesting group of string pullers providing the conspiracy and espionage elements of the Marvel Universe.

There really is no way to answer this unless you do it for yourself.

You basically have a hex based map with some cities and land. On your turn you play your hand which can either expand your line, upgrade cities (which then are worth points) and then you can buy more cards with your funds. Playing cards will add waste cards into your deck, which when drawn do absolutely nothing. It's like a curse card in Dominion.

&gt; It began in an enormous city of stone and glass. The surrounding details were hazy, as though a spotlight shone only on the creature in front of her. He appeared the same, except he was missing the black coat from before. 
&gt; 
&gt; His bare torso, the same peach color as his hands, was covered in wounds. Some were white lines, old and scarred, and some were so fresh they were still wrapped in red-stained bandages. 
&gt; 
&gt; As she watched, he put on a suit of medieval armor in a spartan, lonely room. He rose, sword in hand, and went out into the strange city. He walked lightly, a smile on his face, but she could see that he had a heavy purpose in mind. Most of the city's people ignored him, some jeered at him. He ignored both. 
&gt; 
&gt; They arrived at the edge of the city just as the sun was setting. In the soft glow of dusk he stood on an open plain between the city and a wild, tangled forest. As the light dimmed, monsters began to appear, slinking out of the growing shadows until a multitude of them waited, arrayed against him. They were horrifying, all of them, each in its own unique way. She had never seen anything like them, and she recoiled in fear from their drooling jaws and blood-stained claws. 
&gt; 
&gt; As one, the creatures of night bellowed their challenge to the lone warrior. He was unbowed by the wave of sound and held his ground. As the lingering echoes died away he responded. He laughed at them, loud and cocky, and then made a one-fingered gesture She didn't fully understand. The monsters did, and they screamed in fury even as they charged him. 
&gt; 
&gt; What followed was the most violent and frightening thing she had ever seen. All of the horrors were quick and vicious, but the man was quicker still and his swordplay was that of a true master. 
&gt; 
&gt; Perhaps he lacked the finesse of a more experienced knight, but as he bisected one unlucky foe, she realized he had more than enough power to make up for it. He fought against insane odds, never giving ground to the darkness. The black blood of the creatures flew as his sword cut corrupted flesh, but crimson blood flowed steadily from the many wounds he received in return. Much later, the full moon rose over a silent battlefield, the beasts were dead or had fled, and the warrior stood alone, breathing raggedly. 
&gt; 
&gt; He was so covered in the black blood of his enemies that he resembled them more than any of his city's people. Then she noticed something she hadn't before; his eyes were mismatched. 
&gt; 
&gt; One was a brown so bright it bordered on gold. That eye was full of honor and strength, and tired as he was, it still blazed like a torch. The other, though, was a brown so dark that it appeared black. It didn't blaze, it smoldered. Rage, pain, cruelty and an unquenchable lust for power lived in that eye. 
&gt; 
&gt; She realized that there stood the real battle, within the heart of the warrior. Every time he fought, he walked the knife's edge between using his power and letting it use him, but at the same time, he couldn't stop fighting for his city.

"clrgh42","My personal favourite outside view of Dresden is a Soul Gaze from a fanfic:

""It began in an enormous city of stone and glass. The surrounding details were hazy, as though a spotlight shone only on the creature in front of her. He appeared the same, except he was missing the black coat from before. His bare torso, the same peach color as his hands, was covered in wounds. Some were white lines, old and scarred, and some were so fresh they were still wrapped in red-stained bandages. As she watched, he put on a suit of medieval armor in a spartan, lonely room. He rose, sword in hand, and went out into the strange city. He walked lightly, a smile on his face, but Twilight could see that he had a heavy purpose in mind. Most of the city‚Äôs people ignored him, some jeered at him. He ignored both. They arrived at the edge of the city just as the sun was setting. In the soft glow of dusk he stood on an open plain between the city and a wild, tangled forest. As the light dimmed, monsters began to appear, slinking out of the growing shadows until a multitude of them waited, arrayed against him. They were horrifying, all of them, each in its own unique way. Twilight had never seen anything like them, and she recoiled in fear from their drooling jaws and blood-stained claws. As one, the creatures of night bellowed their challenge to the lone warrior. He was unbowed by the wave of sound and held his ground. As the lingering echoes died away he responded.

He laughed at them, loud and cocky, and made a one-fingered gesture Twilight didn‚Äôt fully understand. The monsters did, and they screamed in fury even as they charged him. What followed was the most violent and frightening thing she had ever seen. All of the horrors were quick and vicious, but the man was quicker still and his swordplay was that of a true master. Perhaps he lacked the finesse of a more experienced knight, but as he bisected one unlucky foe, Twilight realized he had more than enough power to make up for it. He fought against insane odds, never giving ground to the darkness. The black blood of the creatures flew as his sword cut corrupted flesh, but crimson blood flowed steadily from the many wounds he received in return. Much later, the full moon rose over a silent battlefield, the beasts were dead or had fled, and the warrior stood alone, breathing raggedly. He was so covered in the black blood of his enemies that he resembled them more than any of his city‚Äôs people. Then Twilight noticed something she hadn‚Äôt before; his eyes were mismatched. One was a brown so bright it bordered on gold. That eye was full of honor and strength, and tired as he was, it still blazed like a torch. The other, though, was a brown so dark that it appeared black. It didn‚Äôt blaze, it smoldered. Rage, pain, cruelty and an unquenchable lust for power lived in that eye. She realized that there stood the real battle, within the heart of the warrior. Every time he fought, he walked the knife‚Äôs edge between using his power and letting it use him, but at the same time, he couldn‚Äôt stop fighting for his city. Twilight felt an intense surge of emotion, equal parts pity and fear, even as the image faded to black.""",1414989272,"all of the horrors were quick and vicious, but the man was quicker still and his swordplay was that of a true master.","quick and vicious","vicious",NA,FALSE,"quick and vicious","quick",NA,NA,0

"clij7cs","Okay, when I first came to Reddit, I answered a question similar to this, and this is really the scariest thing that happened to me, so I am just going to copy and paste.


Scariest thing....okay, it had to be when my family moved into a really old farmhouse dating back to the 1860s. We were care-taking it, so my dad, who was always really cheap, figured that doing lawn work and tending to the house was going to be a lot cheaper than paying rent every month. Not so. As soon as we moved in, everything started to fall apart. Mold was seeping in through the walls and it had this musty old scent to it. At some point, the whole basement flooded. There were two bathrooms, but one was just too disgusting in the basement and could barely be used and the other one was on the first level, small, and sort of dingy. Worst place I figured I had moved to, considering we were such a big family. This house was on a lot of land that stretched back into the forest and even up a mountain. Sometimes, the dogs would run and go barking at the treeline and every single time my dad would investigate, nothing. I don't know if you have ever heard a dog bark in a vicious, but panicked way, but it gets your attention quickly. It wasn't a ruckus sort of barking, but the ""wolf"" part of them coming out. Anyway, there were three bedrooms upstairs. Really creepy and dark and tilted. The first night I was scared so my sister let me put my cot in her room and just crash there for the night. At some point I woke up and heard loud stomping on the stairs. I figured it was one of our dogs, but the stairs were hardwood and you would have heard the tapping of the dogs nails on the floor. These were like heavy work boots. The creepy thing was that this did not last for five minutes. It went on for about four hours STRAIGHT, never stopping, up and down the stairs, and then it just stopped towards dawn. I brushed it off. Old house, creepy stuff happens. I wasn't going to freak myself out over it. So about a couple of months pass and nothing happens. Well, one night I'm in my big, tall, heavy iron-framed bed, about to go to sleep, and my dog, who is sleeping with me on the bed, starts growling at something underneath it. I am thinking, great, one of the cats have gotten in here, now I'll have to spend the next hour coaxing it out from under the bed. But I am not stupid. I've seen horror movies. You don't get on your hands and knees and peer under the bed, you don't stay on your bed and peer under the bed, so I walked all the way across my room and bent down, still standing, and peeked. As soon as I did, the frame of my bed slid across the room about a good inch. I freaked out. I ran downstairs and pulled my parents up to my room, and even my dad had to admit it had to move because there were fresh marks of where it moved. The creepy thing was that with the movement, it looked like it had actually been picked. *Up.* and moved an inch from the bottom part of the frame. So it made my bed look slanted. I figured gravity--I honestly tried to rationalize it, but that bed frame was real, heavy old iron. My dad couldn't even manage to pick it up. Especially with my thick mattress and box spring? No fudging way. Months passed, nothing happened, and I pushed the memory away and managed to gain some calmness about things. Eventually, time came about five months later and we were preparing to move because my dad was sick and tired of spending all of our money on the house repairs. That's when everything crazy started to happen. All the time, it sounded like someone had taken a big box of glass and shoved it down the stairs. We checked everywhere to see if things had been pushed over or messed with, and everything was in its perfect place as usual. Shadows, creaking, loud noises--I mean, it was chaotic. At some point, my mom was in her room and heard clear as day, ""Mommy."" At another point, I was in the shower and I felt something take its finger and drag it down my whole back. I never said anything because I figured no one would believe me and left it to my own imagination, though I still wonder if it was real or not, because it certainly felt real at the time. I was in the middle of the shower, too, so I couldn't have touched anything. The cabinet doors in the bathroom would also open up most of the time if you were in the shower or bathtub. It was very scary and I am glad we are away from that place. It was like no light could ever get in that house. Anyway, that's the scariest thing that I have experienced--living in that house. The place still creeps me out by just thinking about it. All big and looming--it always managed to cast its own shadow. I still to this day have no idea what happened in that house or what could have caused it. Part of me wants to say ghosts, aliens, supernatural, whatever you want to call it, but the other part of me wants to deny all of it, and I know I can't because others experienced things in that house, too.



Another thing that was scary that happened to me when I was a child was when we were living in another farmhouse. I thought the house was haunted, and since stuff only happened to me, I now believe that perhaps it was just my imagination. But there is one thing that I cannot explain. I was in my room--one of the rare times, as my room was what terrified me the most because of the sounds. I had to turn my TV up at night to block them out just to go to bed. Anyway, I was in my room and I was playing with some barbies and I left my door all the way open. All of a sudden, it just slammed shut with such force that the door frame shook. It happened all in the matter of maybe half a second. I freaked out and ran out of the room. After that, I slept with a Bible and nothing else bothered me again, but I don't know if that was just because I felt safe because I had some sort of protection like the Bible with me. Another thing that happened at this house was that all of my parents and my sisters and one of my brothers left to go to the store. The only person left was my older brother, and he was sleeping in his room. It was around the afternoon and I was walking to the kitchen, passing the staircase, when I heard this woman singing. It was like Native American--maybe?--singing, and it was beautiful, but it was scary, because it was coming from my little brother's room, which was right next to mine. He didn't sleep in his room, especially when a red hand print appeared mysteriously on his wall one day. There was one time when I had to sleep with him so that maybe he could sleep in his room, and he ended up sleeping with me on the lower bunk. I asked him why not the top? That's when he told me that a demon jumps up there at night, and I still get this creepy feeling when I think about it. Anyway, so back to the singing. I hesitated for a moment when I heard it--it was really strong--and I decided to go upstairs. I got to a point on the staircase where I could see the upstairs room. It was most definitely coming in the direction of either my room or my little brother's. As soon as I looked towards that direction, it stopped immediately. I checked if maybe someone had left music on and it just shut off on its own--I don't know, I was just really desperate to know it was just music. I asked my older brother who stayed behind if he was playing music, but he said no and that he was dead asleep during that time. I only heard it. We were all really young, so who the heck knows? But scary stuff happens in old farmhouses.

"clhje85","I'm Malik's main opponent in the race.  My website: [www.michaelsims.ca](http://www.michaelsims.ca).

I don't think Malik would be good for the job because:

1. Since her only support in the election is the NDP party, she has to be a party-line supporter or she'll get turfed out at the next election.  See for example the story of [Cathy Dandy in Toronto-Danforth](http://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2014/10/21/toronto_school_board_race_a_telling_story_of_ndp_internal_politics_walkom.html), a good trustee (diligent, knowledgeable, progressive) who didn't campaign hard enough for Andrea Horwath's ""respect for taxpayers"" provincial campaign and therefore the NDP are trying to run her out of town.  We don't need any more party-line hacks at the school board.

2. She's young, in her 20's.  The Board is made up of nasty old political people.  I hate to sound age-ist, but frankly, you need some life experience if you're not going to get eaten alive by such people.  I don't think she has much chance of being an *effective trustee* at the board.

3. She's not a parent and has no actual experience with the school system.

4. Of all the points above, I think the election rigging is both true and damning.  It suggests she puts party loyalty above personal ethics.  That's a BAD trait in a politician.  She has not addressed it at all.

5. Additionally, raising money for the legal defense of Muslims charged with terrorism in Canada is not illegal, but not in favour with the general public.  The Toronto 18 planned to detonate truck bombs in downtown Toronto.  (And they went to prison for it; many of them are still in prison.)  No one is in favour of that.  That's the sort of thing that would be a career-ender for most politicians. She hasn't addressed that either.

Malik is being attacked by people that, well, let's say ""strongly support"" Israel and are not a fan of Muslims in general.  That's a shame.  I wish Middle Eastern politics weren't so toxic and vicious.  But at least some of their criticisms are real and valid.

I'm a parent of three kids in the public school system.  I'm active in our school; I was president of the board of our local non-profit daycare.  I'm not running for any party; the only people donating to my campaign are my friends and other parents in the school system (not true of Malik!).

I ran in the 2010 election and got about a third of the votes, a bit shy of 10,000 votes.  And that was against a long-time incumbent.  In this election, with no incumbent, my odds are much better.  I'm running again and I feel good about winning this time.  It's not at all true that Malik is a shoe-in for the job.  Trinity-Spadina is NOT an NDP stronghold.  It has traditionally gone back and forth between the Liberals and NDP and the NDP is very definitely on a losing streak in recent years.  Plus I think the public votes differently in municipal races than in provincial and federal ones.  While party politics play a role, voting based on the candidate is much more of a factor.  I'm well-known among a large group of parents for civic activism and engagement in the school system.  I'm getting people every day calling and offering to deliver flyers for me and help in any way they can.

So if you're looking for someone good to vote for, that name again is Michael Sims.  See you at the polls...

"ckjou09","First off, Pit Bulls are supposed to be dog aggressive, not vicious but aggressive.

Mostly you have to change your outlook on dogs, not every dog is a marshmallow family pet, and you have to learn to deal with that and accept it. That doesn't mean give up on training, it just means that you need to lower your expectations, and have a lot of patience.

My dog is very territorial, but over the years he has mellowed out. With him neutering really turned things around, not because intact male dogs are mean, but he had a prostate inflammation due to smelling females and having no release, with that pent up stress it caused him to be more aggressive than he naturally would be.

I've never felt the need to deal with rough play, because when another dog has had enough they will end play or show that they don't appreciate it.

Before he approaches or is to be approached by a person or dog, have him sit and be calm before interacting. This can be practiced with a sit stay at the door before going in or out, and having him always sit an stay when talking with someone at the door.

Tell people not to pay attention to him for the first few minutes so he doesn't get too excited, then once he is calm they can pet him.

Off leash training is difficult, time consuming and takes a lot of patience. But you should focus more on leash since most cities have leash laws. A lot of his reaction will be based on yours, if you stay calm he will more likely stay calm, and if he starts pulling toward a dog don't give in or panic, just pull him out of sight of the other dog and continue your walk, eventually he will learn becoming frantic won't get him anywhere!

"ckiyhnq","&gt;Yeah, if you think the book is unoriginal then I'd like to know what works you're basing that off of.

He bashes us over the head with Fillory, a land children go to and are thrown out by deities at the end of the book, and when they get too old, are told by said deities that they are too old to return. Fillory is part of multiple universes, but to get there you first go to an in-between place by means of a magical artifact. However, using this magical artifact is an anomaly because you're usually called to Fillory by its deities when the land has need for you. The in-between place is very restful, and all the universes can be accessed by bodies of water with each body of water representing a unique universe. This in-between place is paved, but in its original form was a wood.

"cjraeen","Vicious but reasonable.  After making an example of a few cities they Mongols would roll up to a new siege, announce that they would very much appreciate the immediate and unconditional surrender of the city, and their usual terms would apply:  death to the relatively few elite leaders, to be replaced by Mongol appointed administrators (often from other conquered cities). The rest of the populace goes about their business, paying tax to the Mongols (generally just a re-allocation from the previous tax lords). 

Some cities spurned this offer.  They were destroyed to the last inhabitant. Many accepted, going so far as to toss the heads of the leaders over the wall as a token of good faith.  These cities generally did pretty well for themselves.

"cjjtx0r","I'll run down my collection for anything appropriate...

**Caylus** is an intense, zero-entropy (after set-up) eurogame that I feel plays very well across its 2-5 player count. It's a longer one, particularly when learning or with more players, but I fully expect two players to be able to finish a game in your 60-90 minutes once they're familiar with it. Worker placement cube pushing at its finest. There is a ""screw you"" mechanic in the provost, but that's more about adding a risk-taking element to the game than anything else, and progress is never lost once established. Caylus is one of the great board games everyone should play unless they're *sure* it's not for them, with very, very long legs in terms of developing skill.

**Dominion** is a game about altering the contents of your deck on the fly to maximize its turn-by-turn effectiveness as you race to grab up a limited VP pool. It does have attack cards that can be downright vicious, but many people already opt not to play with those and without those there's only very limited player interaction. While strongest at three players, two player works out quite well, too, especially with the Dominion: Prosperity expansion. Competitiveness can be an issue with this game when one player in a group works out the strategies before the others, an effect magnified at two players. Still, a very excellent game that'd be worth playing to see if you like it. Strategy runs fairly deep, on par with Race for the Galaxy, with lots of variance between plays - especially with expansions. The luck element is usually minor and largely in your control, but the occasional bad shuffle does happen.

**Evo** is a cute auction game about genetically modifying dinosaurs to maintain a larger population than your opponents. Plays great across its 2-5 player count, especially with a two player variant to the auction rules you can find online. There's a lot of indirect competition for space on the board, and some direct combat that does remove pieces, but largely it's about smart positioning on a shifting landscape and smart bidding to help you manage that. A beautiful and immediately fun game with great production values, lighter and easier to learn but still rewarding of skilled play. I think it's about 30 minutes for two players, and can easily be shortened if desired. Luck is a small but present influence.

**Expedition: Northwest Passage** is a tile-laying race and exploration game for 2-4 in the far north Atlantic. You gather VPs by visiting special locations on tiles the players put down, by getting to the northwest passage on the other side of the board, and by returning safely home - which you also must do by the end of the last round or you freeze and die. All player interaction is indirect, and with two players there's enough room on the board to support non-interactive play if you seek it out. I haven't played this one enough to know how deep the strategy goes, particularly for two players, but so far it's very engaging. There's luck involved at times when you need specific tiles (Carcassone placement rules apply), but generally that's open information and a decision to play risky or safe. Stellar production values and neat mechanics.

**Myrmes** is a lovely little empire building game, one of those that ends a turn before you were really onto something. Manage an ant colony! Make nurses, workers, and soldiers; expand your surface networks to forage for food and destroy other insects; develop your colony to improve the quality of your ant-life; show off your accomplishments to demonstrate your superiority; desperately try not to starve when winter comes around! Thematically rich and strategically varied, great from 2-4 players. There's minor player interaction in terms of area control and getting there first, and while you can take out some of your opponent's network it is rather expensive to do so. I think it's about 30 minutes per player once you're up to speed. Entropy is limited to set-up and the season mechanic, which can be mitigated by spending a resource.

**Thebes** is a much lighter archaeology game all about time management. You have 156 weeks (in two player) to work with; use them to gather information about the regions, discover invaluable cultural artifacts for prestige, rip them from their homeland so you can put on exhibition, and give lectures so everyone knows how smart you are (even if you're not). The novel mechanic here is that everything costs time, and if you spend a big chunk of it your opponents get free access to whatever opportunities arise while you're busy. There's a very noticeable random element in drawing tiles from the bags when you go to dig up artifacts, and in what cards show up when, which keeps the game light. This is more a tactical than strategic game, mostly about seizing opportunities as they come. Great fun for 2-4, plays in 45 minutes or so. 

**Ticket to Ride** is a light and instantly approachable network building game. It manages to be a great game to introduce people to board games with *and* have reasonable depth of strategy. The game has a few options for two players: I highly recommend Nordic Countries, a specific stand-alone 2-3 player version, and but there's also Europe with the Europa 1912 expansion for the Big Cities of Europe variant which plays farily well with two and allows up to five - and is compatible with map expansions like India/Switzerland (I believe India would make a good two player map, Switzerland has some problems). The basic nature of the game does reward screwing over your opponents and in Nordic and India this comes up more often; Europe adds a mechanic to mitigate that danger (and rewards not having to use it). I've played Nordic Countries as two players in 15 minutes, including set up and take down time, but expecting about 10-15 minutes per experienced player is reasonable. Randomness is noticeable every turn you're taking cards into hand, but decidedly smaller than other highly approachable games like Settlers of Catan.

**Vinhos** is a very complex eurogame about winemaking that takes 45 minutes per player once you've gotten the hang of it. It's easily the busiest board I've seen, so busy my partner refuses to play it just for that. You can: establish vineyards in your choice of eight regions and improve them with wineries, cellars, and oenologists; watch the seasons on baited breath as they affect the quality of your wine; get the opinions and influence of noted wine experts; export your wine for prestige; sell your wine for money; manage your bank account and investments; attend the annual wine fair and compete with the others on a totally arbitrary grading scale with biased judges that care about what friends you have; bribe judges with wines they love to get favors and point multipliers! Seriously involved, but once you've jumped into the cold water you feel fine. Player interaction is entirely indirect, the luck is limited and significantly signalled.

"cjecrt1","Scariest thing....okay, it had to be when my family moved into a really old farmhouse dating back to the 1860s. We were care-taking it, so my dad, who was always really cheap, figured that doing lawn work and tending to the house was going to be a lot cheaper than paying rent every month. Not so. As soon as we moved in, everything started to fall apart. Mold was seeping in through the walls and it had this musty old scent to it. At some point, the whole basement flooded. There were two bathrooms, but one was just too disgusting in the basement and could barely be used and the other one was on the first level, small, and sort of dingy. Worst place I figured I had moved to, considering we were such a big family. This house was on a lot of land that stretched back into the forest and even up a mountain. Sometimes, the dogs would run and go barking at the treeline and every single time my dad would investigate, nothing. I don't know if you have ever heard a dog bark in a vicious, but panicked way, but it gets your attention quickly. It wasn't a ruckus sort of barking, but the wolf part of them coming out. Anyway, there were three bedrooms upstairs. Really creepy and dark and tilted. The first night I was scared so my sister let me put my cot in her room and just crash there for the night. At some point I woke up and heard loud stomping on the stairs. I figured it was one of our dogs, but the stairs were hardwood and you would have heard the tapping of the dogs nails on the floor. These were like heavy work boots. The creepy thing was that this did not last for five minutes. It went on for about four hours STRAIGHT, never stopping, up and down the stairs, and then it just stopped towards dawn. I brushed it off. Old house, creepy stuff happens. I wasn't going to freak myself out over it. So about a couple of months pass and nothing happens. Well, one night I'm in my big, tall, heavy iron-framed bed, about to go to sleep, and my dog, who is sleeping with me on the bed, starts growling at something underneath it. I am thinking, great, one of the cats have gotten in here, now I'll have to spend the next hour coaxing it out from under the bed. But I am not stupid. I've seen horror movies. You don't get on your hands and knees and peer under the bed, you don't stay on your bed and peer under the bed, so I walked all the way across my room and bent down, still standing, and peeked. As soon as I did, the frame of my bed slid across the room about a good inch. I freaked out. I ran downstairs and pulled my parents up to my room, and even my dad had to admit it had to move because there was fresh marks of where it moved. The creepy thing was that with the movement, it looked like it had actually been picked. Up. and moved an inch from the bottom part of the frame. So it made my bed look slanted. I figured gravity--I honestly tried to rationalize it, but that bed frame was real, heavy old iron. My dad couldn't even manage to pick it up. Especially with my thick mattress and box spring? No fudging way. Months passed, nothing happened, and I pushed the memory away and managed to gain some calmness about things. Eventually, time came about five months later and we were preparing to move. That's when everything crazy started to happen. All the time, it sounded like someone had taken a big box of glass and shoved it down the stairs. We checked everywhere to see if things had been pushed over or messed with, and everything was in its perfect place as usual. Shadows, creaking, loud noises--I mean, it was chaotic. At some point, my mom was in her room and heard clear as day, ""Mommy."" Creepy! At another point, I was in the shower and I felt something take its finger and drag it down my whole back! I never said anything because I figured no one would believe me and left it to my own imagination, though I still wonder if it was real or not, because it certainly felt real at the time. I was in the middle of the shower, too, so I couldn't have touched anything. The cabinet doors in the bathroom would also open up most of the time if you were in the shower or bathtub. It was very scary and I am glad we are away from that place. It was like no light could ever get in that house. Anyway, that's the scariest thing that I have experienced--living in that house. The place still creeps me out by just thinking about it. All big and looming--it always managed to cast its own shadow. I still to this day have no idea what happened in that house or what could have caused it. Part of me wants to say ghosts, aliens, supernatural, whatever you want to call it, but the other part of me wants to deny all of it, and I know I can't because others experienced things in that house, too.

"cj8ku4u","Sure. Obvious spoilers though.

1. **How the story is framed to emphasize its message to the audience.** Both in the very beginning of the game and in its marketing, the game presents itself as a run-of-the-mill modern military shooter. If you didn't know anything about the game prior to playing it, nothing really jumps out at you to hint at its true nature, though in hindsight things like the ""The Line"" subtitle and the picture of an eroding man on the cover art subtly foreshadow what the game actually turns out to be. It gets people into the mindset that this game will be just another one all about ""harmless"" violence and killing tons of people to an obviously psychopathic extent but which is ignored in terms of protagonist morality. It's also interesting to note that the enemies of the game primarily consist of ""rogue"" American soldiers later on, but start out with a seemingly typical ""foreign brown people"" archetype at the very beginning to perhaps underline how modern military shooters tend to be kind of racist in their portrayals of antagonists.

2. **Instead of some stupid ""morality meter"", this game includes better and grayer examples of moral choices that aren't just the more common Messiah vs. Satan. Bonus points for having those choices enacted through mechanics rather than mere menu dialogue choices or something to that effect.** Instead of showing ""good"" vs ""evil"" points or something to that effect like many other games, this game seems to let you judge for yourself whether the actions you committed are justified or not. It's very interesting to note that the ""vicious but convenient"" option at these moments is almost always the more obvious choice compared to the ""more peaceful but also more obscure"" option or options. How many people figured out by themselves that you can shoot into the air to scare away the crowd when the game seems to be heavily implying you have to actually shoot *at* them? How many games even permit shooting into the air as an option that works? One of the most interesting clearly scripted moral choices in the game is when you have to ""pick"" which of two people to punish. The game seems like it's forcing you to kill one or the other, but you can actually start shooting at the nearby enemies instead. Of course, it's very likely that *both* hostages will die due to that choice, so even if you didn't personally pull the trigger you still have to question whether or not it was the ""right"" choice.

3. **Some mechanics and details change as Walker gets more mentally unhinged as the story progresses.** The most obvious examples of this are the melee executions and the banter Walker and the squadmates have with each other. At the beginning of the game, both executions and statements are fairly professional and detached. Around the mid-point, you can clearly see and hear how everyone in the squad is getting angrier and more violent. Towards the end, executions and statements get unnecessarily brutal and vulgar, to the point where once efficient executions can become just outright cruel overkill to emphasize just how much Walker has lost his mind and dehumanized his enemies. There are also more subtle details, some of which I'm not even entirely sure were purposeful. What likely was purposeful was stuff like Konrad's face appearing on billboards and background elements even before he's really introduced in the story (sometimes even changing depending on where you view those details from), suggesting that various things with Konrad certainly are or at least could be made up in Walker's mind. Potentially less purposeful things are the mannequins. At one point in the game it seems Walker is pretty clearly hallucinating mannequins, even going to the extent of shooting at them or dehumanizing actual people to the point that they look like mannequins to him. After that clear hallucination, there are other points in the game where you see large and unusually placed collections of mannequins, hinting at further hallucinations and dehumanization and mental insanity themes.

4. **Unscripted (?) moments can reinforce the story too.** While many of the ""big"" parts of the story clearly have some scripting going on, there are other little moments that inadvertently or purposefully can reinforce the story's themes through mechanics. Two examples come to mind. The first is that, at least once (but IIRC it happened a few times) you come across a place where there are tons of already dead people but one person barely hanging on. Unlike various other moral choices that are tied to achievements, this example is not tied to any achievement and has no real effect on the story either. You could ignore the obviously suffering person amongst the pile of dead bodies, or you could shoot them to end their suffering. I found myself tending to ""mercy kill"" such suffering people when coming across them. Is it justifiable? Perhaps not, but it can kind of be the limit of your ability to ""help"" the situation when all you have is a gun and the whole world looks like a target. Another interesting moment (again, I have no idea how intentional it was) arose when I realized that it is actually possible to stealth past certain sections of the game, despite killing being seemingly damn near required in many other situations. After successfully stealthing by (this particular example comes from your first encounter with ""Juggernaut"" style enemies), it made me think about all the other times in the game when I just slaughtered my way past troops where it may have actually been possible to non-violently stealth by them. Maybe the game is designed such that it's not commonly possible, but the fact that I found even one unscripted moment where it was possible was an eye-opener to the possibility of more approaches to certain scenarios.

5. **Fourth wall manipulation.** It seems pretty obvious that some of the game's messages and themes are aimed at you, the player. Yet, never did I really feel that the game was blatantly breaking the fourth wall, because a lot of the same chastising can apply to Walker and his actions. I don't commonly see games where the story and gameplay are so tightly interwoven that the actions of the protagonist and the reactions of characters around them apply equally to player character and player themselves. Looking at stuff like Red Dead Redemption and GTA IV can show how easily ""story morality"" and ""player morality"" can diverge.

6. **How enemies are portrayed.** Besides the obvious thing that the enemies you fight are primarily other Americans, the game suggests that there is more complexity than there might seem at first glance. It seems like there are at least two ""factions"" of Americans in Dubai (possibly three if you count the CIA / external forces as another one) and they're all in conflict with each other as well as you at different points in the game. No specific race or group is portrayed as truly being ""right"", which again possibly emphasizes how many other modern military games can be racist when one side of a war is clearly being shown as ""right"" as opposed to the more likely scenario of all sides committing war crimes. Furthermore, there are suggestions that some of the Americans you fight are not really ""Konrad's rebels"" but rather another faction that split off to help the civilians stuck in Dubai. There's no question that Walker is not a ""hero"", but there are certain times in the game (even when it isn't blatant as it can be sometimes) where you and Walker seem to be making things much worse because your confusion over who are the ""bad guys"" ends up causing you to kill those who could be considered the ""good guys"" or ""lesser evil"" in the whole mess. 

7. **(Possibly) How Achievements are done.** This one I'm less certain on if it was intentional, but it seems that since the gunplay can be unfun (possibly deliberately?), achievements come across as all the more hollow and contrary to the story's message. Or are they? Maybe all the killing, *especially* the achievements involving a number of kills you're unlikely to accumulate in one run through the story, is set up on purpose to emphasize just how criticism-worthy you are as a player if you deliberately seek to kill more enemies for worthless achievement points or badges. After all the game has had to say to you, you're still killing? I feel this is reinforced by one of the multiple endings for the ""epilogue"" portion of the game. Knowing what you know by that point, it is actually possible to kill enough enemies to cause an ending (and not one in which you die) at that point, and the game seems to be making it pretty clear by then that you really should stop killing and put down your weapon, as you no longer have even the flimsiest justification at that point to continue. But you can keep killing if you wish, and you can even ""win"" by getting the ending associated with that choice.

"cj7pdl7","Magical girl anime or anime assuming the same trappings, probably for older audiences, ala Madoka:

* Lyrical Nanoha and its sequels and reworkings: a magical girl series which increasingly resembles a superpowered fighting show as it goes on. The first two TV shows ([one](http://myanimelist.net/anime/76/Mahou_Shoujo_Lyrical_Nanoha); [two](http://myanimelist.net/anime/77/Mahou_Shoujo_Lyrical_Nanoha_As)) have been reworked as films with better production values, creepier transformation sequences and some story edits ([one](http://myanimelist.net/anime/4985/Mahou_Shoujo_Lyrical_Nanoha:_The_Movie_1st); [two](http://myanimelist.net/anime/10153/Mahou_Shoujo_Lyrical_Nanoha:_The_Movie_2nd_As)).
* [Okusama wa Mahou Shoujo](http://myanimelist.net/anime/614/Okusama_wa_Mahou_Shoujo): romance story about a magical girl who's stayed in the business for too long and grown up.
* [Dai Mahou Touge](http://myanimelist.net/anime/933/Dai_Mahou_Touge): vicious but funny parody; gory and violent.
* [Uta Kata](http://myanimelist.net/anime/688/Uta_Kata): girl gets magical powers, things get increasingly nasty.
* [Figure 17](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1126): maybe not a magical girl show at all -- you could argue it's more like animated powersuit tokusatsu -- but good if you have the patience for it; it's about a withdrawn girl who has to fight toothy alien monsters. Episodes tend to have very slow first halves and action-packed second halves.

More straightforward magical girl titles: 

* [Princess Tutu](http://myanimelist.net/anime/721): a cunning fairytale about fairytales, Tutu isn't perhaps so much for children as its for everyone. Some neat uses of lighting and theatrical layouts to produce gripping ballet-dance themed battles.
* [Sailor Moon](http://myanimelist.net/anime/530/Bishoujo_Senshi_Sailor_Moon): ground zero for the magical-girl-as-super-sentai show (unless you want to invoke Cutey Honey); good fun but there's a lot of it (200+ episodes, IIRC) and a fair chunk of filler. The current remake, Crystal, will be shorter but if you ask me it lacks the original's sense of fun.
* [CCS](http://myanimelist.net/anime/232/Cardcaptor_Sakura): decent and has a fair few older fans; consistently good if not always very adventurous animation from Madhouse; slightly weird and creepy because CLAMP were involved.
* [Ojamajo Doremi](http://myanimelist.net/anime/350/Ojamajo_Doremi): solid modern take on the magical-problem-solving kind of magical girl; good fun &amp; has a lot of heart (and delicious Umakoshi character designs) but also long, aggressively high-energy and kiddy so may not be your cup of tea.
* [Heartcatch Precure](http://myanimelist.net/anime/7645): Precure is the present-day big beast of morning children's magical girl anime, and Heartcatch is the iteration which is probably the most well animated and written and most accessible to adults. Has some very solid fights and neat designs (again, from Umakoshi)

Witches:

* [Magical Girl Squad Alice](http://myanimelist.net/anime/872/Mahou_Shoujo_Tai_Arusu): inventive dragged-to-another-world story; unusual artistic choices.
* [Yoyo &amp; Nene](http://myanimelist.net/anime/15813/Majokko_Shimai_no_Yoyo_to_Nene): another dragged-to-another-world story but in the opposite direction; fine movie-level art &amp; animation.

"cil5txc","Not the priest nor Catholic, but I am currently in a seminary working on a masters and have looked at what you're asking and can give you some answer, whether you like it or not is up to you.

a)  So, the Documentary Hypothesis, eh?  Or some variation of it.  I will not say that the whole Torah was written by Moses, let alone dictated perfectly by God on top of Horeb.  I will say that Moses and the events presented in the Torah happened in some fashion, the details may be jumbled up.  The purpose of the text likely reached some conclusive finalization in its editing by the time of Ezra around 500 BCE.  Hilkiah likely giving us a more standardized form that could be easily translated to the people, but he likely did not fabricate the whole system himself, let alone Josiah's whole regime.  At least, not according to the extent that the Documentary Hypothesis posits.  All Wellhausen did was take his current amount of data and input his culture into the Late Monarchical Period, at least from the looks of it.  The late 19th Century Imperial Europe was, in the struggle to tip the Balance of Power in their favor, commandeered myths and legends in order to legitimize their actions.  The Documentary Hypothesis runs on this though each piece using their ""Torah"" to legitimize their existence, Josiah most of all.  I would say that the Book of Kings is Josiah propaganda, but Deuteronomy does not look to be the case, considering its lack of Jerusalem as anything important, which would be key to Judaic literature. 

There are plenty of views of Divine inspiration, but inspiration does not remove the politcal situation or the human footprint.  I believe it is more impressive that God doesn't just impose his word and will but works through humanity as much as possible.  That's quite humbling that he would trust us that much.

As for anachronisms, certainly those are going to exist.  The Torah and Joshua note that monuments which were set up in the narrative still stand by the time of the writing, which may have been centuries past.  They weren't writing the modern history text like we do today, but a solidification of an oral and scribal tradition to be for all the people.  Does that make the story fully false?  Maybe, maybe it doesn't.  We are not on the peak of human knowledge, but on a small stone anywhere on the mountain, too small and blind to tell the difference.  Do I chose to believe the events of the Bible occurred?  Sure, it makes the most sense.  If something else came by and made more sense, I'd probably find a way to incorporate it into my life.  Anachronisms are par for the course with oral traditions, but that does not make them worthless either.  The Bible as a whole fits in well with its context of Near Eastern Civilization, both in terms of the literature and the culture, at least as far as I can tell.  The little itches are either something we haven't discovered yet, an appeal to silence, or scribal issues, which scholars content with every day.  They do not make the Bible make less sense.

B)  I actually find all the parallel literature really cool as it makes the whole text make more sense than less.  Look at Genesis 1-11, then look at stuff like the creation myths or the Epic of Gilgamesh and you see a God who is far different than those Mesopotamian gods.  Yeah he to us today looks cruel and vicious, but he didn't flood the earth for the people who were accidents for being too loud.  The God of the Torah had a very precise and alien code of ethics, but he chose this little tribe of nobodies and called them to be in the center hub of the entire world, and he wouldn't give up on them because he doesn't give up on anyone or anything until they literally will never return to him.  

The Creation Myth (Yes, I do believe in evolution, and I would presume that the Friar does as well, as the Catholic Church holds to its veracity), fits within that whole enhancement as well, as humanity is first off the pinnacle of creation, as everything was made for us, quite unlike Marduk who slew a monster and humanity was an accident.  I would like to note that myth does not mean it didn't happen, but rather an explanation for why something is the way it is.  The Creation Myth is a story of why humans exist, which is to tend the whole thing as the stewards of the Divine.  Noah is a story of why we have rain and rainbows.  The Fall is why everything sucks, etc.  How they happened is another thing entirely.  

D)As I said, makes the most sense.  I've looked at different religions and philosophies of life and honestly, it's either this, death, or living a lie.  I'm not in it to feel better about myself or ""do good"" but because it makes the best claim and so far has successfully backed it up.  I'm still waiting to be wrong.

f)  I've read some of each of these guys.  They are great in their fields.  Dawkins on paleontology is amazing, as he is a scholar.  They, as social commentators, are right on the money.  Voltaire was quite smart in noting the stupidity of people believing that everything is perfect and never going to be bad.  Nietzsche saw the transition of culture away from god-fearing to god-loathing and understood that people will always cling to a strong protector, so it might as well be you.  Dawkins is right that a strict, ignorant Christianity is, well, stupid.  Hitchens I'm not versed on, but, if memory serves me correctly, his brother was a preacher.  Let us never stop seeing and stopping the folly of man.  God is right there behind you, even if you are ignoring him.

"cgtk23u","You're right, I'm being quite vague. Let me try to be a bit more specific.  I think whenever racism is brought up during internet discussions we tend to be all over the place because there are so many levels of racism and prejudice. 

You have the overt kind, which is usually espoused by angry, domineering, and disenfranchised segments of society (KKK, that shooter in K.C. a couple of days ago, Nazi's), then you got the religious variety (Jews vs Muslims, people who don't believe in miscegenation), the the institutional type (drug laws and the disproportionate sentencing affecting minorities more than whites), then you got the passive-aggressive type of racism (drive-by jokes, not necessarily meant to be vicious but playful observations that may bring out a subconscious level of discomfort when it comes to racial or cultural differences), then there's the type of racism that is unknowingly insensitive, which I think this video is, especially if it turns out that the university did indeed sanction this video and its contents as an outreach to prospective Asian students. If they didn't, then I'd expect more cultural and historical awareness from someone bright enough and ambitious enough to want to attend an institute of higher learning at a time when we have access to all of mankind's information in an instant. 

You need to judge a circumstance on a case by case basis. In this instance, like I said before, if this video was indeed sanctioned by an accredited university of higher learning, and it was a true attempt at a light-hearted, but serious attempt at recruiting Asia's best and brightest then you'd think they wouldn't use examples that can be considered, by most of Tulane's academic peers, as cultural caricatures of Asian culture. And anyone with a half-decent education would know all about caricatures and how they've impacted racial and multicultural dynamics throughout U.S. history. 

Bottom Line: Not a big deal, and I'm sure in the grand scheme of things we're making a mountain out of a mole hill. But this video can be considered racism at its most benign level. 

Edit: Let me say one more thing.

"cgt3mlr","Why didn't you mention the parts where money used to fall from the sky and employers wrestled each other for the opportunity of begging you to work for them? 

The year I graduated, unemployment for under-25s stood at more than 25% - *double* today's youth rate, and more than *triple* today's overall unemployment rate. This was mostly because of a vicious but ittle-remembered economic phenomenon called *stagflation* - pray you never experience it.

An OPEC embargo *quadrupled* international energy prices within 90 days, causing  massive economic convulsions worldwide. To get an idea of what that means, just imagine what would happen to the non-Alberta economy by the end of this calendar year, if oil prices were to shoot up to $450 a barrel by mid-July. 

In the case of the entry-level boomers, within just a few months, hundreds of thousands of Canadian employers reacting to the violent global economic contractions simply shut down operations and closed their doors until better times came again. And most ongoing major Canadian economic sectors capable of survival at induced-coma levels - mining, forestry, manufacturing, shipping, transportation, banking, tourism, entertainment, farming, food processing and so on -  instituted massive layoffs to cope with a sudden worldwide shrinkage of demand for their commodities, services and goods. Guess which generation was first to get the boot? 

And because inflation was running at 14% per annum, the $7 an hour job you might have been lucky enough to retain in January only gave you $6 in purchasing power by December, and $5 by the end of the following year! Then to top it all off, the Canadian dollar lost more than 25% of its exchange value within a matter of months and wallowed in the ""remaindered currency"" bin for years - so guess what happened to the price of imported goods, *including* the nation's food supply, which was then mostly imported from the US and Mexico?


And while urban housing prices were comparatively lower, boomers certainly did not have access to the almost-free money that has now been available to prospective homebuyers for nearly a generation. A mortgage could only be had if you were lucky and stable enough to qualify for (and were willing to pay) interest rates of *18% to 22%.* Which meant by the time your five year mortgage came up for renewal, not only had your purchase price *been effectively doubled*, but your investment was seriously underwater, and you had none of today's guarantees of capital appreciation. Further, there was virtually NO new housing built for nearly a decade; one year, *across the entire nation* there were only 35 new houses built for every 10,000 people! Just imagine for a moment how that affected the prices you claim in hindsight were so favourably ""low"" - just 7 new homes built, for every *200* new people entering the housing market, *over an entire year*... ""cheap"" housing? hardly.

Even scenes at first I didn't like, such as Daryl telling Rick Beth is ""just gone"" I think I appreciate more now. I just wrote in a different thread why I think it was actually somewhat realistic and a powerful scene. 

Rick was awesome. It is interesting how this new dark side will coincide with his views during episode 8, when he says ""we all get to come back."" I think he knows now how vicious he will have to be to protect Carl and the others, but he will still want to keep his humanity. I think Andrew Lincoln said somewhere Rick is in a stronger psychological place than ever before, so this should be good to see.

To make things even more interesting I think Carl will be going through a similar struggle. After the horrible thing that almost happened to him he too I imagine will become more ruthless and vicious. But at the same time he is also scared that he is also one if the ""monsters."" It seemed like he was somewhat pleased when Rick slaughtered the guy who was holding him down (obviously understandable) and I think he is also worried he could lose his humanity. On another note, the scene with him and Michonne right before they entered Terminus was some of the best acting I have seen from him.

Its good to see most of the group back together, and to have Rick and Abraham finally meet.

"cgi0xuc","nah its just a metaphor. often these types of symbols can help form new internal structures.

if i tell you ""I am a doctor, you have depression, its a chemical imbalance, take these"" it invokes the nocebo process, it reinforces your ""illness"" and moves it outside your locus of control.

A metaphor like ""the blue wolf"" whether from a recognised heritage or simply made up by a person for their own needs can be very useful, for a few reasons.

firstly signals a shared subjectivity - its short hand empathy. Rather than using a thousand words to describe how their internal perception of a low mood is similar to your internal perception of a low mood, its captured quickly and poetically in the image of the blue wolf - in me invoked a sense of something powerful, vicious, but also comfortable in its environment, maybe even single minded. This correlates well to the depth and character of some of my low moods. It felt familiar even though its an alien concept.

Secondly this metaphor gives the low mood a purpose, or at least a reason for existing. If we go back to the medical context of a low mood - ""you are ill"" doesn't lead to any self discovery. However, lets say your low mood is caused by an incongruency in your life - lets say something simple, you work in in an abbatoir. At first you didnt care too much about the animals, but now you may feel that actually you have a new respect for them.

(*disclaimer - i'm not a veggie) 

This can cause an internal conflict. The conflict can be complex, because your logical mind is saying ""I never used to care"" while your heart or subconscious is saying ""well i do now"" - this kind of conflict is an internal incongruency and something which may well cause you to be listless &amp; low.
The metaphor of the blue wolf hints at taking an internal journey, one where you listen to yourself &amp; become aware of your incongruency. You may still choose to do nothing about it, but at least you are aware.

For me my incongruency was to keep drinking &amp; partying long after I was interested in it. I felt torn, habit &amp; my logical mind &amp; lack of courage kept agreeing to invitations to nights out, while inside my heart had grown tired of it - this manifested itself in a low mood. A little bit of meditation, a break from drinking &amp; eating a bit better was enough to change the mood - in the usage of the metaphor the blue wolf had forced me to look at my life &amp; recoginise the conflict.


This isn't new age nonsense, its just the usage of metaphors and symbols to help understand your internal make up.

"cfsilvt","That's the genius of representative democracy. Administration n can do something utterly amoral and it it doesn't work out Administration n+1 can denounce it. And then country is blameless.

You could see it with South America. A bunch of administrations backed authoritarian anti Communist regimes in the Cold War. Then Communism collapsed and the US nudged them all to democratise. And then later on said it was wrong for previous administrations to have done that. But guess what - Chile, El Salvador et al are only democracies now because those authoritarians stomped the Communists. If the Communists had won they wouldn't not have democratized later even after the USSR collapsed - e.g. see Cuba.

El Salvador is a particularly wonderful case. The US State Department backed the constitutional right wing parties and the CIA covertly backed the death squads. Finally when the death squads had crippled the FMLN. The CIA switched its backing to the Jose Napoleon Duarte's Christian Democrats and the State Department denounced D'Aubuisson as a murderer and stopped his Arena party winning elections. Now both the FMLN and Arena are constitutional parties. 

Representative democracies really are amoral rather than immoral. Beyond good and evil in a Nietzschean sense, even though neither the representatives nor the electorate look at the world in such a cynical way.

I suppose another way to look at it is that the amoral but optimal policy is an [emergent behaviour](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergence#Emergence_and_evolution) - e.g. with El Salvador the State Department and CIA/Army did genuinely disagree on who should be supported - the somewhat moral but powerless Duarte or the vicious but powerful D'Aubuisson in order to stop the pro Russian FMLN. That disagreement led to them gradually switching support from D'Aubuisson to Duarte in a way that only a really Machiavellian ruler could have done.

"cei4xyy","You are NOT a selfish asshole. And your dad does sound a bit like he has Narcissistic Personality Disorder (NPD).

Ns typically use their offspring and partners as ""Narcissistic Supply"" (google it). If he truly has NPD, he actually believes that your (and your brothers') purpose in life is to reflect well on him. Sometimes that takes the form of him pushing you into certain things and taking credit for your achievements. Other times it means belittling you to ensure you never compete, and make him look better by comparison. That sounds like your case.

If he's truly NPD, he's not doing it because he's insecure. He's not doing it because he's miserable and hurting. He's doing it because he cannot empathize with you, or see you as something that has feelings and can be hurt. He sees you as a tool, *his* tool, and when you are out of sight he probably ignores you; when you look bad (according to him) he abuses you; when you look good (if ever) he steals credit for himself.

Your shame at this--forgetting the reason for his anger, apologizing for posting, your habit of staying out of his way--this feeling he put in you. He trained you from birth (partially through your mother) that he was right, that you truly were to blame when he yelled, that you were worthless and  nobody would care for you but him. It is NOT integral to you. It is NOT true emotion. It is what he gave you, because he is toxic. He gave it to you because he wants to control you, so you keep supplying his vision of himself as good.

Children naturally believe their parents are right and good, and many studies have shown they blame themselves for their parents' problems. Money, relationships, family--whatever the problems, children will blame themselves. Your father exploited this by his abuse. You are a survivor, not a cause.

You don't want him to have any hold on you when you get away. No shared leases, bank accounts, anything. Third, consider going NC when you can. That is the only solution for such a toxic person.

"cdxwmx9","Evil can function within a good group.  The problem is a lot of players seem to think of evil as cartoon villanry or murderous Psychopaths.  Yes, the Joker is evil.  However, [Deadpool](http://villains.wikia.com/wiki/Deadpool) is also evil.  Deadpool is a mercenary famous for his moral flexibility.  If you pay him to do a job clean, making sure no one gets killed, he'll do it.  If you pay him to burn down an orphanage while mocking the children inside, he'll do it.  He can land on the side of the good guys because he feels like it would be fun.

So you need to hammer out how your character is evil.  Your god choice is tricky because he is not entirely a practical evil god  Perhaps he should just plain enjoy hurting and killing people and he sees this adventure as a way to indulge his violent nature without having to deal with the problems being a full on psychopath brings.

When the good players threaten you, throw it right back in their face.  Make them question their goodness.  Play the ""we're not so different card.""  Point out that they jumped right to trying to kill you, heck even dare them to do it.  Have your character drop his weapons, give them his best ""come at me bro"", and dare them to strike you down where you stand.  Ask them what their god would think of them trying to kill an unarmed man, tell them they would make a good disciple Nerull, tell them you see them for what they really are, tell them you would be happy to die to deliver a new convert for your god.  Let them you that you are at least honest about your nature.  Remind them that they need you.

Your goal should be to cruel, vicious, but effective.  Your methods are dirty, but you get results.  You should also try to make some friends in high places so there are consequences to taking you out.  When they finally do kill you, it should be a spiral of chaos that costs them their good alignments.

Challenge their goodness.  Don't let them play the ""I'm a good guy, I can do whatever I want, because evil"" themselves.

Remember, an evil character requires good RPing and not every DM or player can keep up with it.  It requires understands the shades, understanding motivations, and some players prefer the simpler ""Good smites evil, because evil is evil and good is good.""  Meanwhile you should be pushing the aspect that those who indiscriminately smite evil and no different than the evil the smite.  There is a good chance your character will end up dead, but enjoy the ride and make sure it is in a spectacular fashion.",1386641494,"your goal should be to cruel, vicious, but effective.","vicious, but effective","vicious","but",TRUE,"vicious , but effective","effective",NA,NA,1

"cdvy5sf","Takeaway points:  

- 9 goals in 2 games!
- 2nd place! 
- 83' goal should go to Suarez. o'Brien touched it, but it wasn't his fault it went in. 
- Skrtel. 3 OGs in 3 games. He played well today and at Hull, but this must be noted. Might be a record.
- Sakho started. Sakho scored. Sakho played great defense. I cheered louder for his sliding interception than I did for any of the goals.
- Seems that we either score in the first 3 minutes, or we concede possession in our half for the first 15. We need more consistency from kickoff. 
- Panicked when Hendo went down with Gerrard already out. I know we lack midfield depth, but to lose two starters? Terrifying.
- What did Gerrard whisper to the trainer as he went off?
- Finally a non-controversial red card. Not hugely vicious, but very irresponsible. 
- Credit to Michael Oliver. We hate on refs on bad days, but never pay respect on good days.   
- 3 OGs is a bizarre game. If this was a 2-0 game, we would be disappointed. 
- I really, really, REALLY thought Luis wold have a second hattrick. I saw it on his face too.  

I think overall we should have played much better against such a weak team, but I can't complain with the results. The same problems that have been mentioned all year were evident today (lack of depth, weak midfield, odd defense situation), but the final score makes it easy to forget about that. Our most important game coming up is not Spurs, City, or Chelsea, but the transfer window.

"cdmm732","Gronk is an athletic freak that is too fast for your standard linebacker and too tall/strong for your standard corner.

There are other athletic freaks like this too that become Pro-Bowl TEs, but I think what sets Gronk apart is that he has the perfect balance between speed and strength. Many other great TEs are freaks on the speed side, so they are effectively gigantic receivers. But the thing is, everybody knows that they are gigantic receivers and that is how they will cover them (ex: Belichick putting Talib on Jimmy Graham or double covering Tony Gonzales). The problem with defending Gronk is that he is probably the best blocking TE in the league, as well as being a really good receiver. Most people look at his offensive numbers (yards and TDs), when his greatest strength might actually be his blocking.

Good defenses will try to force you to play your weakest role, but Gronk doesn't have a weak role. He'll happily let your best coverage guys hover around him while he destroys the defensive line and open up mismatches elsewhere. That is why Gronk will often seemingly disappear from the receiving game (he might get 1 target in an entire half), and other players are getting big plays. The Panthers defensive line is absolutely vicious, but last week the Pats were able to run the ball straight down the field cause Gronk just cleared the way with his blocking (I didn't think that the Pats would be able to run it that easily). He even blocked the nose tackle successfully in one play. If you want a guy to catch the ball, Jimmy Graham or Vernon Davis are probably better at doing it, but the defenses know that and they'll play them that way. Gronk is the more deceptive TE because of his blocking ability, and when Brady runs no huddle to prevent substitutions and he can audible to switch Gronk's role at any moment, it is simply a nightmare to defend against.",1385393269,"the panthers defensive line is absolutely vicious, but last week the pats were able to run the ball straight down the field cause gronk just cleared the way with his blocking (i didn't think that the pats would be able to run it that easily).","vicious, but last","vicious","but",TRUE,"absolutely vicious , but last","last","absolutely",NA,1

"cdamjlc","Eve is probably the greatest working economic simulation in any video game ever (im sure there are better computerized economic simulators out there but they likely aren't in games and they definitely arent in MMOs). The vast, vast majority of all goods consumed by players are made by other players. For me to get into a ship and fit it for PvP, many things happen and many players make those things happen.

The miner mines minerals. He sells them to the industrialist who, using blueprints, builds a ship and a bunch of modules. He places them for sale on the market, they are bought and moved and sold and re-sold by traders until I (the consumer) set my eye upon them and purchase them. I then hire a freighter pilot to move them to a more convenient location in high security space where I then ask a friend who has a jump freighter to jump them over to our staging system in the middle of a war in null security space. That night I kill a bunch of bad guys and eventually I get blown up during an enemy bombing run. Now I, and many others, need new ships and the cycle starts over.

***Deus Kuruske***

Then show me...""Arrancar""...

*As Akairo sends his flurry of jabs with his spear Deus backs up as he comes getting in a ready defensive stance and starts to take on Akairo's strikes with his daichi and his arms which looks something like [this](http://images2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20120506185516/dragonball/images/9/98/Tumblr_lyr9gkpYgw1r6yetao4_500.gif). Akairo's strikes are quick and vicious but Deus' defense was quicker and fluid. He could feel the abhorrence that Akairo held for him through his strikes almost as if he was talking through his spear, Deus revels in this as he does the death dance with him. The sparks fly off at the clash of their weapons like fireflies and the sound can be heard by anyone a fair distance away. Even Anya could hear if she tried, a few of Akairo's strikes find their mark grazing him on his forearms a shoulders a few times. Deus didn't care, pain made everything better. As Akairo sends his shot for Deus' eyes, Deus just moves his head to the right and parries Akairo's spear upward breaking his heated flow and throwing him off balance. As as a counter, he uses Kinetic Ager to send Akairo flying like [this](http://stream1.gifsoup.com/view6/3435499/nsuns2-almighty-push-o.gif) (It basically is an Electric Almighty Push except where as Pain forces it out, enemies only get send flying backwards if they are within range of Deus) as he comes into contact with the field of deadly electric energy. Now that he has some distance Deus some of the blood off his shoulder and licks it, so Akairo wanted to see him release huh? Can't keep the man waiting!*

Ask and ye shall receive sinner...

*He then raises his daichi high in the air as he grins widely and out of nowhere storm clouds start to appear*

***Begone....with the thunderclap!!!***

*As he says this, Deus is struck with a giant black lightning bolt strikes him surging into his body. As this happens, Deus becomes considerably taller to a height of 7'3"" and his hair grows longer to drape past his shoulders. His body mass and size takes a dramatic increase and his skin turn into a combination of black and blue colors as his skin becomes transparent. His face then takes a skeletal appearance and his eyes become pitch black. Electricity flows in, out and around his body in this form and he's even faster in this form as a black smoky aura emits from him. He now sounds like five men talking simultaneously ([his appearance](http://images.wikia.com/bleach-rp/images/0/07/Water_and_Lightning_God_by_RyManz.jpg)).

"cchopdr","You think so? I've heard that each time you go through withdrawals (again), it gets worse each time.

I've been through Oxy withdrawal once or twice, and it's quick and very vicious, but H just seems to take a whole new toll, mentally. Mentally, it feels more draining, and it seems to last forever. When I come down, there's this heavy depression and apathy on top of the physical lack of energy, accompanied with major cravings. I never used to get it that bad with Oxy, at least I think. H is not to blame here, I think. It's probably just that it's more potent, and I'm doing more of it. The physical dependency has gotten worse?

When I was doing Oxy, I would eat anywhere from 60mg to 80mg for a good buzz. 80mg-100mg would have me soaring. I also like the ""speedy"" productive energy from Oxy. It's very pushy, compared to H, which can feel very underwhelming, most of the time.

This H connect I've had lately, the H is very strong. When I first switched over, only 10-20mg got me high as fuck. Since then, I've been doing 20mg in each nostril, repeatedly, usually a few times over, until I am good. I even took up vaping it (#4, so I mix with caffeine powder). With enough at my disposal, I'll keep going all day/night until I run out. I'll even try to save a bump for the next day to get out of bed and get my day going, but I am usually too greedy. I will spend the next day or two lying in bed and doing fuck all, not eating, not showering, not seeing a point in anything. It sucks.

The cravings, the withdrawals, the days in between, it just seems very, very hard compared to Oxy. Maybe it's just because with Oxy, it's a controlled dosage, usually a one time thing, then you're out of pills. Whereas with H, you have multiple doses, and it's easy to get carried away, or go pick up more. I guess I don't have that level of self control.

I don't want to switch back because of the ""stigma"", because I don't really believe in that. I want to switch back purposely because of my lack of self control. H is too easily available, too cheap, and too plentiful. Constantly redosing whenever I feel like it, it just seems to add insult to injury.

Perhaps you're right. H isn't to blame here, it's the frequency of use. Maybe I should just limit myself to only picking up 2-3 points a week at most, or just quit altogether.

I am moreso curious as to, say, if I need 20-50mg of quality H to get a buzz going, is 80mg of Oxy going to give me a buzz? Or will I need more time.. or more Oxy?

Codex Alera series by Jim Butcher read by Kate Reading.  Fantasy series, great narration.  Some of the politics is similar to GoT but not so vicious but complex characters no elves or fairies, and great military battles.

Get ALL the Neil Gaiman books.  His audio books, especially read by him are just fantastic.

Outlander series by Diana Gabaldon had won awards for its audio book.  Not quite high fantasy, it's a WWI nurse time travels back several hundred years in Scotland and had to deal with politics life etc.  great historical novel, a bit smutty but yeah.. That's a plus to me.

Hunger Games is a great series on audio book.

His Dark Materials is unique in that it is done as an audio drama with different actors for each characters voice.   Very high production value.

Harry Potter might be the best done series around on audio book.  There are two versions and both have points.  Jim Dale has a record for most unique voices in an audio book, and Stephen Fry is just so cozy how he reads.  Unmatched for great readings.

I love audiobooks!  Nothing wrong with using this as a medium to ""read""/""listen"" to books.  I used them to commute for years.  Now I work out to audiobooks.

Now, there is a difference. Chinese workers are busting their asses, to get the deposit. Without the incentive of further price rises, they'll stop working so hard for a deposit. Why bother, if owning property is a bad idea?

So they'll work less hard, and spend their money on consumption. That might be good, in a way - China can finally grow its consumption. But it's not good if Chinese workers don't really want to work.

Hehe...I feel so conflicted about this show. I was so awfully against this show when we got the season PVs in Spring. I *Knew* that the ""au contraire"" anti-4chan hype was not going to last. I knew the majority of the people who supported it as ""fan service for the other side"" were not going to be interested in it. 

I want to be so smug about Free!, so condescendingly smug but....I started watching it last week and I can't stop... It's...just so much camp. The camp....god I love it!!! The swimsuits, the glistening muscles and sweat....all of it is still supremely hilarious to me.

 4-chan seems to have done a 180 about the show. Last week I saw a  100+ NSFW post of the guys jam-hammering it. I mean, its not especially normal but these *were* the guys who were ready to burn Kyoto-Ani for dare making something besides cute girls doing cute things.

"cc7avkm","Dammit, Garlock, *now?* I'm in my cups, man. Alright, this is gonna be a little off the cuff.

**Still Watching Because They Are The Best Shows Of The Season**

- Monogatari S2

Not much to say that hasn't been said on Monogatari, though I think this has actually easily been the strongest set of the series so far. It's still got fantastic, inventive direction, it's still got beautiful visual design, and it's still got convoluted but ultimately very thematically cohesive, character-oriented exorcism stories. With the exorcisms being a metaphor for emotional problems and... well, if you're watching this show, you know the gist. We need more shows that try this hard.

- Gatchaman Crowds

Definitely the most thematically dense show of the season. I originally thought this was going to be a stylish, winking takedown of sentai tropes, but it turned out to be something much more ambitious - an *incredibly* stylish exploration of crowdsourcing, the nature/necessity of leadership, and the validity of identity in the internet age. The protagonist Hajime is essentially a genre-impervious wrecking ball, dashing through classic story conventions and scrapbooking her way to a new world order. It is very rare to see a show this smart maintain such a sense of fun. Pretty much a must-see.

- Uchouten Kazoku

And here's the heavyweight. I think both of the shows above will rightly appear on numerous best-of lists for the year, but for me, there is no comparison. Uchouten Kazoku is gorgeous, Uchouten Kazoku is deftly written, Uchouten Kazoku is personal, Uchouten Kazoku is true. Early on, its aesthetic was compared to Ghibli films, which makes sense - it effortlessly exudes both Ghibli's appreciation of natural beauty and Ghibli's mastery of magical realism, wherein fantastical elements are grounded in utterly believable human emotions, making them all the more fantastical. But this is so much more than that - while exploring resonant issues of family and the meaning of life (seriously, one of its central themes is the definition of a life well-lived), it constantly builds to those moments which define living, the moments where every anxiety quiets and every nerve sings and the world is just *right* for a second. And it's pretty hard not to fall in love with its achingly human cast, or its sonorous interpretation of Kyoto. Yeah, I'm gushing. I have a right. This is one of my favorite shows of all time.

**Still Watching Because They're Still Fine Television**

- The World God Only Knows Season 3

This season, TWGOK has stepped up from ""comedy I feel kinda guilty about enjoying but hey it's got such witty comments about anime archetypes how could I not enjoy it"" to ""holy shit this show can build a moment of emotional truth,"" which in my mind is about seven hundred steps worth of improvement. This season has improved in every way over the first two, being funnier, better paced, more ambitious, and infinitely more emotionally affecting. I feel confident saying TWGOK is some fine goddamn television, and that if you appreciate anime and things that are funny you should probably be watching this show.

- C3-bu

OUT OF NOWHERE. I dropped this show at episode 3, but then picked it up again because people said 4 was amazing. It was! Then the next few weren't. I dropped it again at 8, because eh, I just don't have enough time for a sometimes interesting but generally by-the-numbers sports drama. How wrong I was! I've picked it up again, and I've picked it up to stay. C3-bu has basically continued to dance on the periphery of my expectations, but its one stable throughline was the excellent character drama of its protagonist Yura, and the show has very fortunately decided to hone in on that. In its final act, it's become an actually very sensitive psychological drama that still manages to play off sports genre tropes in a very entertaining way. It's basically the ragged challenger, continuously limping back into the ring for one more round with the big dogs. It's a show worth rooting for.

People tend to trot out ""human nature"" as being selfish and vicious, but they rarely take a step back and look at our culture. 

Our culture is competition-based and we're literally trained since birth to be selfish and look out for ourselves; everyone else literally *is* out to get us, or at least defeat us. Want a job? You have to defeat all the others who want it. Want money? The money you get you get at the expense of someone else, somewhere down the line, etc.

Selfishness and greed is learned behavior. If we taught our children sharing instead of greed - and more importantly, had a social system where sharing was in your best interest, instead of against it like today - our world would look completely different (and have some small chance of allowing the species to survive into the future, unlike now.)

"cbm1f5l","The first thing I disagree with is your assessment of dystopia as a genre. Brave New World shows a world in which everyone is happy - and it's *horrible*. 1984 isn't about Big Government, it's about tyranny. It wasn't written to confirm anyone's prejudices, but to warn his fellow socialists against the sort of state control in the name of social justice that the Soviet Union was engaged in.

Shin Sekai Yori is not a dystopia because everyone is miserable, but because it's a society based on moral atrocity: they fear their children so much that they don't consider them human. And they extend this to the queerats.

If the queerats are culturally inferior it's because the village keeps them that way out of convenience. Why not enlighten the barbarians? Because that would mean acknowledging their humanity, which would be inconvenient.

As for characters, a lot of Saki's personality is developed by having other characters tell us what she's like. That's pretty poor writing. Does she live up to what they say? Maybe, I suppose. But would you have reached the same conclusions without what they said? I doubt it.

We just need to be involved once we elect someone.  Say what you want about the tea party, but they really influenced the health care debate following Obama's election.  What resulted was actually a compromise.  Conservatives may hate it because it now belongs to Obama, but the ACA is strangely enough a compromise piece of legislation.  I would have wanted something more like Medicare for all but their protesting made that impossible; we got a fairly conservative healthcare plan that conservative leaning Democrats were willing to support.  I may have hated the Tea Party's perspective, but their passion made me more passionate and the country was engaged.  It was messy and vicious but it wasn't passionless.

The problem right now is that we are passionate about our apathy.  We want to say ""oh fuck it they all suck.""  Barack Obama didn't turn out to be the Christ President.  He supports warrantless surveillance! So let's cry about it.  Anyone who followed Obama the senator would know that he supports that.  So let's agree that he sucks just like the rest of them and complain about him and the rest and just forget about everything else now.

And I'd also point out that the issue with civil liberties is also *our fault*: until this country agrees that ""well I'm not guilty like those Muslims are so I have nothing to worry about"" is an unacceptable position then the government will continue the spying.

"c65jxi0","&gt; You mentioned the Arab Afghans, but that kinda confuses me. The people Osama brought in weren't Afghans, that's why he had to bring them in.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghan_Arabs

&gt; Afghan Arabs (also known as Arab-Afghans) were Arab and other Muslim Islamist mujahideen who came to Afghanistan during and following the Soviet-Afghan War to help fellow Muslims fight Soviets and pro-Soviet Afghans.[1] Observers and journalists covering the war have cast doubt on their significance as a fighting force, but within the Muslim Arab world they achieved near hero-status for their association with the defeat of the militant atheist, anti-religious Communist superpower that was the Soviet Union.
&gt;
&gt; Many returned to their home countries to wage jihad against their governments. Their name notwithstanding, none were Afghans and some were not Arabs, but Turkic, Malay or from some other Muslim non-Arab ethnicity. The most famous among their ranks was Osama bin Laden.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghan_Arabs#Helpfulness_to_the_Afghan_mujahideen

&gt; Perhaps the major contribution of the more serious Afghan Arab volunteers was humanitarian aid ‚Äî- the setting up of hospitals around Peshawar and Quetta and providing funds for supply caravans to travel to the interior of the country. The effectiveness of the Afghan Arabs in Afghanistan as a fighting force has been scoffed at, called a ""curious sideshow to the real fighting,""[16] Estimates are there were about 2000 Arab Afghans fighting ""at any one time"", compared with about a 250,000 Afghan fighters and 125,000 Soviet troops.[17]
&gt;
&gt; Marc Sageman, a Foreign Service Officer who was based in Islamabad from 1987-1989, and worked closely with Afghanistan's Mujahideen, says
&gt;
&gt;&gt; Contemporaneous accounts of the war do not even mention [the Afghan Arabs]. Many were not serious about the war. ... Very few were involved in actual fighting. For most of the war, they were scattered among the Afghan groups associated with the four Afghan fundamentalist parties.[8]
&gt;
&gt; One instance where the foreign volunteers did participate in the fighting is reported to have backfired disastrously, hurting the Afghan resistance by prolonging the war against the Afghan Marxist government following the Soviet withdrawal.
&gt;
&gt; The March 1989 battle for Jalalabad, was to be beginning of the collapse of the Afghan Communist government forces, with those forces began negotiation of surrender to the native Afghan mujahideen. Unfortunately, radical non-Afghan salafists became involved, executing some 60 surrendering Communists, cutting their corpses into small pieces, and sending the remains back to the besieged city in a truck with the message that this would be the fate awaiting the infidels.[18] Despite apologies and assurances of safety from Afghan resistance leaders, the Communists ended their negotiations of surrender, spurred them on to break the siege of Jalalabad and to win the first major government victory in years. ""This success reversed the government's demoralization from the withdrawal of Soviet forces, renewed its determination to fight on, and allowed it to survive three more years.""

Let's not exaggerate.  A boxer is nowhere near as aggressive genetically as a pit bull.  It doesn't mean all pit bulls are vicious, but they are more likely to injure a person than a boxer or a golden retriever or a Dane.  They just are.  It's statistically true.  You're trying to make this an all-or-nothing issue, saying that because I (rightfully) state that pit bulls are more dangerous than most other breeds on the planet, that I'm declaring all of them dangerous.  You're misrepresenting what I'm saying because you dislike the idea that someone is saying ""pit bulls are a menace"".

Well I'm not.  I'm accurately explaining that pit bulls have more capacity to injure a person because of their jaws, and teeth, and strength, combined with a verrrrry diluted breeding for aggressiveness.  That means you're going to have more Pit Bull attacks, per 1,000 pit bulls, than for boxers.  That's just how it is.  It doesn't mean every one is dangerous.  It just means that as a whole they are _more_ dangerous than almost every other popular breed in the US.

Most Pits are loving.  Some people's Pits are loyal and loving and then one day they snap at someone and send them to the emergency room with a torn up face.  It isn't common, but it happens because their snap-bites and momentary aggression is much more potent.  My French Bulldog could be an angry, biting little demon.  He'd never send someone to the ER no matter how angry and vicious he acted, because he's not big enough and his jaw isn't the right shape, nor is it strong enough.  Almost every breed has had examples of human attacks.  Pit Bulls, unfortunately, are more likely to seriously hurt a person when they do.

If you still don't understand this and feel the need to respond explaining how most Pit Bulls are sweet, or how they're misunderstood, or how other dogs have attacked people as well, then just save yourself the time and don't bother.  If you have any response except agreement, you aren't understanding what I'm saying and are knee-jerk defending the breed as if I'm badmouthing it.  I'm not.

I came across a list of dog breeds most likely to bite recently.  I think it was from Animal Planet, but I'm not sure.  According to that list, Golden Retrievers were most likely to bite.  The reason stems from their natural instinct to retrieve, which they obviously use their mouth for.  Most bites are non-vicious, but real, regardless.

"c4m5sdj","Both my parents are class acts. They really are a standard example of people who want babies but have no idea what to do with them once they're actually here, breathing, living, and talking. My mother lied about being pregnant to trap my father. As a 23 year old woman with a five year, she told my younger sister point blank that 'she wanted to find a daddy for your sister."" My dad, blinded by her beauty and ability to drink a quart of liquor and still stand married her after a year, and eleven months later i was born. The marriage crumbled quickly, so she had my sister two years after me. We were poor before that, but with three girls shit got real.

All in all, our mother made me and my younger sister pay for our births since we were old enough to hear. Such 'burdens' and 'assholes' and simply 'mouths to feed'. She told all her friends and our family what terrible kids we were, when in actuality we had almost no supervision and tended to do not burn the house down or get into trouble. Thankfully our maternal grandparents were there, giving us the love and tenderness we lacked from our mother's incredible psychosis and our father's lack of interest in the whole 'parenting' thing since it was a 'woman's job.' Without them the two of us wonder how we would have turned out.

What really put the nail in the coffin with my mother was when I was around fourteen my dad and I were fighting a lot. My god given mouth (thanks, mom!) and natural stance of never backing down (thanks, both!) i wasn't taking shit because both of them are nuts, and didn't really pay attention to us until we were teenagers. I had a shrink, since it was the early 2000s, and she suggest a meeting with my mother. She came and I laid it out, in confidence. She told me she understood and wanted to help me. I was stupid, and I believed her. The next day she took my dad to Costco and over hot dogs and ice cream proceeded to tell him everything that I had said. They came home, and she had that shit-eating grin on her face and my dad proceeded to tell me he didn't want to talk to me ever, and that I was nothing to him. I made sure to never tell her anything like that again, and have never trusted her since.

Ten years later, I have a pretty good relationship with my dad. He's nuts, unbelievably selfish and vicious but he doesn't have bad intentions.

"c3x39xr","There are books about dinosaurs, but there are books about Jesus too!

Those countries all have big churches and lots of really good people praying, their prayer trickles down to the 99% even if they're heathens, but Africa was too lazy to build cathedrals so they don't get very good Faith Reception. (That's what the spires are for-- they channel God's Love to us from heaven.) 

Anyway...

Black People are easy to explain. Adam and Eve were white, like all normal humans, but then it came time to decide the savior of humanity. There were two choices: Jesus and Lucifer. It's actually a pretty cool story. :)

Lucifer led an army of his followers from the southern reaches; Dark-skinned, vicious creatures born from the corrupted corpses of fallen humans. They knew not love or peace, only violence and lust for blood. 

The truly faithful (disciples of Jesus) met them at a fortress on the plains of Har Megiddo, where they would do battle to decide the fate of the world.

Despite the dry climate, a massive storm had just rolled in from the Mediterranean. The sky was obscured by dark clouds. Rain fell in thick ropes, punctuated by stacatto flashes of fierce lightning, and the ominous rumble of thunder. 

The dark-skinned luciferians marched upon the keep at Har Megiddo, under a hail of arrows. Three times they approached, and each time they were driven back by the faithful. Discouraged by the fierce defense, but unable to quell their lust for blood, they tried a new tactic: A great ram was brought to the gates of the keep. They sought to batter a way in rather than brave the walls.

Thankfully, a great hero (Thaddeus, I believe) led a band of warriors out to rout the vicious but cowardly dark-skins. The keep was safe once more.

Furious, Lucifer demanded that ladders be brought, and ordered a desperate final attack upon Tel Megiddo. His men climbed the very walls meant to protect the faithful, and in the spiraling melee that followed atop the walls, the dark lord decided to unveil his secret weapon.

Forged in hellfire itself, the weapon was capable of blasting through solid stone. The device was planted at a weak spot upon the wall, a dike through which a small stream passed. With the cruel weapon in place, a Luciferian charged forth with the magic wand that would detonate it and bring hellfire to the earth.

The hero Phillip (who was a renowned archer) saw through this plan, but it was too late: Though his arrows struck true, Lucifer's foul magic was enough to keep the darkskin alive, and the weapons were detonated. The walls were lost in an instant, along with scores of brave, faithful warriors. 

The scattered and terrified faithful fell back to their last bastion of defense and begged god for mercy. They pleaded for some sort of reprieve, for their cause was just, but they were not strong enough to fend off the horde pouring through their walls and rallying for it's final victory.

Then, just as all seemed lost, Jesus appeared atop a white horse, backed by more cavalry than the faithful had ever seen. He stormed down the mountain as the clouds parted-- a sign from God himself-- and the sun shone upon the land once more.

Upon witnessing the light of Christ himself, the darkskins realized their mistake and despaired, throwing their weapons down and fleeing, as hordes were cut down by the great Cavalry of Christ.

 A few weary stragglers managed to escape that day, and in their despair all swore never to take up arms against the faithful again. They settled mostly in Africa, where their descendants were forever cursed to bear the shameful dark corruption of their ancestors, and to suffer for the sins of those who took up arms against the faithful.

And that's where black people come from. :) Uhm.. I may have gotten a couple details mixed up, it's been a looooong time since I read the Book of Mormon, but you get the idea?

His neighbors had huge dogs (I don't remember what kind) who were known to be aggressive and vicious, but they had a big chain-link fence around their backyard, so it didn't bug me too much.

My cousin and I were making mud pies or something in the dirt, when we heard some low growls. We looked up and saw the dogs staring at us through the fence. We were a little nervous, but knew they couldn't get at us, so we just kept playing. A minute or so later I heard my dad shouting, and I turned to see him running full speed down the hill toward us. He hooked his arm around my middle, grabbed my cousin's hand, and ran back up the hill. At one point he stopped for a second, but I didn't know what he was doing. When we got back up to the house he slammed the sliding glass door behind us, and I turned to see the dogs growling and barking and being generally terrifying. 

Apparently there was a gate that was left open or a hole in the fence or something and the dogs had gotten through. My dad looked out the window and saw them go through the fence, so he ran down the hill to rescue us. My mom told me that the reason he stopped for a moment as we were going back up the hill was because one of the dogs had managed to get his teeth into the hem of my jeans and was pulling on me, and my dad had to turn around and shake him off. 

Anyway, I don't remember it very much, but I'm grateful. One of the dogs ended up mauling someone a few months later, so I could have been seriously hurt. Glad I wasn't!

"c3kb07i","Well, initially when I heard they were both up for review I thought that was fine since both warranted another look and potentially supplementary discipline. 

I thought Ovie's hit was less vicious, but definitely avoidable in the sense that he didn't need to leave his skates to make a hard body check. Ovie's problem was choosing to do so. Had he not left his skates the resulting hit would have been a perfectly legal check and all contact with the head would likely have been avoided. In choosing to leave his skates the result became charge and was no longer a clean body check. The charge was a dirty play, but less vicious than his previous offenses in my opinion so I was thinking 3-4 games. That hit to a first-time offender is probably 1, maybe 2 games if anything. Also, Ovechkin's previous incidents were different plays under different circumstances so while the fact he got suspended previously still holds weight I think the act(s) he was suspended for being different also affects the decision on the length of suspension.

Michalek's was a heat of the moment type of hit and looked more dangerous with a higher potential for injury than Ovechkin's. After Ovechkin hit him and there was no call Michalek got caught up in the moment. He obviously felt there should have been a call made on Ovie and when there wasn't he went looking for his own vigilante justice. His hit on Hendricks was a byproduct of this. Michalek wanted to put a Caps player through the boards. While Hendricks did make himself more vulnerable by hunching over, Michalek could still have let up and made the play on the puck thereby avoiding unnecessarily checking a vulnerable player. He was still heated about the no-call on Ovie so he incorrectly chose to hit a player in a vulnerable position. It was a dangerous hit and he was rightfully penalized on the play, as Ovechkin also should have been penalized for charging. I say two games for a dangerous elbow from behind for a first time offender is more than reasonable.

At the end of the day they both should have been suspended for deliberately choosing an incorrect action while in the midst of play. The length of the suspensions is debatable, but I am still of the opinion that both should have been suspended regardless of length.

Despite that: I am going to say 'yes!'.

He hires evil men to do evil things in the most evil manner possible even if it's not strictly necessary...

&gt;Exactly what is the difference between a lord standing bannerman to your house that you command in war (Gregor Clegane) and another lord standing bannerman to your house that you command in war (Roose Bolton)? Also, political rival...?

Did... did you even read the books? You think Gregor Clegane and Tywin's relationship is the same as Roose and Robb's, and you don't even see how Roose Bolton is a political rival to Robb? You didn't read the books. Here is a simple analogy, Gregor is a vicious but obedient bulldog outfitted with a shock collar and monitoring device, Roose is a barely restrained monster which can shapeshift into a human to kill you and steal your job.

&gt;As for Grey Wind, it's actually more like saying setting a dog on your enemies is the same thing as setting a dog on your enemies.

So the enemies being armed and dangerous opponents as opposed to defenseless peasants and children is a meaningless distinction to you? I'm so naive for not understanding how this makes you a well-read person with a logical and nuanced understanding of the world.

&gt;In fact, he wasn't even aware Gregor was capable of such a thing until he did it, and was even surprised and a little horrified by this fact. 

What? Everyone knows Gregor is a monster. Tywin is not a complete idiot. What is this? 

&gt;As for all this drivel about Tywin advancing himself in the world (by remaining subservient to King Aerys for twenty years and then later being subservient to an oaf for fourteen more years until he's forced to intervene in a war his daughter started), what's wrong with that? I mean... isn't that what everyone is doing in this series?

It's pretty clear that Tywin is the type of person who considers being the man behind the man to be a more stable, desirable, and powerful position than being the man. And no, not everyone else in the series is an evil narcissist who has random girls gangraped to inflict psychological trauma on their beloved sons for the crime of slightly staining the family name.

&gt;Seriously, you might want to tone down the naivete down a couple notches. I mean, it isn't like Eddard or Robb was planning on opening a bunch of orphanages and hospitals once they won. It isn't like Daenerys wants to return to Westeros so she can bring democracy and civil rights to it. I don't think Renly or Stannis want to be king so they can establish a parliament and ensure all peasants have the right to an education. Improving the lives of the peons by not starting stupid wars and getting them killed and just generally being an efficient and fair ruler seems like the most good you can do in a medieval setting, to me.

There are people who try to achieve their goals with a minimum of doing horrible things to people and there are people who revel in doing horrible things to people as long as it helps fulfill their goals. Which is Tywin? Oh, and who sent Gregor Clegane to commit all manner of atrocities against the Tully's peasants because a former Tully kidnapped the son he doesn't even like?

I got this far typing out this post and then I realized that you think Arya is more evil than Tywin.

"c1zpurm","I meant the Industrial Revolution itself, because it was perhaps the most profound event in terms of the progression of our lifestyle. Using the argument that it didn't go so well for workers or the environment implies that it ""goes so well"" now. An example I like to use is child labor. A child working 12 hours a day sounds cruel and vicious, but is it worse than a starving child? Or, how minimum wage laws protect us, yet through the paperwork it requires to employ someone, people are left unemployed or work illegally. It's impossible to evaluate the level of inhibition regulation would have had, but I'm willing to bet it would have been a significant degree.

If a company grows as powerful to maintain full control over all aspects of a product's production and distribution to the extent that no competition is possible, then you end up with Big Pharma. So I'm not sure how regulation is helping us there. Where, had there not been regulation, people would smoke cheap weed to mellow out instead of propping up a multi-billion dollar global conglomerate selling chill pills (and much worse). I also believe that if a company is truly evil, a society will at some point reject them regardless of their supply chain. Instead, now we have a situation where these companies are not only economically immovable, but are woven in with governmental bureaucracy where they've found ways to  exert even more control.

Without regulation, I could make my own recipe and sell my own cleaner.

"c1vyq1t","Hoping to strike some balance in the discussion I'm excerpting section XIX from Lysander Spooner's Vices are not Crimes. Sorry for length:

But it is said, that for one person to entice another into a vice, is a crime. This is preposterous. If any particular act is simply a vice, then a man who entices another to commit it, is simply an accomplice in the vice. He evidently commits no crime, because the accomplice can certainly commit no greater offence than the principal.

Every person who is sane, compos mentis, possessed of reasonable discretion and self-control, is presumed to be mentally competent to judge for himself of all the arguments, pro and con, that may be addressed to him, to persuade him to do any particular act; provided no fraud is employed to deceive him. And if he is persuaded or induced to do the act, his act is then his own; and even though the act prove to be harmful to himself, he cannot complain that the persuasion or arguments, to which he yielded his assent, were crimes against himself.

When fraud is practised, the case is, of course, different. If, for example, I offer a man poison, assuring him that it is a safe and wholesome drink, and he, on the faith of my assertion, swallows it, my act is a crime.

Volenti non fit injuria, is a maxim of the law. To the willing, no injury is done. That is, no legal wrong. And every person who is sane, compos mentis, capable of exercising reasonable discretion in judging of the truth or falsehood of the representations or persuasion to which he yields his assent, is ""willing,"" in the view of the law,; and takes upon himself the entire responsibility for his acts, when no intentional fraud has been practised upon him

....

It is not a crime, even, to assist a person to commit suicide, if he be in possession of his reason.

It is a somewhat common idea that suicide is, of itself, conclusive evidence of insanity. But, although it may ordinarily be very strong evidence of insanity, it is by no means conclusive in all cases. Many persons, in undoubted possession of their reason, have committed suicide, to escape the shame of a public exposure for their crimes, or to avoid some other great calamity. Suicide, in these cases, may not have been the highest wisdom, but it certainly was not proof of any lack of reasonable discretion.3 And being within the limits of reasonable discretion, it was no crime for other persons to aid it, either by furnishing the instrument or otherwise. And if, in such cases, it be no crime to aid a suicide, how absurd to say that, it is a crime to aid him in some act that is really pleasurable, and which a large portion of mankind have believed to be useful?

Card's gynophobia: Ender's game has two female characters. The first, Violet, is constantly threatening to *literally* destroy the human race by withholding emotional support from her brother. Her character arc is about coming to accept her subservience to the male military hierarchy and to disarm her lethal weapon, i.e. her feminine indifference. The second, Petra, is described by Card as appearing physically male when she appears nude. This is apparently an important point as Card earlier states that women are absent from the ranks of the Launchies because they are innately incapable of performing at a high enough mental or physical level to pass the tests required to join the group. A feminine presence would thus indicate weakness and thus omen cataclysmic failure of the whole effort, so Card ensures that Petra is both physically and emotionally masculine.

Naked little boys: the references are casual but frequent, and Card clearly cares that we are periodically aware of it. It's not that the nudity is prurient, but rather that it is fetishistic. It's all there to remind you that this is one big swinging dick party and that any shame, violence or exploitation done to these children is rendered OK by the ends. Ender's sleep deprivation, social alienation and physical abuse are all part of the same fetish, i.e. obsession with a vicious but innocent superman archetype that is incapable of weakness, failure or accountability for his own actions. It's classic fascist iconography.

Regardless of all this, I still think the major barrier to filming Ender's Game would be the tedium of watching 90 minutes of constant battles in a zero-gravity practice room. That is of course the major content of the book.

Let's suppose they finally manage to build a small number of 50's style ICBMs. They'll keep some and sell some to Iran. There's always a possibility of interdicting the ships. Still a few get through. Still a dozen or so low tech ICBMs are not that hard to shoot down with SM-3 missiles or even Patriot batteries in the likely target countries. They can't make enough of them to overwhelm the defences, plus there's deterrence.

&gt; Finally, the NK gov. has lasted 60 years, it can probably last another 60.

That's a very poor argument. The Soviet Union collapsed after 70 years as did most of Eastern Europe. The Chinese regime would have collapsed if they had not clamped down on Tiananmen so brutally. In fact in 1989 all sorts of tyrannies collapsed - Taiwan and South Africa for example. These regimes often have a limited life.

Move on to Kim Jong Il and the whole system was a bit rockier - militarily and economically NK was slipping behind.

"c07la4m","Legion of Doom - The Horned Made Flesh (Zyklon-B)

This Greek band take their acerbic traditional metal and slowly meld in symphonic keyboard elements, making an album that is easy to appreciate but surpasses most others in artistic vision.



Mot√∂rhead - Mot√∂rizer (SPV)

Lemmy and Company rarely go completely wrong, and so they wing another one down the middle. Like all Motorhead, most songs are cut from similar patterns and the drone wears thin, but riffs remain cutting and rhythms compelling.



Neuraxis - Thin Line Between (Prosthetic)

We all know metalcore as a genre is like an omelette -- throw everything in and hope the flavors carry a lowest common denominator mix. Neuraxis attack metalcore like a metal band, using melody and rhythm to centralize, to great effect.



Deeds of Flesh - Of What's to Come (Unique Leader)

Getting experimental, this brutal technical death metal band play with some new ideas but deliver solidly resounding songs as they try to wrap their old school metal around metalcore technique.



Hellhammer - Demon Entrails (Noise)

Three bands formed this genre: Hellhammer, Sodom and Bathory. This re-release of formative material from the first of that triumvirate shows us again how mind-blowing it must have been to be there as it happened.



Gridlink - Amber Grey (Hydra Head)

Blurring grindcore with absurdist technical elements, Gridlink make an album that upholds the best traditions of thrash mixed with speed metal and technical death metal, and by keeping it short, don't wander outside their content zone.



Averse Sefira - Advent Parallax (Candlelight)

This rarity upholds old school black metal and infuses it with classic death metal. Like Morbid Angel from the Convenant era colliding with Graveland from the time of Thousand Swords, this band makes vicious but beautiful music.



Bahimiron - Southern Nihilizm (Moribund)

Imagine early Impaled Nazarene and Gorgoroth combined: fast, melodic riffs with a tendency to deconstruct everything they touch. Although slightly confused in ideals, Bahimiron deliver music that does not compromise aggression or darkness.



Intestine Baalism - Ultimate Instinct (No Colours)

Swedish death metal fanatics make an album in tribute to all three eras of Swedish death metal -- the initial surge, Gothenburg and NWOSDM, combined. It's an improvement over their last and most things coming out of Sweden.



Master - Slaves To Society Re-Release (Ibex Moon)

Evolving from their early primitive roots, Master present us an album that is rippingly fast like Slayer and uses melodic fills to good effect, but never compromises the driving roadhouse rhythms that pound this music forward.



Skepticism - Alloy (Red Stream)

Lush ambient doom surges resoundingly throughout this album, like dye in a pool tracked by the motion of carp. It is meditative, powerful and insightful, but prefers not to state these explicitly, rather letting you absorb them from the resonance.
