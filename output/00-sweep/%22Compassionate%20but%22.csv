"g3bywh3","Oh, please. You guys are the ones arguing with nature. What female in nature actually acts the way you guys associate with women/feminine energy? Short of maybe the very few on the very bottom of the natural order of dominance in herd/group/pack animals? Females would never survive in nature if they were so different from males.

No, the power dynamic is NOT different in anything other than sheer physical strength and societal/cultural/religious programming. This kind of generalization comes way too close to feminine good, masculine bad. 

We have got to quit generalizing energies like that. 

Let me give you an example of why:

Feminine energy - passive. She poisons you.  
Masculine energy - active. He stabs you.

What difference does it make? You're DEAD. It's not as simple as all that. 

It's also not about how much of the energies a woman uses, but which traits she uses from each side. The way the two energies combine can make the difference bewteen a feminine woman and a toxic feminine one. Yes, femininity can absolutely be bad. And yes, women can be toxic masculine as well. 

If she's very nurturing and compassionate (from the feminine), she can draw on protectiveness and agression from the masculine to protect and save her child from harm.

If she lacks nuturing and compassionate, but has a lot of the other traits from the feminine side, for example the softer, giving, less secure traits coupled with feeling/emotional, etc., and you have a super jealous person. Now, if that one draws on protectiveness and agresssion from the masculine, you have your classic psycho stalker who is likely to kill you. Add the female creativity to it, and she'll even be able to work around the law, making her twice as dangerous.

Statement like yours is exactly why female sexual predators are getting away with what they're doing so often. Whether they're toxic feminine or toxic masculine, they simply hide behind ""I'm a woman, and as such, I generally use more feminine energy, so I couldn't possibly be dangerous."" Because, you know, feminine equals good.

How she uses power also has less to do with how naturally dominant she is. She can be super feminine and super dominant at the same time. Or super masculine but super submissive. And all the other possible combinations. Once again, which traits from each energy come together matter way more than how much of each energy a person uses when it comes to what kind of person the individual is, and how the person behaves.

I might be understanding you wrong, So, could you please give me some examples of how the power dynamics are different.

Take away risk factors (the man being physically stronger, unwanted pregnancy and having to raise a child on her own), and take away cultural/societal/religious programming, and explain to me how the dynamics are different.",1598773076,"if she's very nurturing and compassionate (from the feminine), she can draw on protectiveness and agression from the masculine to protect and save her child from harm.","nurturing and compassionate","compassionate",NA,FALSE,"very nurturing and compassionate","nurturing",NA,"very",0

"g37d7oc","Friend, this is about bigger issues than dick size (pun intended). I myself don’t fully understand because I would have not been ok with a girlfriend doing anything sexual with another man, but I get that it might be hot. However, now that it happened you have to address it. 

One way to address it is by shutting down and not saying anything. This will likely magnify your insecurities and hurt her feelings, because she won’t fully understand why you went from the guy who enthusiastically “participated” in a hot sexual act for her to the guy who got weird and insecure about anything. 

Another way to address it is to talk about it. Take some time to think about why you’re feeling so down about the whole thing. Was it her “expression of joy” upon finishing the other dude? That might have been merely sexual excitement and not, like, a revelation about what she’s missing with you. Was it your (apparently) smaller penis? That would be your problem, not hers—it’s hard to do, but you should focus on sexually pleasing her with your equipment (including hands, tongue, foreplay, dirty talk, whatever) rather than putting the burden of your insecurity on her. Get ready to explain these things. 

Then ask for her perspective. Listen. Try to understand. If she asks to do it again, you can explain how the first time made you feel. If she says she enjoyed giving a BJ that way, ask her to treat your dick like she treated the other guy’s. If she’s not 100% positive about it, sympathize. 

If you think the whole thing was a mistake, you should tell her that, and tell her why. Maybe you’ll break up over it, maybe you won’t. But as other have said, it’s that you can’t handle it; it’s not her fault that you didn’t like it. If you both agree to work through it, maybe you can do other things sexually that won’t remind you of your friend. 

You took a risk and you didn’t like the result. It sounds like you thought it would be hot for you to watch her in action with someone else, and didn’t consider that she’d think it pretty hot as well. Hey, that’s part of life and growing up. Be an adult and face the consequences. Your GF probably wants you and not your friend, not least because you tried something sexually adventurous with her. Do her the courtesy of being honest and compassionate—you might find that it’s something else she loves in you. 

If, on the other hand, there’s a breakup over this, don’t be the guy who got insecure and juvenile over something to which you both agreed. Be the guy who was honest and compassionate but in the end wasn’t ok with sharing his GF. That’s respectable both to women and to men.",1598669429,"do her the courtesy of being honest and compassionate—you might find that it’s something else she loves in you.","honest and compassionate","compassionate",NA,FALSE,"honest and compassionate","honest",NA,NA,0
"g36gc6f","I couldn't agree more, but disengaging is not always an available option.  My mother is an excellent example of this (*especially* slide 2).  

After an esophageal cancer diagnosis last year she moved in with my husband and me.  She has made a full recovery, but I can honestly say I've had moments when I wished she hadn't recovered given her insidious, selfish, polluting behavior.

My husband and I already had more than enough to deal with, but caring for her would not have been a burden or problem if she showed, even now, the slightest inkling of respect for our boundaries, home and wishes.

"g33y515","I agree with Stella, and building on what she said, your NN is cnj your MC. Since ""the missing leg"" of the t-square is often described as where the native could effectively put their energy, that reinforces the NN (""soul"" growth) and MC (lifepath) as important pursuits for you.

You asked how to alleviate this...One way is to look for the ""easy"" aspects that provide an outlet for that tense energy. Neptune jumps out to me for that. It forms trines with your 12th house Sun-Mercury and sextiles your 6th house Pluto. It's on the cusp of your 9th house, which has Cap on the cusp and Saturn in domicile located in that house. That's a strong placement and suggests to me that the philosophy/spiritual outlook that you develop can be highly effective in moving you forward. Saturn in the 9th and in Cap suggests to me that you'll benefit from a pragmatic philosophy, one that takes to heart the serenity prayer (accept what can't be changed, have courage to change what can be, and the wisdom to know the difference).

The fixed t-square can have you facing insurmountable challenges that you truly can't change. :( Or it might have you *wishing* you could change things that truly cannot be changed and putting energy (mental and physical) into that...Either way, you will be able to experience a great deal of healing when you take a pragmatic approach instead, when you experience the spiritual truth and power in that.

You also have your Saturn in sextile with your exalted Venus in Pisces, reinforcing how strong your Saturn is and shaping it as a loving, compassionate source of spiritual strength for you. Definitely focus on real, concrete, pragmatic things you can do, even if they seem like they barely put a dent in your struggle, and even if it's mostly just a shift in your thinking towards adopting a compassionate but realistic philosophy/spirituality. That *will* help you. :)

You might also find solace in directing your energies towards the suffering of the collective, but that might come later down the road when you're feeling better. It will also be vital that you keep in mind that many problems are largely out of our individual control, but what you can do (even if it seems like too little to you) is enormous for those it helps.

"g2uzdxy","A couple of things:

- Not all buyers are allowed to accept that much cash from the seller, let alone for repairs. And if they are allowed to accept it, it would have to be in the form of paying their closing costs. Not a bad idea, right? Except that buyers fear you’ll yank that off the table if the house appraises low. It’s just risky for everyone involved.

- A lot of little repairs add up to a major concern that the sellers don’t know how to properly maintain a home. The worry is that there will be other defects that they won’t know about until after closing. It’s the whole ‘where there’s smoke, there’s fire’ thing. Again, it’s a risk buyers don’t necessarily want to take.

- Old electrical wiring is scary to some buyers and the fact that some insurance companies won’t cover it (or will charge more if they do) doesn’t help them feel better. If it is present along with a bunch of minor repairs, they’ll feel like they need to walk away because they’d be requesting too many repairs.

- Your buyer’s agent may not be able to recognize ‘lipstick on a pig,’ but many do. If there are lingering signs of poor workmanship from the flip AND a lot of minor repairs AND old wiring, agents may not be able to overcome all those objections. 

- Your listing agent is probably not experienced enough to advise you on which repairs you should have made prior to listing. Even those of of us with construction/renovation backgrounds have to learn which items will show up on inspections, which ones are important, what a buyer can reasonably request, etc. Lots of local norms come into play, so you really need a solid agent that can advise you properly.

A couple of suggestions for you. I don’t know that I’d advise you to do all of them, but you can determine which ones make sense for your situation:

- Tell your agent to call both buyer’s agents and ask for the inspection reports. In some states that have to provide the full report, but in states like mine the report belongs to the buyer and I can’t share it with my cat unless the buyer grants permission. Usually buyers will share it if they are walking away, though, and it is only withheld out of a sense of realtor etiquette. (It’s considered a ‘dick move’ to send the entire report to the listing agent without being explicitly asked.)

- I know there’s a concern that if you have this info you’ll have to disclose it, but honestly you are flying blind without it. State laws may vary, but in my market we are lucky to get the age of the roof on the property disclosure (dead serious - I refer to it as the ‘age of roof form’). Everyone plays dumb on the seller’s side and we take the ‘buyer beware’ approach when advising our buyers on the importance of inspections. But I’m a firm believer that in order to make solid financial decisions you need to collect and review all relevant data. Maybe this data wasn’t considered relevant in the beginning but it is now.

- The reason I advise going ahead and getting the report is so you can do most of the repairs. Yes, every inspector has a different tolerance level for defects and reports do vary. But they are all using the same checklist and obviously these two did a good job if they ran off two buyers. If you can’t get the report, hire an inspector yourself. 

- Once repairs have been made, you can update the realtor remarks to say ‘all inspection repairs completed except X, Y, Z and seller is offering a discount on price and/or a home warranty and/or cash toward buyer’s closing costs for everything else. Savvy agents know how to ‘read’ the listing history and we can tell with a high degree of accuracy why a deal fell apart just by looking at the dates. You’d think we’d pick up the phone and ask the listing agent ‘did the deal fall through due to inspection findings?’ but that’s a fruitless pursuit in my market became we hear no evil and see no evil. Go ahead and address the elephant in the room so buyers know you are motivated and responsible sellers.

- Speaking of realtors, I really don’t like the idea of telling you to get a new agent because I wouldn’t want someone to hear my seller’s frustrations (that may/may not actually be related to my performance) and tell them to fire me. But I will tell you that on my first few listings I had a mentor holding my hand to ensure I represented my sellers well. Even now, I’ll call my broker or other agents at my firm and be like, ‘what would you do in my shoes?’ Every transaction is unique and they all come with their own special challenges. That’s why we love this business! But we have to be self-aware enough to know what we don’t know, and we must be humble enough to ask for help. If your gut is saying that this realtor isn’t a good fit, then friendships be damned. This is real wealth we are talking about here, and your retirement (at least in part) depends on your making informed decisions as you buy/sell. Be kind and compassionate, but don’t feel like you need to stick with a realtor who isn’t meeting your expectations. (And I wouldn’t have typed all this out with my thumbs on my iPhone if I thought your expectations are too high.) If you do decide to change realtors, you could offer to reimburse the realtor for their photography expenses. You’ll make it up later in the sale (or at least sleep well at night knowing you did a nice thing.)

- Consider paying s structural engineer to provide a letter describing those foundation defects. Most of the time they don’t require immediate repair and they just look scary to buyers, so you are better off just getting an expert to weigh in. It’s surprisingly inexpensive to hire these engineers but do ask around and make sure you get the one in your city that all the realtors collectively agree is the go-to. Don’t use a random company if you can get the one that we all know/trust for $50 more.

I think that’s everything! I know it’s a lot but you said you wanted honesty.

"g2uowo2","Warning: lots of words about Harry Potter incoming!

I think that this is basically a remnant of the way that JK Rowling changed her opinion on various aspects of her own setting as the series kind of lurched from children's fiction to YA fiction, where attempts to add more nuance to the House traits wound up meandering back and forth on how it would actually relate to the main characters.

In Philosopher's Stone, for example, Gryffindor is for heroes, Slytherin is for villains, Ravenclaw is for nerds, and Hufflepuff is for everyone else. Each of the three main protagonists shares traits with another non-Gryffindor house; Harry has Slytherin aspects because there's a bit of darkness to him, Hermione has Ravenclaw aspects because she's smart, and Ron has Hufflepuff aspects because he's a good friend, but all three are **heroes** first and foremost. Ron is a weaker example of a ""sort of Hufflepuff"" because the fourth quasi-member of the main cast - Neville - is *explicitly* someone who thinks they're a Hufflepuff that wound up in Gryffindor somehow. 

The next couple of books start to expand on the ""x trait is y house"" aspect in a way that maps to the classical Four Temperaments *fairly* closely (not exactly, but close enough that I honestly wouldn't be surprised if it was a source of inspiration):

* Gryffindor is the Sanguine temperament - outgoing, adventurous, ""brave"" in that they stand up for what they think is right, but prone to shortsightedness, risk-taking, and idealism

* Ravenclaw is the Melancholic temperament - analytical and detail-oriented, but also rigid, introverted, and possibly even depressive 

* Hufflepuff is the Phlegmatic temperament - relaxed and compassionate, but prone to being timid or even submissive 

* Slytherin is the Choleric temperament - driven, independent, and ambitious, but prone to arrogance, vindictiveness, and outright violence

The middle of the series is where - in my personal opinion - the various Gryffindors have their ""sub-Houses"" expressed most clearly. While each House has a primary trait from each of the Temperaments associated with it, the possibility of people having traits common to other houses is now portrayed less as ""if you are x, you are in y house"" and more ""if you are **primarily** x, you are in y house"".  For example:

* Even though Hermione is extremely analytical and a perfectionist (Sanguine/Ravenclaw traits), she is ***not*** anywhere near ""introverted"", demonstrating over and over that when she finds something she disagrees with, she immediately sets about trying to change that thing

* Harry is honestly a solid mix of Sanguine (adventurous and brave, but impulsive and risk-taking) and Choleric (ambitious and independent, but *really* prone to outbursts and frequently downright aggressive) traits from basically here on out, befitting the whole ""Gryffindor with a big chunk of Slytherin"" way he was portrayed in the first book. Now that Slytherins are a *bit* more complex than just ""evil"", Harry can dip into the ""strengths"" of those traits without derailing his ""hero"" status

* Ron continues to be portrayed as a kind of half-hearted Hufflepuff, he definitely shows some Hufflepuff/Phlegmatic traits (a good friend and dependable, but lazy and stubborn), but the fact that he's Harry's main adventure sidekick in these books is really the central part of his character for now

* Neville, again, is there to absorb the rest of the leftover Hufflepuff traits while he continues to shuffle towards and away from being *almost* a main character or a minor character: he's a good listener and all, but he's honestly kind of bumbling and cowardly in Chamber of Secrets and Prisoner of Azkaban 

This is a fairly common writing technique to differentiate characters from each other, so I personally would argue that things like ""Hermione has a whole bunch of Ravenclaw going on"" and ""Harry should have been in Slytherin"" are less in-universe conspiracies and more an aspect of worldbuilding that was meant to deepen their personalities. That said, I also wouldn't say that this was necessarily executed the best that it could have been.

From basically the end of Prisoner of Azkaban onwards, the whole ""X house has Y traits"" thing kind of gets downplayed *and* re-simplified: we see villainous Gryffindors and heroic characters from other houses, even a couple ""not outright villainous"" Slytherins, but the houses kind of wind up boiled down to ""Gryffindors are brave, Ravenclaws are intelligent, Hufflepuffs are loyal, and Slytherins are ambitious/evil"" once again. Neville continues to move in and out of the background, but his courageousness starts to grow in Order of the Phoenix and never really stops (finally marking him as a ""true Gryffindor"").

There's a couple interesting things in books 4-7 of the series from a ""House Temperaments"" perspective:

* Harry starts to pick up more *Ravenclaw* traits as he grows up - he becomes more analytical, but also more withdrawn in many ways

* Ron becomes much more *Slytherin*, of all things - jealousy becomes a major flaw of his, and he starts becoming more concerned with status (especially his social status) rather than his primary flaw being laziness 

Overall I'd argue that the ""House Traits"" kind of become re-stereotyped as Rowling seemed to be uncertain on how much she wanted to commit to this concept. In particular, the entire series basically fails to conclusively decide whether Slytherin is the evil house or not: Slughorn is introduced as a purely ""ambitious"" Slytherin, Draco and Narcissa Malfoy get key moments of redemption, and Snape is revealed as neither ""good"" nor ""evil"", but all Slytherin students are locked up during the Battle of Hogwarts because they're untrustworthy, *but* some later participate on the heroes' side, and so on. Given that the *vast* majority of villains are Slytherins, and Harry's own Slytherin-esque traits are written off as being due to the influence of Voldemort's Horcrux in him, it almost comes off as if she backed away from depicting complexity of personality traits in favour of trying to depict more complex *morality*. 

**TL;DR**: I think that the three main characters were meant to represent the other Houses while having their primary traits be those of House Gryffindor, which was probably a writing technique rather than Dumbledore intentionally stacking the house. The depiction of ""Gryffindors are Heroes, Slytherins are Villains"" started out as an example of simpler worldbuilding, but later grew more complex, before becoming re-simplified again. In my opinion, JK Rowling never really decided if Neville was going to be a main character or not, and neither did she decide if Slytherin was the ""villain house"", both of which led to the ""house traits"" being boiled down to a single trait by the end of the series.",1598395939,"the next couple of books start to expand on the ""x trait is y house"" aspect in a way that maps to the classical four temperaments *fairly* closely (not exactly, but close enough that i honestly wouldn't be surprised if it was a source of inspiration):  * gryffindor is the sanguine temperament - outgoing, adventurous, ""brave"" in that they stand up for what they think is right, but prone to shortsightedness, risk-taking, and idealism  * ravenclaw is the melancholic temperament - analytical and detail-oriented, but also rigid, introverted, and possibly even depressive   * hufflepuff is the phlegmatic temperament - relaxed and compassionate, but prone to being timid or even submissive   * slytherin is the choleric temperament - driven, independent, and ambitious, but prone to arrogance, vindictiveness, and outright violence  the middle of the series is where - in my personal opinion - the various gryffindors have their ""sub-houses"" expressed most clearly.","relaxed and compassionate","compassionate",NA,FALSE,"compassionate , but prone","prone",NA,NA,1

"g2qagtx","I'm not denying that there isn't *some* issue here, but at least anecdotally some of it seems to be confirmation bias as well.

My wife was ranting about the doctor she was seeing for her pre-natal care. Everything that came up was just dismissed as ""that's normal"". She assumed the (female) doctor just didn't listen because she was a woman.

This was even further confirmed by the fact that she _did_ listen to me when I brought up issues.

But you know what? The doctor dismissed me all the time too. The only difference was that I persisted and finished making my case anyway, providing whatever relevant diagnostic information I could and explaining _why_ I thought it was important. And when I coached my wife to do the same thing, the doctor responded just as well to her.

The doctor handles care and deliveries at the hospital, seeing patients for scheduled appointments in her office, and answers her phone basically 24 hours a day because going in to labour doesn't necessarily happen on a schedule.

She's a person too. She's obviously very caring and compassionate, but it's totally understandable that when she's basically working 24 hours a day and she's on her 30th patient of the day that maybe she's not going to be as fully engaged as she could be.

"g2oq5bi","&gt; Your pretended authority seems to be limited to this r/Zen forum and it was gained by hanging around for a very long time

My pretend authority is limited to nothing.

It was not gained, nor have I ""hung around"" for a very long time.

&gt; Nobody gave you deputy MOD or MOD duties so, basically, you are just being a gatekeeper.

Basically I am just a compassionate but loud bystander.

&gt; That's OK, but nobody ***has*** to listen to you.

Nobody ***has*** to listen to anyone or do anything; but people do have to make choices about who to listen to and what to do.

&gt; Me? I've been around the spiritual arena for a while. Went to the dojos, ashrams, met some characters, did and do my practice. A whole cult is on my case. And as a personal note two different teachers told me something among the lines of ""get in line or gtfo"" and I just left, only to see them hoping for me to return, including the dumbass cult that is on my case with their zen adepts hanging around here and their GURU writing here. BTW I don't regard you as a teacher at all. At best a man that likes the zen texts a lot.

Good; you're already ahead of the game.

I'll be honest: I would like everyone to share in Zen. I would like everyone to see what I've seen and experience what I've experienced. But to even think I can impart that on one other person is folly.

All I can do is patiently point a finger and hope for the best.

So, if you were to ""GTFO"" I would *hope* for your return, but I honestly wouldn't give too much of a shit beyond, ""Aw, I like that dude, hopes he comes back.""

That's what's great about a public forum: you could be permabanned and you can steal read HuangBo or posts about HuangBo.

So your participation here has ""little"" to ""no"" bearing on your ability to study and come to understand Zen.

At best, I am a stoner with an internet addiction who happened to have been studying spirituality his whole life so he was in a position to understand Zen when he encountered it.

If you want to give me a ribbon for such an ""accomplishment"" then that is up to you.

If you want a ribbon it's ""Study Zen or GTFO"" and when you understand Zen, then you'll have the best ribbon of all.

&gt; See, I don't care for that stupid game, but back to our business. You say ""Study Zen or GTFO"". I say ""I'll do WTF I want.""

Ok, but I will continue to call you out for your arrogance and ignorance.

You don't understand Zen. Yet you're in r/zen spouting off some ""Oh so you wanna play?"" LARPy-ass bullshit.

Study Zen or GTFO.

&gt; And top that with telling you ""Keep doing what you are doing!"".

Likewise.

&gt; If you keep it up you are doing what I'm telling you to do. If you don't perhaps there is hope for you being more than the self-apointed MOD of r/Zen.

I'm not even that. 

People wouldn't let me be a mod here because I would just ban all the insincere trolls and let the sincere ones ask to come back.

I think a lot of people know that would include them.

IMO there are AT MOST 5 total people who understand Zen that aren't lurkers here.

I'm hoping there are many more among the lurker population but most people are nervous here each day, hoping not to get ""found out.""

What people don't realize is that Zen is within their powers of comprehension. If they would just set aside their egos, and attempt to make sense of the more-than-adequate translations that are available, they can come to understand for themselves and then all the uneasiness and difficulty would go away.

&gt; Your call dude. Either I'm the authority or you stop being a ZenBot.

Why not study Zen while you're here instead?

Individuals in rural communities can be very smart and compassionate. But there is no escaping the reality that for many they are insulated from diversity. Diversify of thought and diversity of people. And as such they tend to cluster around the same cultural attitudes. And going against the local culture is often social suicide. Hence the rural voter is typically more myopic in their understanding of issues. And particularly less equipped to understand urban issues than urban people are to understand rural issues. Because those rural attitudes also exist within urban and especially suburban envrionments.

It's not so much a function of intelligence as it is being exposed to different ideas and allowing different ideas to exist.

"g1lgjzo","I could say more if you clarified what you meant by “relationships"", as in (1) what problems are you having and (2) more importantly, has it been more problematic in the past few years?  Because, in general, I would guess from your chart, without you telling me that by virtue of Sun in Libra, you are interested in relationships.  A problem with Sun in 12th house is that it has a secretive, ""hiding"" quality, even prone to secret affairs, and Libra knows that honesty and transparency is vital in relationships. Sun in Libra square with Natal Neptune an Natal Uranus in Capricorn could be a basic problem of conflicting and chaotic misunderstandings and clashes, and you not feeling comfortable expressing yourself, or receiving blowback when you do.  I’m feeling that with that Mars in Scorpio you have a strong side that says ""Too bad...the truth is the truth...deal with it.""  But when others ""deal with it"" by pulling away from you, relationships suffer.  Especially in the past years and most recent year of Capricorn transits aspecting those points.  I believe you are also VERY smart and Very Intense (Mars conjuct Pluto in Scorpio) others get intimidated and, again, they pull away.  Venus in Scorpio can be very very kind (as long as they do not feel threatened 😊)...maybe you need to be more kind about the many MANY mere mortals not gifted with your high intelligence And extraordinary will and intensity.  Mercury in 11th house craves mental stimulation from others, so you, dear Sun in Libra, need to find the balance.  Scorpio ascending will actually sabotage relationships, so when it looks like people pull away, it’s that you did that weird Scorpio alchemy of ""pushing them away"" via sabotage.  I honestly don’t think you can compromise much with less intelligent or weaker-willed people.  You are just too smart and too strong.  Sun in 12th house can be very compassionate, so again, be kind and be patient and compassionate.  But don’t put a lot of energy into incompatible associates (friends, family, partners associates), because you will sabotage unworkable things in the end anyway.",1597502254,"sun in 12th house can be very compassionate, so again, be kind and be patient and compassionate.","patient and compassionate","compassionate",NA,FALSE,"patient and compassionate","patient",NA,NA,0
"g1hpft5","Hey! In many ways Dostoevsky and Nietzsche contradict each other, but in many ways they are two sides of the same coin, like you imply. Like you said, they're both reacting against nihilism and trying to find a way to live fulfilling, meaningful lives. In order to this, though, they head in opposite directions. Although, arguably, both of their paths are part of any meaningful life. Put simply, Dostoevsky talks about the path of love and Nietzsche talks about the path of power. Any happy life is going to include both of these things to some degree. We all need healthy, fulfilling relationships (love) and some amount of self-respect (power). One entirely without the other would be unsustainable. In many ways, these thinkers are complimentary.

But where do they contradict? Well, Nietzsche hates pity and Dostoevsky hates pride. For Nietzsche it's okay to be caring and compassionate---BUT only if you think the other person is worthy or it isn't getting in the way of your other desires. It's something to be handled very, very carefully. ""Where are your greatest dangers?---ln pity."" (The Gay Science) Pity is the really dangerous part of love, because pity doesn't judge and treats everyone the same. For him, pity is disrespectful to a person's individual identity, because it treats all pain the same and, for him, pretends to understand the unique, untranslatable pain of people we barely even know. It ignores what their pain actually means to them. It turns everyone into dogs, not men with pride and a self-narrative. But more importantly, in treating all humans the same, pity means the dissolution of your ego and judgement. Being one with others. For Nietzsche, this is disrespectful to his own identity.

This wasn't just some abstract concern for him. There's actually a letter where Nietzsche talks about how he would sometimes write all day, go outside, smile at a passerby and share some kinds words, then for just a moment afterwards he would feel that everything he has written is all lies. It's sort of like how Raskolnikov occasionally does some kind action out of pity (helps the drunk girl, etc.), then immediately rebukes himself for being stupid. His pride is afraid of giving up his ego. This is why Dostoevsky doesn't like pride. It gets in our way of us experiencing Universal Love, because we refuse to our to give up our judgement or to see ourselves as equivalent and as worthy of love as everyone else.

I could say a lot more. There's actually a million ways to compare the two, but maybe I've already written way too much.

"g1e5t95","&gt;Better to hold out for that as long as it takes than try to “fix” yourself and hope that someone will accept the better version of you. 

Agree the goal is to avoid being disingenuous just to enter a relationship, but I find this statement interesting because there has to be some cutoff. Using this approach, telling a person to change their fashion sense and take better selfies is arguably trying to 'fix' yourself in some way to attract a date.

Personally, I'd look at trying to figure out why a person is not '*relationship material*' for lack of better term and it could easily be trivial things like a hatred for ketchup, but it could just as easily be that they're coming off as cold and insensitive. At this point, if they're a warm and loving person and learn to convey this (instead of cold and insensitive) they're going to have a much better time dating, whilst still being genuine - arguably moreso.

On the flipside, if the person is coming off as cold and insensitive, whilst actually being cold and insensitive - I'd question if that's what the person wants to be in the long term. Maybe it's something they would love to be (warm and compassionate) but just lack the skill-set, in which case the 'fix' is prompted by dating/partners, but something the person wants for themselves - which I'd also consider a win.

So while I agree that 'fixing' something you like about yourself for another person is usually a terrible idea, I also think using relationships as the reason for positive change is a great way to grow.",1597367374,"maybe it's something they would love to be (warm and compassionate) but just lack the skill-set, in which case the 'fix' is prompted by dating/partners, but something the person wants for themselves - which i'd also consider a win.","warm and compassionate","compassionate",NA,FALSE,"warm and compassionate","warm",NA,NA,0
"g1dk8gk","I'm quite shocked at the comments here tbh. Depression is really serious, if it's that bad you're unable to work for such a prolonged period that is really concerning.

NAH if you're really that debilitated you need to think of long term options, you can't expect your wife or family to support you indefinitely. 8 months is a super long time for someone to be supporting you emotionally and financially etc but I appreciate that recovering and working through your depression is going to take a lot more time and work it's not a quick fix. Taking time to plan your recovery could give you some hope and structure and improve your mental health, there will be ups and downs though so be compassionate but firm with yourself. I would also (if you've not already) try to see if there are any underlying health issues that could also be prolonging your recovery. Chronic illness and depression are very common cohorts.

It is also important to note the pressure your wife is under, she's not only stressed and tired with work, but also must feel extremely anxious and worried about you. The stress burn out she's experiencing can also have huge and prolonged health impacts if not dealt with. You need to talk together about expectations and what is achievable in your recovery and also in supporting her. It won't be an easy conversation but it has to be had, maybe the therapist could do a joint session to meditate the conversation and help come up with a plan.",1597356157,"taking time to plan your recovery could give you some hope and structure and improve your mental health, there will be ups and downs though so be compassionate but firm with yourself.","compassionate but firm","compassionate","but",FALSE,"compassionate but firm","firm",NA,NA,1

"g13iwfj","**Craig Immel**

Age: 44

Occupation: Construction manager and urban farmer

**Why are you running for mayor?**

I am running for mayor because Tulsa needs a truly nonpartisan approach to better quality decision making. I have been extremely disappointed in the current mayor's failure to properly consider the facts, opinions and needs of the community when it comes to matters of education, public safety, economic development, government transparency, state preemption of local control, racial equality, and COVID-19 response.

I am ready, willing and able to step in to provide the nonpartisan leadership we need to move Tulsa forward.

**What is the most serious challenge facing the city and how would you seek to address it if you are elected?**

Aside from the current COVID-19 health and economic crisis, Tulsa's most serious challenge to effective municipal government is simply its location within the jurisdiction of the state of Oklahoma. One defining characteristic of Oklahoma's dysfunctional and hyper-partisan political landscape is its excessive preemption of Tulsa's ability to run our city the way we see fit. Tulsa citizens are smart, innovative, entrepreneurial and compassionate, but our ability to build our brand and remain competitive nationally and world-wide is held back by backward policies made at the state legislature in Oklahoma City. Tulsa's brand perception worldwide is at risk until we can get the word out that Tulsa is a much better place than all the embarrassing stories about Oklahoma politics would have other Americans believe. But to truly live up to a stronger brand for Tulsa, we first have to be assertive in standing up for ourselves as a city, and to finally decouple Tulsa's fortunes from those of the rest of Oklahoma.

**What will be your top priorities?**

Development of appropriate science and fact-based COVID-19 response and recovery strategies is the most urgent priority right now. However, as a father to a Tulsa Public Schools student, fighting for the future of our public schools, kids, parents and teachers is my number one priority for the next four years.

**What personal qualities and work experiences do you have that you believe qualify you to be mayor?**

I have always been known as honest, fair, compassionate, empathetic, and respectful of people from all walks of life. I also have a hard-won reputation for having the courage to stand up for what is right, even when I have to do it alone.

Over the course of my professional career, I have learned to expertly blend business acumen, vision, integrity, and work ethic with team building and communications skills, to earn the reputation of an adaptable team player who knows how to get things done. I am looking forward to bringing these same skills and personal traits to City Hall as Tulsa’s next mayor.

**If you are elected mayor, would you work to pursue a police oversight program similar to what has been proposed by Mayor G.T. Bynum?**

Yes

**Would you support continued work to address the disparities in outcomes outlined in the city's Equality Indicators reports?**

Yes

**Why should Tulsans vote for you as opposed to any of the other candidates?**

I bring a unique combination of personal traits, leadership skills, education, and life and professional experience that set me apart from the other candidates. I have direct experience in working with diverse groups of leading city planners, economic developers, builders and advocates from around the world, sharing the common goal of creating thriving urban environments designed to meet social, economic and environmental sustainability goals for all citizens, businesses and stakeholders. Most importantly, Tulsans can trust me to fight aggressively for the best interest of our city.

In 2015, I took a bold stand against an illegal, backroom deal to sell off a large parcel of River Parks land at Helmerich Park to an out-of-state strip mall developer for pennies on the dollar. That deal was originated in a previous mayor's administration, but Mayor Bynum doubled down on it when he came into office, completely ignoring the pleas of thousands of concerned Tulsans. When all the typical outreach to the mayor, City Council, city planners, TPFA members, and others received no response, I initiated legal action to stop the illegal park sale, and was later joined in the lawsuit by other prominent Tulsa park supporters, including former Tulsa Mayor Terry Young, taking the case all the way to the Oklahoma Supreme Court.

That's actually a very difficult question, but it indisputably does. 

My theory is it's the fact that a lot of young people (disproportionately, but not always, young women) have some form of mild-to-severe anxiety disorder that they believe will be solved by learning psychology. Either that or they were the ""empathetic"" (read, compassionate but highly emotional) high school friend who just wanted to understand and fix everyone's problems.

"g0oh00w","Ok friend if you ask me, I'd tell you this:

A number one - first drop the kratom.  Right away or as soon as possible while you're still on these other drugs.  They will completely eradicate almost all withdrawal symptoms (you'll still probably have a few days of uncomfortable bowel patterns during the first 7ish days, to put it nicely).  If you stay on kratom to deal with your phenibut taper, you will very likely use more and more - which of course, over time you'll need to do anyway, just as with any opioid.  And if you're still on that once the GABA meds are gone...trust me, quitting that stuff fucking suuuuucccckkkkssss a giant scabby cock.  Get off now, while it's super super easy.  For reference, I quit a 90-120 gpd habit cold turkey with zero issues thanks to phenibut.  The only real positive thing it ever did for me, I guess. 

Number 2 - I think you're right, a ""medium"" taper is the way to go with the phenibut. You can find plenty of advice here in the sub, and if you want mine, just ask. Mine went pretty damn well.  HOWEVER, that said, I think at some point it's definitely best to switch over to baclofen and taper that instead.  Definitely preferable to gabapentin in my eyes. If you can't get a sizable quantity from a doctor, there are a number of places online, just dig around this sub, or again, ask me and I'll tell you.  I personally would wait to switch to baclofen when you're around 4-6g phenibut daily, but that's just me.  80mg QD is the common max daily dose in the medical realm...although in very rare cases people do exceed that...but it ain't a good plan.  You can pretty easily taper down to 4gpd and then switch. And baclofen is way easier to quit from.  I'll be done this time next month....God willing. 

Finally, and maybe most importantly, start preparing NOW for the flat affect you'll probably feel once you get really low, or off completely.  You're very likely going to have some issues with dopamine and seratonin for a while. So start building as many daily habits as you can RIGHT NOW to begin pumping out your own endogenous neurotransmitters as soon as possible.  Lift weights or exercise, daily. Start riding a bike or taking walks. Take up a rewarding hobby. Study a new exciting subject. Find people you love and spend time with them. Any or all of these things, be creative, do you - but start doing as many of these things as you can, and do them regularly so that the become ingrained into your daily life now, while you still have all these exogenous sources of good feels.  It will make a lot of difference....at least I hope so bc that's what I'm pinning all my faith on currently.

And also finally, feel free to DM me anytime you need help or encouragement or stuff like that.  Just be aware I'm a big fan of handling shit in a pretty no nonsense kind of way.

"g0jh4ol","Name for me any municipality that is doing a better job with the limited resources they are given?

I absolutely agree that Seattle could and needs to be doing a much better job on these issues, but that can only happen if we decide to spend more money upfront, not less.

The average homeless person in Seattle, costs the city, county and state governments more than 100k per year.

Are we really saying that we can't provide housing, food, healthcare and social services to those people for less than that? 

That seems absurd to me - not to mention the fact that we could provide a much more humane and compassionate environment for the homeless for much less tax payer dollars than we do currently, there is the very likely possibility that if we provide those services to treat and stabilize the most vulnerable among us, that many of them could regain the ranks of tax paying citizens which would increase our tax revenues and decrease the overall cost of such programs.

The only real question left is whether people can get over themselves and choose to act in a manner that is not only the most humane and compassionate but also the most fiscally responsible.

Unfortunately too many people get upset at the idea of someone else getting something for ""*free*"" which they have to work for to realize that if we actually funded these programs effectively, we could reduce the overall cost to the taxpayers and efficiently convert those who desperately need a safety net from a burden to a benefit in terms of taxes in a much shorter and more effective time-span that we do currently.

Yes, there will be some people who despite our best efforts are too traumatized, addicted and otherwise fucked up to be returned to the ranks of productive tax paying citizens, and regarding that minority - I think society should just suck it up and cover that relatively small cost, because however nice it may seem to get a free ride, I very much doubt any single one of us would be interested in or willing to experience the suffering and trauma those folks have in order to get a few unearned benefits.",1596704563,"that seems absurd to me - not to mention the fact that we could provide a much more humane and compassionate environment for the homeless for much less tax payer dollars than we do currently, there is the very likely possibility that if we provide those services to treat and stabilize the most vulnerable among us, that many of them could regain the ranks of tax paying citizens which would increase our tax revenues and decrease the overall cost of such programs.","humane and compassionate","compassionate",NA,FALSE,"more humane and compassionate","humane",NA,"more",0

"g0ii9ma","I'm not sure that ""explaining"" is going to be the most successful strategy, tbh. It might be a good long-term goal, but weddings are fraught enough without trying to have this conversation. 

So I think I would start by setting some boundaries specifically for the wedding. For example, attendees are absolutely forbidden from disparaging same-sex relationships, your partner, or making any comments that you find hurtful or demeaning. And if people aren't willing to hold their tongue for a few hours while they are present, they are very welcome to stay the F home and say all the mean shit they want.... out of your earshot. If they violate this rule, they will be escorted off the premises without warning. And to this end, it might be a good idea to enlist one or two friends (ideally someone a little more... intimidating? but in a nice way) to be your ""bouncers"" and make sure those people are kindly, but firmly moved far, far away from you. You have every right to have a drama-free wedding, and ESPECIALLY in a pandemic when weddings are highly limited in number of guests, it is a privilege to be there and not a right, and if people violate your boundaries their privileges go away too. It's that simple.

In the long term, there is more you can do. However, I would start with a warning that these sorts of things are hard to ""convince"" people of. I mean, think about it - you are probably LGBT+ affirming, and no matter how much ""evidence"" people put in front of you, are you very likely to change your mind? I would hope not. 

Unfortunately, the same thing is generally true for non-affirming people. They aren't really open to changing their mind about something that they perceive as being life-or-death, heaven-or-hell matters. To them, we queer folks really are going to burn in hell for eternity and they're just trying to help us not go there. Their beliefs are wrong and misguided, but that doesn't really change the way they see things. 

At the same time, yes, it is possible to keep opening the conversation, and for a lot of people, it is very important that their family and close friends are a part of their lives, meaning they have to learn to live with each other and be kind and compassionate. But it does start with an honest attempt to get at the root of an issue, not just shouting matches and arguing. 

For many non-affirming people, their beliefs are rooted in fear. Like I mentioned, many are fearful that the people they love are condemned to damnation because of their misinterpretation of the Bible. For some, it is also a fear of the world changing around them - they are used to things being a certain way (e.g., they are familiar with men and women marrying, but they have never experienced a same-sex marriage or couple), and they react negatively to something different happening, especially if they see it as threatening their way of life or making demands on them that they aren't willing to meet. This type of conservative feels ""under attack"" and ""forced"" to do new things like use gender neutral language or avoid slurs. 

So for many people, the real issue is assuaging these fears. It's reminding them that things naturally change over time, and those changes generally do not result in the world imploding (although to be fair, the current moment isn't the best example here...) Sometimes, they need a non-judgemental space to work on changing language they aren't used to (using terms like ""spouse"" or ""partner"" instead of ""husband"" or ""wife"", for example). Often, they are afraid of being ostracized by their (bigoted) community for welcoming LGBT+ people, and they need to be reminded that a) love and compassion trumps bigotry and b) there will be many people there for them who support a more inclusive or loving attitude. 

All of these changes are HARD WORK. So I will close by reminding you to take care of yourself and set your own boundaries. If you don't have the emotional energy to work on this... don't. It is okay to take breaks. It is okay to say that certain conversations are off-limits. It is okay to turn down an invitation to a family gathering if you aren't prepared to have hard conversations with others who will be there. You are an adult - you have the right to make your own choices.

"g0hs36p","I'm so glad you wrote this.  It gives me hope that some young people are beginning to see the pattern of sensationalism and catastrophism in the media reporting on CC. Let me say up front that greenhouse gas emissions are hugely important, and almost no efforts to reduce them and shunt humanity to a decarbonized future are off the table for me.  So I;m not saying you shouldn't worry.  I'm saying your worrying makes you worse off and doesn't help at all.  

For transparency, I'm 39M, and felt much the same way you did at 20.  I was reading the Club of Rome report, Population Bomb, David Suzuki, and books like ""The Weather Makers"" and ""The Long Emergency"".  My life changed when a friend told me to read ""Ismael"" by Daniel Quinn, although it took a long time to unravel. In University I was studying anthropology, deep ecology and really trying to figure out the social levers we had to change the world.

At this point, I am much more relaxed and at peace.  I even have a child, which 20 year old me would never have though possible.  I am content that you and I are on a roller coaster ride we didn't ask for, but there's no getting off and the ride will kill us one day.  Sorry if that sounds fatalistic, but at this point, I frequently feel the need to laugh at the absurdity of it all.  

Here's my best case for why you should not let CC ruin your metal health.

1 - you are useless to the climate movement if you are a nervous wreck.  We need reasonably healthy, happy, and productive citizens to make the case to our fellow citizens that we actually do have a problem to deal with.  But screaming about having only 16 years left to prevent extinction (of humankind) is not helping.  Crying uncontrollably will not persuade anyone. I've done a bunch of carpentry in my life, and at first I would beat myself up with ever mistake. I could barely function, thinking I had just wasted this piece of wood which had traveled so far at such great cost to the earth.  But you know, to be good at anything, you will make mistakes, and you must learn to permit yourself those mistakes. After a while, I would cut a piece of wood, realize I had made a mistake and just cut another piece.  I set the mistake piece aside, and it always got used as scraps, and the world kept turning.  
 I guarantee you we are blowing past the 1.5 degree goals at this rate.  It's not the end of the world, only making things much harder. But we will take that mistake, examine it, learn from it, and use it for scraps later on.  

2 - The solutions are right there, but humans are hard to motivate.  On this topic, I highly recommend listening to Ezra Klein's podcast where he interviews Saul Griffith.  Saul makes the very good point that for too long we have given the microphone to climate scientists.  These folks are wonderful at speaking to their expertise, but they stumble when asked for solutions.  At this point in the debate, we need the engineers to come in and provide actual solutions.  Now, this is where I take heart.  Whatever plan for decarbonizing our economies you want to come up with, they are things we can debate, enact and finance.  These are tangible goals, and much of the 'catastrophizing' we see in the climate movement actually works against the engineering solutions at hand.  

For example, nuclear power seems to be a clear winner in the world to come.  It's compact, relatively safe, there's plenty of fuel, we know how to do it so we won't be waiting on some magic solution.  Our environmentalism should never blind us to this fact.  So much of the rhetoric from the enviro movement I grew up with poisoned me to nuclear power, because we weren't listening to the engineers.  In fact, environmentalism works much life a religion on this point, where faith and 'thuthiness' win out over distasteful conclusions of science. So keep a healthy skepticism

3 - It's really not so bad (unless we drive all the other species extinct).  During the course of human history, we have survive some pretty fucking apocalyptic moments.  Giant volcanoes, megafauna die offs, ice ages, plagues etc.  I'm not sure climate change even registers on the ""Existential risk"" scale, except, as I noted above, if we undermine the rest of the natural world so badly it collapses.  But that's not exactly a climate change problem so much as a sustainability and biodiversity problem.  The earth and humanity will survive climate change if it happens slowly enough and doesn't trigger multiple tipping points.  

And even if the worst happens, the death of humanity is not something you should lose any sleep over. As I said in point 1, you need to be healthy to make anything happen anyways, so don't stress.  Be stoic and steady, compassionate but clear-headed.  If the die is already cast, well, enjoy the roller coaster you are on.  

I often look at my daughter.  I imagine her life and I imagine my own death and her going on without me.  Life does go on. It's not fair to ask her to clean up the mess my parents and I are making, but she will have to.  I must be sane to raise a healthy sane person that can continue the work after I'm gone.

4 - Ignore the religious side of CC activism.  

Earlier, I mentioned Daniel Quinn who wrote ""Ishmael"".  He was a slow thinker.  He saw something most of us just can't see.  He talked about how every culture has a vision, and the culture follows this vision like a river following its course.  The are also programs, and programs are like sticks and rock we use to try to change the course of a river.  But sticks and rocks are shitty tools to change the course of a river.  Quinn saw we need an entirely new vision for civilization. This new vision would replace the old one we civilized folks have been living with for 12000 years now.  Everyone you know has been told at some point, that humans are fatally flawed and we are destined to bring this Eden crashing down.  We all know stories of Ragnarok, Armageddon, Judgement Day.  Our culture bathes in it, to the point where all three of those things I just listed are apocalyptic religious stories and very popular pop culture movie titles.  The idea that our days are numbered is enmeshed in this culture, so begin to recognize it when you see it and forgive yourself for falling prey to it.  

""The end of the world"" is the reason for much of the apathy you see, and the source of much of our cognitive dissonance.  What Quinn gave was a new vision.  And it's a little hokey, but bear with me.  He though a decent replacement for Armageddon was to see that Homo was not the only animal on earth heading towards greater intelligence and sonsciouness.  Many other mammals, at least, could have evolved the intelligence we value so highly.  He though humanity should set itself the goal of becoming the stewards of budding consciousness.  In 500 000 years, we will be unrecognizable, but if we make it, we may well have companions in the space of conscious thought.  I hope we do, in fact. 

Now this may not be a vision that works for you.  Maybe you want to live in some Spartan world where we live simple, honest lives without technology. Find some vision that does seem right to you, but don't ever think this world was meant to end with, or ever could be ended totally by, humanity.  We just aren't that important.  

Anyways, that was a lot.  I hope some of it helps.  I'm happy to follow up because I really do think the way we talk about CC is hurting more kids than helping them.  I have spent a bunch of time trying to unravel that knot you are on, and I'd say I've made some progress at least.  I certainly don't have it all, but I've spent lots of time listening to clever people.

If you only take one thing away from this, however, keep in mind that the news media does indeed want to have more bad news every day for you.

"g0c8kjf","This is a good argument against quotas across professions. Correct me if I'm wrong, but it sounds like you're saying that, since men and women are naturally more interested/inept in different types of professions (with men leaning towards more technical professions and women leaning towards people-oriented professions), quotas do nothing more than to force people into professions that they either would not naturally choose or would never be able to acheive on their own merits. My questions for this argument would be:

How are separating between technical barriers to a profession and cultural barriers? In the example you gave of Sweden, you mentioned a situation where all technical barriers for pursuing a career have been removed. But since we know culture plays a major role in how genders interpret their own role and strengths in society, is it not possible that attitudes towards what makes someone a man or woman were still at play in Sweden even after structural barriers were removed?

Another question of mine would be, if men and women only portray slight statistical differences on average, how does this translate to such stark segregation in professions that seems to exceed the statistical differences? (As a hypothetical example, if a psychology study shows that 60% of women have a high degree of social intelligence and compassion---qualities needed in nursing type work-- and only 40% of men, you could say that women are on average more socially intelligent and compassionate. But it also means that 40% of men portray these characteristics as well--not a small percentage at all. And yet, the number of male nurses is far below 40%.)  This is just one hypothetical example, but many professions are far more segregated than the actually psychology of men and women would predict. Could this not be a result of cultural influences? 

I'm reminded of the studies in which women are told before a test that it's ok if they don't do well, since women are typically worse at math. In the control group they were told nothing. The control group ends up having much higher scores on math than the other, simply because there was no cultural suggestion that they shouldn't get equal scores. Not only that, they end up having equal scores to men. Things like this make me wonder whether it should be culture that we target rather than simply quotas.

My final question would be, how do you feel about affirmative action or quotas related to race? I'm not sure about Australia, but in the U.S. a long history of racist policies has led to certain minority communities being prevented from social mobility, including education. Now that the policies have been removed, the communities are still impacted by the history and experience major social and economic barriers to education and jobs. Unlike gender, I don't think you can argue that different races have different natural inclinations. Many of the differences we see in behavior are due to structural and cultural factors. Do you support quotas in this type of environment to help these communities retrieve some of the cultural capital and wealth that was taken from the group as a whole? Or do you still prefer a meritocracy-based system in this context as well?",1596557253,"(as a hypothetical example, if a psychology study shows that 60% of women have a high degree of social intelligence and compassion---qualities needed in nursing type work-- and only 40% of men, you could say that women are on average more socially intelligent and compassionate.","intelligent and compassionate","compassionate",NA,FALSE,"socially intelligent and compassionate","intelligent",NA,"socially",0

"g09cy2x","I think it's helpful to be able to develop a feeling of safety with your therapist. And also find it non-threatening as what you talk about in there won't have social repercussions in your normal life unlike when you struggle with BPD in any other social context.

And this is your first session, but overall for you future, I've found it helpful to try and form a friendly bond with my therapist. They have rules medically that they're supposed to kind of keep a certain level of professional separation from there patients. (While still being kind, friendly, helpful, and compassionate). But I would offer you the lived experience advice that when you can have a therapist who really also cares about you on a personal level in addition to a professional level, it can be important, because the therapists that generally care are the ones who will go to bat for you in those reoccurring times of need.

The other thing I would add from lived experience is part of their job is to push you to help you push yourself to do the work of self discovery and making the improvements in your life you want and need but you can only do yourself. They're never there to be antagonistic or confrontational, they're there to first listen, respect what you have to say, and think upon what you have to say and how you feel, but later on also after getting to know you for who you are, to challenge you to do what you actually want to do for yourself, but may not yet know you need to do for yourself. So therapy can offer the first common function of being listened to, being heard, and being a place for you to vent. That is one basic aspect of most therapy, but later on it becomes more about them figuring out ways to help you to push to make the changes that will help you lead a happy, safe, functional life.

"g0758v1","Non-Christians go to hell.

I cannot believe in a God that is loving, forgiving, kind and then who says, ""Oh, sorry, member of (other religion), I know you were good and kind and compassionate, but because you didn't say, 'I believe *this* story,' you face eternal damnation.""

Simply put, a God that capricious and shallow is unworthy of worship ... and honestly, it's just fear porn to get people to convert.

I am a Unitarian Universalist ... I believe in a loving, kind, caring, compassionate God who knows what is in our hearts and wants to help us become our best selves and realize that our greatest destiny is to be more loving, more compassionate, and more forgiving.

My dogs taught me that. I loved my dogs (passed away a few years ago from old age) with all of my heart. And they did things they knew they weren't supposed to do, and then they'd do the ""guilt slouch"" when they got caught. And it got me thinking, the dogs are my kids ... would I want them in heaven with me? And despite the fact that they sometimes did things they shouldn't have, OF COURSE I wanted them with me for all eternity because I loved them with all of my heart.

So why is it that, I, a pretty flawed, ordinary human being have this potential for compassion and forgiveness, and yet organized religion tells us that our creator, God, doesn't have that level of compassion and forgiveness in his/her/its heart? Are religions really trying to say that we are more forgiving than God?

If they are saying that, either they are telling us God is unworthy of worship and cruel (unlikely in my view, considering how many beautiful, wonderful things there are in creation) or they are lying to us to get our mindless obedience. 

So, I believe in a loving, forgiving compassionate God -- I don't believe the universe is an *accident* of physics and chemistry and biology. I believe in a God full of love and forgiveness and compassion, who knows what is in our hearts and heals us and helps us realize a better way to be -- after all, I and all of us get our limited, flawed sense of empathy and compassion from the Creator. I think God knows our hearts, simple as that, and wants to help us be better because it is good for us and it makes us feel better and more loving. And whatever religious tradition we come from is irrelevant. Whatever flaws we have in our hearts, rather than eternal punishment, I believe in a God who educates, uplifts, heals us so we can be better in whatever existence goes beyond (or if we come back here in some form or another).

And Rabbi Jesus? Big fan for the most part. (Hard to know how much of the story we get now is authentic and how much is ret-con. After all, ""He who is without sin, cast the first stone."" Ret-con. Didn't exist in early drafts of the Gospels. But the principles of many of his teachings -- turn the other cheek, trying to heal and help the sick and the poor while shunning the selfish and self-important, the Good Samaritan parable, the idea that the ""least among you can be greater than me"" because he, too, realized that our best destiny is love compassion, forgiveness. Really like his style.) 

Smiting, apocalypse Revelations Jesus? ""Gays are going to hell"" Jesus? ""Let's support a President who puts kids in cages, let 150,000 Americans die of a preventable pandemic, and pays off porn stars while we throw donations to a megachurch pastor so he can have a private jet and multiple mansions"" Jesus? That guy seems kind of like a jerk.

To me,the difference between certain (or most) celebrities and you is the empathy level, or emotional intelligence.

"fzecuvr","Oh yeah I got the three sessions thing too. I got an extra one because of COVID/telehealth but I knew the limits lol. 

I do think the difference is probably that I knew what I wanted and advocated for it directly and powerfully. I wasn’t using them as my first line of help, I was solely using it as a crisis service. 

Coming into college, I knew I had past issues with an eating disorder so I made an appointment (right at the beginning of the semester when everyone does it lol rip) where I did have to wait a couple of weeks. It wasn’t urgent so it was fine, but that was also the problem with the appointment. It wasn’t super urgent, my life wasn’t in danger, it wasn’t tanking my academics, etc. So I got a referral list and a list of groups (neither of which I used) and that was that. in retrospect though, i have no idea what i wanted. due to my family and their views and the insurance situation, there was no way i could go to therapy. so what did i want from caps? i don’t know. if i had been more aware of the purpose of caps and what they do, i think i would have been better served. or if i had actually used things off the list. but i didn’t know what i wanted out of it and i didn’t know what to do with the resources and so i just walked away. 

I definitely think that experience embodies the more common visit that people have but I think it comes down to a couple factors. I don’t necessarily expect people to always have these. in a crisis situation, just go. if you’re going to any kind of therapy or psychological services in a non crisis situation, having these ready will make your experience much better imo. The thing about caps is that it’s time limited, so you won’t have as much time to explore these out like you might in 1-2 first therapy sessions. The good news is you don’t need a novel for any of them, but it helps people help you (wherever you get services):

1) have an idea of what an outcome looks like

(do you want to see a psychiatrist and consider medication for a long standing issue? are you having trouble managing academic stress and want some strategies for managing anxiety? do you want to be drinking less?)

2) advocate for yourself

(tell them what outcome you want, tell them if something they say seems realistic. if you can’t afford therapy with your normal insurance, ask them for sliding scale lists. be direct about that, it helps them too!)

3) know why you’re there

the best help I personally ever got was when I came in during a (fun but not fun lol) hypomanic episode that I realized was problematic, and I was directly trying to resolve that issue. I knew what was up, I knew what I wanted, and that made it happen much easier. Not everyone will know!! But even if you can walk in with the thoughts of “I’m dealing with a lot of anxiety around this class where I feel like I never know what’s coming next and I want to get some strategies for dealing with this so it’s not keeping me up at night or causing me intense stress” that is going to get you so much more than just saying “I’m anxious about school”. 

I do think it can be difficult because it’s largely the first time you’ll have to get help for yourself and no one else can get it for you (and for a lot of people, their first time needing help altogether). but i think sometimes the issue is that people don’t treat it like they would seeing a therapist or something similar. they try to bridge that gap but it’s always gonna be more effective for you if you can pin down what you want a bit and then they can say stuff like “oh we have this group on coping with anxiety, let’s try to get you in that” and give you specific therapist recommendations and resource recommendations.

"fze65am","I may differ from other responders here who advise you to tell your parents. That is your decision, and I won’t encourage you to tell them, or not tell them. In my humble opinion, it’s not about them.

I DO encourage you to seek therapy, preferably one with specializing in therapy for trauma of sexual abuse. 

Pros: They are impartial. They will not judge. You need not worry about their pain. You can express your feelings without fear of judgement. They will help you focus on YOU and your healing. 

Cons: cost if you’re not insured, getting over that initial fear, and possibly not clicking. You can switch therapists, though. 

I think your concern and focus on telling them can be better used if it is focused on healing you. Processing the healing of sexual abuse is well handled by specialists. Really. You can be angry without fear. You can be horrified without judgement. You can work through the shame and learn it wasn’t your fault. 


My first therapist was in college. I remembered the abuse when I became sexually active, and saw a compassionate but poorly qualified therapist who asked me who was taking care of me. Stupid. The abusers were. My siblings. She hadn’t a clue. I never went back. 

My next therapist, decades later, helped, and five years later I am so much better. I wish you well.

"fz6e343","New commenter here - You're assuming only one aspect of conservatism. There can be multiple motivations. You can be compassionate and protective. Many people mess that up, but it is possible. How the military is used by any given administration is a whole different story...  but the idea of wanting a very well funded military is not exclusive of being compassionate. 

But back to the original thread question, I think that the conservative mindset is largely **more optimistic of the individual** than the liberal mindset is - believing that people are responsible for doing the right thing *and* that more people will do the compassionate thing than not. They see people in their community working to make things better, and believe that it will get better through individual and outreach organization work. If it's happening here, then it must work elsewhere too.  

Liberals tend to believe that it's worth risking losing the current status quo for the chance of improving things. You can see it in the demographics - mid to upper socioeconomic class and uni educated, who can afford to lose ground, and the low socioeconomic folks who are in discriminated groups that have very little to lose and so much to gain. And they see untempered individualism gone wrong in how other parts of the community treats them, individuals hoarding, justice working against them, and outreach ignoring and passing them by. You can see why liberals, in general, believe that people will not be compassionate as a whole and require external forces to do so.

Both are right to some degree. Individuals on the small scale will tend to be good, but individuals will rarely be good for a long enough, strong enough duration to change things for people at a distance - that they can't see or don't know. 

For the record, I'm a liberal. Possibly moderate to middling liberal compared to most of the western world, but a flaming liberal compared to most of  Oklahoma. 

I think that people largely don't have the time or energy to do all the outreach that needs to be done and that the government has a better potential to accomplish redistribution and regulation in a public setting especially on national scale economic and social issues.

"fz1rdve","Just imagine prison....only better food and movies.  I have been in an EMU since Monday.  For me (although I have never been to prison)....its worse.  You are confined to a bed. An alarm goes off when you get out of or if you try to reach too far.  You aren't allowed to leave not just your bed, but not even your room.  You will have wires all over your brain, wires all over your chest and at least one of your fingers.  At least one i.v. that hopefully doesn't hurt and functions appropriately (I have one in both arms and 2 bruises from an attempt and one that hurt off the bat, but they wanted to keep it for awhile to minimize the poking and prodding)...not to mention the lovenox thigh shot (your belly is another option) to prevent blood clots.  

They pretty much cut your meds cold turkey...which makes you an emotional trainwreck.  There are constant noises and interruptions.  People in and out of your room like its a hallway.  If you have to use the restroom someone has come shut off the alarms, attach a belt, and accompany you to the bathroom wires and all (prob the main reason why I haven't shit since my Monday arrival...no one want an audience while taking a dump).  No showers.  No baths...and if you want to clean up/shave your pits/wash your ass there is always someone watching at your side.  You are being watched by minimum of 2 cameras with audio recording 24/7....so no nose picking or wedgie relieving and I should prob make an attempt at controlling my potty mouth. 

Most are gentle and compassionate, 
but some of the EEG techs can be rough and rip your hair out.  You end up looking like a mummy because they wrap all the wires attached to your scalp in gauze.  I am full of complaints.  For me I was hanging on to a sliver of hope that this whole epilepsy thing was temporary, an error or a mistake.  Until last night my EEGs here in the EMU were 100% normal (though I had 2 abnormal ones prior to becoming inpatient).  My epileptolgist was more realistic (he wouldn't rule out a miracle) but said that once the meds were out of my system we would hopefully see some activity...otherwise I was committed to being here til the middle of next week.  He was right and this morning I had 2 abnormal eegs followed by confusion and emotional upset (my seizures occur where memories and emotions happen).  Then when I took a nap this afternoon I had another focal.  So I got brought down for SPECT imaging to pin point the exact location.  We are starting a new med and once I am seizure free for 24 hours I will be sent down for another SPECT...they will put both together with the MRI and figure out where exactly the seizures are coming from in case I need to have surgery.  Almost 70% of patient with TLE become medication resistant.  I am not ready to have a chunk of my brain cut out, but if comes down to it I won't have to come back to this place for more torture.  Once seizure free for 24 hours after being on the meds I should be able to go home.  The hrdest part is that I miss my family, kids, and dog....my independence, my bed, etc.  

I would recommend bringing books/ipad/phone/switch (or hand held gaming device) crosswords etc.  The tv and movies only get you so far.  If he is picky like me, I brought a bg of snacks and things I like to eat.  Like candy/fruit roll ups/fruit cups/dark chocolate granola/granola bars/gummy bears/star bursts/apple cinnamon oatmeal/latte packets/instant mac n cheese etc. Bring all toiletries....baby wipes...meds....etc.  A robe works better than a button up (no over the head shirts d/t the wires and iv.s).  Comfy bottoms.  I gave up on undies by tuesday...why bother...socks...slippers...glasses...an eye mask has been a lifesaver.  I forgot a fan, but they were able to give me one to use that clips onto a guard rail...another lifesaver.  Bring all electrical cords needed for the devices you brought.

Because if selfishness and self-interest refers to  \*at the expense of others\* then it is clearly false for almost everybody because we can clearly be co-operative and compassionate.

But if selfishness and self-interest refer to the mere fact that we try to do whatever is in our interest and whatever we want \*even when our wants and interests line up with others who we care about\* then it is clearly true but trivially so---because it's a definition of 'selfishness' and 'self-interest' that ends up deeming even the most compassionate actions of all to be 'selfish' and 'self-interested'. Thereby making us all 'selfish' and 'self-interested' in a way that is kind of completely meaningless.

But even though the trivially true sense may seem completely meaningless from one angle: on the other hand, why should selfishness and self-interest have to necessarily be at the expense of others? After all, being self-interested just means being interested in one's self, right? It doesn't mean that one's self-interest can't include others. Can't we not be compassionate and treat others well for purely 'selfish' reasons?

1. ""Assault weapons"" bans are not practical. You can't make a gun more safe by giving it a non-adjustable stock or taking away the pistol grip. Also, trying to outlaw removable magazines didn't work at all in California, they very quickly invented technological work arounds to swap out mags without violating the statute.  Limiting magazine size is doable, but really scraping the bottom of the effectiveness barrel. Mag swaps are lightning fast with just a little practice. You can try to ban semi-automatic firearms, but that's unlikely to survive a constitutional challenge. Instead, pivot to taking funds away from cops and putting it back into social services, early intervention, and mental health.  Then have the cops stop doing those jobs. You'll save way more lives, kill fewer people who just had a bad day, and you'll probably make money in the long run because it's cheaper to help people early than fix them when they break (saying nothing about kindness and basic human decency).
2. People who go through puberty as a biological male should not compete athletically with people who go through puberty as  female, or who take testosterone in amounts considered normal for biological males.  They split men's and women's sports for a reason: 16 year-old-boys beat most women's Olympic teams. I have two biologically female daughters and I'd like them to have a shot at making the track team if that's what they want to do.

"fycl5t2","High cost of living isn’t just attributable to housing, although that’s a MAJOR part of it.

Bay Area has high cost of living because we keep voting to approve new taxes, higher taxes.  The extra tax is then baked into the higher cost of goods and services.  Stuff like groceries, gas, essentials that everyone needs but disproportionately impinges on the poor and middle class.

Take for example the soda tax that San Francisco voters passed in I think 2016.  It imposed a tax of 1 cent per ounce of all sugary drinks to be levied against distributors (like cocoa cola, Pepsi, etc).  That tax is then passed into supermarkets, grocery stores, convenient stores, restaurants, etc.  Since the measure did not require the tax to apply directly to the soda, supermarkets spread the extra cost around the entire store so it’s less noticeable than suddenly seeing a 20 cent increase on your soda.  Maybe your meat for more expensive, or maybe it was your product.  This essentially became a grocery tax, affecting people who don’t even drink soda.  Two years later, the state of California wanted to pass an additional 2 cent per ounce tax on sodas statewide.  I know it doesn’t sound like much but layer enough taxes on top of each other and it all starts to add up.  California approved a higher gas tax recently.  It’s now more expensive to drive to the store and buy groceries.  

All this nickel and diming by the state adds up and introduces a barrier to economic mobility and entrepreneurship for the lower classes.  How the hell could you possibly save up for a down payment on a house when you your income is taxed to hell before you ever see a dime of it, and then whatever you have left is taxed again and again — 2% groceries tax, 8% sales tax, crazy gas tax.  In the end, how much of your hard earned income did you split with the government without you even realizing it because you’re paying for taxes that are baked into your purchases in the form of higher cost of living. 

So you can’t buy a house and you’re forced to throw money in the toilet every month renting.  What if you want to start a business?  Well, there is a risk to starting businesses and before you are able to earn a single penny, you must first grease the wheels of your government yet again in the form of expensive business licenses and permits.  And then whatever you do make on your business you have to pay taxes on again before you can take your share.  Why do we make it so hard or impossible for lower income people to take risks starting businesses and taking a shot at achieving the American dream?

So we limit avenues for social mobility and poor people stay poor because they can’t afford to pay the government cartel for the privilege of taking a risk at improving their lot in life.

We need to start repealing taxes that present as barriers of entry to things like home ownerships and starting businesses.  In fact, let’s repeal taxes in general, starting with those idiotic groceries taxes masquerading as soda tax.  Then gas taxes.   Most permits are unnecessary (how is charging a restaurant a permit fee for having sidewalk dining even reasonable or fair?  It only imposes additional burdens on businesses, making it just much harder for them to stay afloat.

San Franciscans.  Bay Areans.  I know you guys love to be virtuous and compassionate, but please stop voting to increase taxes and bridge tolls and whatever just because they threw something in there to make it sound nice.  The people selling the SF soda tax at the time said the revenues would go to healthcare, yet the measure itself didn’t say that at all.  Instead the measure directed the revenues to the SF general fund, which means it’s free money for them — YOUR money — that the city can spend on things you didn’t approve and didn’t vote for that they will now mismanage haphazardly.  And when you’ve been finally been priced out of San Francisco and move to the east bay to save on rent, you guys vote to raise the bridge toll.  And people wonder why the middle class is shrinking to nothing in SF and the wealth gap between the rich and poor are widening.

In general she isn't very open about herself, despite always encouraging us to be. She will allude to her personal challenges but when you try to open up a conversation she becomes defensive and combative, when all you are trying to do is give her space to talk about what is bothering her. Several years ago I tried to express my concern for her over a specific issue and she took such offence to it that she didn't speak to me for months.

Biden might be old, no idea if he's senile. But I'd prefer that to someone who is obviously a moron. Someone who cannot make decisions that reach beyond his own narcisism. But I guess that has become the american norm. So people can relate.

"fybxpus","The value system is different than how we see it. Quidditch has some value but there seems to be a big disparity between hogwarts and professional teams so it’s like saying that they are on their high school JV team. Popularity is of who’s perception? Ron and Percy are openly mocked by the student body; Percy for being an unpersonable book worm and very self centered and Ron for having a little brother complex and always getting shown up. Charlie was also an outcast as he was seen as the “dragon kid”. The twins were funny but you always got the sense that they were very annoying and also never really stuck to much (dropped quidditch after 5th year, always hustling other students, skipping class). Bill was probably the model “popular” kid but how much impact does that have really? The only brothers to get great grades were Bill and Percy. The twins and Charlie were see as average and Ron did fine.

Ginny is a different story and I never mentioned it because I feel she does t fit with the weasley narrative and we never got the in depth background from Ron.

That is the assessment according to our muggle values. Remember wizards have different values.

The family was seen as compassionate but very expansive. They were not selective of their family or friends. They were quick to help someone in need. Because they values people they spent more and made less. The values of family honor, purity and net worth were out the window.

"fy9ml7k","I mean advice is usually absorbed better via a more compassionate avenue anyway. I have to admit I've even gotten heated when reading a few posts that seem unable to grasp basic consent or healthy relationship communication but that's something I feel reading posts on any relationship sub.

 What I worry about though with too much positivity, the not genuine type, the gassing you up ""Yasssssss u do U bby gorl!"" is that it can lead to an echo chamber.

 You get caught up in all of the people hyping you up for even bothering to ask what *might* be a legit damning admission just as much as you are getting the people asking for constructive advice only getting gassed up and that's not as helpful for them as a mixed honest comment base with some negative some positive according to the commenters free will. 

You can be encouraging and compassionate but also you can encounter things that trigger a fear or revulsion response and for me personally I'd rather not lie (to myself) as I'm giving my own personal feedback on someone's post.

Of course I 100% believe that everyone would have a more constructive time on reddit and the Polyamory subreddit if when we read comments we took a few seconds to process and relate what exactly about the comment is upsetting and just get away from that instant gratification dopamine rush just screaming ""NO UR WRONG. BYE"" at every post that makes you feel uncomfortable. 

I think the people with negative personal experiences with unethical poly or boundaries or anything really would benefit, from sharing about the experiences that broke them down to help people maybe just maybe not make the same mistakes or just hopefully try to influence them away from hurting people when they comment.

"fy99ofc","Hi kiddo... Sounds like a good ""down"" you're feeling, eh? ... Sucks. ... Buttah.... ..._&lt;shakes head&gt;_... can't always trust your feelings. Like, hmmm....sometimes we have a panic attack, the feeling of panic, but there's nothing to panic about. Doesn't make the feeling less sucky, but it does show us that just because we feel something, doesn't mean there's something real corresponding to it.

And now you ..._&lt;wags finger at you, quasi-correcting you&gt;_... you played two tricks here. Or your mind did. Your feelings.

One is almost funny. _Almost_. You wonder if you're good enough...and then you describe how you work hard, get good grades, stay out of trouble, try to power through your learning disorder, got into a program hard to get in, are kind and compassionate.... Hello? ..._&lt;smiles at you&gt;_... If your friend described someone like that, would you tell them not to associate with that person, that you think they suck, are borderline criminal? ..._&lt;shakes head&gt;_... no way! right? So...same applies to you.

Now the second trick your mind played on you is throwing everything, _everything_, into one ""am I good enough"" basket. That's not fair. How do you score something like that? If a person is kind and compassionate but impatient -- good, good enough, bad? If another person is kind, patient, but not compassionate -- how do we score them?

In truth, there are always things about us that are good, good enough, and some things that we need to work on, sometimes for the rest of our life. So, for example, I think both you and I find it good you're kind and compassionate. But, you flag that you see it as not so good that you sometimes ignore your own gut feeling about people. So that's something you don't find good enough. Doesn't make you as a whole person good or bad; it's just something you notice you don't agree with with yourself. So -- that's something to work on. 

But sweet kiddo ..._&lt;touches your arm&gt;_... this, this whole thing where you wonder ""am I doing good? am I good enough?"", _that_ is the sign you are good. Bad people don't think these things. They think they're perfect and everybody else around them is failing. When you're a good person inside, you think ""hmm, maybe I'm the problem?"", or you think ""I understand the other person didn't mean to do bad -- maybe they meant well"". Not saying that's always the case, and we have to be careful not to become doormats, but generally good folks have a tendency to think these things. That's you.

It's good, it's healthy, to wonder if you can improve, should improve. But be careful; our inner critical voice tends to talk like a jerk about us. When you have some time, [check this out](https://www.bakadesuyo.com/2019/10/how-to-be-happier-2/). Corny title, but has some good stuff about our inner critic.

Be kind and compassionate to yourself, the way you would be with a friend who comes with the same issues and doubts.

&gt; Am I good enough yet? 

Yes. You're the best You you can be at _this very moment_.

&gt; How do I become ~~good enough~~ better?

By following the path you do. Seeing what you think you want to be better at, and then practicing that.

&gt; Will I ever be ~~good enough~~ done?

No. It's incredibly hard for us humans to balance it all. If we have 5 things we need to keep in inner-balance, we succeed at 2, are so-so at the 3rd, and fail the other 2. Have one thing in balance? All of a sudden we find the other thing isn't. And sometimes we just don't know; was I being impatient with this person, or were they really just being a jerk and I was justified to get upset with them?

You'll be working on yourself until the very last end. You'll do so by intuition, and by standing on the shoulders of giants, learning from those who went before us. And in turn, those whose lives you crossed, and touched, will learn from you, and they will stand on your shoulders, and try to improve their path. And you, kiddo....you're already delivering an awesome contribution.

I'm proud of you.

We haven’t been able to agree on much since this conversation started. 
The love of God is so big I’m certain He will make sin impossible to achieve, but at that time it will be forced into its place, almost like a lying mouth being removed of its tongue, or an overly sexually active person being removed of there sex organs and having to go to the bathroom out of the same whole they ate with, God lobes is far and wide, same as His mercy, but let us not forget that He is also a God who destroys even to this day His anger is displayed through tornadoes and floods, lives are being lost and destroyed right in front of a God who is capable of saving, that is not being as one, we sometimes choose hellish lives, but there are many that don’t choose, yet are forced in, and if we were one there would be no reason to repent, right?

"fy5zfle","&gt;Yes there is corruption everywhere, but when someone like trump can do it in the open, and nothing can be done about that is a big problem that needs fixing. 


&gt;There is racism man, 

I didnt say there wasn't, but the real severity is considerably less than what you would think from the media.  We are the only country in history where white people fought white people to free slaves.  If this was a truly racist country a black man would not have been elected.

&gt;There reason I never visited US and not going to, at least now, is because an average American is gonna call me Chinese, they gonna call any Asian face Chinese due to their ignorance and lack of education.

How could you possibly know that if you've never been there? Again, this what you're inferring from media and reddit. And if reddit is your basis on how people should behave... yea you will have a warped perspective of reality.  Everytime I've gone overseas I've been called British.  Should I be upset that they didnt know better?


&gt;Apart from media, it’s that US was world “leader” and they think they are better than everyone else because of that. 

Do you know we've had more than one president and that American exceptionalism has been apart of the culture for a long time?

&gt;Defunding police might not be right, but restructuring their budget, so that a bigger share goes into education is a right way to go. 

I agreed that more training is always better

&gt;How many people were put away for mj possession and how many of those cases were fabricated by police? 

Many were because it's against the law.  And while I dont agree with the law you cannot blame the police for enforcing the law.  They dont create the law.  I hope it changes and it's starting to, but it takes time.

&gt;How many times policeman turned off their body cams? 

Less than you think.  A dozen videos of police is NOTHING compared to total number of interactions.

There are 100,000+ police interactions every year and a fraction of a fraction end in a fatality.


&gt;How many times people were killed by police on basis of personal reasons?

Less than 0.1% of the time


&gt;The problem is some of policemen are high school bullies who are looking for power to continue bullying in legal way.

Some.  Key word.  Some.  It's one of the hardest and most dangerous jobs you can have so it's no surprise you dont always get the best employees.  But despite that, only a tiny fraction of people are killed by police.


&gt;but I think there should be none.

I think there should be no cancer or murder or car accidents to, but you cant make policy based on the 100% perfect, ideal situation.  It must be based in reality. 

&gt;Public servants shouldn’t be biased. 

Ideally, but this a human problem, not anything you can legislate.  Show me how you make a human being non-tribal and I will show you how to fix the world's problems.

&gt;You mentioned that black people are more likely to commit crime and gave a father reason. But what if we look in the past? Black pepper were historically oppressed. They were denied same equal rights for let’s say education. Education is what will help bring this crime rate lower among blacks, but is being done to help them?

So I just want to make you aware that you've called Americans ignorant and gave your two cents on the matter, but you have no clue the number of programs available to help specifically black people and minorities generally.

Affirmative action is a huge one and some of these policies have been around as early as the 60's

A black person needs LESS points on their SAT to gain admission to Harvard while Asian applicants require more.

Black scholarships and schools exist only for people of that descent. 


&gt;I’m sure richest country in the world can fund a decent all inclusive education for minorities and for poor people and also raise their standard of living. 

Detroit pays more money per student than any other city and yet they have one of the highest dropout and incarceration rates.  Money to pay for education is not the issue.

&gt;Some people don’t have a choice rather than to go criminal. 

Yes, that's what I said.

&gt;The society already thinks if he’s poor and black he will become a criminal before the person actually does.

Maybe you do, but I don't.  And most people here don't either, but that doesn't help when you have such a disproportionate amount crime being committed.

Coincidentally, if you look at the numbers, as single motherhood began to rise so did crime about 15-20 years later.


&gt;With that hatred what else that person can do except to crime rate.

The only hatred here is yours

&gt;You mentioned excellent ideas, bring opportunities to poor people, bring businesses, bring education. That’s what also needs to be fixed. 

Yes.  Unity is the best fix.  But saying ""racism"" is the problem shifts the cause to the other.  There are things all groups should work on.  If you say its ""only"" the police's fault you absolve black people of also making choices that affect them.  

&gt;I can provide you proof for racism, I will try to find what I’ve seen for the past couple months if you desire

Again, I didnt say racism doesn't exist, but it's not the problem at large in the US. Every country has racism.  This is another human problem.  In the US it's all but a thing of the past when you compare it to countries with open hatred against certain groups.

&gt;Anyway it’s nice discussing with you as things don’t get personal like with many rednecks here on Reddit

Listen, reddit is the worst place to try to gauge what real people are like.  Most people are kind and compassionate, but anonymity brings out the worst in people.  You look at Twitter and there are people harassing a young girl whose father died because he was a cop.  That is not progressive.  That is not compassion.  That is people being tribally driven hidden by the internet.

I believe most people are inherently good, but I'm watching as people from both sides become venomous.  Racism was nearly solved a few decades ago in the US, but racism gets good ratings so it's not surprising that's all we see when the reality is the opposite.  Dont trust corporate media.

My dad was abusive towards me growing up and I was terrified of him. Throughout the years, I let it go and moved on, and him and I are okay now. I'm very close to my mother. She is my best friend. I was born on her 28th birthday. She has apologized for her role in my suffering as a child, he has not. 

I'm also very introverted. Having a 12th house sun conjunction to the Ascendant can bring unwanted attention. I feel like I'm in the spotlight all the time and I can't stand it. I also have a stellium in my 1st house (Mercury, Neptune, Jupiter). Anyway, I hate the attention I get. I want to hide away. I don't like that people are so curious about me and want to get close. I don't have difficulty making friends, but I'd rather people leave me the F alone because I really, *really* don't like people. People are mostly selfish and terrible; friendships are overrated.  Too many toxic people and bullies in this world. I love quarantine so much because I don't have to see or be around people anymore. I don't like the suffering and pain COVID has brought to the world, but I'm thankful to be able to hide away with no one bothering me. 

Anyway, as others have said, you have to accept yourself for who you are. Being an introvert is a good thing, IMO. I feel introverts are strong in that we have learned to fend for ourselves.

Then she went to Robert, who was subsequently killed by tess. Even Tess and Joel point out that they were probably the among the Fireflies’ last option.

On point 2 i do agree with you.

Om point 3 i do not however. Marlene stated herself that they were planting on leaving the city, and the military tried to rile them up to have a scapegoat for their problems. Hence the the bombing during the first sequence of the game.

On point 4 you are completely right, and it is a point of debate. Still, the fact that the game chooses to show you this is telling. The subplot portrays them as idealistic and compassionate, but also short sighted and foolish. The writers could have put something that shone a more positive light on the Fireflies, but they chose not to.

"fxkeczz","Sounds like you are still holding onto a lot of things and letting them continue to stunt your progress. You've stopped the drinking, but perhaps haven't addressed the underlying issues and resentments.  You said you attend AA meetings,but have you done the steps with a sponsor? Working steps 4 through 12 are important and helpful to help get rid of the baggage you are carrying.  The past is no longer relevant.  There is only now and moving forward.  Holding on to past mistakes and resentments are not useful anymore. 

If you are reluctant to do the steps,therapy may be another option. Making sober connections is also helpful.  It relieves the isolation and gives you the opportunity to feel connected with others who understand what you are going through. 

Serenity comes with taking action and finding ways to live in the now. And getting rid of old patterns of thinking and morbid reflection.  Beating yourself up for past issues will not help with serenity. Learn to be kind to yourself and know that you are not that person in the past. 

I can relate to feeling lost and not knowing what I want or who I am. I had to start from scratch.  I have been able to rebuild myself and my life to where it is more calm, joyful, and compassionate.

* spent a short period of time with my birth father over the course of a few weeks before he passed due to a degenerative illness
* had a financial shift (see above)
* lost the partner I started dating in the Fall - he was supportive right up until a few days after the death then acted like an amnesiac who was told he had a relationship with me until I got up the courage to end it
* thought I was ready to build a relationship with someone else this spring but he realized he wasn't ready - we haven't talked since, although he wanted to stay in touch. I hope to one day reconnect as friends once I've had enough time and space to be able to see him that way, we had a very healthy connection (no red flags!)
* ended things with the male therapist I was seeing last fall who I didn't like (with an excuse)
* tried to see my fav therapist virtually but couldn't get behind the idea of seeing her on video when I was so used to sessions in person
* made an attempt at cheap therapy to ""get through COVID"", saw a bunch of red flags, and ended things with a polite, firm email - no excuses this time!
* finally felt ready to seek real change through therapy and after a false start, found a therapist I really like who is open and compassionate, but am struggling to do the work due to COVID

The reality that my dad (who was ""unintentionally"" abusive) will never impact my life again have given me a sense of security I thought I'd never feel (the shift in finances doesn't hurt either). I also feel more confident at work than I did in the fall as I've continued to grow in my career.

1. Of course downtown revitalization, although I'm not sure how deep this can lump into one ""idea"". Build something of relevance on some of these Lenny's Lots, slap a coat of light gray paint on the Hyatt, finish the Laura Street Trio, build out the abandoned buildings in downtown (JEA, Ambassador, etc), turn the Landing into a daily food truck gathering spot with some docks extending out, put a nice mural on the side of the CSX building, the list goes on.
2. Extend the Skyway. Nothing insane like going to the airport or Town Center, but going to the Stadium, Five Points area, Springfield, and into the heart of San Marco would be incredible for downtown revitalization. Along with this, a coat of paint and some cleanup and updates to the stations would be pretty great.
3. Agree with /u/Jdus1111111 that at least the downtown and San Marco areas need to be more pedestrian friendly. Shut down Five Points to vehicles and put up a parking garage somewhere close instead. Do the same for the busy parts of King Street, as well as St. Johns Ave where the Avondale Shoppes and San Marco where all the shops are.
4. Deal with the homelessness problem. Don't cluster all the shelters in the same area, provide better housing options and mental health assistance.

"fx6l3r4","Trying to tell everyone this.  That’s a bad therapist for you. 

The best approach is to find 3+ therapists you’re confident you might match with and ask for a free consult.  Some will give you the first hour free, some will give you 20 minutes.  After meeting the 3, if any of them feel good (or if they feel not good in the right way - I.e. sometimes therapy is like muck taking), then schedule paid sessions.   If after a few weeks - pick a number, 7 sessions? - you don’t feel like it’s moving forward than rinse and repeat.  

I used to hate the risk of having to “find another therapist after 2 months” if one didn’t work out and it defeated me.  I didn’t go to therapy.  

But, you can take it into your own hands.  Tell them up front you’d like to schedule a consult to see if you’re a fit and you’re planning on seeing other people.   Kinda like a first date w/ a girl.  

You absolutely want someone who is warm and compassionate, but losing their composure or not being able to stay detached from your problems is a red flag in the long term.  A session here or there is ok - or if they ask you to stop because they can’t take it.   They’re human and you should be compassionate too.  It’s good they have emotions.

"fwyfde1","I have left not one but two jobs without having anything lined up! 

My first job out of college was as a first-grade teacher in a low-income school district. On top of the challenges of the first couple years of teaching and the intense needs of my students, my principal was manipulative and downright mean. I didn't have the emotional maturity to stand up to her or ignore her tactics. After 2 years, I resigned. I enjoyed my summer (no worries about income because our pay calendar ran through the summer).

That summer, I had already lined up jobs tutoring and nannying. My summer was full, and my routine didn't change all that much. 

In August, I started looking for another teaching job and was hired in a different district within 2 weeks. I loved that job, and was promoted into my dream job 2 years later but by 2018 I had stretched myself too thin and was burnt out to the core.

The first time that I quit without a plan in 2016, I just kind of went on with my life. The second time I quit without a plan in 2018, I realized I needed to do things differently or risk falling into a cycle of work myself to death/quit/rest/work myself to death/quit/rest/and on and on. Thankfully, I had been saving most of my income for a down payment for a house, so I had a lot of cash to work with.

This time around, I was out of work for over half a year. The first two months were spent traveling around Europe with my boyfriend (whose job is all remote, so he has the flexibility to travel).

The rest of the summer and fall, I spent my mornings reading books and drinking coffee on my back porch, or catching up on yardwork that I'd neglected for years. In the afternoons I'd visit friends and family, go for walks, cook, bake, clean, explore local parks, visit museums. I slept 10 hours a night, and finally caught up on the severe sleep deficit I'd acquired. I became a go-to helper for my friends who wanted a few minutes away from their kids, or for older neighbors who needed help with errands...that was truly my biggest gift and the thing I miss the most about being home full time. Most importantly, I saw my therapist once or twice a week. 

One piece of compassionate but tough insight for anyone who feels the need to leave a job suddenly...you got here because somewhere along the line, you either made a wrong decision about a job, or didn't stand up for yourself, or didn't take care of yourself (even if you thought you were doing everything right!). The problem was not your boss, or the job itself, or anything external. It's prudent to admit that you are not the victim of your circumstances. When you are at your best, you can handle anything!

The feeling of needing to leave your job even if there was nothing lined up, that's your spirit giving you a message that something isn't working. There are changes you need to make. I don't know what those things are. But the things that need to change might not be what you think!

To identify what changes you need to make, be mindful of what you are thinking and feeling while you're not working. If you think you ""need to"" keep yourself on a schedule, then you should evaluate WHY you feel that way. If you think you ""must"" incorporate working out, or job hunting, or house projects, or any other commitments...discuss with a therapist WHY those things feel important. There is no better time to evaluate your thought processes, habits and deep feelings than right now!

I learned that my priorities, while well-intentioned, had been misguided. Things that seemed healthy and good from the outside were actually harmful in the long run. I tended to create pressure for myself when what I really needed was to let go. When I first quit in 2018, I was rigid about keeping a schedule, but then realized that I use scheduling to gain a sense of control rather than as a tool that creates more time for things I love. I used the mask of ""being a realist"" to cover up my fears of never being truly happy or satisfied. I used the shield of ""demanding excellence at work"" to hide the fact that I thought I would be abandoned if I wasn't good enough. Things I THOUGHT I was doing right, were actually causing me harm.

I guess what I'm saying is...what you think you need right now might actually just be reinforcing old habits; the same habits that have led you here. Don't just do things because you think you should! Now is the time to 1) do what you want to do without guilt and 2) develop healthy habits that will actually serve you in the long run.

When my self titled ""season of self care"" ended, it was because I felt ready. I thought I'd take maybe a month or two off...but it ended up being closer to 7! Even with the resume gap, I hopped online and found a new job I love within a week or two. I interviewed with 3 prospective employers and they were all very receptive to my explanation of ""traveling abroad and taking care of personal matters at home."" Looking back at my decisions to leave those jobs...I am proud. Not just proud of the decision to leave, but of the ways I was able to improve my life after I left.

Did we have to make sacrifices in order for me to take that much time away from work? Of course. But my boyfriend, family and friends were understanding and supportive. I hope the same is true for you...that your tribe is behind you, cheering you on as you take care of yourself!",1593910363,"one piece of compassionate but tough insight for anyone who feels the need to leave a job suddenly...you got here because somewhere along the line, you either made a wrong decision about a job, or didn't stand up for yourself, or didn't take care of yourself (even if you thought you were doing everything right!).","compassionate but tough","compassionate","but",FALSE,"compassionate but tough","tough",NA,NA,1

"fwtceum","The trick is of course in the execution of the defense.

First off, Sheloran and Baxlon would have to make a few connections that we as the reader (and author) know.

First, that there was a definite overdose of a very very potent psychoactive compound.  If there is an effect, it wasn't obvious nor was it immediate.  IF they could make a good causal link between the ""malpractice"" committed by the state and her subsequent condition that COULD definitely be something to work with.

Conversely, it could also be used to demonstrate mental incapacity of a more permanent nature.  That could be BAD, really bad.  Not that Sheloran would be mistreated, far from it, but if it was determined that her current very dangerous mental state was a result of mistreatment by the state, then she would be given gentle, truly compassionate, but also PERMANENT RESIDENTIAL treatment.

It would be a very pleasant, nurturing, but very real cage.

There is one thing to bear in mind.  We aren't Terrans.  The Terrans are humans who have gone through some truly transformative disasters cultural upheavals and restructuring.  

We share their genes but not their culture nor their psyche.  One can even argue that thanks to epigenetics they differ from us even more than that.  They are a lot more ""feral"" in a way.  Now that Sheloran has said what she said, ""backing away"" from it or trying to ""diffuse"" her ""confession"" might not be the best thing to do from a tactical standpoint.  ""Yeah, I fucking killed them and let me tell you why..."" resonates a lot more strongly with the Terrans and trying to back away from that statement might be a good move in a bench trial but is the exact wrong move to make in a *Terran* jury trial.  

From a Terran jury trial standpoint her basically laying out her case and then shouting ""Fuck the Republic and Fuck you too!"" was a brilliant move!  After laying out the facts of the matter and yelling that, the crowd went wild!  They fucking loved it!  It is flooding the internet and has gone beyond viral!  Every single Terran will likely hear her shout that within 24 hours...

And it will be quite well received among a lot of people, of course not all of them, but a lot of them.  She looked like a pure badass, something that most Terrans will respect, possibly even admire.  Couple that with her rendition of O Fortuna, and some footage of her opening a little amphibian can of whoop-ass and you got one helluva news story!...

Something that Baxlon knows quite well and intends to play upon.  

Will it be ""enough""?  In and of itself, probably not.  It's the sort of thing that would get her sent to prison with a standing ovation.  Is she completely ""doomed""?  Nope.  Not completely.  There is a reason that Judge Dredd loathes Baxlon.  There is just enough of a crack in the case for him to work with.  

Also, Judge Dredd is deeply affected by this case and even if there is a jury involved... he's making mistakes, ones he wouldn't normally make.  This is *personal* for him for some reason.  He really should recuse himself because he's vulnerable and an aquatic predator like Sheloran's lawyer can smell blood in the water from a mile away.  Judge Carter so much as blinks and Baxlon will be on him fang and barb.

Baxlon plays dirty.  This sort of murky shit is what he lives for.  

One thing is for certain.  The facts of the case and the law are against Sheloran so Baxlon isn't going to be debating this one in anything close to a fair or even remotely ethical manner.  Baxlon will go right up to the razor's edge of getting into legal trouble himself on this one.",1593791634,"not that sheloran would be mistreated, far from it, but if it was determined that her current very dangerous mental state was a result of mistreatment by the state, then she would be given gentle, truly compassionate, but also permanent residential treatment.","compassionate, but also","compassionate","but",TRUE,"truly compassionate , but also permanent","permanent","truly","also",1

"fwa3yf7","I don't think he will be a different person, no. I do like how he developed so far, though. He came from being a naive guy with little experience, who agonized over hurting others, to a still very compassionate, but more rational young man, who understands that the world isn't just sunshine and rainbows even if he doesn't like it. I think that the core trio of Rak, Bam, and Khun really have great interaction and teach each other a lot. 

Khun learns to be a better, less selfish person who cares about his friends and stops acting out of pure self-interest. He still stays a rather morally gray character, but he came a really long way so far and I really want to see where his journey will take him.

Bam, as described above, learns the valuable lesson that if he wants to keep and protect what he loves, he will have to defend it from others at times, and that he needs to prioritize things. He also learned to let go of his obssesion for Rachel, which was really good for his mental health in my eyes. He's also essentially on a journey to discover himself, so there's a lot of potential for development still present.

Rak seems to develop the least, but he, too, learns to cherish others and becomes a less self-centered person in the process, with goals beyond just 'hunting the most worthy pray'.

Because so far, she never even explained what cbt actually is.

It feels like I'm doing some school exam.

"fw47o0t","I happen to know a little bit about what is going on at least in one hospital.

This extra money that is flowing through is (1) going to help with a ward rebuild (2) help employ more community psychiatric nurses (3) actually flowing into some extra social services.

This is going to take YEARS. This money cannot magic up buildings overnight, nor get nurses trained overnight, nor create services where there is none, so do not expect to see a sudden improvement in things over years ( Jacinda Arden is kind and compassionate, but she cannot summon psychiatrist or psych nurses from the underworld ).

Also remember there is currently a global shortage of psychiatrist. Most countries do not renumerate psychiatrist well, and countries that do end up with all the psychiatrist. NZ just happens to be one of the few countries where there is a great need for psychiatrist but we have failed thus far to renumerate them well, and due to the presence of Australia next door it acts like a magnet to suck them all across the ditch. 

NZ is going to to have to move from a low base to a high base ... and this will take years.",1593215223,"this money cannot magic up buildings overnight, nor get nurses trained overnight, nor create services where there is none, so do not expect to see a sudden improvement in things over years ( jacinda arden is kind and compassionate, but she cannot summon psychiatrist or psych nurses from the underworld ).","kind and compassionate","compassionate",NA,FALSE,"kind and compassionate","kind",NA,NA,0
"fvyst37","Not going to suggest you are anything but correct. I am an instructor, writer, narrator, professional filmmaker, and animator (40 years in the biz) and find the video content for go, for the most part, as you say, ultra-blah and heavily weighted toward single kyus and higher. But I understand these are made by folks who feel they have something to share. They are not trained to produce compelling content for effective instruction, especially not instruction that is focused on beginners and those who are slowly advancing toward 10kyu (Yes, there are some nice videos out there, just not many and they are poorly produced: terrible audio, bad lighting, complex marterial that is presented too quickly, narratives that are poorly scripted—if at all—and horrible graphics; all stuff from compassionate but totally untrained amateurs.) We all have our callings; I am not able to play go at their level — I do not aspire to that goal — and they do not have my decades of video production experience.

I wish to point out, however, except for the addition of media, the present situation is not new. Go enthusiasts in the west have suffered this dearth of go material for 100 years. Our only resources for decades were translated or co-written books based on works of Japanese professionals. I owned entire series of wonderfully incomprehensible books from Ishi Press because I hoped someday I would awake from dreaming about go, crack the secret code, and appreciate the treasures within those books. I sold them all to a go club someplace in the Midwest and I hope their members read them till they fell apart. 

My usual suggestion for frustrated go players is to locate your local go club and ask around to find a willing and capable teacher—not a simple task in these days of The Madness. Play dozens of conversational games for the enjoyment, not the competition. AFter a hundred fun games you will be able to find your fighting style. You could find a competent teacher in one of the discord groups. Don’t like their style? Dump them and find another. Yet another way to enjoy playing is to find someone a few stones weaker and help them along with patience and compassion.

Learning to play go well is worth the investment in time and effort. Accepting your limitations is important to enjoying the game. Look, the problem with getting better is just as you think you can play, you suddenly understand that, compared to dan-level players, there is an entire universe of go yet to be discovered. From what I have heard from dan+, it just gets harder.",1593101383,"they are not trained to produce compelling content for effective instruction, especially not instruction that is focused on beginners and those who are slowly advancing toward 10kyu (yes, there are some nice videos out there, just not many and they are poorly produced: terrible audio, bad lighting, complex marterial that is presented too quickly, narratives that are poorly scripted—if at all—and horrible graphics; all stuff from compassionate but totally untrained amateurs.)","compassionate but totally","compassionate","but",FALSE,"compassionate but totally untrained","untrained",NA,"totally",1
"fvxc0a7","No, it doesn’t necessarily mean she’s going to resort to that. Even if she does, as messed up as it is to say this, you have no real control over this  and it’s not going to kill her. If she was really suicidal she would have attempted by now. Does she live alone? If not then at least someone’s there to confirm if she’s alive or dead. 

You have to treat people with mental illness to some degree just like anyone else: be honest and say you have to distance yourself from her because she’s not seeking help and it’s now affecting your mental health too much and the behavior that’s going on is really unhealthy. Urge her to seek help and that if she wants you to take her to her first appointment then do so. But you need to set boundaries and explain why you’re setting the boundaries. Be compassionate but firm and just say you guys can’t have a proper friendship if she continues like this :/ it’s sad but the truth. 

You could also just distance yourself from her without going through all of that which is what I did and he turned out fine. Some people just need to grow up and being forced to be on your own for a certain time can do that. She will seek out other people as well. She’s a big girl.

"fvx6ws3","Hello guys :) here is another pick a crystal reading!! how can I open my heart up and be more compassionate?

We have 4 crystals today 

Crystal 1- pyrite 

Crystal 2- citrine 

Crystal 3- I call it my kidney crystal please feel free to comment the name below if you know it

Crystal 4- no idea, green blue crystal that reminds me of a beautiful marine scene 

Alright so todays question is going to be how can I open my heart up and be more compassionate? 

I have been sensing a lot of negativity In the energy lately, and perhaps its just me and where I am but either way karma is karma and I thought helping others open up their hearts will perhaps create a chain reaction. 

How do I do this? Close your eyes and meditate for a few minutes, get your mind a tad bit calm and then open your eyes looking at the picture, which one pops out the most? Thats your dude or perhaps you closed your eyes and you pictures a number 1-4 pick that one :) Goodluck and I would love to hear in the comments what you think. 

As always if you are drawn to me, please feel free to chat me and ask about my detailed readings. 

Crystal 1- though your goals, it seems as If you have a birds eye view on what you want to do next and where you want to go, in fact you might be so organized that you know exactly where and how you are going to reach this goal, but this energy comes with a kind of royalty vibe to it, you want to be treated like queen/king and love sitting high and mighty on your throne perhaps why you are at times perceived as volatile if something goes wrong, don’t fret, don’t be afraid and don’t let it get to you, things go wrong. I am thinking that you need some kind of meditative adventure for yourself to get your mind clear, that will help you balance out your heart charka very much! 

As always if you are drawn to me, please feel free to chat me and ask about my detailed readings.

Crystal 2- you are submerged in some kind of give and take, where you are unsure what to do, what is best for you might not be best for someone else and vice versa, I feel as if some of your relationships have been commanding where to go and what to do next, and I feel like that is not the best thing for you, you may be wearing yourself thin, it however does seem like there is a new opportunity waiting for you, and perhaps now is the right time to jump on the band wagon, has this been something you have been dreaming of and wanting for a while? Being able to take care of yourself will help you be able to be more compassionate to others, if you feel stuck take this new opportunity and explore your horizons. 

As always if you are drawn to me, please feel free to chat me and ask about my detailed readings.

Crystal 3- is there something that you are running away from? Perhaps your passion? It seems as if there is something that you are trying to keep under warps for some reason and you are unable to face it, it may be causing you some kind of emotional turmoil which is hindering your ability to grow and open up that beautiful heart charka of yours. In order for you to open up and be able to face this, you gotta follow your passions, you have this burning desire this fire underneath you and you need to let it burn, you have to do what makes you happy, and soon the healing will start, much love. 

As always if you are drawn to me, please feel free to chat me and ask about my detailed readings.

Crystal 4- there is inner conflict, outer conflict, job conflict, family conflict, I just see a bunch of conflict in your life right and left and that is taking a toll and our ability to be able to be compassionate and warm. Welp, the cards advice? BREATHE you got this, not everyone is always going to agree to everything and that isn’t even an issue, you cannot control what others think what others do, its ok to be yourself and be unique when people have an issue with something that you are doing, or did sometimes its not even because you did anything wrong, but because they have a void inside of them and cannot be on your level so instead they try and tear you down, and thats their issues, you cannot heal them you can only wish healing on them. But you need to BREATHE and let it go, they aren’t going to change, but you can and thats your power. thats how you get to be compassionate but accepting others as they are, trying to understand where they come from, but sometimes its too much and you gotta just let them go. Surround yourself with people who understand you and your vision. That will open up your heart to people who don’t it will help you feel fullfilled. Much love &lt;3

How do I do this? Close your eyes and meditate for a few minutes, get your mind a tad bit calm and then open your eyes looking at the picture, which one pops out the most? Thats your dude or perhaps you closed your eyes and you pictures a number 1-4 pick that one :) Goodluck and I would love to hear in the comments what you think. 

As always if you are drawn to me, please feel free to chat me and ask about my detailed readings. 

Crystal 1- though your goals, it seems as If you have a birds eye view on what you want to do next and where you want to go, in fact you might be so organized that you know exactly where and how you are going to reach this goal, but this energy comes with a kind of royalty vibe to it, you want to be treated like queen/king and love sitting high and mighty on your throne perhaps why you are at times perceived as volatile if something goes wrong, don’t fret, don’t be afraid and don’t let it get to you, things go wrong. I am thinking that you need some kind of meditative adventure for yourself to get your mind clear, that will help you balance out your heart charka very much! 

As always if you are drawn to me, please feel free to chat me and ask about my detailed readings.

Crystal 2- you are submerged in some kind of give and take, where you are unsure what to do, what is best for you might not be best for someone else and vice versa, I feel as if some of your relationships have been commanding where to go and what to do next, and I feel like that is not the best thing for you, you may be wearing yourself thin, it however does seem like there is a new opportunity waiting for you, and perhaps now is the right time to jump on the band wagon, has this been something you have been dreaming of and wanting for a while? Being able to take care of yourself will help you be able to be more compassionate to others, if you feel stuck take this new opportunity and explore your horizons. 

As always if you are drawn to me, please feel free to chat me and ask about my detailed readings.

Crystal 3- is there something that you are running away from? Perhaps your passion? It seems as if there is something that you are trying to keep under warps for some reason and you are unable to face it, it may be causing you some kind of emotional turmoil which is hindering your ability to grow and open up that beautiful heart charka of yours. In order for you to open up and be able to face this, you gotta follow your passions, you have this burning desire this fire underneath you and you need to let it burn, you have to do what makes you happy, and soon the healing will start, much love. 

As always if you are drawn to me, please feel free to chat me and ask about my detailed readings.

Crystal 4- there is inner conflict, outer conflict, job conflict, family conflict, I just see a bunch of conflict in your life right and left and that is taking a toll and our ability to be able to be compassionate and warm. Welp, the cards advice? BREATHE you got this, not everyone is always going to agree to everything and that isn’t even an issue, you cannot control what others think what others do, its ok to be yourself and be unique when people have an issue with something that you are doing, or did sometimes its not even because you did anything wrong, but because they have a void inside of them and cannot be on your level so instead they try and tear you down, and thats their issues, you cannot heal them you can only wish healing on them. But you need to BREATHE and let it go, they aren’t going to change, but you can and thats your power. thats how you get to be compassionate but accepting others as they are, trying to understand where they come from, but sometimes its too much and you gotta just let them go. Surround yourself with people who understand you and your vision. That will open up your heart to people who don’t it will help you feel fullfilled. Much love &lt;3

"fvwucjz","I get where you're coming from but...

&gt; These women are providing and have provided various amounts of evidence to support their accusations.

They have, and in return some of the accused have come back to provide MORE evidence and MORE context which would suggest their innocence.

That's why you don't just take any piece of evidence and scream ""HE DID IT"".

You can take accusations seriously without believing it the first chance you get.

And there have been plenty of accusations where the only thing they've provided is their account of events, and in that case, the guy is right, what else can he do but not really take it seriously? He's not going to jump out and decide X is a rapist because someone said so, he doesn't know either of them, he doesn't know anyone they know, he's so detached he has nothing to go on.

That's what I think hes saying. So I think you're both arguing the same thing from different angles.

You can be compassionate, but neutral. This whole thing has opened my eyes that theres a major problem with these twitch personalities and out of control egos, personality disorders even, somethings up, it's also opened my eyes that there are plenty of people that are willing to throw someone under the bus for attention. Some accusations stack up, some don't, it's awful in both cases, that's why it's best to be cautious, which you can do while still recognising a pattern of behaviour and accepting that these things DO happen and there ARE victims of it. I just know I'm not qualified enough, and I don't know enough, in most cases to make a properly informed decision to the point I'd be comfortable labelling someone a rapist. That's what it comes down to, it's not a label you can easily take back, but it's one that can ruin a life, so I'd want to be sure before being a part of potentially ending one.",1593048340,"you can be compassionate, but neutral.","compassionate, but neutral","compassionate","but",TRUE,"compassionate , but neutral","neutral",NA,NA,1
"fvtbmej","There is actually a ton of research on spanking and its effects, some of it is summarized [here](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-baby-scientist/201812/the-science-spanking). It's not especially effective, creates animosity and can lead to incredibly negative short and long-term outcomes.   
Personally, I think that a very occasional spank is probably not too detrimental but only IF the parent can completely divorce their own emotions from it, which is nearly impossible. As soon as you're taking your anger or frustration out on a child, it turns into abuse.   
My parents were largely loving and compassionate, but I was spanked and hit in the face periodically as a kid. It was frightening and deeply humiliating.

Actual study done on happiness (and by happiness it was a study of groups by suicide rate-Emile Durkheim, for all u nerds out there- sociology...least amount of suicide=happiest)

And by order of Happiest to least happy I give you the results:

-Married men (most happy, least suicide)
-Single women
-Single men
-Married women

Now let’s give this a real think. Why are men who are married the happiest? Welp, they are looked after, have the least amount of housework, most amount of support, but is this reciprocal?

Look at the least happy group for your answer.

I am on my second marriage and as women, we will forever have a much higher expectation as mother and wife than men ever seem to have. Even now (the Emile Durkheim study was a long time ago but holds true)

Apologies that this isn’t really an answer.

I support being kind and compassionate but do not ever, my dear, and I mean Ever, put your happiness after a mans, even your own husband.

He clearly is in denial. With any luck, he’ll accept eventually and find a replacement for you. Hope she is a kind person and doesnt treat your kids shitty.

My ex and I have been divorced a long time now, but he’s been thru many girlfriends and a few wives because he can’t be alone.

Now, cults (and racism is a cult) thrive on alienation and isolation so I wonder if, once hurt feelings have had a chance to settle, it might be worth reaching out to her somehow (maybe a letter?) to remind her that you love her, you don't have favorites amongst your children, you miss her, and when she can shed her racism she is welcome. And make small stands as well as big ones. Make it clear that she's welcome to dinner if she doesn't say racist things, and when she breaks that rule, stop everything and ask her firmly to leave. And keep doing that work. Imagine she has a problem with peeing on the floor but refuses to wear a diaper, if it helps to conceptualize.

 Her husband can keep her radicalized and make it worse by giving her the impression that there is no going back now, that he is her only support, and that she burned all of her bridges. It may not happen for 5 years, for 10, maybe ever. But by reinforcing boundaries you demonstrate to her and your other children and grandchildren that racism is harmful and will not be tolerated down to the smallest microaggression.

I love my partner and he is incredibly caring and compassionate but every once in a while he will say something kind of tone deaf and insensitive. Luckily, he does affirm his love and feelings and attraction to me enough that I can let it slide or communicate I didn't like it. 

 The thing about your feelings is they are your feelings and they are valid. It isn't a question about rational and non rational. Is is a question of him saying something that was tone deaf and insensitive and you not having a positive feeling towards it. He can't argue with with your feelings. They're your feelings.

How will you move forward from here? I have been reading books about how to have positive interactions and one of the recommendations is to draw out your boundaries, communicate your boundaries to a partner in love in advance, and then have consequences and repercussions when those boundaries are broken. 

For example, my partner has done a wonderful job growing but at 1st he would sometimes interrupt me when we disagreed and not let me finish my sentence. I let him know it was a deal breaker for me and that if it continued to purposefully prevent me from finishing a sentence simply because he disagreed it would be something that would cause me to not be able to continue the relationship. He has done a wonderful job with being more conscious about interrupting in fact he doesn't do it anymore so that is why I care about him. Hes not perfect but he really tries to improve himself and I also am not perfect and I am trying to improve myself.

 It wouldn't have to be that drastic of course. Sometimes a consequence could be just saying that if you say something disrespectful I will leave the Room. You get to dictate how people treat you.

"fus5ps9","Hey all,

I've self-tested as INFJ twice in my life, few years apart for both times, and I definitely identify as INFJ; lots of my traits make more sense to me since having come to this information, around 6-7 years ago the first time. As a note, I highly dislike any sort of personality-typing, I actually hate astrology and other such nonesense (no offense to anyone who does!). So for me to find descriptive text written by others that I actually eerily relate to, it was a pretty big deal for me. In ways it's helped me understand myself... and at other times, I wish I wasn't like this and sometimes, even as an ""adult"" (31), I struggle feeling like I can control my reactions.

Right now, I'm in a pretty deep well of misery over my closest friend of the past 10 years. I know people change, especially during the time from our 20's to our 30's. My friend is 3 years younger than me. In the past year or so, I've began to feel a drift between us, culminating in the past few months. I always thought I knew her very well, but recently she's been stating opinions and thoughts that I just can't get behind. In simple terms, politically and ideologically, we are going completely different directions. She comes from a rather conservative family. When we met 10 years ago, she always proclaimed to not view things at all in the way her parents do. We always bonded on so many things, and could talk about anything. So, I feel she's recently either began to change, to veer towards her parents' views, or she's always been this way and somehow hidden it from me. Typical for INFJ's, I have a pretty good b\*llshit-o-meter, so I do think her more left-leaning views of the past were genuine. Some of the things she's been saying recently have frankly worried me; repeating lies spread by republican politicians which with only a s quick Google-search can be checked as false. She is highly educated, but doesn't seem to fact-check. She's not as interested in politics as I am, and even I find most of it a bore, but I deeply care about this planet and what's happening to it, and I think every person should be on top of what's happening politically. So in this we are drifting very far apart, her opinions based on unchecked information (I believe her dad feeds her this bullshit and because she respects him, she doesn't question it), and when I try to explain that things aren't necessarily as she sees them, she doesn't accept my explanations. Sometimes I feel she belittles my knowledge of things because I don't have the same level of academic education.

Another thing is, 4 years ago I moved to the other side of the world. So this means our friendship has been long-distance since. We've met up several times, and upkept a relationship because our friendship is very important for us. I think what I'm struggling with right now, is not knowing how to approach her. Any times we've talked on the phone, and I've brought up something related to politics, she starts spewing her views which are not things she's ever said (to me at least) before. Like I said, some of them are downright ignorant. I am a deeply ideological person, and have very strong views on things like human and animal rights etc. In ways, she's definitely a humanist and compassionate, but it seems her compassion is rather limited. Many of her views are very conflicted with one another; and it sort of concerns me she doesn't see this conflict at all.

If we still lived in the same place, I could meet with her in person and try to talk this out. But we can't; and I don't feel any of this is appropriate to bring up over email or even Skype/whatever chat or phone call. It's too delicate for that. I don't want to not be friends with her, I love her very much and it would be completely strange to not have her in my life. I just feel so confused as to who this person is now, who never used to resort to responding to my very basic ideas of equal human rights with some rather right-wing opinions. I don't claim to be the more politically ""woke"" one of us, I don't think my views hold any absolute truth. I'm just lost as to how to approach someone very dear to me who I now barely recognize. I'm simply sad, and don't want to door-slam her out of my life. I don't have the healthiest coping mechanisms, and I definitely have a tendency to shut people out when I don't know how to broach situations anymore. I never ever thought this would happen between me and this particular friend. 

I feel like I have two options; either let go of the fact that our views are now so different, and accept we just won't be as close anymore. Or, try to find a way to discuss these issues over the phone; we likely won't see each other for a while, with the corona virus situation making cross-continent travel extremely questionable. It's likely I'm blowing this out of proportion, and many normal people would not care as much. I think it's good to have all kinds of friends, but I doubt anyone is super close with someone whose political and ideological views are miles apart from theirs.

I'm simply sad, and sort of disappointed in myself for being so lost as to what to do. I do believe this is due to my INFJ personality; I can see what's happening in my mind and my logic, and how it's affecting this whole situation.

"fuq9uuh","Going to use HC = hardened character and VC = vulnerable character.

To begin, empathy and sympathy have different meanings, so I think you need to first decide whether or not HC is able to feel either of those things. Just because HC does not feel what VC feels (empathy) doesn't mean HC can't feel bad for VC's circumstances (sympathy). I have to add that being hardened doesn't mean they can't be kind to others, only that they are resilient and stoic after facing the problem.

The second thing you have to decide is whether or not HC will be *compassionate* to the vulnerable character (VC), regardless of your answer to the first part. This will decide how HC acts towards HC. If they are compassionate, they will try to help VC through the panic attack, or maybe will stand around awkwardly not knowing how to help. This can be because it's the right thing to do, or because it's the *correct* thing to do, or simply because doing so is expected of them. If they're not compassionate, but still sympathetic, they might feel bad but take no actions; maybe they view it as a waste of time, maybe they don't think they can help or that VC needs help.

Maybe HC finds VC weak for having a panic attack. Maybe they find VC intriguing for breaking down after surviving hell, or admire VC for waiting to be safe before breaking down.

"fuosqp4","My one (admittedly problematic) hangup on abandoning my weird soft-spot for Cracker is that Bob thinks so highly of her.

I trust Bob's opinion on pretty much everything. Maybe that's naive of me, but I just feel like...there's something I'm missing.

These statements are gross, but my gut reaction is that hurt people hurt people, and Cracker lashed out (continually, it seems) because she was hurt by Asia's comments. Not excusing the behavior, Cracker, as a whole ass adult, should know that lashing out at people who hurt you doesn't really solve anything, but there's something in me that understands the act of lashing out when someone hurts your feelings or invalidates your work.

Trust me, my ex BPD is fucking genuine.  She can come across as completely authentic, considerate, cool and compassionate but deep in there it’s there and when it come out you do not want to be associated with it.  Every man she’s ever been with was portrayed as a monster to me.  She’d also say they were nice people but then subtly she’d be saying very unfair things about them.  As the time I excused it all but lo and behold five/six years later and it’s being said about me but worse.

I also had a friend, female.. who I have thought about occasionally since I found out about BPD, nearly a year ago now.  I remember she was super cool and we had a lot in common.  Very attractive, quick witted, sexual, open, honest and intriguing and I started spending time with her, working on a project and it got to the point where I had to phone another female friend, who we were working with and ask her to stay with me when the other girl was around.  The reason?  I felt she was misinterpreting things I was saying.  I felt she was flirting with me when alone but then being standoffish when in the presence of others.  To the point that I recognised it could be a problem.  Now I ask myself if she was BPD and so many things do add up but again, she was super charming, fun, anything goes attitude, sensible, well known and liked but start digging a little deeper and people would say “oh that’s just how she is” well yeah... if that’s how she is then that can be problematic if not very carefully looked out for.

I hope that makes sense.  The point I am making is do not take the risk.  As others have said, if you’re here asking... that’s probably because you’re feeling or have felt red flags.  Please don’t ignore those feelings.  That was the biggest mistake I made and my biggest regret.  I felt the feelings but didn’t necessarily see them for what they were until it was too late.

"fth7guz","This is a brilliant response, it helped me reflect on my question and goals better. My goal is to find the Truth, I've been on this search for several years now. It's been frustrating many times, I've had my pitfalls, but at the end of it I've come a better person than before. And what I've realised so far is that it's really difficult to believe anyone or any tradition that claims to have all the answers. So what do I do I thought, there's definitely very realised and inspiring people out there. Buddhism has caught my interest, for over a year now I keep coming back to it - so there must be something here that keeps drawing me to it? 

At least relatively speaking I see promise here to find the most answers, the Buddhist path seem to offer the most techniques and practice on the path liberation. Meditation has helped me become more aware of my negative and positive habits and overall I've become more caring. I'm not here with some political agenda, I'm very conscious of falling in the trap of cherry picking religions, becoming too attached to my beliefs and so on. I have a thirst for attaining wisdom and healthier mind.

But I need somewhere to start. Maybe my perceptions will change but as it stands, pure monasticism to me shows the dangers of me getting too involved in just helping myself, becoming too withdrawn. I can do loving kindness all I want and feel happy and compassionate, but when that gets tested in my personal relationships is when I know whether all this practice has actually led to something. I'm also a married man, so full monasticism is not an option at least anywhere in the near future.

Speaking of sticking with my own religion, I struggle to do that. I was a Sikh and I see their gurus as enlightenment without renunciation, this idea of living in the world but without attached to it has stayed with me. The problem is I just don't find the writings they've left beneficial enough for me to attain this goal. During my studies Mahayana holds promise for this I discovered, now I'm just trying to figure out where to start honestly. It seems Guru Yoga is something only needed when one advances - I wasn't aware of this, I thought this was an integral part from the very beginning and it made me feel uneasy. It's a problem that I haven't ever met a Buddhist or know one, so I can't discuss my thoughts and problems with anyone I know. The discussions here are the closest to such an opportunity I've found.",1591712008,"i can do loving kindness all i want and feel happy and compassionate, but when that gets tested in my personal relationships is when i know whether all this practice has actually led to something.","happy and compassionate","compassionate",NA,FALSE,"happy and compassionate","happy",NA,NA,0

"ft0e4b2","Trans woman (and lesbian - yes, they both matter for one of the reviews) here! I’ve got some thoughts on the books I’ve finished (organized in alphabetical order, not release order. Also, most of these are very short):


Bachelorette Party was incredible. First and foremost, I felt Aisha was extremely well-written. I don’t think most cis people understand, but transition is a *crushing* expense. For MtF folks like myself, it can cost as much as $25k for bottom surgery, $5k for top surgery, $30k for vocal cord surgery, $15-25k for facial feminization surgery, $100/month for hormones, and $300/session for laser hair removal (way more if you do electrolysis. Also, all numbers are what my personal costs would’ve been with no insurance, and I spend years shopping around for better options). By the end of it, you’re broken, battered, physically weakened, and bankrupt. I sacrificed my college education so I could transition. Many people sacrifice even more. It was incredibly, viscerally real to see Aisha taking sketchy jobs because they paid well. When you’re that far in debt, you have no choice. It’s a heartbreaking reality for most of us, that even if we don’t have to turn elsewhere for funds, we’re permanently financially crippled, and enslaved by our debt. The book handled the issues with poise and compassion, something I have NEVER seen in *any* form of writing before. The rest of the book being a lighthearted romp was, in my opinion, a necessity to avoid the depressing reality of the struggles Aisha faced, and I also felt it was enjoyable. I also really loved the mad max scene and the drug trip, mostly cause they were such good demonstrations of how to inject a unique flair into the writing without compromising its narrative.

Blades of Light and Shadow is so far my all-around absolute favorite book. Other books outdo it in various categories, but no book ties its strengths together as well as BoLaS. It also felt like a story I’d want to tell in a real Dungeons &amp; Dragons campaign, which is an incredible rarity amongst fantasy storytelling. I felt the lore built up in the story was well-utilized, and I enjoyed that we were given a blank slate of a character to work with. It would be somewhat nice to see some more of our backstory fleshed out in the second book, especially giving some more flair to the humans and orcs, but even so, I felt it covered a ton of ground very well and with very strong pacing. I have had so much fun writing up a backstory for my elf I played as in BoLaS so I can play as her in a future D&amp;D campaign. I am super hyped for book 2!

The Crown &amp; The Flame felt shallow and devoid of life. I hated being made to play as Dom, I felt the characters were uncompelling, and my choices felt genuinely meaningless. I don’t really have any praise for it other than its service in giving me a world to work with to create a homebrew D&amp;D module, but even that was unexceptional. I also don’t particularly enjoy all the references to it in the other books.

The Elementalists was super fun! It was everything I’d wished Harry Potter was, but with next to none of the problems that plagued JK Rowling’s writing. I wish we’d gotten at least one more book. I really wanted to have one last book go by, and basically be about the Pend Pals trying to re-adjust to life when their lives weren’t constantly in danger. I also felt that Griffin was the sweetest and most wholesome character PB has ever written, and no one can change my mind.

Endless Summer was fun. It was an interesting and cool story, but its one shortfall was that more than any other book, I felt railroaded into certain paths or choices I didn’t want. Now, some railroading happens in every book, but I was somewhat disappointed at the way the MC was treated the first 2 books, and then after finally giving me the freedom to do what I wanted in the 3rd book, the ending was literally just “how do you wanna die?” Now, all that being said, I did still love the story. I just also had a couple more major complaints.

The Freshman series was...*bad*. It totally mishandled queer representation, railroaded romances, and had such uncompelling conflicts that I’m shocked I finished the series. Becca’s redemption arc was a significant improvement, but it felt like it was one of the few good things done by the series.

The Heist: Monaco was super fun. It felt like a romp around the world, and sometimes, it’s just good to be the bad guy. I don’t have tons to say, but I did enjoy my pyromaniac wife Eris. I would’ve liked to see one more book, but it probably would’ve felt very same-y, so I suppose it’s for the best.

Hero was kinda good, but I didn’t like the supporting cast. The lack of a sequel definitely doesn’t help either, and I wish there were more compelling LIs. Unfortunately, since it left off where it did, it suffers greatly.

High School Story was wild. While the story itself was occasionally out there (*stares at Isa*), the book did serve as a genuine source of relief, comfort, and safety for me. In real life, I struggled for a long time with trying to balance my love of sports with my love of school. Ultimately, it culminated in burnout and giving up on things I loved. Between Maria as the compassionate but dedicated student, Caleb as the strongest, both in physical terms and in heart, and the writing of the MC to be kind and caring, even as a running back/shooting guard/first baseman, and her being relatively intelligent felt like the first time I’d ever seen positive affirmation of my personal right &amp; ability to be both a massive nerd and a happy jock. It was a rare bit of writing that I felt was handled very well, and I am extremely grateful to the writers for having unintentionally helped grant me affirmation and support as I’ve reconciled with who I am in real life.

High School Story: Class Act wasn’t bad, but it had all the same limitations of the initial trilogy, and no real additions. I loved Skye though, and felt she had a very good arc. The rest of the book was less than stellar, and I did ultimately enjoy Maria’s send-off to the new class president at the end of book 2.

Most Wanted was okayish. Biggest problem was that it leaned into police abuse &amp; corruption (both Massey &amp; Reyes were jerks) and then didn’t realize it was as problematic as it was. There were no consequences for their vigilantism, their abuses of power &amp; authority, or their murder of a fleeing suspect - they get rewarded for their killing of a fleeing suspect! (The book is extra problematic now, since people seem to be becoming aware of the brutality of police)

Perfect Match was very interesting. I quite enjoyed the exploration of Hayden’s humanity, and felt it was well-handled. I was somewhat disappointed by the ending, but all in all, I felt the story was very compelling through-and-through.



And that’s everything I’ve finished. At some point, I’d like to do the It Lives series, since the community seems to love it, but I think I’ll save it for closer to Halloween.

Edit: I ended up cutting out a portion of the BP review, since it dealt with more traumatic stuff and forgot to change the intro.

"fswu8jh","I matched with a meat eater on OkCupid that had a lot of common interests and was attractive. During each date I would always introduce him to vegan food, some he liked some he didn’t like, and when I asked why he wasn’t vegan on the second or third date he said he might consider trying it as diet like a year in the future, but I didn’t give up, because he was a compassionate and thoughtful person in every other aspect of his life so I knew if he was exposed to some videos and debated with he might change. 

He was interested in philosophy, so on the fourth date or so where he told me he’d like to become official, I told him I would like to but I don’t think we have compatible morals so I don’t think it would work out. He questioned me on this, so I told him about how he doesn’t care that animals suffer for his tastebuds. He said he wasn’t sure it made a difference, so I told him about supply and demand. I asked him if he’s ever seen slaughterhouse videos before and he said no, so I showed him the trailer for Dominion. After that, he went silent, and it took him some time to process it. He decided to go vegan then and there, he didn’t want to watch the whole documentary. A few days ago, we went jetskiing for the first time to celebrate our 1 year dating anniversary. We’ll probably get married.

The key (in my experience) is to date multiple people at the same time / give lots of people a chance, to not force your partner to go vegan so you need to be ready to walk away and not get attached unless they decide to go vegan after becoming educated, to aim for dating people who are compassionate but for some reason or another don’t believe their purchases make a difference or aren’t aware about the realities of animal farming, and to save the vegan talk for once THEY bring up wanting to become exclusive, which means they are invested in you and therefore willing to open their minds to the reality of farming if it means you’ll be fully compatible.

I tried very hard to thicken my skin and learn to take the good in the harsh comments.  My reasoning was that there was probably a seed of truth in most things, and trying to find it was a good exercise.  Additionally, hearing some of the hard stuff from strangers may have taken the onus off of my B person, to have to express some of the harder things to me which would have been stressful and triggering to him.  So I think that was good.  

But I gained the most growth and understanding from people who were compassionate but direct.  

As a W, when I posted about times I felt weak or angry or overwhelmed, I was almost universally told to get over myself.   This is unrealistic because as a W, you are in it for the long haul in healing.. to be encouraged is necessary.  Most Ws here are not looking for justification or making excuses.. they  are seeking advice, understanding, support for their goals of reconciliation, they are wanting help in making amends and navigating the situation without causing further harm.

"fs5yxnc","Really? Well, I suppose a democracy would be take a few generations post CF wouldn't it? Then we'll get the fun things like political parties and partisanism. Won't those be some fun times! 

Yeah, they will, because guess what, this is still a feudalistic medieval society and you can't just snap your fingers and change all of that. Bloodline rulership is going to continue on in no matter how hard you try to stomp it out. It may not be big thing in first world countries, but it's still very much the case in some other parts of the world. Even in first world countries bloodlline rulership is still practiced with companies and businesses, those things will always get people to look at it and even consider it, even if the current political system doesn't. 

And that right there is the kind of idealism from Edelgard fans that I find laughable and off-putting. You're assuming that people will do that when they can just decide whoever gets the crown gets the crown, not to mention it's still banking on EDELGARD deciding who's worthy. Nothing is ever mentioned of anyone else's input, just her. 

""Brilliant and kind""...what is this, a Disney fairy tale? You can be brutal and ruthless, but still an efficient ruler. You can be kind and compassionate, but an ineffective ruler. What if no on measures up to her standards? Or for that matter people reject her successor because THEY don't view them as being worthy of ruling.

You talk about people's expectations changing, but sometimes that doesn't happen. This is politics so you'll have people jockeying for power, just like they always will in which case who Edelgard chooses may clash with who the masses want. That brings me to the final hole in your brilliant little theory, what if she chooses wrong? 

You claim a chosen successor is preferable over bloodline succession, but who's doing the choosing is still human thus capable of making mistakes, just like any other human being. Edelgard is fully capable of making mistake since at the end of the day she's ultimately still just a human being, a human being who can choose right...and wrong. Whose choices can backfire on her and everyone else. 

Symbols may have power, but what can those powers be used for? Here's another fun fact, that power of symbolism can be warped, just as the duties of Crest that the Church preached of was warped as time went by. It's outright stated that in the Church's scripture that Crest Bearers have a duty to use their powers wisely, but, shock! People are people and warp and abuse that! Edelgard became an icon who smashed the old world older to create a new one, what if someone decides to do the same to the society she leaves behind because they disagree with it?

Here's another thing for your idealistic little mind to sit on. What happens when someone else thinks they're more worthy than Edelgard's successor? What then? What if they try to prove their worthiness? By force even? You know, the same way that Edelgard effectively made herself supreme ruler. When Julius Caesar marched his army int Roman, he set an example, became, in YOUR OWN WORDS, a symbol- a symbol that if you have the power or willingness, follow your ambitions. If a situation like that arose, what would Edelgard do? Who would she side with? What if her decision puts her in conflict with others who reject her choice? Since you also mentioned symbols, Dimitri's likely cousins could still be around in the CF? What about them? What if they choose to rebel and become symbols themselves? It cuts multiple ways.  

Hate to break it to you, but I'm not going to stop nitpicking because there's so many holes in Edelgard's supposed perfect ending. People can have the power of choice...but you better realize that sometimes, people chose wrong. Here in the US, almost four years ago, people had a choice...and they made one that has made the US a laughing stock and left it crippled as the world endures the worst outbreak since the Spanish Flu. The outcome of said choice refuses to acknowledge that anything is wrong or that the response has been even close to lagging. He is supported by a party of people, many of whom were, wait for it...CHOSEN by the people, who rather than stop him stand by and does nothing. 

Moral of the story, ""chosen successor"" isn't automatically superior to bloodline succession, nor is the latter superior to the former. They're both systems that count on people. Flawed, hypocritical, stupid, angry, and capable people.

I understand where your boyfriend is coming from, and that he is obviously a person with deep empathy and compassion for others (sounds like a great guy, btw!), but I wonder if he has thought his reasoning through all of the way. 

My guess is that most of the people there will be around your parents age or older, and this is where his concern is coming from. However, he is not giving them freedom of choice to make their own decisions. 

Years ago, I volunteered as a grief counselor at an AIDS hospice. This was during a time when the anti-viral therapies weren't that good yet, and getting sick could kill someone. 

Amongst my tasks, I was to drive patients to doctor's visits and escort them to see friends who were in the hospital. I was there to be their moral support, and to help cushion any bad news they received. 

I will never forget this one flamboyant gay man who put me in my place when I questioned his judgment about seeing an old acquaintance at a hospital that was known to not be very clean- I mean come on, what was he doing risking his life to see someone he barely knows who is most likely going to recover, but he could die?!?! The whole thing seemed idiotic to me, but I pushed my judgments aside and softly told him my concerns. 

Boy, did I ever get put in my place!

He looks at me, pushes his sunglasses down his nose with his carefully manicured fingernails and says 'Girlfriend, I did not survive Catholic School and all that jazz, to not be who I AM today! Ain't nobody going to take away my right to see my friend, if I want to see them! This is my life, and I get to choose how I live it!', and with that he puckered his bright red lips and blew me a kiss that both was the biggest F-U ever and also a hug- I am telling you, that man was special and I loved him dearly. 

What he reminded me of was one of the first tenants of what you are taught when you go into hospice care- protect the freedom of choice, it is often the last dignity a human being will ever have. 

So, OP, I leave you with that man's words to me- here I was thinking I was being kind, thoughtful and compassionate but really I was being ignorant, rude and condescending of his personal choice.

"frjnzhq","Consider this.

As the Blue Spirit, we see Zuko preform incredible feats and acts of acrobatics and swordsmanship. All without Firebending. 

Jack, at level 1, was taken from the far past and plunged into the alien future by being thrown from his fight Demon king Aku, into several layers of hover car traffic, forcing him to suddenly survive both. 

He takes almost no damage doing either. He is so well trained and so skilled at maneuvering himself that, in the face of culture shock that would make Fry from futurama blush, you still can't wound the guy with a flying car. Episode 1. And Jack only gets tougher from there.

Consider, as well, Jack's sword.

When taken by Aku and used against him, the sword would not pierce his skin, because the blade cannot harm the pure of heart. Additionally, the sword is shown to have powerful, purifying abilities when applied to spiritual and demonic forces. I that I think we can safely assume that, just like in the Episide where Jack's soul is stolen by Demons, that Jack is fully capable of defending himself from, and completely annihilating maligned spiritual forces. 

So Ko the face stealer, the Panda spirit, the Owl Spirit, they are minced meat if they cross Jack. Avatars are not equipped to do battle with the spirits, but to harmonize and communicate with them, bridging the worlds. Jack was tailor trained and molded to EXTERERMINATE spiritual and mystical enemies, to the point that he doesn't kill a human until he is already a veteran of decades.

But then one must also take into account Jack's personal spiritual strength and connection.

Jack was Chosen by the Gods, Odin, Osiris, and Vishnu, to save the world spiritual/moral annihilation at the hands of Aku, a literal lovecraftian evil. Before ever touching his holy sword, he was already deeply immersed in the most profound forms of meditation and self mastery from literally every major culture of his time, a complete inversion of Aang, who ran away from his destiny.

Not only is he shown to navigate the spiritual world, but he has allies. Spirits, beasts, and angels seem to understand Jack's purity, if not his mission, nearly at a glance, and go far out of their way to aid him. Aang is not so, for despite having good intentions, Aang is fearful, selfish, vain, and uncommitted beyond his guilt at the onset of the series. All things he must grow to surpass.

Lastly, we must remember that Jack is a strategist and a leader of men. 

He cannot learn bending, but as we make him trace Aangs steps, he would be raising and moving an army, overthrowing fire nation garassons, tag teaming mentoring Zuko with Iroh as Zuko hopelessly tries to capture or stop him, and over turning the fire nation before ever meeting the Fire Lord personally.

He would be a bender blocker by the second month, he would have freed and unified the water nations by month 6, and hed be ruling the fire nation by the end of the year, travel not withstanding. Jack is wise and compassionate, but clever and used to working with unskilled troops and makeshift weapons. He is hard to defeat, impossible to catch, and easy to surrender to.

Overall, if Aku couldn't devise a way to maime jack for five decades of trying everything, then Jack takes this 10/10 everytime. Only blood benders could stand a chance.

"fredi84","Re: legitimately abusive

Yeah, that's kind of an issue for me + pet. Well, maybe it's just me being worried. He has... well, shit parents that abused him (physically and emotionally), he's been harmed physically (legitimate non-consent 😣), partners that used him (emotional), he has no self-esteem... He's, in my eyes, so sweet and compassionate but so vulnerable, and it worries me that I might take things too far, even if he tells me he wants to do xyz/'anything you want, what I want doesn't matter'.

This is a kinda sensitive issue for me, as an ex asked me to be rough with him, and specifically asked to slap his face (nothing huge, but regardless). We were in the middle of a session and so I obliged without question - the immediate look I got told me everything I needed to know, and I immediately went into I guess a sort of aftercare mode. He insisted that it was okay, but that face, that pained emotion, has stayed with me years later. I couldn't imagine how horrible I would feel if someone like my pet was hurt like that... Fuck :( over the years I've tried really hard to always be supportive and be someone he can trust. I worry about something like that happening a lot, and ruining that trust.

I just don't want to (seriously, and/or permanently) hurt/upset him, so it's hard sometimes to - in my mind - do something risky to make him happy/fulfilled a request.

Being upset for a few days or something makes sense. Staying upset for that long and not being able to communicate effectively the whole time is a major problem. In this specific case, so is being self-absorbed to the point where you're ignoring your spouse's birthday and your anniversary.

Putting the onus on your spouse to second guess you and try to figure out what you actually want isn't fair, mature or productive.

"fr7fn9j","I ended up liking my most recent playthrough of Inquisition so much that I made it my canon one! Female Trevelyan warrior named Milena; overall diplomatic and compassionate, but also had a strong sense of right and wrong &amp; did her best to stick to her values. She’s also the first ‘faithful’ Inquisitor I’ve played, had no trouble accepting the title of Herald and initially believed her mark was a gift from the Maker.

I had her romance Blackwall while also occasionally picking ‘flirt’ options with Cullen - which sort of set up a headcanon that Cullen developed feelings for her early on, even while she was pursuing a relationship with Blackwall. After Blackwall’s personal quest she broke up with him on the basis of him lying to her for so long, and although they remained friends, she eventually came to reciprocate Cullen’s feelings and landed up with him instead. (rebound Cullenmance ftw)

I also headcanoned that - even though she befriended her entire inner circle - she considered Solas her closest friend/confidant, and was deeply hurt by his betrayal. There’s a dialogue option I picked in Trespasser that I thought was oddly fitting: when she says to Solas, *“I never thought of you as someone who would do that”* after he reveals his plans, and he thanks her. It just again so nicely summed up the way I thought of their friendship, that Milena greatly respected his opinion and held him in high esteem (even when they debated), and he was moved by her trust.

Despite this, she’s going the “stop Solas at all costs” route. She believes his plans are dangerous enough that if killing him is what it takes to save the lives at stake, then, well, she’ll probably stab him whilst crying profusely??

As far as other decisions she made: allied with the mages, didn’t encourage Cassandra to rebuild the Seekers, unwittingly hardened Leliana (didn’t stop her from killing the traitor in Haven as she wasn’t Inquisitor yet &amp; didn’t feel it was her place), kept Celene alive as sole ruler (though unreconciled with Briala), allied with the Wardens, left Hawke in the Fade, let Morrigan drink from the Well, made Cole more of a spirit, and disbanded the Inquisition.

"fr5xyhy","I do want this but I'm actually conflicted about how to go about it. I think that pushing too hard against fundamentalist religions and controlling groups can help them strengthen in both the short and long run.

I bet we've all experienced the aspect of yiddishkeit that's the simultaneous fear of and superiority to outsiders. I think post-Holocaust trauma has been a major catalyst for today's frumkeit looking so tragic, abusive, etc. as Jewish people reproduce their worst experiences in the form of a culture. Not like the Jewish idea of constantly being persecuted started recently in Europe - of course there have been tons of real experiences of antisemitism in history but we also draw upon the Bible as our history that contains ahistorical / imagined instances of persecution that is kind of the basis of our identity.... (עבדים היינו לפרעה במצרים עתה בני חורין)

Also another factor is how confronting the difference between secular cultures and religious cultures is today. 60, 70 years ago at least in America you had men wearing suits and hats, women wearing skirts, no public acceptance of LGBT, less premarital sex and dating and PDA, many women homemakers without jobs, more separation between racial/ethnic groups, most people eating at home their own food most of the time, very traditional family, gender, and class roles, that kind of thing - you're not as unusual under that context to be an Orthodox Jew. I think under those circumstances it would be easier to relate to ""outsiders"" and you did see a huge move towards assimilation from many Jews who understood that they could be part of a wider world. The others doubled or tripled down on yiddishkeit. In today's society the norms have moved far beyond anything except the most left-wings of Orthodoxy (that obviously ""real"" frum people call ""fake"" Orthodox) is able to accept or pretend to blend in amongst, and a lot of the world looks like a caricature of the things we've been indoctrinated to stay away from.

I think these are somethings that are making the hold of Judaism on religious Jews stronger, not weaker, even though I wish it were the opposite. And I'm not sure exactly how to wrap up with the perfect summary main point I wanted to say other than I think antagonizing frum people (and others from cult-like environments) can backfire in bad ways and reinforce their ideas of needing to double down on isolationism, atypical behaviour, non-normative beliefs, etc. Where I'm from there have been a lot of laws passed in the last couple years to try and enforce public secularism and limit the ability of religious people (mostly Jews, Muslims, and Sikhs) to engage in their practices, dress, education, that kind of thing and it definitely hasn't made religious people somehow ""wake up"" and decide to be secular - they just (rightly?) experience it as discrimination from ""the nonbelievers who will always try to stop them from doing god's will"" (or whatever they say), which makes them feel validated in listening to their religious leaders and texts which promise their small and extreme group has the only right way to live and that outsiders who don't understand will always target them for what they're doing, possibly even because they're put there by god as a deliberate obstacle to test your faith and endurance.

Somehow, I have to believe that an open and tolerant society that is compassionate but rigorous in its pursuit of truth would result in more religious people leaving their specific isolationist groups to join the wider world, but I can't be sure.

"fr0nbgs","&gt; According a lot of vegans there are 5 levels all with slightly differing views, just because you don’t think that doesn’t mean you are correct.

Care to source this? I participate in vegan activism and I’m active in vegan circles, both online and off-line, and I’ve never heard this before. 

&gt; I agree the fruitarian diet is not healthy and a vegan diet CAN be healthy if done correctly, same as vegetarian, same as omnivorous diets. 

Agree. 

&gt; Clearly killing plants isn’t an ethical dilemma and anyone who is saying that it is are just trying to provoke a response, it’s a joke just ignore it.

&gt; It’s not gatekeeping material as it’s just stating a fact.

The part where they’re describing processes is a fact, but the part where they say these plant foods aren’t vegan =/= a fact. 

For example, ever since David Attenborough came out with a documentary involving Orangutans and deforestation for palm oil, there’s been an effort (much more serious than the above) to say that if you consume palm oil, then you aren’t vegan. On my fb, some idiot vegan (only person I’d refer this to) said that using a vaccine isn’t vegan, because it uses a plant product, and they aren’t going to get COVID-19 testing. 

With palm oil, what’s often not mentioned is that it takes less space to grow palm oil than about any other oil out there, and that not consuming palm oil means all processed foods is out (and I know someone who does this, and had their bf do it, who finds veganism that much more difficult now than it should be). Not consuming palm oil = no more Oreos, and their is no real proof that it’s even better for animals. 

My issue here is that veganism isn’t about purity. It’s quite literally in the definition. **as far as is possible and practicable**. Because vegans get fucked with a lot by non-vegans about not being perfect, imo they start to attach all these stupid other things to it too. 

And I’ll add that people have done with regards to almonds, cashews, avocados, Beyond Burgers, Impossible burgers, vaccines (as I just mentioned), etc.

"fqxj584","I see what you are saying, but I’d personally like to reclaim these terms and widen their mainstream definitions instead of allowing the establishment to assign masculinity to men and femininity to women, forcing occult systems that have understood the true definitions of these terms to have to change.

We should not be catering to the ignorant just because being ignorant is popular.

We are not educated as a species. Occult just means “hidden”. It’s not special or otherworldly knowledge. It is the full accumulated knowledge of what is between our ears.

If I had said Yin and Yang, would that help? I do bring that up at one point.

Another example: in occultism, masculinity is associated with light, and femininity with darkness. Sounds pretty judgmental, right?

But is light better than dark? Why do we think this way?

Femininity can be forceful and aggressive, but it manifests differently. Masculinity can be soft and compassionate, but again, it just looks different. Neither of these statements have anything to do with the fact that a biological woman can still be masculine and a biological man can still be feminine.

Occultism sees more of the interplay, recognizes them as inseparable, which I think is an important lesson for modern society to learn, and promotes a non-binary view of the world through this understanding of the binary.

There is not a “third gender”, there are infinite expressions of gender within the spectrum of these two polarities.

And in all honesty, both sides of the war made good and bad choices and good and bad moral moves.

Keep  in mind that the galaxies, plural, under Jedi or imperial or any other control were so vast and separate that it was impossible to please them all.

I see alot of people asking for relationship advice and being given false hope. It really bothers me because it could make their pain longer. This is another reason why I hesitate to recommend modern astrology. Really astrologers should speak the sweet truth - be kind and compassionate but also honest. I've had readings where the astrologer has sugarcoated things and I've felt misled and it's not really helpful. I feel it when they're holding back and I wish they would speak frankly.

"fpocsvm","The four preferred functions of an INFP are Fi-Ne-Si-Te in order of Strongest to weakest control over the function and when healthy and developed in a balanced way they create a person who is compassionate but able to make real world impact. If you stack jump you in effect toss everything to the side but Te. Te, as an aux Te user myself, is a fairly blunt instrument. There's a reason Te doms run afoul of other types enough to have a reputation. Think ENTJs and ESTJs. They may be individually lovely people but Te isn't for making people feel good, it's for achieving a set goal effectively, and it takes a lot (think years, sometimes a whole lifetime) of practice for a dom or aux Te user to use it in a way that doesnt make others feel like they're being run over by tank. I have struggled with it forever. 

So I meet an INFP that was married to an ESTJ for 14 years and has learned to stack jump to comply with her no doubt stress inducing demands. It was bad. If it's hard to control as a conscious function (Carl Jung theorized that the fourth function in your stack was somewhat unconscious and almost seemed to take on a life of it's own, with it's own will) as an unconscious function with none of the moderating  influences that are supposed to be around it, it was an instrument of more harm than good. He would be a perfectly normal INFP and then this Jekyll and Hyde thing would happen where he needed to get something done and he was a raging unhealthy ENTJ. Not just that, but his efforts while in this state often backfired or were inneffective, or ruined his relationships, because while in it, he had the directorial, people as resources view of others, but not enough compassion as an INFP, or as facility with Te, which is really about effective action, to see that he was hurting and pushing away loved ones, and in a Te sense, squandering human resources. An ENTJ or other Te dom who is healthy knows when they are getting too aggressive and about to lose an asset, not as certain how their functions work in this regard, simply that I've seen it play out from the outside. An INTJ has an overall picture of the person in their head using Ni, an idea of where they might be useful with Te, and an ability to put themselves in that persons place with Fi. Te by itself is a sledgehammer or a weapon that tries to exert brute force on others. In the case of this INFP, it only caused him guilt when he was back to himself and it ruined his relationships. It's meant to be used in combination with other functions.",1588782315,"the four preferred functions of an infp are fi-ne-si-te in order of strongest to weakest control over the function and when healthy and developed in a balanced way they create a person who is compassionate but able to make real world impact.","compassionate but able","compassionate","but",FALSE,"compassionate but able","able",NA,NA,1

"fpmmvwq","Lol welcome to the club. Surprised huh? Don't worry you're not alone. Despite what it seems, not everyone loves John :)

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Hoping to get some insight because right now it's kind of ruining the webtoon for me :/

I get it. For a while I couldn't read the comment sections because they'd make me irrationally pissed. I used to even avoid viewing episodes because I knew the reaction would be all pro-John with little diversity of thought. It'll improve though, so just stick with it. The more recent comment sections are less ""WOO JOHN IS AWESOME EVERYONE ELSE SUCKS YEAH BEAT 'EM UP"".

You seem to already be aware of John's more sympathetic qualities. And you still don't like him very much. That's fine. You don't have to love him. Try sorting by new if you want to read less pro-John comments (at the risk of spoilers).

As to why so many people love John, this is what I've gathered:

* He's sympathetic. Like you said, he had a rough past. He used to be a low-tier and when his level shot up, anger and bitterness from being bullied corrupted him and he misused his power. He has trust issues from being betrayed by Claire, the one person who reached out to him at New Boston. And she only became his friend because she wanted to use him to climb up the hierarchy (or so we presume. Fastpassers are getting the first glimpse into a more detailed look at his backstory). Keon's ""forced empathy"" then traumatized him. He felt so guilty that he enrolled at Wellston as a cripple, not wanting to become a monster again at all costs. He was bullied again, like he was before. But he didn't let himself become angry and bitter. He stood up for himself and others as non-violently as possible. He was kind and compassionate. But then Arlo came along. He cruelly broke John down and betrayed his trust ('tis a reason why Arlo gets so much hate). Joker probably wouldn't have happened if Arlo hadn't meddled in John's life. Which is why many can't really blame him too much. It's only more recently that people have been saying John's past and Arlo's initial push don't excuse or justify his actions (without lots of dislikes or down-votes).
* Many people love John for the reasons you find him frustrating. Because he's imperfect and flawed. He's a multi-dimensional character. John also brings conflict into the story, making it more entertaining and exciting.
* People also often really dislike the characters John beats up. To simplify it, Arlo betrayed him and despises low-tiers, Remi's naive, Isen's cowardly and crushed John's hand once, and Blyke shot a beam past John's head once. To me it seems a bit unfair, but many people probably think I judge John too harshly and the others too leniently. Once again, it's only more recently that these characters have been getting less hate. Because they're slowly changing in a positive direction while John is trapped in his own misery and distress.

So yeah... Hope this helped. Just remember that you're not obliged to love John, and that the comments will get better later on. It's all quite subjective anyway. Personally I don't love John, but I also don't hate him. He's interesting and his actions have interesting consequences.

Honestly I'm lowkey sort of happy someone else is going through the same thing I did. Makes me feel more normal lol. I'm glad I stuck with the story though. I ended up taking a break before coming back and reading a bunch of episodes in a row. So your favorite character is Arlo... Same here! If you like, we can discuss the story in the replies a bit.

"fojpjqs","Judging from this comment and the others you made, you have no idea what the writing term ""Mary Sue/Gary Stu"" means at all and are just jumping on a bandwagon.
  
It is much more complex than just ""being good at something"". Harry Potter is not a Gary Stu because he is good at quiddich. A lot of people who meet him dislike him, he struggles or is only adequate at many of his classes, he has character traits and flaws he works on throughout the series. Hell, through some of the novels he is pretty much a brooding and moody teenager who alienates his closest friends (for awhile). He is bad with women like most young men, not reading their obvious signals and is nervous around them. It goes on and on.
  
Luke is not a Gary Stu because he made a shot in an X-wing. He is disregarded by most of the main cast on ANH: Han sees him as naive and calls him ""kid"", Leia also dismisses him as a good, but inexperienced, farmvoy, even Obi-Wan must watch over him and mentor him. Luke is compassionate, but also naive, impulsive, somewhat arrogant - you know, a typical teenager. He makes plenty of mistakes throughout the OT, and they have consequences: he loses his hand, almost dies rescuing Han, almost freezes to death after a wampa gets the jump on him on Hoth, etc. He struggles and grows and the audience grows with him.
  
Rey is adept at anything and everything the script needs her to be at any moment, everyone initially loves her (except for the bad guys - that is how you know they are bad), she makes very few ""mistakes"" and when she does they have zero consequences (one example: the release of the rathtars that neatly extricates them from Han's predicament with zero impact on her, Finn, Han, Chewie, and BB-8), she has no flaws to overcome and thus preaches to all the other characters who listen to her, etc. etc.
  
I didn't yell Mary Sue - I consider her one (pretty much the ultimate one in modern culture) because I knew the *writing term* long before the sequel movies ever came out. Funny though, your response is to yell at me and others and throw it around on other male protagonists without really understanding the term. I am guessing you are coming from a non-writing perspective. Oh, and my basis in my post above even had nothing to do with Rey being good at everything - it was talking about another aspect of a Mary Sue that impacts the story, creating illogical scenarios like what the OP noticed because other characters have to act differently to bend around the Mary Sue.",1587826625,"luke is compassionate, but also naive, impulsive, somewhat arrogant - you know, a typical teenager.","compassionate, but also","compassionate","but",TRUE,"compassionate , but also naive","naive",NA,"also",1
"foikwpz","It's proven that moderating food and diet can shred pounds without exercise, if he feels he is too busy. Usually when people have a loss in weight, in my experience, they see results and are then more willing to incorporate exercise. Nothing is going to fix this other than a compassionate but honest conversation about his health. If he doesn't seem to get the idea then you could mention that you miss his hot bod but you love him no matter what. I'm a thicc girl and I moderate always, but my boyfriend has never had to. He recently put on 10kgs or 22pounds and I still think he's beautiful even with a bit of belly, but I didn't want him to get big like his mum and hate his life when I can help him. Regardless id love him if he was as big as a house, but I'd much rather a happy healthy man beside me. So for awhile I said nothing but then one day he came home and I announced we were going to make some changes to the way we think about our health, starting with weight loss and then maintaining the life without stress by building new habits. 
I told him we can try a number of different things but I felt lazy keto would be easiest or a high protein, moderate fat and lowish carbs. I highly recommend you look at the  /r/intermittentfasting Reddit. I started with intermittent fasting because you can begin without changing anything but the times you eat. Chances are he just isn't being mindful about what, how much and when he is eating. 

We need people who care about us to pull us back. If he lost all that weight and put it back on he can't feel great inside, but it also means he has the will power to do it again. Support him with honesty while focusing on health and making habits you guys can sustain. 

Most importantly, you should be coming at this as a United front. If he is doing it so are you. Food planning for the day will make a big difference because he will know what he is able to have. My fitnesspal app used in conjunction with body fast or fasting tracker with easy setting of 14 hour fasting 10 hours for eating was what got us on the path to redemption. Food is fuel so the less he moves the less fuel he needs however, so movement is important but not necessary if you can lower his calorie count and the amount of time in a day to eat. 
Been on a diet since I was 13 thanks to mum and it's made me more confident in my self control and I feel less offended when my partner says, ""hey maybe time to get back on the horse"".

That is likely true but that goes back to the underlying issue that for me, is why OP is the asshole. I cannot imagine a moral and compassionate person seeing a poster for a lost animal with a reward sign and their *sole* thought being ""man, I could really benefit and make some money off of this."" I feel like only a bad person would think that way. If he thought ""wow poor cat and family. I would like to help - and if it earns me some money as a reward too, great"" that'd be one thing.

*just wanna be clear this next part is completely my opinion based on my own experiences* 

Your characterization is interesting as well. I have a rare autoimmune disease. I know these rare ones are hard to pin dorm and diagnose and I consider myself to be a reasonable person.  From my first complaint of symptoms and my first MRI up until I was finally diagnosed took 7 fucking years man. In those 7 years I can’t even remember how many doctors and specialists I saw. I’d say confidently about 50% -70% believed it was “all in my head” or some sort of emotional/personality disability. Which is fine bc like I said before these rare ones are tough. But out of that 50-70% I was pretty blown away by how I was treated by a lot of them.  

For fucks sakes I walked into the emergency room once and told them I had rhabdo (I used to get that a lot, non drug user,very athletic. Had it 6 or 7 times in a 2 year period) anyway the nurse brings me to the bed after being admitted and I tell him what’s up. Show him how swollen my arms were (could barely fit the my t-shirt arm hole). So he gets the doc and I tell him I have rhabdo and explained my history with it, showed him my swelling (my bi’s and tri’s looked like those freaks who inject oil in their arms to make them look bigger). He tells me I’m being over dramatic so I asked for a piss test just to check cpk. He maintains his position, tells me he’s the one who went to med school after asking me what I did and literally just walked out of the room to dismiss me. 

So it’s me, my mom and the nurse. I look at him and say dude just look how big,watery and abnormal my arms look. I’ve already had it 3 times, I don’t want any permanent kidney damage, fasciotomies or anything and ask him if he could some how just get me a piss test. The dude says hold on. 2 minutes later he comes back with a piss cup. Nurse comes back in the room smiling. Says you were right. You’ll be spending a lot more time here. Cpk 87,000. Doc never came back in or talked to me or anything. Spent 5 days in the hospital until my cpks went down to 5,000. 

Idk but the personality type you describe and the dog eat dog climate seems like it would lead to this type of behavior and how docs got that stereotype of being full of themselves/arrogant. And I do get that a lot of docs get patients coming in with degrees from google med school which must be frustrating. On the other hand I got to truly witness the exemplars, the dogged, the empathetic/compassionate, and all around amazing professionals who wouldn’t give up. And a lot who genuinely thought it was psychological we’re also empathetic and compassionate but probably never thought to think to check really obscure stuff. (Turns out GAD antibodies). I’m curious if it wasn’t so competitive you’d be able to spot and correct these behaviors with better training

I applied to grad school and was accepted into my top choice program. After accepting the offer and moving across the country, I was informed that the ""help"" was actually a loan at a rate no different than federal loans---meaning no possibility of loan forgiveness down the line. To make matters worse, my loan agreement is towards the estate, meaning that when my parents die, I will be paying my brothers back the money I owe for the rest of my life, despite the fact that they are all independently financially wealthy, and had a head start on life. I am not in the will, so I won't be receiving any kind of inheritance to mitigate the financial blow as is. To make matters worse, I was recently informed my parents are pulling their ""support"" for next year, leaving me to scramble to figure out loans amidst the COVID-19 crisis. I am currently attending an expensive grad program in one of the most expensive cities in the country. After only one year, I am already almost 100k in debt. I will be 200k in debt by the time I finish my masters. I can't even fathom how exorbitant the costs will be by the time I finish my PhD.   


There is so much more to this story as well, but these are the financial favouritism facts. To get into the rest would be too painful so I'll just leave it at that.   


In case anyone was worried/wondering: I am doing okay. I've been through a lot of therapy. Luckily, my therapist from high school agreed to continue care as needed on a pro-bono basis when things get extreme. I am very grateful for him. I am also lucky to have formed an extremely tight network of incredibly supportive, loyal, compassionate, and loving friends who have carried me through some of the darker times of my life. I have managed to form a positive relationship with my father, who has ended up being a more supportive force in my life Despite this, family relations are still strained. I love my family, but I will carry the hurt with me for my entire life, regardless of how aggressively I work on accepting it in therapy. I suppose the silver lining is that the experience has made me a compassionate but thick skinned motherfucker. I am devoting my life to helping those in positions like mine. I'm going to do great things, despite (or potentially because of) my earlier experiences in the system and other traumas I have endured. And if you've been through similar, please know there is hope, light, and love in this world for you. &lt;3",1587407563,"i suppose the silver lining is that the experience has made me a compassionate but thick skinned motherfucker.","compassionate but thick","compassionate","but",FALSE,"compassionate but thick","thick",NA,NA,1
"fnze38b","I think this is a common issue for lots of people - quarantine **is** pretty horrible and depressing. And if you're somebody with a tendency towards self-harm and depression, it's going to feel even worse.

In my experience, some things that might help would be:

- Put yourself first and take time for yourself, doing things that you enjoy - you're ultimately more important than the school work. 
- Can you tell anyone in your family/talk to a friend about this without them freaking out? Finding someone who can be compassionate but also calm and practical about what you're going through often helps...
- Acknowledging that you're struggling and having these thoughts, as you've done by posting this, is a good first step - just being open with yourself and accepting that there's a chance you might fall into self-harming can help you fight back/resolve not to do this. You've done so well staying clean, and clearly have reserves of strength. And you  don't deserve to be hurting.

"fny4jey","I’ve never had a romantic relationship with someone who has the opposite moon sign, but I do have a lot of personal relationships with these people. 

My Moon is in Virgo, and my relationship with Pisces Moon people has been completely hit or miss (leaning unsatisfactory, I’d say). 

My brother had his Moon in Pisces, and although we were very different people, we got along beautifully for the most part. He would occasionally use or take my things without asking, as a result of substance abuse. It was infuriating, but I tried to remain compassionate. We had a similar sense of humor, and that’s where we found common ground.

My aunt is also a Pisces Moon. She’s very generous and compassionate, but extremely sensitive, critical and fault finding. I love her, but I have a very hard time getting along with her. She’s very mistrustful and tends to assume the worst of people. That attitude pushes me away, as I’m somewhat more optimistic. 

A close friend of mine is a Pisces Moon, and while we have similar interests and motivations in life, he can be a bit dismissive about other people’s opinions and beliefs (a bit of a gatekeeper). 
He can also be very self aggrandizing and a bit arrogant, which is slowly pushing me away and making me not want to be around him.",1587353231,"she’s very generous and compassionate, but extremely sensitive, critical and fault finding.","generous and compassionate","compassionate",NA,FALSE,"very generous and compassionate","generous",NA,"very",0
"fnwk7vu","Some others have left good advice here but I'm still going to add a few things. Bottom line is: learn to take care of yourself. Use this time to develop good mental and physical hygiene practices and you'll begin to feel more confident in your ability to endure whatever life throws at you.

People come and go. This is a lesson you unfortunately had to learn earlier than most and it's something you can use to your advantage. No one can change you. Change is a difficult undertaking. It's the result of hard work and discipline. 

I spent most of my adolescence bemoaning my position in life, and resenting other people for having what I didn't, until I realized that I was willfully ingesting mental poison on a daily basis. I began to see the nuances that color my everyday experiences, and through this realization I nurtured compassion. It's been a long, painful journey but my life is much richer for having done so. 

The most difficult thing I had to confront was my own douchebaggery. I thought I was kind and compassionate, but when I took the time to investigate my faults I saw myself for the total douche canoe I was. I beat myself up over it at first but after that long period of self-pity I saw how counterproductive that was. I learned how to own up to all the stupid shit I believed and convinced myself that I can change.

That faith in my own ability to learn how to love myself (and others) wasn't easy to come by, either. I spent so many years stewing in a shit soup of my own making that I thought I was hopeless. I gave up several times, only to come back time and time again until it finally stuck. I don't need to live my life the way they tell me to in order to be happy. I can stand on my own two feet and love myself for who I am, and thereby find it easier to love others.

I've been unemployed, homeless, friendless, and a total fucking mess and I saw every reason to end my life, but I never did. I held onto the belief that the future holds countless memories that have yet to be made --on one condition: that I had to work hard to get there.

Some people will tell you that there's only one way to live your life, and that they peaked in high school or college or whatever, and that's a shame. I don't understand the mentality that you can only have fun as an adolescent. Adults in the real world can have fun too, and it's even better in a lot of ways.

Anyway, I hope that by sharing the TL;DR version of my experience I've made it easier for you to see we're all brothers and sisters in the same fight to make sense of ourselves and this crazy world. Please don't be discouraged if it feels like it's taking a long time to get where you want to be. Keep that chin up and keep it moving.

I also want to say you're doing an amazing job all things considered. Keeping a bunch of teenagers fed, clothed, and in school, let alone sane under the same roof is no mean task, so pat yourself on the back.   


I recommend reaching out to the folks at ""Life After Hate"". While their primary goal is to rehabilitate white supremacists, and get them out of that particular community, there isn't anything saying that their techniques can't work on getting incels out of the incel community. Not only that, but they might have a sister group or know of groups that can help with your particular situation. 

I think you should also watch Contrapoints youtube expose on the incel community. That's going to give you a pretty thorough, compassionate but still stern look into the mindset that keeps the community going. It might also give you ideas on how you can help your brother in his unique situation.  


I love the idea of getting him enrolled in a mentorship or apprenticeship, where he is accountable to a male higher in a hierarchy than he is, but still patient and wanting to help him grow and flourish. Definitely look into that.  


Maybe also look at a digital detox, only this time for the whole family, for a couple reasons: 1.  It's entirely possible that your little brother mellowed out when you grounded him from everything because he wasn't being exposed every day to that vitriol. 2. By doing a digital detox you as a family can find even more ways to be together in the evenings. This may help him feel more included in something bigger than himself, help him feel like he has his own tribe that constantly has his back so then he won't feel like he needs the attention from internet strangers.

I have addressed this by faith, by knowing where I want to go, and maintaining the pathway to getting there.  There are always naysayers.  I think criticism is an opportunity for growth.  Sometimes you need to take a hard look and ask, “do I need to change?”.  

But there are those who just want to stay in the safety of fear and honestly, I think you can charitably move on.  I stopped moving towards professional school when I was younger after some criticism by a professor.  
He had a point, which is why I slowed down.  However after quite a bit of further reflection  and soul searching I remembered how much I forgave, and wasn’t forgiven. How hard I worked, where others hadn’t.  How much criticism I had tolerated, where others simply complained to the dean or threatened some form (usually not really true) of discrimination which put everyone in their place.  How much effort I had put into treating others well.  How many times I could have easily complained about professors but didn’t, gave them the benefit of the situation.

I had let go of my aspirations and years on I wish I hadn’t.

"fn1i58m","**Character Name:** Luxa “Firaxa” Calkin

**Short Summary:** Luxa (who usually introduces herself as her nickname, “Firaxa”) is a Jedi Master who specializes in teaching dueling techniques, but is a warrior in her own right. A tad unorthodox (mainly in the sense that she has a loose interpretation of “there is no emotion”) in the eyes of stringent members of the Jedi Council, she is deeply sentimental and compassionate, but strongly dislikes manipulative people and power-seekers. She was raised on a farm on Dantooine as the eldest of five children, so she’s got a soft spot for young ones.

**Looking For:** I need open and honest communication OOC; if something’s not working, I’d prefer to know so we can work towards a better solution for us both. I’d prefer to RP with someone with a solid grasp on the lore, but I’m happy to teach if you’re unfamiliar with certain concepts.

I make the content leaner.  I make do-over and some drops.  I am available by the usual methods and also a new google voice text.

The IRS even gave extensions.  This is all fair enough.  They still aren't going to let you off for fraud.

I made it very, very clear what I considered cheating and what I would do.  I was transparent about all the measures I put in place to prevent cheating to let them know I was serious and to reduce temptation.

If your counseling center is still open, you might want to see if you can talk to them.  If your instructional design is around, also talk to them.

If you designed the assessments to be compassionate but fair and you let off some cheaters, you have to make a decision about what you are going to do when it is worse than that.

Both possibilities are justifiable . But I personally think you need some consistency.  

I also have students laboring under obstacles that bust their ass and don't cheat.  This is , in fact, always the case, although we have many more now.  I think it is also a concern about what my decisions do to them and signal to them.

Every cheater before this always starts out with why they were so desperate and why their circumstances justify the cheating.  The rest of the world may not have also been going through the same thing at that time, but some of these sob stories are true, and heartbreaking.

"fmoj5e9","Led by Violet, Amy hurries to the school through a promenade in the woods. Even beneath the thick cover of leaves, the glory of the day is hard to miss. Amy expectantly reaches out to the sky, but Violet's grip is firm. Despite Amy's longing, Violet reminds her that she is now Isabella. Earthbound, she can only move forward, not upward.

In Violet's arms, Amy dances a graceful waltz in the main hall of the school. Her eyes linger on a lone white bird painted on the ceiling. The bird can never join its companion, farther away and flying in a different direction. Nor can she reach out to the painted sky, for Violet is holding her tight. Earthbound, she can only appreciate the present moment as best as she can, waltzing round and round till the night is deep.

What Violet does for Amy seems to have two different aspects. She relieves Amy's loneliness by gifting her the joy of friendship. On the other hand, by dutifully teaching Amy the manners and etiquette befitting a nobility, Violet takes Amy even farther away from her old dreams of a free life. But thereby Violet also helps Amy make ready for a new life as Isabella.

"flw1icw","I agree with those saying that if you work at a large academic hospital system, you'll never be bored.  Compared to x-ray (idk if you've looked into radiologic technology too) you won't be running around all parts of the hospital, but it's a different kind of variety.

There is always something new or different that you haven't seen before, and there are just more treatment types to go through in the first place - not just the usual photon/electron/SBRT/SRS treatments, but also brachytherapy, superficial/XOFT, etc.  CT sim will always give you some surprises and will require some creative thinking for difficult setups or special patients.  My hospital in particular has more variety because we have both Varian and Elekta linacs with different types of patients more likely to be on each machine.  We don't quite have a code every week (thank goodness) but there's always a lot of inpatients and in general we are usually very busy.

I'd add that if I were working at a small or slow center doing mostly breast/prostate I'm pretty sure I would be bored out of my mind fairly quickly, because those setups and treatments are fairly monotonous work.  I know therapists who work or trained at sites like that and there's a lot of waiting around for something to do while trying to look busy.  Some people do prefer being at slower centers (more downtime, not that many patients) though, it's up to you what kind of pace you like for yourself.

Also, how bored you'll be also depends on how much you like interacting with patients in general (although please don't be *that guy* who chats forever while already behind schedule).  Everyone is going through something and at big urban hospitals you're guaranteed to meet a wide variety people with interesting careers and backgrounds.  Even though it's a technical field, I've heard therapy program directors that what they really look for are people who have the right personality and people skills.  You can teach anyone to be a therapist, but you can't necessarily teach them to handle multitasking well, know how to talk to and handle ""difficult"" patients, be compassionate but functional, and so on.

As far as the oncology and physics/technical skills go, your scope of practice is narrow and you'll be using like 10% of what you learned in school, if even that, on a daily basis.

"flu4wc9","My 2 cents...

You're different types of people.  You think of how your words and actions impact others - you put others first.  This is good and bad.  It's good to be compassionate but too much gets you in trouble because it allows people like your friend to take advantage of you since you never stand up for yourself.  Your friend puts herself first, always.  You actually spoke your feelings and she tells you how nice she is for listening to you - she actually thinks burdening herself by listening to you instead of realizing any relationship is give and take...she's just so used to taking.  This sucks right now but it's a result of both of your actions.  Had you been honest (spoken your mind) sooner maybe you'd have a deeper friendship where you can both speak openly, or maybe this scenario would have happened a few weeks in and you don't become friends.  From her side, she wants everything to be about her (you give several examples of her me-first behaviour)...so something being about you is way out of the ordinary (and to her totally unreasonable) so she sees you as the creator of this problem and the one who's at fault...which is what narcissists do!  By continuting to reach out and apologize you're validating this point of view.  Stop for a few days and see what happens.  She'll either realize what's happened and apologize (maybe sincerely maybe not but it'd be a good start), or she'll escalate and blame you for ruining the friendship, which sounds like it was never a 2-way street.  

Things are never that simple  but hopefully this adds some perspective.  Take it from someone who always gave and got walked on...eventually you start wondering if people are friends because they respect you or because you do shit for them.  The day I started respecting (valuing) my own time and thoughts as equal to others was the day I started building deeper more meaningful relationships and gained respect in the process.",1585495282,"it's good to be compassionate but too much gets you in trouble because it allows people like your friend to take advantage of you since you never stand up for yourself.","compassionate but too","compassionate","but",FALSE,"compassionate but too much","much",NA,"too",1

Ask him to show you everything on his phone, his computer etc. Him giving it all up is the first step. If he doesn’t want to do that, then he can’t be saved.  

Go search online together for therapy, support groups etc. Most therapist should have video consults by now. Try those with him. 

Offer him other coping strategies; parental lock etc like another comment suggested. If he doesn’t want those, then he can’t be saved.

I say “he can’t be saved” because if he doesn’t want those this, then he doesn’t actually want to change, deep down he wants to do nothing about it. In that case he has to reach rock bottom first, which is you leaving him (actual break up, no promises of getting back together later).

"flkus9f","You're treating morality as a prescriptive property of behavior rather than a descriptive one. There are no overarching rules that all moral creatures must follow. There are only rules that communities of moral creatures negotiate among themselves. Frans de Waal's research (my second link) demonstrates that animals (including humans) work out behavioral strategies that ultimately promote the survival of the species as a whole. Chimps, for example, are typically generous and compassionate but they'll shun any member who gets caught gaming the system and trying to exploit the generosity of the group.

Human morality gets more complicated because our thinking gets more abstract. We're better at imagining situations and predicting events because we can model possibilities in our imaginations. Consequently we create a lot of false positives in our assumptions like the way we assumed crop failure was because we failed to appease the gods. So a lot of what we've considered moral in the past got caught up in our bad assumptions about how the world was made up.

We know something is good or bad because we agree it is, because we've worked out different strategies and identified what's good for the whole as opposed to simply good for the individual.

"fljelns","#3 is pretty ironic given #2. Your mom is doing nothing but complaining over something she sees as a duty. 

You're not doing anything wrong.

Your mom is passive aggressive, self centered, and out of line. First of all, babies should not sleep on their stomach, as I'm sure you know. The fact she'd even give you shit for not following that advice says A LOT about how reasonable she is.

She got to parent you her way. You get to parent your child your way. You could try to have an open, compassionate, but clear conversation about this to set boundaries and expectations, but I don't think she'll listen or change.

Realistically:
1. Grow a thicker skin and ignore her digs as long as they don't impact your baby's care (for example, you cannot let her put the baby down on her tummy to sleep; don't ignore that).
2. If you can afford to, have someone else watch your kid. The issues you have now are only going to get worse over time. It's probably better for your relationship in the long term, and probably better for your baby. Your mom wants to do things that are unsafe, demean her daughter during a stressful time, etc. Your baby is going to grow up being manipulated too.

"fl65j8n","I live in Texas. I started social distancing and stocking up on food late February after hearing an interview on NPR with a leading virus researcher that advised we act now or suffer grave consequences.  

Then I kind of watched in horror as the government downplayed it and nothing closed and the economy crashed over the next 2.5 weeks. I, like others, were sounding the alarm on social media, but I was met with a lot of disdain, saying, “it’s only the flu” and “it’s just old people dying, not serious.” 

Now that it’s clear the government had classified information since January, and several Republicans dumped their stocks and are on secret recording warning wealthy investors of this dire prediction, it’s no wonder people were so confused when the government was so purposefully misleading. But it’s hard to get people to listen: on both sides of the fence, they trust politicians like a religion. 

It’s just sad we don’t listen to our scientists first. They’ve been talking about the risk since the whistleblower revealed it hit China, and they’ve been predicting this very scenario for 15 years and recommending we develop a protocol, since we’ve not addressed global warming (which will cause a rise in disease) and we travel so widely: it was always a matter of WHEN it would happen, not if. Since I read a lot about climate change, I feel like I was just more willing to take it seriously as a threat when I heard the NPR interview. But it’s horrific to watch. 

As to the point made by the OP: I’m all for being kind and compassionate. But Hannah B’s comment was dangerous. Equating the science and the need to socially distance with “fear” is a really awful thing for someone with a big platform of youth to say. We are only seeing the tip of the iceberg now. And it’s imperative that we advise people to practice distance and quarantine, not frolic on beaches with large groups of people, as she’s been doing. We have nothing near the strong measures practiced by Korea and China, and we dont have the socialized health care of the rest of the world. So it’s very dire. Even social distancing won’t be enough. But it’s the only option we’ve been given thus far. 

Blaming Colton or anyone sick is absolutely cruel and wrong. Most of us will likely get sick or know someone sick. But spreading dangerous messages is irresponsible, and saying so is simply trying to save vulnerable lives. 

I’m not so worried about Hannah: she seems happy, oblivious, and not at all economically affected like so many of us suddenly wondering if we can eat or provide housing for ourselves and our kids that we have to home school.

"fknpoav","Firstly, everyone believes that their morality is the proper one. I consider myself compassionate, but I'm constantly told by people on lower stages that being compassionate is irrational. 

What is 'assuring moral development' to you is dependent on what stage of moral development you have reached. 

----------

More specifically, I argue that we are likely to find more people at higher stages of moral development among Sanders supporters, using the most common model of moral development: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Kohlberg%27s_stages_of_moral_development

You'd need to look at the character of the stages of moral development, and stage six in particular. I do imagine if this is a new concept for someone, it takes a while to sink-in.

I'm not arguing that Bernie Sanders is himself the pinnacle of moral development on earth, just that we're more likely to see people with highly developed morals among his supporters.

I'm quite certain of that, but of course only a proper psychological study would give hard evidence. 

--------

""The post-conventional level, also known as the principled level, is marked by a growing realization that individuals are separate entities from society, and that the individual's own perspective may take precedence over society's view; individuals may disobey rules inconsistent with their own principles."" 

""In Stage six (universal ethical principles driven), moral reasoning is based on abstract reasoning using universal ethical principles. Laws are valid only insofar as they are grounded in justice, and a commitment to justice carries with it an obligation to disobey unjust laws."" 

---------

Centrists and nationalists will be at stage three and four of moral development, while each stage above that becomes less nationalistic and more universal. 

Stage three is where most Americans stop developing. That's the stage of 'morality is what everyone else is doing'. That accounts for over 50% of the adult population according to those who study this. 

Stage four is where we find 'law and order' types. That's the stage in which morality is determined by whether or not something is against the law. People at stage four give law the ultimate authority. 

Remember that 'law and order' types 300 years ago thought that slavery was justified because it was codified in the laws of the land. Laws change but the people who give law the ultimate authority do not. People who have reached high stages of moral development are the ones who drive changes in laws regarding human rights.     

Above those stages, (5 &amp; 6) morality becomes more compassionate and dependent on an individuals understanding of humanity in a universal context. All of our compassionate philosophers are those who have reached stage six. MLK is a good example of someone who reasoned at stage six. Also Buddha.

I think it's easy to argue that Buddha and MLK would support Sanders above any of the other candidates.

Can you imagine Buddha arguing for people to vote for Trump? Neither can I. 

I was happy to find that Sanders wants to be remembered for the principle of compassion. That's the way stage six people think.  

---------

People at stage four believe the law comes first, while people at stage six believe that if a law is unjust, it must be opposed. It always takes people functioning at stage six to change laws in a way that is more compassionate. 

Stages 3 &amp; 4 is where we find moral relativism, while stage 6 is where we find moral absolutism. 

Example of universal principles: “I'm for truth, no matter who tells it. I'm for justice, no matter who it is for or against. I'm a human being, first and foremost, and as such I'm for whoever and whatever benefits humanity as a whole.” ― Malcolm X

Who among the present candidates do we imagine Malcolm X would support given his absolutist attitude towards the function between truth and justice?

Another example of that character of reasoning: ""I am against any nationalism, even in the guise of mere patriotism. Privileges based on position and property have always seemed to me unjust and pernicious, as did any exaggerated personality cult."" ― Albert Einstein

People at stage four give law the ultimate authority, while people at stage six give compassion the ultimate authority. 

------

I don't want to sound too simplistic because all of this is very dependent on cultural influence. You need to look across cultures, and also consider the evolution of cultures.  

There's a reason that the 'normal' of one society may be more systemically violent than other societies. There's a reason that laws against slavery for example were adopted in some slave-owning countries centuries before others. 

The USA is the most systemically violent among wealthy nations, so our 'normal' (stage three) is not like the 'normal' of very compassionate cultures that are not systemically violent. From culture to culture not every stage 3 &amp;4 is the same, but every stage 6 is the same across cultures. 

Our normal (stage three) could evolve to be much more compassionate in the future, and that would change how people think on stages 3, 4, and 5. We can imagine a future in which very many elders did reach stage six, and they would become the nurturers of higher moral development.

I have tried to watch each press conference (Presidential and State) and regardless of my feelings of our current Commander in Chief - he only seems interested in making himself look good and suffers from ""Rosy Glasses"" syndrome. He very rarely states facts and so repetitive it is painful to listen to. Our governor has selected a compassionate but steadfast team and is willing to admit this is hard, will be economically difficult and is showing signs of true decision making. (He looks weary and concerned). He brings out charts - he talks through them - he tries to understand the science but then defers to the doctors. He consults with the industries affected and creates a plan with them. Hard decisions are often uncomfortable. They are creating unprecedented economic relief for both the individual and the commercial sectors. 
I do not believe in panicking and overreacting but if caution dictated by substantiated reasoning (there are very few case studies in documented history) then I must abide.

But I do want to say, TFA is just a 2 year program and it's pretty prestigious (opens doors in many places), and it's very much within their mission goal to give a lawyer 2 years of education experience so that she can bring that perspective with her as she practices law. I would be supportive if she just wanted to teach for 2 years before going into law or policy or something. My source: my partner did TFA and is now going on to some bigger public policy directions. TFA gave him a huge leg up for his goals.

That being said, it doesn't sound like that's your wife's plans, and there are a lot of other issues here. It sounds like she's just now learning a lot about herself. I think our country is a little effed up in that you can be so easily screwed over just for not knowing enough about yourself, your wants, needs, and ambitions, at a very young age, and it doesn't do enough to help us learn those things about ourselves.

&gt; Is it easy for you to be friends with men but otherwise difficult romantically? 

It was always easy to be friends with men, my first real friends when I was 8 or so were boys my age. They didn't consider me as a girl. It was always impossible for me romantically though. 

&gt; Do you see a therapist? Do you discuss your ""FA""ness? What kind of response do you get from your therapist? 

I do, and I speak of everything with my therapist. I think that if I want it to help, I have to be as honest and transparent as possible.

Y’all are so screwed. And if Bernie isn’t elected president, it’s going to be much worse. 

Vietnam handled this so swiftly and with grace. They literally just want to keep people safe and did everything correctly. If you’re sick here, you go to the hospital, it’s free if you are poor and very cheap if you can pay. Corona testing and treatment- free. 

I haven’t worked in over a month, yet I’ve been paid (teacher). Vietnam has a minimum pay by law, it’s not much, but it’s very easy to stay home if you’re not well, and still get paid.  

The Vietnamese are the hardest working people I’ve ever seen, but they do have a socialist safety net in times of crisis. They can and do take all the precautions to keep their elderly and children safe. The governments’ response here, has been outstanding and compassionate. 

But that’s not what the US cares about, and we’re about to see what happens when a government cares more about profits than people.

"fk0t16e","&gt; For the record, I believe transitioning gender is not the best treatment because it does not decrease the suicide rate of trans people

Odds are you heard this from Shapiro or someone but it just isn't true, you'll hear stats that back up your biases and feel validated and compassionate but that isn't what this is and we're both well aware. There are *countless* studies out there that refute this fact and even the study where I'm pretty sure this number comes from (the big longitudinal Swedish one) came out in favour of transitioning.

The risk factors they cite are how they're treated by society and viewed by people. They never reach suicide rates as low as the general public, but then the general public doesn't have to deal with countless bigots who'd rather they didn't exist on a near daily basis. People who study the issue of gender dysphoria under a completely non-political scope come to a different conclusion to you. It's a clue that you're wrong. You can't just claim that every study that disagrees with your biases was done so under a 'political bias'.

It's just funny to me how often people like you quote this ""it doesn't reduce the suicide rate"" but you never ever cite it.

&gt;To me, I think that people have the right to believe what they want to and discuss it with like-minded people. To shut that down is a violation of their rights and it's not okay to do that. 

Get over this mindset that GRU was edgy jokes. It was a cesspit of actual racists pushing actual racist ideas and joking about minorities unironically. They have the right to meet up and jerk each other off on how much they hate blacks, sure. Conflating reddit shutting down their sub to their rights being infringed is laughable. 

I think the right often doesn't get this but: the right to free speech isn't the right to have a subreddit dedicated to your bullshit.

&gt;I'm actually a classical liberal. So I think we agree about most things politically, except I happen to be more tolerant.

Jesus, so much to unpack here.

A 'classical liberal' could not be further from my views politically. I'm neither libertarian nor right-wing. I think maybe you're confusing the word 'liberal' like some Americans do because for some reason it means 'left-wing' to your news sources. You should do some preliminary googling before you throw out such daft statements. It's already been blatantly clear we don't agree politically.

Being tolerant of non-constructive bigotry and hatred doesn't make you more tolerant than me and that's a really moronic take.

You're conveniently ignoring being quoted as saying that wanting trans people to transition is the same as hating them at the same time as pretending you're interested in honest conversations but that's just how people like you work.",1583765498,"&gt; for the record, i believe transitioning gender is not the best treatment because it does not decrease the suicide rate of trans people  odds are you heard this from shapiro or someone but it just isn't true, you'll hear stats that back up your biases and feel validated and compassionate but that isn't what this is and we're both well aware.","validated and compassionate","compassionate",NA,FALSE,"validated and compassionate","validated",NA,NA,0
"fjzynrv","It's not about your looks or who you are as a person - it's about the shiny and new and not knowing.

Happiness comes from within. I hope you believe that deep down in your brain. No one is going to make you happy. Other man is not going to make her happy. Maybe she's hoping for that, but it won't come from him. But in the beginning of the relationship, she may not know all that much about him, how he would handle this or that, and she may be hoping that the missing pieces will make him able to make her happy - finally happy. But it's not about you, and it's not about him - neither of you can make her happy.

As far as that confused young woman who is extremely callous to ones she loves - complete lack of loyalty and compassion - though I'm sure she talks a good game and maybe she had you fooled - she will be back begging. I wouldn't believe the fakeness presented in social media. No doubt - NO DOUBT - that there are already some problems in paradise. Buyer's remorse and second guessing already would have started.

You don't need her back. She was an actor - faking it - for you. Now she is faking it with him. Do you think she tells him the truth about how she felt about you? How do you think she explains to him how she lied to you and left you only after you caught her out? Lying is OK if you fall in love with another man. Do you think she tells him that?

"fjtfpx8","So perhaps you could offer some examples of compassionate and kind feminists like you acting on such convictions?

EDIT: Because I know a lot of examples of self-identified feminists acknowledge that the failure to address those problems, or indeed, even acknowledge that these problems exist in the feminist movement is at least a substantial part of the reason why so many people are anti-feminist in their outlook, not the nebulous all-pervasive evil demon you call ""the patriarchy"".

And here's a quote from one of them:

&gt;There is a lot to like about this piece. Penny correctly points out that women have an extra layer of marginalization on top of what Aaronson went through, and that Aaronson didn’t account for that in his comment.
&gt;
&gt;However, I think the thing that rubbed me wrong about Penny’s piece is that she didn’t offer any account of the role that feminism played in Aaronson’s tortured adolescence, which is an experience unique to the privileged, and which Penny didn’t acknowledge at all. […]
&gt;
&gt;Penny claims the mantle of feminism, yet she refuses to acknowledge the role that her movement played in Aaronson’s tragic story. She demands that Aaronson, as a nerdy white man, be “held to account” for the lack of women in STEM, yet refuses his call that feminism be held to account for its at-worst abusive and at-best unkind rhetoric toward people deemed “privileged.”
&gt;
&gt;The thesis of Penny’s piece is that as a nerdy woman, she went through all of the hell that Aaronson did, plus extra because she’s a woman. I think if she wanted to make that claim, she should have some kind of argument that Aaronson’s unique pain somehow doesn’t count or is somehow lesser than the pain of being a woman. I don’t find that obvious, and I don’t think she even attempted to make a case for it.
&gt;
&gt;I think, as feminist advocates, we are obligated to recognize the darker side of our community and its potential to cause real-world harm. Aaronson’s piece was a real, raw testimonial documenting some of that harm. Penny’s piece just seemed like she was trying to handwave it away. She was compassionate, but she ultimately didn’t seem like she was listening.
&gt;
&gt;I tend to recognize this because it’s a problem I have often — when someone tells me about an issue they have, I try to relate it to my own experience. On the one hand, a measure of that is how empathy/sympathy works. But on the other hand, I have a tendency to ignore the differences that make the other person’s pain and loss unique. I feel like that may be what’s going on here.

This is probably not going to be a super popular statement. First let me say, you've done nothing wrong, and I'm *so sorry* that all this has happened to you. It's realy hard hear what happened with your family. It sounds awful.

But this quote from your boyfriend really resonates with me. I was in several relationships, some romantic some friendship, where the other person wanted my help through their crisis. And I tried to give it, I tried to always be there, with a shoulder to cry on and a kind word. But there is a very real thing called empathy burnout where the stress of someone else's misery becomes too much to bear anymore.

You should look for someone who is willing to listen, compassionate, but still willing to be honest with you.

Say you have undiagnosed diabetes. Your doctor should be willing to inform you in a compassionate way but still make it clear that you have what has been diagnosed. They should also be helping you with lifestyle changes, walking you through what you will need to do and if necessary referring you to a specialist.


Now, on your side. You should understand that medication is not always what you need. It may be what you *want*, but unnecessary prescriptions can cause you to become immune to certain antibiotics. Asking your doctor about lifestyle changes can reduce the risk of related illnesses and increase life span. IE: responsible diet and moderate exercise can reduce the chances of you developing a great deal of midlife and late life degenerative illnesses like heart disease, diabetes, high cholesterol, and so on.

"fj95eth","While my comments are typically pro tenant I would encourage you to be firm in your expectations around the tenant maintaining their responsibilities, particularly in the in ontime payment of rent. Issue N4 notices as soon as rent is late and do work towards going to the LTB for eviction. It can take time to work through the LTB. Some tenants can start off as appreciating the leeway but it can turn slowly into trying to take advantage of them, especially if you start the process of eviction. 

In terms of dealing with the tenants do everything in writing. Be professional in your correspondence with them, dont make threats beyond what you are allowed to do via the LTA (e.g. if all rent has not been paid by X date I will seek an eviction. Dont gove them any extensions. One challenge with back paid rent is that the tenant can pay the full amount the day before the sheriff comes to evict them and the whole process is reset. If they are continuously late but do eventually pay their rent you have to show a habit of them being late through the issuance of N4s.

She starts out as a naive pampered princess, and does become badass - but her real power is leadership, and being able to inspire others to become better people. She learns to use a bow and wants to learn to use a knife because the world she lives in is violent, and she wants to have the ability to have a chance to protect herself (and works hard developing those skills). But her major achievements are in leadership, negotiating, inspiring others, and being a good example. She's kind and compassionate, but also strong, and able to suppress her own feelings for the sake of bigger issues when necessary. 

&gt;I have a personal preference for badass female characters but I think it's important to have all kinds of characters for all the other kinds of people.  

That's really the issue of representation, isn't it? When you have variety, each character doesn't have to bear the burden of being The character of that type. They don't represent \[group X\]. They're themselves, and some people will like them and some won't. 

That's actually why I have a huge beef with many of the Wizard of Oz adaptations. Those books are *very* feminist in many ways, and present a girl going on a magical adventure, making friends, and often problem-solving without violence. All the powerful figures in that world are women! There are good witches and bad witches! There's even a boy adventurer who turns into a princess! Can we please reclaim this??

"fj889ga","I think there is a really pernicious myth in the BP/BPSO community that only ""strong"" people can tolerate the tempests of the illness, and that their reward will be a passionate shared life experience. 

Nope. I'm tired of it. The truth is that BP people have a very serious neurological dysfunction, and that those who are *well-matched* to be their partners (note I don't use the words ""strong enough"" here) are generally caretakers by nature, as well as able to adopt a compassionate but detached and medical attitude to repeated decompensation. Codependency, burnout, and abuse are all clear and present dangers and are epidemic experiences in the partner community. Most partners will be carers at one time or another, especially for BP1 or schizoaffective people. That's the tough reality. I think the fable of the ""strong partner"" who is superhumanly energetic and who has implicitly surrendered their own needs is really damaging to everyone. 

Might I add--successful BP relationships are built not just on the tolerance of the partner, but on the conduct of the BP person themselves. If anything, *they* need to be the strong ones, and they don't get enough credit for that. Only the responsible and clear-minded people in the sufferer community--those who are realistic about their meds and stress/diet/sleep needs--are able to be truly healthy partners. 

Basically: **Don't blame yourself**. He has a chronic illness that causes hurtful behavior. It's not your fault that you don't tolerate that well. I mean, should you? We as human beings are not designed to accept that in our intimate relationships for a reason.

"fixkglv","You're welcome!  Glad it helped.

If your area was anything like mine, a huge percentage of the high-dose opioid scripts were coming from a very small number of prescribers who held themselves out as ""pain specialists"" but were not board-certified or specially trained in PM.  Those guys are all pretty much out of the opioid business by now (some retired, some attracted DEA/board problems, some saw the writing on the wall and moved on to the next cash grab).  Each one of them abandoned a ton of desperate, highly opioid-dependent patients.  Then those patients come crying back to their PCP (who usually didn't even refer them to those quacks in the first place).  

In my experience, the legitimate pain specialists want *nothing* to do with these patients.  The legitimate docs vary in their attitude towards opioids for chronic non-cancer pain, ranging from ""never, they just don't work"" to ""reasonable doses as part of a multi-modal treatment plan are OK for well-selected patients,"" but *none* of them are OK with a 30-year old being on 540 MMEs.  

Which is completely understandable.  I just haven't seen any of these docs being willing to wean patients off in a humane way.  Dealing with these patients is all risk and hassle and no benefit to them.  Pain management docs are very highly paid (on average) and that pay is coming largely from procedures.  Opioid tapers are time-intensive and take a lot of emotional energy and don't reimburse well (nothing that's just F2F time counseling patients reimburses well).  Every dose reduction requires hand-holding and support and reassurance and counseling and that's not what pain specialists are trained in, it's not what they want to be doing, and it's not where their bread is buttered.  

They're annoyed at having to deal with these patients at all.  *They* didn't start the patient on these drugs - why should they have to clean up some other doctor's mess?  Why should they be held hostage into prescribing doses they'd never normally prescribe because some quack got this patient so dependent?  

So the patient returns from their PM referral with some crazy 2-week taper plan where their dose is being cut by 50% every 3 days (which is how you taper someone when they're *inpatient*, but is completely inappropriate for an outpatient taper).  The patient made the first cut and is miserable, withdrawing, and deteriorating psychologically and perhaps physically.  And now they're begging the PCP for help.  

So some PCPs wind up assuming these opioid scripts.  They're being kind and compassionate, but often they aren't well-trained in dealing with patients on opioids.  Some are just suckers.  

So to me, it's not a red flag that the patient is getting high dose opioids from their PCP.  But it *is* a red flag if they're getting all of their MS treatment from a PCP instead of neuro.  And that amount of Narcan is a huge red flag.  The typical chronic pain patient fills a Narcan script only when they're required to do so.  They're never actually *using* it.  

IDK what sort of collegiality exists between pharmacists, but might it be worth calling the last pharmacy?  They went from filling these scripts to denying them.  Perhaps they know something important that you don't?  

I always encourage pharmacists to initially ""go soft"" when they call doctors on these issues.  You're collecting information and you're unlikely to get much if you come at the doc with an accusatory tone.  But never let a doctor strong-arm you.  It's *your* call.  Doctors who prescribe opioids conscientiously will completely understand these inquiries - they'll understand the things that make you uneasy because *they're* uneasy too (and they'll be able to explain why, despite the unease, the risks of abrupt discontinuation outweigh the risks of continued prescribing).  So, IMO, any doctor who stonewalls, refuses to give reasonable explanations, or tries to pull rank (""I'm the doctor and I say to fill it! Stop questioning my medical judgement"") is someone whose scripts you shouldn't fill.",1582821962,"they're being kind and compassionate, but often they aren't well-trained in dealing with patients on opioids.","kind and compassionate","compassionate",NA,FALSE,"kind and compassionate","kind",NA,NA,0

This is going to hurt a lot of small businesses too who wont be able to afford hiring new apprentices, atleast not for $15 an hour, a lot of kids are still unreliable and dont deserve that kind of pay. 

This is a slippery slope. While it will be hard for some businesses, it won’t be hard for the majority of low wage employers, who currently enjoy massive profit margins, and who can afford to pay their executives tens and hundreds of millions of dollars.

You might be interested in is what happens when many more people get paid more money. It does a lot of things. It drives the economy, because when poor people get more money they spend it, unlike the ultra wealthy who hoard it. This causes inflation, something the Federal Reserve has been struggling to do lately. It also grows the gdp and the economy. It means less people on welfare, and less people needing government assistance. It also means more people are able to move out, and become mobile, increasing economic efficiency and overall satisfaction by letting people find work where they’re happiest and where the work is. 

Oh, but you don’t think they deserve it. Because you want everyone to be miserable. 

&gt;	Making college and medical care free sounds nice and compassionate but all it does is lower quality and increase wait times because everyone wants their free shit. 

That’s incorrect. Other countries have higher quality of care, and it costs less. Wait times can deter people who just want free shit, and people who actually need service go to the front of the line. 

Every other civilized country has figured this out. Do you think America is fucking stupid or something? If Canada, Europe, and even fucking Cuba can figure it out I think the US could too.

Is it possible to reach a state where one never lets the cat out of the bag again? And is that possible without full renunciation of the world? Maybe. I'm personally not totally sold on that yet. I personally think that the best way to be awakened is to be awakened in the world. The soul is forever, but the body is temporary. If you're going to be in a body for a full lifetime, you might as well do something with that time, right? The only way to do something with that time is to expose the body/mind to dualities. Wherever there are dualities there is good and bad. For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. But life is a lot less serious when you are viewing it from the non-dual context. It's like a dream, sometimes good, sometimes bad, sometimes pleasurable, and sometimes it can temporarily scare the living shit out of you... but you don't take it seriously either way when you know it's a dream.

"fiidano"," 

Hello everyone, I can’t help but constantly mull over who I am in my mind-the constant desire to discover my authentic self consumes me to the point that I feel completely foreign to myself, as if my true identity is blurred, a phantom. I’ve always clinged to the INFP label because it felt like home to me, it felt that it carried the essence of my soul. Beneath the clouds of doubt and pain and self-hatred, I felt that it deeply encapsulated who I was. But after reflecting over the past few years, I think I’ve begun to slowly embrace the realization that I might not be an INFP, and it’s painful, because I buried so much of myself into that label, to an almost unhealthy extent. But there are aspects of myself that are antithetical to INFPs. I care so deeply, to an intoxicating extent, of what others think of me. It’s dreadful and stupid and shallow and I wish that I wasn’t so superficial, but I can’t veil the truth from my self any longer. The central theme of my life boils down to my shallowness. In middle school, I had a dark and disgusting heart. I didn’t place myself in others’ shoes, I was clouded by a hollowness, an emptiness, I despised the world and I was so villainous. I succumbed to malicious gossip for the sake of fitting in. I failed to open my heart to others that so desperately needed love, who felt lost like I did and I refused to be a light in their life. I was so mind-numbingly vain-when I flip through the pages of my old journals, it feels so surreal, a painful dread when I realize how awful I was. I vowed to myself to seek to become a better person, to follow my heart, to love others deeply and wildly. I vowed to myself to seek to make the world a more beautiful place. I vowed to myself to embrace my genuine self with I trampling under evil again. But here I am, raw and exposed and undeniably shallow. My brother pointed out that I’m obsessed with name brands. At first, I felt so attacked, so awed. My entire life, I’ve felt deeply connected to my individuality-I wanted to stay true to my authentic self, refusing to act fake and to people please to fit in. I always felt that I was in-tune with my true self without caring about others’ opinions. But as time unravels, the brighter the truth dawns. I am so obsessed with names, shallow labels. I am currently a high school student and attempting to discern which path I should take, which university I should go to. I felt magnetically attracted to the more prestigious schools, ones with rich academic worlds. I wanted to challenge myself, push myself to reach my own heights. I didn’t care about feeling superior to others, but I cared deeply about pushing my boundaries. Now, over time, I realized that I neglected beautiful schools, ones often underlooked and more homely, but more comforting and authentic. I was blinded by names, by my own shallow ambition. I just wish I wasn’t so innately shallow, but I can’t escape from the truth any longer. I want to believe that I am good, to the very depths of my being, but I am simply a rat lost in the maze of a convoluted and toxic system, greedy and simpleminded and weak and lost. I wish I could escape from my darkness, my vanity, but I can’t, it’s inescapable. I’ve tried, so much, to believe that I am truly authentic, but my brother is right, at the heart of who I am, I’m just a shallow, soulless being. I’ve skimmed through every MBTI type eternally, and who I am still lies an enigma-perhaps I don’t have an identity at all, but

I feel that the truth has illuminated brighter than ever: I’m not an INFP. Maybe deep in my heart I will always cocoon INFP as my identity, maybe I have forged a connection to that label that I can never truly release, but I don’t know how long I can lie to myself. An INFP would not be as obsessed with the outer world, with trivial matters. An INFP would be so much more imaginative than me-I haven’t daydreamed in days, I can’t even daydream no matter how long I want to. I can’t imagine beautiful images and escape from the world (now I realize how shallow I am from the way that I phrased that-I’m obsessed with “beautiful images” rather than depth). I felt that I was poetic, thoughtful, and compassionate, but reflecting over the shallow, lifeless days of my existence I realize how mind-numbingly superficial I was. Even though I wrote abstract poetry, I took everything so paper-thin, so literally. I was obsessed with such substance-less nothingness. I don’t know who I am, but at the heart of myself I’m an empty vase, a kettle who believed herself to be shiny and brilliant and beautiful but I’ve never been filled with water. Even as I write now, I feel artificial, blinded, as if I’m trapped by an illusion. Please help me discover who I am, because I can’t escape from the desire to find myself. I need to know who I am, and I feel that even though I might never be satisfied with the truth, I can’t veil myself any longer.",1582419984,"i felt that i was poetic, thoughtful, and compassionate, but reflecting over the shallow, lifeless days of my existence i realize how mind-numbingly superficial i was.","thoughtful, and compassionate","compassionate",NA,TRUE,"thoughtful , and compassionate","thoughtful",NA,NA,0

"fi9johp","As someone who has tried their entire life to be a good person (and has depression), I want to give somewhat of a hopeful message that ... while it might not ""Change"" your mind?... It might give one bit of optimism to it.

You're mostly right, life can be shitty for kind people. There's a line of individuals waiting to exploit your better nature (which is why I try to help all my kind-hearted friends to learn to enforce their own boundaries, something that's helped me immensely).

But.

There is a group of people, who are both kind/compassionate, but also aware and have shit figured out. These are the absolute best kind of friends. You will only maintain friendships with these people if you're a good person yourself. (You also want to *be* this kind of person)

The one ""reward"" as it were, which is less a reward, but more of a ... Consequence? Of being good... Is that certain people who you genuinely want to be around and have in your life WILL eventually recognize it.

People who exploit other people's good nature but are harmful towards them do not have fulfilling sincere relationships. In fact, as far as there are ""good people"" and ""bad people"" (a concept I don't really agree with at its core but let's run with it)... I consistently see toxic harmful people end up alone and unhappy eventually. Not because of karmic justice, but because almost all people who are consistently 'bad' sabotage every relationship they ever have.

Being kind, compassionate, and empathic rewarded me with really only two things. The knowledge that I did good in the world, and the ability to form connections way stronger than I was ever able to before.

Being compassionate, loving, communicative and kind (ya know, the 'good person' things) brings people into your life who share those qualities, and keeps them there. The trick is to temper that with asserting your own boundaries and recognizing when people aren't healthy for you.

Being a dick to people will eventually make someone miserable. A lot of people like this also are really really good at hiding it, and they take it out on others.

"fi8t8my","Sure, people on both sides can be logical and compassionate, but why should their opinions matter when I’m the one dying?

I will not have the legal right to any form of euthanasia anytime in foreseeable future in my country, but if I live long enough to see it, I’m taking it.

I understand the reasoning of people who are against it. If they don’t want to be euthanized, they shouldn’t be, but there’s no reason I should have to live in pain just so Shelby in North Dakota can feel good about it. 

The policy debate over euthanasia feels unsolvable because *it shouldn’t be a policy debate*. It’s an entirely personal decision. I don’t care if Adam in Wyoming doesn’t like it. It’s none of his business.

The first argument you list, for example, is based on the principle that there’s hope left. The patient has some chance of recovery, no matter how slim. Why the fuck does anyone other than the patient get to decide whether that’s a risk worth taking?!

I shouldn’t have to endure suffering indefinitely just because someone else insists there’s hope. Can you imagine telling a man losing his arm to gangrene that you won’t amputate and they have to let it spread because there’s still hope of saving the limb if there’s a sudden medical breakthrough? How about telling a pregnant woman that she can’t abort a baby that will come out severely deformed an unable to live any kind of life because scientists could find a cure any second now? 

Yes, they’re all perfectly rational... and equally irrelevant. They’re all based on the premise that your personal risk tolerance and your personal opinions on a situation you have never experienced should be legally enforced on others. These people are not hurting anyone. All they’re doing is sparing themselves from suffering.

Thank you. I've enjoyed our debate as well.

&gt; It is not a popular idea amongst lefties but Capitalism is actually quite natural; it mimics the Darwinian dynamic in that it rewards dominance, adaptivity and innovation which allows the strongest and most intelligent actors to rise to the top through competition.

It's so natural it didn't exist for most of human history. That's...a take, I guess.

In reality top-down government control is far more ""natural"" than freedom through capitalism. Most of human history involved powerful tribal leaders controlling others through fear, manipulation, and hierarchy. Capitalism is the first system that truly allows those at the bottom to *rise* through their merits.

&gt;However, the Darwinian dynamic (i.e. survival of the fittest) has some painful requisites, those who succeed must make others suffer for their success in order to refine the quality of the stock.

This is a weird way of looking at capitalism. Yes, Amazon beat out competitors, and so the ones that went out of business ""suffered."" But Amazon is better for the *consumer*, and those who ""lost"" were able to go somewhere else. More importantly, quality of life for **everyone** went up in the process.

I mean, you can keep ignoring the fact that quality of life, life expectancy, and material wealth has increased dramatically for the entire world. But the facts don't disappear because you want them to.

&gt; This process brings with it an enormous quantity of suffering and cruelty, all winners must have losers (See, Hegel's Master Slave Dialectic).

Socialism doesn't solve this. There is no world that lacks winners and losers. Humans are not equal. I will never be as good as Lebron James at basketball, for instance. Not only am I 5'8"" without his athletic ability I've never practiced or dedicated myself to the sport at his level.

So what? Should I be considered the same way as Lebron James? Should he be required to split his wealth with me? If so, why? What are my contributions compared to his? Lebron James has made *thousands* of people rich, and brought joy to millions. I've done none of those things.

But to the socialist, this is somehow an inequality that needs to be rectified. How is that not simply jealousy?

&gt;Now the winners will say this is just the way things have to be and that it's fine and natural and all that (See, Jordan Peterson's justifications for capitalism for instance), but if you have ever not been one of the winners (spoiler, that's most of us) then you know the suffering implicit in it.

No, I don't. Losing is how we grow as people, how we develop, how we learn to win. I *love* losing because it teaches me how to become stronger and better than I was before. It's why humans seek out challenges in the first place.

I spent ten years in the Marine Corps. Hearing people talk about setbacks as if that's ""suffering"" is a demonstration to me just how little actual suffering modern humans have to undergo.

&gt;The opportunity we have as intelligent, reflective creatures is to work to be more compassionate and empathic because, if we think about it, when we suffer we would give anything to have it alleviated.

Compassion and empathy don't solve problems and they don't make life better. If you called up a plumber about a leaky pipe and the plumber told you he felt really bad about your pipe this doesn't make the leak go away. Competence, action, and reason are what fix problems. And these are the traits you look for in a plumber.

So no, I don't agree that compassion alleviates suffering. Solving problems alleviates suffering. I'd rather have a doctor that's an inconsiderate asshole, but competent, than a doctor that's very compassionate but isn't able to help my medical condition.

&gt;Capitalism is the manifestation of these more fundamental Darwinian instincts but it is cruel, exploitative and causes great suffering for many and encourages us to maintain and increase our myopic and self-centred behaviour for our own benefit.

You keep repeating this but it doesn't make it *true*. You mentioned one company (that was censured) as an example but never addressed the entire **nations** of true pain and suffering I presented.

Capitalism is the only place where freedom exists. It's where freedom in government was *born*. It's not a coincidence that major socialist economies end up with dictators. It's a feature, not a bug.

&gt;I hope you find the compassion to break free from these chains because none of us are special, we are all expendable, and when you get thrown under the Darwinian bus, you will wish you had been kinder as others like you look on and deny you that same kindness.

This is a purely emotional appeal, which makes sense to me, because the argument for socialism is *heavily* based on emotion. It ""feels"" good. To quote Thomas Sowell:

""The strongest argument for socialism is that it sounds good. The strongest argument against socialism is that it doesn't work. But those who live by words will always have a soft spot in their hearts for socialism because it sounds so good.""",1582123030,"hearing people talk about setbacks as if that's ""suffering"" is a demonstration to me just how little actual suffering modern humans have to undergo.  &gt;the opportunity we have as intelligent, reflective creatures is to work to be more compassionate and empathic because, if we think about it, when we suffer we would give anything to have it alleviated.","compassionate and empathic","compassionate",NA,FALSE,"more compassionate and empathic","empathic","more",NA,1

"fhlm128","It's hard to believe I do what I do sometimes. I can understand why others use words like crazy and psychotic to invalidate me. They also think I'm egotistical and sacreligeous because I say I can deny gods, as in say no to them and sometimes have to explain to them how what they're doing isn't going to get what they want and how to go about it, but in my experience, they respect people who stand up to them and thier will and they want to work with us, but most people lack the ability to interact with them as in two way communication. Part of what I went through was learning to own my power and who I am as an individual. I understand that my path isn't everyone else's, it is one much less travelled and it is easy to fall into this idea that if the majority of people don't experience it, it must not be real. Ultimately what I learnt was a lot of things are subjective, there is multiple ways to view the same things and truth is somewhere in the middle. Most people cannot percieve things from another person's perspective but I can so it's easy to lose my own truth. I have to do a lot of psychic hygiene and shadow work to own who I am and be true to myself. By following my true will I find myself more and more every day, I become stronger and grow as a person. Being true to myself has made me more kind and compassionate but also more sure of myself and willing to stand up for what I believe in. By admitting I am fallible, I remain balanced and if I make a mistake, I own it and learn from it. I don't let people railroad me anymore, I don't let people project their crap onto me anymore all because I know who I am.

In a nut shell, I understand the bias of others to understand the meaning behind their words and accept that spiritual phenomenon can also be seen as madness and invalidated by others so I only speak about it if I'm sure.

I'm no expert, but I believe the original Arabic word for that, kufr, has a more multifaceted meaning. It is someone who hides the truth, who separates from God, and Hamza Yusuf talks about how the word also can mean, ""ingrate.""

God (IMHO) is not just compassionate, but compassion itself, not just merciful, but mercy itself. God is a force of life, compassion and mercy (which is why the Quran repeatedly tells us that God is the most compassionate and merciful). And those who turn away from goodness itself aren't necessarily atheists, they're something far worse, they're nihilists. 

Nihilism is the most dangerous philosophy. The Columbine shooters (if you read their writings) had become very nihilistic before they did what they did. Governments that try to erase God become very dangerous. The Communists killed more people than any government has ever killed ever (100 million people). Nihilism is the gateway to Hell, and a prevalent problem of our age. 

I think many Atheists (what we consider atheists today) still believe in goodness and compassion and mercy, they simply don't think that religion has the monopoly on those things, and that there is no anthropomorphization of those concepts into a deity.

I say this as someone who in my teenage years into the first couple years of my adult life also struggled with depression. I can't say I ever fell down the hole of drugs but I know how far that hole can go. The best things you can do for yourself to help determine where you should fall politically is to do your best to formulate your own opinions and thoughts on what the role of government is, what is right and wrong, and what do you need to get better.

So as someone who still identifies as a libertarian (small L as the Libertarian party simply does not speak to me all that well) I find that to me the role of government is to provide non competitive/non exclusionary (in the economic sense) goods and services which protect individuals' liberties/rights. That is their sole job. What is right and wrong is a much larger question and better to address particular issues than this as a whole here. As for what I need to do to get better, well I need to still work on myself, I need to get my exercise up, I need to do better for my family, I need to take better responsibility when I do fail and ensure my failures are things I learn from. These answers may be the same for you or they may be different but you should find things you can give as answers for each one of these and it might not be something that comes easily.

In general I have found members of this community rather supportive and helpful, encouraging and resourceful wanting to help people better themselves and beat their depression.

Yes depression needs to be addressed. Every individual who is depressed should and must face it themselves with the support network of either friends, family, or in some cases just trained professionals.

&gt;And if so, what are the plans that the GOP has to address such issues?

I wouldn't want the GOP to address this issue any more than I would want a big government organization coming in and saying they want to take conservator ship of your house because you let the grass grow too long in the back. Is it something that is wrong? Yes. Is it something that you as the owner should deal with? Yes in both the grass situation and the mental health one.

You might research a bit about the Autism spectrum and see if you can find good tips there or if the symptoms you observe might indicate a different cause to his issues. Or he could just be an extremely awkward guy.

You have a really good opportunity here to change the course of this young guy’s life and to help him make some really positive changes. At the same time, you have the opportunity to hurt him and have him keep falling into the same behaviors and traps that he’s falling into now. If you’re able to do just a little extra to help him and to help everyone who is going to interact with him in the future, then what you tell him could drastically change his life for the better.

With some extra knowledge under your belt, I would suggest the following:

If you’re comfortable talking with him, you can talk with him. If not, write him a compassionate but direct letter that he can take back to his support system and get feedback on. If his parents are good, they’ll help him make the changes. If not, then they could flip out. Thus why you want to make it compassionate.

The key is that you want to communicate with him in ways that are direct and set good boundaries that he can test against (think of the scientific method from science class).

Second, gather your support system. Ideally yours first and if you can, then gather his and get advice from everyone. Gathering everyone and getting everybody on the same page, understanding that you’re trying to help him and give him good advice so he can improve is your goal.

If you know his family at all and can get in touch with his parents, you can see if they’re the kind of people that are compassionate and are just struggling to raise him a bit, or if they’re the crazy, neglectful kind that might take any kind of perceived criticism about their baby as an attack on him and go nuts.

If they’re the first 

You can tell him that
- you can see that he’s into you, but you are not ready to date anyone right now
- you want to give him some tips to help him get dates in the future
   + girls are attracted to guys who like to be clean. You even heard some guys take showers once per day or every other day
   + girls appreciate compliments about their virtues (google the virtues project) or their appearance, but feel scared when someone other than their parents tells them they know the car they drive every day
  + girls appreciate having their own space. In school, they like to focus on their school work and in between classes, they’re trying to focus on getting to class instead of having company. Giving people space to get where they need to go means that they’re happier to spend time with you when it’s time to socialize
 + girls also appreciate someone who can listen more than they talk. Part of being a good friend is knowing what the other person is doing in their life and asking them only one or two questions a day about it.

You don’t want to give him too many things, but definitely hit on the things you feel like he needs to change the most. 

Lastly, if you’re up for it - become his friend and wingman, you can give him the inside scoop on girls. Really try to change your mindset about him and think of him as your little brother or as your mentee/student. 

You have to work to always make sure you’re compassionate with him, but take him under your wing and teach him long term. There are lots of great news stories and YouTube videos about football teams, cheerleading squads, and student bodies who chose to embrace the Down’s syndrome/autistic/weird kids in their school instead of ostracizing them. They’re beautiful examples of the absolute best that humanity is capable of.

School is really hard for everyone. He’s a kid who is trying really hard to play a game where he doesn’t understand half the rules and may or may not be capable of understanding them, but you have an opportunity to help him learn at least the fundamentals. He also just wants to be loved, like you do, and he doesn’t know how to get others to love him as easily as other kids do. You might not be the person to love him, but you can be an ally and friend to him and at the bare minimum, give him the benefit of the doubt like you already have been.

You’re a great person, thank you for asking such a great question and wanting to help him.",1580569472,"if not, write him a compassionate but direct letter that he can take back to his support system and get feedback on.","compassionate but direct","compassionate","but",FALSE,"compassionate but direct","direct",NA,NA,1
"fg5w9w9","This is a really good question, and I think instead of thinking of ""character traits"", consider behaviours and learned skills. Not everyone is going to nail it 100%. But they're good goals and guidelines. 

* Self-care and help-seeking behaviours: does this person attend a doctor, dentist, optometrist, psychologist or other healthcare professional when something doesn't seem right? Do they clean their teeth thoroughly twice a day, groom facial/body hair regularly, get adequate sleep and water, avoid drugs/tobacco consumption, and have a healthy relationship with alcohol? Are they comfortable disclosing potentially embarrassing information about their body or sexual conduct to a doctor to ensure that they are safeguarding their sexual health? Do they regularly use contraception and disease prophylaxis? 
* Emotional regulation and literacy: can this person process and understand their emotions in a healthy way that doesn't require codependency on others, substance abuse, or violent outbursts? Do they have insight into how and why they feel the way they do? Do they ensure that when they are experiencing an extreme negative emotion that this is done without harm or disruption to others? Do they show vulnerability by letting appropriately close people know what is going on in their life, but not overburdening them with upsetting information that a counsellor would be able to handle better? It's a really fine line. 
* Assertiveness: does this person respect their own boundaries and abilities? Are they able to say no without apology or guilt? Do they respect the boundaries of others, or when another person has said no to them, with grace? Are they able to advocate their needs or wants in a compassionate but clear way? Do they avoid excessive or premature self-disclosure?
* Integrity: is there coherence between what they say and what they mean? Do they speak without ambiguity and avoid ""wriggle-room"" to snake their way out of a commitment or self-indemnification? Are their words and actions in alignment with their stated values? 
* Relationship nurturance: do they initiate conversation with others? Do they take responsibility for planning events, celebrating other peoples' milestones, or caring for a loved one in some capacity? Do they have a broad network of people from different walks of life and contexts? Are they willing to do things that they might find silly or very mildly uncomfortable (e.g. buying flowers, wearing a particular outfit) because it makes a loved one feel special?
* Active listening and empathy: are they able to listen and actively show that they understand the speaker's intent and feeling? Can they listen without interrupting, interjecting with value judgements, or giving unwanted advice? Do they listen as much as they speak? 
* Humour: are they able to find the humour in everyday events? Are they able to use humorous devices like exaggeration, or reversal, or puns in conversation without becoming domineering or attention seeking? Does their humour seek to uplift or point out harmless ridiculousness (or significant political issues)? Do they avoid being unnecessarily self-deprecating or overly negative? Do they target others for factors they cannot change? Do they make fun of traits or identities that are marginalised, at a disadvantage or in the minority? 
* Fullness of life: can this person keep themselves happy and engaged? Do they have a broad enough group of friends to maintain contact with? Are their hobbies active, or with a good balance of individual and social activities? Are they employed in a position that uses their skills and interests? Have they considered a spiritual or philosophical dimension of life and pursue this?",1580541552,"are they able to advocate their needs or wants in a compassionate but clear way?","compassionate but clear","compassionate","but",FALSE,"compassionate but clear","clear",NA,NA,1

My first piece of advice to you is to keep focusing on self improvement, focus on learning about other people and what they go through so that you don't fall into any other ideology. Focus on being more empathetic and compassionate, but always put your own mental and physical health first. Always.

Secondly, don't actively pursue a relationship until you really feel like you can make it work, don't worry about your age or experience, just focus on what's good for you. Let it play out naturally.

Finally, never underestimate the importance of masturbation.

I feel like it's the only way I can figure out what I think about something - to  say it out loud and see if it feels right. I can't do that around my partner. He's super smart and compassionate, but he never met a half-formed thought he could resist jumping on and tearing apart :) I feel like there's no one I can ramble to. I don't feel safe exploring 'real time' with him. 

I also talk to my cats, the neighbor's dog when I walk her, I narrate what I'm doing, I put on loud music and dance while doing the dishes and cleaning up the kitchen while my husband and son play video games together. I will, no joke, dance so much I have to stop after a while 'cause I'm getting tired. It's therapeutic, but sometimes it makes me sad that I can't share it.

"ff2i9kd","I think what I’m going to say may sound harsh or a bit cold, but I still think it’s a valid point of view, and genuinely think it’s worth thinking about. 

Ending your relationship with her would be a bad decision, you’re happy and still love her greatly. What I think would be the most helpful would be for you to stop putting your life on hold hoping that more monogamy or less of your partners/dates are the answer.

You sound mainly disappointed that you confident woman you knew and loved isn’t who you’re currently dating, but how that’s impacted a lot of the things that would have brought you joy or pleasure. I don’t think of you as selfish, but that sounds a bit like the problem. You’ve been supportive and considerate and patient, but those efforts and that labor hasn’t seemed to make much major progress.

I don’t see how it’d be beneficial for you to deny yourself possible joys or pleasure with others, just to put in a ton of emotional labor that doesn’t seem to result in real improvement on how she feels. While I think leaving her is something you’d regret, deny yourself your joy rn sounds like captaining a sinking ship.

You living your life again could possibly help spur a part of her that wasn’t accessible earlier. That maybe you being compassionate, but unapologetic about dating and playing with others again can help her (and you) not prioritize her insecure feelings over the overall health and joy of y’all’s relationship.

"fepqsko","&gt;College rivals works as well now just as well as it did then.

Does it? Did it even work then? I just have a hard time buying a genius dictator and master of magic so obsessed with someone over a simple college rivalry. Starting Reed as a friend who then turns against him would make their rivalry something much deeper  and personal.

&gt;The tragedy of Doom is not what happens to him in collage and after but what happens to him before that.

I'm just gonna say that I completely agree here. Doom's experience at college is a very small part of what made him who he is. It is still an important part of establishing him as a Fantastic Four villain. (And a Reed Richards villain, specifically, as you pointed out.)

&gt;His amazing intellect set's him apart from everyone. He can't relate to his pears and the state hates him.

This seems to me like a good reason he and Reed *would* become friends. Both are set apart from others by their intelligence, and it would make sense for them to naturally gravitate towards each other.

&gt;He is alone and due to the trust issues can't reach out or accept anyone reaching out.

Okay, but what if he does? Colleges like to assign group projects. Perhaps they start off not liking each other, but forced to work together, they slowly begin to bond. Victor reluctantly lets down his walls for Reed... What then happens when Victor, who refuses to let anyone in past his barriers, allows Reed in, only for Reed to betray him? I don't know about you, but that sounds like a really compelling reason for someone who had been teetering on the edge to get that final push to outright villainy.

&gt;Reed isn't anti-social he's the embodiment of the absent minded professor. He's so enamored by the mysteries of the universe, sometimes he forgets all else. It's been shown time and again that when not involved in research he is a deeply caring and empathetic person.

I feel like I should clarify a bit about my direction with Reed. When I say anti-social, I don't mean to suggest he has Anti-Social Personality Disorder, or is a psychopath. Only that he can sometimes have difficulty forming connections with people. He can still be a caring person, but have difficulty knowing how to express those feelings properly.

&gt;These men are polar opposites.

They're two arrogant geniuses who are always convinced they're right. Yes, Doom is a narcissist who has long since abandoned any moral compass, and Reed is more caring and compassionate... But the reason their rivalry has worked so well in the comics for several decades now is because Victor is essentially a dark mirror of Reed.

For what it's worth, I understand your objections, and that any change from the canon can be worrisome, but I personally think this direction would make for make for a compelling modern take on the story for the MCU.

&gt;No, my friend, Doom gets his own origin movie in between the second and third FF movie (maybe a show on Disney+) and it covers his tragic past. In the first two he's just a shadowy presence. The third movie is the pay off for Doom and the FF.

Wait...

"fems6qc","Weighing in from Los Angeles, 

There is a huge problem with homelessness and drug addiction here. Some call it a housing crisis, which is true, I read recently that the affordable housing crisis has gotten so bad here that  California needs to build 3.5 million housing units by 2025 — more than three times the current pace — to address its shortage and regain any semblance of affordability. It is undeniably true that many hard working people cannot afford the cost of living despite doing all the right things.

But a lot of people are hitting the nail on the head and call it a drug/mental health crisis, which is also VERY true. Californians in general pride themselves on being liberal minded and compassionate. But if you spend some time in Los Angeles, you can see where the compassion is warped. Prop 47  downgraded a variety of ""non-serious, nonviolent"" crimes that had previously been considered felonies to misdemeanors such as shoplifting, grand theft, receiving stolen property, forgery, fraud, and writing bad checks. So when AB 109 passed, reducing prison population (the empathic thing to do) for people who weren't considered a threat to the public, releasing people with known substance abuse issue without ensuring the proper treatment, we get what is happening in Los Angeles. Rampant, open drug use, petty theft, and hostile addicts are the norm here; alot of the streets are absolutely filthy and a hazard to public health, numerous cases of violent assault. All compounded by corrupt politicians who refuse to address that this is a DRUG/MENTAL health crisis that is intertwined with the lack of jobs and affordable housing. 

I'm not advocating for throwing anyone in prison and tossing the key. But there should be mandatory rehabilitation for people with substance abuse issues and even more social programs for helping people get back and stay on their feet. 

The collective lack of empathy is absolutely feuling the drug crisis.  We don't bat an eye anymore.",1579268088,"californians in general pride themselves on being liberal minded and compassionate.","minded and compassionate","compassionate",NA,FALSE,"minded and compassionate","minded",NA,NA,0

"fekwmie","&gt;well he straight up said that he hated Rose because she wasn't 'good enough' for the Doctor, insulted her looks and her being so 'common', said he would have killed her off and that she wasnt good looking enough to be with the Doctor

Did Moffat really say these things? Supremely fucked up if so.  Source please.

-

&gt;then made River- a character who's entire life is literally surrounded in the Doctor. He's there when she's born, her entire life literally REVOLVES around him from birth to death. That is creepy.

I see why you think it creepy Moffat would pen such an ark,  but at the same time can see his artistic reasoning for doing _this_.  I certainly would find it BEYOND CREEPY if the doctor groomed a newborn to be his future lover.  That is not how the causality occured for him.  I think anyone finding themselves present in another time with an infant version of their known future beloved would stay involved with the situation treating it like a child in their family only even more important, and there is nothing creepy about that at all.

&gt;She's a stereotypical 'powerful woman but only in a way men like' where her entire personality is sexy oneliners, her lover, being 'powerful' but also oh shes a woman so she has to wear sexy dresses and high heels. It was empowering in the 80s, but it's very clearly misogynist-

You're right.  And yet these archetypes are reflected among actual female populations.  I totally understand your rebellion against these gender ascriptions, but let's not be foolish and act like the entire female population presently disassociates with these concepts - let alone finds them offensive.  Let's also not ignore the fact that there are plenty of girls too who find this archetype sexy and attractive.

&gt;it's making a woman powerful while still putting her down to her looks.

Can a woman not be depicted as strong _and_ beautiful without it being interpreted as fleshy objectification and the discardance of the persons soul and character??

&gt;Rose is more of a powerful feminist character than River ever has been. Rose is kind, caring and compassionate- but holds her own just as many times as shes saved. She's fierce and strong while caring for others. She's a common girl who lived on a low income estate, she's imperfect, she's human in a way River is not. She's never sexualized (saved for Cassandra sexualizing her) and she'd be the same if she was a dude. That's a powerful woman character, and having such an amazingly written woman replaced by a 'sexy powerhouse' feels very demeaning.

I agree entirely about Rose, and lets not forget my favorite: Donna.  But this is what I am saying.  We have had a full spectrum of female companions in just the nuwho.  Bill Potts, Rose, Donna, River, Amy.  And river is the only one sexualized _at all_.  John Barrowman is sexy and strong and Jack's relationship with DT was handdds on.  Yet noone would claim this means that all men or all gay/bi men are charasmatic dominant nutters like Jack.

&gt;Not to mention his season 1 episodes morals are 'A (subtextually stated) raped teenaged girl needs to accept her motherhood or else everyone dies', and how he made jokes about The Doctor sexually assaulting her, its clear he has no respect for women.

When he is in detriment he can be emotionally manipulative, taking advantage of other people's feelings. He can imagine his feelings more potent than they really are and when put to the test they can float away as fast as they came. Especially with this much air in the spread he has no staying power, no stability, nothing to ground him.

"fe64k4r","I reposted an unsent letter to my crush last week that I made four months ago because I finally got over her last month and started liking someone else.  Despite being over her, though, I still like her very much and look up to her as a friend of mine as she is someone I have known for 11 years now, and I still deeply care for her, so I thought posting my letter for her again here from the past would truly allow me to release emotions.

Dear Friend,

It's been nearly six months since we last spoke, but I hope you've been well and that you're really enjoying university.

I've known you since I was six, and for the almost ten years I've known you,  you've always been an incredible role model.  I'm amazed by your kindness, altruism, eccentricity, uniqueness, and peacefulness. You always liked to tease me for being taller than you because I'm younger, because you want me to be able to look up to you, but I want you to know that you don't need to be taller because I already look up to you.   I know that I'm not the best person, and I need to do a lot more to be  more kind and compassionate, but if I could ever even get close to being   half the amazing person you are, then I would be one of the luckiest people alive.

I know that we're basically opposites other than the fact that we're both introverted.  I know that we don't talk too often even though we spend a lot of time together, but I love how we can communicate without words.  I love how you motivate other people to be happier even without really saying that  much. I love how you're so passionate about Math, and you want to spread it so that people have the chance to love what you love by becoming a Math teacher.

I want you to know that even though I've known you for so long and that my crush for you has ended and I now like someone else, I miss you like crazy every day.   You're one of the first things that pops into my head when I wake up  and one of the last as I fall asleep, and I am mesmerized at the fact  that even with over 7.7 billion people in this world, I somehow met you against all the odds, got a chance to spend so much time with you, and even ended up developing feelings for you.

I  thought as a little kid that love meant that people would hug, kiss,   and hold hands, especially in public.  I was worried my parents didn't love each other because they weren't too affectionate with each other.  As I got older, I completely started to disagree with this logic, and I cannot understand anymore how I thought this way.  In fact, I feel awful and guilty that I did because my parents did love each other all along, and they do in many ways, I think, that I sometimes myself cannot express in words.  They just expressed it in ways differently from the way many others did, and there's nothing wrong with that.  Thanks to you, I realized that love is more than that and extremely hard to explain it with words.  It likely one of those undefinable words in the English language.  It's when your heart is growing so big that it bursts  into pieces and makes do with that to be an even bigger heart.  It's when your mind is actually the heart because the heart just beats and the mind is where you feel.  It's when you know for certain that the ones you love will be okay.  It's when you know that even if the next  time we see each other is ten, twenty, thirty, infinite years later, or even in dreams, that I will meet you again.   It's when you know, most of all, that every goodbye isn't a goodbye, because it's another chance to say hello.  Love is whatever we want it to be, and I want it to be this.  I want it to be this authentic experience in which I'm literally opening up myself for you to take pieces of and destroy, and I am glad you took parts of my heart along the way.

So  I just want to say goodbye and hi.  Goodbye, and hello because I will wave back to you always as if it is the first and millionth time that I did.

Have a nice day.

Your friend forever,

"fdomx1d","I went through something similar with my wife, when she was at a terrible job with a terrible boss which either contributed to or coincidentally occurred at the same time as severe postpartum depression and anxiety.

I found it very difficult to watch my wife endure treatment that she did not deserve, and that I would not personally tolerate. I found it frustrating that she continuously rejected my advice and pleas to take any positive action. I found it frustrating to have any and all offers of help denied. 

And I found it difficult to continue to console her when it seemed there were so many solutions within her grasp that she would not take. As a partner I felt like a failure watching her spiral and suffer. And that evolved into anger and resentment at being put in this position and being made to feel this way for so long.

I did my best to remain patient and compassionate, but it was difficult and I failed at times. 

I think it's very possible that your boyfriend is feeling a lot of feelings that he is not controlling well (sad and sympathetic toward you, angry for you at your boss/job, angry at you for refusing help and prolonging this issue, angry at himself for feeling angry with you and disappointed in himself for not being able to rise above all of this and be the person you need him to be right now) and rather than exploding or otherwise making things worse, he's bottling it all up and trying (in a completely ineffective and internally damaging way) to not make this awful experience worse for you.

Obviously this is just my personal experience, and I'm not holding it up as a shining example of how either of us handled these difficulties. I don't know you or your BF, and his experience may be completely different than mine. But maybe sharing my feelings will be helpful. Ultimately she reached a breaking point and we were able to find common purpose and together worked to sort out her career and our relationship.

"fdn7w6i","I would be a little wary of saying something like: ""I also believe that eternal torment violates the character of God."" That's making the assumption you understand enough of what God's righteousness is to know that decision would be categorically ungodly and I'm inclined to think you aren't (or consider yourself) knowledgeable enough to state it definitively.

As for your argument, assuming eternal torment doesn't reflect God's compassion and love ignores a couple of things. First of all, **this** is the era in which God decided to demonstrate His love and compassion. Unless I'm missing something (feel free to correct me if I am) I don't remember any situation that would suggest there will be anyone receiving any mercy or compassion on or after Judgement Day.

In addition to that, God's character is made up of a lot more than ""love and compassion"". I believe you forget he is also an **avenger**. He is abundantly merciful and compassionate but when He decides it's time to avenge He doesn't pull any punches.

&gt;If we deliberately keep on sinning after we have received the knowledge of the truth, no sacrifice for sins is left, but only a fearful expectation of judgment and of raging fire that will consume the enemies of God. Anyone who rejected the law of Moses died without mercy on the testimony of two or three witnesses. How much more severely do you think someone deserves to be punished who has trampled the Son of God underfoot, who has treated as an unholy thing the blood of the covenant that sanctified them, and who has insulted the Spirit of grace? For we know him who said, “It is mine to avenge; I will repay,” and again, “The Lord will judge his people.”It is a dreadful thing to fall into the hands of the living God. (Hebrews 10:26-31)

So absolutely, God is a just God who will not find the innocent guilty or the guilty innocent. But once the guilty has been found guilty, vengeance is what the Bible states they will receive.

Title: **Apt Mate's Ill Father Moves In**

Original Post: 

&gt; I currently live in a 2B2B apartment w a girl that I met through the online university housing page. We are both graduate students. It's been 4 months of living together. Two months ago, she came home w tears in her eyes. I asked if everything was okay.. She divulged that her father was just diagnosed w stage 4 cancer and wo a permanent home. Two weeks ago, she sent me a text asking if it would be okay if her father stayed in her room w her until our lease ends (in another 8 months) so that she could care for him. Sympathizing for her, I said sure.. I was still on holiday at the time of receiving that text. That was the last and only of that ""conversation"". Within a day of returning to university from break, her father moved all his belongings in.
&gt; 
&gt; She never offered to pay more in rent, utilities, or expenses. Since I am living on 100% student loans, I asked her to pay a little more for utilities since there would be an additional individual sharing the costs now, but did not mention anything about reconfiguring the rental terms for ""adding a 3rd tenant"". She said okay.
&gt; 
&gt; At the time of okaying her text message, I did not think much of his move in. However, seeing all his belongings in what used to be a near empty apartment and an old man in our apartment everyday, I am having second thoughts. I have begun asking friends if this is strange. Nearly everyone I spoke to said they'd feel somewhat uncomfortable. 
&gt; 
&gt; My question is, should I feel uneasy about having a complete stranger live w me? Our doors do not lock and I barely know my apartment mate. All I know about the father is his first name. Should i feel okay to ask for my apt mate to pay more for rent knowing that she has a dying father to care for? If so, how should I do so... Or would anyone rather just move out? Trying to be compassionate, but also unsure of how to re-approach this difficult situation. 
&gt; 
&gt; At lost for how I should think and feel. Please share your thoughts!

"fdg2zfw","I absolutely want to give BOTH Jens respect.  They seems like a very good people, they seem compassionate, but they BOTH suffer from the same problems.

&amp;#x200B;

\-  Consistently speaks or asks a question RIGHT after a point from the other host is made.  This is not only incredibly grating, but it completely derails the conversation.  Matt, or Don, or anyone will make a powerful rebuttal to the caller, and rather then allow the caller to respond to the point, Jen IMMEDIATELY jumps in with a NEW question and the caller COMPLETELY sidesteps the original rebuttal to answer Jen's question.  It's incredibly frustrating and kills important conversations.  


\- Seems over-eager.  Similarly, and this is seen especially in the new episode, Jen seems so eager to get a word in she echoes the final word of the other host.  For example, MANY times Matt is trying to finish the point and Jen chimes in at the last second and mimics Matt's last word.  Again, this is just incredibly annoying and doesn't add anything to the conversation.

&amp;#x200B;

\-  Often makes incorrect points or incorrectly characterizes arguments from other hosts and callers.  Again, you can see this happen multiple times in the recent episode.  After Matt makes a point, Jen chimes in with an extra comment and Matt has to correct her because her point is incorrect or unrelated.  Similarly, there are many moments where Jen misrepresents the caller's opinion and time is spent trying to re-correct their point.  It just adds further distraction and confusion.

&amp;#x200B;

\-  Compassion sometimes comes off as overly patronizing.  I don't necessarily fault Jen for this, but she has a tendency to overreact to a callers with ""I'm so proud of you for doing research and trying your best and thinking"" and blah blah blah...  I get it.  It's much better to be compassionate and caring towards callers but I think it's a bit much.  Similarly, I feel like moments of praise happen a little to quickly in the conversation when I feel like there is more information and discussion to dig down into.  

&amp;#x200B;

\- Asks redundant questions instead of digging into arguments.  Again, I don't necessarily fault her for this because these questions are important BUT, many times she asks callers ""Why do you believe this?"" or ""What do you believe"" right after the caller has literally JUST answered the question or shared their belief.  To me, this comes off as just regurgitating questions rather than focusing on the actual content or logical fallacy the caller brings up.  This happens many times in the episode where she hosts with Don... also the episode with Don and Eric.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways... normally I don't care too much and I'm happy to enjoy the FREE content that is provided... BUT, if Jen is going to continue to be a prominent host, these problems need to be addressed.  I'm reaching a point where when I see Jen's named attached to episodes, I immediately feel myself react negatively and I don't want that feeling towards one of my favorite weekly shows. 

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you for listening.

Basically, it was a short-lived series about the life of a spaceship crew just trying to get by in a world controlled on one side by a subtly totalitarian state and a new frontier filled with lawless planets on the other. It was written as a mashup of sci-fi and westerns.

I relate to what you said, I’m also empathetic and compassionate but not so much in an emotional way more so in a humanitarian type of way. I experience emotions, I just think about them and rationalize them rather than feel them deeply. I never open up to someone about my deep emotions, I express my deep emotions creatively by writing poetry rather than talking about them. Also I hate being wrong because I pride myself on my intelligence more than anything else. I’m open minded and am willing to hear others out, and I can take a while to form an opinion on something because I have to gather all the information about something before I form an opinion. But once I do form an opinion on something I’m very stubborn on it and it can be hard to change my mind. I’m very often misunderstood, there’s only 1 person in my life who understands me (or at the very least attempts me), besides them most people dismiss my thoughts, ideas and questions as crazy.

"fcwe4ch","Thanks for your input. I definitely think I tend to react to things instead of think through and then act. I think a good example is with my girlfriend. She is a very caring person and I am too most of the time. She had a rough week and know she was emotionally vulnerable. On top of everything, she came down with a pretty bad cold. I knew this and we talked about it a lot and I helped her feel a lot better. The next day, we were both off of work so we spent the day together. She was already feeling better from her sickness and without thinking I started trying to be sexual with her and she got very upset because she felt like I wasn’t being considerate of her feelings it just really hurt her because everything else she was already dealing with. She is also absolutely right. We had a long discussion and I came to the conclusion that most of the time I and caring and compassionate. But every once in a while my brain shuts off and I just react. Looking back at it, it was a horrible idea to try to be sexual with her because I knew she wouldn’t have wanted to. Of course as soon as she said she didn’t want that I backed off, but I still hurt her. There’s other times that things like this have happened and I’ve just been inconsiderate without really thinking. I am tired of hurting people due to being incapable of putting others feelings ahead of my own.

"fcvq9sx","I can see what you mean here.  One thing I'm always wary of and that I would caution you to heed is the difference between rebuke and condemnation/judgement.  I will never say that someone who doesn't follow EVERY rule of the bible isn't a true Christian, because the truth is that God's Word is the defining guide for our life...but we are not perfect like Him and so it is impossible for us to follow every single commandment.  No matter how you try you will ALWAYS run afoul of something.  Hence why God's grace is sufficient...because if God was not graceful to us then all of us would be too busy suffering in hell to be having this conversation (sorry to get dark there but it's the truth).

So as for me, I will serve the Lord.  I will never use Him to justify anything I do that is sinful.  Let us be frank here, each and every single one of us has a vice or something we struggle with.  God is graceful, loving and compassionate, but he also knows that free will means nothing without the opportunity to choose.  And with choice comes failure.  Even the highest of human success is built on mountains of failure.  I feel God speaking to me when I read this?

1 Corinthians 10:13 KJV There hath no temptation taken you but such as is common to man: but God *is* faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able; but will with the temptation also make a way to escape, that ye may be able to bear *it*.

And we need to trust in God that his grace is sufficient:

Matthew 17:20 KJV And Jesus said unto them, Because of your unbelief: for verily I say unto you, If ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye shall say unto this mountain, Remove hence to yonder place; and it shall remove; and nothing shall be impossible unto you.

So the crux of it lies not with us, but with God who makes the way FOR US.  These things don't give us a license to sin, and do not invalidate any works done according to His will, but rather serves as the meta that gives them meaning (I had that epiphany while learning meta tags in web design in college...you find meaning and inspiration in the strangest places sometimes lol).

Anyways I read your post and felt God trying to say something to me and this is what came to me.  God bless, and Father I just wanted you to speak and not me...I hope I did a good job getting out of your way this time.",1578007668,"god is graceful, loving and compassionate, but he also knows that free will means nothing without the opportunity to choose.","loving and compassionate","compassionate",NA,FALSE,"loving and compassionate","loving",NA,NA,0

"fctzyxx","My dad was an alcoholic who never tried to hide it. I met a man who, before we met, liked to drink alone. That was a red flag for me, but I ignored it because I am not a drinker and figured some people drink alone. As far as I knew once we got together he never drink alone again. He also didn't drink much in front of me knowing how much I hated my father the alcoholic. Sometimes I would find empty beer bottles in the recycling, but I ignored it because some people drink beer. Looking back, I realize that there were a LOT of empty beer bottles. But, he was in charge of recycling so it never really sunk in. AutoZone one would come out missing. He would be sick in the mornings a lot. We'd argue over this weird stuff, and I would ask him, ""What the hell is going on with you?!"" He would lie, and lie, and lie about big things and small and that was the part that really disgusted and upset me.

Then, one day after he was totally melting down over an issue that could've, should've been ordinary, he revealed that he been a closet alcoholic from the day we met, and for every day of the seven years that we were together. He was an alcoholic before we met, but he knew how much I hated alcoholics, so he hid it very, very well. He couldn't hide it anymore, he said.

How did I get ready to leave? I didn't. I left, and THEN I got ready. I was 48.

I slept in a hotel for the first two nights.  I couldn't afford to stay any longer, so I slept in my car for another two nights. That was scary and cold My work has a shower and a locker. Then I couch served among friends for a couple of weeks, and looked on Craigslist for a cheap room to rent. I found a great lady who had a Q of her own, her brother. She was really struggling with his alcoholism. I rented a room in her beautiful house for a couple of months until I could save up enough money to rent a place with my own.

He let me keep my things at his house until I found that place. I hired a moving company to move my stuff out of there.

I only talked to him a few times during those months, and was compassionate but firm. I was sympathetic. As soon as I was in my new place, I allowed the anger and betrayal to settle in and told him to fuck the fuck off.

He started looking for my replacement while I was couch surfing. He found her, and married her three months later.

It's been 3.5 years since I walked out with no plan.  Now, I love my place, I love my peace, I love my freedom from drama. I'm not mad at him, anymore. I have no idea how he is or what he's doing. He may as well be dead, and may he rest in peace.

I have huge trust issues. I don't trust myself not to instinctually pick another alcoholic. I don't trust myself to see the signs. I've gone from too trusting to not trusting at all, and totally gun-shy about dating. I get lonely. But I try to embrace my peace and freedom and make the most of the life that I'm choosing.

"fcte2dv","I was rewatching FT Zero yesterday, and I wondered the same thing.

1. If Law wasn't used, Mavis wouldn't have had the Curse of Contradiction.

2. I think they'd all still be friends, since Yuri would be grateful to Mavis anyway. 

3. Also, with time, when Mavis would grow up, I think she and Yuri would've fallen in love. Even though we all know about MavisXZeref, that scene in the anime in which Mavis stands in front of the lake and looks back at Yuri and Yuri breaks down crying is adorable. Yuri telling Mavis that he would live for Mavis' dream from now on would've been chalked up as a romantic scene had Mavis been older and a character in a shoujo anime. 

4. So no Zeref; therefore no Fairy Heart.

5. No Fairy Heart, so Emperor Spriggan wouldn't try invading Ishgar.

6. No Fairy Heart; meaning that Zeref would keep living on in misery.

Some things that wouldn't change:

1. Fairy Tail's birth.

2. Zeref wouldn't stop pursuing Natsu, or END.

3. FT would have a different master. That master would still be kind and compassionate, but it wouldn't be the Makarov we know and love.

"fcny77f","I can't speak regarding Jess Payne because I've not really kept tabs on her. Regarding Sydney, I think she is a peacemaker, and people with this personality type come across as passive. Sydney is actually vocal with Jess if you look back at past seasons of Eric &amp; Jessie, and Sydney does maintain boundaries. I believe she's truly content with being a wife and mother because that's her dream. But because she has an older sister who has been deemed by the family as wildly successful, she's viewed as a pushover by the majority of individuals who keep up with this family. I really don't think she is. I just think the role she learned to play was the peacemaker.

One guy was a really hard-core gang member who dealt with hallucinations. He had killed people (or at least said he had). There were a few patients who were really disconnected from reality. One guy would just walk in circles for hours and hours. He actually stole my clothes one day. At least two of the women there had been severely abused (one was recovering from being beaten so badly she had broken bones).

The doctors were really professional. Some patients would be violent or would scream or tell. They would just follow procedure and be as calm as they could.

"fcds8xy","I've never commented on this thread before, and this is a little on the dark side, but here goes.

I cannot say enough good things about the Midwives and OB's at Providence OBGYN. With my last pregnancy before this one, I went with Baby and Company. It had been 9 years since I had a baby and I had my first two all naturally and wanted an even more natural experience by having my baby in a birth center. It was amazing, but then they closed this past spring!  We had planned to have one more baby, so I began doing my research again.

Luckily, many of the midwives who were at Baby and Co decided to jump on staff with Providence OBGYN (which was the backup OB for all patients there). They had a great rating, so I figured they would be great. I found out I was pregnant mid September. The staff was great and got me in for an early ultrasound when I had some early spotting.

I had an unremarkable first visit with my favorite midwife, Alex Montgomery. Baby looked great! I'm 36, so I had my first trimester screening ultrasound with Maternal Fetal Medicine (same building) and that looked great too. 10 days later, I had tried to listen to baby on my home doppler, and didn't find her.

If you didn't know this, Novant has (for any Novant OB practice) an OB specific urgent care off Carmel Road. I went there, Nov 21st and after some debate whether they heard the baby on the doppler or not, they got the ultrasound machine and we discovered she had passed maybe a day before.

Clearly, I was devastated. This was my first girl after 3 boys and our last baby. The next day, I went into Providence to plan a procedure because I was too far along. Long story short, they got me in that day and did the procedure. Midwives don't do surgery, so I had an OB for that who was really very sweet and compassionate. But, my midwife Alex showed up. Not only did she show up, but she came into pre-op and gave me a huge hug and let me cry with her. During the surgery, she was even there the whole time and got my daughter's sweet tiny footprint for me.

We were set to go to Aruba only 3 days later. Not great timing at all, but we didn't want to cancel the trip. Alex was amazing and very responsive when I was on the trip and had any questions. I also got Shingles on the trip and she was able to advise me on what to do.

I saw her for my 2 week post op as well and she just hugged me and loved on us and helped us through this time. 3 weeks after my loss, I broke my leg. Not like ""hmm, that sucks"" like ""OMG what did you do?!"" 

I had surgery at Novant the next day and I messaged Alex to tell her what happened. She was on call the next day and she stopped by my room to talk and hug us again. She listens, is so compassionate, offers us real life advice etc. I have had nothing but good experience with any of the OBs and midwives at Providence, not just her, but she shines! Tiffani Jones is also one of my favorite people there (OB) and Stephanie Godfrey (Midwife), just amazing people. Katherine Hull did the surgery and she was incredible as well.

Bottom line, if you're looking for a practice or you know someone who is, they are amazing!",1577613127,"midwives don't do surgery, so i had an ob for that who was really very sweet and compassionate.","sweet and compassionate","compassionate",NA,FALSE,"very sweet and compassionate","sweet",NA,"very",0
"fcc4dvo","Probably the 800th reply, but this topic is dear to my heart.  My daughter was off to college a while back, and I went through all of this.

I look forward to meeting any man who enters my home or interacts with my family the same way I'd interact with any man, I want to find out who they are, which way their moral compass points, what their interests and life trajectory are, and if their life path is walking the same path as my daughters.

My daughter is like her mom and I, on a life/career path that will most likely keep her happy and worry free.

When she was 14, she asked to invite a male friend over.  I'm not sure if you remember Butthead from the Bevis and Butthead cartoons on MTV, but good lawd almighty, if he wasn't a well dressed well educated butthead.  Who was he?, i had no idea.  Where was his moral compass?, I had no idea.  His interests and life path?, no idea.  Was he going in a direction as my daughter?, no idea.   I treated him a lot like I'd treat a stray dog; generally kind and compassionate, but you can't stay here long and no you won't get only steak, only hot dogs and kibble.

When she was 18, she brought home a quite charming young man.  Tall, lean, educated, and confident.   I actually enjoyed talking with him, as he had some life experiences in volunteer work in my state for wildlife conservation.  If you can educate her old man on something he cares about, that's a huge bonus.  Who was he?  He seemed like he had no idea who he was or what he was doing, and was living the next day for the sake of living the next day; this is a great thing for a kid to do, but it doesn't impress me as some one who is going to commit to my daughter.  Or more so, if she commits to him, what path will he taker her down?    Where was his moral compass?  And this is what lost me, he seemed to be out and about dating for the sake of dating, and he never expressed any statement or thoughts about long term relationships with anybody.  Later, my daughter confirmed the same, that he was indeed a cute-tall-lean boy with no idea what happens next.   Was he going in the same direction as my daughter?  Well, maybe.   He didn't have a plan, but really she didn't either.   His interests and life path were his biggest selling point, he was into wildlife conservation and education, and I absolutely hope the best for him.   I treated him a lot like I'd treat a vendor at work, impressed with his confidence and communication skills, happy with his life path, but keeping a bit of difference because i know he'll be gone soon.

&amp;#x200B;

There were 3 more in here: all seemed depressed and focused on alcohol use, and so did my daughter at this time.  Chronic fatigue, black bags under her eyes / their eyes.  Some were cool; they lifted weights and stayed active, nice jobs.  One even reminded me of me.  But she seemed to broadcast to me ""this is Mr Right-Now, not Mr Right"".   I got it.  They never wanted to talk to me, and she didn't want them talking to me.  I knew what was going on.

&amp;#x200B;

When she was 25, she brought home a man.  He struck me as somebody I'd naturally and easily have a conversation with, and that's what we did.  He felt like a friend, in a charming but well-grounded way.  He built houses, but also taught elementary school in a low income neighborhood, managed a LLC with his father, and was on the board of directors for a few environmental conservation groups in town.  That evening, I said the phrase ""Either you marry him, or I will"".  :)     I think they're on 15 years of marriage now.   Know who you are, know where you're heading, and let dad know you're taking her into a direction that is good for her, for him, and for dad.

&amp;#x200B;

Why do dads always act so scary and tough?   I would say that I don't do either, but I can see how it can be taken by others.  I usually retract or reserve all friendliness or charm so I can focus exclusively on understanding this young man.  I am very direct with my questions to know exactly who this person is, who is dating my child.  If you ask a person about their morality, in direct language, and they can't answer or don't know how to answer, then maybe there's a problem.  Maybe they don't know who they are or where they are heading.  I am an adult male, and I know exactly what direction I am going, and I know that if my daughter chose to live at home (god forbid she never does), I would take her on a successful and safe path.  I want a young man to explain to me, or show to me, or let me perceive, the he is going to give her life better than I can.  It's like releasing a baton in a relay race.  I'll keep running laps by myself until she finds a man to settle down with, then I can hand her off.

&amp;#x200B;

You have to know that this litter girl bounced on my knee and giggled with me, we had goofy adventures and art projects and stories and adventures, and I held her close and kept her safe, and her existence over-rode an entire part of my brain.   I didn't know what it was to be a man or a provider until she was born.  As she leaves the family fold and starts her own family, that man better be a good man, and he better keep her safe, and her life must continue on a positive trajectory.

&amp;#x200B;

"" It just makes me not want to get close to you.""   Frankly, none of this has anything to do with the father and you.  :)    If you love her, and make her life better, then dad will see it quickly.

&amp;#x200B;

Some dads will give you crap for the rest of your/his life, just to keep you on your toes and let you know that as easily he gave his daughter away he'll take her back.  Some dads will respect that you're a good mate for his daughter, and will tolerate you.     Some dads will embrace you and pull you into the family.   Like all relationships in life, there are thousands of different ways humans interact, and there's no one way or one word of wisdom that will cross the boundaries of father-in-law / son-in-law relationships.  Really, that's on you to figure out, to accept at what level he is open to relating to you.   Usually, he'll be worried about his little girl for the rest of his life, try to give him reasons to not worry.

"fc5rmaa","It's strange how we are so complex, how we can be so compassionate and sincere but ignorant and nasty all at once. It's a little terrifying too, the idea of believing that you are a good person while simultaneously inflicting pain upon others. I wish I could figure out a way to fully conquer this evil and ignorance, but at the same time, without it, I don't think I would be the same person I am today. Maybe I needed to understand the weight of my actions so that I could understand the importance of empathy and compassion.

I also currently battle depression and social anxiety, so I understand how you felt and how there is a sense of freedom in MBTI, because it allows you to perceive yourself in an entirely new light. At the same time, it makes me feel ingenuine and like a fraud at times, because there are so many paradoxes to who I am. I am compassionate but self-absorbed and melodramatic, imaginative but I can't daydream as vividly as many INFPs, eloquent at times as a writer but also a rambling, incoherent mess like I am at the moment. Essentially, I am confusion :D And I feel this burrowing need to find myself which causes me to overanalyze my personality. I think I have a tendency to place a lot of weight and value on what I identify with, and take it too seriously.   


&gt; it's very much possible that you started doing the ""fitting in"" automatic behaviors from the description of INFP type, while also being an actual INFP on a deeper level (in fact, that would be my guess).

Could you elaborate more on this? This actually what I'm inherently afraid of, that I've absorbed the description of an INFP and it's washed over and defined my entire behavior while not truly being an INFP on a deeper level, on the inside. I guess the reason I feel doubtful that I am truly, inherently an INFP is because of how I used to behave as a child, which does not at all align with the INFP description of being thoughtful and considerate of others. So my deepest underlying fear is that I have mirrored the persona of an INFP, and have, in a way, rewired myself to become an INFP, but underneath it all, I am really not an INFP and another type :(",1577464364,"it's strange how we are so complex, how we can be so compassionate and sincere but ignorant and nasty all at once.","compassionate and sincere","compassionate",NA,FALSE,"so compassionate and sincere","sincere","so",NA,1
"fc5hik0","It depends on the type of therapy, but is the same in a large sense regardless. You start the first sessions just getting to know the person, talking generally about your problems, seeing if you like them and see trust growing, and building what is called a therapeutic alliance. If you did dump all your issues and past on the therapist that first session it would not be wrong or rare, and the therapist could handle that far better than anyone else is likely to, but its certainly not needed. If its short term therapy, 8 to 20 sessions say, the alliance building phase may only be 1 or 2 sessions. If its longer term, more open ended therapy it can last months and months. 

For social anxiety I am going to assume something more limited though, CBT seems likely. That sort of therapy is a bit more goal directed once the therapeutic alliance is built. The therapist is still a therapist, empathetic and compassionate, but its more goal directed, the therapist is more like a teacher or coach. In longer term therapy, psychodynamic and others, the relationship matters more, and there is more just general talking, venting, and dealing with childhood. The longer term therapy is where you'll hear the more cliche therapist stuff, inner child stuff, interpretation of the past and how it reflects on choices now, and such. With shorter term goal focused therapy you will see more workbooks or worksheets, and what is called ""homework"", where you use skills the therapist teaches you in the real world. 

Like if he teaches you breathing techniques to use in social situations you may try that in a social situation, see if it works, and report back next session. If it did great, and you move to another skill, if not you work together as allies in finding out why that proved to be less than helpful of a technique. Shorter term therapies are often likened to a whole toolbox of techniques, its not about deep healing, its about making life better in a day to day. Longer term depth therapy is what helps the core issues, but exactly how depends on therapy type, gets into theory, and is complicated. 

All I can say about long term therapy is that the evidence base of studies shows it helps people just the same, they say it did real good for their core issues, though exactly how is very individualized, and has a lot to do with both theory and the clients particular therapeutic alliance. Short term therapy is far more straightforward, its an evidence tested body of techniques and tools to make the presenting issue better in the day to day, the therapist is teaching it. It absolutely requires a good therapeutic alliance though. All the evidence shows it, for reasons that are poorly understood past common sense, without a person one trusts and feels safe with, likes usually, all the good technique in the world often does little good. 

You should feel not pushed at all for those first couple sessions, but get the vibe you could dump if you needed to, that is the basic idea. Probably the biggest thing is to try to go to every session if you get someone you click with, which their actively trying to do with you. It can't work if you miss sessions, and in short term therapy its a specific number of sessions, maybe that can be extended, but with a framework of how long it will take. In longer term therapy a key is to really try to talk things out with the therapist if you have what is called a rupture, anything from a lack of attunement to a full blown fight, which can and often does happen in longer term therapy. 

Lacks of attunement also happen in short term therapy, but there is not the depth there should be fighting, what is something that can be helpful to work through in long term therapy is usually a red flag in short term therapy. That is the basic idea, just try to click with him as he will be being with you, and if you can't find someone new and try with them. When you find someone you click with just show to every session, or just as close as possible, and be as open as you can be and want to be. That is it, the therapist will help you understand a lot from there. They can explain their particular therapy type, what sort of person they are, and such. That is the basic idea anyway, I hope its helpful. :)",1577457751,"the therapist is still a therapist, empathetic and compassionate, but its more goal directed, the therapist is more like a teacher or coach.","empathetic and compassionate","compassionate",NA,FALSE,"empathetic and compassionate","empathetic",NA,NA,0

"fc0g9az","I'm new to the program, and one thing that I find problematic and confusing is blaming ourselves for for having natural emotions like anger when someone doesn't hold up their end of the bargain. Xmas gifts are not just your responsibility. You should not have to do all the work, then when it comes down to the wire and theres lots more that needs to get done, you have to beg him (to do work that is his job anyway) and he blames you for taking time out to care for yourself. Meanwhile, he's sleeping like a baby each night. Now you are blaming yourself for ""having flaws."" Is anger really a flaw? Is asking him to do some of the work that is his in the first place wrong??? You said it was ""amazing"" that you got some help. Advocating for yourself so that you could get some sleep too is you taking care of your needs. 

These are some things I find difficult to make sense of in the program. Over thanksgiving I had an in-law drunkenly flip out on me when I said I didn't want to watch a video that I found offensive. He played the video anyway and bc I didn't laugh at the racist jokes, he yelled every insult he could think of and then told me to get out of ""his"" house (its my sisters house &amp; I was invited to stay while in town). The next morning my sister made him apologize to me but I told him I didn't want to talk with him, I was still reeling &amp; I didn't want to say things I'd regret. I thought for a couple weeks about how to handle this situation, wanting to talk with him about why I don't feel comfortable around him (now or ever). I'm about 2 months into the program &amp; looking for a sponsor. I met with a potential sponsor and asked for her thoughts on this matter. She told me that if it were her she would let him apologize and not share my thoughts with him, bc apparently that's still playing the role of the victim. Why should he get a chance to speak (again, after he already got to say so much while screaming at me) and I once again have no voice in this situation?

As an Adult Child of and Alcoholic, and being raised in a dysfunctional home where I had no voice, it took a lot of work for me to learn how to stand up for myself. I thought that Al-Anon would help me be more compassionate when dealing with the qualifiers in my life. I just recently got out of an emotionally abusive relationship, in which (after 2 years of trying to kindly ask for him to be more mindful of the hurtful things he'd say and do) I eventually became very bitter and resentful and angry. He then started calling me abusive bc I was angry. I came into the program having been gaslit, ""maybe I could have handled things better, maybe I am part of the reason our relationship became so dysfunctional."" I literally apologized to HIM.

To start, from the comments you indicated that you've tried to work through whatever you're feeling with him, and that it hasn't worked out. That's a good start, and in the end will help him move on. When my ex broke up with me I was pretty blindsided by it, and I never even knew she was feeling like she wanted to break up. I'd like to think that she tried to communicate it to me, in her own way, but if she did it wasn't in a way I could understand. It made me feel like our relationship didn't mean much to her and that she didn't even want to bother working it out.


In terms of actually going about breaking up with him, being direct about it and telling him how you honestly feel is going to help him heal in the long run. Be prepared to for him to plead for another chance or say that he will change (especially if it's something he honestly believes he can change). 


Be compassionate, but firm. When my ex broke up with me, I laid out all the things I would do to change, and made clear I would do them whether or not she was with me. I told her I wished we could be together for it. Her reply to that was ""I can't give you an answer right now"". I knew in my heart she was trying to be polite, but I clung to those words with all I had. I gave her space because it was what she wanted, but her telling me that did way more harm than good and I've never really gotten over her saying that.

"fbtwus3","Hi Benny,   
I got some new ides from this thread. I’m new to reddit, but I liked your explanation and way of thinking.   
 

You used the phrase “compassionate capitalism”. I personally don’t believe that most people are compassionate, but most do however know the difference between right and wrong. You say that at some point one has to equate a human’s life to their dollar value. I believe that we are already doing that when we have soldiers protecting oilfields in other parts of the world and dying for it. It’s not the most noble of deaths or sacrifices. I wonder if the soldiers dying for that cause is aware of that.   
 

But I do like the idea of capitalism isn’t the cause of war but rather a structure that promotes it.  
That at least gives me hope that we can fix it.   
 

So domestically inside a country people and corporations obviously aren’t killing each other over markets and resources. Because of laws and regulations.   
At least in theory, wouldn’t laws and regulations on a global scale be a solution to this tyrannical element in capitalism?, what would those laws and regulations be? and how would it be enforced?

Anakin was also way overpowered for a little kid, but whatever. Rey grew up on a scavenger planet and had to fend for herself since day one. She had to learn to defend herself early on if she wanted to survive. The reason she's so good with a lightsaber is because she's already good with her staff. It didn't come out of nowhere. Now the reason she knows how to pilot the Falcon is probably because 1) she has flown before although she's never left Jakku, 2) she knows her way around a ship, knows which parts do what, 3) she has the Force. Yeah I know the third point looks unconvincing, but remember that Anakin knew how to take apart and rebuild droids when he was like 5 or 6 (TPM). It's not that much of a stretch that Rey could have learned to pilot a ship by herself. Now, I was as disappointed as everyone when I learned about Luke, but looking back on it it made more sense to me. Luke wasn't a very nuanced character in the OT, or at least not to me. He was unquestionably Good and compassionate. But people are rarely 100% unquestionably good and it makes sense that he was so afraid that Ben would turn that he let his emotions overcome him. Also Luke did not grow up with the Jedi teachings like most Jedi did. He started using his abilities consciously when he was around 19 years old I think and his two mentor figures died before they could teach him about them all. In the end Luke's purpose in ROTJ was that of a hermit mentor. He was basically Yoda's mirror. I actually really liked the homage to Yoda in the movie, but I understand how some fans might view it as uncreative because it's a rehash of ESB. About Han, well I was honestly not surprised at all to learn that he had been absent from Ben's life. We can only speculate a little about Ben's childhood but I'm sure multiple factors were at play when he decided to kill him other than the fact that Han was a deadbeat dad. In my mind Ben didn't care for his dad because he wasn't as legendary as Luke or Vader in his mind. There's a lot we don't know behind Ben's motives beyond ""Snoke told him to"" and the fact that he had been trying to emulate Vader and fully turn to the Dark side.

Here the problem seems less to be that you just did something out of line and more that your relationship with this person is getting stuck in a pattern where you're both treating eachother badly sometimes?

"fbcor8w","&gt; How collapse will differ from a conventional disaster, the specifics are yet to be seen.

The difference is that everyone knows that disasters will end. No ones going to start murdering their neighbors for food when they know FEMA (and rule of law) are just around the corner. 

All you have to do to see what happens when a disaster doesn’t end is to look at Katrina. As soon as it was clear that the city was on its own for the time being, then the stealing and killing started happening all over. There was police murdering survivors, gangs of homeowners murdering black ‘looters’, and plenty of cases of people killed that still haven’t been solved. And this was after like a week without outside support.

It’s ludicrous to think that we’ll all be getting together and singing kumbaya once it’s obvious that help isn’t coming and the disaster is never ending.

&gt;That’s not necessarily a strike against Hart’s system per se. I suppose it’s fine if he wants to act like a cosmic Santa Claus, giving the best possible reality to his readers. And maybe his temporary Hell (Catholics call it “purgatory”) would have obscene torments that we should try to save people from. But if eternal suffering is unacceptable, why is any other sort of suffering acceptable? Why is one thousand or one trillion years of Hell perfectly compassionate, but eternal Hell is a bridge too far? What are we even talking about at that point? For me, a year is still a long time. Does this conversation really matter? Maybe we are trying to avoid a slippery slope by evading the question of the first year freshman college student in Philosophy 101: If God is just, why do we suffer? And if this question is ridiculous, what’s the point of objecting to an eternal Hell? Eternal Hell just seems uncouth, I suppose.

&gt;I will close (thankfully!) with the other significant objection to Hell that Hart posits, and that is, if God is to be “all in all”, it makes no sense that there is a nook in the transfigured cosmos that continues to be the realm of His enemies, like a fly in the ointment. I see the point he’s trying to make here, and I have believed it myself at times, but I don’t think that the orthodox Christian perspective offers any real solution here. Even if there is a “restoration” of all things and a return of the cosmos to God, the question will always be, “But was it worth it?” Was it worth the mother seeing her infant slain before her, was it worth the theft, the hatred, and the betrayal it all took to get there, even if everyone does indeed “get there”? It could be argued that one is also just kicking the can down the road, and Hart is implying that “God’s ways are not our ways, etc,” echoing an argument he has already dismissed. Whether Hart and his fellow universalists draw the line here or elsewhere remains to be seen.

"falwa4d","The first thing I want to do is point out that your boyfriend doesn’t have a gaming addiction. The DSM-V no longer uses the term addiction and uses the term dependence instead. However in order to qualify for dependence the person must be able to develop tolerance and have withdrawal when removed from the dependent activity. I am not pointing this out to be pedantic, it is very important when discussing mental health that we understand exactly which terms apply and how those terms interact with medical professionals. The DSM-V does not recognize internet gaming disorder as an illness and only something that requires further study. 

What your boyfriend has is often referred to as gaming disorder or internet gaming disorder. Which is when gaming becomes so compulsive that it interferes with normal daily activities. It is important to point out that there is significant debate in this area in the research, but the current consensus is that your boyfriend is likely covering some other mental health issue with gaming. These issues can include depression, anxiety, and/or other mood disorders.

Now what can you do about it? The best plan of action is to be compassionate but firm. First be compassionate. Try to get him to talk to you about why he is ignoring you for his games. You must make it known that currently your needs are being ignored and that he is not providing you with what you need in the relationship. Even if you can get him to open up you have to move to the next step which is. You must then make your presence contingent on his seeking professional help for whatever it is that is bothering him (or if he claims nothing is bothering him, then he seek help for his clear compulsion for gaming). The reason for this is that a mental health issue is not something that someone just gets over or that goes away even if he does open up and changes his behavior in the immediate sense. It is almost certain that these behaviors will return with time. The most important thing is the firmness. You must be willing to end this relationship to show that his actions will result in him loosing you. It may be that he chooses this rout and you never see him again. But enough times of this from enough people and maybe he will realize that his actions are harming him and he will seek the help that he needs.

In my life, I met a lot of women with characteristics associated with male sex and a lot of men with characteristics associated with female sex. In the end, my conclusion was that personality or virtues aren't determined by gender they were born with. There might be a correlation, but there are too many exceptions to the rule.

Instead of focusing on masculine or female virtues, we need to teach our children to be most virtuous version of themselves. If the boy is caring and compassionate, but cowardly, then we should encourage him into their direction. If a girl is very ambitious, then we should encourage her to become more driven and do ambitious things. If you try to force someone into who they aren't, you will cause trauma and problems.

Not to mention, many, if not all, virtues are unisex: the loyalty and duty to ones' family and their community, compassion to their neighbors, courage to do something right and holding civic duties seriously.

"f9nmf6a","I’ve been reinstated before myself.  It was a horrific ordeal.  I was doing everything right by jw standards, but it took 2 years and 3 letters and meetings before it finally happened.  And i had to move across the state to a different elder body to make it happen.  When my original committee still didn’t want to reinstate me, my elders had to get our circuit overseer to work with the other elders circuit overseer to approve my reinstatement.  

The types of questions asked by the two committees varied greatly.  I was DFed for “two acts of fornication” and immediately told on myself.  But they said since i did it twice, it showed a pattern of sexual sin and so they wanted to make sure that i had completely “deadened my sexual desires.”  Aside from asking if i had committed any more immorality, they asked about porn, even if i was ever aroused by things like the sports illustrated swimsuit issue or advertisements.   They asked if i had flirted with anyone or had fantasies.  They asked about my masturbation habits.   Ultimately, i had to not masturbate for 6 months to get reinstated.  
 
They also asked if i thought i was wicked and deserving of death.  The first time i said, no, that i was just sinful but i did love Jehovah and want to please him - wrong answer.  So the next time i made sure to make it clear that i knew i was wicked just like satan.  It’s also important to make clear to them that you don’t miss your family and friends.  You aren’t sad about being cut off the them.  The only thing that eating at you is your overwhelming guilt for sinning against Jehovah and the congregation and grieving the Holy Spirit.  You need to display “godly sadness” instead of “worldly sadness.”  There is a 1987 watchtower series of articles about “fruits that befit repentance” that they base all of it on.  

In your situation, since  you are awake, you can just lie to them.  I was a full believer so i told them everything.  

Maybe your elders will be nicer and more compassionate, but that was my experience and i wouldn’t wish it on anyone.  If i had to do it over again, i never would have come back.  

I’ve faded and most of my JW family and friends shun me anyways (never said anything “apostate” to anyone - I’m just inactive and the borg tells them they should shun inactive people now).

"f9jir2e","This post was x-posted to r/EntitledBitch. I posted the following comment there, and it received a good response, so I thought it would be okay to comment here as well:



It’s really a tragic situation from all sides. It’s an abhorrent thing to do, to take your dying daughter’s pain medication away, for your own personal relief, denying her even a modicum of comfort at the end of her life. It’s not what one would consider an excusable behavior. 

It’s perfectly understandable why observers would hate this woman, and consider her the absolute scum of the earth. And hate is an absolutely valid feeling as a response to it. And, depending on the metric you’re using, ‘absolute scum of the earth’ could be an accurate assessment. 

But the truth is that this story most likely doesn’t belong in r/EntitledBitch. Because it was probably not an act borne of entitlement. This woman is clearly so hopelessly entrenched in her chemical addictions, it’s no longer the person who is exhibiting the behavior, it’s the addiction. 

Addiction is a disease (though some refuse to recognize it as such) that strips away your values, morals, empathy; it destroys your conception of priorities, excepting the drug. It destroys your capacity for forethought, for imagining the future cost of immediate choices. It muscles out your very personality, and leaves a ghost of a person with a singular objective. 

Chemical addiction hijacks the circuitry in our brains that evolution installed to compel us to survive. *Hungry. Eat this or you will **die**. Thirsty. Drink water or you will **die**. Afraid. Escape the lion or you will **die**.* A chemical addiction causes this circuitry to subconsciously compel the person to take a drug no matter the cost, because just like hunger or thirst, failure to do so means certain death, even though that’s (usually) not the case with the drug.

That circuitry exists in the lower brain, sometimes called the reptilian brain. The part of us that we consider *us* — our personality, morals, values, empathy, honor, etc. — that all resides in the prefrontal cortex, which is a part of the brain that can be easily overridden by the reptilian brain (certainly this is reductive, but accurate). 

My point is that people who are casualties of addiction are not bad people (speaking in generalities). They aren’t weak, or immoral, or stupid, or malicious. In fact, they are disproportionately intelligent, sensitive, and compassionate. But the addiction overpowers these qualities, which is why the common belief among the uninitiated is that addicts are just awful disgusting selfish assholes. And yes, while in the clutches of addiction, they can be those things. But they didn’t start out that way, and they don’t have to stay that way; they can heal and become themselves again. 

Like anything, it isn’t black and white, and it’s vastly more complex than what’s visible on the surface. It’s a disease which, like most any other, isn’t your fault. A certain percentage of human brains are susceptible to chemical addictions, and that is the massively predominant factor. 

So good people end up doing horrible things as a puppet of an agent which causes them, and everyone around them, great suffering. And outsiders have a slim chance of understanding this and therefore being able to help, rather than condemn. And that is why it’s tragic, from every angle. 

The more that we as a society can do to educate each other about addiction, to treat it as a public health issue instead of a criminal issue, to support research and treatment, support those of us directly and indirectly harmed by addiction, and bolster our capacity for understanding and compassion, the more we will reduce the harm caused by addiction. And working in that direction, it will without a doubt be virtually eradicated sometime in our future. 

Unfortunately, posting a victim of addiction in ~~r/EntitledBitch~~ r/trashy and bathing in the intoxicating feeling of our contempt and hatred for that victim, is not a step in the right direction. I’m not judging, honestly. I’m here too. I’m just saying. It’s all just shitty from all sides.

"f9im5x2","One of my past partners opened up to me about similarly intense physical abuse, not exactly what you describe but a kind of similar level of intensity. I am *very glad* she opened up because it made it much easier for me to avoid triggering her in any way. It also helped me to understand her skiddishness with certain types of situations.

It did freak me out a bit. I think the hardest thing for me was when I met her parents...it was hard for me to even interact with them at all knowing what they had done to her. Thankfully, we didn't have to interact much.

But even if it did cause me to feel a bit uncomfortable in that moment, there's no way I would have wanted her to hold that in, especially as close as we were.

I also strongly agree with what /u/frog_spawn said that past abuse doesn't make you weak at all. I tend to see people as strong when they open up about past abuse. I've experienced a small amount of minor abuse from several different people in my life, but even that took a lot of strength to get through and collect myself from. I can only imagine what it took for other people to get through the more intense things they have described experiencing.

I don't know if others would always be as understanding. I do think that being a victim of survivor of some types of abuse myself, have made me more understanding of more extreme or severe types of abuse. It's like, I have the weird triggers, the PTSD-like reactions, the trauma that I had to kind of process, certain things that took years to work through. So it's easier for me to understand by analogy, easier for me to be empathetic and compassionate.

But I also think that people who have no experience with abuse can still be compassionate and empathetic and understanding, and if someone isn't, you probably wouldn't want to date them.

Does this mean you will want to open up to everyone, or open up all at once? Not necessarily. You can always share things gradually.  For example you can start out with your option (2) and then move to (3) later. Like, you can say: ""I don't do X, Y, and Z."" and leave it at that. Or, especially if someone asks some questions, you could throw in: ""I may explain more about why later, once we are a little closer.""

You also, especially if you find a partner you feel very safe with, may want to try confronting and working through some of your triggers. I have managed to do that with some of them and it is very empowering. This is a process you can do to an extent, both alone (by thinking or writing about them) and with others, and you can also do it in therapy if you have access to a therapist you feel comfortable with.

So yeah, you have lots of options for how to navigate this stuff; you can share as little or as much as you want. But I want you to know that it can be quite good to open up with this, if you get comfortable enough to do so!",1575340500,"so it's easier for me to understand by analogy, easier for me to be empathetic and compassionate.","empathetic and compassionate","compassionate",NA,FALSE,"empathetic and compassionate","empathetic",NA,NA,0

"f9fz7ax","Communism emphasizes the belief that people should prop each other up, that the welfare of the collective, the society, the nation or the people is more important then the welfare of the individual. At face value this makes sense - humane and compassionate, but non-optional since that compassion is state-mandated. This expresses itself through an enforced cultural homogeneity (dissent against the commune cannot be tolerated, so information control is enacted) and a strict control on the economy, mandating production and consumption levels, to ensure everyone gets what is deemed a fair share, and everyone stays happy.

The problem, of course, is that people are not born equal. Some are smarter. Some are stronger. Some are more cunning. Communism prevents these people from reaching their full potential and reaping the rewards of it, thus you will often see the most capable of a society leave such a society. Businesses are also not incentivized to be efficient since their targets are set. This leads to stagnation and decline, especially in the economic sense.

"f7arryy","I would also say, congratulating too much, and encouraging too much, without talking to your child about what their hopes, struggles, and fears are is also incredibly damaging as well.

I spent most of my high school experience helping make sure my overpressured, and abused classmates didn’t kill themselves, and if I I learned anything in high school, it’s that so often, parents have no idea how close they have come to losing their children. Especially the overly loving, “I just want my children to succeed!” parents, the “my child will not fail or so help me god”, or the “I’m here to be your parent not your friend” kinda of parents. They just don’t understand how hard they are making their children’s lives by trying to “encourage” them to be perfect at everything. There’s a healthy balance between the extremes of encouragement and extraordinary expectations, but being too extreme on either end can lead to similarly extreme mental struggles. And these people’s parents would either have absolutely no idea how much their child was struggling, or would simply think that being cheery and overly supportive would help solve the deeper struggles their children were going through.

Honestly, looking back, it’s horrifying how many people told me that I saved their life. And though I was often unaware of the impact I was having in their lives at the time, looking back, I can absolutely see how I was the last thing they had trying to help convince them to hold on for just a little longer. And it should never have come so far as to rely on some random kid who didn’t know what they were doing to get them just enough help to survive. Sure, I was sincere and compassionate. But I was also inexperienced, untrained, and naive. So many people had to drop the ball on so many levels before I could have ever have ended up being all that was left, and it’s heartbreaking to me. These people needed professional help, and the love of those around them to help them get there, and help them get through their struggles, not some nobody kid who just happened to be good at picking up on when people were hiding their struggles. They truly needed a village. And so often, I’d hear “I have no idea why I’m telling you this. I’ve never really told this to anybody but...”. And while I’m grateful for the chances I’ve had to make a difference in people’s lives, holy cow, I was just a kid. I had no idea what I was doing, and it’s purely luck that whatever I was doing seemed to help. And while I wouldn’t trade the friends I had made for the world, but I would trade the world for them to have had at least one adult who they could trust and confide in. They needed so much more wisdom than I was capable of offering in high school. And it’s a miracle that they made it at all.

And these weren’t the people who’s parents saw they were struggling and tried to help their children overcome their struggles. These weren’t the people having breakdowns in the hallway, or the kids who lashed out in their pain. These were the “perfect” kids who never did anything wrong, and never, ever failed a test, let alone a class. And one day, something would be off. They would act fine, but they’d smile less and less. And they’d still smile externally and act like everything was fine, but inside, something was wrong. Andnit was so devilishly subtle that a huge portion of the people around them would miss it. And their parent’s expectations isolated them from their own families, nomatter how loving they were, and so those kids could never ask for help, because even if they knew how to ask, how would they ever be worthy of the success their parents claimed they were destined for if they couldn’t overcome this tiny little speedbump of crippling depression on their own?

And to give my school credit, we had extraordinary teachers who were spectacularly good at picking up on these things and helping people through them, but the fact still is, so many of these people’s parents spent way too much time encouraging their children, and not enough time building a real relationship based on trust and communication with their children. These people didn’t just have nobody to talk to, they didn’t even know HOW to talk about their struggles with the people around them who could have, and would have wanted to help them.",1573537768,"sure, i was sincere and compassionate.","sincere and compassionate","compassionate",NA,FALSE,"sincere and compassionate","sincere",NA,NA,0
"f79z1mh","I'm a Taurus Sun, Scorpio Moon, Scorpio Asc. Also, Gemini Mercury.

Generally I get along pretty well with most people, I'm a quiet person who avoids conflict whenever I can but I also enjoy a good conversation, and mostly try to do what I can to help people without getting in their way because (especially as I get older) I tend to have a lot of empathy for others and do my best to understand their perspectives. But despite my best efforts to avoid conflict, I'm often rankled by people who are selfish and needlessly critical/insulting of others. And of course the tendency to support something only because it's currently popular (and judge others based on trends) and drop it the second it stops being popular bothers me quite a lot as well - I find something innately disingenuous about that. And it's been my experience that everytime I meet such a person who espouses those sort of qualities -- often enough under the guise of being the most ""intellectual"" or ""cultural"" person in the room -- they turn out to be an Aquarian. 

In some instances they might not be, as I don't always learn a person's sign of course, but that has been the recurring pattern so far. It includes, among others, my step-father (just an unpleasant man all around), my female friend's ex-wife who was emotionally/mentally abusive to her and very manipulative, and a guy in a post-college friend group who was always trying to manipulate the group into agreeing solely with what he wanted with no consideration for anyone else or any other views (and I thought he had some pretty harsh and offensive beliefs) and had some really bad breakup with his girlfriend who remained in the group after we kicked him out. Despite being a ""bull"" I often feel like I take on the role of protecting friends or family from Aquarians who act like bullies.

The one and only exception in my life was the Aquarius girl I dated in sixth and seventh grade who was incredibly kind and compassionate, but then I don't know what sort of adult she grew up into... I can only hope she stayed the good person she was (I don't know, she and her family moved far away in the middle of 8th grade and staying in touch online wasn't a thing yet).

I do hope my bad experiences are the exception rather than the rule. It might just be a long streak of bad luck, just meeting the worst Aquarians. But at this point, my guard immediately goes up once I find out someone is Aquarius. I try to give them a chance to prove me wrong, of course. Or I just try to extricate myself from their presence.",1573517557,"the one and only exception in my life was the aquarius girl i dated in sixth and seventh grade who was incredibly kind and compassionate, but then i don't know what sort of adult she grew up into...","kind and compassionate","compassionate",NA,FALSE,"kind and compassionate","kind",NA,NA,0

"f775zmm","""Okay, look.""  I open with, rolling the words in my mouth along with the cigarette, trying to figure out how to explain this and also putting a lot of effort into not drawing my service weapon.  ""Have you considered, maybe, that what you are doing is a crime?""

""The laws of an unjust tyrant are no laws at all, to the noble!""  The knight replied in a booming, charismatic voice.  

God, fucking dammit, he really was a knight.  Like, capital-K took-class-levels-in-it Knight.

For a while, we'd thought we'd seen the last of these.  But they keep showing up, every few years now. Causing trouble, usually causing a lot of deaths, too.  They always had that palpable charisma around them.  And it was at this point that I realized I'd made a mistake.

 I think the biggest mistake that I've made in my life was joining the service in the first place.  'Make the world safer' got a lot more appealing after the Restructuring, and I'd wanted to... I dunno, have a shot at making something better.  The fact that they let me be kinda snarky was a plus, as long as I got results. The results, usually, were breaking up fights between drunks or giving compassionate but firm talks to the local kids when they went a bit too far with a prank.

The second biggest mistake I'd ever made was being a week away from retirement.  Honestly, I'd kinda walked into that one.

And now, here I was.  Standing on the street corner at the intersection of Main and Third, trying to hold out my hands to convince a madman with a magic sword to stand the fuck down.

""Okay, so, look.  Here's the thing.""  I rubbed my forehead.  ""I know that you guys never listen to this, but we'd really prefer you didn't try to murder our elected government.""

""Your tyrant king will fall before my blade!""  The knight yelled back.  ""All those who stand with the corrupt shall be purged!""

""Yeah, look, buddy, I'm really trying to tell you.  We aren't a monarchy.""  I gestured around, trying to get this dude to look at the clean sidewalks, the park that was a literal dump not even ten years ago, the worried looking crowd that was rapidly clearing out as they realized what variety of man was shouting.  ""This is a socialist democracy, at most.  We don't have tyrants, except maybe for the city planning counci.  But they mean well.""

""All shall!... I'm sorry, you're not a what?""  The Knight's booming voice faltered for a second.  And in that instant, I felt like I could see his polished breastplate shine just a little less.  

""Monarchy.""  I told him.  ""We don't have kings.  We elect our leaders.  Well, 'leader' is the wrong word.  We elect experts and managers based on credentials and, these days, a more complex machine intelligence that pairs public charisma with specific ability.""

The Knight looked vaguely confused by that.  I didn't blame him, I was too, until my daughter had explained it to me.  I let my hands drop, keeping them away from my weapon, but no longer quite so tense.  This was, honestly, new ground.  Normally Knights didn't open dialogue; they just started brainwashing and killing until they were put down.

""But your world... is ruled by the dragons.""

""Well, I mean, parts of it?  Again, 'ruled' is the wrong word.  'Managed', maybe?  Sometimes dragons get elected.  A lot of them are good at what they do; being a few hundred years old does that.  A lot of them *don't* get elected, though.""  I shrugged; honestly, forty years of living alongside another species did wonders for an integrated society.  ""Makes sense, though.  A lot of humans don't get elected either.  *I'm* not gonna be put on the city planning council anytime soon, you know?""

The Knight shook his head, looking around through helmeted eyes as if seeing the world for the first time.  He drove his sword into the asphalt, the enchanted blade sliding into the road like it was butter. ""I... I do not understand.  I thought that in coming here, I could slay great evil...."" He sounded almost sad.

I gave him a sympathetic wince as I answered.  ""Yeah, man, we don't really have that anymore.  I mean, some people are evil, sure, but ever since the global reforms, the police are pretty good at making sure that murderers and rapists and sh.. stuff.. get taken to justice.  I'm sorry, but we just don't have any monsters for you to kill.""

The Knight dropped to his knees.  ""I left my world behind, for this.""  He said.  ""They told me that I would be a hero.""  The whispered words barely made it through the helm.

I walked up to him, and gently set a hand on the shoulder of his armor.  ""I get it.  I do.  Things get... turned upside down, sometimes.""  He looked up at me, almond eyes peering out through the slits of his helmet, and I gave him the best cop smile I had.

&gt;But because I'm a compassionate human being I'm going to respect their beliefs and use the words they're most comfortable with so that we can build upon each other instead of tearing each other around.

You begin by saying your compassionate. 

&gt;You're choosing to literally belittle millions, maybe a billion or more people all over the world. You're choosing to minimize their own feelings and struggles. Get over yourself, you might actually find something beautiful and amazing on the other side of the shit show hill you've dumped over your limited and extremely judgemental lifetime. 

 Then in a slightly less thay respectful way you tell me im belittling millions or billions. (Which i didnt) i wasnt belittling a single human, you are a idiot who seems to lack in the reading comprehension aspect of life. I literally said the opposite.

Fyi, The study found that 97.4% of men identified as heterosexual, 1.6% as homosexual and 0.9% as bisexual. For women 97.7% identified as heterosexual, 0.8% as lesbian and 1.4% as bisexual, stop lying.

&gt;They're not telling anyone to call their penis Ms. Outie McVaggie, they're asking you to call their human selves what they feel most comfortable. This isn't technicality, this is the human experience which can't be explained and analyzed to any perfect degree as: he's got a penis, he's a him no matter what. What would you have done in your life if everyone had taken their first impression judgment of you and never changed it to fit what you grew into? Does mommy still come change your diapers? I'm guessing she's accepted that you didn't need them anymore, thank goodness or you'd be one screwed up individual. I'm so glad I get to choose who I am and not leave it up to people like you.

Then in an act of sheer idiocracy you decide to bellittle me, shame me and tell me im trying to tell people what to be. Nowhwere have i said that, again quite the opposite.  You act as if you are high and mighty and compassionate but in reality you are worse than i am. I at least try to accommodate 100% of the population in my line of thought. You only care about 4% of the population. I also take science into account, peoples mental health into account and a multitude of other feelins to try and come to a healthy conclusion.  Ie my whole argument is based around gender being a social construct which of removed woukd allow people to be what e er they want while still having the organs they were born with.bits a very simple and understanding concept. But since it means that the 2 sexs ie male and female are still prevalent people like you who are undereducated and running off a victim complex dont seem to get the satisfaction you want of making  billions of people feel bad ,becasue in all reality they dont give a flying fuck if you want to change what ever you want to change.

"f6v22lo","Teaching is really fucking hard. I don't care what district you're in. I taught in Philly, and the poorer parts of the burbs, and out-of-state in a rural District.

Philly was tough, but based on the comments here y'all think the school has zero parent support and all the children are animals. I still had active parents and 80% of my kids came to learn... They just had really REALLY shitty circumstances at home. Some of the stories you'll hear are just mind blowing. But on a day-to-day the classroom really wasn't any different than teaching in most other places. You had to come in firm, but compassionate. 

 But being a poor big city also has it's big advantages. Universitoes and charities love sponsoring new programs and technology. Poorer rural districts don't get that. 

The worst was rural out of state. The pay was trash, the classrooms brand new, and parents who couldn't have given two less shits about their kid's school day. 

As far as solutions: I'm on board charter schools, or at least giving students options. At worst, I'd say charter schools are the imperfect solution. I'm also very much for Year Round School and think it does wonders for kids in difficult environments where summers are difficult. For any school, small class size is crucial. Field trips and seeing a different environment is important. And, this is a big one - take kids into an environment where they have to MEET people different than them. I sponsor a school program now that does face-to-face between professionals and city HS students. If you've never grown up around middle class white people, it's really difficult to be expected to know how to be confident in an environment outside your own. 

When it comes to discipline, I agree with the sentiment of removing a disruptive child from the general program. But how Philly does it is throw you into Camelot for as long as the school can. There needs to be better wrap-around mental health services to address behavioral issues. In suburban schools, a child acting out would quickly be given a CST eval.

It's just fucking rude. 

Another point I'd like to add, is that this person is your ex wife and you have kids together and you probably lived together for a period of time? I would assume that your desire for diet ginger ale has been around for a while and she probably knows that they're yours and doesn't give a shit about helping herself to your stuff. People commenting on the dad not being compassionate to wife because kids can see it, the kids also probably see that mom is downing dads soda and is that really setting a good example for boundaries or respect? Her own example is teaching her kids to not care about other people's belongings. 

Also, how long are her drop offs lasting for her to be in your house having a few sodas and making a sandwich? Growing up, my civil divorced parents kept their drop offs to 10 minutes at the most?

I would say I am a fairly kind person, and I give to charity on a regular basis. That charity is on my own consent, and I certainly don't allow people to just walk into my home and take things on their own accord. Not to mention, I usually go above and beyond to reciprocate any kind gesture someone extends my way because I think it shows how much you appreciate it.

If your ex wife is struggling and needs to eat, that's one thing. This situation is not about someone who is struggling to feed themselves. If I was having money issues and was trying to sneak a quick snack and hopefully go unnoticed to not be embarrassed, I would make my presence as minimal as possible by only getting the bare minimum and DEFINITELY clean up after myself. If it were me, I would try to find a way to address the situation in a civil, compassionate, but informative way so she knows that you're still on ""team coparenting"" but it's not OK to come into your home without your permission finish your stash. Your kids need to know the importance of respecting boundaries but also compassion to others during tough times.

"f5tgel6","I think this is spot on. Honest and open communication is super-key to this. Just be real with your partner and let them be real with you. I like the part about owning your part and giving him (supported) room to process the information you'll share with him at your next sit-down chat. Be compassionate, but still honest about your feelings and why this relationship style is appealing to you.

There's a potential version of this that ends with the two of you going in separate directions at the end of this; but it doesn't have to be that way. He may be open to it but never explored that deep within himself to know if this is something he's actually into as well. Just be honest with him. Also, you're in a committed relationship, so his feelings about it matter, too. And if staying in this monogamous relationship long-term (knowing all of this) isn't right for you, then maybe this shapes out differently later on. I mean, there's poly people out there who are open poly, but the meta is monogamous...so that's another way this could work out. But only if that meta is good with it.

As bun bun mentioned, it's about the protocols and boundaries you set for yourselves already, and whether or not both people in the current relationship (as it currently stands) want to make a dynamic change to the relationship. Poly is a new thing to this relationship as far as he's concerned, so it may take some help to get him there. 

Also, I personally identify as polyamorous, but am currently not comfortable sharing my partner. Does that mean never? No. I'm not looking for someone else right now. But I know within myself that I am capable of loving more than one, so I associate with the poly label. I've not dated as a poly person, either.

**OYS #13**

**STATS:** Age 50, wife 49. 4 kids. 5’7’ 153 lbs. 10 months in to RP journey

**Physical:** Loving lifting but still small. I go every other day. I lowered reps to 5-7 to increase weight. I’ve done no single amount max just keep doing reps. Squat: 145 (laugh all you want and call me a faggot but you have to start somewhere). Barbell bench – 130, Overhead press – 90, Lat pulls: 140, Curls: 100, Rope press down – 70. No surf this week. Kayak fished this week in the wind – killer arm and back workout.

**Reading:** The biblical masculinity blueprint. For anyone who just likes knowledge even if you don’t believe in Christ or the bible – I recommend reading this. Author has a red pill blog and doesn’t write from a “sharing his faith” perspective. Interesting to see how most of what we talk about and work on here is directly out of the bible.

**Spiritual:** This is the same song and dance. Haven’t gone to church and still don’t want to. I’m not going to return to the kind of mega church where I’ve been going. I am most likely going to find a smaller place without the churchianity where I can give my time and talents. Talked off line with Rocknrollchuck this week. Very helpful, that guy is the real deal.

**Relationship:** Holy shit. Last week Horns and Hack3ge both told me what I thought was the main event a month or so ago wasn’t what I thought and that she was close but to keep on. I was not so sure but I thought about it and just kept on doing my thing. Thursday night, after a long day I decided to leave for the gym. She told me she wished I would stay and spend the evening here. So I said back, “How about you use your feminine wiles and keep me here?” She said, “Nah.” “Ok, I’ll be back when I am finished” without frustration or butthurt(I promise). I thought about the whole main event thing at the gym and about the last month and I realized that the relationship quality and the sex quality had dwindled considerably and that I wasn’t living out any real exchange of power except for the decision to live my own life. Fast forward to Sunday morning where we are laying very comfortably together and I am laying out some dreams I have for the next couple of years for my life– really fun, good stuff and to give comfort I told her that she was still my first choice to have along with me... 

And then all the fun dynamics changed. “I really don’t like this term, ‘first choice’, you keep using. You make me feel like there is a second choice. What if, say in five years, I don’t live up to your expectations, what are you going to do?”(Clearly, the hamster has still been at work). I simply told her I am not five years down the road and I can’t answer that but I am not going to live my next 20 years with regrets or less than what I am capable of having. “So will you just leave me?” I just went broken record…”I’m not five years down the road and I can’t answer that…” but told her I have full faith that she had so much more to give and that she can step up and do it. I laid out clearly what I want and told her that she had the tools to do it. BUT I TOLD HER IF I HAVE MESSED THIS RELATIONSHIP UP SO BADLY WITH MY 20 YEARS OF (BLUE PILL) BULLSHIT, JUST TELL ME THAT IT IS NOT THERE FOR YOU AND THAT WILL BE OK. I DON’T WANT TO WASTE YOUR TIME OR MINE. “You are so cold and unemotional about this.” And then came a flood of tears, sobbing and shaking. She leaves the bed and starts walking around the room folding clothes, sitting down, crying, then walking around and then sitting. Shaking and crying. “This conversation is terrifying!” You are terrifying me!” “I will not be in a relationship where the threat of leaving is always over my head if I don’t measure up, that is not unconditional love!” “You need to make a decision if you are in or out!” Then she went on about all kinds of fear the thought of separating being dreadful and that my expectations were not realistic and so on… I knew this was all fear talking.  Things were silent for a while and I sat on the bed facing her with compassionate but unwavering eyes as she was on the other side of the room. I knew those guys were right and I was now in the middle of it. My head was swirling and I was trying to keep everything I had learned in order mentally, but I still felt strong and in control. I finally broke the silence and said none of what she said is true and that she is just afraid. I told he that the last several weeks the relational and sexual quality was terrible. Little romance, little fun together, poor sex and a lot of turn downs on her part. I told her that she was giving me very little to nothing. I told her that SHE needed to make a decision of what she wanted but that my expectations will not change. Then I said unconditional love only means so much, that if I weighed 300 lbs, ate Cheetos all day and played video games, you would have every right to leave the house until I got my shit in order. I told her to get up and come over with me which she did and laid on my chest quietly whimpering. I didn’t flinch, deer or cave at all, I just held her while she cried, then I said, “I’ve given you what I desire and you are fully capable and I believe you have so much more in you to give. You have to step up because I am not going to do all of the work. What you think scares you is actually your safety because knowing exactly what I want, there is no ambiguity, so it is up to you if you want to stay on board.” This was her red pill moment because after a long silence of whimpering she said, “I have to come to the realization that relationships have risk and the opportunity for someone to leave is there if they are not happy.” Our families are outside of the norm – there are no divorces in either of our siblings 10 marriages or either of our parents. That thought is so far out of her realm that dread was tough because relational Disneyland was there for her. So it looks like I am having many events, not just one. **This was big and I am thinking what I am seeing is her internal, unconscious struggle of always having covert power in the relationship through controlled sexuality and emotional reactivity from me and all of that power is gone. It seems like it is a see-saw between fear of the familiar and letting that go while wanting to let go at the same time. And who is this person that for 20 years that I was able to covertly control that I now want to give the power to?** The sex was great Sunday night, and I took the OI route and told her to get on all fours in front of me, which she complied. I knelt down in front of her and told her to suck me, which she complied, mouth, hands and all – passionately - a complete position of dominance and submission. The next morning as she was leaving for work, she came up to me, put her arms around, **looked me in the eyes** and told me “Thank you for making me uncomfortable, you are worth it.” Of course, I said “I know I am” with a fun, cocky smile.

This is huge because my wife is not confident sexually at all. I am the only person that she has ever been with and I trained her sexually from a needy, beta cringy way, while being an out of shape pussy. Our bad sex is all my fault because she has never been able to experience the good feelings of being with someone who is high value, dominant, confident and shows genuine desire for her – that awesome polarity between the masculine and feminine. She doesn’t even know what this can look like and now I have to lead that too. She came out of the shower naked this morning and started to talking to me and I told her to stop talking and come here which she did. I held out my hand, put it under her chin, lifted her eyes to mine (confident and dominant) and told her she looks beautiful and that her body looks great, and thanked her for taking care of herself for me (which she does) then gave her a long slow kiss. She just said, “Wow, you don’t know how much I like that. Thank you”

I know – how about a little sappy romance for you guys, huh? This is where the foot stays on the pedal. What got me here will get me there - the stay plan has to be the go plan.

"f596zha","While it is true there are evil people, souls (in my belief) can very rarely be corrupted by the mind. A soul is always pure. Because i believe in past lives, it is possible that a soul can carry negative energy to the next life. If you were a bad person in a previous life, it could carry some of that guilt or baggage.

That can be relieved by meditation and prayer to your deity (be it big G or any other pantheon)

As for your family being cruel, it is something that some of us go through. Look at it as a learning experience. My family disapprove of everything about me but i try not to let it bother me.  

As for that, the best thing you can do (even if it hurts like a bitch) is confront them about it in the kindest manor you can, explain how you feel and ask them to explain why they are so angry/mean/cruel towards you. If they cant give you a valid reason, they could just be spiteful people who are toxic and MAKING you negative.

 Frequent trips to the doctor is also highly suspicious behaviour and tbh kind of confirms my suspicions about the kid.. drug seeking behaviour like malingering and faking injuries to obtain prescription drugs to abuse or trade on the streets is TEXTBOOK drug addiction stuff. 

If I were you I would drug test him immediately and possibly look into staging an intervention. With professional help if possible.

If money is an issue (due to the drug addiction/stealing/mismanagement of money, etc) there are a tonne of Resources on the computer and tv regarding interventions...

"f4kdyhh","This is all incredibly sad to read. It made me think, if they could treat kids this way, how would these people treat their spouses, friends, and people around them? When someone is upset, telling them it's trivial (trivialising their feelings and thoughts) or it's not an issue (gaslighting), not talking about it (and thus trying to invalidate them further), or hitting/shouting/neglecting/ignoring/threatening abandonment (different forms of abuse) are not ideal reactions at all. And now we have adults who do all of these things to their SO or friends, when all these people need is to be comforted and held and listened to, *even when* they are in the wrong or messed something up. It can be so simple, being compassionate, but many can't even do this simple thing.

Also, when a kid does something wrong, I've seen parents react to it in such a terrible way, humiliating the kids in public and even supporting strangers against their kid. Imagine what effects that could have on the child. What if somehow, that becomes normalised to the child? Now the child feels isolated and is fearful to voice its opinion or do anything wrong or upset its parent because in the end, children rely on their parents for their survival. The ideal way to respond is to take the child aside, maybe in a room where you can have a quiet talk with them and nobody's around, and explain to them respectfully how you think what they did is wrong. And let them voice their opinions and feelings. And comfort them and support them. How many adults can do that? I think we just learn dysfunctional ways to address our own and others' emotions and resolve conflicts at a very early age, and we just carry it all with us.",1571648011,"it can be so simple, being compassionate, but many can't even do this simple thing.","compassionate, but many","compassionate","but",TRUE,"compassionate , but many","many",NA,NA,1
"f4k89uv","Serial killers or true crime? 

My fave book of all time is Joe Cinque’s Consolation. An Australian crime - not a serial killer. 

“In October 1997 a clever young law student at ANU made a bizarre plan to murder her devoted boyfriend after a dinner party at their house. Some of the dinner guests-most of them university students-had heard rumours of the plan. Nobody warned Joe Cinque. He died one Sunday, in his own bed, of a massive dose of rohypnol and heroin. His girlfriend and her best friend were charged with murder. Helen Garner followed the trials in the ACT Supreme Court. Compassionate but unflinching, this is a book about how and why Joe Cinque died. It probes the gap between ethics and the law; examines the helplessness of the courts in the face of what we think of as 'evil'; and explores conscience, culpability, and the battered ideal of duty of care. It is a masterwork from one of Australia's greatest writers.

"f42zrtn","&gt;Jonathan Smith is an angel (who was once a man who lived on earth named Arthur Thompson,)[5] who has been stripped of his wings and is now ""on probation"", sent to Earth. He meets Mark Gordon, a retired policeman now bouncing from job to job. At first distrustful of Jonathan, Mark comes to realize his true nature and is then given a job: to assist Jonathan in helping troubled people on Earth. Jonathan and Mark are given assignments by ""The Boss"" (i.e. God), where they are required to use their humanity to help various troubled souls overcome their problems.

Only real resemblance there is that the Enterprise is given assignments by ""The Boss"" (i.e. Starfleet) and frequently rely on their humanity to help others. They're not outcast or on probation (that's more of Doctor Who's thing.)

&gt;Each episode typically begins with Jonathan and Mark arriving in a new city and assuming the identities of business employees or civil service workers. Due to Jonathan's angelic nature, the two are able to adopt positions such as police officers, medical personnel, teachers, social workers, or other skilled employees without any check of their background or verification of their employment history. This allows for a variety of identities and scenarios. Both Jonathan and Mark face the same difficulties as people on Earth trying to rectify these problems, and have little to help them after the Boss' tutorial. Jonathan has exceptional physical strength, but he only uses it for manual labor or for self-defense. At certain times Jonathan presents gifts to others, such as decorating a drab nursing home with flowers or giving someone a bicycle. These material gifts likely come from the Boss or Jonathan's superiors, but when asked, he answers only ""A friend of mine provided them"". However, in rare situations, The Boss helps the protagonists with ""The Stuff"" (i.e. divine providence).

The crew of the Enterprise is often able to insinuate themselves into situations with ease due to their superior technology, but they just as often come across peers or even superiors. ""the Boss' tutorial"" could be interpreted as the Prime Directive and how captains are required to figure it out in the field.

&gt;The series aimed to address contemporary social and emotional issues with sensitivity, and also with humor, particularly between Jonathan and Mark. Their personalities often clash (Jonathan being more sensible and compassionate but naive, and Mark being more pragmatic and cynical), but they always support each other. Jonathan's mission on Earth is to do enough good in order to regain his wings and, presumably, ascend to heaven. As Jonathan and Mark develop a close relationship and Jonathan is in better favor with his superiors, Mark is torn with himself between losing his best friend as opposed to being happy for Jonathan's reinstatement to Heaven, and considers impeding the process.[6]

It *does* try to address contemporary social and emotional issues with sensitivity, but more often by reframing them from a sci-fi perspective rather than with humor.

"f3s1i4d","Any attempt to use Magick as a shortcut is likely to cause problems.  Rather than looking at Magick as a shortcut, look at it as a way to focus and bolster your will.  Be more specific.  What you want is not fame.  What you want is more specific than that.  Is it recognition that you want?  Is it a platform that you want?  Is it the opportunity for your art or other form of expression to be appreciated?  It's very possible you don't know the answer to this question yet.  Ourselves are the most difficult thing to know.  Personally, I would advise you spend some time grappling with this desire, and trying to understand it at it's core, before moving forward with any type of magick.  When you do want to use magick, I would advise that you use it to assist in specific aims.  For example, if you want your music to be famous, use magick to help focus your willpower into writing and recording an album, or use magick to help focus your willpower into getting a manager or a record deal or self-promoting or setting up shows.  It's important that you still do the work to achieve what you want, because magick is all about will.

Also, do not fool yourself into thinking that your role is to help the maximum amount of people possible.  You can spread love and light and make people happy without being famous, and these things are more effective when done on a local, appropriate level.

"f3b4n91","Yeah, I get what you mean a great deal. I am on disability for the autism originally besides the CPTSD, I had the process happen later in life in my late twenties to around 35, it allowed me to observe what was going on more. It can be growth, sometimes, and sometimes it is very much not growth but is an unhealthy pattern. But it absolutely can be growth. Its adulthood is what it is fundamentally at its core. More guardedness, more caution or distrust, even more cynicism, their natural and not inherently unhealthy. Many survivors had an emotionally arrested development by the nature of the trauma, as a practical matter they become capable of adult functioning, but at a deeper level they were never given the tools to develop emotionally past whatever age, 8, 14, whatever, its individual to the person. For example when I started therapy 2 years ago at 36 me and the therapist relatively soon agreed my emotional development may be 12 or 13, and in 2 years I have developed emotionally to maybe 19 or 20 now. 

But in adulthood people harden to the world, because the world is itself very hard and largely requires toughening up in order to succeed in life. Not survive, one can survive with naivete and all the unhealthy trauma responses, the whole point of such things was originally to allow us to survive. A lot of time naivete is a desire to be completely seen, completely accepted, and loved unconditionally. That is largely not possible. It is possible to have a rare relationship that comes close, ones own children, or a very close and long standing friendship, or a long term romantic relationship are the typical examples. 

But it still will not be true unconditional love, it will need conditions about non abuse and reciprocity to be healthy. Learning self love, grieving that unconditional love we were truly entitled to as children, and building stronger and better relationships rather than focusing on the unconditional nature of love, that is what tends to be helpful. But the immature or child part of us often figures if only we allow ourselves to be completely seen, to accept totally and love unconditionally, to act as though we trust completely, will cause others to do the same for us. 

Usually it does not, and it can open one up to all sorts of predatory people. So eventually this natural process of maturity happens, even later in physical adulthood, happens naturally at some point, we become emotional adults, which does involve becoming less trusting and harder as a person. It absolutely can be growth if a person is working towards recovery, self improvement, and is intentional about it. We can absolutely be loving, decent, compassionate people who are open to deeper, more meaningful relationships. Mistrust and such can be used in a healthy way, when it is that is what we tend to call boundaries. 

This hardening, becoming a real full adult process does happen in most people eventually naturally. It may happen when it was supposed to in adolescence, or it may happen at 47 or whatever for some survivors, but eventually it tends to happen naturally. And that does not have to be at all healthy. We all know people like this, their really very much mature adults, just based on their actions it cannot be said their immature. Yet their angry, resentful, often mean spirited or bigoted, and fundamentally unhappy people. They very much are adults, clearly. But their not the sort of adult it is desirable to be. 

Often, I am an example, survivors only get into therapy and recovery once this deeper emotional adulting process has advanced pretty far in a negative way. That is many times a crux point for survivors, its when this natural adulting process, for good or bad, happens suicidality becomes a lot more real and dangerous. The child part of us may play with the idea of suicide constantly, take it out of its box and look at it, maybe start the process. But its normally a desire to be saved, when they succeed it tends to be an accident, their usually pretty public or half hearted attempts. This can stop being the case for adults. 

They start looking at how actually doable it is, thoughts start spinning to the reality of it, privacy and willpower in the end. That is when I and many survivors get help, at some point in middle age, I was 36 when I started. But the adult we are now, that had to happen, it can be healthy and growth based. We can have better and healthier, and fundamentally stronger and stronger relationships. We can have compassion and empathy and care, to a greater and greater degree. There are many methods of holding onto all of that in a deep way well still hardening up to the world and people in real ways that is natural to adulthood. 

The sad issue for survivors is we should have been taught and given the foundation of that healthy, happy real adult in childhood, and we were not. Its hideous and unfair, and there is a lot of work that needs to be done towards venting, validation, grieving and acceptance for it. And the other issue is survivors were not given any proper foundation for a healthy, happy real adult in the first place. Once in a blue moon a survivor may just fall into an adult group, circumstance or community that allows for their emotional growth into adulthood, but that is rare. 

Mostly survivors need therapy or a concerted effort towards self help and self improvement. Without it, and without a decent childhood or upbringing, the world does make us into adults eventually in most cases no matter what, but it does not make happy, healthy adults. That is a big part of why recovery is so vital, building that happy, loving, compassionate, but real adult, parenting ourselves in the way we sadly were not as children. Becoming toughened or less trusting can be growth for sure, a natural part of becoming an emotional adult, but to do it in a desirable way usually requires a real intentional effort for the survivor.",1570801538,"that is a big part of why recovery is so vital, building that happy, loving, compassionate, but real adult, parenting ourselves in the way we sadly were not as children.","compassionate, but real","compassionate","but",TRUE,"compassionate , but real","real",NA,NA,1

I do not know how much of a bit much you are, its often the inner critic and self invalidation, or we're not around decent people, often survivors are not nearly so much of an issue as they think, often they are a tiny bit much and are not around people who are actually kind and compassionate. But maybe your a bit much, it is possible. Its also normal, with complex trauma its incredibly normal. In that case so your a bit much, why is that bad?. I'm a bit fucking much, half the people here are a bit much at times, its simply not wrong. Not by itself, your a good and kind person. If we were looking at it in a vacuum and comparing it to entirely, perfectly healthy happy people I could agree we're tough to deal with. But for one its not at all rare, severe trauma survivors are 2 to 5 percent of the population at a minimum, and its at least half of us who cannot maintain all the time perfectly. But besides how common it is we are not comparing it to perfectly healthy, happy people, that is not society. Society has a lot of people we technically call mentally healthy who are some of the most repressed, fundamentally unhappy, deeply defensive, and often quite shitty, mean or bigoted, people out there. That is not everyone, but its sure as shit not 2 to 5 percent, its a huge chunk of all people. 

Those people we call mentally healthy seem to maintain better in a strict societal sense, except they often don't, not when they feel they have power. At least all the survivors in recovery are trying to be happier, healthier and more functional people well also being kind and decent, many who seem really pulled together or maintain a societal image of doing so are clearly not doing that at all. Often technically healthy people came at it from the top down, how can I maintain an image and boundaries, and if I feel like it and get around to it maybe I can be kind and decent. 

Many complex trauma survivors came at it from the bottom up, how can I be a good, kind, loving person, and oh I should take care of myself and get some sort of boundaries so I am not in real danger. And many supposedly mentally healthy people are deeply repressed, hippie dippie thing to say or not its accurate. You can see it, they repress their rage and their pain and their abuse and their trauma, they tell themselves they do not matter and fitting into an idea of what should be is all that does matter, and then they try to force the rest of us into that box. 

Its the internalized abuser, and quite clearly.

"f1ey2ho","&gt; Were any of your doctors women? If so, did they also have the same bias as the male doctors?

Some can be worse, believe it or not! Some are excellent and truly compassionate, but all the same there are some who think ""it wasn't so bad for me so you must be exaggerating."" (Like, ""my period cramps are mild so yours can't be as bad as you're making it seem,"" or ""I didn't need a c-section despite a breech, so I'm less inclined to perform one on you."" It may not be overt or even conscious.) Any gender of doctors are vulnerable to seeing their patients as dumb or dishonest, too. 

I still prefer a female gynecologist for comfort and shared experience, though, and for what it's worth, purely anecdotal, but of the worst *obstetric* horror stories (traumatic births) I've heard, one was a woman and all the rest were men. The one woman let a patient labor too long *because the patient didn't want an emergency cesarean* (still, she should have known better of the long-term risks a prolonged labor carries, even if the baby is not in distress). Meanwhile two separate horror stories centered around male doctors forcing vaginal deliveries on women whose bones didn't separate enough to allow it, thankfully not leading to death, but leading to broken pelvises for both women. (At least one of those women asked for a c-section when she wasn't progressing and was denied.)

But those are anecdotes and I'm sure somebody has complementary ones where you swap out the male OB with a female one. The medical establishment as a *whole* tends to diminish women's pain, especially issues specifically related to female reproductive health. Women aren't immune to this.

"f16y6nd","Let the mama bear come out. If your son is old enough, start teaching him with flashcards proper names of all relatives. 

Just so you know OP, I've told this story on here before but I'll tell it again. This same thing happened with my mom. I chose it as a hill to die on, and die on it I did. Instead of 'mom', I called my mom Marmee from the book little women from the time I read it when I was little. My mom wanted my baby to call her it too.. I told her any variation of mom was off the table. Any variation of grandma was a go. You want to be Oma? Gigi? GLAMMA? Go nuts. I am mom. 

It started with my son when I was only 14 weeks pregnant and I had just announced. She spoke to my perfectly flat stomach using Marmee in third person. I told her it made me uncomfortable and asked her to stop. She was ""joking"" and chastised me for being serious,  ""oh HONESTLY toobadiremember"". That night she brought it up in a formal of a group of my entire extended family. You guessed it, more ""joking"". When the baby was born gifts were signed from marmee, she'd refer to herself as it in third person. Sometimes when I was talking to others she'd silently mouth 'marmee' and giggle wildly as I just gave her a look of mild wtf? Oh OP, she's just teasing!!

I fought the good fight every time. I hung up on Skype mid word as soon as she 'slipped up' and referred tip herself as marmee. I didn't let my son have the manipulation gift. I had a neutral but firm pretyped text stating the boundary to send to her every time. My nephew was born and she tried to teach it to him, pit my golden child brother against me which he of course was all too happy to do.

I had serious conversations with her that turned into fights. Unlike you it sounds like, we were halfway across the country. I told her she was going to lose this battle and it was dumb to fight -I teach him to talk. All she was doing wad straining our relationship.. that for FFS I AM MOM, YOU ARE GRANDMA. She countered it made her feel included, special and loved when she hears the name. She cried. She victim martyred herself over being single and living alone - which I punted out were 1000% her choices. I told her we would have to find another way to have her feel that, because it makes me feel like committing murder. That I lived her and she would absolutely be included but Her feelings aren't more important than mine. If anything, as the actual MOM, my feelings are more important than hers especially in a postpartum scenario. Emotional support normally moved in her direction, but healing from birth it needed to move towards me. If absolutely nothing else, if you're not going to support me, do not make my life emotionally more difficult. Her emotional problems aren't my problems to solve. Find a way through life as grandma, because I'm mom.

It went on for 2 years, these arguments. Like you,  I had my second babe. The strain it caused wore on me. At the end of the day, my own mother cared more about a title than she's did about me. A ""joke"" where only one person is giggling and the other person is crying hot angry tears isn't a fucking joke. It's bullying. 

The problem with the name is it's not actually about the name. It revealed something that's a classic hallmark of my mom's narcissism - power struggles. She only sees the world in terms of submission and dominance. I could not get her to see this issue in terms of compassion and mutual respect. At one point she spit out, ""FINE. have it your way. I'll SUBMIT to you."" Like it was venom. It wasn't about that.. but it was to her. She called me ridiculous and controlling.

Our relationship broke down for other reasons, as you can imagine.

My point in telling you this OP, is once you get the mask off this argument I think you're going to find a very different problem. The dynamic fundamentally changes with the next generation, and your mom is fighting hard to keep it how it is - with her emotional problems firmly in place as #1.

There's so much good and interesting in the story (things I didn't even mention like Azura's sacrifice) but I feel like you're focusing on specific plot points that have already been beaten to death in these forums and are just a small part of the bigger picture.

Like, sure the Nohrian siblings aren't given a ton of time, but relatively speaking (in the sense that this isn't a novel, its a tactical RPG, and I think we should be comparing it to how much other FE games develop certain characters) it's still quite a bit. Sure Camilla never moves past obsessive, but Leo, Elise, and Xander (along with Flora btw) all have strong character moments before and after. I feel like a lot of your criticism here is overly harsh, again especially considering we're talking about FE of all things.

You're also misremembering the situation with Takumi. He was being mind controlled to feed Iago information. It's a weird twist, but regardless, separate from his general distrust of Corrin. He's also not the only one outside of supports who's distrustful, Saizo and to an extent Oboro and Hana are as well. I think it's just, again, too harsh to say that all that is arbitrarily not enough (in a tactical RPG of all things).

&gt;Also Corrin’s over idealism makes Don Quixote look like good. He has no moral struggle, because what he is doing is “right.” When he spares Zola or Iago, etc. it makes him look like an idiot rather than a good person. Luckily, letting evil people live has no real consequences as Corrin skips his way into Castle Krakenberg. He kills hundreds of Nohrians and has no qualms about it, but every Hoshidan he kills in Conquest is a tragedy. Birthright actually chucks morality out the window, unless it’s fighting Xander.

I don't even know how to address all this. Either I disagree (I personally don't think he looks like an idiot) or it's categorically false (he shows a lot of guilt and remorse for invading Nohr). So I'll just leave it at that, because I don't want to have to start literally pulling lines of text out of the chapters to prove anything.

I think people's real issue with Corrin is not the above (because it's not really true) but the fact that his growth is the reverse of most FE protags. The vast majority of FE Lords are already brash and strong at the beginning and learn throughout the campaign how to be more thoughtful and compassionate. Corrin is the opposite. He is already thoughtful and compassionate, but his weakness is that he's naive and non-combative. While many players just focus on how he's never morally humbled, and say he lacks growth, they miss how he instead grows out of much of his naivety and tactlessness. How he handles Iago deftly at the end shows how much he learned from trusting Zola too much. Defeating his brothers in the final stretch shows his inversion from being the useless runt of the litter in Chapter 1.

As for Garon, I don't disagree, he's a puppet. But as I said, he doesn't need to be more than that. Xander is the true culmination of Corrin's arc and growth as a character, and Anankos is the true villain (and he's handled in the DLC, which is a whole other discussion, but I do think putting the true boss behind a paywall is scummy and I'll never fully forgive IS for that)

Anyways, I hope I don't sound too rude. I do get defensive about my favourite FE game.

I will say, I did think of FE4 a lot when I wrote my previous comment. It's like, the only other FE game that explores a lot of these themes of family and abuse and loyalty, whereas the others focus mostly on politics/religion/racism (or nothing in particular *^(cough)* ^(Sacred Stones) *^(cough)**)*.",1569209460,"the vast majority of fe lords are already brash and strong at the beginning and learn throughout the campaign how to be more thoughtful and compassionate.","thoughtful and compassionate","compassionate",NA,FALSE,"more thoughtful and compassionate","thoughtful",NA,"more",0

"f12c3w5","Look, I will probably get push-back for saying this, but it has to be said. 

Yes, all sincere spiritual practices can generate some merit. Yes, this merit can help those who practice whatever religion achieve a better rebirth. That being said, one should never forget what Christianity is. I was raised ""Christmas Catholic"" and went through CCD (Catholic Sunday school) but was never confirmed. As a young adult I went back to Church, prayed the Rosary, did all that and learned about Catholicism etc. Well...I learned too much. 

&amp;#x200B;

 Now I follow Buddha-dharma and went for refuge with an authentic Tibetan Lama. So I am not speaking from ignorance when I say this. I am not trying to be mean, but just speaking about the doctrines here, not people. And the fact is this: Christianity is a death-cult dedicated to worshiping a desert devil-god and is based around sadomasochistic mythology involving ritualized cannibalism and self-hatred. Sure, the people involved in it are often good people who just don't know any better, but that is what Abrahamic religions are: False doctrines. They are childish and primitive when compared to the Holy Dharma.   


  One of the biggest problems with the way Buddhism is practiced today is that so many of us refuse to say the truth. There is all this ""Buddha and Jesus would have been friends"" nonsense that is just absurd. Lord Buddha had no problem debating and defeating false teachers. If Buddha and Jesus met, they would have debated and Lord Buddha would have vanquished him, as he did the Six Non-Buddhist teachers in the Samannaphala Sutra. Likewise, we should be kind and compassionate, but at the same time we should not hesitate to call a spade a spade and say the truth: the Dharmic paths are the truth, and Buddha-Dharma is the supreme truth.   


  Your grandmother would have achieved a favorable rebirth if she was kind and had good intentions. Perhaps she generated enough positive merit that she will be reborn into a time and place where she will accept the Dharma. She is not ""damned"" for following the wrong path. But the path of Abrahmism is indeed false. Why can't we just admit that?",1569138086,"likewise, we should be kind and compassionate, but at the same time we should not hesitate to call a spade a spade and say the truth: the dharmic paths are the truth, and buddha-dharma is the supreme truth.","kind and compassionate","compassionate",NA,FALSE,"kind and compassionate","kind",NA,NA,0

Something that is challenging: being able to shut down members who are monopolizing time, minimizing their symptoms because they dont want to disclose with the group, and since we are not a trauma-focused group, we occasionally get members who will openly disclose intense details regarding their trauma which in turn can retraumatize other members.

"f00qal2","Yep definitely same person. The best part is how they preach about how they are such a good person and kind and compassionate, but as time goes on you see this is only when it suits them. 

Mind called herself a 'mother hen', w hen she started painting me black I was like where did this girl go, She of course said 'well I stopped because XYZ'.  But if you know a real mother hen, you know they can't turn it off. 

It is all just a pretty little facade, because when stress comes or it isn't working exactly in their favor, they just vanish.

And yeah, one day she was saying how she didn't care about anything else that happened, all that was important was us, and then 3 days later she instigated an argument, refused to have any dialog, and then started splitting. 

Normal people don't have an on an off switch going from soulmates to you no longer exist.

I still think about her, but I no longer let myself have an emotional reaction to it. Our minds try so hard to hold onto the image of the woman they pretended to be, but our rational brain knows that it wasn't anything close to the truth. 

It is what it is. The good thing for us is that we held our boundaries. I wouldn't call it breaking down, I would call it standing up for yourself. Many people get hooked into this terribly abusive and belittling cycle of push and pull. But that isn't fair! 

It is GOOD you spoke up. 

And what I have found, based on my experience and yours, is if you actually hold your foot in the sand, and demand your needs and boundaries be respected equally as theirs, they run for the fucking hills. They don't want equality. They want all your emotional support, but not have to reciprocate, because it is just not convenient for them. 

They don't want you to shine a light on their abusive behavior, because that would mean taking responsibility and admitting that they are bad people who hurt people. 

Yeah, it sucks they have a mental illness, life dealt them a shitty hand, but it does not excuse them or allow them to proceed to abuse and treat other people poorly.

"ezzkufb","Imho, Harry is what makes the novels so generic.  The Chosen One? Check. Mistreated but secretly amazing and famous (and even rich)? Check. Has no knowledge\\power but is always lucky to defeat the villain because he should? Check. Not terribly good and compassionate, but is said to be exceptionally morally good? Check. Etc, etc.

I don't think it's just me who dislikes these tropes, most people in this fandom aren't teenagers anymore and want to read something different. But imho some of these tropes are easier to get rid of when Harry is not in the picture. I've seen fanfiction that subverts them, but the worst offender, the Chosen One trope, is usually still in, because that's Harry.  He's still a Mary Sue. Writing from someone else's POV would eliminate lingering tropes automatically and if there's still a fight with Voldie, the new character has to use intelligence and\\or power to defeat him.

Sure I understand that it's just me who dislikes him for these reasons, so I'm not exactly arguing. Just discussing. And it helps. Now I think that maybe I should've created a topic that asks for non-MarySue protagonist who works for everything the hard way, rather than ask for fanfiction about alternative characters.

"ezv4kzs","I finished my Blue Lions play through yesterday. Overall I give Azure Moon a 9.5/10. This one took longer partly because I was starting to feel the burnout during the early school portions and I had to play more carefully because I picked Hard mode difficulty.  On a gameplay perspective it wasn't hard, nothing wanted pull my eyes out like Crimson Flower's final map.

Like the Black Eagles and Golden Deer, the Blue lions cast are so damn likable.  Ashe,  Annette, and Mercedes are in particular so wholesome.  Out of all routes this one played out the most like a traditional Fire Emblem game, but it subverted or reconstructed the traditional tropes that go into Fire Emblem game.  The main star of this route is it's main lord, Dimitri.

Dimitri came in with a lot of hype, and after playing his route for the most part it lived up to it.  Dimitri starts off as this formal, nice lord that we're used to seeing.  &gt;!But warnings from Felix, along with little slips in Dimitri's demeanor show his much hyped darker side.  The post time skip Dimitri after immediately meeting him is great too.  Fire Emblem took the nice battle loving Lord like Chrom or Hector and put him through hell and make him truly hit rock bottom. His character development from a bloodthirsty boar, to a tempered and compassionate, but still haunted King is arguably the best character development in the game.  What I do like is that Dimitri never truly banishes his demons and his severe PTSD, but rather learns to live with it. This is reinforced with his endings with both Byleth and Marianne depending on who you decide to pair with. This anchored by one of the best voice acting in the game in Chris Hackney.  Whether it's the polite young lord, or the bloodthirsty boar, to the haunted King, Hackney voices him perfectly.!&lt;

The only thing that I really dinged on this route is that the ideals that Dimitri stands for isn't well defined in comparison to Edelgard's or Claude's.  &gt;!Edelgard had a very clear vision of the dissolution of the Church, and to create a more meritocratic, and fair system that eliminates the noble, crest based system.  Claude want reforms to the Church to have it be more accepting of outsider, and he clearly wants to bring Fodlan in line with more of the times.  Claude wishes to open Fodlan to the wider world beyond.  Dimitri's ideology is a lot less defined, with only stuff saying he wants to protect the weak from the strong, and he wants the people to live in harmony.  In comparison of how complex Edelgard and Claude's visions are, Dimitri's really pales in comparison.!&lt;  It's a minor problem in an otherwise strong story with great character development.

I think honestly if I have to rank the Lords In the Fire Emblem series, I still love Edelgard the most, with Dimitri just behind her,  with Claude in third sharing with Lucina.",1568167024,"his character development from a bloodthirsty boar, to a tempered and compassionate, but still haunted king is arguably the best character development in the game.","tempered and compassionate","compassionate",NA,FALSE,"tempered and compassionate","tempered",NA,NA,0
"ezuiwud","The California Teacher's Association is supposed to be the most influential interest group in the State, but they seem to have done nothing about worsening working conditions for teachers or teacher pay in relation to cost of living, or even dealing with the explosion of sketchy charter schools in California. I do not understand what they spend all of their union dues on. I am all for Unions, but the CTA seems to have lost their purpose.

I wish the policymakers would take into account the rights of the other 29 students in a classroom in regards to a disruptive students, especially when teachers have to clear the classroom when a student flips out and throws a tantrum.

I think schools need to take a compassionate, but firm approach. Many students need wraparound mental health and social support services to succeed in school, however we would need a lot more funding for this. On the other hand, if a student absent any mitigating circumstances chooses to impede the education of his or her classmates, they need strict accountability. Ignoring their behavior does not benefit anyone, least of all the troubled student who does not learn consequences until thy are an adult and the price is steep (arrest and prison). 

Also, Out of School Suspension really only works if a student has parents that have time to supervise the child at home and are on the same page as the school. too often suspension means a vacation for the child and is not a meaningful consequence. The only benefit is it gives their classmates a break from their disruptions, but the student themselves does not really learn anything from the consequence.",1568153214,"i think schools need to take a compassionate, but firm approach.","compassionate, but firm","compassionate","but",TRUE,"compassionate , but firm","firm",NA,NA,1
"eztr05t","I’d change my dad’s life — as much as I hate the man, but then that’s why I’d do it.

I’d give him more insight into his trauma, and his relationships with people as a result of essentially not healthily dealing with it and spreading his pain on to other people.

I’d make him want to take Lexapro, and maybe a mood stabilizer. Those have been AWESOME for me! I was diagnosed with Bipolar 2 and nothing else has worked as effectively. And when I was switched to Wellbutrin, I started to see more and more of my dad in my thoughts, actions, etc. The world was against me... And it seems that the same meds that don’t work on him (psych-wise) don’t work on ME, as he once was on Wellbutrin and got worse too.

I’d make him want to go back to, and be consistent in therapy. Therapy and my mental health treatment is SO IMPORTANT to me. It’s probably saved my life a lot in ways I don’t even know.

I want him to want family therapy — him, my mom, me, and my bf (who lives with me). I’d want him to TAKE ACCOUNTABILITY for the pain he’s caused, the role he plays in his own life (aka he is NOT and cannot pretend to be a passive participant in how his life turns out!!)

I want him to be able to foster healthy friendships with people. Do stuff with people. Get a beer, go to a movie, etc. I AM NOT HIS BUILT-IN FRIEND. His texts to me reek of possessiveness and desperation. My mom has friends. I can foster relationships with people. He has noooooobody!

All of this seems totally heartfelt and compassionate, but this is BY FAR the most *selfish* thing I can do in choosing my dad — because in changing his life to give him all of this — he’ll have a chance of fostering a relationship with me again, because I stopped “loving” him years ago.

And it’s a privilege to be MY dad, and he doesn’t realize he lost it.

"ezkaciz","I’ve been seeing my T for about a year and when I first started seeing her I was in a shit place. I’d spent 3 years backing in and out of an art degree because I just couldn’t decide what I wanted to do. I spent the summer before taking classes that sounded fun to see if anything else spoke to me but it didn’t work out. So, I decided to return to the art degree. 

It wasn’t until I saw my therapist, toward the end of the semester, that things slowly started to come together for me. I love to read and write, I love helping others, I am very empathetic and compassionate - but what could I do other than medicine or teaching? Neither of which really spoke to me?

Then, in one of my psych classes, my teacher said something and I just felt it all click into place. He said, “I know it all seems so far away to you guys right now but you will blink and suddenly you’ll be sitting across from a client in your office that you’ve been working out of for years. It takes so many sacrifices and hours to get there - bur you’ll get there and you will make a difference. It’ll go by so quick so don’t back out of this because it’s a long haul. It’ll be so worth it.”

And just like that I could picture it perfectly. Realizing this was what I want to do has been so motivating for me in recovering from my mental health issues. I initially had the same fears about coming off as crazy or her assuming I was idealizing her. I ended up telling my T about 2 months after this and she was thrilled. 

Our dynamic hasn’t changed too much, since I think our personalities already meshed, but it has tightened the bond. She sometimes dives a little deeper into her thoughts behind certain things because she knows the information is interesting to me. She knows where my strengths and weaknesses in the field will be and has used examples of how they will appear in my schooling and career if they aren’t treated or nurtured.

"ezg8d39","Two. Troughton is a brilliant actor, and he had a wonderful energy, and his duo with Jamie was my favorite Doctor/companion vibe in the show. The best way I can describe him for new Who fans who have no idea about classic at all, is that he was Matt Smith's inspiration for Eleven, bowtie and suspenders included. He's energetic and childlike and snarky at times, but he's also incredibly intelligent and often uses others' image of him as a buffoon to his advantage. Besides, how can you not love a character that the actor described as a cosmic hobo? 😋

For new Who specifically, probably a tossup between Nine and Twelve. Nine is obvious, being a compassionate but sarcastic and deeply caring man. Twelve I really didn't expect to like, but god he grew on me. His character was so angry but so compassionate and desperately optimistic. Plus Capaldi was an amazing speech-giver, and I still rewatch clips of his speeches from time to time. 

Realest answer I can give is, I have reasons to like each Doctor. Soft spots in particular for One, Six, and Eight as well, especially if you get into Big Finish audios.

"ez95h9c","First off, I'm not intimidated by academics, jargon, or complex systems. Sorry - but that's not going to work to dismiss my critique. Second, the burden is on the people proposing the tool to prove it's worked elsewhere, not on the people questioning it to disprove it. You keep asking doubters on this thread to prove the negative (prove that it doesn't work), which is technically impossible (agrumentum ad ignorantium) and manipulative, as if the burden of proof is on them rather on its most vehement proponent here (you) in the first place. 

Finally, I think even the proponents of Theory U on this thread, and you, and I all *agree* that there's a ""systemic problem"" in the way Shambhala functions. Where we (or at least *I*) differ is on the fact that the organization deserves to survive. I believe that, given the fact that its three gurus were all sexual predators, it follows that a lot of their teachings have no credit - to me, as I've argued elsewhere, it seems like so many of the Shambhala teachings (from the terma to the daily lingo so widespread in the community) work to encourage us to absorb and accept abuse (""lean into the discomfort"" and ""no mud no lotus"" and ""crazy wisdom"" and ""transmute neurosis into wisdom"" . . . I could go on for hours). Even if this represents a misunderstanding or perversion of the dharma (as I've been told by Acharyas), the fact remains that these absorptions of abuse occur. People have been hurt, raped, and worse. Children - CHILDREN - have been hurt. That's a price I'm not willing to pay. I think the whole thing should go - ""bow out"" with dignity, give assets to those who are suffering or victimized by the abuse, clean up and ""dissolve"" like they do at encampment. That would be the move that shows integrity. It would align with ethical precepts - you know, the ones on which Buddhism supposedly rests? 

The problem is that we all disagree on this. Some people disagree because, I suspect (and am very sympathetic to this) they've invested their entire careers in the credentials produced within this system, they've dragged one or even two generations of their families through the system, and because their whole worldview and immediate community is rooted in this. Admitting this might all be rotten is devastating and produces so much cognitive dissonance—not to mention the threat of non-survival—that they'd rather dig in, retrench, wait out the storm, and put effort/money into \*fixes\* such as Theory U than give up everything. I totally understand, though I do not think that the victims of Mipham's abuses most recently and those of the Regent and CT have been given the same sort of ""choice."" 

I personally would have more respect for the process if I saw money being raised for the victims, if I heard that there were acharyas and shastris stepping down to reckon with the implications of their complicity and the fact that their authorizations and credentials had been given by a predator, and if I saw humility emerging from the leadership ranks of administrators and kasung. I have seen nothing of that. Instead, I read missives from Melanie Klein and Karme Choling about putting rapists' pictures back on the walls, I hear of Scorpion Seal retreats going forth, Sun Camps—sites of sexual violence—are happening, and I see all these smart people I respected putting all their efforts into rationalizing the perpetuation of the lineage rather than toward urgent matters such as, say, the fact the world is burning down. I see harmful people listed on the Process Team, I see known predators listed on the Acharya/Shastri pages of the Shambhala website, and I know that nothing has changed and that there's no taste for change. What remains is a community filled with enablers and victims without support to leave. That's why you get people like us on the thread filled with rage and vitriol. These ""leaders"" perpetuating the system are, in short, being assholes under the guise of Buddhism. It's mindblowing. We've listened to these people—some of us literally for years and at great personal expense—sit on their lacquered chairs, telling us how to be mindful and compassionate, but now that the abuses are in the light, we see where they really stand: in support of authority for its own sake. It's truly fucked up. I've done water service for people I now know to be rapists. I listened to them teach tonglen and give vows in which they tell people to put others before self. It's absolutely maddening to see these people get exposed and then to see NOTHING HAPPENING. It feels like nothing. Sure, a couple low-level people are behind bars, but the Sakyong is literally in a million dollar home in Vermont, and he likely has a young, underpaid Kusung slinging him his low-calorie beers as we speak. Acharya Greenleaf is hosting him, and he and his wife are *known* apologists for the abuses. It's rotten. 

So yeah, maybe your Theory U is great and works (still haven't really seen a good example! and that's on you!), but it feels insulting to read about this happening while even the simple repairs suggested by the Olive Branch haven't been attended to. I have absolutely nothing riding on its success or failure at this point - I have nothing invested in Shambhala any more and have cut ties with those who do. I physically can't handle being around people willing to rationalize the abuse–it makes me feel like they don't care about what *I* endured in that community or don't believe it was bad. And, like many survivors of cult abuse, I find it hard to look away. I keep looking back—here and on the other social media forums—to find some source of relief: either someone gets locked up, or someone else speaks out, or someone steps down... and there's very little. I feel quite destitute. Sorry, but as someone recovering from being in a cult filled with jargony-bullshit, the Theory U jargony-bullshit is just enraging and reads like a whole glossary of exhausting nonsense that will do nothing more than make people who are already committed to perpetuating this dumpster fire feel better about hanging rapists on their shrineroom walls.

He was an angry nerd in the 60’s when he started, feeling as though he was owed something from his years of torment. Then, from the 70’s through the 80’s he became the Spidey we all know and love, caring and compassionate but human and driven by guilt and responsibility, yearning for a normal life. In the 90’s Spidey became really dark, brooding, and edgy, calling himself “The Spider” and calling criminals “his prey”, and beating them violently. In the early 2000s Spidey was generally back to normal character-wise, but his stories were more mystical and outlandish. Then in the late 2000’s-2010’s Spidey became much more irresponsible, with him being seen as a immature man-child that refuses to take responsibility for his actions (Dan Slott’s run, One More Day, etc.) This version sucked, and it was almost comical how antithetical Slott and Joe Quesada’s take was to Peter’s character. Now Spider-Man is just starting to go back to basics, to the 
character we knew from the 80’s!

"expiicr","I think my point on removing gender was about the fact that deep down, it doesn’t matter what gender you are. Sexual preference is really the only thing that it should define. If we took away the definitions of being a man or being a woman and just called it being a person, transitioning wouldn’t even matter. That’s just my opinion. Deep down people suffer because their definitions of themselves conflict with the definitions of the world they live in. So they try and carve out a new life and force themselves to fit in whatever way possible. I’m not just talking about trans or gay or man or woman but about happy, and productive. I’m talking about Christian or atheist or Muslim or American or whatever other label you want to talk about. Transitioning wouldn’t matter if the emphasis of whatever the label was changed to just being people. 

A person supports their family. A person can be strong willed while other people can be submissive. Some people are great at staying home and raising kids some people are great at providing for their families by working. Some people are tough and aggressive while others are gentle and compassionate. But we keep attaching attributes to gender. We keep calling clothing men’s and women’s vs the kind of persona it develops. The only exception is the power suit. Haha. 

This is just my opinion. In the end, I don’t give a shit what others want to call themselves. I’m a man second and a person first. I’ve determined the kind of person I want to be and that determines my definition of my manhood. I cry when I’m upset. Irrational and impulsive. Fearful and self conscious about my appearance. But I take confidence in my actions. I lead those who need guidance and stick up for anyone too weak to fight for themselves. I make the decisions others don’t. I pick the direction to go in when my wife is lost. I’m gentle and loving to those who are hurt. I cook, I clean and when my dogs are scared or a thunderstorm I cuddle with them on the couch and turn on animal planet to distract them. I claim to be a man solely because of the dick in my pants. I say I like women because they have vaginas and I like those when I’m having sex. That’s all I think gender should be. An easily definable way to determine if someone has the genitals you like to mash your genitals into. Past that I don’t really care for gender roles. I care about personalities, values, integrity and character. I care about people respecting people.

That's great to hear. What traits did they possess that had the greatest positive (or negative) impact on how you developed as a person in any category (career, social skills, romantic relationships, health, etc)?

&gt; I worry that chasing equality of outcome between rich and poor kids is going to be a bitter struggle if the only variable being considered is net worth.  

I agree, especially when the subject has been debated over and over and everyone still arrives at the same conclusion. Yes, wealth does afford people stability and security but it's not as significant as having engaged parents present to teach you how to be a functional person.

"ex67h71","I always like to talk about myself because I feel more comfortable talking about what I know instead of giving the cliche (however true) *""ya just need ta love yourself.""*


I was on both extreme of the spectrum of being extremely needy and extremely self reliant. I did not have a stable childhood growing up, abusive father, jealous stepmother, absent mother. By the time I moved out of my parents/guardian house, I was love starved. 

It started with one extreme where I was extremely needy. Maybe it is because of societal expectations, but I waited for a person to love me so that I can feel I am worthy of being loved so that I can love myself. Funny thing, it does not work like that. Never has, never will. All that does is give your power away (which is what I suspect you are afraid of.) If you are lucky, you will come across a non abusive partner who will always be there for you, but at some point, being your partner will become a job that nobody wants to have. Eventually, they will become suffocated by your need for validation. Worst case, you get a partner who will enjoy the power they have over you (which is power that you yourself have given away) and abuse you, be it mentally, emotionally or physically.

So, after a while, I went to the other extreme and shut myself out. This became very lonely as I did not want to let anyone in. At some point, as I was going for therapy and learned to discern friendships, cutting out the negative people and surrounding myself with positive people, I came across a really good, no nonsense kind of friend. She very bluntly told me, *""you loath yourself. In fact, your self loathing is so deep that you can barely understand why anyone would love you.""* This cut deeply, but it was true and necessary for me to hear. It was not so much what she said, but how she said it. It was in a very loving, compassionate but firm manner that made me more receptive to hearing such a bitter truth.


Around that time, I was dating a partner with a really awesome kid. I know all parents/guardians think that their kids are the most awesome, but this one truly was. I began to notice some really, really ugly feelings in myself during that time that I was too ashamed to admit and some of you may judge me for, which is why I do not talk about it, but I have come to learn that it is necessary to be emotionally authentic. There were certain things that my partner would do, which were awesome as a parent, but made me feel really jealous. As someone who came from an abusive household, it made me feel inadequate, wrong, useless, worthless, pitiful. Why could my parents not make as much effort to be with me, care for me, love me as much as my partner was with their kid? Is it because I am just inherently not worth it? I found myself wanting to monopolize my partner's time and it is then I realized that I was doing the same thing with my partner that my stepmother did with my father. That, shameful as it was, was a real turning point because it made me realize something, all the hurt, all the abuse, all the pain, all the suffering, including the abandonment that was inflicted on my by my parents and guardian were not my fault. I am not inherently unworthy. I am not inherently useless. I am not inherently damaged. Whatever pain was inflicted on me was as a result of their own unhealed, perhaps even, unaddressed pain that they had inflicted on them from their own parents or guardians.

Now I understood why my friend told me that I had a lot of self loathing, this was a result of my belief of an inherent unworthiness because of the pain that was inflicted on me by people who had not learned to deal with their own pain. It also taught me that if I do not learn how to heal and transcend my own pain, I will wittingly or unwittingly inflict pain on another.

My experiences have taught me that hurting people hurt people and healed people heal people. If you do not heal from your hurt, the hurt will find ways to come out of you and when it does, those who will feel its brunt are those closest to you, and these are mostly our loved ones, including children and partners.

The first relationship that I would advice anyone to mend is the relationship with themselves. I would also be lying of I said I managed it on my own. I did not. I went for therapy and I was lucky I got a good therapy. I am always so saddened by people who have had negative experiences with therapy because they almost always conclude that therapy does not work, when in reality, it is because there are bad therapists out there. Maybe not everyone needs therapy because there is no one size fits all when it comes to healing. You could read an inspirational novel. You could watch a movie with that one quote that will impact you. There are also many self help books out there that are helpful. Whatever works for you, I encourage you to go for it.

"ex26gd8","This wasn't in the Army.  But it certainly qualifies as a strange story. 

My battalion (a Marine Infantry BN) deployed to Afghanistan in the fall of '09.  Like many units in 08-09, we trained the whole workup for Iraq and we were diverted to Afghanistan--for those who remember that shit. 

So, about 2 months before deploying, we received this new E-5.  Keep in mind, in the 2009 Marine infantry world, you were lucky to have 2 E5s in your platoon.  The Afghan surge was weird.  Our 38-man platoon had like two E4s and and E7--the rest were junior dudes. 

Anyway, this new E5 was...off.  Not weird, just quiet, 100-meter stare, off.  He was in Fallujah.  We called him SGT Psycho as a joke, but he liked it.  He was one of those weird, balding, incoherent E5s that littered the 2008-2012 infantry landscape.  Guys who were junior in the opening stages of OIF and fucked up too much to pick up on time.  Some of you know the type.  

So, SGT Pyscho was a nice guy.  I remember drinking with him under the stairs of the barracks--you know the H-quad style with the conrete stairs?  A prime chill spot on the weekends was underneath the stairs, smoking, playing guitar, and talking.  And he would sit there with a bottle of Jack Daniels, pulling straight from the bottle.  What I liked about SGT Pyscho was he never bragged about himself--which was SO common in that generation of NCOs, and probably still is.  He just drank whiskey and talked--always interested in *you*.  *your* life.  *your* aspirations.  *your* skills. 

So anyway, the Marine version of NTC in 2009 was called Mojave Viper, or CAX, and it was in Twentynine Palms--not too far from Fort Irwin.  

SGT Pyscho came with us to CAX.  However, --and this is the weird part--every training event, and I mean every single one, he would take a Humvee, and just go drive around the desert.  

It was so odd.  Say, for example, we were just starting the exercise, and we'd be practicing machine gun drills outside the K-Span.  SGT Psycho would turn on a humvee and just leave--by himself--into the desert.  You'd watch him tear at full speed across this desert basin--no TC, no gear, just him walking up in cammies and leaving--and the PSG would shake his head and watch him.  

He did this over and over again, after a dozen ass-chewings from the CoC.  And besides that, he was an incredible Squad Leader.  He was compassionate, but strict.  Intelligent, but motivated.  Knowledgeable, but open to new ideas.  And during exercises, he commandeered Humvees and just left.  

Anyway, he got transferred out of the BN, and I had no idea what the fuck happened to him.  I often wonder about him, though.",1565963655,"he was compassionate, but strict.","compassionate, but strict","compassionate","but",TRUE,"compassionate , but strict","strict",NA,NA,1

"ew67in2","I am so so sorry about all of this. I wish I had words to express how kind this is. It means an enormous amount to me. I will try to speak all my feelings more. I actually wrote a post today, sadly I completely fucked therapy up today, there is a real chance I am done, there is no referral possible. I do not know how to express my feelings. I realized it is me. The therapist never said that, she says what you say. And I believe every word, and speak those exact words to people on here, of their value and worth and true self. But that is for others, I believe that emotionally for others as well as intellectually, but I only believe that intellectually for myself. 


So despite the therapist doing that insight based therapy I only worked on being more functional and those masks. I see what you mean about short term maybe, but I did not make the masks with an idea of time in mind, all I knew is people find me incredibly frustrating without them. That is the autism no doubt. Everyone says I am kind, if there is one thing I am is kind and compassionate. But incredibly frustrating, as I am right now. And I am so sorry for it. But that is fundamentally how I screwed therapy up. She spent over a year convincing me to trust her, that it was collaborative, that I could not do therapy wrong, and such. That the internal stuff had value. And I believe that, for others. For me to, intellectually. 

But I did not actually believe that emotionally, and only did real work on changing practically and in terms of masks. But I guess in time that bothered me, but I felt stupid, so I did not say that. I let it bottle up. I was quiet and passive of course, spoke in broad generalities, I would not be rude to anyone, but as kind as she has been I would certainly never be rude to her. But I let it bottle up, and spoke in generalities about that idea, that recovery and therapy were putting masks on and functionality, nothing more. That the meat of therapy was learning how to quit whining. She was very offended by this despite it being general, and rightly so, I was attacking all the wonderful ideas you say that she has always said. She brought up us taking a 2 or 3 month break. 

I am smart enough to know what that means. We technically have a session next week, but I am waiting for her to cancel. Her vacation is after next session, It seems really possible this is it. In terms of the stuff I wrote I find it hard. I really am very difficult and frustrating no matter how kind I am. I cannot write anything on here without it turning into a novel for one thing. But I do not know how to feel. Your so so so kind, It guts me in truth. I feel awful, and your so nice. Your a wonderful person. But I do need to hide this stuff, even on here, so long as I never lie and am supportive of others. I would ruin my ability to speak to people if I did not. 

The feelings I have do not fit in with the reasonable, healthy, kind person I strive every day to be. I have to struggle often, erase often, not to write how I am filth, shit, I am a garbage person who was broken long ago as a child by that goddamned pervert, I will never be well, the decency of people is like a knife in my gut as I know perfectly well that I am not worth it, life is pain and I long ago stopped believing it was possible to not feel pain, that if I die naturally it will only be because I never worked up the courage needed because I am a coward in the end, and I wish very much right now that I had died in the incubator I spent my first 4 months of life in from the prematurity. That is the me I mask.

As to my people preferring it that is during the 5 years before sobriety I drank, and some of that stuff came out. Anyone I figure who heard a drunk talk like that who then got sober would not encourage openness. Same as on here, the more I spoke such negativity the more I would drive people away, even here. I am honestly becoming convinced in my case the autism and CPTSD mingled in a way that will prevent healing, my negative emotions combine with a weird, narrow logic that can convince most anyone I really am unhelpable. Its truly weird, its so intense yet is not irrational as that intense emotion usually is, it drives people batty no matter how quiet I am with it, or how kind I am otherwise. 

I am doing it right now, yet you asked for honesty, and I am trying. In terms of the last 16 years, heck, that is my adulthood. I posted the large majority of my childhood trauma history on here once, it is a post about a year ago called 'This is my story. Trigger warning"", it is in my profile. The hugs truly are appreciated, it is incredibly kind of you and really does help, I do not know how to thank you. As to the psych ward, it hurt, but I did not blame any of them, it would be a lot to ask they visit in truth, my feelings are valid, but nobody can be expected to visit a psych ward, its a weird, big deal for most people. 

Everyone does know about the autism, I have been on disability for it for 20 years. I wish sometimes my people cared, some did care enough to be angry, but I have never had any other sort of people in my life, such people speaking as we do on here, therapy, social workers, all these trauma informed kindnesses, I only got into any of that when I started therapy and recovery 2 years ago when I was 36, it still all sounds odd to me. On here it actually feels pretty real and natural at this point, but this is a bubble, as is therapy and such, it has nothing to do with how people speak in my real life, and never has either as a child or adult. 

This is such a wonderful place, and your such an incredible person, it really means so much to me. I feel awful. You have been so so nice, yet I dump this hideous nonsense on you. But this is the unvarnished feelings. I do not even know how meeting new, kind, healthy people is even possible for a 38 year old autistic man on disability, 

I attend a drop in center, but everyone is very closed there, it is a quiet place to play cards and talk weather, people do not become close outside or speak of anything meaningful, it makes people anxious. Anyway I will quite whining. You have been so wonderful. I wish I had words. It breaks my heart in truth, I wish I could absorb the ideas you say better. I just hurt right now. That is the core of it, self hatred and worry and hurt. I do thank you though, being able to speak does help, your kindness really helps so much, I am okay, things will be okay. I just hope you are well yourself. I hope your okay, that life is wonderful hopefully, goodness knows you deserve goodness, and I only hope your day is such a beautiful one. :)",1565156868,"everyone says i am kind, if there is one thing i am is kind and compassionate.","kind and compassionate","compassionate",NA,FALSE,"kind and compassionate","kind",NA,NA,0
"ew2bn6e","I think the conclusion we've reached with Greirat is satisfying enough and your writing on Eygon and Irina is certainly enlightening like; I had no idea Irina even HAD ashes as I've never killed her. I love the thematic and literary parallel with Princess Rhea; incredibly apt indeed. 

However, I would actually beg to differ regarding the circumstance that led to her pilgrimage in exile. Firstly, if we were to follow the Rhea parallel, it would a curse of Undeath that was offence enough as honestly? Committing Dark miracles seems like it would make even the most adoring of people turn on her. This makes me think that the inciting event wasn't a dark corruption but a simple death. Yet afterwards, she rose once again, this is what in the Church's eyes would be the ""treachery"" as I can't imagine they'd be forgiving, even if she argued that it wasn't her fault and she didn't know; Seems like they'd view it like a lamb in sheep's clothing situation, especially given her worthy of note ""frailty"".

 The Church was now in a tight spot as they could not let her go back to her people as they'd know she bore the curse and bring shame to the Church yet neither could they stay silent and risk some sole getting curious. Instead, they decided to turn her from an abomination into a symbol. The concept of Sainthood is a special Ordination that is bestowed ONLY post-mortem and as such wouldn't make sense for a living person to have. However, if the people believed her to be dead and she was proclaimed a Saint, then she would be elevated to a level of reverence and a symbol which the Church could control, ensuring that no one snooped around her death as they could simply mark it as a defilement of a now holy figure.

 I say this all as when we speak to Irina, she says that ""in Carim, I was a Nun."" meaning that when she left, she considered herself to simply be a nun however we know from her Ashes that she was factually considered a saint and this would be a contradiction unless either Irina is lying to us (Almost impossible with her personality) or, she was made a Saint without her knowledge (I.E. In her Exile).

The people of Carim now sorted out, the Church would've had to figure out what Irina and I think you are right in thinking she was exiled to become a Firekeeper, sent out only with her Warden who served his lady but was still under the authority of the Church. I believe that Irina's exposure to Dark magic came after her journey to become a Firekeeper began. Her exposure is interesting as there are two forms of Darkness in this universe; Abyssal and Deep. We can gather that both are considered 'darkness' by the fact that both the Londor and the Deep tomes are considered 'dark'. Based on what she says about the ""biting"" little creatures, I believe she has been exposed to the Deep as per the ""insects"" described in Gnawing. 

This would be especially appropriate given that she is trapped in the Undead Settlement when we find her; A place that essentially amounts to a Farm where Hollows are raised like lambs for slaughter in the name of the Deep and it's Saint. I don't believe that Irina personally corrupted Caitha's Chime as it is ""affected by Intelligence ""whilst Irina is a woman, quite literally, of blind faith and we see she has no ability to sell anything near to Sorcery, suggesting to me that she wouldn't be able to utilise it in the first place. 

Side point regarding the Arch-Bishop; I don't believe that the Archbishop in all the item descriptions is actually alive and in control of the Church now. I say this because whilst Morne was indeed his Apostle; Morne is most likely dead. Based on the Armour description, ""Morne once served one goddess alone"". Emphasis on the **once** as we can infer this statement does not mean that he then went on to serve other Goddess given the nature of Knights of Carim and their wards but rather that in the past, Morne served one Goddess alone and this could only be considered certain if he were unable to serve another, if he was dead, for instance. I say all this to show that the Archbishop is simply a title rank and doesn't have a bearing on the influence of the person who bears the title.

Back to the main point on hand; Sadly, I don't believe that it would fully work if Irina was to have once held possession of Caitha's Chime as based on our Greirat theory, it was in Lothric before Morne arrived with Irina in the first place. However, I will make no disputes that she certainly did actively dabble in Dark magic once as per her dialogue ""I've long dealt in dark. It is my calling."" however given how we see her speak of the gods, we can assume that she came back from that brink; An ironic parallel of the Evangelist Dorhys from 'Doryhs' Gnawing'. I believe you're right in saying that Morne's promise to kill her was based around should she ever fall back into the Darkness alongside her regret of practice and hesitation in teaching the Dark.

You raise an interesting point about the Moaning Shield however I have to disagree with you on the idea that Irina and Eygon are brother and sister. Firstly, the Shield is said to bear his sister's face however we see Irina bears no resemblance to it. Furthermore, the sister is said to be Eygon's senior by several years and Irina both sounds far younger than him and has a rather youthful appearance.

If we were to assume the shield was blessed by Caitha, then we would begin to walk down a theory path that suggests Caitha herself, is actually naturally associated with Dark Miracles. The blessing (WA) of the shield causes one to attract more enemies after giving a prayer; This is almost identical to Atonement, a miracle that is designated as Dark and is intended to kill the speaker faster. 

However whilst it is possible to say that this is more to draw attention away from Irina and onto him, the implications of any other options leading to the idea that the one who gave him this gift sought to see him die faster and given that it was given when he received his Knighthood, we could presume this was by the Church. The nature of its weapon art and the fact that it's called ""deformed"" suggest to me that this was given to ensure that Eygon, and by extension, Irina would die faster which is honestly just terrifying. 

But! Back to the idea of the Dark path; The nature of moaning Shield's 'Blessing' and the fact that a chime blessed by her is attuned to darkness leads me to think that maybe whilst her followers like Morne may teach miracles in line with the Church, she herself and her divine magics are considered to be heresies; I'd back this up by pointing out that the Way of White has no problem turning against former divinity as seen by the denouncing of Allfather Lloyd, Uncle to Gwyn.

When I say this, I don't mean to say that Caitha is a dark Goddess in the same way that Nahr Alma is as I love Caitha's characterisation as caring and compassionate, but rather in the way that the Deep is not inherently evil but simply rather a religious force that simply doesn't actively support the 'good' of the Gods and their Way of White. I'd like to think that maybe Caitha she saw herself in the two outcasts, and took pity on them and guided the warden towards her Chime in Lothric's Castle, that he may give a gift unto his Lady and bring the Goddess' touch closer to her Maiden.",1565042755,"when i say this, i don't mean to say that caitha is a dark goddess in the same way that nahr alma is as i love caitha's characterisation as caring and compassionate, but rather in the way that the deep is not inherently evil but simply rather a religious force that simply doesn't actively support the 'good' of the gods and their way of white.","caring and compassionate","compassionate",NA,FALSE,"caring and compassionate","caring",NA,NA,0

"evypv36","&gt; There are many ""bad"" near death experiences too and it scares the shit out of me. Am I going to be tortured? 

Yes.  But seeking this path out is you recognizing the failures on the part of your limited individual view, and you recognizing that you must reintegrate to avoid the suffering before you.

Everyone here will be kind and compassionate, but if you know you did wrong in this life, then you will punish yourself.  You can do good, as you understand ""good"" to be,  And that will help you.  But the ""evil"" you did will still haunt you.

You will have to suffer through it at some point.  And you deserve that.  The best you can hope for is to exhaust that suffering in this life.  And if you open your mind enough to the world around you, you will be able to do exactly that.

Find a waterfall near you.  If there are no waterfalls near you, suspend a dirty bucket above your head with a small hole so the water slowly drips into a consistent place.  It must be annoying and eventually painful.

Take the lotus pose beneath the waterfall, or drip.  The water should hit your forehead, between your eyes and above slightly.   It must be hugely annoying and painful at points.  All of this is okay.  The more pain, the better.  The filthy water is covering you with impurity.  let the impurity flow around you, not into you.

Focus on visualizations of a cube.  Rotate the cube, familiarize yourself with it.  Shrink and expand it.  Have it move with your breaths.  As you breathe in it rotates clockwise and shrinks, as you breathe out it rotates counter-clockwise on a different axis and expands.  In.  Out.  In.  Out.

Focus on the point where the breath changes direction.

Try to pinpoint it.

As you try to peg this down, realize that the expansion and contraction eventually reaches a superposition of both simultaneously.  Like feathered realities fading into each other.  Try to find the exact midpoint.  

When you think you've found the midpoint, begin trying to rotate it on both midpoints.  You'll note that the ""smaller"" square and the ""larger"" square are actually the same size.  The perception of change is a limitation of only your 3D mind.  Notice as it rotates, it engulfs the other and becomes it.

Try to do the same with a sphere contained by a cube.  This all should take at least 2 hours.

If successful, you should feel immense shame and negative feelings for a few months, and you will suffer immensely.  Don't attempt to build or start anything during this time, as it is doomed to failure.  Eventually, you will move past it and will earn a better life.

"evw6frl","""Please mr. Richard, there is no need for panic. Your fear can actually make it even more dangerou- whoops, there pops another horn."" 

The distorted, nightmerish creature stood up to its full length, reaching easily over smaller houses, it's form warped and everchanging. It cried out when a new, black horn grew out from its skull, smeared in blood and lightning. 

""I say, you must have had a terrible incident with animals..."" The doctor turned to look at her patient, Mr. Richard. 37 year old bachelor, slightly overweight and starting to lose hair. But in his own world, he appeared as a small child. Typical case of a person with inferiority complex and severe nostalgia towards more innocent times. 

""Mr Richard, please understand that your state of mind affects everything here. While you are in no actual danger, it makes this session that much harder."" She pulled out her 'other work' case out of thin air, opening it while holding an eye contact with her patient. ""I can help you by weakening it, but you just have to calm down, become the master of your own world."" Her tone was calm and frank, which was the only reason Richard didn't flip out when she pulled a battle axe of his size out of the case. ""Now, if you'll excuse me...""

Lightning flashed, the monster roared, the steel of the axe glimmered and the doctor danced around the creature. One, two slices and an arm dropped to the floor. The twisted form of the beast came more clear, as the hand revealed out to be a leg of a cow or a horse. ""Hmm, not your typical source of fear, hoW INTERESTING!"" She finished her thinking out by yelling the last bit, as she stroke her axe in to the monster's skull. After the final blow, it fell over and started shrinking down, becoming more clear and apparent. 

Richard stood up and walked to the doctor. She was standing right besides the monster's corpse. ""Ah, mr. Richard, you are looking better already!"" Richard stopped and took another look at himself. His appearance had become that of a late teenager. ""That means this was a trauma to you, as a child. Do you recognize this bull?"" Richard walked beside the doctor, taking a look at the remains of the monster. Instead of a monster, there laid a big black bull, with a hole in the temple of its head.

""I- I remember, I grew up in a farm... This was Bruno... I loved this ox... One day, my father told me to come to the barn and... Put it down. I was only nine..."" Richard broke down crying, kneeling beside Bruno's corpse. ""I gather he didn't die instantly, but became enraged and started trashing about?"" Her voice was compassionate, but firm. ""How did yo-"" ""It was easy to gather, the beast didn't target you with its attacks but was just flailing around. I could also gather that it was a rainy night and your father yelled to you after the event. Oh, that was because of the lightning horn and its constant roaring at you.""

The doctor packed up her eguipment and turned to Richard once more. ""None of that was something to be ashamed of Rick. You were just a child. You couldn't have done anything about Bruno surviving that. It was just bad luck..."" She came closer and gave him a hug. Richard broke down again and embraced her back.

 ""Well, next time we will continue with where we left off. The bill will be sent in the mail and we will continue next week! I'll see you then, bye bye!"" The doctor bid her farewells with a smile.

"evw3dp1","The issue that I see with you is that you are being selfish and compassionate at the same time. You say that you are being compassionate, but then you feel bad when it's not appreciated. If it was selfless compassion (the kind of compassion you should strive for, its the kind of compassion that doesn't create suffering in you, its the kind that heals you of suffering), then you would just do it for the other person and not expect anything in return. 

It seems to me that the conflict is the issue. you do nice things, but are expecting to get things in return for it. And the world, in general, doesnt respect kindness like that. lol it sucks but yeah, being nice doesn't get you any handouts from 9 out of 10 people.

"evqdar9","Yup even the accessory have categories set to them so only certain characters can use them. There are some more generic items like the herbal ring +100 hp and 2.5% hp regen per turn that be used by everyone but for really specializing a character you would have to look through the items and see how you would want to play the character at the time. Hero will have access to swords and axes. Axes have higher damage and crit but less accuracy where as the swords could have decent damage better accuracy but weigh him down and lower agility.   


The same goes for the armors in the game as well. Some of Trixs armors will be more magical focus seeing as how she is the mage but some of them go a step further by adding some immunity to different elements but might have a down side of increased damage taken from another.   


Chicken is more of a glitch not supposed to be there character so he has essentially been given the role of Vayn who is the first character you see to die. Vayn was supposed to be the claw user/bard but since the chicken got summoned in his place he has taken on the role and made it his own. He has both magical and physical skills so his items allow you to build him whichever way you would like which would make some of his skills less useful but since he is also the bard he gets to help out his team with different buffs.  


Hero being the protector has defensive abilities to help protect everyone but he is still the hero of the story so he has good damage potential. When it comes to the game and his party Dealing damage takes a backseat to protecting others so he has a few different ways to protect them and himself but when give a free shot has access to some really powerful attacks. His heal spell will get stronger as he levels and as his allies levels because it is % based rather than a flat amount like potions. At some points in the game the items will be a more viable option and others his heal will be the better option but it makes it to where every item is still viable as well as every spell they have access to. It Makes it more situational how you use them and how you handle each fight so it puts a weird strategic approach onto the generic rpg forumla.  


Also chicken. He might have the best storyline out of any of the characters so. They consider him a hero since he was summoned and just roll with it which is awesome to me but in the end that chicken was meant to be just a standby npc in the game and so his approach to the way they deal with what the heros deal with is completely different and you will see what I mean as the game progresses. A glimpse of this is really made clear during the bit of story and dialogue thats in the second village but I think chicken will be one of the more loved characters in the game.  


I wanted to give each character their own feel. Their own identity as you play with them so you can really feel like you know who that person is and you know where there head is when it comes to certain problems. A brief description of each if I had to say it wouldlike this:   
Hero - Cocky , Heroic , Ready to put his life on the line.  
Trix - Compassionate but serious, Wise , Powerful but vulnerable  
Chicken - Confused, Misunderstood, Trying his best, Gives it his all.  


It's still really early in the game but there will be parts where you get to explore each of the 3 main characters a little more and I do plan to add in a few others kind of like kingdom hearts style where you can choose to have the extra ones with you or not While others might never get to see the games release.

"evgtk59","So I've started listening to Christy Harrison's Food Psych podcast recently (which u/wearealonetogether mentioned in the Friday rant thread), basically out of some kind of perverse curiosity. I've been listening to it on my commute so I can yell at the radio while I'm driving, haha. I'm halfway through her second guest episode with Ragen(!!!), #113 I think, and that's been a pretty hilarious trainwreck. A few thoughts:

1. I can see why Christy Harrison appeals to people. She comes across as very smart, thoughtful, and compassionate. But christ, she is SO dishonest. Either that, or incredibly incompetent. No one who claims to be knowledgeable in their field should repeat as many lies as she does in one 90-minute episode. Whether she's a true believer or a cynical charlatan, I will leave others to judge. 
2. Ragen comes across as incredibly articulate, or at least she did on this episode. If you didn't realize that basically every word out of her mouth is a lie, I could see why you'd be convinced by her spiel. I'm sort of amazed at how morally bankrupt she and Christy both are.
3. It is becoming apparent to me why these people feel the need to repeatedly and consistently deny that weight loss is impossible: they just really, really need it to be true. If it's not true, their entire house of cards falls down. The Ragen guest episode made that even clearer than usual, since Christy asked her what fat people who are experiencing health problems (e.g. knee pain, lack of mobility and flexibility, low energy levels, etc.) should do to improve their quality of life, and Ragen's solution was basically to address each of those things piecemeal (strength training! stamina training! work on flexibility!) instead of just allowing that there is in fact one solution that would probably address all of them. Because that's not a solution, see, because it never works, except when it does (but those people are ~~*disordered*~~ and therefore do not count). It makes me wonder how the entire movement will respond when medical science inevitably progresses to the point of solving obesity via a daily pill or something similar. It's such a stupid hill to die on, too, because if you believe that fat people are just as deserving of dignity and rights and access as everyone else, shouldn't you believe that *even if* weight loss is possible? If not, aren't you basically just acknowledging that it would somehow be okay to treat fat people badly if they *could* choose to be thin? Super woke, that.

It’s a shame your partner is so anti-medication, but I understand his reasons. 

Looking at it from your perspective, I feel you need to put in firm boundaries around this behaviour. Yes, I suffer from two different mental illnesses, but that doesn’t excuse me being a total dick to people. I am responsible for my own behaviour at the end of the day. If I behave in a way I can’t control at the time, all I can do is 1) acknowledge what I’ve done wrong and 2) try to make it right and apologise, learning from it.

"ev5ykh6","To be honest, my home group hasn't had issues like this in the time I've been attending. And we get a lot of New comers who become regulars. We study the traditions and concepts in addition to the steps, sponsorship, service, and have open topic meetings also. We dedicate days of the week to these certain topics while also changing things to a newcomer based topic if someone has joined us for the first time. We read crosstalk at each meeting even if it's just a few of us regulars. We value our meeting space as a safe place completely free if judgement. We also have a fellowship lunch after one of the meetings every week, assuming at least a couple people can attend. 

I'd argue we model good recovery, including setting appropriate boundaries for and within the group. We will interrupt if someone is spending too much time, is agressive and intimidating (as crosstalk includes being intimidating) and we don't do these things ourselves. If someone were threatening, I know, especially our longtime members, will address it to the person in a calm, compassionate, but firm manner. It's possible my group is unique with the members we have, there's a great diversity in age, background, and education. 

The other groups I attend are similar. Valuing and asserting crosstalk. Interrupting if appropriate. Being very respectful to stay out of each other's business. Understanding sharing in the meeting isn't a request for input, help, or response at all. 

As for gossip. Look in the indexes on 'gossip', 'obstacles to success', 'judgement', 'criticism', 'humility', and 'carrying the message' or 'let it begin with me' (under slogans).

"ev5a790","&gt;By the end of the series most of her experiences have reinforced her sense of self righteousness.

See that's the problem. When you make a mistake in life and you learn from those mistakes, then your character has shown development. In GOT Dany makes mistakes, learns from them but then repeats them like it never happened. Which is ridiculous and quite frustrating.

&gt;Tyrion explains it in the last episode she has decided that whatever she does must be right because she has done them

That's the story 2D is trying to sell us but I respectfully disagree because it makes no sense to me as she has literally been in this same situation before and should have learned from her failures. She says she wants to rule with fear knowing fully well what happened to the last guy who decided to rule with fear ugh it hurts.

&gt;She has been shown to be kind and compassionate but only to those she feels deserve it and when someone doesn't deserve it she treats them harshly as she did to the slave masters.

....I believe we're all guilty of this, just human nature.

&gt;she's gone mad because of everything that's happened to her.

To say she became mad because of everything around her is unrealistic and a disservice to her character. She loses her child, husband and brother but she's resilient enough to bounce back. She loses her 1st bestfriend and her dragons are gone yet she keeps a cool head and comes out victorious. She loses Jorah and Selmy yet she's able to keep emotions in check and marries a former slave owner to oversee diplomacy. She loses Viserion yet she shows strength and soldiers on. But when she loses Missandei and Rhagael (might i add in the dumbest way possible), she is suddenly no longer strong, no longer resilient, cool headed, emotions in check none of that. Now she is just mad because plot demands it.

&gt;She didn't kill children prior to season 8 and if she had it would have made the entire story ridiculous.

What do you mean? that would've made the story 10x more believable. Look at breaking bad for example with the exact same storyline (No spoilers) and no controversial ending. Season after season we could literally see the character's progression into darkness and criminal behavior. GoT S8 however portrays Daenerys like there has always been a darkness inside of her all along, almost like she doesn't have a choice because it is embedded in her genes. What utter nonsense. For her decision to make sense I needed to see her brush off the accidental killing of a child not punish her dragons. I needed to see her progressively abandon her morals and principals instead of being determined to be different from her cruel father literally after every conversation she has about him. We even got a scene from the breaking bad where the character finally admits that yes he started out with good intentions for his family but he continued because he ended up enjoying the darkness. Perhaps if we got all this from Dany then we would be having a very different conversation rn. Even the shots in BB were usually filmed from the characters POV just like in GOT but the cinematography always betrayed the character and told a different story.

"ev4eytc","&gt;So because I tried rescuing a homeless dog and it bit me then that is foreshawoding that I will be a dog mass murderer one day? no it's not. She locked up her Dragons to punish them for senselessly killing a human no more no less.

Well that's true but I think looking at her own decisions, especially in the case of king's landing showing mercy has resulted in her situation declining. She, as I mentioned earlier, has decided that power is more important to her than helping people and she sees the power slipping. That, combined with her anger over Missandei leaves her unable to distinguish between enemy and victim. She judged all of king's landing guilty of cersei's crimes and made them pay for it. 

&gt;she decides to compromise and try a different approach. But in S8 she goes we're taking over the world and there's no chance in hell I'm wrong because I know what's best and those who disagree can start digging their graves,

You're absolutely right that Daenerys has compromised in the past but to me that's where we can see her change.  
In the past she has been unwilling but able to admit she was wrong. She did it after crucifying the masters for example iirrc. By the end of the series most of her experiences have reinforced her sense of self righteousness. Tyrion explains it in the last episode  she has decided that whatever she does must be right because she has done them. That is in my opinion why she doubles down after destroying the city. Because she has rationalised it as a liberation rather than an extermination.

That's how she justified burning the city but it's not imo why she did it. And that relates to my point about Daenerys greatest fear.

&gt;When we watch a story we judge the characters based on their actions and their words.

Well that's what I had judged from her actions and words. Namely how she latched on to whatever gave her power and security furthermore it fits with her circumstances of being constantly in fear of her brother. I don't don't generally like to use book examples when talking about the show since they diverge so much but from my perspective the books  make it  abundantly clear that what she craves most is security and agency and what she fears most is powerlessness.

&gt;Dany has been shown to be compassionate, kind and ruthless when necessary even after she lost her brother or after Jorah's  treason.

She has been shown to be kind and compassionate but only to those she feels deserve it and when someone doesn't deserve it she treats them harshly as she did to the slave masters. Whether you think they deserved what she did is entirely irrelevant because she thinks they did so she will punish them as harshly as she sees fit. She decided that the people of King's landing deserved to burn so she burnt 'em. 

It's worth mentioning that burning KL was not inevitable.  Her burning of KL was the result of numerous factors which, had one or two happened differently she may not have burned the city. 

&gt;in S8 she's now Hitler because according to 2D that's how genetics works.

I disagree, she hasn't gone mad because of her father she's gone mad because of everything that's happened to her. Her father's madness is foreshadowing of her own madness and many parallels can be drawn between the two e.g. the paranoia that everyone is secretly your enemy. But to say she went mad just because her father did is, from my perspective, doing the writing (however flawed it may be in other areas) a serious disservice. 
In season 8 we see all of the things in her life collapsing around her and we can see these factors adding up to the eventual culmination of these events.

&gt;Before S8, she never betrayed a single soul, she never killed children, she never took pleasure from watching people burn,

She didn't kill children prior to season 8 and if she had it would have made the entire story ridiculous.

"euytssq","Amanda/Ren,

You don’t know me and I don’t know you - but I want you to know my heart goes out to you. Please take the time to read this when you can... maybe even more than once. 

I am old enough to be your mom and do have a number of chronic illnesses. I wholly understand how some days can feel like utter death and sometimes a new symptom can be very worrisome. I know that sometimes when we read another person’s struggle, we can identify with it so completely it feels like they’re describing our own experience. I know what it’s like to want answers For every odd thing that happens with your body, to need answers - even if just for peace of mind.  I promise you I understand all of these feelings. But I also know that if you dig deep, you’ll find that illness does not, in fact, define you (nor do you want it to). 

I wish I could just sit you down and explain what your life will look like if you continue on your current path. But since I can’t, I hope you’ll take these suggestions to heart - please don’t take offense, they come from a place of care and concern for your well-being. I can’t promise that you’ll find value in all (or any) of these. While some are over generalized others may be too specific in the wrong way, I hope you’ll be able to tweak something here and make it your own to add meaning to your time and joy to your life. 

(1) Close Beads of Strength. It was a kind idea and I have no doubt you made a lot of people feel supported and cared for. You’ve done your service, but it has run its course. Without donations, you aren’t able to commit to requests and your own situations have gotten in the way of properly hosting giveaways - so before IG takes you down, just make an announcement that it’s time to close and do it. 

(2) On your main IG account(s), stop following illness accounts unless you have established a personal connection with them (I don’t mean a positive comment back and forth, I mean a true friend that you’ve really connected with online). I know this seems drastic, but seeing those posts constantly in your feed has a negative impact on you. It’s not like that for everyone and may not be this way for you forever, but please try to see this in yourself right now. If you like positive quotes and messages, there are thousands of accounts that offer those without being centered around a person’s health struggles. You do not need to see what diagnoses, tests, and procedures other people are dealing with because (as mentioned above), sometimes it’s just too easy to make a connection with your own experiences - real or imagined - and seeing the feedback/support they get encourages you to make similar posts or stories. It sparks a need for validation and competition that isn’t healthy. At all. I know there are some amazing, kind, brave people behind many of those accounts, but we tend to reflect what we see. Your mental health just needs a break from them for a little while. 

(3) Also look at who’s following you. Many of these people are not your friends. I’m going to be brutally honest for a second and I promise this is a positive thing - you aren’t going to be an influencer, you will likely not ever get sponsored (getting paid for content), and there are enough advocates already for every condition you have or may have diagnosed in the future. It’s awesome because you’re off the hook! You do not need to try to grow your account, instead focus on making and viewing quality content. Use IG as a tool for inspiration and creativity and you may find your mental health improving. 

(4) Delete IG for good. I’m just kidding. But seriously, consider it. If you do find that it’s an asset to your life though, refer back to 2 and 3. 

(5) Sit down and make some measured goals with actual steps to achievement. I wouldn’t put specific time limits, but rather loose time limits - building in some cushion for bad days and life changes. So, if you want to be a pediatric nurse in the ER - are you taking the right classes for that path right now?  Is this a 5 year goal, 7, 10?  Where will you take your nursing classes/clinicals?  What other requirements will be needed?  
Crafts - these obviously bring you a lot of joy, are you able to stick with developing a skill to be able to sell finished products on Etsy?  I mean something people want to buy because they love the product, not just because they want to support you financially. Which craft skills would you like to grow and develop, and how can you do that? 

There are endless questions you can ask and answer that will help you find your direction in every aspect of your life. Write it all down. Make a brain dump page with a single goal and write down everything that pops into your mind. Then organize those thoughts, look up answers if you need to, and make a structured plan. Then on to the next goal. Repeat. 

(6). Five was hard. And time consuming. And man, it’ll keep you busy because you’ve found focus. So, how do we make time for health... especially when that should be priority one?  See 5 again. It’s time to make some health goals too, but only the things that you can control. You aren’t going to have time for health obsession with all this goal crushing you’re going to be doing, this is good. One bad symptom doesn’t have to mean a bad day. One bad day doesn’t have to mean a bad week. Etc etc. so it’s time to set some goals for living your healthiest possible lifestyle. There are countless guides online - you know the kind, 8 hours sleep at the same time every day, 20+ minutes of activity, appropriate caloric intake, all that stuff. Naturally these are examples - you may have to make some adjustments here and there but you should be trying every single day to do your best to live healthy. Nobody and no medicine can do all the things for you. It won’t always be easy. In fact, it may not ever. But it is worth it. You are 100% worth your time and energy. 

(7) When you were making all those goals up there, I hope you included financial plans. It’s time to save up!  You may not be moving out in the very near future, but there’s no reason at all you can’t start planning to. No one online knows the true extent of your medical problems, but I can swear on my life that living off of disability is not better than earning income if you have the choice. Whether it’s working part time as a customer service rep from home or pt in a business locally, the productivity and connections are good for mental health. Maybe see if there’s something related to your career path that you can do while you’re taking classes?  The possibilities are endless and businesses are becoming more and more accommodating with medical provisions. Getting out of the house would be ideal if you’re able - for you, for your relationships with your family members, and for your future. 

(8) I’ve mentioned mental health a bit. It’s the one thing you’ve got to learn to protect at all costs. Get that pad back out and start writing - strengths, weaknesses, triggers, concerns, victories, everything - be honest with yourself when it comes to weaknesses though. We all have them (life would be super boring if we didn’t) but they’re the hardest to look at, much less write down. Take all that info to your therapist/counselor and let them help you with this particular goal map. As long as you’re open and honest with them, they can and will help you manage the struggles. Seriously, be honest. Shame is the main reason many people hold back the truth, and shame has no place in personal growth. Of all the doctor’s you have ever seen, this one can be the most valuable if you go regularly. If you don’t trust them or like them or find them helpful - get another one. Dang it, this really should be number one. It’s that important. 

(9) Wake up with a fresh start in mind. Don’t waste another day if you can help it. I know that you are capable of getting so much more out of life than you are right now. Spend some special time with your grandmother while you can. Start thinking of what your life can look like 10 years from now and don’t be shy about adding a heaping ton of hope in there. Follow people online who really inspire and motivate you. If you see a quote or passage that hits you like that and you pass it along, that’s great... in theory. But do something for future Amanda every time and then you’ll be living it, not just sharing it. I don’t have a single doubt that you are kind and compassionate, but it’s time to be really strong and really brave. 

It’s time to push yourself forward. I don’t mean pushing yourself past your true physical or mental limits, just forward. Sometimes progress is uncomfortable though, so be prepared. Put your goals (and/or the steps to achieve them) somewhere you’ll see them every day. Heck, write them down every day. Whatever it takes to remember what you’re working for. It’s you, Amanda. You’re working for you. You are worth more than the life you’re currently living and all the mental gymnastics you’re performing for yourself and others. You’ve got this.",1564108262,"i don’t have a single doubt that you are kind and compassionate, but it’s time to be really strong and really brave.","kind and compassionate","compassionate",NA,FALSE,"kind and compassionate","kind",NA,NA,0

"eup34be","I'm learning more and more that our identities can be a bit fuzzy in some ways, because we gain a lot of our sense of who we are by what other people tell us about ourselves and how they treat us. We need to balance this with a strong sense of self from within, but parents will often see their children as extensions of themselves and actually be pretty codependent, deeply emotionally fused with the child. The further your mother is along that spectrum, the harder it will be for her if you become something she doesn't identify with. It's a huge cognitive stress if she sees you as a reflection of her (my mum was a bit like this, and was horribly offended when I became vegan and got my nose pierced!). The only advice I have is be compassionate but firm about your choices and boundaries. The world is (slowly) changing, more people feel marriage is outdated.

"eui1ohx","This is all good except for when it goes to an extreme and we self harm. Does it benefit others for us to starve ourselves for example? I use to do the same, and I think it’s the catalyst for the illness I had for 15 years. Poor nutrition causes damage to your immune system, especially at a young age, which then leaves us susceptible to catching illnesses and chronic disease (especially when we are hsp on top of that). 

If we truly want to benefit the world, we must care for ourselves within reason. It’s only when we are strong and healthy that we can truly benefit others. So it may be worth considering when we are being too extreme in empathic and compassionate endeavors. We may also wish to reflect on when we are too amenable to what other people want, and how that may not only harm us, but them as well. 

It’s wonderful to be compassionate, but it may be worth investigating how compassionate we are truly being when we engage in various behaviors. 

I assume you are not Buddhist, but compassion practices are really foundational to certain sects of Buddhism. There is this type of mind training called Lojong, and it teaches us not to fall into extremes. When we wish to benefit all beings, that includes ourselves. We must take as much care with ourselves as we do others. When we truly learn to love ourselves in a healthy way, that’s when we can love others in turn. (May be interesting for you to look into further if you are inclined) 

Regardless, I am certain that since you are also a creation of God, God would want you to be healthy and free from suffering as well. He cares for all beings including you OP, and gave you the freedom to have better circumstances for a reason. Maybe doing some volunteer work may also help with this?

"euhii6v","I’m so sorry you and your sisters have to/had to live in an environment like this - I grew up in one extremely similar and starved myself to the point where I was ‘hours’ away from heart failure according my team of doctors when they finally forced my parents to check me into the hospital - they didn’t think there was a problem until the doctors had to sit them down and essentially tell them it was borderline neglect. 

The most twisted part of it was that it started when I was in middle school and was never bigger than a size 2.  My parents’ criticism of others and their extreme focus on bodies still got me. But to be clear no matter what size someone is/was at any point, EDs are extremely serious and detrimental to a person’s wellbeing. 

If possible, I’d suggest reaching out to both sisters and tell them you are seriously concerned. Not one person (even my pediatrician) was able to say “eating disorder” to me over a two year period of obvious red flags (not to mention my declining physical state). I really wish someone could’ve let me know they were there for me. 

Regardless of your parents’ twisted view, many parents with children who have EDs remain in denial even when the situation becomes dire. It’s of course not on you to tackle a hugely complicated disorder, but any way you can approach your sisters from a compassionate but firm point of view is a good first step. Maybe checking in with their friends to get their take and possible help would be worth while as well (especially if contacting your parents to take action is out of the question). 

Please don’t hesitate to pm me (or anyone else reading) if you want any information about my experience in a similar environment/need help with how to approach them/anything else.

"euh53kb","&gt;So. Much. Guilt.  
&gt;  
&gt;A little backstory, my childhood was the thing psychological thrillers about serial killer origin stories were made of. My cries for intervention were ignored by my mother. At one point my third grade teacher called the authorities who visited me at school to ask questions. I didn't say a word out of fear and loyalty, but I came home at the end of the day and handed the detective's card who visited with me at school to my mother. She ripped it up in front of me and told me never to speak on it again. My mother not only knew of the abuse I was going through and did nothing about it, but willingly put me in situations knowing I would be hurt out of convenience for her. She took off when I was about 16, leaving me and my younger sister to fend for ourselves. She came back about a year later with no explanation as to where she was. At that point I had graduated high school, and moved out on my own.  
&gt;  
&gt;As adults, I have done my best to forgive her. I have gone to therapy, worked the 12 steps, done trauma processing ... everything. I did a radical forgiveness workshop where I learned to forgive both my parents - and have done my best to work through everything. My mother refuses to even acknowledge the truth or try to repair with me. Her official party line is, ""That was so long ago why can't you just move on?"" She doesn't understand my being heard, and then healing with me is what I need to move all the way on. Any time I try to speak with her about anything more surface than her clothes or what she's making for whatever holiday, I am shut down. She drinks a lot and is BEYOND MEAN when she drinks. Often saying awful, hurtful things and then claiming not to remember when I bring it up.  
&gt;  
&gt;She is judgemental about everything that I do. She doesn't like my hair and clothes, my job, anyone I date, the way that I parent my daughter, the fact that I have tattoos, the way that I speak, how loud I am, where I live, my weight ... I can go on and on. Every conversation I have with her she knocks me down in one way or another. I do my best to be kind and compassionate, but her negativity about who I am combined with my past trauma and resentment towards her and her inability to allow me space to heal, I am just done.  
&gt;  
&gt;We had a family wedding not to long ago and it was so uncomfortable. The way she treated me in front of family I hadn't seen in years was cruel. It was watching her lips curled in a sneer as she made a comment about me not having a college degree (I'm sorry I was too busy working 3 jobs at 18 to support myself to get student loan debt) that I realized ... I hate this woman. Genuinely, honestly hate her and want her out of my life.  
&gt;  
&gt;After the wedding I got home and wrote a lot, meditated a lot, and realized that I don't need this negativity in my life. I sent her a text saying I was excusing myself from her life and if she wanted to see my daughter, to work it out with my ex. Who she still has a close relationship with.  
&gt;

Careers and being a stay at home mom have nothing to do with your situation. In a relationship you just need 1 or 2 things you can do in common frequently that you both like. I may be wrong here but it seems to me you've made up your mind. While I admire your dedication to make it work a relationship is a 4 letter word, WORK, and you have to both ask yourselves if you truly love each other still like couples do and in a non passive aggressive or gas light way sit down talk and find solutions to resolve these issues. What really concerns me is that your focused more on the marriage aspect rather than if you both truly love each other still like couples do. One thing is to have sexual relationships and another thing completely different is to see each other and treat each other the way couples do. If all else fails though Therapy, medicine, one to one talking, you will ultimately have to as a last resort try an ultimatum. That means in the absolute and I mean absolute last resort you will have to give him a deadline to change or truly leave/divorce him. The problem is you have to be 100% serious when you come to this stage (and hopefully the resentment hasn't built enough if it hasn't already to the point that even if he does change its beyond repair the romantic relationship). You can't give an ultimatum and then back down because then he'll know he has you no matter what.  


Sometimes we only want to hear what we want and nobody is saying get a divorce or that it's going to come to that, but what were saying is based on your responses it's a possibility as a relationship is two way and it's becoming beyond help to help him if he is not willing to do his part. You need to sit down and talk one to one to see where the relationship stands (romatically, don't get the children involved in the conversation).",1563778068,"he's struggled with depression on and off for almost 10 years but its been gotten really bad the past few months and he has become progressively more irritable less patient and compassionate but could that stem from his untreated depression?","patient and compassionate","compassionate",NA,FALSE,"less patient and compassionate","patient",NA,"less",0

"eu9wkru","I have a relationship with my primary abuser.  She's 70 now.  My enabler, a man who I loved deeply and dearly, passed away 5 years ago.  There is never a second I don't miss him, no matter how complicated.  They were married for almost 48 years. 

And yes I get angry about it.  I get angry that he never kept me safe, that I was never the priority.  And it still hurts and always will.

My mother, my abuser, has improved her behavior dramatically. And it's taken the death of her abusers, multiple very angry confrontations, and VERY clear boundary setting.  She knows, with out a doubt, that I do not have a problem grabbing my purse and walking out forever. She knows, without a doubt, that I don't care about any will or property.  I have the one thing out of the house that I wanted.  My father's shadow box from his military retirement.  That's it.  

She knows all of this because I confronted her.  And I backed up my threats.  There have been many times of no contact.  As I am the proud mama of their only grandchild, it was a very serious consequence.  Get a grip on your shit or get the hell out.  End of story.

My Daddy.... Oh that will always be a hard one.  Multiple times, I begged him to leave her and take me.  He would take me with him for the day, doing whatever he was up to.  It was his way of keeping me out of her wrath.  Even as an adult, I confronted him many times.

I think one of the hardest aspects of growing up is realizing that the people who are meant to protect us are flawed.  My Daddy was a good man.  He was kind and gentle and compassionate.  But he was weak.  He didn't have the strength to face raising a daughter with her own issues on his own.  My mother was frequently cruel, manipulative, and verbally abusive.  But she was taught that.  It wasn't until her abusers died, when she finally knew all the way that she was safe, that the person under the scars came out. 

Slowly, with tentative careful steps, mom and I are building a relationship.  I will be spending two days next week caring for her after surgery.  And another two days two weeks later (cataracts but with medical complications.). For some reason she does well with me caring for her.  Part of it is I'm even more stubborn than she is.  But part of it is proves to her that I am a trustworthy adult.  A lot of her life didn't have those.

I did a lot of therapy.  And I mean A LOT.  Mom has had some counseling.  She finds it easier to not dig too deep.  (And with her past, it's understandable. So far beyond a lifetime movie.). We have set rules.  And they are clear and openly discussed.  We're trying.  Both of us equally for once.

Moving forward for you... I strongly recommend therapy.  And probably EMDR and regular old talk therapy.  It is totally fair to confront them.  For me the base requirement was they had to admit ownership over them hurting me.  Both of them.  Mom for abusing me.  Daddy for not getting me out.  It's going to take time to figure what boundaries you need.  Be patient with yourself.  Journal. Journal. Journal.  Use it as a daily check I with yourself.

As to any future relationship, that's up to you.  But I would only do it with clear and straight forward rules.

"etwsrb0","Mate’s book was so so so good! I chewed through that book so fast, all the while highlighting feverishly. I have no doubt I’ll re-read it too! I was really drawn in by his compassionate but detached (sounds funny but he pulled it off) viewpoint and how he so eloquently described his experiences. Also, Canada eh. 

I think there’s this misnomer, which you referenced at the beginning of your post, that this “trauma” that serves as ONE of the driving forces (it’s never just one thing) for addiction has to be abjectly awful and abhorrent and news-worthy terrifying. It doesn’t. It may be, but it doesn’t have to be. 

My point being, if it was traumatic for YOU in whatever way, then it’s trauma, no further explanation needed. Second point being, don’t compare pain, there will always be people who seem “worse,” off or “better,” off than you but that is your assessment of their lives. You don’t know the whole story, even if you know this person intimately, I’d argue there’s always more that lurks beneath.

Personal Reviews

Caffeine: Tastes great, smells great, and oohh, is it my first addiction. Not as intense as the others, but I love having it. Goes great and it can pack a punch when had after about 2-3 hours after my dosage of IR Adderall.   


Alcohol: Mildly a fan of feeling. the Not a fan of the taste, hard to find something I like.  


Nicotine: I have an Orion with a bottle of 30mg nic salt vape liquid. Simple, but effective. I enjoy the lightheadedness to it. It makes music sound a lot boosted which I love. Clouds can be fun to to blow when I'm bored. Oh and there's variety of flavors that are just great.  


Diphenhydramine: Nope, nope, nope. Once was enough and fuck that. I used to also use it to aid for sleep, but not anymore when I started using cannabis.  


Weed: There's nothing much I can complain about. I love it all. Helps with sleep, relaxing, and anxiety. Makes food taste great, makes music sound great, and oh god, do I feel more empathetic and compassionate towards people. If I had to make a minor compliant, it'd have to be making me hungry when I really don't wanna be, but even that is really negligible. Sometimes I'm just too lazy to get food.   


MDMA: Results can vary. There have been times where I loved, loved, loved the feelings, but sometimes a bad time... most likely due to the intensity. Albeit I'll need to learn my exact dosage more, but it's sorta hit or miss. Plus, it's a drug I have not had too often considering how it's still fairly new to me and I try to space it out by 3 months. I'm sure with more experience my opinion and feelings will change.  


Adderall: ADHD person here. Of course, I use it to medicate and the fact that it makes me feel normal is a huge fucking plus. Though I occasionally use it for a high and man, is it just the best. Shortest I can put it without writing a long essay is that it makes me feel physically, mentally, and emotionally uplifted. Euphoric. Music sounds amazing. I love Adderall.  


LSD: Only had one experience so far (definitely not last one) so I have anything much to say that's concrete. The experience was just long. There were good moments, but also bad moments. Music sounded nice, I also felt more empathetic and compassionate, but I also felt panic because of certain people around me having a bad time... it put me in a bad place too. Overall though, despite the bad moments... it was still a good experience. I'll definitely need to try it out before I'm able to come to a full opinion about it.",1563017484,"makes food taste great, makes music sound great, and oh god, do i feel more empathetic and compassionate towards people.","empathetic and compassionate","compassionate",NA,FALSE,"more empathetic and compassionate","empathetic",NA,"more",0
"etl8bsv","I'm sorry it took me so long to reply. I was feeling like shit, and on top of that, well, I wanted to type this on a computer, but I can't get mine to work for some reason, ugh. Thank you so much for taking the time to write such a helpful, kind and elaborated message. It was like the warm hug I desperately needed, while pointing out some tough facts I did not want to acknowledge in the most compassionate but straightforward way. Seriously, thank you.

I've just read the article on intermittent reinforcement and it is so accurate it's scary. I've even used those same terms before (love-crumbs). It sucks, and it makes me feel so stupid that I've not only inadvertently fallen into this trap again, but also thought that I was the one to blame because of my emotional baggage (I'm damaged goods after all).

I'm a gym rat, but I haven't been able to focus on that for a long time because I ended up physically exhausted during that last stint of devaluation. I even went to the doctor to get some bloodwork done because I thought there was something very wrong with me -- I wasn't able to function because I was so sleepy and deprived all the time. That is the one thing that improved since the discard -- now I feel like shit all the time, but I can notice that my energy levels are improving. Going for long strolls twice a day definitely makes me feel better, and it's helping me with getting used to finding myself in this new-old setting (the town where I grew up) again. I'll try to get serious with the gym thing once I get the most pressing issues out of the way.

I hadn't thought of the nightmares in that way. I'm really sorry about what happened to you. (You already know most of the things that I could say, so I'll just leave this here: I think that you are a wonderful human being.

I didn't know that C-PTSD was a thing. I am experiencing most, if not all of the symptoms. I have experienced dissociation before, so yeah, I'm definitely going to ask my therapist about this. 

I have read so much about narcissism during these past three weeks. And he knows what's going on (as I told you, he was the one to bring it up), but at the same time is displaying all the signature behaviours that we all are so familiar with. It's the worst thing, because he keeps on giving me hope about the future (acknowledging his wrongdoings, saying that he will fix himself) while at the same time I can see that he's not going to change. All of this while I'm still pinning for him for some reason (my own addiction, I guess). Agh.

On top of that is, of course, the long-term damage the drug abuse might have caused. I had never considered it, but now it's looking more and more grim to me. It makes me feel really sorry for him, but at the same time I'm so angry. Somehow I ended up paying the price of his poor decisions. 
My brain is all like “look, mate, it's not my fault you did all the drugs that Southern England's top dealers could provide"". He's been doing coke and weed for two decades straight and drinking the evening away every so often, and I thought I was okay with that (because I wanted to be the cool, open-minded girlfriend, and because those were his own choices after all). Turns out I'm not, and that those choices can and will definitely impact your loved one's lives. 

I am so angry, so sad, and so disappointed. 

Sorry for the nonsensical rambling. And, again, thanks a lot for lending me your ear.

"ete2jea","It's cheap tactics my man. I swear some of these docs have God complexes. Not humble, not compassionate, but stern and sanctimonious.  They seem to enjoy the act of judging you from their thrones of authority, the low-lying Gods of prescriptions. Just like in the Stanford prison experiment, in their boredom they prefer to exercise their power over helpless people than consider medical objectivity. Like you say, their actions are dictated by financial motives, much less ethics. I'd bet most of them have forgotten the Hippocratic oath. 

What a shame such great minds have been corrupted by greed and the finicky desire to keep people 'safe' by for example prescribing SSRIs as first line treatment for any mental health concern. The overprescription of SSRIs is an issue which particularly sickens me. Some reasons for this are their incentivisation by corporations (as you mentioned), disturbing lack of efficacy and tendency to cause undesirable side effects including perhaps most concerningly an increased incidence of suicidal ideation. Yet they are prescribed freely to adolescents suffering from mental health problems - the group most at risk of suicide. 

Actually GSK has been profiting heavily to this day off paroxetine, which they immediately knew was unsafe and unefficacious. (Study 329).
https://www.bmj.com/content/351/bmj.h4320 

Another example of the dumb prejudices of doctors is the overprescription of fluoroquinolone antibiotics for simple infections, which are well known to cause nerve cell toxicity in as many as half of the people whom use them. But anyway... 

I understand I am speaking in general anecdotes and I am definitely biased, but of course I can't offer much else but truthful anecdotes, and my own experiences have tainted my view of doctors in general - it's difficult to give them the benefit of the doubt and I tend to give off negative vibes if I don't see a reason to respect them.

I always thought that what set apart the good (others), from the bad (me), was their innate ability to feel for other people. That that feeling is what prevented them from hurting others. But now I see, that I was incorrect in my calculations. So that was a very valuable piece of information that you just provided. 

Also, mind you...it has taken a lot of work, to be the person I am today. I have done, shameful, shameful things in my life. I have hurt many people, and derived joy and sustenance from it. I am not proud of those things, but I have learned to accept that part of me, and work towards moving forward. It's like, I was asleep, for a great many years...and now I am awake. I am disappointed in my past self, because I feel that I am better than those things I did to others...but that is because I ""am"" better...now. I still struggle with it though.

 I have to really assess why I interact with people and who I have in my life, and what the reasons are. I try and make sure that if I have a relationship with someone, it is for the right reasons and in the right context. It can be difficult - because sometimes, I just simply don't feel like putting in the effort to nurture the relationship...because I usually don't mean it...still.

"essyrlj","I personally didn't mind that story arc, I thought it was appropriate and well done.  Fear can do some crazy things, and I think in Morgana's case it was fear, frustration, and strong negative influence by extremists.  

She found kinship and a sense of loyalty from people who influenced her to do harm for what is, at its core, a good cause.  And in the end she partially sold her soul for the cause.  They had a good cause but the combination of panic, oppression, and just generally feeling at the end of the rope drove them to value the ends over the means.  

You could see a lot of glimpses of the good in her, even later in the series, particularly with Aithusa, but she didn't know how to handle all the elements she was trying to balance and ultimately was corrupted by it.  She still was brave, courageous, impulsive and daring, and kind and compassionate, but on the wrong side.  She just found herself trying to walk a line.  She's the strongest representation in the series for the capacity for both ""good"" and ""evil"", and there are many examples over the course of the series in which characters that are good do evil things and vice versa.  And there's a focus on the knock-on effect an action can have even if you consider it one or the other, a good act with an evil result and an evil act with a good result.

Your daughter, short of any reproductive/hormone issues, etc., will have a period. That is a fact. She will need things to manage it. That is also a fact. Be the dad who isn't uncomfortable with the idea of getting those supplies for her. Starting her period doesn't mean she's becoming a woman. Please don't thrust womanhood upon your child simply because she started her period.

When she's little, wipe from front to back. When she's old enough to do it herself, teach her to wipe that way, as well. It'll likely save you a lot of trouble from UTI's in the future.

"es5h8cw","What would you define as forseeable future? Next election will probably be Biden vs Trump or Bernie vs Trump, and we can both agree there, but how can you predict next 20 years, let alone 50 years, especially given how popular AOC is with young Americans, who are going to at that pont of time be the bulk of voters.

With all due respect, but others have pointed out some really good data and trends that show more and more acceptance towards female candidates and Hillary got very close as well. I get that you are pesimistic about the future of this and that Trump getting elected let you down, but we're not talking about single chart of data here. Here are summarized points in the comment section:

u/pluralofjackinthebox pointed out ever growing global trend of female candidates, and to that we can add the fact that most conservatives already supported Le Pen in France

u/simplecountrychicken pointed out that more and more women are getting elected to the positions of power

To that I will add research by Danny Hayes that shows that there is no bias, other than perceived bias. Or at least that's what objective paramaters show. In Female vs Male election, chances are equal on both sides statisticaly (this is a results based statistic, not input based one), and women and men campagn the same, feturing same points and same personal opinions, furthermore, it shows that both candidates recieve same media coverage. The reason behind less female representation is, as mr Hayes argues, percieved bias towards women. Women beilive that they have lesser chances to win, so they run much less. Again **MvF, chances are 50/50%.** [Article](https://columbian.gwu.edu/are-female-candidates-still-running-against-gender-bias) and some selected passages:

about percieved situation:

&gt; There’s a widely held view that when women run for office they face bias from the media and discrimination from voters. They are subject to gender stereotypes. Women are perceived as warm and compassionate, but not strong, competent leaders. In politics, that naturally puts women at a disadvantage. It might force them to campaign differently than men; it might lead the media to treat them in superficial ways, like covering their appearance in ways they don’t cover men. They may be characterized as less serious or viable electoral choices. The public believes that those media biases exist and that women are less likely to win elections.

about actual situation:

&gt;  For the most part, these perceptions are wrong. We systematically looked at media coverage of 800 U.S. House races involving more than 1,500 candidates across two different election cycles from 2010-2014. It turns out that female candidates run virtually identical campaigns as men—from the issues they talk about to the language they use to the personal traits they stress. They are just as likely to be covered fairly by the media as men. Voters are just as likely to regard women as strong leaders. The bottom line is: When women run for electoral office, they are just as likely to win as men.

Meaning, women are going to be running more and more.

You can deny some of the data, but not all of it. Especially the result based 50% winrate. And finaly yes, there is some chance that there won't be a female president in next 50 years or so, simply by the way chances work.

I actually struggle with overuse of porn. And a large reason for this was growing up in a church that shamed me for my sexuality. When I first masturbated at 14, went crying to my bishop who was compassionate, but very firm in my total abstinence from a normal and healthy sexual experience. He told me that if i prayed harder and read scriptures more, I wouldn't have this (healthy) desire. My adolescent brain interpreted this as sexuality was a sin. As I became addicted, my meetings with bishop after bishop weren't for my own health, but all about my sin. It was about worthiness. This is a large reason why I left the church. I realized that porn wasn't for me because I couldn't use it in healthy ways, not because it was evil. I found people who wanted me to recover because they wanted me to be happy, healthy, and whole, not because God was angry that I was looking at people having sex online. 

If bishops were truly inspired, he would have told me what I did was normal and okay and even good. And then possibly would have sent me to a open-minded therapist who would have discovered the mounds of abuse I experienced as a child, which is why I clung to porn/masturbation to forget my traumas.

"erzween","First, let me start off by saying I'm really sorry for what happened to you and your mother. 

&gt; (Please don't try to argue that it's completely different in Western culture; I have lived for a substantial amount of time in the West and I know only the details change, the socialisation's the same.)
&gt;It's taught to us in our families by our mothers and fathers and grandparents - and everyone - and reinforced every day since birth.

But now, I am going to have to disagree with you there. You can choose not to believe me when I say this, but NO, I have never received from my parents the message that men deserve my empathy and compassion more than women. And with all due respect I think I know my familial upbringing just a bit more than anyone else on this Earth, and that did not happen. 

In fact, I'm the one who told my mother to tell her brothers to fuck off for not treating her right (she certainly did suffer from female socialization's expectations as a child, and hated it). My own *father* told my mother to tell her brothers to fuck off for not treating her right (I have my issues with my dad, but that's certainly not one of them). I was raised being told that when you have more than others, you should do your best to give back, to your measure. To be decent, respectful, compassionate, but also strong, self-preserving, individual. That I could do whatever I set my mind to, but that there was also no shame in asking for help when I needed it. Honestly, knowing the shit I went through most of my life due to bad mental health, I thank all the powers in this Universe for at least gifting me with a supportive, open-minded, progressive and loving family structure. 

&gt;(and let's be honest, all of us were liberal feminists at one time, or even ""anti-feminists"")

Which might also be why I've never been anti-feminist. I've never, ever wavered in my intellectual and emotional kinship with feminism, even in the face of some bad apples in the movement. The insanity and illogicality of gender is what first brought me to it when I was... I don't even remember now. What, 13? 14? The seeds were planted much earlier though. 'Cause my parents didn't give a shit that I loved dinosaurs and Legos, and couldn't care less about dolls. That I wanted to be a paleontologist, then an ornithologist. But school-children sure did. And I quickly decided as a kid whether I was going to cave in, or basically say ""fuck 'em"". I chose the latter, and books became my friend group. 

&gt;My empathy in future is reserved for women and girls, who need it and don't get it anywhere

And I respect that. I hope that choice brings you happiness and peace. But just as I told my mother that one doesn't owe family members love just by virtue of sharing DNA, I don't owe a random woman my emotional energy just by virtue of her sharing my sex. I will always try to exercise empathy and compassion on general principal, but my main criterion for selectively allocating it can never simply be sex for me.

"erv3ow9","Your girlfriend sounds young. This is a general observation on my part from what I've seen from fellow ladies as they ""grow up"", but a good handful do not know how to be firm when it comes to ""the guy friend who is being inappropriate."" Quite a few of my friends (and myself when I was younger) didn't know how to tell a guy to fk off because we were afraid of being ""the bad guy"" or jerk to someone who we were maybe misconstruing intentions with. There's something to be said for experience. 

I honestly do not believe your girlfriend means any harm, and I will caution you to not inject your previous history of being cheated on into this situation. She's been doing her part to the best of her experience and conscience has told her, and that is she has thrown out you as her safety net. This is something as a young lady she probably thinks will settle the matter. ""I have told him I have a boyfriend so he won't do anything."" This is where experience kicks in and says otherwise, but do not berate her for believing men aren't the ravenous creatures they sometimes can be. 

I would honestly be very calm, and very compassionate but point out exactly what this guy is doing. Not in an accusatory way, but simply be factual: 

1. No one who respects her, or her relationship would want her to call him ""babe"". Seriously. 
2. It sounds like every interaction he has with her has nothing to do with her or her well being, but to inject ideas about him into her life.
3. He's literally doing the ""nice guy"" thing. FaceTime? ""Terms of endearment?"" No. He's preying on her kindness. Literally. 

This is also going to sound harsh, but it sounds like the reason she didn't tell you about the babe thing is because she knew you wouldn't react well. There's a line between obviously not trusting him and obviously not trusting her, and it sounds like you have blurred this line in the past. If she thinks your first reaction will be not to trust her, she will hide things from you. Not saying it's right, but you're going to train that sort of kneejerk reaction. 

Be her safe place, the place where she feels respected. She's not the same girl who cheated on you in the past, so do not treat her as such. But you do need to let her know that this ""friend"" does not respect her, he does not actually care for her. If he did, he wouldn't do things that make her uncomfortable and he would have backed off when she used you as the safety net.",1561305531,"i would honestly be very calm, and very compassionate but point out exactly what this guy is doing.","compassionate but point","compassionate","but",FALSE,"very calm , and very compassionate","calm","very","very",0

"ermo277","right, let’s address this piecemeal - 
1) looking up payscales.
...you commented this to a post with a payscale link for NYC in it.
With a separate point that explicitly noted a payscale in Massachusetts requiring a PhD and 20 years experience.

2) bachelors and eligibility
In many states you’re actually required to have a master’s.  Which got pointed out in the post prior to the one you commented on, AND the ones following it, AND was acknowledged within this same comment.

Many other professions require an advanced degree.  But how many structural engineers do we need? Certainly not 100 per town, which is often how many we need for teachers.  It’s an extremely common job.

As you pointed out (and I pointed out in the comment that spawned this one, so we clearly agree), being a teacher is largely dispositional.  A teacher needs to be patient, be fair in discipline and relatively impartial, they need to have good communication skills, they need to be compassionate but also strict enough not to get walked over by the students.

None of which are skills you learn in college.  My point is that teachers aren’t paid enough, when they’re starting, to allow them to pay off their current educational requirements.  Their wage is too low.  But because they work in a union, the longer they stick around, the harder they are to get rid of and the more they are paid.  This eventually results in them being paid more than is reasonable on a simple supply-demand question - there are plenty of younger teachers willing to replace older teachers for lower pay.  The difficulty is union establishment often means they can’t. And while I am totally down with loyalty to an employee, and I want teachers to be able to establish a steady life, doing so at a continuously higher, non-competitive rate that they can’t be fired from as long as they are performing adequately is not the way to do it.

Either we need to lower the top end of the payscale and reduce the educational requirements so that planning on becoming a teacher doesn’t put you in 17 metric fucktons of student debt, or we need to pay teachers more.  I’m suggesting that the former, not the latter, is a better plan, because many districts already can barely afford their teachers or can’t afford enough (though this is generally the poorer districts with shitty payscales).

I disagree that it’s “sad” that teachers don’t need to be as qualified as civil engineers, lawyers, or doctors.  Passing on knowledge is literally how our civilization developed.  If a teacher fucks up, a kid is angry for a few days.  If a civil engineer fucks up, thousands of people could die.  So it makes a bit more sense that we expect our engineers to be REALLY CLOSELY qualified (which is why civil and electrical engineers have licensing exams, but computer engineers don’t - although arguably this is simply because regulation hasn’t caught up to them yet).  

If, as you and I agree, teaching is primarily dispositional, then requiring a Master’s to do it is entirely senseless.  You don’t need to be a PhD to teach a kid how to read.

You assume I lack knowledge regarding this topic.  I do not.  I have served in a classroom for about two months as a substitute teacher.  The pay is absolute garbage, the work is difficult. 
My girlfriend assisted with AmeriCorps in a behavioral school - where all the edge cases for the entire district of Boston for a year were sent.  Possibly one of the worst elementary schools in the state to teach in.  I heard horror stories for that whole year.
I have been part of working groups to discuss potential reform options with sitting national Senators, inclusive of the varying constituency playing on each side of any policy.  I have met with think tank representatives and worked under a state senator as an intern who wanted me to summarize the options and political landscape of the options for potential reform within his district and the state.  I have taken entire courses of the economics of human capital and on education while in college.  I have had lunch with some of the preeminent researchers on this topic in the Northeast to talk about various sides of potential solutions.  I know damn close to every political side of this.

So, no, I am not making assumptions.  I agree with you that I would not survive teaching.  I do not have the disposition to deal with the little monsters.  But please don’t make any assumptions of me.

DC is the highest state for average teacher’s starting salary.  ‘17-18 it was $55,209, here is your source for that.  Last time I looked it up was in ‘17 when we had ‘15-16 data.  My apologies for misquoting by 2,000 off the top of my head.

 http://www.nea.org/home/2017-2018-average-starting-teacher-salary.html

And lastly, no, when I say I’m interested in it, it is because I find it to be the most important portion of federal, state and municipal expenditure, period.  Education is the future of our children and by extension our country, and I am concerned over how we are not shifting rapidly in comparison to a very rapidly changing economy, society, and geopolitical landscape.

"erkcqym","Gaia is in a lot of lore.  Most of my research has been around her role in Greek and earlier mythology, due to my secondary ties with one of her daughters, Hekate.  Gaia is the Earth Mother, and has many forms in pretty much all cultures universally.  She is the Ultimate Mom, and, in greek lore, mothered the Titans.  She is very loving, very compassionate, but also stern and set in her ways.  She will punish you for going astray, and reward you for doing well.  She forgives more readily than my other deities, and is always available for comfort and soul nurturing.  She most certainly wants what is best for us.  Her advice is never wrong, and comes from a deep place of wisdom and an understanding of natural balance.  As such she is more a Goddess of neutrality to me than of light or darkness.  She understands that we need both to be whole.  This page has a lot of information that resonates with my personal understanding of her: https://greekgodsandgoddesses.net/goddesses/gaea/

She accepts pretty much any offering of nature - flowers, leaves, feathers, bones, rain water, rich soil.  Just make sure you are using plants and animals that are not tainted by a harsh or confusing death (if you find one of these spirits, a quick prayer to Gaia often immediately resolves the negative, pulsing energies around them, as she takes them into her arms - I still don't use them as offerings even after she has purified them).  Even just spending time with her, singing or sharing your spirit, is something she will accept as an offering.  I keep geodes and other ""hidden secret"" stones on my altar to represent her energy.  If you can, going out into nature to find a stone basin (a stone with an indentation smoothed into it by the elements, large enough to hold water), I would do so.  I have felt much stronger resonance with her energy while using these types of basins.  They will even ""drink"" or soak up my water offerings from time to time.  I bury my offerings beneath a tree that I use as an outdoor altar.  

Hekate is also badly aspected in some lore.  I think this is because she is, well, very harsh to those who fail her.  She does not approve of those who step off the path she has illuminated for them in the ways her mother does.  Perhaps Asmodeus is equally severe to those who do not do as he asks.  :P  Lots of students come to fear the smack of the switch instead of learning from it.",1560960557,"she is very loving, very compassionate, but also stern and set in her ways.","compassionate, but also","compassionate","but",TRUE,"very compassionate , but also stern","stern","very","also",1
"erjydun","In general people will not go far in this on their own, because the habit of protecting your identity and persona (your public face) runs very deep and strong. Left to their own devices, most people soon fall back on automatic, self-serving behaviors like hiding character flaws from themselves and others.

But there are times in life when a window of awareness opens, and you see what needs to be done. That is when you need to set things in motion to help you maintain your commitment. These supportive things may include conscious personal intentions, written commitments to yourself, daily routines (like setting side time for meditation or other shadow work)... and more significantly, regular external guidance and feedback from teachers, mentors, counselors and peers -- to keep you accountable to something beyond your own whim -- and monetary and time commitments to a process like therapy, counseling, a group practice modality that works with the shadow, guided spiritual practice, or other such structure.

If, when the window is open, you don't put something in place to keep you aware and honest, you will almost inevitably fall back into old habits and views. That's why it's called *the shadow* after all, because it's what lives in the darkness, outside of our awareness. It's what is so disowned, so rejected, that it controls us from beyond our conscious knowledge. So by the very nature of shadow, a person is ill-prepared to clear it away by themselves.

But there are some methods that can be practiced if you are sufficiently motivated. One good start is to ask people what they see. Invite people, especially friends and family, to comment -- in the spirit of compassion and awakening -- on your flaws and habits. (Be discerning with your invitations. You don't need to open yourself to criticism from those who don't care about you!) Others will often see parts of you that you regularly deny,  disown, and ignore.

It can also be enjoyable to practice a modality that engages in embodiment or archetype work/play. In these kinds of practices, you encounter and take on *all* kinds of characters, *all* kinds of personae, including the ones you habitually suppress or disown. Eventually the details of you shadow start to come clear, and to begin the work of giving recognition and voice to the buried parts.

Mask work, clowning, movement modalities like 5Rhythms or Open Floor, playback theatre, journaling, and art therapy, among many others, are examples of practices that can both reveal and begin to own the shadow. The shadow then moves into the light of consciousness and becomes wisdom.

Perhaps the most fundamental and long-standing method of addressing shadow is meditative spiritual training: training in meditation, along with teachings and teaching situations given by a clear teacher/master.

True meditation means applying your awareness openly, without picking and choosing. In the source of that awareness the shadow gradually comes to light.

And spiritual guidance includes commitment to situations that press upon your self-centered habits and thus highlight your habitual grasping, avoidance, aggression, ignorance, and so on. You instance, committing to group practice means that you will regularly be in situations where you don't get to have things your favorite way. Then your knee-jerk, unconscious reactions and opinions begin to emerge. In the context of mindfulness, you then have a far better chance to see these habits and let them go.

This is how the situations of spiritual training transform the character. Some spiritual teachers are more piercing, others are more nurturing. Sensitive constitutions may do better with the latter type, while stubborn egos or adventurous characters may do better with the constant challenges from a compassionate but fiery teacher.

Many forms of Buddhist, Hindu, Taoist, other Yogic, and some shamanic paths can offer this kind shadow-transforming structure.

You may be interested in the shadow work of Debbie Ford, and also the field of Spiritual Bypassing (see John Wellwood, Robert Masters, and Myles Neale).

.

It is usually a very good policy to go slow and grow gradually and consistently, rather than biting off more than you can chew and rejecting the whole idea of looking into shadow. *Overdoing* is one of the ego's strategies, to keep you from getting serious about shining the light on yourself and overturning false identities.

One way to taper in is to start noticing the things and people that always tend to annoy you. Almost inevitably, these point to material that you are not accepting in yourself, but projecting onto others.

But then it's very good to have some kind of practice to then embrace and own (integrate) the shadow parts which you notice. This is where the lighthearted quality of clowning or psychodrama, or the embodied quality of movement practice, or the compassion and equanimity of authentic meditative training can be invaluable. These quantities help digest material that could otherwise threaten to linger and become heavy. In the same vein, it is difficult to overestimate the joyful, living, and stabilizing effects of a spiritual master (or admittedly of some rare, special therapists or mentors).",1560950644,"sensitive constitutions may do better with the latter type, while stubborn egos or adventurous characters may do better with the constant challenges from a compassionate but fiery teacher.","compassionate but fiery","compassionate","but",FALSE,"compassionate but fiery","fiery",NA,NA,1

"er5ui4y","I'm a fan because its the ultimate fantasy. It basically sums up everything I want out of life. Absolute freedom. You can go wherever you want when ever you want to making many amazing friends along the way.

Then there's the Doctor. Probably the only character ever that I would even consider a role model. He's a male (until recently) hero that doesn't rely on violence. He uses his mind to solve problems unlike so many other male heroes that just punch their way out of everything (To be fair Capaldi did exactly that in Heaven Sent so nevermind). He's a man of principal who just wants peace. He's not a superhero he's just an aimless drifter passing through and helping out where he can. That's what I often dislike about the times where they try and make the Doctor out to be some God rather than just a good man trying to do whats right.

Basically, The Doctor is everything I aspire to be. Intelligent, kind, merciful, caring and compassionate but also protective, fierce, larger than life, confident and powerful. A man who sometimes does what needs to be done. The whole regeneration aspect also makes it that much better. The Doctor is not one man. You can put yourself in his shoes because he has no set personality or appearance. In a few words anyone can be the Doctor.

I also love the constantly changing aspect of the show. Its like real life. Nothing stays the same. Nothing lasts forever but it teaches you that change is a good thing. That you have to keep moving when the whole world is changing around you.

Finally, I love how broad it is. You get so many shows that are just the same over and over. Crime dramas are just catching serial killers. Sitcoms are just sitting around a house. The Walking dead is just zombies and war. But Doctor Who can be literally anything. There's no limit and that's why I think the show has been going for so long.

They can have small historical dramas, they can have insane AI's. They can do dystopian post apocalyptic futures. They can do murder mysteries. They can do revolutions. They can do small personal stories based on one persons struggle or giant end the universe plots. They can do horror, they can do adventure, they can do romance, drama, action, war, tragedies, comedies. It can be dark, it can be emotional, it can be gritty and serious, it can be lighthearted and fun. Doctor Who is completely unlimited in what it can do.

My dad is standing at the edge of the FOG right now - when we talk, he tries to defend her and enable her, but he's not pushing it. And as soon as I confront him with truth, he stops. He has asked me to try to smooth things over, but hasn't once demanded it, and has backed down when I tell him no. I'm trying to be compassionate but firm with him - just as I have been abused by this woman, so has he. She has spent at least 20 years telling him that he's a selfish, terrible husband because of one mistake he made. She is still holding that mistake over his head, and he's very beaten down. He also finally saw a lawyer last week, and was told that he would owe 50% of his paycheck in alimony if they divorced, so I think he's trying to figure out where the fuck to go from here.

The answer is to cultivate an acceptance of these feelings being there, and not instantly jumping in to satisfy them.

We think we need to act on them because we see them as “self”. We think “we” want that, so we have to do something about it.

When a lustful thought arises, ask yourself: what would you do if a friend was a recovering addict, saying something similar to your thought? You’d probably remind him of his commitment to stop, maybe try to distract him with something else, or just be there with him while he’s whining, offering him some comfort but not doing anything to “fix” it.

"eq03jho","This is a tough one - I worked with a league that had some similar issues where multiple times during each practice we would have to stop to assist a skater who seemed to injure herself constantly.  At one practice it was maybe 3 times we had to stop for at least 10 minutes to address her - that's 30 minutes out of a two hour practice that folks couldn't skate, and they were understandably upset that she insisted on skating despite this limitation.  We asked that she not continue to scrimmage and asked that she sit out of the next game, as it would be wrong to put her in a situation where an injury could be exacerbated.  

Coaching may need to decide to bring up to her that her trajectory is not working, and that she has to learn proper skills to avoid injury.  Also suggest cross-training to build up her resistance to injury, but if her injuries are stemming from an unwillingness to learn proper form and perform skills properly then she has to adjust.  I'm not sure how you can word this but it is always a good idea to have coaching and skater relations involved, be kind and compassionate but firm.

"eprl6qk","I guess for me if therapy for BPD is going to be harsh and blunt in relation to how therapy is normally conducted in regards to empathy, validation, and compassion, that has to work both ways. There are therapies for BPD that can be more compassionate, but more blunt therapy have helped many people. I have autism and CPTSD that for the 4 years I was drinking before sobriety had a BPD presentation, and well my therapy is more relational I have had blunt workers of other sorts. 

Neither side has a right to be abusive or cruel or anything like that of course. But if its going to be blunt you have to be able to speak up about being hurt by that. I can see how therapy in general can help BPD without it, but I cannot see how blunt therapy can work without the therapist being able and willing to work with the transference and countertransference. Harder, rougher therapy that is top down pushing the client from above without that reciprocity is simply dangerous for BPD. 

Maybe you feel worse and worse until you blow up in an unacceptable way, or hurt yourself and end up in hospital. Maybe you take it completely, but delivered in a tough minded way from the top down will inevitably make a person with BPD dependent if they accept it, its hard to see how it wouldn't, which makes whenever it inevitably ends dangerous. Personally I prefer social workers and an addiction counselor that are a bit tougher and more solution focused, and a therapist that is more relational and insight focused. But harder solution focused has helped people with BPD. I don't see how it can help without you being able to speak up though, a real ability on the therapists part to deal with the transference. You may benefit from receiving the skills in this way.

3. Hell &amp; heaven are not permanent.
 When time runs out you will sent back from there. Jist understand if a person killed 1 another person then he would get sent to hell for a period of time until his punishment are done and mass murderer will stay for long time, permanent hell concept would just doesn't make sense because it makes us god as not compassionate but in sikhi he is merciful and compassionate enough for everyone whether they are atheist or religious.

4. Sikh can cut their hair but khalsa can not because they have to follow    &amp; work towards their goal of god relaxation /self realization by being detached from fashion and other things and respect body as whatever way it is made so that it can connect us with natural order of universe easily and our saints in india has alwaws gave priority for hairs and hair helps to activate you in mediation and it attarcts more positive energy too. 

5. Both men &amp; women wear turban and head covering is mentioned and many women's used to cover their head with scarf too.

6.

Fasting or  doing ritual,  is not helpful at all cuz that is only thing which you are doing for your body but it won't help you at all when you have to leave this body in time of death so it is all rituals things and only medidating on name of god and with devotion in your heart can help you all other things are just a temporary thing and body is given for temporary period of time

8b. In many lives you were incarnated into different bodies from worms, some other animals and then since we all wanted to get higher level of conciousness and then you achieved human body after a long time of different inacration and human body is precious because only humans have brain which csn understand about reality of god and can do thing ehich can help them to merge with the god since everyone has come from him so we can merge in him and this is our last chance and by meditating on lord name with love and devotion in oyr heart then we can feel his bliss from him and which is not possible for other animals brain. 


9. We don't belive in forcing others to stay or blocking them from leaving. 

10. You can read sri guru granth sahib ji by yourself top but if you don't understand something then you can come and talk with us too. 

11. We don't have dress  code but it's recommended to wear modest dresses of any colors or any traditions. 


12. Beliving in all the 10 gurus and beliving sri guru granth sahib ji as your guru which can guide you towards the self realization /god relazation on your spritual journey of your inner self.

"ep6jg84","I sympathise with you.  I had my second cervical screening today and I am feeling so violated and humiliated right now and I can't stop thinking about it even 10 hours later. 
During my first cervical screening the nurse had to use the smaller speculum and voila cervix was in view. In today's screening I was horrified observing the nurse's attempt to 'invade' and more so I was sweating trying to bear the pain from removing the speculum 5 times. 
She was sweet kind and compassionate but I don't know if she had performed many cervical screenings in her career. 
Initially she told me to undress below the waist and lay on the medical bed with nothing to cover . Nothing. There was no stirrups so I had to spread my knees in the well known 'frog position'. First speculum in, she couldn't see anything, she removes the speculum and then in again. Getting a bit nervous I assume, she removed it again and took the longer one. 2nd speculum in, nothing, she said I have a tilted uterus so I needed to place my hands under my bum . She kept turning the speculum and I was sweating in pain.  At this point I wanted it over, but while she was removing the second speculum she said that I needed to lay on my side holding my knees as close to my chest as possible. First speculum in again, nothing. .   At this point she has already apologised 100 times. At the end I think she lost her patience but after changing back to the 2nd speculum she finally managed to see my cervix . After finishing with my appointment I had to cancel all of my commitments so I can go home and calm down.  Since  morning I am covering my duvet trying to forget about it.  

My story is not the norm when it comes to cervical screening  but it's not all roses as well.

Murray, however, seems okay crossing that line if he feels compelled.  


I think your question highlights an old left/right divide; can government fix social problems? I’m hard pressed to think of many social problems the government has fixed, so I always skeptical about attempts.  In this case, I don’t think there is a clear enough solution for them to try. I see almost every initiative as being at least as harmful as it is helpful.  


The government has been very effective and stopping unequal treatment in the past, and, therefore, I support most initiatives that look to stop active wrong doings. 



So, what should the government do? I think it should stay about the fray. Avoid policy that uses race as a consideration.  Actively seek out and dismantle illegal or prejudicial practices.  But the government must stay away from theoretical wrong doings. In otherwords, because Asians are the most prominent race is universities does not necessarily mean there is some bias toward them. Same with Black peoples in prison or white people and opioid overdoses.  These are trends that exist but there is no solid evidence of any causation.  Therefore, to act on speculation as to the cause is unethical, and if that speculation is wrong it could be catastrophic.  


I don’t think this is pretending that people are colorblind.  I think it is just the sobering realization that the government cannot legislate the minds and hearts of people.  But they can further deepen racial divides and emphasis racial identities by continuing to evaluate citizens on the base of their race.  Humans are tribal biologically, and encouraging it will only cause harm.  It will be many years before this we know the full story of this whole Trump debacle, but I suspect that the disenfranchisement of the religious white rural people will be one of primary causes.  


In the end, I think people want to help. I think typically humans are decent and compassionate, but I think those qualities diminish when people become part of a crowd, or when people start considering another human as part of a crowd, rather than considering them as an individual.  The left see it possible to make good change on a macro level, but history has no examples of this working.  I would love if it did, but I know no examples of society following politics. It is always the other way around. And the more our politics emphasis our racial identities the less we will view each other as individuals and the more we will see each other as a member of a group whose characteristics are determined by a series of data points and trends.  


In short, the fix to this problem will occur over generations, as people befriend and marry each other, bringing down the walls between cultures and races.  The government being involved will only delay that, but strengthening those walls.",1558895225,"i think typically humans are decent and compassionate, but i think those qualities diminish when people become part of a crowd, or when people start considering another human as part of a crowd, rather than considering them as an individual.","decent and compassionate","compassionate",NA,FALSE,"decent and compassionate","decent",NA,NA,0

"eosomsc","Well don’t take her to any more horse shows then simple as that. She may have a disability too in that you have to be compassionate but straightforward. But social skills isn’t something you can’t teach since it’s just something that you learn with time and experience. Still if she is eager to learn and is a hard worker then that’s the half of the job already done. She also seems to show up on time and the horses love her which is important since a animal can sense if a person doesn’t like them or not. 

Regardless she seems to be great in every other sense it’s just that’s she doesn’t think before she speaks. But oh well this problem seems to only occur when is she invited to attend these shows which seems to be in a professional setting. So the solution would be to stop taking her with you to these shows but instead put her in more of a informal setting where she may flourish. This has been already been proven in the way she has taken care of the horses in the stable. Yet she could still feed and take care of the horses since these are duties that will always need to be performed regardless if the horse is competing in a show or not am I right?

 Plus where I live there is a organisation called riding for the disabled where people with a wide array of disabilities are able to ride horses. This alone has proven really beneficial for them and it is very likely that she has disability but then she is only volunteering. She is not a paid employee so your actually gaining a lot since your basically receiving free labour in return of helping somebody feel great about themselves. However I know the comment she made about the paste would of made a lot of bystanders question what you were actually given to your horses. Still nothing happened there were NO consequences at all. The best thing to do is to move forward and remove her from all of these suituations that may arise in the future.

"eogoxci","Props for writing this out and you're absolutely right.  


But I think that what you just described shows perfectly why Ran is not liked as much as other characters of the show. The main reason why so many started to doubt ShinRan is for one, that Ran's to perfect. As you said, she is fierce and compassionate, but also kind and calm. She will kick your ass, just because you have angered her, but is ready to forgive a lot. She is smart yet naive, strong willed yet depended on her friends and above all, she's never doubts.

As you might have noticed from this list, she has all those really contradiction traits and exactly this makes her seem bland. With a perfect character, you can deliver a message or use him as a model for your protagonist to follow, but they are not suited for being as protagonist, because they are not interesting.

We don't want to see somebody doing always the right thing, being talented in anything and never wavering in their conviction. That is why Haibara appeals to a lot more people, because she has flaws, has doubts and fears and this make her seem far more human.

Of course, Conan is a lot like that too, but in his case we saw him fail, we constantly see him loathing himself for Ran to suffer and we see him struggle to get back what he has lost. Ran however does nothing of that kind, at least in recent episodes.

When she suspected Conan and pledged to him to finally come back, that was when she showed weakness and when we saw her struggle, but after that, there was never anything else. No doubts that Shinichi could have run of with another girl, no doubts whether he really was still alive, not even searching for him.

So right now, Ran is only waiting. Not chasing after her loved one, not seeing the consistent signs of something being wrong and not questioning what she herself could do.

And that's why she isn't liked and a lot of people see her as unsuited for being with Shinichi. And since they like Shinichi, they want him to end up with somebody who they deem worthy.

&gt;""Dedicated Life domain Cleric called Grace, who has worked as a healer for the better part of three decades before joining the party. She is polite and compassionate, but has a core of stubbornness that makes her very inflexible on certain topics, and struggles to share her burdens with others.  
&gt;  
&gt;Grace is a little shorter than average, and stockily-built. Her iron mask, behind which her face is hidden at virtually all times, has a crude brow, nose and mouth, holes for her eyes, and a small opening at the parting of the mouth. Beneath her metal breastplate she wears white clerical robes, but even parts of her body they would not normally cover are scrupulously wrapped in cloth so that no skin shows. Arranged around her person are pouches of medical tools and supplies: bandages, tinctures, scissors, needles and thread. She carries an iron mace at her hip, which she wields one-handed, and a symbol of Lathander hangs around her neck. The sorry state of her left arm means she usually avoids using it where possible, and she carries no shield. Even before its disfigurement her face was plain, with surly looks and a masculine jaw. The only part of her body ordinarily visible aside from her eyes is her hair, which here and there peeks from beneath her hood in wispy, dirty blonde curls.  
&gt;  
&gt;The old slash wound to her left shoulder is the centre of the grotesque injuries that covers most of her body. The wound itself and its immediate vicinity are shrivelled and black, as though charred. The nearby flesh appears to be in the process of decaying, and in some places has fallen away entirely to expose the musculature and bone underneath; this decay extends down her left arm, radially around her chest, and up the left side of her neck and face, including her nose. Farther away from the wound, the infection manifests as inflammation, lesions and weeping sores. All of this is hidden under bandages beneath her clothes, which she dresses regularly. Only her lower legs and lower right arm are unaffected.  
&gt;  
&gt;Parts of her neck and cheek have fallen away to expose the flesh and bone underneath, resulting in a rasping sound when she draws breath, although her speech has escaped relatively unscathed. Her left arm is significantly weakened, and its tendons and bone are visible beneath the bandages.""

"eodphdz","It is a fair question and it has a real answer. As you will probably hear from any Christian that tries to explain the issue in one way or another, it comes down to context. The Bible is simple in some ways and complex in others. The context issue becomes more complex as you get more and more distant in time and space from the authors, and it is hard to be further removed from us than old testament law.

In the Torah, the aim of the author is to present God's vision and will for a nation, an actual nation of the world, to be his own, special to him. From a Christian's perspective, Israel was like a foothold of relationship in a world that was close to being completely severed from its creator, with the intent that eventually through this particular people, from this foothold, we would get someone like Jesus, who extended that relationship, that covenant with God, to the rest of the world, transcending any national interest.

Now once that transition happened, the game had changed. God organizing a nation as his own is very different than God transcending all the nations through faith in Christ. The situations have little in common, which accounts for Christians paying little heed to the specific laws in the Torah. 

Christians are not a nation on earth; the church does not have to deal with foreign policy, economic policy, demographics, wars, crops, trade, criminal justice, and all the million details that go into running a nation. 

That is why the verse in Deuteronomy doesn't have the same application in a Christian church as it appears on its face in the law. Sometimes a law that governs a nation seems cold and rigid because it is pressing the society towards a positive end by means of control. That is the nature of any nation, including one chosen by God. That is what laws are supposed to do. Even if that nation wants to promote loving, healthy relationships and families, you don't often see it expressed in its laws.

If you read Deuteronomy this way, in general I have found the laws to be very insightful and compassionate, but they are not always good guidelines for your own family because they were not written for that purpose. Other scriptures, including many in the old testament, serve that purpose much better.

When you explore the Bible for passages about how to raise your children and how to treat your family, and about how church members ought to treat each other, you'd be hard pressed to find anything more tender and loving and beautiful written in all the world. And that ulimately is why OP's family fails to be Bible-based.

&gt; I predicted toward the beginning of the preceding essay that those who have already accepted the dogmas of the homosexual community as a source of truth superior to the words of the prophets would be incapable of reading what I had actually written here and would instead interpret my words as intolerance, oppression, gay-bashing, or, an epithet used now without a shred of its original meaning, ""homophobia."" My prediction was exactly fulfilled, and I have had ample opportunity to observe that some supposed proponents of liberty for homosexuals do not believe in freedom of speech for anyone who disagrees with them.

That comes *after* 1800 words in which his message, repeated and clarified in detail, is this:

- Everybody sins; we all need rules and communities to help us do better
- According to the LDS, homosexual behavior is a sin
- If you do it a little, as a Mormon, you should be met with compassionate but firm correction and support
- If you do it a lot, you're not really a Mormon anymore

... that's straightforwardly logical, and sensible, and contains no fear or hatred except for the fundamental disapproval of *all sexual misconduct, homosexuality no more or less than adultery.*

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

For the record: I'm a cis male atheist who has had sex with eight men in his life so far, counting back to the year 2003 (one of those is an ongoing, decade-plus-long relationship).

What you're taking offense at is his *declaration that homosexual behavior is itself sinful.*  That's fine—I also think that's a backwards, misguided, and unjustified position.

But *if you take his religious professions seriously,* then you will see that he's doing the bare minimum required to be *actually consistent.*  He's not advocating for anything other than what *you yourself **ought** to advocate, if you believe that homosexual activity will damn someone's soul to eternal torment.*

He's *absolutely correct* that if you advocate for the acceptance of homosexual behavior, you're not really a Mormon anymore, but some kind of diluted Mormon-prime.  He's no less correct than someone who points out that advocates for birth control aren't really Catholic anymore, but some kind of diluted Catholic-prime.

I think the correct attack here is ""Mormonism is inherently vile,"" not ""Orson Scott Card is a raging homophobe.""

I suspect that you haven't, because Dany in the books is not as you portray her. Not that it's bad if you haven't read them, but they might give you some insight into the reaction you're getting. In the books you get a glimpse at her inner world, and she honestly believes she is doing the right thing a lot of the time.

The issue is that she is naive, so she often makes mistakes. She often puts on an ""ice queen"" persona to hide her lack of experience and confidence - some of the more brutal things she orders, she orders because she is afraid of losing the respect and awe of the people around her.

When you're a 15 year old who commands that much power, losing respect = your death.

She isn't a a total sociopath, but she does learn that fear can be an effective method of control. She's really a fairly normal person who's been pushed into an extreme position. When she says that she wants to help people, she means it, but often she doesn't have the wisdom to understand the consequences of her actions.

There's a time in the books where she wants to help some of her subjects who have been quarantined due to a disease, so she goes out with her soldiers to walk amongst them, give them medicine, and see the situation for herself. Of course, this is not a good idea, but she believes she won't get sick because of her ""dragon blood"". She's compassionate but also arrogant and lacks foresight.

&gt;Watching “The Hunchback of Notre Dame”. I found myself rooting for Quasimodo through he movie, and when he *didn’t* get with Esmeralda, I was mad. Furious. He *deserves* to be with her, for how noble and brave he has been. He should have her, and she should “give him a chance.”  
&gt;  
&gt;Then, I don’t know why, but something clicked after that thought. Esmeralda clearly was happy with the other guy. I mentally flipped the script, and realized I would not be saying the same if Quasi is handsome and Esmeralda was ugly.  
&gt;  
&gt;I also realize that Judge Frollo was the character who most shared my mindset at the time; he *deserves* Esmeralda, for he is so pure and good. Frollo being the antagonist caused me to really reconsider my thoughts on relationships, girls, and generally just the way I treated women.  
&gt;

"enktk5f","Well put.

I made [this post](https://old.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/bln720/spoilers_extended_dont_overthink_jaimes/) last week, when everyone was assuming that Jaime was going back to KL to actually kill Cersei.

Ep4 showed Jaime coming to grips with the fact that his sister and lover was going to die. He was able to forget about it when fighting the walkers, and if he had died in that fight, none of the rest would matter anyway. But once he survived, and the focus turned to KL, he couldn't ignore it any longer...and he couldn't stand idly by while it happened. We even see him continue to deny it early in Ep5, during the scene with Tyrion. He's literally going through the different stages of grief in front of us.

Jaime was an incredibly complex character - arrogant yet honorable, capable of both vile acts and heroic deeds, both cruel and compassionate. But from start to finish, Cersei was always his blind spot, and no matter how far he came as a person, at the end of it all, the ""gods cursed him to love a hateful woman"", and he couldn't stay away. And died unnecessarily because of it.

I do think the sudden turn-around in Ep4 felt abrupt. Maybe the writers could have done a better job of explaining what was going through his head (there were hints in his reactions to other characters in that episode, but very subtle). But after having some time to chew on it, I think I like where this ended up. Not every character gets a full redemption arc and a heroic death. Some get 75% of the way there, then backslide into their old ways and die unceremoniously under a collapsing castle.

"endft6a","First of all, I think this dichotomy is false. Is there is not a scale with one end being ""having a good heart"" and the other end being ""competent."" One must be a competent pastor and have a heart.

However, this conversation speaks to is the reality that pastors often excel at being pastoral (compassionate, friendly, outgoing, or other ""heart"" categories) or at running the business of the church (being a good supervisor, insuring the business of the church is handled, organizing meetings, compiling budgets).

So, what I would say is that it is important to have a balance of ""heart"" and competency across the entire church staff. I like the vision of a church with, say, a parish administrator who is the one responsible for the business of the church, and a pastor who is responsible for planning and leading worship, preaching, teaching, and providing pastoral care. When a pastor has to track down contractors to replace the front door or anything like that, each minute of that work is shifted from ministry-focused work to business-focused work. And heaven forbid we have to decide between fixing the front door or visiting someone in the hospital. Because, as a pastor, there is no question in my mind: the pastoral care need outweighs the practical need of replacing the front door. And yet, on Sunday, someone is going to say something about the door that needs to be fixed. At that point, your options are to try to please everyone and work yourself to death or let things go as needed only to foster resentment among your congregation over why you can't get everything done. It's a catch-22 situation.

So, we as pastors need to be both competent and compassionate. But if you mean addressing ministry needs versus business needs, I'd rather outsource all that work to a skilled parish administrator.",1557782156,"so, we as pastors need to be both competent and compassionate.","competent and compassionate","compassionate",NA,FALSE,"competent and compassionate","competent",NA,NA,0

In the books (and early in the series), it's implied he lived but in the show? He's gone.  Died to Meryn fucking Trant, as even the Hound laughs.  But let's say he did live.  So what?  Let's say he was the best.  Remember that Arya was 9 when she was training.  Nine years old.  Think about that.  And she trained for a few weeks, chasing cats and learning posture.  If it WAS implied that she was some sort of prodigy, she would have been backflipping and dagger tossing at Harrenhal, killing Tywin and everyone like a ninja.  She didn't.  She was just a kid.

As for the blind training, yeah...that's it.  She was blind and learned to fight in the dark.  You're right.  Ok...so where did she learn precision with throwing?  From that (literally) ONE archery lesson from the Brotherhood?  From the waif?  After their (conveniently faded out) battle, she literally just swung from wild, childish Arya into somber, SUPERHUMAN Arya in heartbeat.  The pivotal difference in her character literally occurred after one single event; killing the waif.  After which she came back to Westeros and became a sociopath, killing innocents to sate her bloodlust, wiping out many innocent Freys because of the actions of one of them.  She's a monster.  But somehow, she's also SUPERCOOL, WISE GIRL.

You can certainly say ""well you have to read between the lines!  That stuff is implied!"".  Ok, but that's exceptionally poor storytelling.  If they set her off on that trajectory and then cut back to her later, I get it.  They did not.  She went from a bratty blind kid in a (hilariously lenient) death cult, to a Karate Kid, to Batman in the kind of jumps that would make a high school drama teacher sigh.  And the fact that she didn't even know who the NK was but ends up being the one to take him out, despite Jon fighting him his entire life?  D&amp;D themselves admitted they only planned it that way to make it unexpected.  And it was awful.  Arya's growth should have been about dealing with her trauma and learning NOT to kill; death became a convenience for her and was sinking her further into darkness.  Coming out of that was always the point.  Not some punch up with a cartoon villain.  And now she's somber, world-weary batman who's got few words for others and fewer for us.  Just ICY cool. And it's ridiculous.  She physically transformed in a ridiculous way, and we have to just agree to her mental changes...just cause.  Draw me the through-line between Arya at the Braavosi play to Arya landing in Westeros.  There's none.  They just did it and expect people to do their work for them and fill all the gaps in.  And it looks like you're only too happy to do it.

&gt; I disagree with your assessment of Danys character arc as well. She didn’t suddenly become mad. It’s been her arc all along. She’s always struggled with trying to be better than her father.

No, she struggled under the shadow of her father.  There was no ""struggle"" to not become mad/crazy; she was never fighting any mental illness.  She acted out viciously and out of temper at times but no more than anyone else and the show and writing were always very careful to justify it; to show that rulers must be compassionate but also strict and just.  They painted her in a white light, not us.  Her turn this season is so forced and one dimensional.  Some death glares because she isn't getting her way.  It's obnoxiously bad writing.

&gt; This is driving her to be consumed by the madness she has been desperately fighting to subdue.

Where?  When?  What scene has she *ever* been trying to ""subdue her madness""?  What are you talking about?  Did I miss an episode?

&gt; It was also pretty clear that Missandei was told by grey worm to board a smaller escape raft which then must’ve been captured by Euron.

Uh ok.  I mean if you want to make up head cannon to fill the gaps of the show, that's great.  But that doesn't excuse the writing, that's you coming up with excuses *for* the writing.

&gt; Idk, I think you and others are overly critical. The show writing has flaws and they are showing in season 8 but at the same time people are choosing to be upset about things that were actually done well in the show and are choosing to overlook perfectly good plot points to paint this picture that Game of Thrones is garbage.

No, not really.  I think it's people like yourself who are excusing the writing because you enjoy it.  And that's totally fine.  The Fast &amp; The Furious has awful writing and it's beloved.  You're allowed to enjoy what you enjoy.  But claiming that the show's writing is actually great is...kind of ridiculous.  You don't see ANYONE doing that for F&amp;F.

The GoT writers in a recent interview (Benioff, to be specific) was asked about themes and he said that 'themes are for eighth grade book reports'.  D&amp;D don't care about theming...which was absolutely critical for GoT, and for writing as a whole.  Redemption wasn't as simple as doing good thing after bad thing.  Good vs evil wasn't as simple as a punch up with bad guys.  Politics were actually complex, characters were complex, conflict of the human heart was the point.

Now it's simply all about set pieces, characters quipping, and subverting ""expectations"".  It's about cheering people in a bar.  It's disposable entertainment, rather than meaningful work; those surprises only work the first time - it's second viewings that is killing the show now because people realize how awful the writing is once the surprises are gone.  It's disposable.  The writers don't care.  They use cheap tricks (telling, instead of showing - fade outs to skip any complex scenes - etc).  Their dialogue is all self-referential and quipping; it's significantly more important *who* is talking instead of what's being said because the words themselves are so tripe.  The action and battles are astonishingly stupid.  

And worst of all, ALL the characters have become one dimensional tropes.  Take Beric as an example.  When he first lit his sword, it was wondrous and mysterious.  It was magic.  But like all the fantasy in GoT, it was grounded in reality.  The fire weakened the steel and the Hound cut through it.  It was a brilliant way of showing the world's approach to magic.  Now?  Beric is just FLAMESWORDMAN.  He lights his sword on fire because that's his superpower and his whole THING.  That's all he is, that's all he's left.

And so it is with everyone.  Arya, Tyrion, Sansa, Cersei, Jaime, Brienne, Jon, Davos, Varys, Littlefinger, etc.  They aren't complex, they're just one dimensional plot devices, steering the scene to then next big wow moment and then changing again to suit the next one.  They're the Avengers; everyone's got a one-liner, everyone's got a quip, everyone's got a gimmick.  One trick ponies, all of them.  And it wouldn't be so bad if they hadn't started out as the complex oddities that we all grew to love to begin with.

It really is objectively awful.  You're allowed to enjoy it, certainly.  If you do, good on you.  I'm happy for you.  But saying that it's ""well done"" or has ""perfectly good plot point""?  Nah.

"em9hrjq","Two former podcast guests talk about Islam from a variety of angles including:

* The role of Trump and 9/11 in shaping a Muslim identity.
* Identity politics and Muslims
* What Haider calls the ""compassionate but empty-headed"" position of many defenders of Islam and how they treat it
* On that same topic: the misguided (in both their eyes) push to show support by inadvertently elevating things like the hijab to *the* symbol of Muslim women in general.
* How the US should relate to illiberal Muslim nations in the world and so on.

Over time I've come to find Hamid's position to be more and more...thin tbh. Even worse, it has the whiff of apologetics.

His basic position seems to be:""just let Muslims do things, even if those things are highly illiberal or hyperconservative because Islam is exceptional"". He wants the West to let them do it in Muslim countries (which is one thing) but then he also wants the West to do the same in their own, more liberal or progressive nations. He complains about a vague ""pressure"" being pushed on Muslims to liberalize (which, as Haider points out, is part of how social change happens)

It seems to me he has no strong response to the conservative who says: ""Just keep them out if their beliefs are so exceptional and so indissoluble to our culture"" (he was asked as much by Gad Saad and had a weak retort). He is, in essence, depending on the goodwill of existing voters (and the existence of large blocs of Muslims allowed in by less pessimistic folk) to stymie such proposals, to such a point where it simply becomes a reality that Islam is a part of the nation and now has to be dealt with (at which point he goes ""well, Islam isn't going to change and the people are here already so the least bad option is to just let them live in their ""exceptional"" way""). The problem is: if those voters were convinced to be as pessimistic as Hamid is it's unclear that they would still back immigration. 

Seems like his position only exists because people don't agree with him and people have already let in Muslims out of optimism. What can he say to, for example, an Eastern European country that has little to no Muslims but just refuses to take them in cause they don't want to deal with this ""Islamic exceptionalism""? He himself sets the table quite clearly for an anti-immigration argument.",1556747821,"* identity politics and muslims * what haider calls the ""compassionate but empty-headed"" position of many defenders of islam and how they treat it * on that same topic: the misguided (in both their eyes) push to show support by inadvertently elevating things like the hijab to *the* symbol of muslim women in general.","compassionate but empty","compassionate","but",FALSE,"compassionate but empty","empty",NA,NA,1

I once knew a person who, physically speaking, was low-ish average. They had a good deal of acne (they were in senior year of high school) and honestly were physically forgettable. I realize this sounds harsh, but I'm trying to put into words the fact that I and most others had never thought of them as particularly attractive--they simply didn't stand out in that aspect. It's tough to describe in a way that sounds nice.

Anyway, I had the pleasure of being placed in a class with this person and getting to know them a bit better. They were what could only be described as a free spirit, caring about social obligations but realizing that life was about more than that. They understood how important is can be to not be tethered, but also stayed close to friends and family. This person was kind and compassionate, but not at all shy, and had a sort of chaotic and messy... balance? They were at peace with chaos and could smile and laugh like no other I have ever known. Needless to say by this point, but I fell in love with their personality. As odd as this is going to sound, they instantly became physically attractive to me. Physical flaws meant nothing and even became cute in a way. All that to say, my attraction to them was based off a lot more than just physical characteristics. In fact, their physical attractiveness shifted in my eyes after getting to see other factors. Attraction is a curious thing, and is more fluid than one might think.

&amp;#x200B;

Dedicated Life domain Cleric called Grace, who has worked as a healer for the better part of three decades before joining the party. She is polite and compassionate, but has a core of stubbornness that makes her very inflexible on certain topics, and struggles to share her burdens with others.  
Grace is a little shorter than average, and stockily-built. Her iron mask, behind which her face is hidden at virtually all times, has a crude brow, nose and mouth, holes for her eyes, and a small opening at the parting of the mouth. Beneath her metal breastplate she wears white clerical robes, but even parts of her body they would not normally cover are scrupulously wrapped in cloth so that no skin shows. Arranged around her person are pouches of medical tools and supplies: bandages, tinctures, scissors, needles and thread. She carries an iron mace at her hip, which she wields one-handed, and a symbol of Lathander hangs around her neck. The sorry state of her left arm means she usually avoids using it where possible, and she carries no shield. Even before its disfigurement her face was plain, with surly looks and a masculine jaw. The only part of her body ordinarily visible aside from her eyes is her hair, which here and there peeks from beneath her hood in wispy, dirty blonde curls.

The old slash wound to her left shoulder is the centre of the grotesque injuries that covers most of her body. The wound itself and its immediate vicinity are shrivelled and black, as though charred. The nearby flesh appears to be in the process of decaying, and in some places has fallen away entirely to expose the musculature and bone underneath; this decay extends down her left arm, radially around her chest, and up the left side of her neck and face, including her nose. Farther away from the wound, the infection manifests as inflammation, lesions and weeping sores. All of this is hidden under bandages beneath her clothes, which she dresses regularly. Only her lower legs and lower right arm are unaffected.

Parts of her neck and cheek have fallen away to expose the flesh and bone underneath, resulting in a rasping sound when she draws breath, although her speech has escaped relatively unscathed. Her left arm is significantly weakened, and its tendons and bone are visible beneath the bandages.""

"elrcd68","Had fun working on this commission.

&amp;#x200B;

Dedicated Life domain Cleric called Grace, who has worked as a healer for the better part of three decades before joining the party. She is polite and compassionate, but has a core of stubbornness that makes her very inflexible on certain topics, and struggles to share her burdens with others.  
Grace is a little shorter than average, and stockily-built. Her iron mask, behind which her face is hidden at virtually all times, has a crude brow, nose and mouth, holes for her eyes, and a small opening at the parting of the mouth. Beneath her metal breastplate she wears white clerical robes, but even parts of her body they would not normally cover are scrupulously wrapped in cloth so that no skin shows. Arranged around her person are pouches of medical tools and supplies: bandages, tinctures, scissors, needles and thread. She carries an iron mace at her hip, which she wields one-handed, and a symbol of Lathander hangs around her neck. The sorry state of her left arm means she usually avoids using it where possible, and she carries no shield. Even before its disfigurement her face was plain, with surly looks and a masculine jaw. The only part of her body ordinarily visible aside from her eyes is her hair, which here and there peeks from beneath her hood in wispy, dirty blonde curls.

The old slash wound to her left shoulder is the centre of the grotesque injuries that covers most of her body. The wound itself and its immediate vicinity are shrivelled and black, as though charred. The nearby flesh appears to be in the process of decaying, and in some places has fallen away entirely to expose the musculature and bone underneath; this decay extends down her left arm, radially around her chest, and up the left side of her neck and face, including her nose. Farther away from the wound, the infection manifests as inflammation, lesions and weeping sores. All of this is hidden under bandages beneath her clothes, which she dresses regularly. Only her lower legs and lower right arm are unaffected.

Parts of her neck and cheek have fallen away to expose the flesh and bone underneath, resulting in a rasping sound when she draws breath, although her speech has escaped relatively unscathed. Her left arm is significantly weakened, and its tendons and bone are visible beneath the bandages.""

"elpjz9d","What you're legally allowed to do is to treat them no differently than you did prior to the end of the notice period.

Removing locks, removing doors, cutting power/water/heat -- even internet if it's included in the lease agreement, cutting telephone hard lines, making loud noises, bad smells, being a jerk, harassing, intimidating, even standing on the perimiter of the property and staring your coldest meanest stare all have the effect of making a judge want to find ways to help the tenant out.

For a 30 day notice, where 30 days is sufficient to satisfy the law, you start off by having the upper hand.  There isn't much the tenant can do, and a judge will be compassionate but firm ""You have to leave, ma'am.  You've known this for 30 days.""

Trying to annoy or intimidate people into leaving makes the judge want to cut her every possible break there is, and find in her favor on damages claims like ""tenant harassment"".  Most of the shitty stupid things landlords do are expressly illegal (removing locks, doors, etc., cutting power) and can carry stiff penalties.

Changing the wifi password is probably legal if it's not covered in the lease, but it's going to look petty as fuck when you're standing in front of a judge and she brings it up.  It costs you nothing, and no claim you have to want to accelerate her leaving is going to be taken as legitimate.

Except the one other thing you can do:  Offer her money for an earlier departure date. (For a weird set of reasons, offering her money if she promises to move out on the date she already has to move out is prone to issues, because you have to receive a material benefit or there is no contract.  So ""I'll pay you $500 if you're gone by midnight April 29"" (assuming 30th is the last day).

"eljcojg","Ha!  Welcome to therapy. Think if it from a systems standpoint. Until now things have worked a certain way. When you entered therapy you changed and that changed the way you interacted with others and that will of necessity change the way they interact with you.  Throw a stone in a pond you get ripples. 

But change makes people uncomfortable so the easiest response is to push back with “we’ve always done it this way”  because otherwise the people around you have to look at their behavior and ALSO change. 

When I first went to therapy I used to referee fights between my brother and my mother and would sit on the phone with them half the night talking about ridiculous things. When I started therapy I stopped doing that and they were both LIVID and told me therapy ruined our family (at least they agreed on that). After awhile when I didn’t pick up my role as mediator they figured it out and just talked to each other and everyone was happier.

"elj62fe","Not 100% sure since im not a cop, but have dealt with cops often throughout my life (in non-criminal, more friendly ways). From what i understand, there are many extenuating circumstances and other factors at play other than ""break the law, go to jail."" For example, if the cop is dealing with some high school kid and a gram of weed, the kid will get a big fat warning and maybe a phone call to mom. Not every cop will do this, just like we all know not everyone is kind and compassionate, but a lot of them will. It may be illegal, but its not a big deal. 

My point is, if it was an emergency and your SO thought your condition was too dangerous to wait for an ambulance for, im sure the cops will at least not give him the full punishment, and in the end its ultimately the judge's decision.

"elirs1k","I’m a Catholic and I can testify that this is probably NOT the right way to go. The idea that you can just convert right before and be saved is kinda bs. There are a lot of people who dedicate themselves to God and evangelization and all that good stuff that deserve the Kingdom of Heaven. That being said, it is still heavily debated whether or not good atheists go to Heaven, and I believe that, in short, yes, they do. This is because we understand that some people grow up in the faith and are exposed to it, so they have that “edge”. But really there is a forgotten crowd of great people who are kind and compassionate but have never been exposed to the faith and hence did not grow up with it. Ultimately God doesn’t persecute you for not knowing Him in your life if you were never properly exposed to Him. He, as we understand, is all-knowing, and understands that if there is good in your heart that you are welcome in the Kingdom of Heaven. If you decide to convert last second for the sake of getting into Heaven, it’s probably being done with malicious intent, so it is best to just die as the good person you are and have God bring you into Heaven. :)",1555964435,"but really there is a forgotten crowd of great people who are kind and compassionate but have never been exposed to the faith and hence did not grow up with it.","kind and compassionate","compassionate",NA,FALSE,"kind and compassionate","kind",NA,NA,0

"elgd9w6","Man that sucks. I am feeling a lot of anger for you. I am also an artist/musician and I made music about it too. I'm sorry your outlet has been effectively silenced. If you do go back to posting you have to be picky/choosy with who you share it with. Doing blanket posting leaves you vulnerable with your music. But if you pick and choose and let them share amongst themselves you have more protection.

If it ever happens again (believe me it will if you keep blanket posting) you have to remain very calm and cool headed. If you seem rational, and like you are safe, they have no reason to take you there just because someone made a call. But *if you give them any reasonable doubt* (like reacting emotionally when they knock on your door), they will force you back there because you basically left them no choice. They can't leave a suicidal person without assistance because it opens them up to lawsuits, not because they care. Obvi cops are human and there are many who are empathetic and compassionate but there are many who are not because they are too jaded from experience.

You have to learn to be a good actor, and give them what they want to see and hear.

I've had this happen to me. Except I had social media, and the post was completely taken out of context and was meant to be a joke. I was cool, collected, and was even eating a banana while they were at my door. (Eating gave me something to do with my hands instead of appearing anxious which would give them reasonable doubt). I joked with them to kind of prove my intentions, and they took a picture of my tweets from my profile and left.

I've had this happen one time before as well, and I made a post on FB about wanting to never wake up. I was in so much pain that day, all I could do was cry. So when the officers came to my door I was bawling and they immediately took me no questions asked. I was very confused because they didn't really talk to me about what was going on, I just was told to pack some things and had handcuffs placed on my hands (at the front) with my jacket covering my hands while they escorted me out of my apartment.

"elfcnax","I doubt that's true. There is pretty little evidence to suggest that just hoping drug addicts seek voluntary treatment before they die is a better outcome statistically, and there is some evidence mandatory treatment works just as well or better than voluntary: 

&gt;Prior research has shown that mandated clients have lower motivation for change ([Hartford et al., 1976](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3578041/#R37)) and internally motivated individuals are more likely to experience long-term behavior change ([Deci &amp; Ryan, 1985](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3578041/#R22)). However, more recent studies show that treatment does not need to be voluntary to be effective. For example, research has demonstrated that substance abusers who are court ordered to treatment did as well as or better than those who entered voluntarily ([Brecht et al., 1993](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3578041/#R11); [Farabee et al., 1998](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3578041/#R31); [Hiller et al., 1998](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3578041/#R38); [Kelly et al., 2005](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3578041/#R48); [Martin et al., 2003](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3578041/#R57)).

There's a lot of details that I feel complicate the issue. My sister has a history of being dramatic, jealous, and belligerent.

"elb75sc","Well technically Henry **did** have a viable male heir who took over before Mary did after he died: Edward VI.

But if you mean another, earlier and less controversial heir, well - first of all, a lot would depend on who the prince's mother is, as you say. Catherine of Aragon would be the easiest to work with since she *actually* delivered a son (Henry the New Year's Boy) who lived for nearly two months before suddenly dying. Assuming Henry Jr. lives, that changes pretty much the entire course of English history. Henry VIII will have no reason to want to divorce Catherine, which means the English break from Catholicism never happens, and the Tudor dynasty can plausibly survive much longer, maybe to the present day. Good Queen Bess is either never born in the first place, or remains an insignificant royal bastard who's probably married off to a mid-tier nobleman at some point.

Considering he died so young, it's impossible to know exactly what Henry Jr. would've been like had he lived to adulthood. For all we know he could've been a ruthless but efficient penny-pinching ruler like his grandfather, a hotheaded womanizer with a short temper like his father, a religious zealot unafraid of battle like his mother, or a compassionate but ineffective ruler like Henry VI.

That said, if I had to guess at him resembling some combination of his parents' traits (good and bad): 'warlike, temperamental, and passionately interested in the opposite sex' with a pinch of 'Catholic devotion' seems about right. Despite his ferocity and volcanic temper, I doubt he'll be as cruel as his sister Mary was, if only because there won't be many English Protestants for him to persecute in this timeline - hell with Henry Jr. still alive, Mary herself will probably turn out alright without the trauma of their father divorcing their mother, mistreating her, and spitting on the Catholic faith which she held to so fervently. Scottish Protestants might want to watch out for young Henry, though.

It's compassionate but inefficient and crazy expensive. Also, I can see no possibility except for a bifurcated health care system resulting from this setup.

"el429ri","Like many atheists, nothing really ""went wrong"" for me.  I wasn't driven away by the church, my parents don't hate me and I don't hate them.  There weren't any bad experiences -- at least nothing worse than the boredom involved in doing something you don't want to do.

No, none of that.  But there are 2 very specific turning points that changed how I thought of the religion I was raised in.  There's a whole lot of other stuff that built up to my de-conversion, but these two specific points are certainly critical catalysts.

The first was when I was pretty young.  I want to say 6 or 7.  You see, there's this phrase, ""God fearing christian.""  I thought it was just one of those awkwardly phrased archaic sayings because I thought it was ""God-faring christian.""  But I realized I wasn't hearing it wrong.  That it actually *was* ""God fearing christian.""  But the god my parents tell me about and that I learn about in sunday school was an all-loving, all-forgiving god of infinite compassion.  So why the fear?  Why be *proud* of being pants-shittingly terrified of that god?  (side note: Look up the etymology of both ""terrific"" and ""awesome"" and then consider how frequently people use those words in association with god and then ask yourself which came first:  The positive connotation or the use in relation to god...)

So that was the first catalyst.  The first realization that people hold self-contradictory views of what god is like.

Nothing directly came of this, but it was clearly significant enough to my psyche that I remember it to this day.

--------------

The second catalyst was around 14 or 15.  I was raised mormon and if you don't know, you get bestowed the ""priesthood"" at like age 12 (it's young).  Priests in the mormon church are not the equivalent of pastors or chaplains or whatever.  Literally all men hold the ""priesthood"" and are expected to at least occasionally participate in rituals, mostly various blessings until you get to the weird parts of the temple (I left long before then so I'm not the best to ask about that!).  But until relatively recently - 70s, I think? - black men were not allowed to hold the priesthood because their black skin is indicative of a curse from god -- the curse of Ham, I think.

But, the thing is, one of the core tenants of the mormonism is that original sin just isn't a thing.  It's literally one of their articles of faith 

&gt;2. We believe that men will be punished for their own sins, and not for Adam's transgression.

And I was always taught in sundayschool that this means there is no such thing as sins of the father.  You are judged for *you.*  But how does that jive with the curse of ham and the priesthood ban?

The answer, of course, is it doesn't.  And it took close to 150 years of constant communication between the church leaders and god (after all, the president of the church is referred to as ""Prophet"" for a reason) to figure this out.

After the second catalyst it was like the blinders had been lifted off my eyes and I could finally see what was in the edges of my vision all along:  The bible, the book of mormon, the church history, all of christianity... can't be the work of the god they claim it is.

Everywhere I looked I realized that the beliefs of the christians around me (mormon and otherwise) were in a kind of quantum superposition.  Mormons aren't (generally) anti-science, so Noah's flood was in a weird position of both being literally true and being allegorical because the physical evidence says it never happened.  Magic was both imaginary superstition and factually true (after all, nobody was surprised that pharo's priests could actually turn their staves into snakes in Exodus), God is both loving enough to save noah and his family and malicious enough to execute literally everyone else on the planet.

Everywhere I looked the beliefs I was raised to hold were true and not true at the same time.  All loving but full of hatred, all compassionate but full of genocidal rage, true stories that must be allegories, God speaks to everyone but nobody can know what he says.

So I came to the only conclusion I could:  The bible was the work of men and the god so contradictory described within didn't exist.  And everything that I was seeing with a critical eye made sense.

And from there it was just a hop, skip and a jump to full blown atheism.  Nobody's ever presented any convincing evidence that *their* god was any different - and idea of man.",1555518109,"all loving but full of hatred, all compassionate but full of genocidal rage, true stories that must be allegories, god speaks to everyone but nobody can know what he says.","compassionate but full","compassionate","but",FALSE,"compassionate but full","full",NA,NA,1

"ekzbshg","Hello. Thank you so much for your post, your ideas and contributions are helpful to the community and really are appreciated. I am the moderator you spoke to yesterday. We absolutely do believe people should assume a context of abuse generally, that this is a sub for developmental trauma survivors specifically. In terms of assuming a context of abuse in relation to the specifics of any post it is more complex though. A spirit of openness is important if survivors actually hope to be a support to one another. Trauma survivors are in no way responsible for their abuse, ever. And they are not responsible for trauma responses at a fundamental level. 

But trauma survivors are still people. There are going to be situations where empathetic and compassionate confrontation is valid. I do not feel like the person you spoke to was particularly empathetic or compassionate. But so long as its polite and not a jerk there is something to be said for trying to understand they meant well. Or don't, and have a respectful debate with them, which is also valid. 

At the end of the day openness has to have real value within the rules we have though. This sub has been accused of being a ""syrup bucket"" or ""crab bucket"". That is not accurate. This sub does prioritize empathy, validation, compassion and relatedness. First and foremost it is vital. But we are all survivors. There are barriers there. People are not always going to find it easy. For myself it is entirely plausible that kind or not I can come off as stilted or analytical or forced as a result of the autism. 

Others people want to help people, want to relate to other survivors, but are in a place in their thinking where their best comes across as unempathetic or passive aggressive. And if this is a pattern and the person simply will not change the behavior there have been warnings, temp bans, and permanent bans. gracefullytoxic and not-moses are most notable in the time I have been here. But its gotta be a pattern of invalidation. Trauma survivors are too likely to mean well and have what they said sound worse than they intended time for time. 

I don't know, God knows I take your concern seriously. I will speak to the other moderators about any way we can help people feel more safe. But openness and inclusiveness have to be nearly as important as compassion and empathy to this subs values. We would simply be limiting so many vulnerable people who are not healthy enough at times to respond ideally if we expected idealized compassion or empathy. This is just my personal impression though, it is as mod, but it is not fleshed out and has not been discussed. We will look into your basic idea and try to find ways to encourage empathy, and do value your being here.",1555372141,"there are going to be situations where empathetic and compassionate confrontation is valid.","empathetic and compassionate","compassionate",NA,FALSE,"where empathetic and compassionate","empathetic",NA,"where",0

Alita killing Vector was cold blooded murder . The fact that she had ""legitimate"" reasons to do it is something else . 
Someone killed attempted to kill your brother  and you get the jump on him while he s unarmed and in no position to be a threat to you or anyone . If you kill him it s murder.
Maybe the movie was too colorful but Gunnm is the story of a girl who gets a chance for a do-over .She gets her innocence back and the question is will she become what she was because you cant change what you are  no matter what ? or will she become a better person because it s up to you to become who you want to be .
There is a reason Ido didnt tell her what he knew about her origins and why he didnt want her to get the berserker body 
And that reason is : you dont become one of the most efficient killing machines in the universe by picking up flowers and singing kumbayah .
The thing Ido fears the most is her reverting to what she was prior to her memory loss and that s what leads her to Vector s death .
She killed him because she felt like it... simple as that .

He was too involved with playing games online..  I took the computer away, and living with him was horrible.. he was angry, rude, and volatile.

"ektg7nz","To be honest, I found Jasmine so annoying in season 1 and some of her behavior was inappropriate like when she kept pawing at Olivia's underwear, tried to steal it, and then tried on Olivia's dress which she ended up ripping without Olivia's permission and the peeing in someone's sink.  I can see why they would find her annoying and not want to hang with her.  Also, she seems like she's kind of gossipy and maybe the friends were worried she may spread their business all over school.  In season 2 however, she calmed that annoying/inappropriateness down a little although that whole scene where she had those girls in the gym competing for a date with Ruby was kind of cringey, so I do actually like Jasmine more now.

That's very often not even remotely true, and seriously undermines your point. It's very difficult to find any practical solution when there are people who say things demonstrably false and expect others to be convinced.

The truth is that there are very serious, and very common, examples of systemic law-breaking that directly lead to people being on the streets. Not breaking the law _by_ living on the streets, but the behaviors that often _lead_ to homelessness. Schedule I and II drug use, breach of contract (e.g., failure to pay rent, adhere to housing rules, etc), sexual offenses, acts of violence, are all very typical *causes* for people to end up on the street. 

Your not even acknowledging that those issues exist, which they are frequently the immediate causes of homelessness, does not help you advocate for the rights of the homeless. Instead, your words can push a lot of compassionate but realistic people to simply tune you out entirely.

Please consider the unintended consequences of not being forthright. Even good people (like you?) can hurt their own cause with poor rhetoric.

This seems to be a really supportive and compassionate community from what I've seen so far, and I've gotten lots of good info and references from the folks here. Listen, I'm pretty much a newb, so I don't know what concrete advice I can offer, but I think the fact that you were *not* too proud to seek help is a sign of good character and wisdom. I would suggest hanging around here, talking to others and asking questions when they arise. And talk, talk, talk, to your sub. Communicate openly with one another. Speak honestly with your partner about all the things.   


My Dom is my husband, and the dynamic you're describing sounds similar to ours. We are not necessarily a 24/7 dynamic but maybe it kind of is? yeah- ownership... I guess it probably might be considered 24/7. (sorry, I'm new I don't know all the lingo and parameters yet)  Anyway, my Husband is extremely attentive and kind. He *never* loses his patience. I have no idea how he does it, I've never seen anything like it before. He is understanding and compassionate but takes no shit. He will go to any (legal and morally sound) length to make sure that I and our children have whatever we need, and much of what we want. He is tender when it's time for tenderness and stern when it's time for discipline. He makes me laugh, he encourages me to speak what's on my heart and mind and he listens carefully and responds lovingly when I do. He kills all the bugs and doesn't laugh at me or make me feel bad about it. That's not sarcasm, it seems like a small thing but it's not - kill the bugs. He is never unkind. Not in word or deed or tone. Never. He rarely scolds or admonishes or is judgemental towards me, we are all about praise and positive reinforcement around here and personally, I'm convinced it's The Way. It's the reason it works (for us). He makes me feel like The Queen Of The World, and *every single thing* he does to me knocks my flippin socks off. So he gets ownership.   
I hope that helps some. It's not very specific, I know, but sometimes I think it's a general attitude, or way of being that determines if you are ""getting it right"" or not, more so than the specifics. But again, I'm so new to all this I might not know what I'm talking about so, grain-of-salt and all that, okay?  Best of luck to you and your lady.

Generally, physicians are kind and compassionate, but I think in some cases accommodating to a fault. Sure, personalities vary widely, but the lobbying groups will or should generally reflect the average goals of its members.

Some people are just great at being empathetic and compassionate but not necessarily encumber these traits.

"ejtti4d","So I’ve actually struggled with a lot of the same stuff, except I frame it in a bit of a different way. For me it’s less about “living in a society” that tolerates and enables abusers and more about “living in a universe” in which such things are even possible. I’m basically pissed not only at human beings but also at god, despite being an atheist. There’s just *so* much cruelty in the world and it all feels not just senseless, but downright fucking *evil.* Malicious. We both get to be born trans, through no fault of our own, just born like that, for no reason whatsoever other than nature *can* make us that way without sufficiently compromising reproductive fitness and thus it did make us that way. We both get to be tortured for it by people who get away with it, for no better reason whatsoever than those people *can* get away with it.

But I choose to live in spite of all of that. Because I’m in a position where I *can* live in spite of all of it. I imagine that maybe you’re not in that position right now, from what it sounds like, and that you’ll have to struggle for a long time to get there. I had to do that too. It probably wasn’t as hard as what you’ll have to go through because my abusers weren’t as powerful as yours seem to be. Because my starting position was better in some ways. Because it took me longer to realize I was trans and so I was already mostly at the point where I could start transitioning right away as soon as I found out and no one could prevent it. I don’t know what I would have done had this not been the case.

But still. It sounds to me like you’re thinking about suicide not so much for immediate pragmatic reasons as for moral reasons. You just don’t want to be part of a world anymore that allows things to happen like what have happened to you.

Here’s how I feel about that. And please forgive me for being a little weird about it all.

I feel like the universe is inherently meaningless and cruel, and that it’s cruel *because* it’s meaningless. Like there’s no cosmic force that prevents cruelty. Cruelty is just something that is possible, and thus it exists. But it’s also possible for the opposite of cruelty to exist. It’s possible for things like justice to exist. Humans can make that shit happen if we choose to do so. And there’s lots of places in the world where humans have chosen to do so. I live in such a place, a place where society is creating structures that make it harder and harder for people to get away with the kind of shit that our parents did to us. It’s not perfect by any means and there’s no guarantee it will continue to get better forever, but it’s *possible,* and it actually is happening.

Now here’s the weird part. The thing that I’ve noticed about societies like the one I live in is that in a way they do emerge naturally. Things like trans tolerance and acceptance, the protection of trans kids, justice for abusive people, etc., all emerge from a simple, common source: People choose to look at the world in an honest way, without lying to themselves about what reality actually is, and these kinds of ideas just spring forth from that. Trans acceptance owes so much more to honest scientific inquiry than to any other factor. Justice demands and requires honest investigations of facts and fails when people are allowed to be dishonest. I feel like this is all not a coincidence. I feel like it means something that goodness actually and inevitably emerges from looking at the world as it actually is. That philosophies that promote evil behavior consistently seem to require dishonesty.

It’s no coincidence at all, I think, that societies that promote honesty and justice tend to thrive economically and technologically compared to those that don’t. Authoritarianism and reality-denial inevitably require destruction of individual potential and quashing of dynamism that fuel innovation. Just look at what’s been happening in China as the government there has become more repressive and authoritarian over time after a period of relative freedom and anti-corruption. Just look at “blue states” and progressive EU countries over “red states” and countries with more authoritarian, corrupt regimes. None of these examples are in any way pure, all of them are complicated, but the general trends hold true.

This all makes me believe like the universe actually is meaningful. That intelligent life is meant to discover the fact that it both can and should promote goodness and justice. That although said life *can* fall into an authoritarian, corrupt singularity of “a boot stomping on a human face, for ever,” it also can ascend into something that transcends the cruelty of the universe, that masters it, that eliminates it.

I also believe that it’s not my personal responsibility to help make this happen, any more than it is anyone else’s. I try to do my best to make it more likely to occur; I try to teach my child to be a good person, for example, and I try to be honest and compassionate. But I’m a person who has very limited power and resources. Fundamentally, I just want to live my life, and I’m just doing that and it’s more than enough for me. After decades of torturous self-denial (and actual torture), it’s so wonderful just to exist as my true self, to just go do normal ordinary things like going to the store and going to parties at friends’ houses. It’s not everything my life *could* have been or *should* have been, but it’s what I have. My child might have a better life than me (I hope) or it might be far worse because people who are much more powerful than I will ever be are fucking everything up and turning the world to evil. Whatever. It’s way above my pay grade. I’m just being as happy as I can while I can.",1554063329,"i try to do my best to make it more likely to occur; i try to teach my child to be a good person, for example, and i try to be honest and compassionate.","honest and compassionate","compassionate",NA,FALSE,"honest and compassionate","honest",NA,NA,0

"ejlxly4","This is so hard, man!

I usually have a three way tie (Superman, Dick Grayson, and Zatanna) but if I had to pick only one it'd be....Dick Grayson.

Dick has one of the most compelling, unique stories in all of comics. We've watched him grow and the decisions he makes and the paths he takes are actually logical and in direct correlation with his influences and experiences, all of which we got to experience with him.

IMO, Grayson's story is one of the best long form narratives out there, and it was all done by accident 😅. Writers just built on the story one after another until it became a path of natural progression that has remained interesting for 79 years (or just 78, 2019 has been a bummer for the character so far).

Dick doesn't need huge personality over hauls to make his character appealing (which is why Ric is so unappealing😒...). He doesn't need tropes or gimmicks to make most of his character work. In fact, he usually defies them.

He's a hero without being a boyscout. He's optimistic but not naive. He's hopeful but practical, kind and compassionate but still discerning.

He has all the skills to be Batman, but doesn't feel the need to parade them around likes he's better than everyone else (like Batman does).

Dick is a nice mix of dark and light: a character who can be intense and lighthearted, kind and dangerous, fun but still with enough angst to be grounded.  But above all else, Dick Grayson is an imperfect character. He's allowed to fall, fail, make mistakes and bad decisions. But he learns from them, he does what he can to fix things. He picks himself up and he keeps moving.  

Yes, his story is fantastical but his incredibly human personality makes it interesting and relatable to me.

That's what I like most about Dick Grayson and why he's my favorite, he's multidimensional and complex without having to whine about how complicated he is. Just like us, he has strengths and weaknesses and ups and downs but he's always trying to be better and do better and that's really inspirational and realistic at the same time. 

Sorry again for the length of this post. You ask about one of my favs and I just talk your ear off 😅.

You may want to consider a suicide loss survivor support group. 

And therapy is work. It’s two kinds of work, it’s work in finding the right therapist, and it’s work once you’re in therapy with the right therapist. So many people have the mistaken belief that they will get into therapy and get better after a few sessions. It took me a few years of working with a therapist I did have a good repertoire with to start to dig out of a hole I didn’t understand I was in before my husband’s suicide. Which incidentally helped me deal with his suicide, by preparing me to understand that it wouldn’t be my fault if it happened. (We didn’t know he was suicidal, but it was a fear of mine even though he never admitted to being suicidal. He had serious mental health issues, and it helped so much to see I was not responsible for his choices and I could be supportive and compassionate, but I could not or should not try to “fix him”.)

And I’m still doing a ton of work now. I’m not currently in therapy for reasons (mostly money), but I do a lot of mental health self study to the best of my ability. It doesn’t replace therapy, but it is something I can do for myself in the interim. I consider it a life long process. After all, it has been my entire life that fucked me up. And I don’t want to get better, I want to do better. 

I have two concrete recommendations- 

1) get and read the book “The Body Keeps Score” Which is a book on trauma. It will be a difficult read. Do it anyway. 

2) grab your phone, a pair of earbuds with a mic, go for a walk and start recording a voice memo. Just talk to yourself about what you’re feeling. It doesn’t matter if you listen to them later or not. Sometimes it’s helpful, and sometimes it’s not. But make sure you walk. Don’t worry about what people think or see, they’ll just assume you’re on a call or making notes to yourself (which you are!) 

Your hurt is real. Losing your friend is horrible, something that few others will understand. You won’t ever forget or stop missing him. But it will hurt less with time.

I do not know a lot about Jordan Peterson but I remember one video of his in which he was asked to comment on Islam and he refrained from offering an assertive opinion due to his inability to put his thoughts in order and lack of compressive knowledge in the subject.

"ej690jx","I’m guessing that you haven’t been together for very long yet (since she still lives with her mom and you two don’t usually share finances). My answer would be no - you don’t have to pay for her pet’s surgery. 

Most people don’t share finances until they marry or at least start living together. The two of you clearly aren’t at that stage yet. At this point, the two of you have no say over each other’s money. 

Furthermore, she needs to realize that pets are expensive. Their health care is expensive. Their insurance is expensive. If she can’t afford to pay for her chinchilla (or even give it a suitable space to stay), then she really shouldn’t keep it. You’re being kind to the chinchilla by opening a credit account for her. Be aware that she might struggle to pay you back, and your credit could take a hit.

All this being said, she’s probably distraught from her pet’s health condition. It’s easy to slip into “someone I love is suffering, why aren’t you doing anything?” So be compassionate but firm.

"eimq0av","This is a very common belief that I’ve noticed in this fandom, but it has problems. Everyone is looking at it from a very shallow, a very *mortal* view. A view that I actually see in real life when talking about real-world religion. You can’t really look at a deity’s perspective from a mortal point of view.

To summarize, the gods did nothing wrong and it’s all salem’s fault.

The gods seem to embody two sides of a coin. I can see how you could see the GoD as petty and jealous, because that’s what he’s supposed to embody. He embodies negativity, darkness, evil, and *chaos*. While the GoL is supposed to embody the opposite; positivity, light, good, and *order* (I’ll emphasize chaos vs order more, because it plays a part in my belief that they didn’t do anything wrong.) I’m not quite sure how the GoL came off as hypocritical and self righteous to you though. All of his actions display kindness and compassion. He is sympathetic to Salem’s wish to bring her dead love back, even though he won’t for reasons I’ll get into in a second. And when his brother is about to punish humanity and Salem, he looks away. The GoL was kind and compassionate, but stern too. Like a parent.

As for why he wouldn’t grant salem’s wish, there’s a very simple explanation to all of that. The GoL embodies order. He refused to bring ozma backbecsuse resurrecting the dead defies the natural order of life and death and how the two coexist in a delicate balance, and even tried to explain that to Salem (which she disregards.) the GoD embodies chaos, so he has no problem defying the natural order to resurrect the dead, especially when you stroke his ego.

**Now here’s why this whole mess is completely Salem’s fault**

When Ozma kicks the bucket, Salem goes to the GoL to bring him back to life. Understandable, he’s an all-powerful god. He kindly refuses on the basis of not disturbing the delicate balance between life and death, which he is supposed to uphold as the god of light/order. And instead of understanding and accepting that Ozma is dead, she throws a tantrum like she’s never been told “no” before, prompting the GoL’s stern response: “Let. Him rest.” Not being one to take “no” for an answer, she goes to his brother behind the GoL’s back to try again. She strokes his ego and he obliges. The GoL finds out and goes to uphold the natural order, and almost gets I to a fight with the GoD over it. Once they both figure out that Salem played them, they turn on her. The gods curse her with immortality “until she learns the value of life and death” (paraphrasing.) Understandable punishment with an easy way out. Instead of taking a step back and learning her lesson, she continues to spite the gods and rallies humanity against the gods, which results in the kingdoms of remnant declaring war against the gods. They respond by wiping out humanity, which had just literally tried to fight them. And not even being the only person left in the world could get her to admit that she was wrong, which leads to Ozma being given the task to unite humanity and prove to the gods that they deserve another chance. The GoL wanted to give humanity another chance. And now here we are.

Now I could be biased because I’m religious, so I’m used to stories like this and can understand the reasons why, but that’s my take.

TLDR the gods embody opposite aspects that define their character, and act based on those characteristics. Salem was in the wrong because she was too proud to admit she can’t comprehend the concept of death.",1552697309,"the gol was kind and compassionate, but stern too.","kind and compassionate","compassionate",NA,FALSE,"kind and compassionate","kind",NA,NA,0

"ei4mwhh","NAH, my friend, and I dearly hope you read that and understand what I am about to say. Everyone else, it seems, is bejng far too harsh in you, but that does not absolve you from having an incredible responsibility upon you now. You have a crossroads ahead of you, that will determine beyond much else the course of your life.

That responsibility isn’t necessarily raising the child, but deciding what to do. 
Abandon your gut response. That is based upon fear, and you can catch it before it does more harm, unlike others I have advised.

You - and her, she is as culpable as you are - have already done the damage. The child is concieved, and she is keeping it. Alright. You now need to stop. Calm down. Think things through.

For one, are you entirely certain your parents won’t kick you out anyhow, once they learn of it, whether you break up with her or not? For another, however, will you be able to live with yourself if you leave her? You haven’t been with her long, but I can tell you this; when I myself held my niece in my arms, I felt a love like no other, overwhelming and all-encompassing. I can’t imagine what that feeling would be for the father himself, no matter how terrifying if might also be.

So I can’t offer a concrete solution, as much as I wish I could. But I can say this;

It is not by our circumstances, but by how we react to them, that our worth is shown.

Are you going to fold in the face of adversity, or will you stand strong against the tides of fate? You have already invoked the first freedom, the freedom to take the consequences of your actions, but unlike so many you have a chance now to decide for yourself what those consequences are, so what will you make them?

I know this is painful, and scary, and seems impossible, but I’m only two years older than you are, and my sister has a child of her own I help with, so in two ways I can say; I understand, more than most here will, or that you can believe they will. Experience guides me here.

I say this in all goodwill, and to offer a compassionate but honest outsider’s view, in a better setting than a public thread; PM me. A public thread is not the place for this kind of decision-making, and a more one-on-one conversation will help far more, alright?

"ei3rgpy","Oh boy, this is my specialty.

I've had three long term relationships each with unique problems, I don't go seeking girls with illnesses but apparently they seek me.

The first girl had severe depression. Every day she would have something new to hate about herself and I would be there to convince her it wasn't a big deal, as well as threaten to kill herself whenever something didn't go her way. I suppose I put up with that longer than I should have, but I'm not one to give up. After several years she broke up with me to be with someone who physically abused her. The last thing she told me was that she never cared about any of my hobbies and interests and only was with me because I gave her confidence. I guess I deserved that one. Her parents were cool though and I still miss her dads BBQ.

The second girl had quite pronounced back scoliosis, and fibromyalgia. I would often take time off work to stay home with her and help her deal with her pain. She was very kind and compassionate but once she started smoking weed to manage her pain it led to her completely flipping that around. She started saying things like before she was smoking she didn't have a personality, and that this is who she really is now. She cheated on me, they got married, had a kid, and then divorced all within a year. I don't know how I could have handled this one differently, she became a different person before my eyes in such a short amount of time. Just glad I dodged that bullet, I guess.

The last girl I was with also had chest scoliosis as well as epilepsy, but I didn't know any of this until we started going out. I met her at work and when we first started texting I thought she was underage with how she messaged and with the amount of emojis she used, but it turns out she was in her late 20s. She was very a sweet girl, and very sheltered by her parents. Epilepsy is a scary thing, watching someone you care about lose complete control of their body and act like it's completely natural, but I learned what I needed to do in those situations and took care of her the best I could. She ended up suddenly dying during a particularly bad episode. Even though she's gone I don't regret it one bit, she was always so happy and grateful to have me around and knowing people like her can exist still brings hope to my life.

TL;DR Everyone has their flaws, people with illnesses have just more obvious ones. They will look to you for support, but some might expect it just because that's what they've been given their whole life. An all give relationship can lead you to be taken for granted or worse, taken advantage of. Know and understand her illness, especially how it might affect her later in life. Take care to build a good relationship with her parents because they care about her well being just as much as you do. And don't get too upset when your plans don't go to... plan.

"ei1i29l","&gt; Does your experience of Zen Buddhism match mine?

Not really and I've practice with communities of Zen Buddhism, Chan Buddhism, and Seon Buddhism. 

&gt; Do you think it is about as beneficial as possible? If it is not, can you help me be understanding of it?

Can you rephrase the questions. I don't know what you are asking.

&gt; There was no objective. 

Except Zen buddism as a tradition probably has some of strongest emphasis on meditation. You can say a core objective of Zen is:  **""Meditate!** And maybe only slightly less strong in emphasis, embody your Buddha-nature now and  practice, practice, practice. 

&gt; The nun that guided me had decades of experience and had read several books. But she still said phrases like ""It takes the entire life to have positive thoughts. We kill with our thoughts"". Even then I immediately got the feeling that she wasn't advanced. Nowadays I can tell that it's possible to have almost perfectly ethical and positive thoughts really early in life.

Does she live a virtuous life? If not, then maybe you might be on to something. If she does live a virtuous life, be open to what she might be able to teach you. Also don't be so sure you know what she is talking about. It can take time to disambiguate what someone means.

&gt; There was barely any Dharma. Just general instructions about posture and occasional unstructured tips like ""Don't hold any intention or goal"" or ""We are always beginners"".

Except those are some really great practice instruction. There is a lot to gain from practicing in this manner.  Another great practice instruction to give is to learn and practice the precepts. My experience with Zen is that they also really emphasize the precepts and the Bodhisatva vow. All of that is pretty core to following the dharma. Sadly, I notice that some Buddhists dont spend enough time actually practicing the noble 8-fold path and spend maybe too much time trying to intellectualize the Dharma.

&gt; Socially it was cold. **Somehow it was compassionate, but very strict and blunt.**

Interesting choice of words. Cold generally means lacking of compassion, but you point out there was obviously some compassion in it. Culturally there are some elements of Zen that can be off-putting. For one they really do emphasize less talking/noble silence. If you continue you with the practice you may develop a taste for the deep bonds that be formed and communicated through silence. 

Now the following is from the Kwan Um School of Zen which is somewhat different from Japanese Zen, but I'm sure the basics still apply:

&gt; Student: What is the difference between our practice together and our individual practice later on at home?

&gt; Zen Master Joeng Hye: This time of practicing together is something special. You can say this time is like potatoes banging against one another in water. Everyone who practices in this school knows this teaching of potatoes. We are all like potatoes in a pot. When we practice it is like a stick stirring the potatoes and then the potatoes start to work on one another and the cleaning goes faster. So when we are here we learn from one another. Individual practice is not enough. We are too young for individual practice—of course I am only joking a bit, because individual practice is important too. But when we only practice individually, it is difficult to see our limitations and our karma, the karma of our mind. The sangha is like a mirror, in which you can easily see your limitations, the limits of your actions and your opinions.

&gt; To awaken our original mind we have to go beyond our likes and dislikes, because our mind is always looking around and sniffing out what it likes and dislikes, but the things we like are not necessarily good for us, and the things we dislike are not necessarily bad for us. When you are here you have no choice—then your mind of likes and dislikes appears. It is easy to see—many people have problems with it. I’m sure you have found many things that you don’t like here. Do you like to get up at half past four?

"ei1648f","&gt;Does your experience of Zen Buddhism match mine?

Yes.

&gt;Do you think it is about as beneficial as possible?

That depends.

&gt;It takes the entire life to have positive thoughts.

Zen's standards are a little high in that regard. After all Zen is a little different sometimes. It sees itself as a transmission beyond words and concepts (or something like that, I forgot the exact words...)

When we see the world from the point of view of a tradition whose Dharma goes beyond words and concepts, what's a positive thought?

&gt;Nowadays I can tell that it's possible to have almost perfectly ethical and positive thoughts really early in life.

That might not be exactly what was meant here. Yes, thoughts which your mind confirms as ""ethical"" are positive thoughts. Thoughts which make you happy are positive thoughts. Thoughts which lead to good actions are positive thoughts. But usually all of that happens in a framework of concepts.

Are there positive thoughts that go beyond that? Zen says yes. That might be what was meant here.

&gt;There was barely any Dharma. Just general instructions about posture and occasional unstructured tips like ""Don't hold any intention or goal"" or ""We are always beginners"".

""When x happened, you said y and z.""  

Start with an example or two of your own relationship. Again, state his actions in objective terms. Then, take ownership of your own feelings. ""When x happened, you said y and z. This made me feel \[emotion\]."" 

Note that you don't say, ""you feel like you always have to be right."" Banish ""feel like"" from your vocabulary for this letter. ""This made me feel unheard and disrespected."" That sort of thing.

Ultimately, your husband is doing this because of insecurity. He's afraid that you (and others he respects) will judge him and think he's dumb or a fuck-up.  Throughout the letter, be kind and compassionate, but also firm.

"ehizay8","I think that theres a couple of issues with hollywood psychics. The first is that as fame increases a persons ego can increase, or get bigger, as well. The ego kinda holds you back from enlightenment, for lack of a better word, or a higher level of conciousness. Ideally someone would be able to give from the goodness of their heart and be genuine and compassionate- but we are all human and sometimes the pressure to perform or put on a show, as well as make money, can kind of take over. People who really were once really in touch can, in my opinion, fall out of touch with spirit or whatever you’d like to call it. They’re focused on the wrong things- material things. Of course we all need to make a living so in some ways I can understand it, but it really is out of touch with the whole point of being a reader. 
The second issue is that this is something where there is not a whole lot of definitive proof of either what the psychic is saying, or in some cases what the person receiving the reading is saying. Peoples emotional responses, on both ends, as well as just how the two people interact or vibe matters a lot. Some people approach readings with a pretty poor or offensive attitude- “perform for me &amp; you better prove you’re legitimate” kinda thing. This sort of starts the vibe off on the wrong foot. Maybe theres a good reason that person is so skeptical but anyone being approached like that is going to be thrown off a bit from time to time. I would think also that if you are on the spot in front of a crowd full of people and you’re flopping, its probably kind of embarrassing no matter who you are. Psychics are also human &amp; have flaws. Because of this I’m sure people react in not the greatest ways sometimes, like arguing with the person getting the reading. 
Lastly, unfortunately there’s also always going to be bad eggs in the bunch that want to ride the coat tails of others and take advantage. If you aren’t intuitive yourself or knowledgeable about psychic related things, it could be easy to fall for readings from one of these people which would then reinforce skepticism and maybe even some resentment/anger. That then leaves the legitimate readers fighting an uphill battle to prove something, which can be draining and frustrating.

"ehfq8k6","[The Coelux]

The Kohan have a very peculiar pantheon of deities that function in essence as two entirely seperate religions that share the same mythology, one monotheistic and one polytheistic; the Temple of Siah and the Temple of the Sisters.

The Temple of the Sisters, the older of the two religions, has 3 Gods that it worships; Yitha, Kare and Ominosa, the titular sisters.

• Yitha holds dominion over the Sky and the Sea, she is also responsible for consciousness, trade, gold, birds, fish, insects, fire. Although she also has a temperamental personality, kind one day and furious the next for seemingly no reason. She can call apon natural disasters of all kinds to smite those she dislikes or those simply unlucky enough to catch her eyre. She is primarily worshipped by Merchants, Fisherfolk and Mountaineers. Her symbol are two intertwined fish bisected by a bird with its wings spread, all made of gold.

• Kare holds dominion over the Earth and Nature, she is also responsible for war, disease, silver, plants, animals, reason, gemstones and medicine. Kare is much more melancholic and calm than Yitha, she is the 'straight man' of the sisters and speaks reason to the other two. She is primarily worshipped by Warriors, Scholars, Miners, Doctors and Farmers. Her symbol is a tree impaled by a sword made of silver and encrusted with gemstones.

• Ominosa holds dominion over Death and the Sun, she is also responsible for leadership, writing, copper, intrigue, entertainment and fun. Ominosa is the trickster of the three sisters, while possessing a good nature, caring for all those under her domain she has little remorse and will entertain herself by tricking mortals, spirits and gods alike. This is because she is responsible for the souls of the dead and thinks that as long as she cares for them in the afterlife she can abuse them to her hearts content. She is primarily worshipped by the Aristocracy. Her symbol is a radiating sun with a skull in the center made of copper.

The Three Sisters were primarily worshipped by the Kohan until very recently when a new deity inserted himself into the pantheon; Siah. 

• Siah holds dominion over Machines but is also credited (by his worshippers) as the architect of all life while the Three Sisters merely took credit for his work. This belief stems from his dominion also including machines of organic origin like the Human Body with all its organs that can be likened to a machine and by extension all life. Whether this is true or not is the subject of much theological debate in the modern day. Siah is compassionate but cold, he helps those who can help themselves and does not grant his gifts arbitrarily. His symbol is a cog with a heart in the center made of Steel.

Siah only recently joined the pantheon of the Kohan as he only revealed himself to the Prophet Prophina just 214 Years Ago. Despite this his worship is the most common in all Kohan since it was his gifts of Machinery that brought the Kohan out of their centuries of subjugation and entered them into a golden age of prosperity and expansion and his widespread worship is in thanks for this.

**BUT**

This is only partly true in reality and is only what the Kohan people believe. While the Gods are indeed real they claim far more is their doing then what is true. There are actually thousands of Gods across The Coelux each with their own Mythos and belief systems. Gods will often claim responsibility for things they did not do in order to achieve this Mythos and inspire worship. 

In reality; Yitha is only responsible for the existence of Gold. Kare only responsible for several kinds of disease, animal, medicine and plant. Ominosa is responsible only for the souls of the mortals that believe in her. And Siah is only responsible for Machines.

This however does not mean the Gods cannot invoke the abilities they claim to hold as all Gods across the Coelux are equally all-powerful and even a God of Sheep for instance can summon Lightning or create Islands. But they rarely break their own Mythos/Canon in fear of discouraging worship. I.e if someone saw the God of Sheep hurling lightning bolts they might become confused and skeptical.

"ehetwvi","I'm gonna be honest, based on the first few episodes and the trailers, I ***hate*** New Amsterdam. It paints the entire medical community in such a horrific and unrealistic light. It does nothing but pour oil on the flames of medical mistrust which is already dangerously pervasive. Think  about the kid with diabetes who died because his parents gave him essential oils instead of insulin because they ""didn't trust doctors"" for vague and unsubstantiated reasons. That's the real harm this kind of fearmongering can do. I am in NO way saying that our medical system is perfect- of course not. If it were possible, we'd do an overhaul from top to bottom and provide universal healthcare (though there is too much political opposition for that to happen right now). However, it doesn't help to create imaginary problems for imaginary Dr. Jesus to fight.   


And what trite fantasy it is. It's basically revenge porn for people  who don't like ""modern doctors"". Oh, you're gonna just *fire* every cardiothoracic surgeon in the hospital except one? How're you gonna, y'know... *treat patients who need CT surgery??* And look forward to getting a shit-ton of lawsuits because you arbitrarily fired surgeons without any review or room for improvement. What does it even mean, ""putting billing above patient care""?? You think the *doctors* are the ones who just *looooove* billing and coding? No! They're constrained by the demands of hospital and insurance protocol. Of *course* they'd rather just do what they want irregardless of cost, but who TF is gonna pay that bill? The patient out of pocket? The insurance? The hospital? The doctor? And what do you mean ""Let's be DOCTORS again!""? What the hell is ""TheY'Re NoT gONna LeT  yOu JUst HeLP PeOPle"" supposed to be telling us? You think doctors don't want to *help* people? What in the hell do they think doctors are doing out there?? And you know why we don't let doctors just do whatever FEELS right? Because doctor both doctor and patient intuition is *often not correct.*  That's why we have guides for best practice and thoroughly researched treatment regimens, so that it can take the guesswork out of medicine as much as possible and ensure the best possible outcome based on evidence-based research. A patient wants some random procedure that's not at all supported by research? Well then, their insurance won't cover it and it's to the doctor's discretion if they'll even do it, considering it may cause harm to the patient. Should we just DO all those procedures because the patient wants it? What if it's more likely to harm than to help? And again- who *pays* for it?? Is it ethical to force a patient ot pay out-of-pocket for a procedure that could harm them and has not been shown to help?   


Oh, and he's gonna just ""Get rid of the residents""?? Are you joking?? How are we going to train new doctors if they aren't allowed to practice while supervised?  Also, there's good evidence that having students and residents involved in patient care *improves* patient outcomes because there's just so much more attention paid to each patient. And he's gonna replace them with ""real doctors""- who the hell is going to pay the 4x higher salaries of those new doctors compared to residents? That's millions of dollars!  Where would the money *come* from? Especially considering apparently he's just arbitrarily not charging some patients.   


  
I guess what bothers me most is it's bringing in this fancy Jesus Doctor to ""fix all the problems in the hospital"". Sure his team has ""great doctors"" who are clearly empathetic and compassionate, but the problem there is they're clearly juxtaposed to what's supposed to represent *the entire rests of the medical community.* They're great and outstanding ONLY in the context of the rest of the doctors in the entire world being idiotic, money-grubbing, cold-hearted, unempethtic monsters. Do those kind of evil doctors exist? Sure. Are they the majority? Not by a LONG shot. It's unfair and damaging to doctors AND patients to represent them this way.  It justifies an irrational fear of doctors which runs in extreme of realistic concerns.   


Compare that to something like ""Scrubs"". Doctors made mistakes on that show, you had better doctors and worse doctors, and you had straight-up BAD doctors. There were flaws in the system. Sometimes patients didn't make it. There were frustrations about insurance and billing and charting and coding. But it didn't paint anyone in that hospital as being an inhuman monster.   


TLDR: New Amsterdam is revenge porn for people who think that all doctors are evil and want to see the system burn in a *totally* unrealistic manner. It dangerously and unrealistically fans the flames of medical mistrust. Fuck New Amsterdam.

OK, JK.  It's pretty accurate to the front I have IRL.  I didn't expect myself to subscribe to such a subreddit as this.

"eh4l8od","I'd like to say ""just ask them,"" but everyone knows that we're all morons and/or out of our goddamn minds in high school, so the ""just act like an adult"" route sadly may not be the right approach here. 

I think you're actually on the right track with the brownies and Starbucks. If a girl's upset but she won't tell you why, you're probably not going to get anywhere pestering her about it or trying to weasel out the reason. Just address her emotional distress as its own thing, and don't worry about the reason. Do things to cheer her up (the brownies and starbucks), offer distractions (suggest an opportunity to hang out with your friends, invite her to something fun, etc), and make yourself available to listen without pressuring her to talk (""hey, is everything ok? something you want to vent about?"" ""no"" ""okay, cool. I'm going to Chipotle for lunch, want to come with?"")

Basically you want to demonstrate that you noticed her distress and you're prepared to make her feel better, while letting her set the boundaries for if/how much she wants to engage with you. Be available and compassionate, but don't be pushy. 

This approach should really help if she's upset about something not related to you. On the other hand, if she's mad AT you, you may not get a great response at first.

* Approximately 6.5 million companion animals enter U.S. animal shelters nationwide every year. 
* Each year, approximately 1.5 million shelter animals are euthanized (670,000 dogs and 860,000 cats).

So that's 1.5 million animals that somehow magically get re-homed? Somebody has to put those animals down. Or would you prefer they suffer and die from illness and starvation?

As it happens, PETA does do [lots of spaying and neutering of animals](https://www.peta.org/about-peta/learn-about-peta/helping-animals-in-hampton-roads/snip/). Which is a part of the solution, along with advocating that pet owners spay and neuter their pets, which they also do.

"egclho6","As will be very evident, I've read this thread and all of the responses herein very carefully. As I read your responses, I became very confused about what is actually going on. There isn't that much description of what is physically occurring or not occurring within your current sex life, nor are there explicit examples of what you would like to see occurring, and the examples you give about the conversations you have inside and outside of the bedroom regarding your sex life are sort of vague and one-sided (like, ""I suggested X, but nothing changed,"" rather than, ""I suggested X, and he said Y, but the next time we had sex X didn't happen"").

Anyway, I've pulled out the material I thought was significant in your post and responses, and I began to feel less confused and instead found that I have a kind of working hypothesis for what might fundamentally be going askew.

Something that is confusing about this thread for me is that you never delineate whether there was a time in your relationship where these current issues (sex drive, initiative, intensity) didn't exist. In your post you write this:

&gt;i've naively consoled myself throughout the relationship with hope that things would improve.

which leads me to believe there has been a long passive phase in the issues you are experiencing, where you weren't actively addressing issues and were instead hoping things would organically improve. As a reader, this is problematic, because you never write anywhere about if and when your sex life was in good shape and what that looked like. u/hotmom_ma asks whether his drive has always been low or if it's circumstantial, but instead of telling us whether there was a time when it wasn't an issue, you delve into your own mental health and meds and then say that his seem to be fine. You never say whether his drive was better in the past nor do I see any descriptions anywhere of any the issues you are currently facing having not existed at one point in your relationship/marriage. So... was there a 'before?' Have these issues always existed? You offer some anecdotes of one off situations when the sex was good (the first time you had sex, after that one party, while on drugs), but you don't say whether or not there was a time, before this ""naive consolation"" phase, when the sex was consistently satisfying to you. The above quote *does* say ""throughout the relationship,"" so I'm inclined to think this has always been a problem area?

The main thing I noticed in going through what you've written is that there seems to be a real dearth of direct communication. You write:

&gt;I've tried talking about it, both with gentle suggestions and more direct communication. We are good at talking about it, but i find myself skirting around the hard truths that our sexy times are just not really turning me on. 

But U/JJturn asked
&gt;You've spelled it out pretty clearly here. Can you communicate it this clearly to him outside the bedroom?

To which you respond
&gt;Yeah, I've tried in subtle ways, but I haven't really say him down for the hard talk.

You also wrote the following, some of which I italicize to emphasize what I see as evidence that your communication is not clear and is in fact not ""direct communication,"" and I hope you will see the pattern that leads me to this conclusion:

&gt;Yeah it's *definitely* confidence and not knowing what to do, I *get that general sense*. And also that he has very low sex drive. You're right though, I think I need to be more explicit.

&gt;Yeah you're totally right. Communication is key. *Honestly this is the most I've ever communicated about sex before*. Partly because it's the worst situation I've been in, but also because we are fucking married and I'm determined to sort this shit out and explore every possible path to a solution.

&gt;*I know that directly saying that would just make things worse*. He *seems to be convinced* that the issue is purely physical, *I know he knows that there's more to it* than that, but *he doesn't really seem to bring it up*. I want to be sensitive, but *I'm also tired of skirting around the elephant in the room*. I realise that women's sexuality is complicated, I know that my difficulty with all this is something he's not entirely familiar with. I've tried to explain to him that sex is very psychological for me. It just *seems* like he doesn't really want to get into *the details of what's really going on.*

&gt;I just don't want to injure his confidence. *I don't want to explicitly tell him to research technique*, because I know if be gutted if the same was done to me. The frustrating thing though is that *he's not putting two and two together and doing it himself.*

&gt;God I wish it was that specific and kinky. *I don't even have any really specific kinks*, I just want to feel like the person I'm having sex with really wants to fuck the shit out of me. It's not complicated.

&gt;what you're saying is very popular advice on these types of subreddits, but *in reality I think this approach is too brutal*, especially about something as sensitive and sex. I'm just thinking if the situ was reversed, i wouldn't take that well.

Okay, so hopefully I've somewhat illustrated how as a reader I see a major issue with truly direct communication. When you write about him and his feelings and perspective, I get the pervasive sense that what you're writing is pretty much conjecture rather than ""this is what he said about X when I brought it up last time,"" and when you write about your side of communication, you say that you've made suggestions and mentioned things from the past that you enjoyed, but you simultaneously indicate that you don't want to be too direct in your approach because you're worried about his self-esteem, and you also say each and every time that those suggestions and indications don't pay off afterwards: it doesn't stick, as you say.

The thing is, as I was pulling out this material, I started to realize that you might be really heavily projecting your own sensitivities and self-esteem onto him, causing you to beat around the bush, instead of modifying your communication to be more like his, which seems to be very different from you own. You shared this

&gt;Sometimes he's too vocal and says shit that actually fucks me up, like the last time I ever really got super wet. I used to get really wet and squirt a little when I was excited. Straight after sex he suggested I go per beforehand so I don't make a mess. I was devastated because I thought it was sexy and I thought we both enjoyed it. He said he liked it, but I don't think he realised how self-conscious it makes me. Needless to say it doesn't happen anymore. I struggled getting wet at all now.

I'm definitely not going to say that I have never taken a comment from my partner completely the wrong way and felt really devastated by it in the moment or even for a few days afterwards, maybe even a week or two. But if my partner says something that either really rubs me the wrong way or absolutely crushes me, at some point in the nearest future possible (sometimes it takes me a couple of days or even weeks to decide whether or not it's water under the bridge for me or something where a conversation and closure are necessary), I sit him down and have a calm, compassionate, but direct conversation with him about it. The above gives me the impression that this wasn't addressed afterwards; you were just devastated, never recovered, and now you don't get wet anymore because you're self-conscious about it.

The thing is, I can see how his suggestion might come off as insensitive or a downer, but I don't really understand the magnitude of your reaction. When your emotions stabilized, maybe you could have brought it up, explaining that it hurt you and why? Or you could have explained that even if you pee before sex, you're still very productive? FWIW, I drive my partner crazy getting up to pee 1-5X during sex, because I'm a prodigious squirter, and giving myself the opportunity to ensure my bladder is completely empty often multiple times throughout sex helps give me peace of mind. Also, he SAID he liked it, and you thought that you both enjoyed you squirting and found it sexy. So you thought he liked it, and he said he liked it. The suggestion that you go to the bathroom may be misguided in its logic, but it's not as if he said it was gross or complained to you about the mattress or something directly shaming. You say in several of your posts that you don't communicate some things more directly because *you* are sensitive about sex stuff, and *you* would be upset (you even write ""gutted"") if he were to be too direct with *you* about the feelings which you are experiencing around these issues. Like here:

&gt;The challenge is that *I feel* that previous conversations with him about not being satisfied *may be impacting his confidence* as well. *I get the impression* that he's lost confidence because he feels clumsy. I know that I'm pretty sensitive myself about sex stuff. The problem is he says he's open to conversation, I tell him that something's not working and hears me but nothing really changes.",1550020487,"but if my partner says something that either really rubs me the wrong way or absolutely crushes me, at some point in the nearest future possible (sometimes it takes me a couple of days or even weeks to decide whether or not it's water under the bridge for me or something where a conversation and closure are necessary), i sit him down and have a calm, compassionate, but direct conversation with him about it.","compassionate, but direct","compassionate","but",TRUE,"compassionate , but direct","direct",NA,NA,1

"eg7vu2k","(In ancient Roman religion and myth, Janus (/ˈdʒeɪnəs/; Latin: IANVS (Iānus), pronounced [ˈjaː.nus]) is the god of beginnings, gates, transitions, time, duality, doorways,[1] passages, and endings. He is usually depicted as having two faces, since he looks to the future and to the past.) (etymology: indicated by Cicero, Ovid and Macrobius, which explains the name as Latin, deriving it from the verb ire (""to go"") is based on the interpretation of Janus as the god of beginnings and transitions.
Modern scholars have conjectured that it derives from the Indo-European root meaning transitional movement.)  

(Theology and functions: While the fundamental nature of Janus is debated, in most modern scholars' view the god's functions may be seen as being organized around a single principle: presiding over all beginnings and transitions.)

(As a god of motion, Janus looks after passages, causes actions to start and presides over all beginnings. Since movement and change are interconnected, he has a double nature, symbolized in his two headed image.) (In general, Janus is at the origin of time as the guardian of the gates of Heaven: Jupiter himself can move forth and back because of Janus's working.)

(A similar solar interpretation has been offered by A. Audin who interprets the god as the issue of a long process of development, starting with the Sumeric cultures, from the two solar pillars located on the eastern side of temples, each of them marking the direction of the rising sun at the dates of the two solstices: the southeastern corresponding to the Winter and the northeastern to the Summer solstice. These two pillars would be at the origin of the theology of the divine twins, one of whom is mortal (related to the NE pillar, as confining with the region where the sun does not shine) and the other is immortal (related to the SE pillar and the region where the sun always shines.) (diuum deus: god of the gods; ianitos: the Janitor, Gatekeeper.)

(When invoked along with other gods, usually only he is called pater.[73] For Janus the title is not just a term of respect; principally it marks his primordial role. He is the first of the gods and thus their father)

(Patulcius and Clusivius or Clusius are epithets related to an inherent quality and function of doors, that of standing open or shut. Janus as the Gatekeeper has jurisdiction over every kind of door and passage and the power of opening or closing them.)

(It is a noteworthy curiosity that the opening of the Janus was perhaps the last act connected to the ancient religion in Rome: Procopius writes[208] that in 536, during the Gothic War, while general Belisarius was under siege in Rome, at night somebody opened the Janus Geminus stealthily, which had stayed closed since the 390 edict of Theodosius I that banned the ancient cults. Janus was faithful to his liminal role also in the marking of this last act.)

(the articulation Ianus-Ianitores could be interpreted as connected to the theologem of the Gates of Heaven (the Synplegades) which open on the Heaven on one side and on Earth or the Underworld on the other.)

(he ancient Sumerian deity Isimud was commonly portrayed with two faces facing in opposite directions. Sumerian depictions of Isimud are often very similar to the typical portrayals of Janus in ancient Roman art.[245] Unlike Janus, however, Isimud is not a god of doorways. Instead, he is the messenger of Enki, the ancient Sumerian god of water and civilization)

(hey include the Indian goddess Aditi who is called two-faced as she is the one who starts and concludes ceremonies,[252] and Scandinavian god Heimdallr. The theological features of Heimdallr look similar to Janus's: both in space and time he stands at the limits. His abode is at the limits of Earth, at the extremity of Heaven; he is the protector of the gods; his birth is at the beginning of time; he is the forefather of mankind, the generator of classes and the founder of the social order. )

(In Act I Scene 2 of Shakespeare's Othello, Iago invokes the name of Janus after the failure of his premiere plot to undo the titular character. As the story's primary agent of change, it's fitting that Iago align himself with Janus. His schemes prompt the beginning of each of the main characters' ends: in his absence, Othello and Desdemona would likely have remained married and Cassio would have remained in his respected position of power. Iago guides (if not forces) the story through inception, climax, and finale. Furthermore, Janus' common two-faced depiction is the perfect visual metaphor for Iago's character. Othello's characters believe him to have only the best of intentions, even going as far as to call him ""honest Iago,"" completely unaware that he spends every unwatched second plotting their undoing. He appears selfless and compassionate but, in truth, is power-hungry, amoral, and without regard for the well-being of others)

"efwdesm","A few talking points.

Safer than smoking doesn't mean 100% safe. Nicotine is a stimulant, stimulants can increase your heart rate, affect sleeping patterns all sorts of things (same goes for caffeine), there is some evidence that stimulants can lead to delayed brain development (again same for caffeine most pop is bad for children).

Nicotine can be addictive and for many a life long addiction, does he want to have to maintain nicotine levels for the rest of his life? I should point out pod systems like Juul have an insanely high amount of nicotine.

We're all guinea pigs here myself included, while studies for things like toxins aren't showing anything to worry about (extremely low levels of exposure to anything found and below any work safety requirements) vaping has only been on the market for about a decade, it could be another 20 years before we see issues arise in people that never smoked but vape, there just isn't enough non smokers who vape that have been doing it for long enough to get a good grasp on it.


Safe use, this really depends on what type of device he's using, if he's using a simple pod mod system like a Juul or Vype they are relatively safe as in they shouldn't *blow up* aka vent their batteries due to improper maintenance because they won't have access to the batteries, if they are using a device that uses external batteries eg: a vape that makes big clouds things are a bit different when it comes to safety, if you know the type of device and it is the type where you put batteries in (think big AA's) I'll drop a link to a battery safety guide.

"efv3fmg","I wholeheartedly believe that it is possible. But you need to garner a deep understanding of the problem. I will copy an older post of mine to back my claim and personal methodology in how I tackled this issue myself:
______________________________________________________________________________________

""If you don't mind, I can tell you a story about my experience with early-life insecurity.

Alot of problems with insecurity can be dissolved later in life, but some need the right training. Me personally, I thought about this for very long and chose a specific party where I did something that tremendously helped me with my validation seeking insecurity.

I wanted to be kind like always, but actively avoided reactions. I did this as a first attempt to break the habit. So I acted like a ping-pong ball that bounced through the house and tried to amuse myself (a few beers sure helped with this haha).

*Socialize, walk away. Compliment, walk away. Hand a beer to someone, walk away. Make eye contact across the room and smile, walk away. Help clean up a spilled drink, smile, walk away.*

The way I got preceived by everyone was staggering for me later that night. People wanted to hang out, danced with me, complimented me. Not because I asked for it, but because I profiled myself as enigmatic and a source that provided unconditional social and emotional value. That night truly opened my eyes to how people function socially. It's a supply and demand sort of thing. Because your conveyed emotions are always positive and compassionate, but limited and evenly distributed. So everyone eventually starts flocking to you to try and get more of your limited supply. They start seeking validation from you.

Ofcourse this isn't a thing to keep doing in day-to-day life. But it helps you break habits that are engrained in your deepest behavioural patterns, as well as give you a perspective about how people function socially and view you as a person.""

______________________________________________________________________________________

"efrjcwv","#**READ ALL OF THIS I DARE YOU**

&gt; How old are you? What's your gender? Give us a general description of yourself.

22 years old and male. I don't feel 22 at all, however. I kinda just feel like a child who's somehow fooled everyone into thinking that I'm an adult. People seem to relate to this a lot when I tell them. Also people will always guess that I'm either at least three years older or three years younger than I actually am, based on voice, appearance, and demeanor. It's felt like a self-fulfilling prophecy ever since the first time I pointed that out.

Other than that I generally just let people make their own conclusions on who I am over time as they get to know me, and I'm totally not saying that because I can't give a good answer on my own.

&gt; Is there a medical diagnosis that may impact your mental stability somehow?

It's possible I may be somewhere on the spectrum or that I have ADD, but nothing conclusive right now.

&gt; Describe your upbringing. Did it have any kind of religious or structured influence? How did you respond to it?

Back and forth between a compassionate but overprotective mother, and a dad who isn't all that aware of who I am emotionally but still tries his absolute best to make me and keep me happy anyway. My dad is very religious and when I lived with him would go to Sunday mass, but my mom is only vaguely religious, more spiritual than anything, and is actually skeptical of today's religious culture. My mom is pretty laissez-faire with me and my dad is too to some extent, and each of the partners that they've had serve as equalizers to them and would impose structure on my life however they saw fit. I would generally complain and be fussy about it when I was little, but now see it as a necessary foundation for keeping myself and my life together. I'm not always good at keeping structure in my life, but I still see it as the ideal and try to keep my life together in a way that most people would see as stereotypically ""having one's shit together,"" healthy eating and to do lists and all that jazz.

&gt; What do you do as a job or as a career (if you have one)? Do you like it? Why or why not?

I'm working on a Master's in Bioengineering, and would really love to get into designing therapies and devices for tissue engineering and, recently, 3D bioprinting. Essentially, it's growing tissues out of a small sample of either a patient's own cells, or someone else's, to replace faulty tissue. For instance, if you need some stomach lining or blood vessels replaced, we could grow replacements for you in a lab! Ideally, one should also be able to grow whole functioning organs, but there's still a long way to go before the industry develops technologies and procedures which consistently produce these organs.

I think it's really cool technology and I'm glad I chose bioengineering for my career, but I still get that feeling of wondering whether I chose the right career path or not. I have many interests, which include music, game development, chemistry, etc. and I always wonder how different my life would be if I had chose those paths instead, but then conclude that any industry will have its problems, obstacles, and moments of heavy disillusionment, so I try not to get wrapped up in what things could have been. I also constantly worry about whether or not I'll actually be good at what I do or desirable by any companies in bioengineering, even though I do well in my classes and have a few design projects under my belt.

&gt; If you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed?

I'd ultimately be fine with it. I'm prone to boredom and struggle to develop the mental energy to get started even on things like video games or tv shows, so I'll often spend periods of time where I'm either just dicking around reading articles online, Wikipedia pages, or YouTube, or just laying in bed with my thoughts. I've kind of concluded that no matter what I do with my free time, I'll never feel satisfied enough with what I've done, so I should just do whatever thing that will provide the most memorable experience. *alllllll* that to say that I would feel refreshed if I needed refreshing, but am prone to bouts of loneliness otherwise....actually that's not even the decent clear answer I was hoping for.... shit.....

&gt; What kinds of activities do you prefer? Do you like, and are you good at sports? Do you enjoy any other outdoor or indoor activities?

I do a lot of cooking, programming, music (play piano, improvising and arranging on the spot, and also have a few of my own compositions), and most forms of visual entertainment. I have tried several times to get into sports but I just... can't. I can't even get into *eSports,* I mean I at least thought that since it's video games and not ball sports that I could get invested into teams and sick plays and *nope I actually am so bored with it.* As for outdoor activities, I enjoy hiking and taking walks in general, as well as biking from time to time.

&gt; How curious are you? Do you have more ideas then you can execute? What are your curiosities about? What are your ideas about - is it environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate?

I tend to go down rabbit holes where I research things for hours on end that can normally be traced back to *some* source of inspiration or root thought. MBTI is another one of those rabbit holes, where the surface of the hole was just googling (for whatever reason) ""what kind of person am I?"" and then I slowly slipped back into MBTI after having taken the test at previous scattered points in my life. Other recent curiosities of mine have included minerals and gemstones, music theory, theories of randomness and probability, and core narrative and game design principles.

I have melodies and bits of music that loop in my head that I jot down occasionally. I've had a few ideas for games that I develop for periods at a time, visualizing their graphics, animations, mechanics, and aesthetics. One is a smash-esque fighting game with a fantasy kitchen sink of original characters, some of which are part of a fictional universe I've been developing since the 6th grade. Another is a random bullet hell pattern generator that I'm actually hoping to wrap up soon! A lot of other ideas are developed on the spot mid-conversation, and often forgotten about once the conversation ends, sadly. 

&gt; Would you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?

I have a tendency to become the leader of whatever group I'm a part of, for whatever reason. I'm usually the one designating tasks and roles, and suggesting ideas to move forward with a solution or to improve the team's communication. That being said, it's not really my ideal. It can be fun at times, and I would prefer being the leader of my own group to being the subordinate of an overbearing, bossy leader, but the best case scenario for me would involve me being the subordinate of a more understanding and flexible individual, while still having a largely rational approach.

&gt; Are you coordinated? Why do you feel as if you are or are not? Do you enjoy working with your hands in some form? Describe your activity?

Even though I can display coodination through abilities such as playing piano, cooking, and games requiring precise timing and inputs, I still just don't feel like I'm all that coordinated. I'm a clumsy person in general, and am prone to bouts of absent-mindedness, and yet when I focus I can work pretty well with my hands.

&gt; Are you artistic? If yes, describe your art? If you are not particular artistic but can appreciate art please likewise describe what forums of art you enjoy. Please explain your answer.

I would say so. I compose music from time to time (mostly chiptunes but occasionally more electronic pieces/snippets) and also have a handful of drawings and poems that I've done. As previously mentioned, I also like to improvise on the piano and make arrangements of popular songs, or songs from other media, on the spot. I would say a lot of it is pretty amateur, but we are our own harshest critics so it might not be as bad as I dread it is.

&gt; What's your opinion about the past, present, and future? How do you deal with them?

The past is the past! At least, that's what I like to think. Sometimes it resurfaces in my mind and bites me in the butt, like all people, but I generally don't even care enough about it to give it all that much thought. I do get small bouts of intense nostalgia, however, and sometimes it will manifest as 2 AM internet clickfests through every song or game I vaguely recognize from when I was 7, for example.
I'd love to live more in the present, but I'm usually too stuck in my own mind to care. I tend to think a lot about scenarios that might never happen, sometimes good but usually awful. Sometimes these scenarios give me a lot of anxiety and I have to find ways to dissociate from them. I always entertain myself by thinking of different timelines created by my own decisions, and consider all the possible ways in which a situation can play out, and their probabilities.

&gt; How do you act when others request your help to do something (anything)? If you would decide to help them, why would you do so?

I'm usually wary of what they're about to ask, but most of the time it ends up fine. I usually try to do whatever help is asked from me immediately, unless it's related to school or work, in which case I'm a heavy procrastinator in general. More personal matters and I'll be there! If they're already close to me it doesn't matter what they'd ask me to do, but if it's someone who's not as close to me then I have to really evaluate what they're asking of me so I know whether or not they're trying to use me.

"ef83aok","Damn. First off, I'm again sorry for what you're going through. If only on a technical level, sniffing that is absolutely killing his nose. Acetaminophen is so harsh on those delicate tissues that I'd honestly be prone to believe he hasn't been sniffing them for too long. The pain alone from sniffing that much volume of powder that's mostly acetaminophen suggests a kind of naivte. The kind that might lend a bit of credibility to what he's saying about it being just the beginning of his foray into the world of opiates. 

I know that's not much help, but I'd approach this situation with compassion and realism. He can't keep doing what he is doing with a wife and baby at home. Ultimatums rarely work unless you're willing to see then through without wavering, and given the fact that you're a new mom in such a situation, I'd advise against offering ultimatums. 

Instead, focus a bit on yourself and be selfish for a moment. How can you get your ducks in a row so as to enable you to thrive regardless of whether he gets help? And once you get those practical/financial and emotional support systems in place, you can begin to think about supporting him through this. From what you're describing, he's not being a direct physical threat to the family. He's a high dad and a high husband. He's a guy who fell, not some volatile animal who gets erratic and insane when under the influence. He's just not his best right now, and while that's not ideal, it offers you a lot of leeway in taking time to care for yourself during the time it'll take for him to come around to getting clean. 

It might take him a while. He can go to rehab tomorrow or in a year. He can get clean for a few days and slip up. He could put in the proper work it takes to detox and to stay clean for a lifetime, but realistically it takes several tries before we get it right. All these things are on him. His recovery will start when he wants it to. But your recovery starts now. 

Seek out support from anyone you can who is able to empathize without judgement, and most of all channel the strength within yourself to get through this in a way where your state of mind and being are in your control, and not in the control of his addiction. Be compassionate but selfish. Arm yourself with information without losing sight of the fact that your husband is not just some addict, but a man you love and care about who has gotten himself into a bit of a bind. But not one he can't fix. So have hope, but don't be blinded by it. That's as much as an enabling factor as is the misguided ""tough love"" approach, which so often ends up pushing addicts to a rock bottom that ends up getting them in a place worse than they'd otherwise ever be.

&gt; So we can see God become more compassionate and merciful after Jesus was sent to delegate for humanity since God can't understand the sinful mind. 

Why would you believe in a God who cant understand His own creation? How can you make that leap of faith for a God who isn’t All Knowing, All Wise, The Most Powerful? Doesn’t it make more sense God, One who has no Creator or origin is knowledgeable of all things? And of those things His Creation???

&gt; We also see no prophecy of Muhammad or anything like that. 

??? He was definitely prophesied. Jesus himself said there will be a messenger after him and he referred to Muhammad pbuh as Ahmed. The Jews had the Torah at that time and were aware of the prophecies but thought he would come from them because they think they are the “Chosen people” and refused to believe in him because he didn’t come from Bani Israel. 


&gt; Jesus was not violent and did not spread his message with the sword.

Nor did Prophet Muhammad pbuh. What is this mischaracterization smh. 

&gt; But why then send the message to a man who couldn't read or write?

The Quran isn’t written scripture. It’s the word of God. From God to Gabriel to Prophet Muhammad. It was finally recorded and organized properly into a book in the third Caliphate after his death. 

&gt; Why was it given to a man that was already 40 years old?  

Is this detail seriously a point of doubt? What if he was baby in his crib who spoke likeJesus did? You’d say the same thing. 

&gt; To me the Quran is nothing more than a man trying to get ahead in life and using his already gained wealth to become a god and gain power. 

Again you’re wrong. He lost his wife’s financial support when she died. He lived a very poor life of struggle afterwards. He was offered wealth, power, and women from others so he can stop spreading his message of One God but he refused. He literally said, “ ""O my uncle! by God if they put the sun in my right hand and the moon in my left on condition that I abandon this course, until God has made me victorious, or I perish therein, I would not abandon it."" If they offered him the world he would not stop spreading his message and will continue to death. He was never after the superficial aspects of this life. 

&gt;  It just doesn't make sense for God to send Jesus and then send such a contrasting individual like Muhammad.

Absolutely. You have terribly mischaracterized Prophet Muhammad to the point where you’re speaking of another individual. Why do you keep saying he killed? You’re absolutely demonizing the battles of self defense initiated by the disbelievers. God tells us to be merciful and compassionate but not complacent pushovers. 

&gt; I also don't think that it is fair for Muslims to say that the Bible is corrupted and the Quran is not even though we know without a doubt that the Quran was not written as Muhammad recited it (conveniently once again) and in fact wasn't written down until years after his death.

I honestly don’t understand what you’re getting at here. Everyone knows the editing and rewriting the Bible and it’s parts went through. The Quran though was memorized by all many of the believers and once it was written down properly and copied not a single letter has been changed. Any attempt is well known and distinguishable from the Quran. But yeah if you want to to believe the Quran is corrupted too to downplay the miracle of its perseverance go ahead. It’s not like you believe it’s Gods final words to mankind anyways. 

&gt; This compilation was taken and finalized by Uthman and the previous version burned. 

??? You are either incredibly misinformed or pulling facts out of air to create a false history to discredit the incredible accurate perseveration of the Holy Quran. What previous version was burned? It was one massive project taken by Zayd bin Thabit and other assistants under-the order of Uthman ibn Affan. There was no previous compilation “burned” whatsoever. 


&gt; We can also see that the earliest compilations of the Bible are around the 4th century and the Quran didn't come around until late 7th early 8th century.

Well yes. Because Jesus came with the Bible a few generations before Prophet Muhammad. 


&gt; All religions have issues but if we look at Jesus actions and words we can see that he is the Truth.

When you says all religions have issues are you excluding Christianity? Why is God ignored and almost inferior to Jesus? 😭😭😭 this is why I’m low key frustrated. I completely understand why Christians love Jesus and his message. They are inclined to the truth in Christianity. But Islam contains all that plus the ultimate truth of our creation and our Creator (One God), our purpose in life, and where we’re headed. We are not guilty of anything but we will definitely be held accountable individually for our wrong doings on this Earth. Ain’t no Jesus saving Hitler or us.

However, what I saw wasn't in any way shocking, nor did it challenge my outlook of walkers simply being nothing more than the empty shells of former people that are now 'monsters', and that they react to sound. So far I've yet to see anything that has remotely challenged this notion, including this scene.

Ultimately I see James as being a caring and compassionate but completely deluded individual. He's just wearing his trauma in a slightly more nonsensical manner than some of the other character (granted, having been brought up as a Whisperer amongst other things would probably have that effect). Right now he strikes me as an obvious example of someone who thought they'd found their calling, rejected those teachings thereafter, and has since been on a long, personal voyage of trying to find himself - including what he believes beyond basic morality. He's a very lost individual. I see this particular belief then as being nothing more than an extension of that ""voyage"". I respect his right to hold those belief though had to call him out when prompted for my own opinion. To me this is comparable with a heavily religious person claiming something along the lines of ""I was sitting there and suddenly became overwhelmed by this sense of peace and love, and at that moment I knew that God existed"". Just because you feel something doesn't make it so, unfortunately. Nor for that matter does it make the argument a convincing one to those who aren't like-minded. 

That we *think* we perceived the zombies react in an unusual manner to the wind chime doesn't mean that we should jump to the conclusion that, above all else, this means that 'there may still be people left inside'. Why not instead consider, amongst any other number of possibilities, that sounds of a certain pitch may simply elicit this reaction in them, a result of a damaged (to varying degrees) and altered physiology? At least that's a conclusion based upon something we clearly know: that their bodies don't work as they did whilst alive, and so it's feasible that they may operate in ways we're currently unaware of. Equally it seems fairly plausible that Clem may have just got caught up in the moment: due to an expectation of the extraordinary being created for her by James' convincing words beforehand combined with the mesmerising, ritualistic-like nature of the moment itself.

You can't just flip a switch, but you DO need to engage in good self-care to prevent burnout. Mostly this has to do with just having healthy boundaries with people in general.

“East Asian students [tend] to be conformist, because of selection for conformity in ancient Chinese society”

the qin dynasty, the first emperor, was noted for having very sever punishment for what we would consider petty crimes.  he would kill not just the criminal, but also the entire family.  as a result, people who carried ""non-conformist"" genes were terminated and east asians today are more quiet and introverted and less criminal.  this is just the theory i have no idea if this is what watson was referring.  you could also bring up the impact of confucianism but i think the qin dynasty had a much more profound and permanent impact on the direction of east asian personalities.

"ee2xejk","Wow thank you for sharing this perspective, I totally understand what you’re saying and empathize with it. You seem to be very compassionate but also passionate for what you believe is true, and I really respect that. I think certain people in the trans community are occupying 90% of the airspace, they’re loud and ruthless. I understand it, because to achieve some sort of change you can’t be complacent, and can’t back down. But at the same time they’re pushing people away that would otherwise be supportive because they are so confrontational. I think it’s also a reflection of the social and political climate in the US right now, everyone is polarized and ready to blow, not many people want to sit down and have a conversation. Everyone that disagrees if ever so slightly, is your enemy, especially to a community that has been so actively hated on and discriminated against. But some people have questions, slight disagreements and other views, it doesn’t necessarily mean they’re the enemy, and labeling them as such burns down bridges. I think most trans people like me, that aren’t as polarized with their views, tend to be forgotten, possibly because I’m not loud and ruthless, I don’t want to be in the frontlines of a social battlefield, I just want to live my life, so I don’t engage and my views on these issues are pushed aside. Only the more extreme views get the spotlight. I honestly believe some of the trans activists have made things worse in some ways, now I’m lumped in with a social movement that I don’t really identify with, the no gender, queer, everyone is trans movement. I have a legitimate medical condition, I’m not a political pawn and I’m tired of being treated like one.

Politically I actually lean more towards the left, but I love watching Blaire White’s videos even though I disagree with her on many things, I love how real she is about things and it’s very interesting to hear her perspective. I looked up Kalvin Garrah and he seems to have a similar vibe, I gotta check him out more. I also love and recommend contrapoints, she’s really creative with her content and how she discusses things. 

About the penis in a locker room thing. I’ve been through that. I grew up with that thing between my legs and I never would even imagine showing it to anyone, especially not in a women’s locker room. Luckily my school had stalls for girls that didn’t want to undress/shower in front of everyone, which were actually the majority of them. I honestly don’t even get why locker rooms are so open. Anyways, I can’t understand how any trans woman would want to keep it and much less even show it in a locker room. I respect their decision and understand that some trans women actually like it, which blows my mind but not everyone experiences dysphoria in the same way so I get it. But to show it in a locker room makes no sense to me. Some women have been raped and it may be triggering, others haven’t but just don’t want to see a penis, there may also be young girls in there and they shouldn’t have to see a penis. I think it’s a little fucked up to say, “just deal with it”. This is the kind of stuff that pushes people away. Most women I know don’t care if a preop trans woman is in there, but I’m sure they don’t want to see their penis, I mean they don’t want to see vaginas either, so just be discrete. Don’t walk around like it’s a pride thing. Gosh. It’s a touchy subject. Everyone has a slightly different view on it. Some people think preop trans women can be in there but be discreet, others believe they shouldn’t be in there, others believe I shouldn’t even be in there, others believe I shouldn’t even go to the bathroom, others are totally fine with everything! How to make everyone content and feel safe is a question I can’t answer.

The idea that they can really get it can help, and it only makes sense not having that would put a person on edge. For me that she seems empathetic and kind is enough. I like the stability of knowing she doesn't really know. I don't know why precisely. But it is like I don't feel like she needs the experience of extreme CSA stuff or whatever to feel empathy. She pretty clearly feels compassion regardless. Once very early in therapy I told her that I felt vaguely suicidal, but it wasn't a big deal. For me it is not, it is life as it always had been. She did not get emotional then at all, handled it with concern, but not blowing it out of proportion. What she did was ask me what thoughts about it I had exactly. I told her the truth. The idea that I did not intend to act on, but that was going through my head, was specific. 

Her office is down a long hallway, on the opposite side of this hallway is a room with a door that is always open, and that room has a huge window that overlooks the picturesque square of the large town/very small city I live in, on the second floor. I told her I visualized myself getting a good running start down that hall and throwing myself through it. And she handled it. She was compassionate, but she just accepted that feeling as valid, that I was valid, and believed me when I said I would never actually do something so traumatizing for others. 

When I told her this we had been in trauma therapy all of 2 months, maybe. I had entered it because of my first and only actual suicide attempt 7 months earlier at that point. That is what I like most about her. She is like a Freudian in a way. Not in the blank screen, she is kind and compassionate, and not in the sense she will not talk about herself, she does relational therapy. But in the idea that she is stronger and ""better"" than me. That her way of being is something I can aspire to. I cannot explain it properly. It is like we are both equals who are able to get along well and have a real adult rapport. But it is also like she is an expert I can look up to. 

I like that, and feel like her good and decent background helps it. I like the idea of good, happy, decent homes. I have little experience of them, but when I think of such a home for a child it makes me happy. It just makes something soft inside me happy to know she had that proper love and kindness and teaching and actual discipline, instead of the love that is diseased no matter how real, kindness only with strings, and a combination of brutal punishment and allowing any sort of behavior depending on the adults mood, instead of actual discipline.

"edvfks0","&gt; So in reality, I agree with the premise of the OP, but with a different outcome. I don't think vegans should stop promoting their moral framework, as he suggests. I think they should continue to work to expand their moral framework to the rest of their life - including cellphones and clothes.

It's not a particularly productive response to just say 'people who are unreasonable and aggressive should just be reasonable and compassionate' but in essence yes. They shouldn't abandon their outlook of their moral framework entirely but it would be productive from several angles to step back and realise that no one is perfect and that imperfection is entirely ok, thus it's not morally egregious to not strictly follow their views of dietary pattern. 

There's a very real and legitimate argument to be made that being strict on yourself prevents the slippery slide effect and if you allow a little bit of cheating here and there you'll eventually just abandon it all together for comforts - we see this all the time with dieting and fitness, but I think there's a healthy medium between being strict towards your adherence to a standard and it's margin of 'laziness' and imposing on yourself (or others) a  standard of perfection, or near perfection... But then again, for a large number of vegans we're talking *ethics* here so for even the number of vegans who can suspend their views in the interest of discussion, I do understand that suggesting 'be less strict about condemning that thing you find to be morally reprehensible' is at least mildly offensive. But we all partake in this *vegan debate* and I feel to an extent we all need to suspend our feelings and personal offence for productivity. Not a reflection on you or I, more a tangent about the wider issue between discussing what may be edgy to towards some and it's impact on the subject in debate. 

But yeah, in OP's case and in mine, sometimes the criticism is meant as a return attack to an attack on us - *don't throw stones in a glass house* or *you're not perfect either* but in most cases it's meant to be a compassionate redirection of focus that we're all imperfect and we can all improve in various ways. 

Rather than being focused indefinitely on one topic and constricted by a straightjacket of perfection, it would be very helpful for most of us to take a more wholistic approach to the world and realise that we can *trim the fat off* several instances of harm and not punish ourself with the tunnel vision expectation of perfection in one instance.

For instance, I drink milk. I don't eat a lot of meat, almost never eat eggs and despite working in fisheries processing I rarely eat fish. I was vegan and occasionally I think about the fact that I drink milk with my coffee addiction and question if I can cut down. Realistically, I drink a litre a fortnight in coffee as I don't eat porridge or cereal. I only consume milk in coffee, but I also drink a lot of coffee. Coffee being the ponder drug, it leads me to think about my milk consumption and wether I can cut down. I've tried numerous times to go black and even though it's entirely not impossible, I find it disgusting so I always revert.

I've also tried *plant milks* but at prices 2-3 times that of regular milk and unpalatable tastes, I find again that although entirely possible I feel the discomfort of those solutions is not worth the incredibly minor benefit gained from not consuming dairy, in an ethical and environmental perspective.

Did you know a dairy cow produces about 10,000L of milk per year in Australia? That's 30L per day average production. At 1L per fortnight more or less, about 25L per year (52 weeks in a year X 0.5) a dairy cow in Australia satiates my yearly milk consumption with a day's labour. 

Now, I've seen a lot of anti-propaganda so I know the dairy industry is far less sinister than *some* vegan sources claim, you would think that my yearly impact as *one day of suffering* would more or less be the excuse I needed to condescendingly dismiss all vegan criticism or attack and live comfortably knowing I don't give a fuck... Yet knowing my impact is relatively small and not too far from veganism (in terms of dairy anyway) gives me the comfort to ponder long term solutions (over coffee of all things.) Rather than being shocked into elimination and reverting to high consumption again a few months later in a rinse and repeat fashion similar to fad diets and NYE fitness resolutions, I simply pace along at a long consumption. You think I would have all the excuse to say ""my impact is already small, I've reduced what I can, fuck everyone, I'm happy sitting at this point."" Yet, out of no fear of urgency or perpetuating the Holocoust, I keep revisiting this topic in my head pondering if I can cut down, drink less coffee, cut my coffee addiction, keep searching for more palatable and affordable dairy alternatives or if I can replace my stimulant addiction with something else like energy drinks, then I can trim my habits further. 

Rather than trying to be a nuclear bomb on one area eliminating all consumption, I try to simply trim the unnecessary fat in several areas and find ways to keep it off. If I can trim my consumption of milk by 1L of milk per year and convince 100 million people to do the same, that's the yearly production of 10,000 cows spared. 

Everything in society is a law of multiplicity. If I can convince one person either by way of compassion or bullying, to cut their consumption of an animal product entirely, then there's an almost unnoticeable impact. If I can convince someone who drinks 3L of milk per week to cut out all dairy milk, I've *'saved the world'* by 150L per year.... *IF* they keep it off. If I can convince several hundred, or several thousand people to merely trim off the fat of a few L of milk per year and keep it off, I'm already in the thousands of litres. 

The solution to all the worlds problems isn't elimination. Many of us non-vegans are on point with the argument that humans will have an impact no matter what but we never elaborate on that point. If we convince many people to simply trim the fat in several areas we'll have a much greater overall impact than trying to eliminate consumption entirely and reaching a very narrow audience. 

&gt; So my biggest issue with this post after-all is the unstated implication that all vegans act in such a way as he has described and that somehow is a critique of the vegan philosophy. 

Yes exactly, because even though I disagreed with your interpretation of his views in a couple of ways, you hit the nail on the head with feeling off for his comment. I think that just as it's important for vegans to not lash out and imply ""all non-vegans..."" in discussion *our side* also has to be strict on our criticisms to make sure we're not inadvertently implying *everyone* so your reply was fair and correct.

&gt; I would help encourage vegans to do better where possible.

And at the end of the day, this is the only point that really matters. If it's about the animals and the environment, the animals and the planet couldn't give a shit less about us all circlejerking about ethics on Reddit, what really matters is our actions. Compassionate and more relatable vegans are far more likely to expand and morph the views of non-vegans to encourage tangible change or the spread of positive ideas as are empathetic and realistic non-vegan criticisms of moral rigidity and *activism bias* productive to the greater outcome rather than mere toxicity.",1547273863,"it's not a particularly productive response to just say 'people who are unreasonable and aggressive should just be reasonable and compassionate' but in essence yes.","reasonable and compassionate","compassionate",NA,FALSE,"reasonable and compassionate","reasonable",NA,NA,0

"edu5oks","OK a serious explanation. In countries that are not US or Western Europe, people express their emotions more vigorously, with hollers and gestures. Like, you know the stereotype of a gesturing Italian, or dramatic South American? Something like that, but even more so in more traditional societies. It's a social thing, they do it in private but doubly so in public. A crowd is loud and noisy, when it processes the communal experience, expressing its sentiment. They kind of wear their mood on the outside, instead of inside, like in the West.

Simply put, when something bad happens, people (esp. women) will holler loudly, shake their heads, and wave their arms around. People will also not be ashamed of their status as onlookers, and laugh and point and yell loudly when excited, or make mournful and compassionate (but loud) yells and gestures if it goes bad for someone.

Think about it — people all over the world gawk at disasters, because it's break from everyday life and a formidable sight. For Westerners, this gawking should be externally explained as concern and compassion, and also be nearly silent, as if out of respect. People in more traditional societies do not have this obligation, and gawk freely, loudly expressing their thoughts and feelings.

Erasing a whole load of character traits from the current Doctor has had the effect of rendering her a shell of what went before.

Not every enemy needs compassion or kindness sometimes they just need to be eradicated. The ‘its personal‘ line wasn't even remotely believeable coming from her gurning cherub face. And that's a big problem when an actor has no gravitas screen presenc or charisma.

First in the Elephant Graveyard, then minutes after losing his father. He remembered Scar, a murderer, but still his uncle, begging for mercy as hyenas tore him apart.  

This was a really powerful way to bring in the trauma Simba experienced with the hyenas as a cub and how that colours his judgement towards them. It brings back a lot of the pain we see in the movie while adding some potent gravitas that can't be communicated through visuals alone.

"ed4f624","**The Lion Guard | *Clanless* | T | [AO3](https://archiveofourown.org/works/14568909/chapters/33665007)**

Warning: Graphic violence (Not in this excerpt)

**Context:** *Kion is trying to convince Simba to let a hyena he’s made friends with stay in the Pridelands after she was seriously injured and driven out of her territory by a rival group of hyenas. Kion has never previously told his parents about her, and when he was explaining the situation he didn’t tell them his friend’s species at first.*

“Actually, she’s a hyena.”  

Kion knew this probably wouldn’t go over well, but he couldn’t have predicted how Simba would react. What Kion knew of hyenas were a few stories, and his skirmishes with Janja, who while he sometimes got away with his poaching was more of an annoyance than anything else. But when Simba heard the word, he remembered being a helpless cub, younger than Kion, at the mercy of three fully-grown hyenas. First in the Elephant Graveyard, then minutes after losing his father. He remembered Scar, a murderer, but still his uncle, begging for mercy as hyenas tore him apart. Simba fixed Kion with a gaze like ice. “A hyena? You brought a hyena into the Pridelands?” 

“What? No! – well, yes! But Jasiri’s not like that, she’s my friend! She helped me fight Janja, and she’s never crossed the border until now, when she had to!” 

Simba remained unmoved. “Kion, it doesn’t matter how friendly you think she is. Hyenas can’t be trusted, and it’s against the law for them to enter the Pridelands. I want her out by tomorrow morning.” 

Kion couldn’t believe what he was hearing. “What? But I told you, she’s hurt! She can’t even walk, let alone find food on her own! If we don’t help her, she’ll die!” 
“That’s not our problem; not mine, not yours, not the Lion Guard’s. What Outlanders do to each other is none of our business. And honestly, having one less hyena to worry about doesn’t sound like such a bad thing.”  

Kion’s mouth hung open. “Are you joking? You – you can’t be serious!” He looked pleadingly at Nala. She had to back him up here!” 

“Kion, your father is right,” Nala said. Her voice was level and compassionate, but stern. “Remember, death is part of the Circle of Life. You can’t just interfere with every animal that’s injured, especially not outside our borders. And don’t try to tell Simba or I what hyenas are like. You weren’t around when Scar took over. You don’t know what it’s like to be ordered to hunt day and night because the hyenas said we owed them the food from when they were forced out of the Pridelands. You don’t know what it’s like to find your mother in a river with her neck broken and chunks bitten out of her, and have Scar lie and say it must have been crocodiles and forbid anyone to speak of it. You don’t know what it’s like to see male lion cubs just like you fed to the hyenas because everyone’s starving and they can’t serve the Pride as hunters. You think because one hyena pretended to be nice to you once that she’s your friend? You’re smarter than that.” 

Kion took a deep breath, trying to hold the worst of his words back, but his body betrayed his emotions. His ears and whiskers were back, his tail lashed from side to side, and his legs shook with fury. “So what, you want me to send an animal to her death when she’s done nothing to hurt anyone in the Pridelands, because some other hyenas hurt you before I was born? You want me to kill her?” 

“No, I didn’t say that,” Simba protested. Kion had hit a sore spot. Simba had never been comfortable with killing other animals, except for food. “I never said –“ 

Before the words left his mouth, Kion knew he would regret what he was about to say, but he was too angry to stop himself. His claws were dug in, and now he raked them across the wound. “Or maybe, if you really think she deserves to die that badly just for crossing the stupid border, you should kill her yourself. You know… like Scar?” 

Simba’s reaction was immediate. He rose to his feet, towering over Kion with a glare that would have made Bunga cower in terror. “You’re comparing me to Scar?” he said, his voice measured but raised. “You’re hanging out with hyenas, you invited one into the Pridelands, and now you’re disobeying an order from your king. Right now, you sound a lot more like Scar than me.” He turned on his heel and stormed back into the den, tail lashing. 

Kion sat there in stunned silence. There was nothing he could possibly say after that. Scar? He was like Scar for sticking up for his friend? 

“Kion…” Nala began. “What both of you said –“

“I don't want to hear it!” Kion interrupted his mother, jumping to his feet, pushing past her, and making his way down Pride Rock. Still seething, he started walking in a random direction, not really caring where he was going. “Like Scar…” he muttered. “I’m nothing like Scar, and I never will be!” 

**Note:** In *The Lion Guard,* Scar was the previous bearer of a power called the Roar of the Elders, and the previous leader of the Lion Guard. And Kion, like Scar, is the non-heir sibling of the heir to the throne, so going down the same path as Scar has been a source of anxiety for him for a while.",1546482268,"her voice was level and compassionate, but stern.","level and compassionate","compassionate",NA,FALSE,"compassionate , but stern","stern",NA,NA,1

"ectxjhb","The bane of my childhood existence was the strict rule my parents enforced on me for the duration of my childhood: absolutely no creativity was allowed under any circumstances. Looking back, I can understand their reasoning, though that does not necessarily mean I agree with it. My mother, an Analyst, had spent her childhood studying mathematics, and thus could do most calculations in her head in a matter of milliseconds with the utmost ease, since the moment she turned twenty-five years of age. My father was a Chemist. He spent his childhood studying the molecules that build our universe, and thus his power was to manipulate materials on a molecular level without strain. These abilities paved the road to a life of luxury, allowing them to claim a respectable career associated with their enhanced abilities. They simply wanted the same for me.

So, creativity was completely disallowed. ""Don't waste your time with anything artsy,"" they would say. ""The Painters are all deadbeats, the Musicians end up jobless, the Dancers can barely afford to get by, and the Authors never find success. Try reading this instead."" They would place in front of me a book on medicinal science or law. 

As any child can confirm, anything forbidden suddenly becomes the most attractive thing that a young mind can concieve of. So naturally, the arts captivated my curiosity. I was particularly interested in singing. I discovered, from my time singing in the shower or when I found myself alone, that I had a rather rich tenor voice. As often as I could, I would sing to myself, but when around my parents I would delve myself into the realm of biology. I felt guilty, looking at their proud faces, knowing the secret I held from them.

Soon, my twenty-fifth birthday drew ever nearer. The secret grew larger and larger, building up inside of me. The longer I kept it from them, the worse it would be. Still, I was afraid. Of what, I know not, but I was terrified of telling them. My parents were kind and compassionate, but the worst thing I could do, in my mind, was to let them down. So I kept my secret, walled up inside of me until it was far too late to change my fate.

Tommorow, it would be my twenty-fifth birthday.

Tommorow, I would become a Singer.

It was time to tell them about my secret hobby, to overcome my fear, before it would be too late. I sighed, then approached my parents timidly. My mother was sitting at the table, scribbling on her notepad lines of equations. My father, across from her, was studying something under a microscope. I coughed, getting their attention.

""Hey, son,"" my father greeted, looking up from his microscope. ""What're you doing still up? It's a big day tomorrow.""

""Your father's right,"" my mother remarked, not looking up from her notes, ""you need your rest, especially tonight.""

""Mom, dad, I have something I need to tell you."" I fiddled with my fingers nervously.

""Well, what is it?"" my mother asked, putting down her pencil and looking up from her task. I suppose she detected the seriousness in my tone.

""I, err..."" I took a deep breath before continuing. ""I don't think I'm going to be a Biologist.""

""Well, what else would you be?"" he asked, a puzzled expression plastered on his face.

""I've been, uhh, doing something in secret,"" I continued. ""I don't expect you to approve of this, and I understand completely if you don't, but..."" *Calm down*, I told myself. I had to take another deep breath to stop myself from trembling. ""I'm pretty sure that tomorrow, I'm going to become a Singer.""

Silence. I looked from my mother to my father, but they remained wordless. I couldn't quite read their expressions.

Abruptly, my mother jumped up and marched toward me. I flinched in preparation for the worst, but was surprised when she simply wrapped her arms around me in a hug. A moment later, my father stood up and joined in.

""You're not mad?"" I asked in shock.

""Of course not, honey,"" my mother said, her voice muffled from burying her face in my shirt. She looked up at me, and I saw her eyes water. ""No matter what you do, we'll be proud of you. You know we just wanted the best for you, right?""

""I know,"" I responded, and smiled.

And so I stood there, not a disappointment, but a source of pride. Surrounded by my family, I was ready to face whatever life might throw at me, starting tomorrow, the day of my twenty-fifth birthday.

In the beginning they did things right -- I always knew I was adopted.  I had a little book about it that I remember reading with my parents when I was three.  I was told that my birth mother cared about me and wanted me to have the best possible childhood, and she knew she wasn't ready to be a good parent so she gave me to a family that would be good parents for me.

"ecffhat","That's not entirely accurate.  Both the OT and NT come largely from a place of love - God is considered predominantly a compassionate but strong god, that protects His people, but does so because of a love.  However, he's also considered a God that is holy, and therefore requires His people to be holy as well.  In the OT, we can see God's love in the way he rescues his people, and claims them, and we can see His holiness in the laws.  This tension is also drawn out in a lot of the Psalms, and expounded more explicitly in some of the different prophets.  In the NT, Jesus certainly talks about love, and almost all NT writers make a point of emphasising the love of a father sacrificing his son to save us all, but there's still an element of holiness.  In discussions on divorce, Jesus says that Moses only permitted it because people are unable to be holy, and that the correct way to live is to never divorce.  Likewise, when telling his followers to go out into the surrounding towns to tell people about him, he says ""If anyone will not welcome you or listen to your words, leave that home or town and shake the dust off your feet. Truly I tell you, it will be more bearable for Sodom and Gomorrah on the day of judgment than for that town.""

While this still comes from love, it needs to be recognised that Jesus is explicitly saying here that the places that reject him will suffer something even worse than the absolute destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah.  God hasn't changed from the OT to the NT, but rather, the message he is sending to the world has changed.

That said, the theology of the people of The Handmaid's Tale is not something that can be derived from either the OT or NT.  For example, there is a philosophy that shuns pleasure in sex, but the OT revels in the enjoyment of love, relationships, and sex - it includes an entire chapter dedicated to King Solomon and a nameless woman falling in love, and enjoying the physical aspects of their relationship as much as the emotional aspects.

The oppression of certain castes of society is also difficult to reconcile with the OT.  While the Bible does condone slavery, it is generally treated as a system where people can work off a debt paid to another person, although there are exceptions.  Even in this situation, however, there are plenty of rules about how to deal with slaves, including letting them go free after a maximum amount of time.  Outside of slavery, the OT prophets go to great pains to explain to people that one of the most important things to God is the love of each other.  Hosea tells the people that God desires ""mercy, not sacrifice, // and acknowledgment of God rather than burnt offerings"".

In fact, it's worth recognising that the Israelite society had a fairly early wealth redistribution system - tithing was mandated, and the money raised went to the religious establishment to pay for the priests, but also to care for the widows and the orphans - those who would not have anyone else with a responsibility to help them.

The idea of anyone in this society living in fear is also completely antithetical to the NT, and discouraged even in the OT.  While there is a concept of ""fearing the Lord"", it is always tempered with knowing God as a father, protector, shepherd, saviour, etc.  God is powerful, and awesome in the literal sense of filling one with awe, but he is also present.  Here the OT and the NT are probably most different, because the NT is predicated on Jesus as a way to reach God, whereas the OT used priests, prophets, and other intermediaries to intercede between both parties.

That said, a consistent refrain from God throughout both the OT and NT is ""do not be afraid"".  Almost every time an angel appears to people in the Bible, they tell them not to be afraid, and we see in the Psalms that the writers consider God to be one who specifically watches out for the meek, the humble, and the ""little people"" of society.  God is a god who hates injustice, so any society that creates and encourages injustice (as the one in the Handmaid's Tale does) is entirely antithetical to Christian - or even Jewish - life.

I've predominantly used OT references here because I think people see the OT as something that needed to be corrected in some way by the NT, and I don't think that's correct.  The predominant message of love can be found all the way through the Bible, right back to the beginning.

The society of The Handmaid's Tale is a deliberate corruption of the Bible, both OT and NT, based on certain cultural corruptions of the Bible that we see in the present day.  Particularly, it reflects the right-wing evangelical movement in America, which claims a Biblical basis, but often exhibits values that are extremely lacking.  (This isn't to say that all evangelicals aren't Christian, or that evangelical theology is wrong per se, but rather that the current society of many evangelicals in the US is horrifically un-Christian.)  It's a book that describes how people can use and abuse a text to inflict their own fantasies on people, and use it as an excuse and a reason when they wish to cause harm and distress to others.",1545613478,"both the ot and nt come largely from a place of love - god is considered predominantly a compassionate but strong god, that protects his people, but does so because of a love.","compassionate but strong","compassionate","but",FALSE,"compassionate but strong","strong",NA,NA,1

"ec7rgf0","This episode seriously featured a lot of cool character advancement.

It's really cool to see how Goblin Slayer is changing over the course of the show. He's come a long way with both The Priestess and the rest of the group, becoming not only more compassionate, but thoughtful and friendly. It's become more apparent this episode just how much he has changed, with the group seemingly tethering him back to humanity; regaining some of his human side whilst still maintaining his hatred and blood-lust against Goblins. Hell, we even got to hear him *laugh* this episode with The Priestess.

Also cool to see that they don't intend to hide Goblin Slayer behind his armor the entire time. It's almost like seeing a whole new side of him, one that he obviously wishes not to show everyone.

Sword-maiden isn't all she's cracked up to be, she's human, after all. She lives with the same fear and anxiety as everyone else, especially after being abused by the Goblins. Not only that, but Goblin Slayer too opens up to The Priestess later about his own insecurities and fears. 

Great to see that Goblin Slayer isn't incompetent against non-Goblin foes. While he doesn't directly know how to fight or counter them, he seems capable of using tactics that he would use against Goblins, and altering them on the fly for new situations, or even coming up with new theories and ideas on how to fight. He came up with the plan for that fight pretty quick, using what limited knowledge he had along with some new ideas to test out ahead of time.

Just wanna give a quick shot out to the Behold the Beholder joke, even if it's not referenced by name.

If Goblin Slayer doesn't end up in a bed with Guild Girl by the end, I'm gonna be pretty upset.

"ec3s9d3","I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE GOING THROUGH. Hold onto this scripture: Christ is made strong through your weakness. 

You need to go buy Abba's Child by Brennan Manning immediately. Period.

In this long winded answer I hope to show you compassion, that I have been there, I am still there in many ways, and I hope to give you real life scriptural based examples you can use today. Right now. Roman's 8 is great place to live for people like us. Read it whenever you're in the pit.

I know depression, loneliness, anxiety, and that your belief in God is very real and the conflict this causes and wondering if God has abandoned you or why you can't find peace.

I have dealt with this for years and I get sick of people just saying ""it's not about feelings."" The fruits of the spirit are peace love joy patience kindness self control. So where is it?! Where is God in all this? 

I can only relate my experience and that when I go through this I have to cry my heart out to God, read scripture, pray and move forward. I learned the hard way that I have to submit my views and feelings to scripture. This is what people are trying to kinda say when they say ""it's not about feelings"" but that response lacks compassion and empathy. Empathy and compassion are trademarks of Jesus ministry-boldly ask Jesus to minister to your spirit. On this note of feelings and scripture and your thoughts Tim Keller explains how in the Psalms the writer commands his own soul to worship God. Use this example and command your own soul to be thankful and look at God, and not at your problems.

(One note here-I discovered before some of this that exercise and meditation can help in a huge way with depression. My christian therapist recommended one to three hours a day of exercise during my darkest times.)

When faced with loneliness, depression, and feeling abandoned by God the absolute first place to turn is scripture and prayer. I find praise music helps me a lot too. 

Good news right now! Shane and Shane and John Piper directly address your issues through scripture and praise, and it's a compassionate but mature and difficult answer, but it is also real power and grace. Link: 
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=qyUPz6_TciY

Other Christian's have been through this for centuries so we turn to their stories. Psalms is the best place to start. Tim Keller has a sermon on Psalm 3 about anxiety and fear  specifically that helped me tremendously. The Psalms are packed with uncertainty, feelings of abandonment, dread, and wondering aloud where God is. Once even asking if God Himself is asleep. 

HERE IS A LARGE PART OF THE ANSWER TO WHY: God uses broken people. Let God use your brokenness. 

All through the OT and NT God uses the most messed up people. Brennan Manning addresses this with empathy and real life examples as well as scripture and parables in his book Abbas Child. That is a fantastic place to start. Spurgeon reminds us that if God only saved good people there would be nothing miraculous about this. I am telling you that God wants your brokenness, your depression, and your loneliness so that you can show another broken person you understand what they are going through. So you can show them Christ in you.

This year God moved in my life in a miraculous way and immediately He put into my hands A Long Obedience in the Same Direction by Eugene Peterson. It is basically a roadmap to the long term Christian life and it boils down to scripture/obedience/prayer. Peterson is very compassionate and soft spoken but he leaves no doubt the Christian life will be tough. This is where the prophets are such real examples. Some ran. Some were afraid. Some were angry.  

My mother reminded me today Elijah knew the real true raw and dangerous power of God Almighty and called fire from the sky to destroy the prophets of Baal. Butimmediately after this incredible act of Gods power he experienced and gave into fear and fled because of a measly earthly queen. She told me this because I was in the pit after an incredible summer of God moving in my life in a miraculous way. It helps me tremendously to know that prophets of God had doubts and fears.

God also dropped Spurgeon into my lap and his book All of Grace so changed my life that on any tough lonely night I fall asleep to the audiobook. That book is amazing. Spurgeon always reminds us to go boldly before God reminding Him of His covenant and promises.  Spurgeon always reminds us that we are Gods children, His Chosen, and to be bold, but like Paul I have found Spurgeon to be very tender and empathetic when I read his writings.

Next is fasting. Throw yourself at God. Beg Him for peace and grace submitting your needs to Him. A simple way to fast is that any discomfort or hunger is reminder to pray. Over and over and over. Petition. 

The next way is to ask God to give you someone to encourage. Yep. Drag your depressed butt down to a homeless ministry and force yourself to help others. Go to your local AIDS outreach and volunteer. Or find a prison ministry. 

The next is to wake up and start by thanking God for everything He has given you. A roof, job, and food. 

Let me assure you beyond a shadow of a doubt that you will not find peace without obedience to scripture. It's tough but true. I had to stop after a very rough 2 weeks and say ""OK God basically what I know of you is that you want remove sin from my life. So since I dont know where you are and I feel distant from you is there a sin in my life that needs to stop or a past sin that needs to be addressed?"" 

Next pray scripture back to God. Pray His promises back to Him. And pray spiritual warfare. Rebuke the enemy in the name of Jesus and send the enemy back to the pit and keep looking at Jesus. When its rough I simply think and pray about Jesus in Gethsemane. Where He faced real fear. I pray my requests to God knowing the power of the resurrection has all authority over my depression and loneliness.

I hope this helps. 

This is from Abba's Child by Brennan Manning. It is not directly from scripture but helped me tremendously. It shows why sometimes God doesnt seem to answer questions of depression, loneliness, or abandonment. 

excerpt from the Thorton Wilder play, “The Angel that Troubled the Waters”.The play is based on the biblical verses of John 5:1-4, but it changes the end of the parable. I first encountered this excerpt within the book “Abba’s Child: The Cry of the Heart for Intimate Belonging“, by Brennan Manning.
The play tells of a physician who comes periodically to the pool of Bethesda, hoping to be the first in the water and healed of his melancholy when the angel appears and troubles the water. Everybody at the pool also hopes to be the first in the water and thereby healed of his malady.
An angel appears and blocks the physician at the moment he is ready to step into the pool and be healed.
Angel: “Draw back, physician, this moment is not for you.”￼
Physician: “Angelic visitor, I pray thee, listen to my prayer.
Angel: “This healing is not for you.”
Physician: “Surely, surely, the angels are wise. Surely, O Prince, you are not deceived by my apparent wholeness. Your eyes can see the nets in which my wings are caught; the sin into which all my endeavors sink half-performed cannot be concealed from you.

Angel: “I know""
Physician: “Oh, in such an hour was I born, and doubly fearful to me is the flaw in my heart. Must I drag my shame, Prince and Singer, all my days more bowed than my neighbor?”
Angel: “Without your wound where would your power be? It is your very sadness that makes your low voice tremble into the hearts of men. The very angels themselves cannot persuade the wretched and blundering children on earth as can one human being broken on the wheels of living. In Love’s service only the wounded soldiers can serve. Draw back.”
Later, the person who enters the pool first and was healed rejoices in his good fortune then turns to the physician before leaving and said:
“But come with me first, an hour only, to my home. My son is lost in dark thoughts. I — I do not understand him, and only you have ever lifted his mood. Only an hour . . . my daughter, since her child has died, sits in the shadow. She will not listen to us but she will listen to you.”
￼
For me, this story has made an incredible difference and, because the message of this excerpt—“Without your wound where would your power be?“—carries so much meaning for me. As this has taught me that its through my weakness I can see others like Jesus does.

&gt; it still felt like 13 was “discovering” herself for far longer than any other Doctor 

It doesn't feel that way to me. I'm not sure why people bring this up so oten... Is it because she's hypocritical? The Doctor's often been hypocritical...

Her lines felt like Thirteen's to me, because she was the one to say them. I really liked her deliveries.

I don't understand why people keep complaining about her skill. She has the skill to act a boring, every day character with every day reactions (watch Broadchurch). The way her Doctor acts so different, new, and unusual are one of the reasons I love her in the role. (The awkward way she uses the sonic, for example, is an idiosyncrasy very unique to her Doctor. It feels like a ritualistic tic of some sort. I like how she's exagerated her emotions sometimes, and I enjoy the way she delivers what I see as the Doctor's ""fangirl"" lines.)

I have no problems with the perspective of the show.

I have no problems with 13's growth. I agree she hasn't evolved as much as Graham, but Graham is a human recovering from grief. Thirteen is an alien who's 20 times his age who's just got off extremely difficult years of her life, and now that she's finally been given room to breathe, she's definitely been enjoying it (going on fun adventures and all).

&gt;But again, I disagree - in Hartnell’s first season he went from

Hartnell's first season had 17+ hours, Whitaker's had less than 10 hours. The focus of the show was definitely more on Ian and Barbara about the first 10 hours. I don't see that change in attitude you highlighted ""growth"", though. It felt more like he was letting Ian and Barbara in. He does seem to become more open as it goes, but I don't see how One had more growth than Thirteen in that interval, they both seem relatively static compared to other incarnations of the Doctor, but they both do grow (I'd compare Whitaker a lot more to Two, anyways).

&gt;while S11 is lacking both in villains and a truly likeable set of companions (other than Graham) 

Eh... I really liked the series' antagonists, they were refreshingly creative. They're one of the reasons I enjoy this series so much. 

I loved the companions, and they're the most likeable to me than almost all nuwho companions. I love Graham and Ryan, and I really like Yasmin.

&gt; I think Ryan has promise but the acting is wonky

His acting isn't wonky, that's his character. Ryan has dyspraxia. Like Jodie Whitaker, Tosin Cole is perfectly capable of acting an average person with average body language - see Eastenders E20. I really think what he managed to pull off with Ryan was excellent work, and it must not have been easy, specially considering there are so little references he could have taken things from.

&gt; while Yaz might be the weakest companion in 55 years,

Definitely not. As much as people go on about Susan, I'd say she's weaker than Yaz, just to name one, really. Besides, Mandip Gill won some sort of people's award, which definitely means there are several people who like Yaz enough to vote on her. I relate to her life less than the others, but I understand what makes her compelling for others when they explain it to me.

&gt;just an excuse for inconsistent writing regarding her morals (which make no sense whatsoever).

They do make sense... and she's not even the first Doctor to have them. All of them have had this type of moral to some degree. She only talks about it more openly (I don't think the Doctor's ever admitted to being a hypocrite out loud the way she did that scene with Ryan). (Of course, I may be forgetting, there's the fact Eleven kept owning up to being a liar at least.)",1544703504,"i disagree with your opinion, so i don't see how it's a shame for them...  &gt;yeah, she’s kind and compassionate, but so is every other incarnation and those qualities,  she's more than them, though.","kind and compassionate","compassionate",NA,FALSE,"kind and compassionate","kind",NA,NA,0
"ebnxn99","Me: American with no religious affiliation, lived whole life in the Bible Belt. 

Wife: German with no religious affiliation, in US for all but her first 8 years but has a (deserved!) german-christmas-superiority complex. We're a same-sex couple.

Kids turned 5 in October. We basically celebrate a cultural Christmas (lights! bells! gifts!), with lots of discussion of parallels/differences to other religions' and cultures' winter observances (light/dark, cold/warm, alone/together, tradition/novelty, etc).

No, I am not fun at parties.

Weather permitting, we visit a local school's Weihnachtsfeier/markt at the beginning of December for Glühwein, Kekse, and used German books.

We get a small fir tree because I like the pagan roots and they're pretty.

""St Nikolaus"" fills shoes on the 5th/6th because everybody likes chocolate and free stuff. This year, I tried to use it as a talking point to remind us all to be generous and compassionate, but like I said, they're 5, so I think all they heard was ""chocolate for breakfast is good."" Which is a hard point to argue!

We don't ""do Santa"" because the whole faux-religious concept reeks of outdated Victorian morals. We've asked the kids to respect other people's beliefs because most choose to do Santa, but again, they're 5 and like knowing The Truth, so their classmates have probably heard it.

Instead, we exchange presents with each other on Christmas eve and have a relaxed, casual meal. Christmas day, we visit with the local extended family, eat lunch, swap gifts, etc.

My wife loves Christmas carols in any language, so there's sporadic listening/singing of those all season long.

Probably the most non-US thing she does is take 2 weeks off work, to coincide closely with the time the kids are out of school. She started it last year and is excited to do it again.

Because I'm southern, I usually cook a big traditional New Year's dinner (beans, greens, cornbread, cocktails, etc) and invite everybody, Open-House style.

"ebnlq19","**Hey guys. Holofan4life here. Welcome to the Toradora Christmas Club rewatch. I love Toradora so much. In fact, the 2016 Toradora Christmas Club rewatch is the reason why I created my account.**

**So, this year, I’m going to leave my thoughts just like last year. However, I’ll be watching the subbed version for the first time. Should really be a lot of fun. Toradora is my favorite anime of all time, and I hope everyone enjoys it.**

**By the way, I’ll also be keeping a tally of how many times Taiga hits Ryuuji. I’m doing it to prove that Taiga isn’t as violent as people say she is. It is currently at 24.**

1: Right off the bat, I just want to say that I love this episode. I love, love, love it. I know a lot of people who don't, but I disagree. In fact, it’s in my top 5 Toradora episodes. And the reason why is simple: Taiga motherfucking Aisaka.

When I first started watching Toradora, this was the episode that cemented Taiga Aisaka as my favorite tsundere of all time. I just think she is so adorable in this episode. From the way she blushes, to her insecurity, to the fact she actually apologizes to Ryuuji for being difficult to deal with, I just really love Taiga in this episode.

A lot of people know that Holo is my main best girl. Well, if Holo is my main girl, Taiga Aisaka is my second favorite girl. She is just so cute in this episode. It’s unbelievable. The whole episode I just want to pick her up and cuddle her and comfort her and put a smile on her face and make her happy.

This episode really does an amazing job of making Taiga likable. She isn’t someone who’s just pointlessly violent all the time. She is actually very delicate, and this episode showcases that. This episode does so much for Taiga as a character. The last episode did a lot for Ami as a character. Well, this episode is tenfold compared to that episode. We’ve been given scenes that showed that Taiga is insecure. I mean, look at the pole scene or the cookie scene from episode 2. This episode is almost completely scenes of Taiga showing her vulnerable side, and it’s glorious.

I could literally sit here and type and gush and gush and gush about why I love this episode so much. I truly think it’s the most underrated episode in the series. I think it is a remarkable 22 minutes of television. It is engaging, it is griping, it is compelling, it has wonderful animation, it has funny comedic moments, it has effective dramatic moments, it has a good musical score, and it furthers the story along. I love this episode so much.

Anyway, enough gushing. Let’s get to the actual episode.

2: We start off exactly where we left off last episode. I like that a lot. I just finished watching A Certain Magical Index II as I type this, and they do that a lot in the ToAru series. I’m a big fan.

3: I swear, Ami can be such a bitch at times. I love it.

4: Ryuuji’s mom sounds so concern about Taiga in the beginning of this episode. You can really tell she cares a lot about her.

5: Ryuuji sleeps with no shirt on and just in shorts. Either he must feel really hot and he’s trying to cool down or really cold. Given this takes place during summer, I assume he must feel hot as for why he’s shirtless.

6: Taiga doesn’t even get mad when Ryuuji hits her with a broom. This shows how far she’s come. If Ryuuji hit Taiga with a broom in an earlier episode, she would’ve definitely responded.

7: Taiga hitting Ryuuji: 26

As Taiga and Ryuuji are running, Taiga hits Ryuuji twice, one offsceen and one onscreen. I swear, this is how Taiga’s character should be. Vulnerable, but violent. She should be 80% vulnerable and 20% violent. Not too violent to where you would hate her, but also just the right amount of violence to where you would put up with it. I love Taiga so much.

8: This is my first time watching sub, and seeing Taiga call Ami ""Baka chi"" is so glorious. It is amazing.

9: Seeing Minori lift Taiga up like she weighs nothing makes me think having sex with Taiga must be fun (I’m sorry, please don’t hate me, I’m only joking. Taiga is for love and hugs, not lewds).

10: I love seeing Taiga politely asking Minori to not use her as a weight. It’s so cute.

11: This episode is the first episode where we see what Ms. Yuri, the teacher, is like. She obviously is caring and compassionate, but she also is so desperate to not be single it’s driving her crazy. Personally, I prefer a good Christmas cake.

Of all the side characters, Ms. Yuri is my favorite secondary character. She has the perfect blend of seriousness and comedic charm. She kinda embodies the style of show: funny, but serious when she needs to be. We saw her be serious in episode 1, and now we’re seeing her comedic side.

12: I really do feel sorry for Taiga. Sometimes, when I’m sleeping with my stuffed animal (Yes, I’m 21 and still sleep with a stuffed animal. I’m not ashamed to admit it.), I imagine the scenes from this episode where Taiga is being vulnerable and pretend I’m hugging her. I think I may have mental problems. I also feel this comment may come to haunt me and I’ve creeped tons of potential readers. Sorry.

13: Ami looks really good in her swimsuit. In fact, she pulls it off the best. I like this touch as it’s to be expected since she is a model, after all.

14: The reason why Minori doesn’t want to get matching swimsuits with Ami isn’t because she hates Ami, but because she realizes doing so will make her be overshadowed by Ami since Ami looks so amazing in hers.

15: Ryuuji is lucky the glass didn’t break when he went face first in the mirror. Can you imagine Ryuuji needing to get stitches? That would be horrible.

16: Rie Kugimiya does such a phenomenal job in this episode. It is incredible. I just really love her performance as Taiga. She is able to bring out that vulnerable side to such an outstanding level.

17: I also really love how Ryuuji talks to Taiga in this episode. He isn’t dense or uncaring. He’s supportive and is trying to make Taiga feel happy. Ryuuji is such a good person.

18: I do wish Ryuuji hugged Taiga at least once this episode and told her point blank ""You’re not ugly. I promise. You are perfect just the way you are"". He might get punched as a result, but Taiga is in some serious need of comforting.

19: On MyAnimeList, this list Ryuuji’s mom as having F-cup-sized breasts. Lord have mercy.

20: There’s a funny difference between the manga version and the anime version of the scene where Taiga is poking Ryuuji’s mom’s breasts. In the anime version, they don’t make mention of it after it happens. However, in the manga, there’s an additional scene where later on it is shown that Ryuuji’s mom lifts her shirt and shows Taiga her naked boobs, with Ryuuji’s mom saying she’s doing it because she’s seemed interested. On the one hand, I’m glad the anime version doesn’t contain that scene because I don’t think Ryuuji’s mom is a slut and it’s ultimately just pointless fanservice. On the other hand, Ryuuji’s mom’s boobs is Love, Ryuuji’s mom’s boobs is Life.

21: Seeing Taiga cry breaks my heart every single time.

22: It’s amazing Taiga doesn’t hit Ryuuji for saying she has a flat chest. Also, flat is justice.

23: And on top of that, Taiga stays up all night when Ryuuji is making her pads. What a sweetheart.

24: I absolutely adore the scene where Taiga apolgoizes for being difficult to deal with. So many times you see violent tsuderes who don’t even try to offer up an apology. By having Taiga apologize, it makes her more likable.

25: I believe Taiga is playing a system closely resembling a Super NES.

26: Kitamura looks good without glasses.

27: Seeing Noto be jealous over Kitamura is really funny.

28: One thing I’ve never really noticed is that when Ryuuji is at the pool, he has bags undeneath his eyes. This makes sense, as he stayed up all night working on Taiga’s pads. Little touches like these are why I love Toradora so much.

29: Noto upon seeing Ami in swimsuit: I’m kinda moved… in more ways than one ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

30: The scene where Ami imagines saying ""Like my shadow"" is in my opinion funnier in the dub. In the sub, Ami says something along the lines of ""Lick my shadow. It must taste like gourmet food to you"". In the dub, she says something along the lines of ""Lick my shadow. Lick it! Lick it!"" The way Ami’s English voice actress delivers the line is in my opinion much funnier than the way Ami’s Japanese voice actress delivers the line, as Ami’s English voice actress delivers it at a frantic pace and with devilous intent.

31: I love Taiga’s bun hair. She looks so kawaii.

32: When Minori is in the pool, she has hair sticking up at the back of her neck. Again, another nice detail.

33: Ami may look more beautifuler , but Taiga in her swimsuit will always be better than Ami in her swimsuit.

34: I love Taiga’s blushes. They’re so cute.

35: Kitamura referred to Minori as chief. If Monori is chief, does that Taiga ""It""?

35: Ami seriously can be a dick at times. However, at least she shows concern when Taiga is drowning. That shows she can be compassionate.

36: Seeing Ryuuji essentially cop a feel will never not be funny.

37: I also was thoroughly amused at Taiga screaming ""Apologize!""

But to me, episode 7 of Toradora ranks right up there. I think it is a remarkable 22 minutes of television. It is engaging, it is griping, it is compelling, it has wonderful animation, it has funny comedic moments, it has effective dramatic moments, it has a good musical score, and it furthers the story along.

"ebidl6d","**BEST (gonna do two here):** 

FIRST: Not sure if this one ""counts"" but my best experience is with an ongoing FWB who lives on other side of the country. We've hooked up 5-6 times this year. But we've been hooking up on and off for a couple of years. He's my best experience because he's SO chill and not insecure before, during, and after (probably helps that we have an established rapport and have spent considerable amount of time together). The ongoing flirtation and seduction and sweetness without neuroses makes the sex and the lead up to it each time super fun. It also probably helps that we get to hook up in nice hotel rooms. The sex itself with him is fantastic because he is so patient and consistently makes me cum.

SECOND: Excluding the above, the best new/random/singular hook up was with a guy who I met on Tinder who had a delayed flight at my local airport. We connected and it was getting good and steamy, and he said he thought he had time to leave, come meet up, hopefully hook up, and then still make his flight. We met up, quickly went back to my place, had very good sex, and I told him it was a shame that we had to rush him out. He asked me if I really wanted to go at it again, and I said yes. He said it was worth missing his flight for. Somehow he was able to get it up again, and we had an awesome, much slower and sensual second act. Fell asleep. Fucked again middle of the night, and one more time in the morning. He wasn't able to get on a flight until later that afternoon, lol. Anyway, it was definitely the most memorable. The sex was good. It was fun/funny, and I just liked him a lot.

**WORST:**

Had pretty bland, not-great sex with a guy who was reasonably attractive in pics and when I met him, but he was just so awkward and nervous and strange that the attraction kept plummeting. It still seemed good enough to go for it, but, umm, I wasn't thrilled with his lack of manscaping and a bit of a not-great smell. By the time we were fucking, I wanted it over with, and thankfully he came suuuuper quickly. So, what made this bad experience the worst is that he got really quiet and weird afterward, and then I heard him crying in the bathroom. I tried to be kind and compassionate, but he didn't respond in detail, gave weird platitudes. He went on his way. He sent me a msg a few days later saying that he was in a relationship, and that he'd made a mistake, etc. I did the research and found out that he was married with kids. I told him to forgive himself, do what he needs to do (tell his wife, preferably, but if not, just move on), but to not contact me and to do better in the future with other people.

I have always been upfront on my interest of pursuing medical school, so he are aware of that. He is a physician and overall understanding and compassionate, but also older and a bit out of touch with how med school application/admissions process works now vs when he applied. Whenever we meet he always makes a point to ask how I am doing (genuinely) and sincerely thank me for the work I am doing. He can be hard to read sometimes though, and depending on his mood can perceive things the wrong way, or sometimes certain things can flip his mood. I’ve been with this research project since its infancy and am extremely proud of the work I have accomplished and would argue am just as invested in it as he is. I have a solid chance of being on 1-2 pubs over the next year as well so even if I finically could afford quitting (which I can’t) I wouldn’t want to outright quit.

"eb5w4ds","I just thought I would add just a little more to this debate. Tolle is mentioned a lot here and many people hang their spiritual  hat on him. There is no doubt he is a catalyst for some form of awakening for a lot of folks. He has given many people a vision of something else, or deeper than,  materialism and 'one way' mainstream religion. He has also taught a method(s) to deal with ordinary suffering which many find useful. I find him to be a compassionate but idiosyncratic character.

Just to be clear that's an initial awakening and it can be lost and does not necessarily lead to anything profound. You can get this at any age, as a transmission from a book media or the local parlor mystic.  Having received this makes you potentially a 'seeker'. As a seeker you are exploitable, naive and often still a 'dumbass'. You are a convert. No different to the jesus freak or the buddhist sutra basher. I say this because I have been all of these, so this is not a put down.

That's phase one, so to speak. What is beyond that requires you to really wake up. I don't think many will get beyond that by the Tolle route. You may need to broaden your study and life experience and circles to do that. Everyone points to their  initial  or most influential, catalyst  source 'that did it for me and can do it for you and the world' in a sort of evangelical way'.

If this is what Tolle is pointing to as thousand of awakened people, then yes he is correct. However they are not awake in any true sense. It's a potential beginning and if you are in the position a most thankful one (at least initially until you start to realise what you have got yourself into :). On some level you have just swapped one view for another, the real intelligence, insight and understanding has not appeared yet. The true awakening is an utterly radical shift. The difference is profound. Then you may not have any utopian views about the world or humanity or this planet or plane of existance or spiritual evolution.

Velen had wanted to abandon the city, to have it standing empty when the orcs descended. Wanted to save as many draenei lives

convinced him it would not work.

that... it must be true.""

My kids had never seen anyone punch or kick anyone ever, yet my boys defaulted to that at some point and i had to correct the behavior. The little girls would bully through exclusion of other little girls. The behavior was attempted to be corrected, but because they are girls they were also let off with less punishment than the boys. This is the beginning of the spoiling of girls, they learn that there isn't repercussions for their actions and throughout their life they tend to be shitty because of it. 

So simply, both genders are born a certain way, if behaviors are not corrected they shitty human being portion really shines through. Boys who's behavior is not corrected end up in jail. Girls.... well they're let off and even told their victims even though what they did was shitty. Simple example, Casey Anthony, had the daughter been in the fathers care and the child was killed, the father would have been locked up for life. But because Casey was a women, she was let off, simple as that. These examples happen all the time in life. This is also why men tend to dominate fields where mistakes can be fatal and women don't.

But because this guy is disabled I'm not sure if he would understand why I'm saying no, or why his behaviour is upsetting me. So many dudes seem to struggle with it anyway, so I feel like this man needs a gentler or differently worded approach.

&amp;#x200B;

If I were you I would gently but firmly raise my hand up and out ( shut him out of your personal space- seriously your female scent/perfume, hug may be addicting by default if he has a lack of that in his life, and being a ""fool"" type would lack natural boundaries and just go for what he can get. He has a crush on you and is seeking that female dopamine/serotonin ""hit"" CUT HIM OFF OF THAT SUPPLY ASAP. Someone mentally/developmentally challenged- you never know how it will escalate or how quickly this guy is developing an obsession.

So- He approaches for the In- You pull out hand like a STOP and you kindly , sweet in a ""I hate to say this, but I need a favor from you"" that You are IN LOVE with your boyfriend, and you know he would not like that kinda thing, bc you know it would make you uncomfortable too.   I find that having a BF, married, not interested really doesn't not dissuade most guys who have an eye for you and are into you- its almost a challenge, or hanging around for a chance for an ""in."" It is what it. Hope you find it flattering.

Tell him your flattered that he likes to be cute- but You are IN LOVE and you hope he understands ( smiling nicely with almost a cute abashed demeanor)    Something about being in LOVE with your MATE is respected, inspired and admires (gentle let down) and Signals NOT WORTH TROUBLE Pursuing, because THEY KNOW IN-LOVE Bonds are pretty impenetrable and there is nothing NOTHING they can do to get in between, or in the way of that. Just no Room- and assume Loyalty and boys/men tend to take that Fact less personally, helps their Ego go ""meh, just not my luck....""

Again, gushing GUSHHHHH about how wonderful and CRAZY in love you are until he no longer wants to hear. How can any one , even child like mind, not understand and Respect that being IN LOVE is something No one can HELP and pretty unshakable.

My GF was amazed by for this: How do you always Let Guys Down , and then they even like you more for it??? Again, I dont say I have a BF/Married....I make it CLear ,

1. IM Flattered     2. But, Im helplessly in LOVE with my man, you understand.... (their eyes just register it and they almost get HAPPY - WHY? HOPE......you reject for GOOD reasons and give them Hope and Inspiration to have that kind of true wholesome loyalty/love feeling EXISTS and can be possible for them someday with someone too. You cant hate/compete with Being IN LOVE. They instinctually know this, and are almost secretly happy that that kind of thing, lotalty to True Love exists.    I Usually get the ""hes lucky.."" or ""I wish you luck with that..""    But all wiggle room tends to CEASE ASAP.

Hope this helps and you try it. This way you can still be in same social place, and no hurt feelings really.  He may be distant for a spell, but then they will just accept , chill out and see you as a Person, rather than something to be chased or a conquest (because they dont want to lose out on ""the chance"" to bond, etc )

Explain to him like hes 5 - that you a hopelessly foolish in LOVE princess, and you although it was nice to be extra-friendly and hug BEFORE, you know he understand how you have to be respectful and loyal of your prince/king, because he is very true and respectful and loyal to you- so it would just not be fair and no longer feels right to be that close to anyone but him now.

&amp;#x200B;

First, desiring a sane border policy and enjoying the rights afforded to you by birth (or earned through legal immigration and naturalization) is not hypocrisy.

It was clear in my statement and from past replies in other threads that my issue was with colorism and people who think you should lose your job if you work someplace where their morals don't line up with the company's. Plus, there's also the fact that you'll have a harder time finding CF products even in America if you don't have ""desirable"" traits according to society, and it seems like for some reason [that's really hard for them to understand?](https://np.reddit.com/r/muacjdiscussion/comments/8wmbgg/can_we_please_talk_about_holierthanthou_cf_people/e1y6pxx/) Like how much of a douchenozzle do you have to be to say that you have ""no patience"" for people who are trying their best to be CF if they live in a society that doesn't provide them with CF options they can use because of racism/colorism/other awful shit???????

I think my favorite thread though has to be this [passive aggressive circlejerk](https://np.reddit.com/r/muacjdiscussion/comments/8wmbgg/can_we_please_talk_about_holierthanthou_cf_people/e1x8jsc/) that happened after I brought up the fact that the holier-than-thou (NOT ALL, the people who act like you're literally Hitler if your makeup collection isn't entirely CF) CF people never ever talk about the rampant human rights violations that go into both the production and making of makeup, which makes you wonder how pure their motivations and morals are.

"e9gtu0b","It's changing norms and mores (more-ays, not plural of ""more""). There are always reasons to say a certain word is or is not offensive. Calling somebody ""retarded"" was just lame slang until maybe twenty years ago. Ten years before that, ""mentally retarded"" was a technical term, considered proper and non-judgmental. Now, it's generally considered offensive, because it is thought to be unkind to people who are... uh... well, you know...

You've got to keep up with changing norms and mores. That's difficult or impossible if you live around people who don't normally speak English.

""Retarded"" is generally considered offensive. I'm not sure about idiot, imbecile and moron. That might depend on the subculture. Sensitive, refined people who are committed to never offending anyone, ever, might consider those words off-limits. Outside those circles, people who would frown on ""retarded"" might be comfortable with those other words, which also mean developmentally disabled, just as ""retarded"" does.

As the decades pass, I don't because more or less compassionate, but the list of words I'm careful not to use is constantly changing. A few decades ago, using ""fucking"" as an adverb was unacceptable in most circles. As in, ""That's fucking ridiculous."" Now, it might be a little rude, but it won't horrify anybody, except in formal settings. Using ""fucking"" as a verb is much less acceptable.

It's sort of like euphemism creep. ""Toilet"" used to be a euphemism for ""Privy."" Privy was a euphemism for... I don't know... ""The hole in the ground where we all shit."" Or something... Now ""restroom"" or ""bathroom"" is a euphemism for ""toilet."" As in, ""I have to go to the bathroom."" And so on. This led to the joke in the Beatles move, ""A Hard Day's Night,"" where one of the Beatles says, ""Excuse me, where is the euphemism?"" (That's an approximate quote, and the movie might have been ""Help."")

&amp;#x200B;

Listen, have empathy for your wife even though she seems to be hurting you remorselessly. From the description of your sex life and the origins of your relationship, it sounds like your wife is missing something that she can't find in you. She didn't get to experience seriously dating anyone else or sexually experimenting with different people to see what she likes. That's part of self-exploration and she missed it. She's being irresponsible with your feelings, but maybe it's because she hasn't gotten a chance to live for herself and explore that side of herself. That being said, you might just want different things out of a relationship right now. I know that's hard to hear, 

&amp;#x200B;

The reason why divorce is off the table for you is the same reason why you're in a relationship in which your partner is willing to hurt you without fear of recourse. Part of being a man is having the emotional self-reliance to get people out of your life when they have crossed your boundaries. You probably have some understandable fears about being alone, you've never been alone in your entire adulthood. But that's an important part of growing up, and something you may benefit from more than you think you will.

&amp;#x200B;

I think you should ask your wife to set aside a period of time where you can talk alone-- somewhere quiet without distractions --and see if she would be willing to do a trial separation without an expectation to get back together.  You're both going through what a lot of people who romantically committed while very young go through.  Have a compassionate, but realistic conversation about ending the relationship, at least temporarily. If you both find that the things aren't better on the other side after living separately and seeing other people, then you'll  feel  more certain in your relationship going forward. If you don't, you'll have avoided being in a relationship with the wrong person. Divorce doesn't have to be an angry nightmare with court mandated exploitation. Treat your wife like a friend who you love who is going through some shit, and make your needs/feelings clear to her, if you end it end it Kindly and tell her what you're afraid of.  Unless she's really a psychopath, she's not going to bleed you for cash if you are kind to her. There's such a thing as a loving divorce, believe it or not. Sometimes two people realize they have some needs they need to meet outside the relationship-- even if it's triggered by someone going way out of line, you can step back and try to figure out what's going on at the root and what she's needing feeling to cause it.

I believe trump is trying to ‘correct’ this imbalance and create an effective deterrent. Immigrants believe they’ll be AOK running the border. He wants to prove them wrong.

Also...think about it. Thousands are coming, in what plays on the news as an invasion. Despite this, we’re supposed to play by rules that only we follow. What message does it send the world that we will tolerate a horse crossing over our borders? As a corollary, putting a bunch of slain ‘invaders’ on the news, despite the backlash, sends a clear and distinct message to immigrants.

I don't see how you aren't getting that there's a difference between letting her kill someone and making it about having the moral high ground. The response is to say ""Katara, I know how hurt you are. You really need to think this over though. Let's talk through why you feel like you need to kill Yon Rha."" Instead Aang just says ""you need to forgive him"" and keeps repeating it. If someone I loved was that upset about killing the person that murdered their mother, I wouldn't go straight to ""well you should forgive them."" It's not helpful to the person and ignores that they have every right to feel as angry as they like. If they choose not to forgive that person, that's fine. That doesn't mean they murder them either. It just means that they're allowed to sit with their anger as long as they need.

I'm not saying her anger was correct or fine either. I feel like you're assuming I support Katara in murdering Yon Rha, when I'm actually arguing that you can give someone emotional support without agreeing with what it is they want to do about those emotions. Katara has a lot of anger, and it's not out of character or ridiculous for her to feel this strongly. I compared her previous anger to say why, in a case that is more exaggerated and has more emotional stake for Katara, this anger she feels isn't out of character. Of course she feels a murderous rage towards a literal murderer. That doesn't mean she gets to go and kill him, but it does mean Aang should acknowledge that she can't just let that anger go.

&gt; the motherly and compassionate Katara

I hate this characterization of her. If Katara was fine being motherly and compassionate, she wouldn't have dueled Pakku so she could learn to fight. In the first episode she gets so angry at Sokka that she breaks open an ice berg. Katara is kind and nurturing and compassionate, but she's more than a motherly figure. It's reductive to claim that. There's literally an entire conversation where Sokka says Katara was basically forced into a motherly role after losing her mom and that she missed out on having fun and being a kid as a result of that.

Aang is holding her to monk standards, and that's unfair to Katara. She doesn't have to forgive Yon Rha (in fact, she outright claims she doesn't), but she shouldn't kill him. Aang is so focused on the monk's desire for peace and forgiveness that he ignores that Katara isn't for that.

This entire thread is about ""does Aang support Katara?"" and I'm answering that he doesn't give her the emotional support she needs. If he did, she'd feel better after talking to him (or at least not more frustrated). Aang being right about not murdering people doesn't make him a good source of emotional support for Katara.",1540984419,"that doesn't mean she gets to go and kill him, but it does mean aang should acknowledge that she can't just let that anger go.  &gt; the motherly and compassionate katara  i hate this characterization of her.","motherly and compassionate","compassionate",NA,FALSE,"motherly and compassionate","motherly",NA,NA,0

"e8mpmx6","Some of my favourite Tywin scenes are those with Arya, he seems fairly warm and paternalistic in his dealings with her, I suspect she reminds him of a young Cersei with her desire to fight and love of female heroines of yore. 

You could make an argument that the Lannisters are the dark mirror of the Starks.  Both Tywin and Ned prize honour and family first and foremost, but it expresses in different ways. 

Tywin is obsessed with legacy and what you leave behind for your future lineage to the point that he disconnects from his children's desires and needs sacrificing the now for future generations. 

A Lannister pays his debts encapsulates his philosophy - it speaks to their being the richest bloodline and that it is more important to present a good face to the world and that you will be beholden to no one. So in Tywin's grand plans he would have forged alliances with two other houses Cersei marries Robert and he would have married Jamie to House Tully if he had wed Lyssa Arryn. 

Ned Stark on the other hand is if anything a bit too indulgent with his children, and too enamoured with integrity at all costs. Ned allows Arya to have sword lessons, even though he intends for her to have a traditional life and marry well, setting her up to run wild and impulsive. Sansa is encouraged to be ladylike but this leaves her vulnerable and naive to political machinations, and marriage to Joffrey who she initially sees as her storybook prince.. 

The most crucial one is Jon Snow, Ned' s compassion potentially creates a rift in his own marriage as he lies to protect his nephew by passing him off as his bastard, even though it stains his honour. Ned teaches his children that ""he who passes the sentence should wield the sword"", we see this come to fruition with Robb, Jon and even Theon. If Ned hadn't tried to save Cersei and Jamie's children by tipping his hand to Cersei he might not have been murdered. 

In terms of dark mirrors - Tyrion is similar to Jon Snow, ""all dwarves are bastards in their father's eyes"", both are compassionate, but keen strategists. Arguably Tywin's neglect has made Tyrion the best of the Lannisters. 

Cersei is a mix of Arya's wild, headstrong nature, coupled with Sansa's ladylike demeanour and romantic longings that have become a twisted hunger for true power untempered by mercy, and someone who is not above using court politics to get what she wants. You see Sansa adapting more of Cersei's cunning by the time she makes it back to Winterfell she has become tempered by her time with the Lannisters. 

Jamie is a dark mirror of Robb. Proud fighters, loyal to their houses but both undone by giving in to their hearts desires rather than being sensible and carrying through with arranged marriages, one joins the Kingsguard to have an excuse to stay ""faithful"" to his sister and the other dooms himself and his family by reneging on his promise to marry into the Freys.

"e8knzeg","No matter what you do, you need to understand that it is not your responsibility to manage your mom's emotions. Your mom sounds very codependent. Please do some reading on that so that you can have a better approach to your relationship with her. You need to set strict boundaries with your mother, or she will smother you. Please never feel bad about setting boundaries with anyone. If they love and respect you they will want to respect your boundaries so that you can continue having a relationship. It is super important that you start setting boundaries about your life and your baby before baby comes. Otherwise she will attempt to overstep boundaries while you are at your most vulnerable. Explain to your husband what your wishes and boundaries are so that he can protect you while you are at your most vulnerable and so that he can back you up always. You have to tell your mother explicitly that you do not want her to move closer, and that if she were to move closer that it would damage your relationship. She needs to know that you would not be any close and would not spend anymore time than you already do even if she moved to be closer to you. She is an adult and needs to respect the kind of relationship her kids choose to have with her. 

Your mother made you her confidant after your after your father died. That was really inappropriate and codependent. Your mother put her emotions on you and made you responsible for her emotions from a very young age. I am very impressed with you. You survived that and have been able to distance yourself even though your mother made you the person she was codependent with, and the person she made responsible for her emotions. You have done really well so far. Keep doing a great job and do not feel bad when you establish your boundaries about the physical distance between you, the emotional distance between you, your life, and now your baby. You mentioned that she is now taking on one of your siblings friends for her codependency. Be aware that she will attempt to build a codependency with your baby. She will make your baby the reason she is happy or sad. This will affect you because she will want more access than you are comfortable with, and dammit, a baby should not be used as prozac or a crutch! 

Tell your mom straight out that she is not to call YOUR baby, her baby or our baby. You just aren't comfortable with that and she needs to respect it. She needs to know that you will not be seeing her more often now that you have a baby. You are happy/comfortable with the level of contact that you have and that will not be changing. She will not be dropping in and she will not be staying in your home when she is allowed to visit. You will not be changing the amount of contact you have by phone, text, messaging service, facetime, email, etc. You will not be answering daily texts or anything. You will have a baby to take care of and that will be taking up your time. You will contact her when you have time. 

Whatever you do, please set up all the boundaries that you need now, before this goes any further and you get more upset with her, and before baby comes. I know it's hard when we have been managing someone's emotions for so long and we didn't even know that is what we have been doing. I have been there. But it is so critical for our happiness to do it as soon as possible. Remember that if she loves and respect you that she will not throw a fit about your setting down a boundary that will make your life easier. She is your mother and she should want what is best for you as YOU dictate it to be, not what she thinks is best. You are an adult and deserve to be respected. She is codependent and overly emotional. She is going to get her feelings hurt no matter what you say, no matter how you say it. So be clear, compassionate, but blunt. You want to be clear so that she does not read into something and make her own conclusions about what you mean. Be very clear in what you mean. Whatever you do, do not JADE(Justify,Argue,Defend,Explain). You do not have to JADE. These are your rules because this is your life. A normal, respectful person will not ask you to JADE, and you should not be expected to JADE. If you JADE, this only gives her something to latch onto and she will argue the point.

The context is also that Voldemort was on his first rise at the time. Snape was openly preparing to join a terrorist insurgency aimed at creating a brutal totalitarian dictatorship...and murdering people like Lily, James, and their families. It's not a normal school rivalry. 

I sympathize with the little boy Severus in his miserable home. But the 15-16yo Nazi wannabe being hated? Gee, how awful that people are mean to the guy who wants a big magical swastika tattoo and to run around torturing and murdering them. 

The other thing is that we get no context. You can make most characters look awful if you just show one or two scenes.

"e7xfzgv","If you read this screaming 'I'm left wing but this isn't me' then we can empathise together about the indignation of being labelled incorrectly (I'm not a racist, homophobe or uneducated bigot because I find myself having to vote right wing these days).

I am a liberal conservative (no capitalisation) who finds myself pushed into strongly supporting right wing parties for some of the following reasons AND perceptions:

1 - Many left wing ideas are naive  - seemingly moral and compassionate - but not workable (I'm talking some of the communist ones/extreme ideas not so much the general socialist ones). They lack the crucial aspect of compromise and pragmatism. Example - unilateral nuclear disarmament. Only works if everyone does it and electing a left wing leader who will unilaterally do it is not something I can ever support. I find that many ideas - despite being lauded as intelligent and educated - are actually naive and idealistic, especially when held by the very young. Ideas learnt in the classroom and nurtured with cut and paste posters don't translate into actual real world scenarios. Preaching against hatred and inequality is great but rings hollow and is hypocritical when some in the left support Islam and paint the generally tolerant, easy-going bulk of society as right wing nutters who variously 'ruin the world for the young' or are 'stupid' or too 'privileged'.

2 - The left seems more interested in victims and creating new subdivisions of victims than it does in the idea of personal responsibility. It does not talk very much about personal success, achievement , hard work or meritocracy (even though if you present the argument in the correct manner you'll find most people actually really believe these principles regardless of political persuasion.) It presents policies that are all about forcing equality via inequality (minority employment group lists etc.) The left talks about policies that are totalitarian and scarily close to thought policing (I don't use FB anymore just in case I say anything in joke or out of conviction that someone can get offended by and so endanger my employment.) I do not feel safe with left wing extremist policies or with those chomping at the bit to report anything that triggers their offence buttons. The left has no victim end game - if it ever runs out of groups to 'identify , publicise , be outraged for and protect' it will simply make up some more, history is replete with injustice to stir up people about. 

3- The left feels like a militant cult where everyone is trying to be more morally correct and virtuous than the next person. It is highly judgemental of any dissent and often can be seen cannibalising itself in self-righteous fury (looking at you UK Labour party.) It preaches noisy outrage as a first call and direct action as its second. Found a statue that you literally didn't know what it meant yesterday and don't like for some reason  - pull it down - to heck with anyone else's feelings or who is paying for the damage. Now just as we all deep down know that the vast majority of right wing thinkers aren't literally Nazis (who would share a lot of common beliefs with extreme left wing thought) we all know that most left wing thinkers won't act like this but the visible face of the left often does. The UK Labour party I have voted for in the past has been changed into a Labour party I could never support. I do not want to live in the dystopia that left wing thought control wants. Watching an advert / new TV series now on TV has become a politically correct (in my eyes left wing) cliche as you can see how hard they have tried to include the right number of minority elements, just enough gayness, just enough empowered women and the correct number of disparaging anti-male, anti-white ideas to meet the vocal Zeitgeist. TV is becoming duller and more inauthentic and processed with every ethics committee meeting and equality commissioner used. Humour is getting poorer (right bad, orange Trump - hehehe) and stale. This is not the vibrant , diverse , free world I want to live in.

4 - The left can easily be *perceived* as immature and filled with emotionally unstable people because its visible face is largely made up of people with low responsibility who talk a lot, march a lot, shout a lot, sometimes riot but don't contribute much. A large number of students plus a sprinkling of vacuous celebrities  - who have largely been given everything for free in their life - shouting about how they want more isn't a good optic. Most people lucky enough to live in developed countries know what it is like to go through university / struggle pay the rent / go through the change of finding out who you are. They know that the roller coaster emotional ride of youth and the idealistic indulgence is not where most people end up. Once you have a family and a job you care about other things than &lt;some new fashionable, victim group&gt;.

5 - The left is packed with extremism and unlike the extremism of the far right it directly threatens me - a generally centrist thinker. The left doesn't want more jobs (I don't see it praising high employment), it wants those in work to pay more for those who it portrays as victims. It wants to force me to take financial responsibility for people who already have their basic needs met. There will always be outlier tragedies where the system fails people but the vast majority - at least in the UK - are not starving, have a home, have free education, free healthcare and have opportunities to better themselves. The ultimate financial aim of the left is to utterly control the distribution of resources via a centralised system. While I am disgusted by the corporate greed of capitalism I am more scared of government centralisation. I feel that many in the left are itching for a physical revolution - a re-run of the French Revolution and a tacit embrace of all the horror that follows. 

6 - The media left does not want to address my concerns as much as it wants to make Trump jokes. Dangerous ideologies such as Islam, the loss of free thought and freedom of expression, unregulated immigration, the need for a strong military, the importance of nuclear family, the need for personal responsibility, the importance of law and order etc.

7 - An awful lot of left wing thinking seems to be virtue signalling. One of my basic life rules is that someone who talks a lot about a certain issue is often someone most culpable of the failings being preached about (e.g. the anti-gay stance of certain US preachers). I see many in the left as  anti-white anti-racists, anti-men equality advocates and anti-wealth anti-poverty supporters. It all seems very Animal Farm to me. Too many basically good, honest people being taken for a ride by the extreme left causing a push back from the remaining basically good, honest people who have to go right lest the dangerous elements of the left win. What the world needs is some much better centralist, pragmatic parties unencumbered by the supposed moral superiority of either side and able to pick sensible, workable solutions that help make/keep society a fair, meritocracy. Too many needed policies that the majority would embrace get rejected because they come wrapped with a ton of ideological garbage.

1. Discussing why she is there (the fact that she rocks up 5 years later with basically no warning makes me think something is happening/has happened). Tbh alot will depend on this conversation and how open she is willing to be.
2. Work out a plan with her in regards to how she can seek help, this could include family members, other friends, a google search for stuff in her area.
3. Probably the most important one for you is talking about her leaving and when this needs to happen, including the steps you will take if she doesnt leave, including police involvement if necessary. Explain exactly why she needs to leave, be compassionate but firm.

You're right. It's a good thing that you're caring and compassionate. But you also need to be caring and compassionate to *yourself*. Set aside time to do an activity that relaxes you, but probably not an activity in which you're forced to spend large amounts of time alone in silence with an unengaged mind. Maybe watch one of your favorite movies, or engage in an activity that is relaxing but requires some attention on your part. Tactile activities often help me. Distraction is not a bad thing.

Another thing. If you're stressed about something small you can easily take care of but have been putting off, make an appointment with yourself and take care of it as soon as possible. It will only clutter your mind.

Most importantly, I would caution you; if the chest tightness and racing thoughts are persistent and it's something that's actually interfering with your daily activities, you may want to see a doctor.

Key points should be:

- what are the consequences he's facing now?
- can this affect his chances at college, employment, renting an apartment?
- even in states where it's legal, schools and employers often have strict requirements about marijuana use. He could lose a job, a scholarship, or be put on academic probation for using even in states where it's legal.
- if he gets in trouble in the future, will this increase the chances of harsher treatment?
- some people are very prejudiced against illegal drug user of any kind. What might this prejudice look like for him in the future? Dating, socially, etc.

Point out that it's not whether he agrees with the law or not. The law exists, and to have the kind of life and opportunities he might want in the future he needs to be more responsible about his choices. We all have to follow rules we might not like or agree with to get the chances in life that we want.  His choices may eliminate some of those options, not just for now but forever.

Offer to have a conversation about your feelings surrounding pot use, and your friends feelings. Make sure he has the information he needs to make the best choices he can, for himself not for you. Be prepared for him to disagree with you, and be ready with compassionate but concerned responses.

"e7bgix8","I tend to agree with you. My thoughts on the topic are too complicated for me to wanna get into right now, but here’s an anecdote that might illustrate what you’re getting at. 

As a teenager, I was homeless off and on for the better part of three years. I generally hated panhandling and I’d avoid it unless I was really desperate. People can be amazingly generous and compassionate, but it also invites a lot of abuse that just wasn’t worth dealing with; especially being a young girl out on my own, getting propositioned and stuff like that. 

People would also offer me stuff unsolicited pretty regularly, which was very kind, of course; but a lot of the time it’d be stuff that I didn’t need at the moment and had no way of carrying around. One particular time, a car pulled over as I was walking down the street and asked me if I was hungry. I said I was, and they offered me a bag of groceries, a loaf of bread, a bunch of cans of beans and veggies, a box of snack crackers, a quart of milk, other odds and ends. I appreciated that, it’s frankly just nice to be acknowledged as a human being, but I had no way to carry that much food, no way to cook it, no way to store anything that didn’t fit in my backpack. 

Not wanting to waste the food that I knew I wouldn’t be able to carry, I took out a few cans of tuna, some bread, and some apples. The lady was irate, yelling at me about how if I didn’t take it all it proved I wasn’t in need, my being a scam artist who only wanted money for booze, etc etc. She ended up demanding back the tuna and bread, and as she drove away threw a handful of change out the window at me. I wasn’t rude at all, I was always gracious when a stranger interrupted their day to try and help out, and I had at no point asked for money, or anything for that matter. 

Many similar situations came up over the years. 

Now that I’ve got a pretty decent life for myself, I give people money when I can. I don’t really give a fuck if they’re buying booze or drugs, lots of people on the streets are mentally ill/have addiction issues, way bigger problems that they’re going to be dealing with at the end of the day regardless of weather or not my dollar “enables” them.

As one of his last acts in office, Governor Jerry Brown of California has vetoed AB 186, which would have allowed safe injection sites in San Francisco.

[Safe injection sites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safe_injection_sites) are legally-sanctioned facilities in which addicts can inject or otherwise consume drugs indoors; they provide sterile works and a safe place. The main motivating factor was the [piles of dirty needles](https://www.nbcbayarea.com/investigations/Diseased-Streets-472430013.html) littering the streets.

Safe injection sites are one of those technocratic solutions, like [revenue-neutral carbon taxes](https://www.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/comments/9kdkzo/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_october_01/e6zhmvt/), which it's sadly very hard to get love for.

From the right:

&gt; The Trump administration warned that if California allowed the sites, those involved could be subject to civil and criminal action. 

From the left:

&gt; [Brown said in a veto message](https://www.gov.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/AB-186-veto-9.30.pdf) that “enabling illegal drug use in government sponsored injection centers” with no requirement of treatment is “all carrot and no stick.” “Enabling illegal and destructive drug use will never work,” Brown wrote. “The community must have the authority and the laws to require compassionate but effective and mandatory treatment.”

In Canada, safe injection sites have been associated with [decreased overdose mortality, fewer HIV infections, and fewer ambulance calls to respond to overdoses](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5685449/). A [literature review](http://sifnyc.injectingadvice.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/SIF-NYC-Research-Brief.pdf) by SIF NYC finds similar results.

"e6oxlvd","&gt;is this closer to the heart of it than pretending not to be mad?

For me it was a part of the process, insofar as there was one and the process had anything to do with Zen that is. Letting all the harsh and generally unpalatable emotions flow and be as they will, not suppressing them, allowed me to more clearly see where they come from and how they operate. In a way it made me less blind to myself. 

After a while letting it all go and be expressed as it wished to be, I could more clearly see what all these emotions stemmed from. I'm still learning about my emotional patterns but it made it more visible to let all the pent up stuff out. At the end of the day empathy plays a large role in actually dealing with stuff when the worst of that is passed though. Trying to understand what's actually going on. 

You could probably do that too with all the harsh emotion flowing through your system but it would take a lot more attention and determination I imagine. 

Now a couple of disclaimer, to me this sounds like mindfulness, which I think is related to Buddhism but more specifically deals with how to live a balanced and healthy life. Mostly through things like compassionate but determined self-examination. Seeing patterns gives you a choice of what to do with them, is one of the main thrusts of mindfulness training. Or just mindfulness as paying attention isn't something which degrees have much bearing on. 

I think generally letting emotions flow is good. It is often the case however that we find ""caches"" or stores of repressed or pent up emotion from our past make their way to the surface when we allow this. This takes careful handling in that the main way to deal with this is see, experience, let it be in all of its sometimes ugly countenance, but also let it pass if you notice that acting on it wouldn't be helpful to the situation. They tend to be reactions to things long past after all and acting on them now would just make more stuff that needs dealing with.

"e6mkath","You know I am starting to find her the most interesting character of the story. You truly don't know if she's ""*evil*"" or not. One could sure say she is; she's beaten, tortured, and executed people before. But you could also say that, she is a victim herself, she doesn't have a choice much like all the other women of Gilead. If she doesn't do her duties like the rest of them, she'll be hung from a noose. We've had multiple instances now where she seemed beyond genuinely upset at the world around her. The time they had foreign delegates visit and they made them remove all the ""defective"" handmaid's from the room, she seemed both genuinely pissed and upset. Like, these women put up with a lot of shit to be handmaids, and now they're not allowed to be part of this big event for Gilead? The time whatsherface was gonna be stoned, it looked like she really didn't want to order it, and she was crying when the handmaid's were forced to stand in the rain holding stones. And the time she told June about her goddaughter who died. Like, that's heresy for someone like her to ever talk about times before the war. 

Of course, none of that means she isn't evil; she could be compassionate, but still loyal to Gilead in the end. Everyone here seems to be so hellishly brainwashed into their ideologies. Her character was, to our knowledge, not as essential as Serena's in overthrowing the United States however. So there could be hope for her character and her true intentions. Someone (like her) HAS to crack over time. Serena I think is too brainwashed and too involved at a higher level. But Lydia, she's the kind of person that could have an outsider perspective on it. What they're doing to these women, how the commanders treat them, how women (including herself) are constantly oppressed. She could form a small resurgence out of all her handmaids. Think if every handmaid murdered their commander the damage it would do to their government. 

We've already seen Nick betray Gilead. We seen a glimpse of his backstory. He never really cared for Gilead. He just wanted a job, literally. He got lucky meeting someone that was a higher-up in the sons of Jacob at a job recruiting center thing. Could be the same thing with Lydia; she may have never been a part of the uprising.

You could then reflect the whole situation of treaties forming the AOG more by either adding rather autonomous inland warlords and more integrated coastal puppets with the AOG only directly controlling the major cities and land around them + a few harbours or fortification points against the Japanese making all of these AOG directly owned cities and military centres their own provinces or just add debuffs.
The AOG could then either go with a more liberal path ruling indirectly or more harshly trying to directly integrate these puppets leading to various wars with them and or strong debuffs. 
All the while these subjects could choose to remain loyal lessening the burden of integration while getting a lot of buffs and or more / full autonomy, side with the Qing, rebel and go independent, side with the Republicans, side with the Japanese or maybe even go with glorious Ungern. 

Military would be a bit separate but of course the AI would go with a more logical path fitting their location and leader as with most of these the player though could decide between volunteer forces, mass chinese army with german officers, liberal free mixed army or mostly German army with the still rather large chance of loyal Chinese soldiers and officers being integrated into said army. I believe that Germany would become even more liberal in the officer department after witnessing the great success of non noble officers in the Great War. 

There would also be an enornous need of good officers or really officers at all to lead troops and to maybe even govern some of the provinces so the rulers of these subjects would not only be Chinese warlords I would imagine them to be more represented in the inland with most of being either Nationalists or Monarchist and only a rather small percentage of them Syndicalist or Populist. German military governors would be governing more loyal provinces near the coast. I have no idea how many subjects you could possibly add without affecting but I guess like 6, 8, 10? would be nice to show the split nature of China better. 

Also add Germanisation similar to the Baltic states because this... https://orig00.deviantart.net/8642/f/2018/117/8/6/prussian_china_by_arminius1871-dc9kc9q.png
Would be cool to use these names but that's all just my Lebensraum German and Cheaboo speaking. 
Asia really isn't fleshed out while it was considering even recent world history one of the most important if not even the second most important theatre after Europe so yeah if you add some stuff there then consider the nature of the states and add some uniformity there. 


GER / AOG / GEA / MAF
German East Asia is basically a Navy with a Country, AOG is a Company with a Country and Mittelafrika is a handful with a continent. The German Empire is in Kaiserreich the largest nation that has ever existed in human history and it should be reflected in the nation itself and its subjects while also taking the German character into the whole equation.
Germans aren't proud, brutal, stubborn
Germans are efficient, pragmatic(which could be seen as brutal), organized, traditional, innovative and cynical. 
Germans are split between Catholics and Lutherns which are compassionate but also efficient missionaries and assimilators. 
These are just some but I think that these should be the first thing to be considered when designing a faction to act. This of course also applies for all other nations but I feel as if that factor was a bit pushed aside in the design of German nations as well Germany was probably one of the first countries to be created when the sheer scope of this project wasn't really an issue yet. 

I know people are always talking about Germany and Germany and Germany even though you're already adding that much to them and they're probably the most fleshed out nation overall but well they're the protagonist of this whole thing even more than they were in WW2. So yeah would be kinda nice of there was more to do beyond 1940/41/42.

"e687a61","Yeah. I can confirm. I was messing around with my SO before going back to BYUI after my mission. I'm an adult convert so I didn't have the youth conditioning. I confessed the first time, but it kept happening, I didn't confess any future fooling around. She was pissed off at me for breaking it off before leaving for BYUI. After about a month of being there, she tells my home ward bishop. Word gets to my BYUI leadership and they call me in. I try and play it off like ""yeah, that totally happened, and I confessed and took care of it back home."" Then they call me out and say ""she said this happened after the time you confessed"", so I think, shit, I'm busted, better just come out with it, be honest, and maybe they'll be leaniant. So I confess the whole thing. Then the bishop suggests ""are you sure that this isn't just an angry ex girlfriend that is trying to get you into trouble?  Because we all understand how that happens"". In effect encouraging me to lie, but me, still believing in 90% of what they're selling, chose to be honest and say ""that may be what is encouraging her to confess, but it doesn't change that it's true that we fooled around."" So cue disciplinary counsel at the stake level and me securing acceptance letters from other universities and transcripts just to cover my ass. Go through the motions with a lot of scary words and I can't take the sacrament for four months, I have to turn in my temple recommend, they give me ""the miracle of forgiveness"" to read, and as long as I don't relapse in that time, they won't give me the boot. It still amazes me that the bishop was encouraging me to lie, blame the girl, and get off (no pun intended) scott free.

Another part you power hungry local leader hating types might enjoy. Before my disciplinary council, the stake president set up a meeting with me in order to ""get to know me"" since we barely knew our bishops, much less the stake presidents at the school. So I get in there with my story rehursed to make sure I wasn't going to give any contradicting information that he would have gotten from the bishops. I get there all ready to be the meek little ""yes sir/no sir"" guy expecting him to be helpful, compassionate, but disappointed. Not what happens at all. This sack of shit was so puffed up and condescending to me, essentially accusing me of robbing God's church by going to BYUI while being unworthy, blah blah blah. He was loving throwing his authority around. So after about 15 minutes of listening to this asshat spew. I silently pull my other acceptance letters from several other universities, some with substantial scholarships attached (which would actually make going there cheaper than BYUI for me). I line them up on the table facing him. And meekly say ""I'm here because I want to be, not because I'm forced to be. If this is how I'm going to be treated by the Lord's anointed, I've got better pave l places to go."" I loved watching his power trip rug get ripped right out from under him.

"e5u3hfr","Some random points:

Supporting conservative or liberal causes, or identifying as either is a choice.

Race, sexuality, gender, country of origin, and religion (for the most part) are all unchosen.

Comparing the bullying of conservative by liberals, or the bullying of liberals by conservatives to conservative attitudes and policies that negatively affect certain races, sexualities, genders, nationalities and religions is a bit disingenuous.

Yes, liberals bully conservatives, but conservatives bully liberals as well. I'm just one person, but my facebook feed is filled with toxic attitudes from each to the other in nearly equal proportions, including blocking, silencing, personal attack.

Re: liberals bullying 'stupid' conservatives: 

Stupid or not, at some point people must be held accountable for their actions/beliefs/rhetoric. Yes, I might feel bad for someone with extreme right wing political leanings when they are clearly underserved and consequently uneducated. But some basic concepts, like live and let live, don't mock people for the innate tendencies etc are so readily learned in society. 

I can forgive my great uncle for having a poor grasp of social programs, the benefits of public healthcare, or financial policies, stuff like that.

"e5kv89p","I have somewhat of a background in contract/insurance/warranty disputes, so here are some tips to help you. (Head of disputes resolution at an international transport brokerage was my job for a few years.)

Do you have the warranty contract available? You really need to go through it to know what your options are.

I bought an $1000 fridge about five years ago. It's compressor got a pinhole in it, so it stopped cooling. We had the estimate and parts and labor came out to more than the purchase price of re-buying the fridge brand new. They wanted to buy me out for a prorated $375. I pulled out the contract and it read that they had to either pay for the repair or the cost of a replacement. Given that the fridge and freezer came as a set, the only replacement was the same model, which was still going for $850.  They had to pay the full $850.

Long story short, it's really important what's in that contract. Take a look at two things: what options there are (e.g. repair, prorated reimbursement with or without warranty refund, replacement, etc.) and who has the power to determine the option used.  If the power is in your hands, then you say what you are willing to settle for.

Sometimes the language is ambiguous on the latter, saying things like the ""Company \*may\* do X, Y, Z with the buyer's authorization"". If it is ambiguous, then stay friendly and state how you are reading it. If they want to argue about the meaning, don't get into a semantics war, let it go and follow these tips:

1. Always start out friendly. chat a bit, empathize with them, and, to a reasonable degree, pat their back. Don't start out with what's bothering you. Start out with asking them how their doing and joking around a bit. You shouldn't sound agitated or in a rush.
2. When you do breach the subject, keep it about the matter at hand and impersonal. If you sense some resistance or defensiveness, try to bring it back down. Use your tone and your non-nonchalance to let them know you're relaxed with them and you know their just doing their job and following company guidelines. You're looking for a mutual resolution. Stay focused on the big picture of what happened and what logic there is behind your claim, not whose to blame or who did what. Be sparing with details.
3. If you still get resistance, let them know again that you know they have to do their job and you can sympathize with working with so many different people all day, many of which are probably in bad moods. Reassure them that you know it's the policy that is causing an issue and then ask to be kicked up to someone higher up who might have the authority to make policy decisions in the company. (Try to avoid the word ""manager"".)
4. If you're still having no luck and you've hit the managerial ceiling (for that particular call) and can't go any higher, then you stay friendly, but you directly state your course of action is. In a serious, but impersonal and polite way, ask for their legal department's contact information. It might seem hard to sound nice when doing this, but you can do it. ""I understand you can't change the policy and you have to do your job. I admire that. Could you give me the legal department's address or connect me with someone who will have that information."" This should sound almost monotone because you want it to be clear that this isn't your first rodeo and you're not really phased. When they ask why you want that, stay polite and calm, reassure them that you can see they are doing their job and you have no beef with them, but you spoke with the lawyer where you work and he suggested that you send the company a subpoena for small claims and that you also forward them a copy of the complaint you'll be sending to the state authority on the matter (e.g., state board of consumer affairs, state insurance board, etc.).
5. When you draft the complaint for the state board, make sure you use the following phrase: ""I suggest that you audit Company X for the following reasons: ... "" Every state has a board. Just look their name up in advance so that you sound informed. And if it comes to forwarding the company your complaint, make sure it has whatever header or forms the state requires.
6. If you do have to deal with resistance and/or delivering a course of action, then split all this up into at least 3 calls to the company. The first call is to find out what they are thinking about doing. Here you speak to the low-level and mid-level employees. The second call is with the mid-level employee, preferable the one you spoke to last time. You are going to discuss your interpretation of the documentation and, if they aren't going for it, reveal that you'll have to go through small claims and file a complaint with the state. This will make you seem like somewhat of an ass no matter how hard you try to come across friendly, so be friendly and stay nice, but keep the conversation short. And if they get defensive, let them know that you will call back because something's come up. The third call is to the department head, where you chat him/her up. You're relaxed here because you're confident the outcome will ultimately be in your favor. Then explain what happened so far, spoke with the lawyer where you work and the state board, and you asked for the company's legal department.
7. If you run into trouble getting to a higher up because someone starting to get obstinate or defensive, remember that you can always end the conversation with ""Oh, I'm sorry, I have to go right now. Something's come up with work. But is there a name or employee number to get a hold of you when I call back? You've been helpful and I'd rather not go through explaining everything to someone new."" Next time you call, say that that person told you spoke to so-and-so on this date and she said to ask for her supervisor when you called back. The point here is twofold: (a) don't let defensiveness take over the conversation and (b) move up whenever you can.
8. If this information seems reasonably available, you can say that you got in touch with some people who reviewed their company on whatever website and they will be joining the claim. (Don't do this unless it seems very reasonably true.)
9. If you are in a state that allows single-consent phone recording, you can let them know that you are going to use the phone recordings with the employees in the small claims. If they ask why, let them know that there was some conflicting information given and don't say anything else.
10. Finally, document everything. Dates, times, employee names/numbers/extensions for all calls.

In most states it only costs $50 to file a small claims and it is free to file the complaint with the state board, but it will likely never come to that. They know they will need a lawyer and that is more expensive than the repair, especially if it is out of state, and a draft letter to the state board puts the idea of an audit in their head, and that's even more expensive.

The most important thing you can do in any dispute it be friendly and understanding and be direct about your understanding of things and about your course of action. And always always remove agency. When you are on the phone, you never say ""You did X, Y, Z"", but something like ""I know there's the company policy for X, Y, Z, and I understand that you're doing your job as best you can by adhering to it. I think we can agree, though, that the policy isn't fair in this particular case and doesn't reflect the company's good reputation."" You'd never want to help an accusatory, irate jerk, and neither will they.

One last thing, disputes are like poker. The power is in the information: both what you can find out about them and what you can make them believe about you. Regarding splitting up your calls and saying you've been in contact with other claimants, by separating out your conversations, no one is ever stuck on the phone angry or feeling nagged by the same person. Instead, you're always speaking to someone new and higher up.  You can find out a lot about what goes on with the company by doing this, and you always seem like a happy-go-luck person at best and a compassionate, but firm person at worst. You might even find out what other big incidents they might be dealing with if you do little bit of prying (e.g., ""I think this policy was made to protect against big false claims, not small ones like mine.

"e5cezm3","It was a HUGE known issue in the family. Talked about constantly by her and everyone else. It’s actually very difficult for me because my father only ever talks about it and how “diseased” and “sick” she was even now that she’s been dead almost 5 years and they’ve been divorced for almost 20. Not in a compassionate but hateful way. She knew it was a problem and sought help repeatedly throughout her life. First time when I was 8. We were able to have some real discussions about it many times throughout my life as we got along well despite her issues. She did say that the reason she became an alcoholic is because it was “normal” and always around. Family came over? Drinks! Go to a BBQ? Drinks! Dinner party? Drinks! Baby shower, wedding, any holiday, etc.? Drinks! We were part of a huge family that got together constantly at that time and it became a problem for her before she realized what was happening. I suppose the most eye opening moment for me was when I was 13. She had fallen and, because she was so drunk, could not get up. I was the only one home and so I had to get her up. It took a long time and was very difficult because I was maybe 100 lbs and she had to be at least 160. I finally got her up and she was leaning on me and started crying. She said “Do you hate me?” I thought honestly for a second and said “No mom, I don’t hate you.” She replied “I hate me.” I realized then how much emotional pain she was in. I saw her differently after that. She always warned my brothers and I of the dangers of addiction. She’s say “Hard drugs are in your face dangerous. You can get hooked after a time or two. Alcohol is sneaky. You don’t know you have a problem until you already have a problem.” Unfortunately, my younger brother never listened to the warnings and is now a heroine addict and alcoholic. My older brother and I have started clear of it all. So, yeah, the “normalcy” of drinking definitely is a problem in my eyes. It makes people think they are fine... until they aren’t.

Toxic masculinity, in the context of what you've so far told, would be about how men feel entitled to women's emotional support and compassion. There is this trite thing people say about masculinity: that it's stoic and reserved. But that's only half the story---the public story of masculinity.

"e4ghbyf","Rant on sis. I hear you.

My last therapist was an older Stacy..$300 a visit. And my visits were discounted. 

She was compassionate but so beautiful and graceful. I felt like I couldnt talk too long about certain things in fear of boring her since she did not have the same world view. She talked about pressures women face to be beautiful and thin and I just looked at her like ""if u were about this, I may as well jump out the window"". She was so kind but in that way puppies are kind because everyone always cuddles them and give them treats. How could she ever understand the self loathing, the severe avoiding mirrors so much I covered all of mine so I wouldnt be emotionally assaulted when I step into the bathroom in the morning just waking up?

The therapist before her, was a mixed race lesbian who had so many stories parallel mine. Older than me and I wondered if it mattered that the vessel that held the soul I wanted to connect to mattered. Because I am not gay but could totally see myself curling up with a good book by the fireplace with her across reviewing patients notes, living happily ever after. I suppose they call that transference? But it happened because my days were so dark I landed in the hospital and she was the first person I spoke to that I felt heard me. So obviously even that therapist relationship could never last

Skip the therapist before that, she was an older white woman who kept gasping horrified at little slips of my reasons for being in therapy. I get it, I went though some trauma. I am crying on your office. It's a lot. But this was more side show freak than therapy.

One before that,  guy a few years old. Nice, similar backgrounds, fell asleep a few times during therapy, and also we found each other on a dating app. My mom encouraged this. I just wanted to die because he has heard all manners if fucked uo things about me and I dont believe men can last without the illusion anyway.

All this and I have yet to experience a substantial therapeutic effect. I will say that it feels good to have someone sit and listen you you if they seem to actually understand.  I imagine a long term version of this can be helpful. But finding the right therapist is a matter of matching with the right one. If I knew how to match with someone on this dimension - listens, relates, advises is kind, I would just marry dude, give him babies, and cal lm it a day. 

Its alienating and freakish and way worse when you are bogged down with anxiety snd depression. Keeping appointments when u are like that is a feat.

"e4dglq4","&gt; Met this girl back in May.

So you've only known this girl for 4 months.

&gt; The only stressor on the relationship was that she frequently had to cancel dates for family emergencies

This shouldn't be a stressor. This should be when a significant other is supportive and patient. You seeing this as a stressor is a big indicator of whats to come.

&gt; What she added in the text was that she had a panic attack at the hospital because she was afraid of how I would react to another cancellation (important a bit later).

She basically laid it out all up front. She knows you aren't capable of handling this anxiety yourself, and *needed* you to be understanding through this. She was *dreading* dealing with this because of how *you'd* react. That is not a healthy relationship (and it seems she saw that). 

&gt; I tell her I'm so sorry, I understand, that she doesn't have to worry about my reaction, that I hope her sister is okay.

This should have been the end of the conversation. This should have been where you gave space freely, and gave her time.

Instead..

&gt; Saturday goes by and I don't hear from her, so I call her in the evening because I'm sort of freaking out about not having any details about her or her sister. I get a text saying ""[Sister] isn't doing well, please give me time to be with her. I'll talk to you tomorrow.""

&gt; The next morning (last Sunday), I call her

Dude.... give the girl the girl what she asked for. **Space**. She needed time to deal with an actual issue. She should not have had to worry about you freaking out over the fact she's not replying. She's got way more important things going on. This is where I would have personally blocked you. Its a bit smothering. Who are you to *need* to know details of the sisters health? Its okay to be concerned, but demand updates from someone you've known for four months, of a family member you probably have never met? Nice try on the nice guy act, but this is a bit manipulative. You didn't want updates on the sister in reality, you just wanted to hear from your girlfriend. Obviously this four month relationship did not leave you in a place in her mind where she felt she needed to rely on your for comfort/support. There *are* some women who can flat out handle this themselves and prefer to deal with things their own way.

&gt; Can we talk about something, or is now a bad time?

Seriously dude? YES ITS A BAD TIME, SHE SHOULDNT HAVE TO TELL YOU THAT.

&gt; I need you to communicate with me more--I care so much about you and I just need to know what's going on once in a while.

Extremely co-dependent here. You *need* her to communicate more.. Pretty demanding.

&gt; So I talked to my therapist about this...when I was in the hospital, I had a panic attack because I was afraid of how you'd react. That's not how I should have reacted when my sister was bleeding from her head in the hospital. My therapist said you're co-dependent.

The truth you needed to hear.

&gt; You don't want to break up do you?

Escalating the situation. Making a mountain out of a mole hill. 

&gt; I'd literally go through hell for you. I promise that you breaking up with me is the worst thing for my anxiety right now. I love you and I'm here. Whatever you need. I'll fly to Boston if you need. Please don't break up with me.

This just makes you sound extremely needy and manipulative. Not fair buddy, and NOT what you say to someone going through her situation.

&gt; And everything's okay with us? I'm just afraid of waking up one day with a text from you where you break up with me.

Seriously dude, you have turned a legitimate tragedy into something *all* about you. That is what proves to me you don't actually care about the wellbeing of said sister, and just wanted attention from the girlfriend. You are trying to manipulate her into talking to you again.

&gt; Yes. I just want to know how your sister's doing and how you're doing. Do you think you could just text me once a day?

She tried to change the conversation and you brought it right back to a conversation where she previously tried to soothe your worries.

&gt; Then I went to write a message about how she shouldn't worry about me or my anxiety at all, but just focus on her sister. 

So you got her to agree to talk to you, manipulated her into feeling like your anxiety is one of her problems to deal with, and then ~~kindly~~ let her know not to worry about you. The emotional roller coaster of this post, holy cow, I feel so bad for this girl.

&gt; Hi [my name]- I can't continue to date you anymore because I need to focus on my sister and it is more severe than I made it seem. I felt concerned expressing this over the phone when you began to panic and have alerted the police for your safety, as you are in a very fragile headspace.

Quite possibly the best thing she could have done for you, my friend. You *need* help, and truly need to get actively working towards bettering yourself and getting a grip on your anxiety/codependency.

&gt;  I'm going crazy. I want closure. I want to know what happened and I want to know how her sister is doing. I want to know how someone could ghost me ten minutes after saying they loved me. I just want one more conversation with her. I don't know what to do.

Just stop with the sister part dude. You are using this as a way to justify your actions as normal and compassionate, but they are false. Clearly proven by the following sentence. This girl needed space, and you smothered her. 

&gt; She was literally just ripped from me and I have no fucking clue why.

Because you are extremely co-dependent and not mentally stable enough for a healthy relationship. You can't even accept that this was a legitimate choice made by her, instead you see it as her *ripped* from you. Thats such a victim way to look at things.

&gt; And unfortunately I'm blocked and have no way of explaining or apologizing

Are you really absorbing any of the advice given to you? Reaching out and explaining/apologizing is SOOOO not the thing to do. Back to square one of smothering the girl, and not giving her space.

You need to leave this girl alone. 100%. You need to take these issues into your own hands and seek help for yourself. You truly need external help with this or else all of your relationships are going to struggle.

Please, heed all the advice and for the love of god, leave this girl alone.

Edit to add - 

&gt; This is incredibly insightful. Thank you. I am in therapy (I have been for years), and we had both spoken previously about how I was going through a particularly bad rough patch and she mentioned how she would support me through it, not run from it. I guess it got to be too much.

SHE IS NOT RESPONSIBLE IN ANY WAY FOR HANDLING YOUR ANXIETY. I guess it got to be too much? Well since you are relying on other people to fix issues you wont properly address, of course its too much. You obviously need a better therapist. I'd seek a second opinion for sure.

&gt; And (not trying to justify my behavior here, just explaining), 

Yes you are doing exactly that. Justifying your behavior.

&gt; at the time when I was badgering her, I literally had no idea about the severity of the problem. I thought it was a broken or fractured wrist or bump on the head because she didn't give me any other information (which is what I was asking for). In retrospect, the burden I was being is incredibly clear to me.

Who cares about the severity of the problem? Whether she had a paper cut or was in a coma, you should have respected your girlfriends requests of needing time and space with her sister. Its not up to you to decide the severity of the problem.

"e3she96","I would say that mine lasted a little over a year. As for how I got out of it, you never really do. It's a cursed mindset. I was always really closed off, never telling anyone how I felt, not family, friends, never prayed, you get the picture. I sank into a real low when I began missing my toxic relationships and thinking about how I overreacted and cut ties with people I could've learned to accept if I wasn't so paranoid back then. Needless to say, I took a step back and started contacting good friends and praying to God (that's my personal comfort and I know it may not be for everyone). My friends were very blunt and compassionate, but I knew that they couldn't give me answers, so I cherry picked the advice they gave me and applied it to my life. I got on a healthier diet, I did a bit of exercise everyday to clear my mind, I stopped going on social media all together for months, I learned to see when I was over analysing a situation and put my energy elsewhere, I forced myself to work on my obligations (homework) until I got into it wholeheartedly without distractions, I avoided the things that caused me to over think and become dull (i.e. social media, dwelling on the past, trying to do too much for other people, etc), I got on a healthier sleeping schedule rather than staying up all night and sleeping throughout the afternoon, I set small goals for myself to accomplish throughout the month, and the list goes on.

"e3s5274","YES! Boundaries and enforced rules are imperative. A lot of maturity happens when they know what is acceptable and what is not. Otherwise, they are always uneasy not knowing when they may cross the line. Strictness with equal affection and verbal love are vital. Being honest and compassionate, but also firm on self-discipline. Sometimes they get to know why you are asking them to do something, etc, other times, no. Because I said so. Make them work: chores, school work, volunteering. Not necessarily all at once, and teach them to manage money, saving short term and long term. Any skill they will need as an adult, you have to teach them. They aren't born with that knowledge. 

Very important...self care. Hygeine, excercise, eating, and regular doctors checkups and dental cleanings. 

*Most important, God is a loving God who promises to stay with you and walk you through whatever happens in the future. Good times and bad. Sin, separation from God, is, unfortunately part of humankind's life. People make bad decisions that effect others, and evil walks the face of the earth. Between the two, life is difficult. Guaranteed. But, having the reassurance that God is with you and He will help you, relieves a lot of pressure to get everything right. Things can go wrong, you make a bad decision, it will all work out bec God is helping. It may not be what you wanted, but you will have your needs met, and often times things turn out better than you would have imagined. And, things always take longer than you would like. Don't give up on God when it feels like He has abandoned you. You don't know what is going on behind the scenes, what things He has to align for your next step to be successful. Sometimes it is other people He has to make changes in to set things up for you, and people can be particularly stubborn when it comes to change. Growth is a process, be kind to yourself. If you make a mistake, it's ok, even good. You learn from it and move on. 

Last thing, kids need your time, undivided attention. A lot. The old saying, quality time not quantity. Bullshit. You are doing something that is more important than any career or accomplishment. Your time and attention are best spent on raising your child. It is no longer about you. Material comfort is not your goal. Of course, meet needs and splurge on little things occasionally to add fun and break up the monotony. You made a human being that has needs. Now that human is your #1 priority. They didn't chose to be born, but they suffer the consequences of your decisions. You are creating another person, the future...one that will do great things, but, more importantly, will add love, kindness and compassion to our world, AND be an example of doing it right, a representation of of a good citizen, spouse, child, husband, parent. And a representation of the love of God. You sound like a great dad. Your boy is lucky.

"e3qop1a","&gt;I think one the reason might be the type of stories that are written. I feel too many times in Fantasy, female characters are there to ""fit a quota"", for romances purposes, or to help the hero grow. They rarely have their own goals and motivations.

Yeah I agree women are often pigeonholed into very specific kinds of secondary roles that limit how much attention they get as characters. Still, it's not the worst way to write women.

The worst to me, is when they are clearly written to enhance someone else's story, even if they supposedly have their own (I talk about it further down with Susan from Dresden Files). Like the author just doesn't write them having reactions to what happens to them, doesn't spend time on changes in them, everything that happens to them or that they do is somehow to push the main character's narrative, give him feelz, whatever.

It's clear that to the author, they just exist to push the main character or advance the plot, not because they are fully-realized characters on their own. The author (nevermind other characters) doesn't think of them as people, but plotpoints.

There's some books (Chronicles of Amber, maybe) where even though the female characters are very secondary and the main character is self-absorbed, the author still leaves hints and shows in some ways that the women are having their own lives in the background and aren't behaving however is convenient/inconvenient to the main character but according to what is happening to them. That they have their own feelings that aren't related to the dude but are still made visible, so they form personalities. There's even strong hints that the main character doesn't understand them or is lying about them so the reader is invited to form his own opinions about them as people.

Basically it's clear the author thinks of them as people, even if they get very little space on the page, and even if the male character is kind of sexist (which is fine and even entertaining sometimes, when it's not an attitude supported by the author).

&gt;It's difficult to write powerful leaders who are female because they hardly exist in the real world. The ones who are always quoted to have been well designed in fiction, like Ellen Ripley, Sarah Connor or Lara Croft, basically behaved like men with boobs.

Actually, Ripley was a total hero to me as a child, probably the first female character I really felt was a well-written woman. I don't think she's a ""man with boobs"" at all. I liked that she was assertive, and had skills and a job. She had realistic feelings (her fear of going back, her nightmares, her anger, etc) but she didn't just go to pieces when shit hit the fan or let her emotions totally overrule her judgement (although sometimes they came pretty close). She didn't steal the spotlight either, she didn't always know what to do and she often followed the advice and commands of the actual soldiers around her. One thing that was very feminine about her was her motherly relationship to Newt and to her cat in the first movie and her need to protect them and somewhat irrational actions to do so. She was a mother to a child who slept beside her, she fed her and cleaned her and told stories about dolls to her, that's not feminine? What is manly about her in your opinion?

Same with Sarah Conner I didn't feel she was manly, her relationship with Kyle or whatever his name was, was pretty feminine to me. I got the sense she felt compassion for him/his shit life in a feminine way that a man wouldn't. She was just a woman who wasn't a pushover, didn't lose her mind when shit went down. She acted rationally and learned from the dude trying to teach her.

&gt;Female traits are emotion, kindness, compassion, caring. Those are not traits that make leaders though. I honestly can't think of a way to make a fictional leader behave like what we expect a woman to behave like.

I mean would you characterize like... Merkel (German chancellor) like this? There's some quite powerful women irl, Even though they don't literally kick asses, no one gets to ruling a country by just being kind and compassionate and she has never struck me as any of those things in particular. I'd say she's cool, reserved, somewhat sarcastic and calculating.

&gt;I guess that as long as we consider that some traits are masculine, and some are feminine, we'll run into this issue as there will always be expectations on how men and women should behave like. I don't know if we'll ever be able to get rid of it though.

What traits would you consider ""masculine""? Actually, I don't think I would consider male characters that are kind/compassionate/caring as feminine necessarily. Like what about Caz from Curse of Chalion for example, a caring, kind, compassionate parent-like, protective figure. I didn't think he was feminine. I'd call Frodo pretty kind and compassionate but not feminine... So I think these ideas about what's masculine vs what's feminine aren't that set in stone. I guess it's more likely that a woman is compassionate than that a man is maybe? But either way it wouldn't make them be a bad version of their gender.

Women I consider badly written are like... WoT women. Women who are ""strong"" by being a bitch nonstop and whose attitude is just accepted because they are women. I still like some of them (Nynaeve, I think, the wisdom) but my god the ballbreaking is totally unbearable to me. It's like every strong emotion they have translates into being a bitch if a man is nearby.

Or women like Susan in Dresden Files: a basic sexy girlfriend constantly getting into trouble and mostly useless outside that. As soon as she gets her own story, she disappears. Dresden only thinks of her when he's feeling guilty over her, her own point of view is non-existent because she has no thoughts or feelings of her own even though supposedly stuff happens to her that would affect her deeply and change her character. When she reappears the focus is (aside from plot) on her sexy new tattoos, how guilty Dresden is, how much he missed her, and wondering about the dude who's with her (and whether he's her new bf). You get no indication of how Susan might feel or what she's thinking.

Or Susan from Narnia who is ""the girly one"" who likes *gasp* lipstick and boys. Because of that she's disinvited from Narnia at the end of the last book. That was pretty WTF to me.

Or Dinah from Name of the Wind: a woman who is the definition of ""feminine mystique"" (the Betty Friedan version), ie, she's so ""mysterious"" she's not a real person at all, just something for him to chase. She's also bizarrely weak despite being strong. Like Kvothe she has some real talents as an entertainer and she's seemingly better than him at making people like her and ""street-smarts"". But she's constantly in some mess and constantly running away from it. The impression I get of her is she's whatever she's needed to be at the moment, not a person with her own story (even if Kvothe doesn't know that story). Just a mess of a non-character.

Or Vin from mistborn. She's ""strong"" but she can't just be *normally* strong, she has to be the best at every skill. She learns all those skills faster than anyone, too. She's supposedly emotionally damaged from isolation and behaves really rudely and irresponsibly, but everyone loves her. Reactions to her are not realistic at all. No one just doesn't like her or is indifferent to her, she impresses every good guy. Multiple guys fall in love with her even though she's standoffish and supposedly plain and malnourished. She has few flaws that are actually acknowledged, and whenever she does something wrong, even if it leads to catastrophic failure, no one criticizes her.

"e3hosza","I'm a little late, but perhaps someone will see this. The answer to any value judgement (morality religion culture politics) is: superiority (good truth devoloped success) is an illusion. Are you so desperate to be a 'good guy' that you are wiling to accept that others are bad? Morality is the cause of immoral behavior. Humans aren't naturally evil, generally we are kind and compassionate. But, once society gets you to identify with a shared value system then anything can be justified.

Democracy is good, therefore consent to democracy is unnecessary. Theocracy is bad therefor democracy must be limited by a constitution, guaranteeing certain values are protected. In reality, democracy is tyranny of the hive mind; War is morally necessary; theft is for equality; love is conditional and limiting; support is used to oppose freedom; success is measured by claiming others are failures; and religions actively distribute the forbidden fruit: knowledge of good and evil.

There are no problems except for the problem of choice. All choices you make are correct, all choices you don't make are also correct. Just be sure not to die, then you'll go to sleep and never wake up! Isn't that worth slaving away 50 years to postpone? Sure one time you woke up without going to sleep, but death is really the end. Then karma/God's judgement *might* not torture you in hell, if you obeyed authority and opposed the devil.

Hell is a place of work, fear, and pain; better stick with society for safety. We all say hello to friends and oh hell during conflict (clearly our culture is an expert in teaching us how to avoid evil cults) so we never forget to fear hell and the deceptive devil. He'll trick you with worldly pleasures, obviously freedom is a spiritual right, so our free(ish) market is direct evidence we worship God.

"e3hcpwk","It’s a complex issue. I don’t know that there are one or two big solutions. 

But, we need to make it less comfortable to be here if you don’t play by the simple rules of a civilized society. How do we do that? Tough question. If you ticket these people, they laugh. Night in jail? Bring it on. 

All I can think of is that we force these people to work if they can’t play nice. It’s the last thing they want to do. Make them wear orange vests and pick up trash, scrub benches, paint curbs. At night you get a bunk and you get three sack lunches a day. During the day you put in 8 hours of labor. You don’t want to do that? Move along. 

Much of the solutions are NIMBY-esque, but if every city in the state upped their resources game for people who can follow the rules but played hardball with people who like to create trouble maybe they’d finally be motivated to accept help. Right now we’ve made Eugene a sanctuary city for shitbags. So Springfield plays tough, they just pick up and move to Eugene.

Give people who accept help a real plan for change. This is going to be expensive, but it would save us in the long run. 

But we need to set a limit no matter what. You can’t spread out your digs at broadway and Willamette and camp. You can’t set up camp on the bike path at oakpatch and 11th and leave all your trash.

"e3awr1y","&gt; Why does ""nature"" or whatever wants us to survive ?

the way life arose out of the universe has dictated that it be a struggle for survival. For one creature to live, another must die, it's kind of inevitable. Where cooperation can happen, whole species thrive, but with all cooperation, one must be 'lower' than the other.

From the mitochondria in our cells that have been entirely subsumed into our bodies, to the dogs, horses, pigs, goats, chickens and everything that we tamed, that's life.

&gt; And for what purpose ?

There is no purpose.

&gt; And why women choose sometimes weak pretty boys over strong ugly men ? 

careful, your puberty and sexual frustration is showing.

When younger, women choose strong, bad-boy types because virility and chance could lead to survival of strong, bad-boy type babies.

When older, women choose softer, more compassionate men because they're more likely to stick around and take care of the woman and the babies, leading to the survival of more compassionate, but healthy and able to compete type babies.

&gt; Do weak pretty boys have more chances of survival ?

yes and no. If we're going to get into comparative anatomy and sexuality, there are plenty of examples were weaker, pretty-boy types 'put out' for the stronger males because it makes the stronger males happy, but also get busy with the females because that makes babies.

Are humans like that? Good question.

&gt; Also if we want strong men with strong jawlines and cheekbones to survive, then why are we intelligent ?

evolution does not occur with individuals, but with populations.

&gt; How and why we even bothered to develop something like intelligence when we already know it's pretty much useless in dating ?

because *dating* isn't *evolution*. Dating is the peacock showing off for the hen. If you can't make yourself a big strong dude, make yourself a well-off dude.

I'm trying to understand it, but sometimes it's frustrating.  I like to think of myself as supportive and compassionate, but I dont think she sees it that way so she never opens up to me.


Her previous husband cheated on her and he got another woman pregnant.  He used to beat her and was a raging alcoholic.  I dont think she would embellish this and I never dug into it.  I respect her boundaries 100%.  She has trust issues and unfortunately I'm being held accountable for something someone else did to her.  This is the main reason why we dont communicate face to face I feel like.  Shes a very private person who refuses to seek help.  

I hate to say it, but I'll never find out the true reason why.

For instance, this post keeps saying shes depressed.  She made a comment about Victoria secret and shopping, just now..maybe shes reading?  I jokingly said ""you miss your shopping therapy?  If we cant afford to shop we can always go to the veterans assistance to seek help for depression...its free.""  And it was a stern no.  ""Do you think your depressed?""

"e2ud5qd","We are to follow Jesus’ examples. And he left many to follow.

He was able to ask for forgiveness to those who horribly tortured and executed him. They didn’t ask for forgiveness at the time, but that is all He felt for them all the more. Love, mercy, and forgiveness. 

At the same time, when someone was knowingly sinning, he typically exhibited compassionate, but firm rebuke. Take for instance the Samaritan woman at the well...

John 4:16-18 - *Jesus said to her, “Go, call your husband, and come here.” The woman answered him, “I have no husband.” Jesus said to her, “You are right in saying, ‘I have no husband’; for you have had five husbands, and the one you now have is not your husband. What you have said is true.”* 

He very casually reveals her sin to her here, also as a form of rebuke. But He shows no malice towards her, but patience. He obviously does not approve of her sinful life, but shows great compassion and caring for her nevertheless. He clearly shows His disapproval of her sin, but not personal condemnation. 

She is to Him like a child who has lost their way. He seeks to show her the way back - not through excusing sin as non-consequential or unimportant, rather the opposite -  but through showing her compassion.

That to me, as well as other examples such as the adulterous woman of John 8 (which may or may not be genuine. Regardless, it is a good biblical example of how to love the sinner while hating the sin) which show compassion for others while being uncompromising in dealing with sin.

On the other hand, for those who steadfastly refused Jesus’ advice on sin (not just the Pharisees), Jesus showed godly sorrow towards them, but again did not compromise concerning sin. 

The few times Jesus showed righteous anger was when dealing with those who knew better, but chose nevertheless to follow their own self-righteousness and embrace their own hardened hearts and humanistic standards, even when claiming to follow God. They followed their own man-made system, and were angered by Him when He threatened their power.

But even those Pharisees who genuinely had concerns, He showed them patience. For example, Nicodemus, who possibly became a follower of Jesus around or after the time He helped to give Jesus a respectful burial. An action that likely brought him much scorn.

This is the example we should follow. Certainly not hatred. Compassion, godly sorrow, uncompromising conviction, and hopefully joy if that person is receptive to Gods Word. 

But never hatred or grudge-filled animosity. If that is something you feel at all, then you need to go to God to help you deal with it before worrying about others sinful actions.",1532284339,"at the same time, when someone was knowingly sinning, he typically exhibited compassionate, but firm rebuke.","compassionate, but firm","compassionate","but",TRUE,"compassionate , but firm","firm",NA,NA,1

You are an amazing, amazing friend. You could have saved her life. Even though it wasn't necrosed, only a doctor can tell you for sure, and it still could have gotten seriously infected (death, amputation) eventually if you hadn't acted.

You are a reasonable and compassionate person. To me, those are the two highest virtues a person can have. Whats especially amazing is, you probably aren't an adult yet. Stay true to yourself and you'll be a spectacular woman.

Now, you are about to confront two parents who are not reasonable or compassionate (but THINK they are.) I think it's very unlikely they will say, ""Oh, I see your logic. Everything's fine!

She knows what sort of punishments she's gotten in the past, and should expect that. Just support and console her while she pays the price. 

If you feel like it, you might want to post your story on atheist and Christian subreddits and see if they have any advice: both for her in dealing with her family, and for you to grapple with what has happened. You'll find people who grew up like she did, and people who understand the arguments against this sort of fundamentalism. Some will be Christians who love God and Jesus, but believe in medical care! Maybe they can give you a better solution than I did.

I think that the best thing for her is to join communities like this herself... but only when she's ready. As much as I'd love to tell you to hit her and her family with all the reasons to stop following these crazy beliefs, the fact is that it will hurt her to try to force her to throw away her religion too soon.

* I think Maci is a GREAT mom and I think about the scene where she's lightly ribbing Bentley for being afraid to poop at school entirely too much. Every time I'm out in public and don't want to poop, I'm like, wait, Maci wouldn't want this life for me!!

* I ironically (?) love Farrah and even though I could never choose the life she lives or even think about how she's raising Sophia without getting sad, I have to say I'm obsessed with her as a reality TV personality. Get it bitch. If I were guaranteed the chance I'd buy one of her pocket pussies just to have her sign it, and then frame it above my mantlepiece.

* I hate Kail's attitude and choices. I hate them. But with the parents she's got I cannot *believe* how well she's done with herself going to school and treating her boys with loving and compassionate (but not always smart) parenting. If I had been her during her 16&amp;P or early TM2 seasons I would've just sat in a corner and cried. Wowza, props. Now just learn how to use birth control and take several seats.

* I miss hatewatching Matt.

* I still can't forgive Leah for cheating on Corey. The night before their wedding???????

* Despite my ever-increasingly lowering opinion of Cate and Ty I don't want them to ever break up. They're like the two kids in kindergarten who hold hands all the time and trade valentines and are so in love it's awesome!! I'm embarrassed to say if they ever broke up my worldview of love would be ever so slightly shattered. Yeah I shed a tear watching their wedding, fight me!

* Jenelle and her eyebrows have had such a miraculous glow up, it gives me hope.

* Javi and Lauren are a MESS and a HALF but I'm weirdly optimistic that they've found just what they wanted in each other, despite knowing next to nothing about Lauren. Seems way more into the doting wife role than Kail or Briana ever did.

* I don't really like Chelsea's personality or her segments, but I'm happy for the way life turned out for her and I commend her for not dating and instantly spawning with several dudes before finding her Coley. Girl was single for years while all her cast mates whipped through 'em.

* I love Y&amp;P! I'd been getting a little worried about the whole TM franchise for quite awhile now with all the cast swapping/firing and all the girls basically 1) not being teens anymore 2) being stubborn as hell with their demands from MTV and unwillingness to record juicy moments and mostly importantly 3) now depicting a totally distorted picture of young (often single) motherhood with all the MTV pay checks they've been collecting for years, BUT. I surprised myself by loving every episode of Y&amp;P, the drama is fresh, and I ""like"" (or uh, at least like watching) all the Y&amp;P girls. I hope the shows continues for many more seasons, I think it was a very smart move by MTV!

* Teen Mom as a franchise is unethical as fuck and I highly suspect many of the kids will come forward when they're older to speak out about their lives and often abuse being filmed essentially without their consent and I hope some new child privacy and protection laws come out of it in the end.

And she did, to be fair, but the pressure and stress was still on a bit of a different scale. And I think she also started to feel some of the pressure that comes with more limited free time. So the act of her driving to me weighed on her even more than normal. When something is wrong she tends to hyper focus on that until she feels better, and she struggles to contextualize when in that moment.

"e27z2ww","Interesting narratives that use the Star Wars galaxy to explore themes that could be relevant to our world.

For example, I'd love for there to be a storyline of a planet or galactic faction that opposes Force Users in all forms, believing The Force is the root of all the galaxy's evils and must be contained. Hell you could go even further and have ""Force Hunters"" , those who are trained to hunt down and kill force sensitives.

I'd also like a story perhaps about the rights of droids? Maybe a planet of runaway droids who try to live in peace away from the rest of the galaxy due to them wishing to escape their exploitation and slavery.

I'd also like a storyline that's far more critical of the events and characters in the Original Trilogy. It always struck me as odd that Luke Skywalker just blew up the Death Star, containing around a million people according to canon I believe, and everybody seemed to be fine with that? No family members seeking revenge for the death of their loved ones? 

For the above, I think a very interesting storyline they can do if they do a prequel about the rise of The First Order, is to throw doubt on the rebellion. Maybe say that Luke is a war criminal? Deny that the Death Star ever blew up Alderaan and that it's just ""Rebel Propaganda"" that it happened? Maybe Luke Skywalker encounters the families of the victims aboard the Death Star during some sort of kangaroo court trial and it dawns on him the weight his actions have had.

I've never been a fan of the ""Luke Skywalker is a wise master who knows what's best for everybody."" Archetype. We already have that in Yoda, Obi-Wan, etc,.

The letters were a match to a powderkeg of civic unrest. 


But as to why they can't do more? Well I believe that they're building to a Canadian invasion. And Gilead didn't have a million true believers so much as they took advantage of timing and then disorganization in the wake of their terrorist attack. So I think that the 'more' is coming.

The issue is that God bears no responsibility for a world that ""He"" never made to begin with.* God's compassion is not directed toward altering the world's material processes via miraculous intervention - for the simple but crucial reason that God never had anything to do with cosmic origins in the first place. That kind of intervening, meddling response is simply not in God's job description.

Moreover, I believe that God does not in any case have the power to intervene, even if such a duty were to fall under the umbrella of his moral obligations. Associated with this arbitrary notion - that for God to be real, God **must** be a creator - is the equally random notion that God to be real - for God to **be** God - God must also be an all-powerful interventionist.

From my own viewpoint, the major problem with that conception is that it ascribes gross material attributes to God - ""power"" in this sense implying ""Energy"" and ""the ability to get jobs done"", i.e., to create worlds and to perform miracles - with its implied, concomitant requirement to acquire and expend fuel toward the end of ""performing work"".

And of course, the secondary problem with the interventionist God is the massive incongruity of all God's interventions, with their inexplicably random distribution. And the final problem is that of all of God's **non**\-interventions.

These traits and expectations are, not unexpectedly, projected onto an all-**powerful** creator. But they do not apply to a non-creating deity, because God, as a non-material, self-sufficing Spirit, has no physical power and performs no physical activity. God's only ""power"" and ""activity"", in my view, is ""His"" ability to spiritually transform sentient beings through their experience of communion and union with God.

This view perhaps finds partial expression in Jesus's words about ""the fall of the sparrow"", which is not prevented by God, but nonetheless takes place before, and unfolds within, the Divine Awareness. So I believe that regardless of whatever physical calamity might befall us, God's infinite compassion will ultimately, in the end, ransom and ""make good"" our perceived losses. Obviously, that's a faith-statement, but for me it more or less effortlessly finds its place in my construct of a compassionate but non-creating, non-intervening God.

This is by no means a maverick view. There are several systems which describe a non-creating, non-intervening Sacred Transcendent, among them Confucianism, Taoism, Buddhism (Nirvana is congruent with certain Western conceptions about the Godhead), Advaita, as well as the long history of mystics, Eastern and Western. Not to mention the Christian Gnostics, many of whom claimed that the world was made by an inept, false deity, whom they mockingly called ""the Demiurge"", and who said that the True God did not create the world and resides in the perfect realm of the Pleroma , from which ""He"" compassionately directs grace to beings who are caught in the lower realm of suffering.",1530482450,"obviously, that's a faith-statement, but for me it more or less effortlessly finds its place in my construct of a compassionate but non-creating, non-intervening god.","compassionate but non","compassionate","but",FALSE,"compassionate but non","non",NA,NA,1
"e1lazok","Your sister is exhibiting peculiar behavior. It sounds like she’s lonely. You’re her coping mechanism.




It could also be that she suffers from some extreme paranoia. Something becomes a mental illness when it affects ones ability to maintain a normal life, causes severe distress, or strains healthy relationships. If her anxiety for your wellbeing is as sincere and intense as she claims it is, then she may be suffering from some anxiety disorder. I doubt this is the case because of her persistence to have small talk instead of a quick check in, but I think it is important to include for due diligence.






Her motivation for calling you can provide direction for how you should approach it.




If it is loneliness, I think being compassionate, but also firm about your needs for space should be appropriate. Make it clear that you understand her perspective. No one will be satisfied with a discussion if they feel their argument wasn’t heard. 



If her behavior is rooted in intense anxiety, I doubt this approach would lead to satisfying results. I don’t think I could confidently provide advice on how to handle this scenario.

"e1glv6w","The embarrassment? I can't help you. Your MIL was out of line calling on you. Hopefully someone told her you can't do that as the teachers have no idea who is able to participate and who is not. Go talk to your bishop and tell him what happened. He needs to know so that he can instruct his teachers never to do that again. He may ask you not to go to your MIL's classes, or even give you an assignment to attend another class -- perhaps in a way that will not arouse suspicion in your MIL. There should be no embarrassment in this process. I wish people were more mature and compassionate, but we're all sinners in one way or the other, and some of us sin differently than I do.

I think, for yourself, you need to imagine that almost everyone in that class who is there, fully able to participate, probably went through some form of discipline at one time or another. You'll never know. We'll never tell you. Heck, the bishop might not even know who did what when. I come from a ward where the old men aren't shy talking about how they were different people in their youth, some would smoke behind the woodshed, others did life a little differently than what the gospel recommended. All have found forgiveness!

You need to imagine that the person sitting next to you is in the same boat as you, but you're both too afraid to tell each other. Or they were in the boat, but now they aren't, so they know what you're experiencing now.

What's worse are those who should be experiencing discipline, but aren't, because they are too afraid to tell God and the bishop. I feel sorry for those people, because there, right in front of them, is the most marvelous fruit ready to pluck, juicy and sweet and perfectly ripe, but they refuse to touch it let alone eat. You who have submitted humbly to the Lord and the bishop, you can see the fruit, you can smell it, you can touch it, and soon you will be able to eat to your heart's desire.

Most importantly, I want to tell you a personal experience when I sat on a high council and we had disciplinary councils. Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ love you more than you know, even though you may have committed a grave sin. To be honest, their love for you seems to intensify when you sin, I think. What a marvelous opportunity you have to come closer to the Savior, closer than you ever have been! This is my testimony. ""Whom the Lord loves, he chastises."" You are chastised *because* the Lord is counting on you to be better, to be greater, and he believes you will be.

So imagine you're sitting in a class full of sinners and people under discipline. Imagine that Christ himself is sitting in the back row, smiling, not because you all are righteous, but because you all showed up anyway. That is a huge accomplishment, a sure sign of faith in Christ if ever there were any!

"e1edn2k","TLDR: it depends on the hospital and how you are doing. AMA you want. 

It seriously depends on a lot of factors like the hospital and how you are doing at the time. I've been in voluntarily and involuntarily, in 3 different hospitals (4 stays). 

My first experience in a psych ward was horrible. I was young and illprepared for that experience. It was also by far the worst hospital I have had to stay at, my psychiatrist was a power-hungry asshole who paid very little attention to his patients, etc. The nurses were way over worked and totally burnt out. The more dangerous patients were not well supervised so a lot of fights broke out. There was no privacy. It was a traumatic experience to say the least. 

My second was better albeit harder. I have developped severe anxiety disorders in the years since my first hospitalization and at the time of my second hospitalization I was terrified of being around people. Thankfully that hospital was very accomodating, they moved me to a private room and let my husband stay with me in hospital. It was hard but the hospital staff (doctors, nurses, OTs, etc.) were much calmer and kinder than at the other hospital. 

My third was just a month after the 2nd and at the same hospital. Very similar experience except I was also going through withdrawal so that was brutal in addition to everything else. 

My fourth was at a third hospital. This time was much briefer (under a week whereas all the others were about two and a half week long). This hospital wasn't as nice as the previous one but way better than the first. Doctors and nurses were kind and compassionate but the hospital wing itself was older and had more issues. They wouldn't let my husband stay with me that time which was a huge challenge but I understood because I wasn't in a private room and it would have been uncomfortable for my roommate, also they wanted me to try to cope on my own. This was my first time being in involuntarily which added a lot of anxiety because I felt trapped. 

Hospitalizations are good if you need them and if it's a good hospital. In my last three hospital stays I benefited a lot from the occupational therapy sessions. It all depends on the circumstances. 

I'm doing okay I guess. Not in the hospital right now and hope I won't have to be ever again. But realistically, I'll be back again. I'm still in constant therapy and I haven't seen much improvement.

Otherwise compassion can also mean something like kindness or empathy or sympathy as well.  In an esoteric context, the purest form of compassion is unsentimental.

Here's how [Vimalakirti Nirdesa Sutra](http://www2.kenyon.edu/Depts/Religion/Fac/Adler/Reln260/Vimalakirti.htm) explains it:

&gt;&gt; ""The sick bodhisattva should tell himself: 'Just as my sickness is unreal and nonexistent, so the sicknesses of all living beings are unreal and nonexistent.' Through such considerations, he arouses the great compassion toward all living beings without falling into any sentimental compassion. The great compassion that strives to eliminate the accidental passions does not conceive of any life in living beings. Why? Because great compassion that falls into sentimentally purposive views only exhausts the bodhisattva in his reincarnations. But the great compassion which is free of involvement with sentimentally purposive views does not exhaust the bodhisattva in all his reincarnations. He does not reincarnate through involvement with such views but reincarnates with his mind free of involvement. Hence, even his reincarnation is like a liberation. Being reincarnated as if being liberated, he has the power and ability to teach the Dharma which liberates living beings from their bondage. As the Lord declares: 'It is not possible for one who is himself bound to deliver others from their bondage. But one who is himself liberated is able to liberate others from their bondage.' Therefore, the bodhisattva should participate in liberation and should not participate in bondage.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; ""What is bondage? And what is liberation? To indulge in liberation from the world without employing liberative technique is bondage for the bodhisattva. To engage in life in the world with full employment of liberative technique is liberation for the bodhisattva. To experience the taste of contemplation, meditation, and concentration without skill in liberative technique is bondage. To experience the taste of contemplation and meditation with skill in liberative technique is liberation. Wisdom not integrated with liberative technique is bondage, but wisdom integrated with liberative technique is liberation. Liberative technique not integrated with wisdom is bondage, but liberative technique integrated with wisdom is liberation.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; ""How is wisdom not integrated with liberative technique a bondage? Wisdom not integrated with liberative technique consists of concentration on voidness, signlessness, and wishlessness, and yet, being motivated by sentimental compassion, failure to concentrate on cultivation of the auspicious signs and marks, on the adornment of the buddha-field, and on the work of development of living beings it is bondage.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; ""How is wisdom integrated with liberative technique a liberation? Wisdom integrated with liberative technique consists of being motivated by the great compassion and thus of concentration on cultivation of the auspicious signs and marks, on the adornment of the buddha-field, and on the work of development of living beings, all the while concentrating on deep investigation of voidness, signlessness, and wishlessness - and it is liberation. 

This might throw someone for a loop, because how can one be compassionate but also unsentimental?  That's because if one is overly involved in worldly passions one falls to suffering.

One thing that I don't think the Sutra makes explicit is the perspectival nature of suffering.  So curing suffering has to be perspectival as well.  For you, the most important perspective has to be your own.  It's thanks to your own perspective that the perspectives of others have the potential to make any sense.  So for you your own perspective can be considered a root perspective.  Therefore eliminating suffering must start there, at the root.  In simple terms, you have to first and foremost eliminate your own suffering.  In a sense, this is selfish.  What does it mean to eliminate your own suffering?  Is it just eliminating the suffering in a small radius around your body?  I would say no, and thinking that ""your own"" is just your body and a small area around it is too narrow.  Another way to make the circle of compassion too narrow is to be very intolerant toward even slightly different ways of doing things.  So for example, if someone leaves the lid on a toilet down and you like it up, or vice versa, and you keep grilling the other person to become perfect about the toilet lid, that's too intolerant, too narrow.  On the other hand, if you don't complain even when the other person is say mutilating the bodies of others (for example, using the excuse of a religious practice they mutilate the bodies of minors who cannot defend themselves), then you're *too* tolerant.  Then your tolerance allows misery to proliferate.  Being too tolerant is like being indifferent to misery, which is not the same as wanting to end misery.  As for the actual boundary, between too narrow and too wide, everyone has to figure this out for themselves.  This requires living and breathing wisdom and not just a set of dogmatic rules.

So being too narrow in one's self-compassion would mean to correctly take your own perspective as the root, but then to keep your perspective really claustrophobic and tiny as opposed to making it expansive.  But making it too expansive could also mean something like being nosy and a kind of restless busybody that pokes one's nose all over the place without any rest, like a nanny.  An example of a very narrow circle of self-compassion is hoarding wealth without sharing it and without supporting social programs at the level of government.  But if you only live to serve and never please yourself, that's another kind of perversion, where the person doesn't honor their own perspective as the root.

So it's pretty tricky to balance everything.

Ultimately I would say your balance is just right if you can produce not just a beautiful life, but a beautiful world for yourself.  When you enjoy seeing smiles on your neighbor's faces, that's a good thing.  But if in order to see a smile on someone else's face you're willing to destroy your own, that's not good.  Then you become subject to hostage-taking situations.  If you start with yourself first and then radiate goodness outward in a broad circle but without being a busybody and without being subject to any kind of hostage-taking scenario (ie, you cannot be manipulated and your compassion cannot be used against you by a manipulative person or system), then your disposition is perfect, I would say.",1529634047,"this might throw someone for a loop, because how can one be compassionate but also unsentimental?","compassionate but also","compassionate","but",FALSE,"compassionate but also unsentimental","unsentimental",NA,"also",1

""You know what would make me happier than you getting that promotion at work? breaking up with your partner""

&gt;Having patience and empathy is actually more likely to help them accept you in the long run, if that is something you want.

I have been - I donated at least $300 to them when I was homeless back in high school, and I still got my high school diploma. I have been empathetic and compassionate but I'm sick and tired of them using their biases against me as justifications to try and ruin the relationship. I lived with people that had their point of view for ***years*** which caused me to be in the situation I'm in now where I haven't been able to work on my mental issues until now, because everyone I know of thinks and acts like they do and look down on you if you don't bring in lots of money.

&gt;So we can control model how you would like them to treat you, that's the best way to get that kind of treatment back. It might not work, but at least it's the high road.

To be frank... I'm done taking the high road with everyone I know because I have tried and tried apologizing for things that weren't my fault, trying to make amends where THEY broke the relationship, being nice when all they've done is make me miserable. I'm through putting up with the shit plain and simple.

The advice you gave is helpful for a normal, general circumstance but doesn't help here specifically. Though I appreciate you taking the time to reply - I have been trying ""to see from their perspective"" for years now. Their religion states that they shouldn't treat someone like this and yet they do. People have told them to stop and yet they don't. My partner has told them that they are happy with me and they still push. I try to help them in other ways aside from money and it doesn't help.

Doing things for the betterment of their perspective doesn't work because they are damaged people projecting their damage onto people they have no control over. Family doesn't mean ownership. The only reason they haven't done anything extreme is because it's illegal for them to do so and we have our own place. I'm sure they would have packed up and left just to separate the two of us. Their dad has said things like ""I'm gonna take them out to the desert to bury them"".

"e0yi5fo","I read a lot of fantasy and a prevalent issue I see in ""strong female characters"" is that they think it means female characters who are *strong* rather than strong characters who are *female*. Being physically strong doesn't make you a strong character, and in most cases they make these women strong in masculine ways (as you highlighted) while disparaging any and all feminine traits as weak. Also, these girls are *always* described as sexy bomb shells yet are never allowed a boyfriend outside of the hero.

There's a place for masculine and physically strong female characters. There's also a place for women who are particularly feminine and still kickass. There is place for women who don't literally kick ass but are in powerful positions (Holdo, Leia). There is a place for women who are very much girly girls and aren't shamed for it and can still be heroes and main characters.

But these characters are time and time again shamed for showing any form of femininity or not being badass enough or being too badass in a way that isn't ""approved"" and it pisses me off.

My neice absolutely *loves* Frozen and idolises Elsa. And why shouldn't she? Elsa is a huge power fantasy for young girls and that's great. She has cool ice powers and can build all sorts of wonderful things. She also wears a gorgeous dress and can act goofy at times. She is caring and compassionate, but also insecure and unsure of her powers. She is a protective big sister who isn't afraid to tell of Anna when she wants tp get married at first sight. She messes up, but she still tries and acts heroically to save her sister. I'm glad my niece looks up to her. Yet people have all sorts of outrage against Frozen and say that the characters are stupid. These people also happen ttp be in their 20's/30's and are male and not at all yhe target audience or the right people to tell an 8 year old girl who to idolise. Who the fuck are you random internet person to say who my neice should idolise or relate to?

We need more female characters like that to show girls *and* boys that strength has many forms. Not everyone has to be how these guys think or want their female characters to be, because then we end up with Marvel where every female character fights and talks the exact same way with the exception of Wanda, power-wise.

I have a *lot* of things to say about women in Marvel and particularly Infinity War... but suffice it to say that if you have to take 20 movies and 11 years before you make a solo female led movie... you've got some issues. Also I hate that theey always have to fight with the contrived sexy skin suits and poses. Just *argh!*

But I digress...

What you said about the female leads still being an object of affection rather than the subject is something that is really frustrating Particularly how all of these ""strong female characters"" are always super beautiful and sexualised but also have to save themselves for the main hero or male audience surrogate.

I got a friend to start reading *The Stormlight Archive* by Brandon Sanderson and he casually referred to Shallan as a slut. I had a spit take because this girl is 18, doesn't sleep with anyone, and develops feelings for a character in Book 1 but it isn't mutual, then is betrothed to another character in Book 2 while another separate character starts to show interest in her. Also her betrothed literally jumps from one girl to another all throughout Book 1. Yet *she's* the slut...

Rey is no different. How dare she start developing feelings for Kylo when he is a monster? Never mind that throughout her entire journey she has been learning about his history, his motivation and who he is beneath the mask and as an actual person. Seriously, rewatch TFA and TLJ back to back, every scene that reveals something about Kylo involves Rey or has Rey being the one learning about him (exception being Han and Leia's private convo). Her learning about love, discovering sexuality and emphasising with people is textbook hero's journey and human maturity. But I digress, you've already explored that excellently :)

It's cool that we have characters like Ripley. It's cool that we have characters like Elsa. It's cool that we have characters like Rey. Strength comes in many forms, and characters present strength in different ways. It also isn't all of who a character is, it is only a part. Rey is a good fighter and strong with the force. She also has a likes tinkering with ships and droids, can be girly and is allowed to have romance and silly moments too. That's fantsstic and shouldn't be discouraged.

I don't know how Ballas expects to regain Margulis' trust and love after all he has done, or how he intends to avoid being backstabbed by Hunhow the second Natah is back in his hands, but that kind of confidence seems appropriate for Dipshit McLongArm.

So our goal would be in two parts: First, go rescue Margulis from Ballas, and actually have a proper boss battle with the motherfucker, take his sword, and toss him into the sun.

Sadly, my experience is that this mindset is rampant among older women as well.

I was telling several of my aunts (all heterosexual) about how amazing this woman was: how she was witty, smart, driven, easy to have conversations with, and genuinely kind and compassionate. But these details didn't seem to matter to my aunts. They were more interested in how pretty she was.

This made me so sad, angry and quite frankly surprised. Didn't my aunts realize that a woman's worth isn't just a matter of her physical attributes? Didn't my aunts want their fellow women to be treated like full people?

Apparently not. It turns out that my crush *was* pretty, but not as objectively pretty as some of her peers. But that's not what attracted me to her. It was the whole package (person). And I didn't feel *right* reducing this girl to her physical attributes.

The crux of your argument is this idea that fascists were compassionate because they said they were and because they sometimes acted that way towards one another. Because history is complicated and full of different actors doing different things we can comfortably say that this must have been true some of the time, but it wasn't true all of the time, as you keep referencing with this idea of ""overall"" fascists. This is true, obviously. You seem to think my position is that every single fascist felt no compassion because they were fascists. Thats false, obviously, thats not even false its ridiculous. I even said this way back at the beginning:

&gt;No one seriously believes that even a self identified fascist wakes up one morning and says, ""hm yesterday I was a monarchist and today I am a fascist it seems all my compassion has left me."" That is ridiculous. 

Is this what you believe my position is? 

The problem with your approach is that this tells us nothing. It is as if I asked you what the weather was outside today and you responded with: ""It is sometimes sunny, but sometimes it rains and sometimes it even snows."" Well that statement is obviously true, its also a fucking stupid answer to the question. It does not help us prepare or teach us about the weather, it is a non position, you cannot debate it, it is simply an acknowledgement that the weather has many possible states. 

For instance this point:

&gt;Overridden means it played no role in his decision to kill this particular German. It doesn't mean he don't feel compassion towards some other German. 

Here You're appealing to the idea that this person ""might have been compassionate to some other people even as he killed other ones he was not compassionate too and this therefore means he was compassionate at least some of the time."" Yes I am aware human beings are complex and can have different feelings towards different things. This is not a point about anything though unless the point is that humans are complex, which is not being debated. 

My position is that Fascism an the actions of fascists were not compassionate, towards themselves, their ""fellow men"" or anyone else. We know this because of their behavior, characterized by brutality, violence and a disturbing  lack of empathy.

Your position seems to be, ""overall fascists were not compassionate, but fascism was was motivated in part by nationalism which is characterized by feelings of compassion. This means some fascists were compassionate towards one another some of the time. When fascists acted in an uncompassionate way, it was because they were not compassionate then, but they were at other times so saying fascists were not compassionate is technically untrue.""

I mean, I guess? A position so full of qualifiers and relative perspectives it is effectively useless and more important for you, impossible to debate. It is not a position because it allows for both possibilities to be true at the same time. Schrodingers Fascist, who is both compassionate and uncompassionate but we wont know until we check. Do you apply this strict relative appraisal to your whole position? Obviously not, as some fascists weren't nationalists, the Nazis stretched their definition of nationalism to basically just be ""Aryan"" and they allowed non\-Germans (even non\-Aryan non\-Germans) to join the group. 

Please please go read about fascism, its obvious you have no idea what was or what fascists did. You assert the false claim that fascists loved their country, even as the empirical proof, that they destroyed it, is self evident. Did you know, for instance that Hitler in part wanted the Reich buildings designed to look good as ruins? Speer told us this. The death and destruction, even of themselves, was part of the philosophy from the very beginning.

If you want to continue to advance the relative position ""some fascists felt compassionate some of the time."" Feel free, it is a non\-argument. And it flies in the face of historical truth, that fascism as an ideology, and fascists actions, regardless of the attitudes of individuals, were characterized by the opposite opposite of compassion, brutality and dehumanization which crushed any compassion they may have felt. Otherwise you may advance the opposite point, that fascists were compassionate, even if only towards themselves, something you believe is self\-evident because your only experience with fascism is from their own propaganda.

"e0dzkri","No.   Self or ego do not have to be killed.   Self and ego are ideas.  They are thoughts.  They come and go all the time on their own.   One minute we have a thought that we are a great meditator who has achieved ego death.  The next minute we have a thought that we are a failure.  The next moment we have a thought that we are hungry and would like a tuna sandwich.

The approach that Buddhism suggests is two fold.  First, Buddhism suggests that positive behaviors are helpful (generosity, patience, concern for others) and negative behaviors (greed, lying, killing, selfishness) should be avoided.  This is normal housekeeping to leading a decent and happy life that is somewhat helpful to others.

Second, Buddhism teaches to look into the nature of mind — as it is.  Meditation practice is an important approach for doing this.   The idea is not to achieve an altered state of mind like “ego death” — but to see our minds as they are.  Buddhism teaches that our minds as they are are clear and compassionate.  But it often takes time and a willingness to look to see that.

"dzsvi32","I have used a midwife practice for all of my pregnancies as well— live birth, stillbirth, and current pregnancy. For my first child we were living in a different state so I was seeing a different practice but they are remarkably similar, though your experience may differ, based solely on the style of practice.

Both of my practices have housed a group of midwives, and I have gotten rotating care with whoever is available when I’m due for my appointment. This is beneficial because when you deliver, you end up with whoever is on call that day, so it’s good to have seen everyone beforehand just so no one is a stranger. Both of my practices have operated within a hospital setting, and both have had a birth center IN the hospital for low risk, low intervention births.

My first baby was breech, and at 37 weeks they determined I had low fluid and I needed a c-section immediately. Midwives can’t perform the surgery, but they were overseen by doctors affiliated with the hospital. My first hospital happened to be a teaching hospital so my csection was performed by a giant team of residents, but the midwives on call were also very involved in my hospital stay— one checked on me during every shift because I was their patient, even though they hadn’t delivered my baby. 

My second baby was stillborn. We didn’t learn this until we got to the hospital after I was in labor. (The midwives will not perform inductions for people with precious c-sections; labor must occur spontaneously for a VBAC, and I was not a candidate for the birth center having had a VBAC.) In the hospital setting I was able to have an epidural and my midwife delivered my baby. I was fortunate to deliver at a hospital with a robust perinatal loss team, so my nursing staff was wonderful and compassionate, but my midwife and I really bonded that day. She was an incredibly loving part of an awful experience and her care of me made me sure that she was the one I wanted to see me through my next pregnancy if at all possible.

She is the midwife I have seen for all but two of my appointments this pregnancy— the entire practice has been wonderful and caring and sensitive to my particular needs and anxieties, but they also understand that this midwife and I went through something together and have made some allowances for having me see just her whenever possible for my appointments. I am having a scheduled c-section on Friday and she will be present for it— and another midwife from the practice will literally scrub in on the surgery as I guess an assisting nurse, which is apparently the standard for this practice at this hospital. I don’t know who the attending physician will be, but I have been assured that the OB team they work with hand-in-hand at the hospital is all very capable and will be given a heads up on my history so that everyone in the room knows what’s going on.

I am sure that there are OB clinics out there with this level of holistic, personal care, especially for women with anxiety provoking losses in their past. But I am forever devoted to midwives for my own personal pregnancy (and well woman) care, because they have the same medical skills and breadth of knowledge as an OB when it comes to following a pregnancy and delivering a baby with low risk circumstances. (Since there are no actual indications of elevated risk in this pregnancy, my midwife treats me as a low risk case, but refers me to a perinatologist for extra monitoring due to my history.) She has the capability to write prescriptions for me as needed, to refer me to specialists where relevant, and to be the point person managing my care. So my feeling is, if you feel like you really gelled with the midwife you spoke to on the phone today, make an appointment with them.

The interactions between Rex and Pyra are all blushy-crushy anime stereotypes.  That isn't how any real relationship works.

What many people like about Nia and Rex is that, because she isn't the female lead, she actually needed to be a well developed and interesting character on her own right.  She couldn't ride the ""MacGuffin"" train.

Nia mocks Rex at the start but very quickly we get a look at her softer sign with the scene on the Crow's Nest.  She comes off as a token ""Knight in Sour Armor.""  She wants to be an idealist, she wants to believe that the world is a good place and the people in it are kind and compassionate, but her personal experiences have deeply challenged that belief.  She flat out says that she thought people were only out for themselves.

But Rex changes that, and she goes *all in* on that hope from pretty much the first moment we meet her.  She *wants* to believe in his idealistic future, even if she doesn't actually believe in Elysium.  She believes in Rex, she wants to see him be right, to see the world he'll create.

Why is there a homeless population, and why does it seem to concentrate in dense, liberal \(yes, wait a second, its not what you think\), educated, high paying, boom towns more often than not?

It's a difficult situation in cities around he US, but the problem is exacerbated by the historical decrease in City, State and Federal funding of mental health &amp; drug abuse services, shelters, rehabilitation and family aide centres.

You would think that if the problem continues to grow and compounds on itself uncontrollably, that it would rally a call for change and sweeping, meaningful reforms, right?

My world view was fucking DESTROYED when I visited San Francisco. City with far more business presence, tax revenue and progressive policies than our lovely Seattle. Unfortunately, its dramatically worse down there and it seems that, in many cases in cities around the US, **good spirited and well meaning programmes, initiatives and people end up attracting more homeless there.**

So few cities tackle this pragmatically and in coordination with other cities or counties in a regional metro area, if ever. The output of this type of half assed approach is national hot spots where folks who are homeless, by their own will or not, ""migrate"" to cities with friendlier accommodations.

It's a vicious loop. Once you begin, how can you stop? Really, how can you? It WILL cost you votes and your constituency is **liberal leaning, educated, well paid, gentrifying, cultured and empathetic.**

Either we institute a nation wide effort to crush this problem across all verticals and help Americans at the bottom of their lifes story in each city, each state...

Or, we continue to see bursts of temporary interest and legislation in small pockets of high tax revenue, high density, growing, affluent cities. As we have since the 70's and 80's depending on the coast you're talking about.

Double edged sword right? It's a humanitarian issue with so many variables. I feel so bad for anyone who is in that situation without access to the resources they need to overcome their drug addiction or overcome \+ manage their mental illness. What a scary and vulnerable life that must be.

4th Edition Tau codex has one vague reference to it.  Not sure if it was mentioned elsewhere.

No faction in 40K are the 'good guys' although Tau are closest.

Tau society is built around a rigid caste system.  You only need to look to India until very recently to know what a caste system looks like.  People's lives are pre-determined, artificial barriers are erected around their prospects, and discrimination is seen as a holy duty.  Even if you ended up as the top caste (brahmin) you were still doomed to a life of religious asceticism (on paper) as it was your karmic duty to live that life.

Tau are called space communists because they're totalitarian and manage every aspect of their subjects' lives through similar castic socio-religious/legal norms, and they have that 'greater good' thing going for them.

Frankly, strategic or not, management of human breeding and birth is completely compatible with how the Tau operate.  After all, the Gue'vesa are not unintegrated mercs like the Kroot, they're subjects of the Tau empire, like the Vespids are.  They are humans living under Tau rule, and by Tau rules.

At some point in their relationship I think Rose became conscious of the fact that it wasn’t as healthy as she thought it was and that Pearl still saw herself as beneath Rose despite Rose always wanting them to be on equal footing (although maybe she wasn’t, maybe Pearl lied and said she saw things that way but never did)

Whether she knew or not, it’s clear that Pearl and Rose, while they both sincerely and genuinely loved each other, had clashing perspectives on their relationship, their role in their relationship, what they wanted out of it and what they thought the other wanted, which was the cause of a lot of their unhealthy aspects of their dynamic. I don’t think Rose had the necessary emotional tools or the courage to confront that issue though.

I don’t mean this in a negative or bashing way but I think one of Rose’s major character flaws is not knowing how to confront difficult situations and complex issues with no easy answers that require tough conversations 

She prefers to take the easy way out and sweep things under the rug and ignore things and not talk about them rather than risk hurting the people she cares about and potentially losing them by telling them the truth, and I think she’s also afraid of having to confront her own flaws (which she doesn’t think she can change) by getting into those difficult situations

It’s kind of the downside of being a free spirited character. She’s loving and compassionate but she’s also avoidant and wants to be able to pretend everything is fine even when she knows it’s not and doesn’t really understand why everything is not fine or why other people aren’t responding to things the way she expects them to. She kind of just assumes everything is going to work out and doesn’t really think about consequences or plan for failure 

I definitely and without a doubt believe that Rose saw Pearl as an equal and wanted Pearl to see herself as an equal. She was genuine in her desire to set Pearl free. But I think the reality of that and how complex it was and how psychologically dependent Pearl was on Rose and how Pearl’s role in society as worthless and subservient had shaped her and damaged her self image on a fundamental level were things Rose didn’t have the emotional intelligence to understand, at least not at the time she asked these things of her",1526519706,"she’s loving and compassionate but she’s also avoidant and wants to be able to pretend everything is fine even when she knows it’s not and doesn’t really understand why everything is not fine or why other people aren’t responding to things the way she expects them to.","loving and compassionate","compassionate",NA,FALSE,"loving and compassionate","loving",NA,NA,0

"dyvua1t","Ahhh, you’re right, the ascended Arkay tale seems far more Bretonic, especially given their meri heritage.

I’ve thought of Xen as Trinimac’s weaker brother (fitting that the other one is the Strong God.) Xen is probably the deity of agriculture and toil, but was largely rejected by the Altmer as too human a perception of the world: it praises the interaction of entrapped deities with Mundane matter far too easily. The Altmer sort of “split” their perception of this Ada, and wanted they didn’t like became known as Xen. Or, just to be heretical, Trinimac is a threefold conjoining Xen, Stendarr and Xarxes. ;)

And as you mention the Jesus of Nazareth parallels: even some developers from ESO have noted that it might make sense for Arkay to have a Father and Son mythos. It is indeed powerful, and certainly makes Arkay out to be compassionate but also inquisitive, which seems to fit his role: in his stories he seeks to know more, he yearns to increase his wisdom. The Hermaeus Mora parallels are actually startling... maybe Arkay the bookkeeper found the Oghma Infinium, and write the Mysterium Xarxes as his initial thesis just before ascending? ;)

The quote that you give really hints at the idea that Mundus is supposed to recycle souls. Mara compassionately yet sternly — like any admirable mother, I guess — let’s Arkay choose to find that out.

Also, the ending of that love story is bizarre. Fancy explaining it to me? :)

"dytg8sl","While I agree that Michele’s motivations in season 1 and 2 seemed dramatically different, I feel like there is an internal consistently and that she wasn’t ONLY motivated by her brother. If her love for her brother was the only driving force (season 1 revenge for him, season 2 redemption for him), I don’t think she would’ve been so quick to abandon him once she discovered the depth of his commitment to the offshore (at the expense of the Inland). 

I do feel like there is a consistently anti-Offshore leaning to her motivations, or maybe just a general opposition towards individual freedoms and lives being compromised by the goals of those in power, the Offshore being the greatest perpetrator of that. I feel like after everything she went through for the love of her brother, abandoning him after the revelation of his own motives must mean they run contrary to a core component of hers, and thus maybe reveal them to us through opposition.

Since she leaves him after his confession, it seems like her major objection to Andre is his ideologically committment to the Offshore and it’s indifference to/perpetuation of the suffering of those in the Inland. As such, I’m inclined to believe her most basic drive is to fight the injustice enacted by those in power upon those who suffer, and her targets shift as more information becomes available; at first it’s easy to blame the offshore and Ezequiel, then she discovers the Cause also uses and manipulates people, and finally that her brother would see the world suffer before himself. 

Her allegiances aren’t shifting, she’s just becoming disillusioned with the things she’s believed in one by one, until she’s left with only herself and a few close friends. Unfortunately with them taking on the mantle of “the Shell”, my guess is that this trajectory will continue and next season will deal with them falling victim to the same traps of power. 

Once again I think the original Trio/Couples story offers an interesting parallel, especially because in that moment we see how complicated webs of power and moral decisions can be. Both sides of the argument are nuanced and problematic in their own right; Samira is compassionate but perhaps naive, Vitor and Lais are possibly justified but also selfish. While I think the show pushes us to side with Samira, I think it’s worth noting that Vitor and Lais were also fighting against a corrupt and powerful elite class trying to steal what, in their eyes, what rightfully theirs. The others in the city were collateral, yes, but their enemy was, at least embodied by Samira’s a-hole father, the closest thing to a true villain this show has given us so far. Samira, working with perhaps the purer motivations here, is the one who introduces violence to the equation; the staging makes clear that her murder is not a “murder” but an accident while the other two are trying to wrest the gun away from her (while she retrieved the gun and fired with clear intent harm or kill). I don’t think anything is portrayed as morally clearcut here, and I love that this is thematically inherited by the events of the show and Michele’s own journey! 

TLDR; Michele hates corrupt power, might discover that power corrupts. Her motives are consistent, but her world keeps changing.

Other than what's already been said, what was really helpful for me was thinking about how I would feel if someone else said something negative about things I like in whatever category I was judging. If I was about to say something negative about someone's taste in music, I would think about how I would feel if someone said something negative about my own, and how gross it feels to have someone tell you that what you love is not legitimate or as real or good as what they like. 

The other thing that was really helpful as far as repairing relationships and building new ones goes was apologizing when I realized I had said something judgmental. For example, I was commenting to a friend about how silly and weird I find the whole calling male sexual partners ""daddy"" thing. My friend immediately said, in a compassionate but firm tone, ""no kink shaming."" That made me think about how shame is such a terrible and unfortunately common occurrence when it comes to people's sexuality, and it would be shitty for me to add to that shame. I thought about how I would feel if someone told me that my kinks were gross or not normal. This is the important part: I then apologized to my friend, and admitted I was wrong to say what I said. I've found that people gain so much respect for you when you can apologize for mistakes and admit that you're wrong. So, if you slip up and say something judgmental, know it's okay, and try not to judge yourself for it (as that's not going to help anyone), but do what you can to make it right when you realize that you've said something judgmental.

The resolution will come, one way or another, but there are no guarantees that he will come around. But if you give in to his insistence that he can’t take the time to please you, then he maintains the upper hand so to speak and you will have to settle for what he’s willing to put out. If you’re willing to maintain the kind of relationship you have now because you feel it is better than losing him then by all means, keep doing what you’re doing. 

There is no quick fix for this. They key to changing your relationship is to maintain calm confidence through out your conversations about this. You are setting a boundary, not making a threat or ultimatum— so you have to be kind and calm, and stay grounded.  Hold onto your convictions. Remind yourself that his emotions are his and not a reflection of you. If he gets angry, that does not mean you did anything wrong. His anger and blame does not have to be your shame or anxiety. If you let him have his emotions, they will pass on their own as long as you stay calm and compassionate, but you also have to be assertive. Setting that boundary is easier said than done.

Foreplay is in the eye of the beholder. It can be touching, stroking, kissing, anything that you like. It can be in different errogenous sones- like for me, the small of my back and inner thighs are where it’s at. 

In my opinion, “enough” foreplay is when both parties feel satisfied. For me, that is when I feel like I am about to cum. That’s when I want him inside of me and that’s when I beg him to fuck me. Sometimes it takes 40 min or so (before intercourse) because we stop and start again. We may need to readjust, grab more lube, stop to make out, stop to talk about things that pop up or that we can’t get off our minds, stop for a back rub, or sometimes I may even push my dude away so I can masterbate a little because his hands just aren’t doin it for me at the moment for whatever reason... he’ll jump in again when I ask and usually will talk dirty in my ear while I touch myself. 

If he doesn’t want to go down on you that is his preference, and he’s entitled to it just as much as you are entitled to being sufficiently aroused before intercourse. 

I think most  people with a clit need at least 4 minutes of solid stimulation (after initial foreplay) to orgasm. I believe the average time to cum with a partner including foreplay is 11 min and 4 min for masturbation, but obviously this varies.

"dyb9ru3","BFF needs to check out the 'Out of the FOG' website, and I would suggest that you and she check [this link in particular](http://outofthefog.website/personality-disorders-1/borderline-mother-types) together.

I say together because it's likely she's going to find things on it which ring not only true, but horribly true, and she's going to both want to deny it and need the support of a close friend who can irrefutably say, no, you're not imagining it, let me quote chapter and verse on what happened, x, y, z, a, b, c, 1, 2, 3 times.

And then? BFF needs individual counseling to unpack these experiences and these feelings without pressure from her mom, her husband, or even from you, and to grieve that her mom *very clearly* has made her the scapegoat because she has dared to be her own person instead of her mother's puppet.

Both of you need to realize though and repeat that her mother would be doing this no matter WHAT you guys did in the past or do now. When BFF was a 'good girl' doing what her mother wanted, her mother STILL put her down, talked negatively about her, etc. Now that she's trying to have her own life, the abuse has stepped up - but even before, *it was still abuse*. Her mother can't stand that she's making her own decisions and the abuse is greater because BFF is trying to be her own independent person and might some day fully self-actualize to not allow her mother this level of influence and control, and her mother can't STAND that.

I mean, of course her mother's trying to push her to divorce and get full custody and move back home. How else can she have her scapegoat/whipping girl back full time? Plus, BONUS! Control via pawn, aka, granddaughter, to try and mold into scapegoat v. 2.0/golden girl to turn against BFF/whichever narc fodder JNM is in the mood for.

A message from me for your BFF: It really sucks to not have the loving, supportive mother you want and deserve. Marriage is hard and she isn't making it any easier. You don't have to cut her out of your life altogether if that's not what you want, but please find a therapist with experience with BPD/narcissistic family/family members who are addicts (the behaviors shared among these different types are very similar, and also similar to what you're going through with her). A good therapist will NOT push you to either cut contact ASAP *or* to sweep it under the rug just because she's your mother, and you deserve the chance to really look at your upbringing and your experiences with the help of a compassionate but professionally neutral (and appropriately trained) therapist. Learning to unpack and heal from your experiences will help you to define what boundaries work best for you, and to set them and then defend them - for your sake and your daughter's. Marriage counseling will probably also help, but take the time for one on one counseling so you can better define who you are and what you want without the burdensome roles of wife, daughter, mother on TOP of that.

You deserve to feel happy and fulfilled, and to feel happy and fulfilled, you need to find your own voice. Your husband seems contrite and wanting to support that, even if he isn't always perfect. Your mother, right now, wants 'your voice' only if it echoes what SHE is saying, and it's healthy for you to step back from that to figure out what your voice is. I wish you luck and success, and if all else fails? Remember what your own mother probably has said at some point. 'By their fruits shall ye know them.'

"dy9i2p1","I never understood why suicide is considered ""bad"". Objectively speaking, death is death. Human beings are the ones who create arbitrary connotations about which forms of death is acceptable and which ones are not...as if the infinitely expanding universe gives a fuck. For example, how is military or police service not universally viewed as indirect suicide? Why is ""sacrificing yourself for others"" viewed as inherently good and honorable, but killing yourself for your own personal reasons seen as selfish? IMHO nothing is more selfish than emotionally gaslighting suicidal people to stay alive, solely to benefit another person's finite existence. Like, how is hospice seen as humane and compassionate, but ending your life on your own terms the worst thing on planet Earth? Why is taking control of your life universally accepted as the superior way to live, but taking control of your own death frowned upon? It's all so damn stupid, fake, and made up. Everything man\-made is all fake, stupid, and made up. I feel like the more people realize that, the easier and more enjoyable our meaningless lives will be.

I don't think I will ever stop laughing at how important and contingent humans think we are in the big scheme of things, when we live at most 130 years \(give or take\), and the universe has existed and will continue to exist, with or without or presence, for billions of years. Like, even if our families are devastated by our deaths....guess what? They'll eventually die, too and cease to exist like every other living being who died. It's an ongoing stream of human generations living and dying no matter how painful we think it is. It legitimately, objectively does not matter in the big scheme of things. I wish everyone would just calm the fuck down about life and death, cuz it's really not that serious.

"dxvfrmt","There's nothing wrong with any of that, as long as your and others' traits are well balanced with the relevant, opposite traits.

It's okay to be compassionate, but only if it's balanced by logic, and a true understanding that first compassion can be an incredibly destructive force, and second that compassion has a tendency to trap those you want to help in a spiral of helplessness.

What I see now is that many men only have the positive and negative sides of ""feminine"" traits while having almost no masculine traits. Some are called soyboys, for good reason. They're likely weak people who can't even effectively help themselves, much less other people.

The best people I've met all have struck a balance between the masculine and the feminine. They have as many tools as possible to navigate the world.

If your BF still has issues from that, maybe he would find a therapist helpful. You go to the wedding and enjoy it. Let your BF know he is welcome, but you understand if he doesn't want to go with you. You don't apologize for going to your brother's wedding, or for having fun at it, or for having a sexual history from before you knew your BF, because none of those things are wrong.

So, don't apologize, kindly let your BF know he can choose to go to the wedding or not, and you are fine with either choice, and if your BF tries to make his upseted-ness your problem, tell him to maybe talk to a therapist about his issues.

And/or, if you're looking for how to make him more comfortable if he attends the wedding - make sure you keep appropriate boundaries when interacting with your ex and ex-FWBs - no flirty stuff.

"dxur4ty","One bad apple is enough to rot the basket... I see evil everywhere Jamma, everybody lies, but what I enjoy most overall is communication and truth when faced with arguments. Censorship and swiping bones under the rug rolled up inside the closet is more evil than any type of hateful critic or angry destructive conceptual low blows.

Its a game, we're here to play... so I rather spend my time with people who are true and are not going to stand silent in the face of injustice.

If they end up telling me, hey we're moving to this game, its got the rules we're looking for. I'm very likely to move and you'll never hear from me again.

Also at one point we'll have no more tears and laughs, and the only feeling these subs channel will be nauseous, we'll also move on and you'll never hear from us again.

I have cried all my tears, very vulnerably, while participating in the alpha/beta of SOTA. My emotions are genuine because Ultimas really changed who I am in the core and how I make my decisions when meta-playing is concerned.

But don't fool yourself, before, I thought in my naive youth that I learned because the lessons were left there ON PURPOSE by portalarium. Alas the lesson I learned after the facts are that yes indeed they had the intention to honor the virtues and the lore of ultimas, but once action was required because SOME IMPLEMENTATIONS of RMT were unethical, they stood there and licked Markee's hairy ass. FUCK.

FUCK THAT... I mean, at least leave ONE NPC within the game who is against this in PRINCIPLE.

The virtues taught me to be compassionate, but FUCK.

The tears are cried were not crocodile tears, I felt ripped apart from the inside... it is the appex of treachery for my fantasy side of things.

The real side of things is of course, obviously also a treachery so it was double painful to see all the people who were hurt by the DEAFENING SILENCE.

So I'm a very HAPPY customer, I would never help anyone defame or otherwise harm anyone at portalarium, they are jolly folks, I'm sure 99% of them are respectful and true gentlemen...

but my inner child, my fantasy side... obviously what I chose to spend my spare time on along with music creation... 

you see I'm an obvious, low class, poor nerd with an outdated machine and I waited for this lord british game since the SRC fiasco @EA/origin...

I thought King Gariott was kicked out of the project, forced to sell his idea for PEANUTS because of RMT inside pressure and conflict of interest.

But I was wrong...

So now the games, all the ultimas and Richard's legacy... taught me, not to EVER participate or engage with people with such attitudes and predisposition to censorship and silencing by indiference.

The lesson is that ascension is impossible when you push all thats bad in the unconscious... sure you'll look good, there will be pom poms all around and things will flow naturally and without effort, but at what price.

So no... its not ""telling"" you have no idea of the pain I endure, you do not know me and how ordinary and pathetic and fucking submitted I am to the system...

I am the underdog, I am BETA.

My feedback is the most valuable of all because following virtue has NOT been profitable, in all spheres. Yet I persevere.

I have less friends, less money, less ways to express my love, less freedom, less respect, less justice (if I abstract myself).

I still have love and hard work, like portalarium...

I'm a lucky guy all in all, because I prefer to die standing and free of the false gods, I am only the wiser. And I have a companion that chose the same path, nobody should worry about the stranger anymore, he found love and a calling.

What is very wrong tho, is that I think nobody cares.

So we're all playing a game, who's main character we chose to sweep under the rug because there nothing shiny WOW factor here, only complexity that can't be applied because structure we chose does not support it, programming technology shortcomings basically.

"dxs66ic","Then why don’t I have a shit attitude? Why do I get laid?

Okay... Clearly this isn’t getting through so I will be blunt. Believe what you want but you see other men in my position so just apply this to them. I am very sexually active and have been for 20 years. Think what you want about my sex life, I’ve already heard all the “man whore” comments you have many times so no need to bother with that. Now, I don’t look like Tom Cruise or Prince. That means there is something I’m doing right and you’re not.

Most people have at least some kind if excuse for having a shit attitude if they want. I certainly do. I’m short too and I have medical problems, I need a cane, and lived through a whole lot of child abuse. I could be a shit person if I wanted to and I would have an excuse. Especially to be shitty to women. My abusers were women.

The real truth is, again, that it’s on you to be cool and interesting. Nobody owes you their time or attention. So you having a toxic attitude, for whatever reason, is on you. Just like mine is on me. People should be respectful and compassionate. But there are limits. I listen to gay people, for example, when they tell me about what being gay is like. I don’t know. I’m straight. I don’t have that experience so I have to rely on people who do. But I don’t owe it to anyone, LGBT or otherwise, to sit and listen or even give them the time of day if I don’t want to. That’s a bit different because I do think education is the way to make the world better and we’re talking about legitimate bigotry here. I am, however, short. I do have this experience. And that experience, combined with the fact that all we’re really talking about is that you need to be a little cooler and a little more charming and confident to get a date. That’s what we’re really talking about.

So whatever reason you have for being a douche, that’s separate. If you’re a douche regardless people (including women) won’t want to be around you. That’s not fun. It’s toxic.

My second son was born on Sunday, so this is pretty fresh on my mind. I think back on my single life, times when I thought that I probably did not want kids, or when I did not see a path in my life that led to having a traditional family, and remember reading answers to this question, “is it worth it?” And thinking that all of the answers were too sentimental or just cliched platitudes. Even brutally honest answers seemed overly dramatic.


But for me, the moment my first son was born, everything became more vivid. I felt like Judy Garland stepping out of sepia-toned Kansas and into Technicolored Munchkin Land.


I was one of those kids that questioned whether I might be a secret robot, or a replicant. All of my memories and emotions implanted. I never took intro psych, but I gather that it is pretty common to go through the whole, “I live in a simulation and nothing is real phase during adolescence.”


Well, I never really grew out of it. I just replaced it.  I studied anthropology and life sciences in college. I came to understand emotions as complex behavioral adaptions, incidental chemical responses that can be ignored, manipulated, or indulged as one saw fit. I never felt like I really “loved” anyone. I spent a good bit of time studying love, trying to figure out what it was. I took a couple of cultural psychology courses under this great anthropologist. I came to the conclusion, under his expert tutelage, that love was a cultural construct used to categorize a host of chemical responses associated with the successful rearing of a family, and that the expression of that construct varied greatly, especially between eastern and western cultures.


Essentially, I decided that none of it was “real,” so it could be ignored. I have always tried to be kind and compassionate, but I decided that I did not believe in familial or romantic love. being the product of a teen pregnancy, and never having the ideal nuclear family growing up. I think that I was trying to inoculate myself against the pain of loss and disappointment.


But, I met my wife. She already had a daughter from a previous marriage. After being in a series of long term relationships in which I pretended to be in love (see aforementioned non-belief in the stuff) I felt comfortable not pretending for the first time in my life. For the first time in my life, I was not looking for a way out. I wanted to be right where I was. The birth of my son was, organically, the next logical step. And it broke down every wall that I had built for myself. it felt surreal the entire time she was pregnant. But when I watched him come out, the Dr. pulled him straight up into the air, and onto my wife’s chest, I just laid down over both of them while he nursed, and I cried, sobbing in a way that I have not since I was a kid. And I just held both of them like that for a while. I have never been the same. I have access to parts of my personality and my mind that I intentionally shut down years ago.


Everything is more real. Fear is more real. Fear of loss. Fear of disappointment. Love is real. Cultural construct, chemical brain cocktail. Don’t even care. I know that the bond I have with these boys and with their mother is rare, and it is beautiful, and I would fight for it and i would die for it. Life is nothing but a sum of experiences, and my life would have been incomplete and even inconsequential without this experience. It has made me less petty. It has taught me patience.  My capacity for happiness is well beyond anything I could have imagined. Just picking up my oldest boy, and holding him, taking in his stinky strawberry dirt smell, I get a wave of that same feeling I had the moment he was born. I could not imagine a higher high than that.",1524208523,"i have always tried to be kind and compassionate, but i decided that i did not believe in familial or romantic love. being the product of a teen pregnancy, and never having the ideal nuclear family growing up.","kind and compassionate","compassionate",NA,FALSE,"kind and compassionate","kind",NA,NA,0

My parents weren't physically abusive (well, she did beat me up one time for missing curfew, but that was obviously my fault /s), but they ignored me, treated me with disdain....and what they really thought was laced like acid through what they said.

""you can be anything you want to be"" (but really we all know you're a fuck up and a loser, who'll amount to nothing, just like your bloody father)

Honestly I think it's harder to type children. They're still learning and taking in everything since they are freshly popped into this world. I don't think little children have enough experience to really have a type developed yet. They start developing their dominant cf from the time they're born, but it usually isn't fully developed until about 13 or 14 just imo. 

I think you can start picking up patterns in how their dominant functions is growing and developing when they are around 7-12

Anyways, some patterns I picked up of kids with different functions ~~

Fe kids- usually kids with Fe are really sensitive to other people's feelings and needs, and always want to make people comfortable and keep the peace. They love to fit in and seek approval from their peers and dislike disappointing others. They also have a really hard time with critism and are very sensitive. 

Se kids- honestly, a lot of kids may seem Se because usually young children are pretty big energy in general, but real Se children are just extra wired. They always want to be involved with something (like sports or dancing for instance). They are usually pretty skilled in doing hands on things and are usually fast learners.  They're also quite the performers,  and like to keep people entertained. 

Ni kids- they have a very mature and street-wise vibe to me. They seem to learn how the world works pretty early on, and how people works, and just have a deeper understanding of things than most children their age and even some adults haha. They're usually very quiet &amp; mellow, but when they do talk they say something pretty wise and thought out. They also seem pretty spaced tf out to me most the time lmao. Also clumsy 

Te kids- these kids have very good leadership skills and are very strong willed and if they want something done, they get it tf done. They are usually very blunt and straightforward and tell things like they are. They also have a lot of confidence and are goal getters that try to be the best in everything. 

Si kids- seem very down-to-earth and sensible. Not as dreamy and imaginative as some children are. Very responsible and like to have a routine and may be uncomfortable if something new happens unexpectedly. And also may be less likely to do risky things (generally not daredevils) and are pretty reserved &amp; uptight and follow the rules pretty well. 

Sorry for not writing about Ne, Fi &amp; Ti. I'm too lazy to rn xD I might edit them on later tho idk.




But I did find a tumblr post about the functions as children. Pretty stereotypical but I'll copy and paste it here: (creds to funkymbtinfiction) 



Te-dom: bosses other kids around, organizing them into groups to get things done or play specific games.
Fe-dom: talks about how things make them feel, wants to fit in, good at comforting other kids, with a tendency toward open sympathy.
Si-aux: likes routine and to be shown exactly how to do it.
Ni-aux: tends to have big dreams, learn things quickly.
Ne-dom: talks a lot about new ideas, tends to not finish anything they start, has trouble concentrating on one thing for very long.
Se-dom: is always out doing something or engaged in something stimulating, tends to be hyperactive and “fearless.” (You might find them climbing on the roof, or skateboarding down the stairs.)
Fi-aux: very sensitive but won’t always say what’s wrong.
Ti-aux: very logical but tends to just … get up and fix it.
Ti-dom: logical, detached, likes to take things apart to see how they work. Can be blunt and don’t understand why something is an insult. Tends to ask a lot of questions about… everything.
Fi-dom: very sensitive and compassionate, but not always forthcoming with what has made them upset. Tends to resist doing things they do not want to do.
Ne-aux: their attention moves quickly to new things, often not finishing what they were working on before.
Se-aux: they are always on the move, highly active, and sometimes a bit reckless.
Ni-dom: imaginative and inventive, with thoughts out of the blue no spurred by external reality; learns new things quickly and is easily bored if nothing in their environment changes.
Si-dom: likes specific instructions and to be shown how to do things before trying them out; cares very much about their external environment, and is upset and caught at a loss if their routine is disturbed or someone acts out of character.
Fe-aux: very sensitive and compassionate, but also worried about not fitting in / other kids not liking them.
Te-aux: shows signs of organizational skills, can be blunt and likes things with “facts” involved. (Si-Te kids often like to do “real things,” instead of play make-believe.)

"dx6bun3","&gt; I thoroughly disagree with your argument, though it was well argued and a pleasure to read. Though Nechayev certainly has a chilly relationship with Picard, I think that it mostly results from a sort of pragmatism that is sometimes justified, but usually misplaced.

As someone who has suffered for 36 out of my 41 years of life, because of people like Alynna Nechayev holding power in real world positions, I find it very difficult to emotionally tolerate anyone making excuses for her, or for anyone else similar.  Even assuming that she was not genuinely psychopathic as I have suggested earlier, she was at least myopic, and responsible for the Cardassian treaty, which destroyed the lives of countless people.

Organisations in the real world can and do experience incalculable harm, as a result of personalities like Nechayev or Jellico being in positions of authority within them.  They alienate and often are responsible for the removal of people who can contribute far more to the organisation's wellbeing than they themselves do, because they usually only get into their positions as a result of ruthlessness and authoritarianism, rather than anything truly beneficial.  Such people should not be apologised for, but should be removed from said positions as soon as they are identified.

"dwmg2ne","Thanks, This is a really good comment. 

The dog is already chipped and in her name, with all the legalities in place. (In my country it has to be done by a certain time). It is her dog, but I'm not sure if she is into her that much. She doesn't take her out much and finds her irritating at times since the dog is high energy. I can see where you are coming from with her having at least the dog and I guess you are right. I have my doubts about the level of care she would provide, but I guess that's another conversation. 

I'll try to explain some of the reasons I find our future impossible, but I do not  want to give an impression that one or two things are the cause, but the bigger picture.

She is very lazy. She will spend most of her days sitting on the couch and complaining about being bored. I have a lot on my table and work a lot. My work is high stress and I feel her attitude only increases my stress levels, since she won't be taking care of all the small thing in the house etc. By no means do I expect her to be a traditional house wife, on the contrary. But when she has so much time on her hands and not much responsibilities, I feel like she could contribute a lot more. Everything falls on me. I know I am enabling this behavior by doing the things myself and letting her of the hook, but I don't believe in commanding people around but actually having them understand what needs to be done to benefit everyone. She refuses to understand it while it is crystal clear. Now and then she'll admit to it and try to pick up the slack, but that won't last for more than a few days. 

She has everything anyone could ask and more, but I don't think she appreciates that. She has a lot of negativity in her.

She can be very rude to people. She is kind and compassionate, but she has a side to her that is fowl. When that side comes out, it just breaks my heart that she can be so harsh and judgmental.

I feel terrible listing this, but it certainly is a issue. She used to take good care of her self. During the 5 years we have been together she has gained quite a bit weight and poor skins etc. for all the crap food she likes to eat. This has affected me weather I like to admit it or not.

I'm not sure about if this is it. I really really hope and wish that I could find the reasons to keep going. I am ready to do anything and feel like I've already done a lot, but it needs equal commitment from her that I am just not seeing. 


After writing this list, I feel terrible. I am not perfect at all - I am away a lot and pretty much have a whole another life she is not aware of (work). It can be very hard to get my true feelings out and I say ""it will be okay"" a lot, when I know it won't. I lie to her about my feelings so that she doesn't get worried. I go out for long hikes with the dog just to get away from her when I am very stressed, rather than tell her to give me some space and a break. 

My work has come up quite a bit now, so I think that should be addressed as well . I work in intensive care with a lot of tragedy and long working hours. I am also part of the administrative management, so on top of all the ICU-stress, I have the administrative side. After a long shift that can be too crazy to even tell about, it's very frustrating to be her counselor on meaningless things that has happened to her during that time and not get a opportunity to de-brief myself.

Sorry for the long text. I guess this whole thing is a bit cathartic to write down.

"dwj3c49","That was the most coherent and compassion explanation of this issue that I've yet read. You beautifully articulated things that I have struggled with. So thank you for that. 

I can't change your view because I think you already see that your problem isn't with your views. You already seem to have a very compassionate and thoughtful view of the world, and a willingness to honestly question your point of view. That is the most anyone can ask of anyone intellectually. 

What I can say is that - like me - your issue is with your own sense of self-worth. You're compassionate but you aren't being self-compassionate. Damn, I have to run. Briefly: Take a break from reading news that makes you feel bad about yourself. Take some time and practice self-love and self-compassion. You can't help change the world if you're not taking care of yourself. I was in exactly the same situation and it was what I needed. I suspect that it's what you need too. Take care.

*Edit: To fill in a couple of the things I wanted to say: It's understandable for marginalized groups to feel angry and to express that anger. That they can now express those frustrations and be heard and respected is great and a sign of progress. But that doesn't mean that anything about this situation is necessarily your fault. You didn't choose to be privileged any more than they chose to be marginalized. We were all born into this. As long as you're being aware and working to make society better, then you're doing all that you need to do. A big part of what we can do as white men is just to make space and protect the space of others to have their voice, but you being privileged doesn't mean that you're always wrong, or that they're always right, or that you have nothing positive to add to the conversation. 

The only thing that you need to do differently is get better at loving yourself. When you can do that then you'll be better able to hear their anger and respect where it's coming from without taking it personally. You'll be better able to listen to what they have to say and respond compassionately, understanding where they're coming from. You'll be better able to judge when it's appropriate to argue with someone and when it's more helpful just to listen and show respect. You do not and should not need to give up your self-respect.

"dwedyx8","I’ve lived in Alabama my whole life, grew up with dogs, zoom worms, and a red ryder, I was the chaplain and then pledge captain of a very religious christian fraternity at Auburn. Got saved in high school in a baptist church, then studied the bible like crazy and became a “fundamentalist” because they actually followed the bible and had a defensible, coherent interpretation of it that had been a majority interpretation amongst the anabaptists and their descendants. I was raised conservative and am now the only non-republican in my extended family (Socially “liberal”, largely pro-market, strongly second amendment) the only person I know who meditates, the only person I interact with who is pro-choice, the only person I know who thinks morality can be found outside of divine decree. I grew up on a cotton farm and had to feed the cows, chickens, and goats and cut trees and fix fences and I bitched the whole time to myself about how hard it was until I got older and realized what a gift I had been given. I systematic-theologied myself right out of christianity while preparing and giving sermons in college and then went through 3 years of hell trying to convince myself of it again and feeling like there was nothing to replace it with. I can honestly say that having tasted every flavor from evangelical free-will, to biblical literalist, to hopeless nihilist to looking for a moderate perch in Joseph Campbells archetypes, to 4 horseman atheist, to Sam Harris rational buddha atheist, to Hardcore stoicism... and I can say without any reservation that my life would have been infinitely better without the influence of christianity. I would have avoided *years* of pointless agony over sexual sins, and thought crimes, and lack of belief, it would have made my parents 100x better parents, would have helped be so much more compassionate and less selfish, more forgiving and understanding, more eager to seek out what was actually the best thing to do for real people suffering here rather than the imaginary person monitoring the neurotic voice in my head for lustful daydreams. And everything I ever thought I “got” from my religion, I found in greater abundance, with fewer if any downsides, and (most importantly) with no bad reasoning necessary, in stoicism, and buddhism, either of which would be better than christianity, but when taken together flesh out a staggering amount of what I think Sam would say are the objective facts about morality and meaning. 

I love christians and conservatives. For whatever reasons, I am much more sympathetic to the idiocy on the right than the left right now, at least the “decent people” block. I am intimately aware of just how great their moral fiber is, if their code wasn’t bugged with christianity they’d probably be more sensible than the left. I think the portrayal of the right in the media is despicable and dishonest, and vice versa. Everyone with a “normal” brain wants at least their own self and those they care about to have better lives. Confusion about what “better” is and how to get there are the only things that produce all the division and “idiocy” we see on both sides. Ideas lead to behaviors, bad people for the most part just have bad ideas in play, bugs in the code corrupting their output. Perhaps you don’t see unreason in the same sort of keystone role? Or there must be still some discrepancy between just how sloppy his thinking is, or to what extent that sloppiness will spread along with his ideas? It just seems patently obvious to me (perhaps I am taking for granted just how much my particular experiences have familiarized me with the subjects) that increasing the popularity (or influence more specifically) of objective, defensible reasoning as the single, respected source of knowledge that we can all converge upon is much more important than finding the easiest and gentlest way to bring christians to the next stop on moderate religion roundabout. Moderate religion is just the neverending cycle of secular reasoning making some parts of a religion look bad enough that people find a new way of looking at it so that the conflict disappears (“it was an illusion all along, the text really meant _______ all along!”)

I totally get where you’re coming from. I definitely don’t talk like this to them, but I do talk about these positions and they get pushed around a bit every time family gets together, but thats where rhetoric and staying calm and impersonal come in. I totally agree that we should be careful, serious, and compassionate, but I think most people are can be effectivey reasoned with if you can stay calm and look for clues as to rhetoric rather than being triggered by simply hearing their bad ideas pronounced. 

I hope to start creating content to help provide a sympathetic and compassionate (though firm) perspective on just what ideas can explain the apparent “evil” on both sides. Sam kind of did that for me with regard to the left. I kinda hoped Rubin could do it for the right, but he just doesn’t seem to have the horsepower up top. Somebody needs to give a decent defense of them as people at least. Lord knows they deserve it lol.

"dw78a7r","One night a year or so ago when I was riding out with the local PD, we pulled into a gas station so he could grab a coffee.

I forget how the subject came up, but it finished about ten minutes later with him essentially admitting that he used to be an alcoholic. That a number of years ago when he was active-duty military, a cop pulled him over, realised he was well over 0.08, and also realised that by arresting him for it it would end his military career. Instead the cop got a friend to come pick him up and drive him back to the army base. 

He said that night was the last night he drank. That the next day he realised both what he had been doing to himself and his family, and also what a massive break the cop had given him.

He told me he sobered up and quit drinking that day. And he later went on to leave the military and eventually became a police officer.

Someone close to me calls herself compassionate but yet won't accept the truth of reality and in fact will turn a blind eye to evils in order to continue peacefully.

"dvs09g4","I'm not debating that Jesus was ""an amazing person"". But read what I put. It's not nitpicking, it's what Christianity, at its roots, is. It's clear that sin is not excusable, but is something that everyone can repent from. Jesus saved people, but he told them they must turn from sin or face hell. Jesus personally told people they would be damned if they didn't change and flipped the tables in the tabernacle when he was upset with them. He wasn't a ""nice guy"", he was compassionate but deadly serious. 

If you aren't religious, why are you so upset that the bible is clearly anti-sin? And if you haven't read what I put, nor the bible, why do you act as if you have a comprehensive understanding of it? 

The bible said not to condemn others, so Jesus obviously didn't sin by not stoning gays. Such a claim would be laughable. I would be aghast if anyone were to stone gays. But, according to the bible, gayness is a sin. That's an indisputable biblical fact. Just like how the bible condemns lying, adultery, anger, jealously, and a multitude of other things.

"dvlxn22","My relationship with Finn is weird because I think he's my favorite fictional character ever, and that feels a bit wrong to me. I guess it's my common sense just saying ""You have all of humanity's works at your disposal and you go with a dumb cartoon character as your favorite?"" and I'm just like yeah I guess. It easily could be that AT is just recent and once it ends I'll move on, but it feels like more than that.

And even with that I'm not sure WHY I like Finn so much. People always tout his character development as a grand achievement, but while I do like his development I feel like that would only make him go from ""generic hero protagonist"" to ""mature generic hero protagonist,"" but there's a quality about Finn I like a lot that I can't really define for myself which can be fucking annoying. I was talking to some fools online who said Finn was boring now and lost most of his personality, and I knew (or felt I guess, this shit is subjective) that they were wrong but I couldn't put into words what's interesting about Finn. Shit, maybe he isn't interesting and I just project all this shit onto him so that he's super cool, ha.

Moving on, I love early seasons Finn. He was just so fun! He was a firecracker, always bouncy and hyped to do anything, but there was more to him than that; he was a surprisingly dangerous little bastard. His love for fighting evil and desire to always do justice made him really interesting, and I always kind of thought he was off in a way, like kind of feral (I probably only think that because it fits in nicely with him being raised by dogs)? Like how his whole thing was killing everything that looked evil to him. He was charming as shit though, I get how early Finn could be annoying to some people but I found him endearing as hell, little crazy hero boy. Also, like season 2-5 Finn has such a wonderful VA, I don't know what it was about Jeremy Shada's vocal chords at that time but they sound so wonderful to listen to. Early-ish Finn is like my dream voice for ""young heroic male,"" and after that I feel like he either got less emotive or something or his voice just naturally changed in a way I didn't like as much.

The more modern Finn is still good, but I'm kind of inclined to say he's less interesting just by the fact that it feels like his maturity just leads him to inaction more. He isn't out there kicking as much butt so he seems more boring to me, I guess. I feel like he's less proactive when it comes down to it, which doesn't make for an amazing hero. That's not to say I still don't love him or think the modern character is shit, but I guess I value what's more fun to just watch on screen than a character that has more depth and nuance. I think, give or take some hiccups, his development was pretty impressive, but it unfortunately resulted in a Finn that I just don't think is as entertaining as he used to be.

There are some parts of his development I'm not a fan of, like how he hasn't physically aged at all. Maybe it's shallow but it feels like such a missed opportunity that the show couldn't age up his design along with his personality and voice; yes they draw him taller sometimes, but only like 30% of the time and even then I'd expect more from him aging 5 years than just gaining a few inches. Physical changes are a very important part of growing up so it just sucks we'll at best see a flash forward of him in the future. I don't really blame the show since I bet the network didn't let them change his design and it would just be hard for the boarders to consistently depict something like him gradually getting taller, but I still have to consider it a flaw.

I also think when it comes to character relationships some have been done very well (Jake, Ice King, Fern) with others less impressive. I don't really get why the show made it clear to Finn that PB isn't just a sweet dainty princess with all the moral ambiguity junk they threw in, yet it still feels like Finn sees her that way. Like, compare Rattleballs to Thin Yellow Line, and the only thing that's changed is Finn at the last second goes to help Banana Guard 16, which feels like such nothing considering he's had 2 years of development since Rattleballs. I really wish Finn would get that PB isn't perfect but it feels like he never did, so I think that's pretty disappointing. Finn and PB still have a very interesting relationship but I wish this part of it was changed.

Another thing I don't like is that he seems to suck a lot more at fighting now. Remember early seasons Finn? When he would take on a dozen monsters with his fists, banished Hunson Abadeer by himself, got his legs broken and barely blinked, or lifted a 100 ton monster into a pit? Now it feels like most of the fights he gets into he loses which is ludicrous because if anything he should be even more badass than he was in his younger days. I think this might be a problem where early on Finn was more of an archetype than a real person so he was given free reign to do this stuff, but now that he's written more realistically the show feels it isn't realistic for him to do stuff like this, but it just makes him feel lamer. One of the parts of Finn I like a lot is how he's incredibly sweet and compassionate but will also never hesitate to stab a bastard for being evil or rip a monster's head off, but he doesn't get to do stuff like that as much anymore.

"dvdiffa","I don’t agree with this. This is pretty postmodern thinking: “who cares?” I care, because choices have consequences, the choice to marry someone of the same sex, or the choice to be trans. And before you tell me “it’s not a choice to them, it’s biological,” there’s many, many ways humans are born one way but choose to act another way, for example people with pedophile urges. That’s the concept of sin, we’re all naturally driven to sin in different ways. If you experience same sex attraction, you’re not alone in your experience with other gay people, every human experiences the urge to sin. Yes, some people experience an urge to sin more than other people, but life is unfair. If someone chooses to be gay because they think it’s unfair that life is so unfair, then I’m not going to blame them, it’s a more difficult position, but I’m also not going to deny that they’re acting infantile. The ultimate goal is to not act in accordance to our desires, as infants do, but in accordance to rationality and morality. But today we’re increasingly acting not according to morality, which we’re increasingly not studying or reflecting on, but in accordance to our desires. And then we wonder why there is so much dysfunction.

As an example of a consequence of gay marriage, reflect on how redefining marriage means you’re redefining parenting, and redefining parenting means you’re redefining childhood. How does it feel for a son to not have a mother or a daughter to not have a father? Well you can listen to a daughter speak about this: https://youtu.be/_BP_QmFC7BA

I don’t know enough about consequences of being trans well enough but personally I believe it’s similar. 

OP, you asked what I would do if a child came out as trans. I think if a child came out as trans, I would give them all the support, access to medical professionals (psychologists for example), etc, without allowing them to transition. I’d do more research into how many people regret becoming trans, I know there’s a number of teenagers who went through “a sex change” only to regret doing it a few years later  and share that information with my child. I’d only let my child go through “a sex change” as a very last resort. I’d also look at their urge to be the other gender as a symptom, not as the actual problem itself, meaning I’d see their urge to become the other gender as a weird, confusing symptom of something larger and more important going on in their life that needs addressing.

He did not want a car that would hug a corner, he wanted the best gas mileage.

""Uh,"" he said again, ""Used. I'm looking for something cheap, like five thousand max.""

""Right this way,"" I said, gesturing. ""We just got some new stock in, I think it would be a great fit for you. So what do you do?""

""Uh,"" He said again. This guy would give a public speaking teacher a nervous tic. ""I work for a an engineering firm.""

""Ughh,"" he said, ""I'm moving to Texas in a couple months, work transfer. I won't have to deal with snow.""

""Oh,"" I said, and made to clap him on the back. Instead, he flew forward, smashing his face into the window.

But the power struggle between the intelligent and compassionate, but overly fanatic and possibly too authoritarian Snowball (Trotsky) and the ruthless and brutal Napoleon (Stalin) ends in Napoleon running off Snowball when it looks like he may win the election, and he quickly uses his guard dogs (secret police) and the loyal Squealer(propaganda) to keep the animals in line through fear, causes suffering through his poorly thought out plans (the 5-year plans), and gradually corrupts the original Old Majors teachings while claiming they are the same as ever (Socialism in One Country), and the pigs soon enrich themselves at the other animals expense.


Eventually the the Seven Commandments are reduced to ""All Animals are Equal, but some Animals are more Equal than Others.""

"duw55av","&gt;Before I go on I feel I must tell y'all that I have taken a lot of drugs in my life. A LOT. Ecstasy, coke, acid.. Honestly it would be a shorter list if I told you what I haven't tried... So maybe with all the drugs it's triggered some psychosis of some sort?

If you've been taking street drugs, especially, it's risky - if you've had benign hallucinations since you were a child that could already be a clear sign that your system would be sensitive or kind of easy to tip over this way or that way.

And, when you take drugs that are toying around with your normal perceptions - in the amounts and frequency you seem to describe - it's more than simply likely that without intending to, you've been furnishing the circumstances in your brain over a long span of time to arrive at a place where you're now experiencing these hallucinations.

&gt;On drugs mostly, but now I even hear it when I'm not under the influence of drugs...

The thing is, it sounds like it could be a kind of [HPPD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hallucinogen_persisting_perception_disorder) and you need to go see a competent psychiatric doctor.

If you're going into a psychiatric ward, your anxiety around going into the ward itself also might color your experiences of it but ultimately if they determine that they need to prescribe to you, for example, some specific anti-psychotic to relieve you of your hallucinatory symptoms they do essentially need to monitor you to be able to do a good job.

&gt;I don't want to be judged and put on meds

You might only have to take a specific medication for a short duration of time until those hallucinations go away.

I would say you need to find a doctor that is both competent and compassionate, but you're probably going to be a better judge of who that might be because you know your circumstances better.

Anyway, having read your post my first instinct was that you should see a doctor; especially because you're already taking psychotropic drugs anyway, which by the way I'd say you're kind of already ""on meds"" as it is - judging by what you're experiencing maybe not meds that might be right for you.. 😊

I've worked with children for 10+ years, ranging from Montessori settings to a behavioral school paraprofessional and mental health aide. 

A couple of small punches to keep in your arsenal:

1. Sing-song instructions. I know this might sound like *pff, okay, sure* but I swear by it. I used to have 18 two year olds in a classroom with myself and one other teacher. During times of transition we were required to line everyone up on the far wall seated, and then move the line from sitting, to standing and out the door. How in all that is holy was I supposed to corral eighteen toddlers!? Straight up, I made up a song. I clapped and gave dramatic pauses along with individual eye contact with anybody who hadn't begun to follow just yet. Within a week I had done it. Everyone seated in a matter of minutes. 

2. Give your attention to those that *are* doing what they should be doing. Children crave attention, and will attempt to gain it by any means necessary. Ooh and awe over those that are doing the right thing, make an example out of them for everyone to see and hear. If you begin to ignore the negative behaviors (obviously those that aren't hurtful or dangerous) you will slowly but surely begin to notice the cries for positive attention instead of tantrums. 

3. Don't give in! It's your classroom, not theirs. Set up your rules and stick to them. If little Susie can't cope that she has to put her shoes on to go outside, she doesn't go outside. Repeat, repeat, repeat. Be compassionate, but strong. Phrases like ""I understand you don't like it."" or ""I can see you're upset."" will affirm that the child is being heard, but not that it's your job to make them happy 100% of the time. It's your job to teach them, and sometimes that means teaching them you don't always get everything you want. 

Repetitive phrases are your friend. Someone hits/bites/spits? ""Ouch!"" ""That hurts me/him/her!"" ""That's my/his/her body!"" - pick up the injured party and repeat the phrases to the aggressor. Picking up the aggressor to pull them away might seem natural, you want to remove the threat, but it's really just added attention and sometimes reinforces the behavior.

"duo48ps","&gt; So admittedly I went into the movie expecting the worse, because of the whole rotten tomatoes controversy

What controversy are you talking about? Is this the conspiracy that RT artificially inflates Marvel movies while burying DC movies or something?

Warner Bros, the company that produces the DC movies, owns RT. Why would they hurt their own brand?

&gt; Tchalla is Boring He just doesn't have any character traits besides being compassionate to a fault. He apparently only learns that racism exists when Killmonger tells him.

T’Challa is compassionate, but also stoic, thoughtful, stuck in the past (until the end), over-confident, worried he won’t live up to his farher’s legacy, and on and on. He’s a well rounded character.

He’s also accuetly aware of the racism affecting black people outside of Wakanda, Killmonger doesn’t enlighten him to it, he enlightens him to the notion that Wakanda can *do something about it*.

&gt; The CGI is terrible When I heard from early reviews that the movie was supposedly beautiful i was initally excited, but most of Wakanda looks like the star wars prequels, it doesnt have a unique artsyle and the movie had moments when the CGI took me entirely out of it, like with the rhinos.

Personally I thought the CGI was hit or miss. The rhinos didn’t seem real to me, but the city absolutely did. The setting of Wakanda was visually stunning and full of life. I didn’t get a prequel vibe from it at all.

&gt; Wakanda doesn't make sense as a country Has no one wandered into that forest in the 21st century?

One of Wakanda’s five tribes is dedicated to boarder security, and outside of the hologram or whatever it just looks like small farming villages. They have a cover.

Wakanda’s abilities are hidden, not its existence. They pretend to be a resource-poor tiny kingdom not worth caring about.

&gt; Is SHIELD, the most advanced intelligence agency in the world ( which knew the exsistance of Black Panther as seen in previous movie's easter eggs) unwilling to disclose the true nature of one the most powerful country in the world to the rest of the Earth.

It would appear that SHIELD (was) aware of Wakanda, sort of. That said, they regularly send out spies and agents to help their cause. What would an extremely isolationist country do with these resources? Obfuscation and espionage to keep up the ruse.

&gt; Why do they determine the leader to be the strongest fighter? shouldn't it be the wisest or fairest? 

Well it’s a ritual. And it seemed to me that the tradition was to keep the kingship along a family bloodline, most of the tribes didn’t request a challenge, only the Jibari tribe did and its likely they don’t try that very often.

Also this is a weird knock. Its a country heavily steeped in tradition - a tradition of fighting. The first Black Panther was someone strong enough to defeat his enemies and unite four out of the five tribes. So they value strength, that should be clear!

&gt; The romance between T'challa and his girlfriend is developed poorly.

There wasn’t a lot of time to fully develop the romance. That’s not an excuse, I agree it wasn’t the strongest part of the movie.

"duh1n32","Sure, if you're up for it. I should mention it is on sale on pretty much all other platforms right now though.

ELI5.

First things first, you begin the game a short while after the end of BG1. You are rounding up the last of Sarevok's supporters who are hiding in a tomb and once this is complete you meet with the Grand Dukes and you are sent to Dragonspear to fight against a Crusade. After defeating the Crusade you are framed for murder and exiled from the city of Baldur's Gate, as you leave you are reunited with Imoen and the BG2 gang. You and she then pass out and roll credits. 

Next, the plot, which is about your growing connection to Bhaal and centred heavily on the area of Dragonspear, the movement of the Crusade and its leader Caelar Argent.   
Caelar is a lawful good aasimar, she is the chief antagonist of the game and she is leading the rapidly growing Crusade from Dragonspear castle. Dragonspear was invaded by demons a decade ago and the losses were high with people killed or pulled into the Nine Hells before the gate to the Hells was finally sealed. Caelar's motivations at the start of the game are explicitly vague; she says things like that they are going to change the world, that future generations will look back at this as the turning point of history and that *the Crusade is the dawn that will banish the night*. 
It becomes apparent toward the end of the game that her goal is to lead her crusade into the Nine Hells. She *says* this is to rescue the dead of the aforementioned demon wars but really she doesn't believe this to be possible and is really doing it to rescue the soul of her uncle.
It turns out as a girl she sold her soul to a demon and her uncle -a famous paladin- traded his soul for hers. Ridden with guilt she determined to save him and thus manipulated hundreds (thousands?) of people into doing something she knew wouldn't work. 
Caelar ultimately fails and so she decides to sell her soul to the same demon who imprisoned her uncle and then fights you by his side. 
Ladies and gentlemen, your *lawful good* Caelar Argent.

I should note that since beating the game I have found out that apparently you can convince her to fight by your side against this demon, but she still offers to serve him and you have to talk her out of it.

The overall story for SoD is good, some of the sidequests are fun and the character stuff is solid. It's more that the Caelar-focused ending is kind of wonky. 
Like, why does Caelar sell her soul to the devil? Because she lost? That seems a weak excuse as it doesn't seem like she values her life so much and she has nothing left by then. Why does she even consider it? 

I personally don't get if Caelar is supposed to be righteous and compassionate -but arrogant or crazy enough that she doesn't consider the cost of her actions.  Or if she is manipulative and evil as her plans would indicate. 

When I first discovered the ""open the gate to hell plan"" it was her shady adviser that was talking with a demon so I presumed he must have been stringing her along.

Once you become solid with that, then you can start exploring how to let your natural affinity to be nice and work with other people be compatible with your responsibility to yourself. If someone pressures you to do something that hurts you and benefits them, you should explain how you think it hurts you.

"dtxy8q2","I had to jump into this conversation to lend my personal experience. 

I too had a friend that I would describe as ""close to."" Friends for years (since elementary school). I moved and we kept in contact as long distance friends well beyond I graduated college. When we were younger we'd take turns visiting each other over the summer. I even lived with her in her parent's home for a year, after I graduated college, while I was job hunting. 

I would always describe her as kind, funny, and caring. She helped me work through a lot of stuff, and when I lived with her I saw her take a few people under her wing as a kind of guidance thing. ""This person was in drug rehab after years of drug abuse. I'm helping her adjust to technology now that she's clean"" I thought it was so nice, even if I felt the way she spoke to the person was a bit condescending. 

That's why I was so shocked when doubtful thoughts wouldn't go away. When I got married, she was a bride'smaid and she threw away the wayfinding signs I asked her to make. On my honeymoon she called me to ask for a favor, and was mad when I told her I didn't appreciate her bothering me over something so small while I was on my honeymoon. She replied that what she was asking wasn't hard to do, and she'd do it for me if I had asked. Wasn't the point. 

Things came to a head and I confronted her in a phone call where she showed zero compassion for me or the struggles I was having in regards to our friendship. That was my point of no return. It crushed me. 

After that phone call, my husband pointed out that every time I visited her I ended up crying. (I would call him during my visits to her) and he told me that I never seemed excited to visit/see her. Not as excited as I am to see other friends. 

Then I gave myself permission to look at her behavior. Honestly evaluate it. I judged her to be kind and compassionate, but in reality she would tell me how compassionate she was (by bragging) and I would take her at her word. Never in the history of our friendship did she ever apologize to me. Not after she hurt me. Not after a disagreement. Not after I would apologize. I realized her ""taking people under her wing"" seemed more like telling people what to do. People who need guidance and want someone to lead them for a while. I remembered odd moments where she'd talk about a group of friends, and then never speak about them again. When I'd ask what happened to them she'd become dismissive or say she didn't remember why, but she decided she didn't want to hang out with them any more. ... little things I never deemed important before. 

More importantly, I realized that I was afraid to tell her things. Sometimes she'd have an opinion I wouldn't agree with, but I'd stay silent ""for the sake of our friendship."" Well, that's what I told myself at the time. I made a lot of small sacrifices ""for the sake of the relationship"" with her. Minor things she wouldn't be bothered to do. I kept thinking, ""Oh, I don't want to lose our friendship over this."" But now that I think about it... it's ridiculous to think disagreeing with someone would end a friendship, or make someone unforgivably mad at me. Maybe I wanted it to end. My husband was right. I wasn't happy in that relationship. No matter how much I wanted to be happy. We'd get along and share inside jokes and liked the same things, but there was that underlying... thing. I still can't tell you what it is. 

I was unhappy and afraid to speak up. Of course, I finally did speak up and she dismissed my feelings.   now I know-- even before I confronted her--my heart knew she would dismiss me. I knew she didn't care. I just wouldn't admit it. 

I was crushed, but I was also embarrassed. I was embarrassed at how much time I spent defending her. All those years I convinced myself she was a great friend--this person who couldn't be bothered to apologize to me. Ever. 

That's my experience. I didn't start to believe something was wrong until after I started my journey learning about BPD (because of my mom). At the end of that phone call she let me know there was room in her wedding for me, and we just never spoke again. On my end, the friendship is over. There wasn't a large terrible explosion of a fight. There wasn't a confrontation. No declaration that our friendship was at an end. Just a statement of my feelings being dismissed by her, and my quiet realization that she wasn't actually a friend. And her open invite to be in her wedding, should I choose to accept. 

Before I let myself even entertain the notion that she wasn't a good friend, I said similar things to what you wrote down. ""Maybe I'm seeing negative stuff because I'm learning about BPD and unhealthy stuff. Maybe I'm just not in a good place. Don't make big relationship-ending decisions right now..."" but the more I learned about destructive BPDmom behaviors, the more I'd catch her acting out or saying similar BPD red flags. Example: one of her guy friends got into a fight with her boyfriend. She went on a 30 minute long rant saying, ""how dare he say those things. He's so ungrateful. I'm the only reason he graduated college!"" This same person, she will defend from ridicule and will also take credit for ""teaching him to be a feminist."" Umm... you didn't make him a feminist. He decided to be one on his own. And there's no way you're solely responsible for him graduating college. Not unless you took those exams for him. Which is illegal. (Of course I never said anything)

You'll probably notice that no one in the comments will tell you whether or not you should go on the trip or whether or not you should end the friendship. Those are deeply personal decisions you have to make for yourself. You seem to care about this person, but you spend the majority of your post making excuses for them or defending them. 

I will ask you this: do you want to spend this trip with this person? Or do you feel obligated?",1518114449,"i judged her to be kind and compassionate, but in reality she would tell me how compassionate she was (by bragging) and i would take her at her word.","kind and compassionate","compassionate",NA,FALSE,"kind and compassionate","kind",NA,NA,0
"dtx960b","Clara is clearly very polarizing. If you like companions that play an important role, and are a match to the Doctor, you're probably going to like her. But if you prefer the show to be focused on the Doctor, with companions playing less important roles, you're more likely to hate her. Clara is my favourite companion, and here is what I recently wrote about why: 

She was brilliant, had a three-dimensional character and a very interesting character development. She had a great chemistry with 11 and especially with 12. She loved her adventures with the Doctor more than anyone else, but also maintained a ""normal"" life when she wasn't travelling with him. She never considered him to be a perfect, immortal, and infallible god, as so many other companions have done. She recognized his strengths, but was also fully aware of his weaknesses. She understood the way he thought and felt, and didn't just blindly accept everything he told her. She was an real help for the Doctor on countless adventures, instead of just creating problems for him solve. She was pretty much the opposite of a ""damsel in distress"". Except in Dark Water, she never asked the Doctor for help when she got into difficulties, and was always determined to solve problems on her own. I think she was a successful attempt at having a full-time companion develop to be an equal to the Doctor. Basically like Jack or River as a full-time companion, just that we also see her development, not just the final state.

She was incredibly intelligent, curious, brave, selfless and compassionate, but also vain, arrogant and needy. She was a control freak who lied and deceived others for her own benefit. A lot of the time she only cared about winning, regardless of what it would take to do so. But in my opinion, these negative character qualities just make her an even better companion, as they make her seem like a real person. Other companions either have next to no flaws at all, or have inconsistent flaws that occasionally make them seem like horrible people. 

And she had a great development from initially being quite shy and easily frightened, to being an adrenaline junkie who tried to imitate the Doctor. She's still the only character we see learn to fly the TARDIS, and we see how she becomes increasingly similar to the Doctor. For me, this solidifies the Doctor as a role model. Clara shows that even pudding-brain humans can act and think like the Doctor. It takes a lot of effort, and mistakes will be made, but the Doctor isn't an impossible ideal. 

More than any other companion, she brings out the best and worst in him. Through her adventures we see a very dark side to travelling with the Doctor. Their character similarities makes these even more apparent.

She's also the only companion to have some great speeches. And there were also so many brilliant moments that ensured her place as my favourite companion:

- The Snowmen: If it counts, her interactions with 11.
- The Bells of Saint John: Meeting the Doctor for the first time
- Cold War: ""I don't smell of anything""
- Day of the Doctor: reminding 11 of who he is supposed to be.
- Time of the Doctor: accepting her demise when attempted to be used as bait by the Daleks
- Deep Breath: her dialogue with the half-faced man

"dtvu0ju","Okay, here goes:

a) Tachyon himself, male anthropomorphic cheetah with long black hair. Is somehow related to religion, likely a priest, a personification of water deity or even a deity himself. Didn't think him through, but it's certain he lives in Egypt-like ancient civilization and wears a lot of mystical-looking bling. He's kind and compassionate, but is very poor at understanding others and can be deceived easily. So he spends most of his time alone, either within ancient temple's walls or in nature's lap.

b) Tex the lynx, survivalist and traveller, distrustful and dry. Wears camouflage cloak and wields the enchanted blade. Is fighting an unending war with the Decay, the strange force that corrupted his world and is now slowly consuming other worlds one by one, twisting them into gray and ugly wastelands full of mutated creatures - if not into endless hive-like factories mass-producing troops of Decay. Tex's got a biocomputer implanted into his left wrist which works as universal translator, so he can understand any language he encounters. He doesn't age and knows a lot of fighting and survival skills, but still he can't do much - he was touched by Decay, so whenever he enters a world untouched by it, his body starts to fall apart, so he has to get back ASAP. He believes that his ultimate mission is to destroy the Decay somehow, but he doesnt't know how yet. So he roams the endless wastelands in search of information about Decay, bands with survivors (who typically don't last for long) and occasionally travels to places targeted by Decay trying to thwart its advance. Sometimes he succeeds, sometimes not. Decay acknowledges his presence and sends its henchmen to deal with him, but it's not that easy. If Tex will manage to destroy Decay, the universe will be healed, and he will be reborn to live in a heaven-like place among others who will accept him. Until then, he is bound to fight alone.

In other words, mix up Roland Deschain, Zeratul and M'aiq the Liar, and you have Tex.

C) Fira the Hunter - not a fursona, but a character I like very much and will propably draw soon. Anthropomorphic female cheetah with bright red hair and lightning-fast reflexes. She's a hunter/programmer, member of a cheetah-like race believed to descent from the stars long ago. Her people live in underground colonies containing remains of highly advanced technologies, while the rest of her world is populated by Classical-Early Medieval age humans (and jackals, but I'm not sure about it). She excels at hunting and fighting using her scimitar, can also write programs for ancient computers (out of necessity, doesn't like it much), but gets tired extremely fast - like everyone of her kind. She's a badass fighter and companion but is prone to excessive soul-searching which often leaves her doubting if the case she's fighting for is right.

She's my mixture between Bagheera's [Jowana](http://www.furaffinity.net/full/678158/), RogueKitty's [Rogue](http://www.furaffinity.net/full/12291693/) and Selker's [Sira](http://www.furaffinity.net/full/701930/).

"dtt0wc4","Not shocking at all- many, many years ago I was subpoenaed to testify in federal court on a relatively mundane matter of bankruptcy fraud by an employer...I was the eyewitness who was able to corroborate the documents that got him busted, since I had created some of them on his orders while working in his office...thankfully a good friend had told me to report the guy to the local DA for other fraud my boss was involved in before I quit, which was what shut down the  guy's defense attorney when he tried to claim that I was really just a co-conspirator trying to save my own ass by cooperating with the government.

Anyway, the prosecutors were all happy and we all went our separate ways...

about a year later I get a call on my automated answering service from my old boss who I understandably had been avoiding...in very graphic details he outlined how he remembered what I had done, was armed at all times, and said that if he ever saw me again he would shoot me dead. 

It was all recorded, the guy had a criminal history besides the case I was involved with and I took him at his word. I figured that he'd made a really bad mistake, seeing as how he was threatening me for testifying against him in federal court.

When I contacted the federal prosecutors whose case it had been, they literally laughed at me and refused to do anything, said I was being overly dramatic, this kind of thing happens all the time and what did I expect, since I had helped ruin his life? 

To this day it's the most callous attitude I've ever experienced directed towards me, there was ZERO concern or empathy and they made it crystal clear that they couldn't care less and would not lift a finger unless and until I had actually been shot. 

When I pushed them harder about asking citizens for help and then leaving them twisting in the wind once they'd gotten what they wanted,  they made up some bullshit about how since the death threats were left on an automated answering service it wan't really a threat *to me* but to a machine, and ""we can't do anything about it because it isn't illegal to threaten a machine"".

Obviously the scenarios is different - the Jews were ultimately being killed (although it's debatable how much the German people knew this would be their fate). But they were just following the law. But laws are human constructs and may not be universally ""good"". There are loads of shit laws. More worryingly, I thought MAGA was all about self-empowerment.

&gt; 
&gt; Patrolmen’s Benevolent Association boss Pat Lynch slashed the maximum number of cards that could be issued to current cops from 30 to 20, and to retirees from 20 to 10, sources told The Post.

Other posters have good advice, keep it short and succinct, empathetic and compassionate but you must stay firm and not budge with what you want for yourself (in the long run, ie., a healthy relationship with a healthy, responsible person). 

After just having been through this, here is what I think works. Get out while it's still relatively calm and take the first opportunity to do so. Don't hang in there until the roof collapses on you because it absolutely will. Don't try to fix their feelings, just accept that it sucks and that is that. You'll get over it and so will they, and you're not responsible for how they feel. 

I was lucky, she told me not to contact her and I left it at that. OK! I deleted her off my phone. We've had a history of on and off. She may have been acting impulsively, but that's not my problem. 

All of these replies here are spot on. Really great advice. It's not pleasant at all, but it has to be done. There is no middle ground with BPDs.

Good luck to you, take really good care of yourself, stay rational and empathetic to yourself and please keep us updated if you need support. I am going to meditate, hang out with friends and be patient with myself.

UPDATE: (Day after) My ex just threatened to kill herself and this forced me to call the police and go NC. I feel all kinds of worry, guilt, concern, and fear. Everything said in this thread regarding moving on quickly, calmly and quietly is REALLY GOOD ADVICE. Get off the water before the storm hits, because it absolutely well. Don't play with fire and expect not to get burned. Fire can burn your house down. You have been warned. Leave quietly and don't be involved with people like this.

"dsywt9y","Not sure, but I see a pattern for my own story. You might have read those stories here too: (Disclaimer, I'm not trying to appropriate those testimonies, and that it applies to me doesn't mean it applies to you.)

I've seen someone whose Nparents went to social services alleging abuse on the grandchildren as a means to get back at their daughter because she tried to have a restraining order on her mom who broke and entered the victim's house. (My mother had me institutionalised because I crossed her and called her toxic).

I've seen another member have the police come check her for a suicidal risk call from their Nparent just so the N could make contact again. (I wouldn't pick up on my mother's calls, but one night I called back to demand that she would appologise for her behaviour, and then unbeknownst to me she called 911 - I learned about this because the staff at the hospital where my mother did manage to have me locked up 9 months later used that particular story as precedent of mental distress, the latter which never existed).

I've seen a young lady have her mother make it so her social worker would disappear on the girl, and forbade the girl to see her therapist. (My mother went around to have my unemployment cheques cancelled and nobody doubted her).

You are in danger. It's not just that ""mom is a mean bitch"". Your mom is a full-on MONSTER and WILL hurt you BAD if you don't keep her the fuck off you.

Anyone under the influence of a narc is in danger. You might not even know all the ways she's been trying to hurt you behind your back or profit from you.

Yours is now a poor poor widow. You are 35 and cannot hold your own while being unemployed (welcome to the club, not criticizing, I know us late X gen get paid like shit). You are an easy target. There's already a history of physical threats. Your family member are against you. Next, she will allege that YOU mistreated her.

Ask yourself. Did you lose your job, or quit your job ? Did you yearn to be accepted back by your mother ? Did you try, prior to that, to go NC - seems like you did. Did you feel like she finally understood your plight, and it was an occasion to mend bridges ? Did she encourage you to quit your job but had been ambivalent about it before (like did you have to explain how you needed it because she seemed reluctant?) Is she never answering yes or no, but is always eluding the questions, then yelling that you have a problem ?

Do all conversations that you have about serious or practical stuff end up with you angered and shaking or on the verge of tears and frustrated and the problem cemented as the status quo ? Is she trying to preserve hurdles and problems and make them worse for you ? Like you wanted to throw out a bunch of all laundry but they end up from the trash on the street back into your room scattered on the floor ? Does she try to impede your progress in every way possible by calling your attention, being physically in the way everywhere you turn ? Have you started losing your keys more since you moved back but you suspect it's not because the house is so much bigger than your own ?

"dsyn3pk","Aw, I'm sorry you're feeling down on yourself. That's the one of the worst feelings in the world. 

You know, you're definitely not alone. MANY people, including me, have felt self-loathing at some point in their lives. It's a dark and lonely punishment very few have earned . . .

It's ridiculous how hard we can be ourselves, while we endlessly forgive others for their fallibilities, we magnify our own imperfections, thinking others are judging us just as harshly when in reality nothing could be further from the truth! 

I'm older now, and much better at course correcting inner dialogue toward even-handed self-assessments. For the most part, I really enjoy my own company, and it seems most others do as well. (I wish I felt the same. LOL) I do love to make people laugh, or at the very least, give them reason to smile if I can.

So . . . why do you hate yourself? Whatever your reasons, ask yourself: Are you being fair to yourself?  Would you judge others so harshly? If not, why are you kicking yourself when you obviously need hugs and affirmations? What do you like about yourself? What do you think other people like about you, or would like if they knew you?

"dsx38r6","I recommend creative denial.

Whenever that feeling comes up, give it a voice- let it speak for a while. That alone will help, a little bit.

Let it speak for a while until it becomes clear and you feel you have heard it. Maybe it will say something like ""That person has something good and I don't! I hate her!!!""

This isn't you talking per se- this is that emotion of yours. We are all made up of lots and lots of different aspects, and you can actually have a little conversation with yourself, or with one of those aspects. It may be a bit unusual at first but talking to yourself works wonders in order to get back in charge of behavior you can't seem to control.

So you let that voice speak, like you would let an upset toddler cry. ""I hate that person!!! Why isn't it *me* who received those wonderful things???""

Then, as yourself, you say: ""No you don't. You're really happy for that person's success and luck."" Say it several times. You can also directly command yourself. ""Be happy for that person. Be happy for that person."" Use a warm, friendly, compassionate, but very firm tone- like a really good dog trainer or a friendly old grandfather.

Most likely that inner jealousy voice will pop right back- but that doesn't matter. This is not like waving a magic wand. This is like digging a hole with a shovel. Be persistent. *Every time* you hear that jealousy voice, contradict it and correct it several times. ""No you don't with that person were dead. You wish that person well and hard happy for them. Yes you are. Really happy for them. You are so happy for them. Be happy.""

Do this every day, and especially whenever the feeling comes up. Keep going until your jealously is at a level you can deal with, or even take it further to reduce it below average. Then take it up a notch and praise people's successes without being prompted: Oh that's so wonderful that Jessica won first prize in her literature contest and got a $10000 stiped. It will be so nice what she can buy with that, I know how much she wanted to go to South America. She'll be so happy here! Good for her! I'm going to call her and tell her how glad I am.""

In short- your jealously is just a habit, and you can change any habit whatsoever if you are persistent at it. Enjoy! I hope this helps.

"dsvq3z9","I'm a SF native with deep roots there - My blood runs orange and black (though no longer red &amp; gold) with some fog and Anchor Steam for good measure. I own properties there and still spend ~15% of my time there. 

I made a conscious choice to move my family to Sac over 15 years ago and it's (mostly) been fantastic. Sac gets better every year while SF is turning into a Disneyland for the rich. In terms of livability for ""normal"" people, there's no comparison - Sac wins **hands down**! The food scene is excellent, local music and arts are good, and they're all getting better. A huge one for me is that traffic here is an absolute ***DREAM*** compared to the Bay - A few months ago, I met up with a buddy at [The Saloon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Saloon) in North Beach. He was coming from Mountain View, we left at roughly the same time, yet I was finishing my first drink when he finally got there. His mortgage is over $7K/month (and he's killing himself to pay it) while my home is paid in full. The weather - Yeah, it's better in the Bay, but the Bay has one of the best climates on the planet. Sac weather is fantastic compared to almost everywhere except the Bay. Sure, it roasts for a few months in the summer, but everyone has AC. And the body absolutely does adapt (took me a couple of years tho).

It's all about life choices, plus the fact that we ALL intrinsically try to justify ours. I straddle the line between the SF tribe and the Sac tribe and see the many merits of both.

Kirk is really interesting as a character and as an imprint on our culture. Kirk as he was in the show is only tangentially related to the Zapp Brannigan parody people remember him as. Kirk in the show is more subtle, contemplative, restrained and compassionate - but I don't actually think he's a super memorable character. Each episode of TOS acted as a thought experiment.

"dspannw","There’s a sticky patch on the side of my seat. Just next to my right leg, where it’d be comfortable for me to rest my hand. Doesn’t matter how I try and sit, I keep forgetting about it; my hand just keeps naturally resting in it. *Juice, maybe. Or cola. Probably cola,* I think to myself, *juice wouldn’t be that shade of brown.*

The subway car is a mess. Litter is strewn everywhere; bottles and cans skitter across the floor every time the train begins the long, slow grind into the next station. There just weren’t enough sanitation workers any more. Utes, they called them. Utilitarian jobs. Lifetime of that kind of work puts you up a notch; ute worker generally lands you somewhere around a transport officer or a communications worker. Government hadn’t thought it through at first. Pretty unfortunate, really. Couple of generations back the Ministerial Office of Reincarnations had offered a sweet deal for blue collar workers, saying if you spent a lifetime as a janitor or a sanitation worker, they’d put you up at least two bands. Then the IB68 flu hits, kills two million. Mostly poor ones, the kind who work with their hands a lot. All of a sudden they’ve got huge backlogs. Hundreds of thousands of minds in Limbo, not enough babies being born to fill.

Even after they’d waited their turn and they finally got imprinted on a newborn, by the time they’d all hit working age we had three-hundred thousand people who’d been promised middle class jobs and there just wasn’t anything to do. They started giving them choices. You can go up, they said, get a nice job in a big office, but then be in lifedebt. Or slog out another lifetime as a ute, hoping it’d balance out in a generation or two and you’d be able to take up that cushy office worker position you’d been hoping for these last two or three reinc’s.

Guess it could be juice. Apple, or grape. The car begins to slow. My stop is coming up.

Surprise surprise, people weren’t keen on the idea of missing out on a nicer life, so most of them went up, took the lifedebt. They had a nice time, nice office, nice spouse, nice kids. Died comfortably. Then, though, the debt was due, and a lifetime is a big commitment. Having such a nice life just made it harder to go back to the shitty lives, having to work at your own expense for the betterment of the world around you. Sometimes people refused to work, refused to play the game. They’d protest, end up getting themselves life sentences.

Some of ‘em went even further than that. Didn’t like the sound of that or jail, so they offed themselves. Killing yourself meant you went back into Limbo, back into the queue, back into a newborn. You got to be a kid again, right up until you were old enough to do the job you were meant to do. Costs a lot to keep a kid alive until they can work. Government decided it was way too expensive to keep raising reinc’s who just didn’t want to repay the lifedebt. Can’t have that. Used the predictive algorithm to track them in Limbo, eventually it’d lead you to a freshly imprinted newborn. 

“Now arriving at: Central Hospital.”

A half-finished bottle of cola rolls across the subway car, spilling its contents all over the floor.

That’s where I come in.

The imprint was in Room 16A. Halfway up, nice view. Stepping into the elevator, I keep rehearsing the speech in my head. Compassionate, but firm. Some parents took it better than others, it was just luck. This case is a lesbian couple, IVF pregnancy. Tends to make it worse, artificial pregnancy parents always took the news harder. 

As I step into the room, both of them are asleep. I rap a knuckle against the doorframe as I step in. The mother doesn’t wake up, but the partner opens her eyes, sleepily regarding the intruder disturbing their hard-earned rest.

‘Morning ma’am, I’m Officer Endsley, I’m with the MOR. Are you the partner? Ms…’ I pause and look down at my notes, ‘Ms. Brown?’

Something changes about her demeanour. She closes her eyes again, her brow furrows. She inhales, slowly. Exhales. Inhales again as she finally makes eye contact.

‘Tell me it’s not in lifedebt.’

I smile sympathetically. Dodge the question. She can tell.

‘I’m sorry ma’am but I need you to confirm your identity.’

‘Of course you fucking do. Yes, I’m Megan Brown. Is it in lifedebt?’

‘Thank you ma’am, and yes, it is.’

She throws her hands up and scoffs. ‘Great. Great. What a waste of fucking time.’

The mother wakes up at the noise.

‘Morning ma’am, I-‘ I begin.

‘It’s in fucking lifedebt, Susan. Another one.’ The partner stands up, interrupting my platitude. She walks over to the window, her hands on her hips.

The mother sits up, blinking. ‘You’re kidding’

I try again. ‘Morning ma’am. I presume you’re Susan Brown, the mother?’

Susan rubs her forehead. ‘Yep, that’s me.’

I decide to change tact.

‘I presume, then that you’re both… familiar with this situation?’

The partner turns back. ‘You catch on quick!’ she says with a frustrated half-laugh.

The mother stares at me. ‘You know-‘ the partner begins, but the mother interrupts her.

‘Are you sure?’ she asks coldly. I not. She sighs. Small shake of the head.

‘Get out.’

I think of expressing my condolences, but I’ve done this often enough to know they don’t want to hear it. They had newborn insurance, they’d be compensated. Bad luck, having two imprints in a row in lifedebt. Ministry was working on deployment of a program that could hold lifedebt minds in Limbo long-term, but they hadn’t rolled it out yet. 

Must be hard to lose a kid.


In the neonatal rooms, I show the nurse my ID, give her the papers. She leads me through a grid of cots, shows me the newborn. Start going through the procedure. Scan the chip, make sure it matches the imprint number. Next to the ID are the letters ‘LD’. Lifedebt. Yep, this was the one. Guy had been a 27 year old sewer ute before he decided he’d had enough, wanted to be a kid again, didn’t want that life for another half a century. Jumped off a bridge. They say that doesn’t kill you fast, it just breaks your body. They say you drown in agony.

I take a small syringe out of my pocket.

Backup consciousnesses didn’t get uploaded to Limbo until kids were 5. Before then, all the neurons were too messy. Scans weren’t reliable, the copies got all messed up. If you died before you were 5, boom, that was it. You were gone, nothing the MOR could do.

I stick the syringe into the IV line already in the newborn’s arm. 

For that five year window, the consciousnesses were off the grid. No backups, no second chances. Maybe this guy knew that, maybe not. Maybe he figured it was better than a lifetime of hard work. Hopefully he knew it. *Does it make a difference if he knew it?*

I pushed the plunger in until the syringe was empty. After the pulse was gone, I waited for a couple of minutes, long enough to be sure of braindeath.

Please be very certain about this; No matter how much interaction you’ve had before leaving and no matter what or how you feel NOTHING IS REAL UNTIL YOU MEET HER IN PERSON.

If her parents agree for her to stay with you just run,  that’s far too liberal for it to end well.  Parents just won’t allow it.

It’s possible she’ll lie to the to have the chance to stay with you but that’s not necessarily a bad lie.

Going to be honest with you here...  don’t build up in your mind that she’s a sweet innocent “nearly a virgin”.  Filipinas have natural urges,  many like sex,  some LOVE sex, she’s probably had boyfriends and it’s almost guaranteed any sexual encounters have been hidden from everyone she knows.  They are expert at secret liaisons but that’s because of the social pressure to be pure.

You can have sex with her,  it’s ok,  she’s unlikely to be an untouched virgin but of course if you’re aiming for a relationship treat her nicely (but don’t spoil her).  If she was a naughty girl you should still treat her nicely but don’t let your emotions (and urges) take over.

If you intend marrying her eventually the best way to reduce your risk is spending LOTS of time with her face to face.  This can be one or two LONG trips (months in duration) or many shorter trips...  but you need face to face time together.  Skype and other online contact does not count for real contact time.

Don’t listen to anyone that warns you about “marrying the whole family” and “families being parasites”.  I’ve not read the comments above but that usually comes up.  The Filipino family structure is different and they all help each other.  If you marry a filipina you become a part of her family and you should happily help out when you can - and if you can’t or won’t help out then fine,  it’s easy - don’t marry a filipina.

If you do marry a filipina and you’ve been careful with not letting your dick do the thinking then sir,  you are in for a blessed life.

And you need to understand that dollars aren't worth the same everywhere. They're less valuable in CA due to inflation. That's why gas is $4/gal there and housing is so expensive. They also have crazy high SALT. So if you raise the minimum wage for a worker there to $15 when it's $7.50 in Texas, you're giving them more dollars but not more value.

"ds4clie","Not offended, per se, as you are still in the learning and drafting stage and you are seeking feedback; that’s light years ahead of many.  I am just jarred and left off put.

&gt; Out of interest, was it the lack of context that made the scene distasteful or just the scene in and of itself

If I have to boil my response down that binary, then I choose “just the scene in and of itself,” though that is minimizing the intricacy of the issue. Really there isn’t a way to make sexual brutality “enjoyable” to read to the average consumer, rather only palatable and/or of literary merit (this statement does not include acts like *consensual* bondage/knifeplay/breathplay/ect.).  This is a large reason I made the recommendations I did, as many of them have borderline or flat out despicable/distasteful sexual interactions in them, but the way in which they are handled renders the “bad taste” part of a larger tableau that would be lacking sorely if the sex act were cut.  Context alone, however, does not equal this tableau.

For (a non-sexual) example, let’s say a story opens with a character shooting dogs.  That is, for Western audiences, a very low and almost unforgivable act.  But how about with context?  The man is shooting stray dogs in India.  People will still balk.  People won’t get why India is relevant.  The story still opens with a man shooting dogs and no American is going to like that even though this is taking place in a foreign country.  (In your case, this is you saying “the MC’s mother made him rape/brutalize that girl.”)  In order for the context to matter, *it must be attached to a plot that has already been established*.  Going back to the dog example, if the story opens with an Indian child getting bitten by a rabid dog, maybe a scene with some humanitarian group helping dog-bite victims with dialogue about how [36% of the GLOBAL deaths from rabies occur in India, happen to children, and are almost always the result of dog-bites]( http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/87/12/09-021209/en/), and  **then** we get the scene where the MC is introduced gunning down dogs the reader is willing to listen *because the dangerous framework of the plot (rabies, in this case) has already been established*.  Now the dog-shooting scene is the act of a hero, not some freakish a**hole.

**How This ramble Relates to Your Book:**

The human brain gives extreme weight to first impressions, basically defining new experiences, places, and people by that first blast of information.  This is called [primacy]( http://psychology.iresearchnet.com/social-psychology/social-cognition/primacy-effect-in-attribution/) and, in a nutshell, means the first impression of a person (or a book) is the lasting impression *even if conflicting information is presented*.  Look at what our first glimpse of (presumably) your MC is: brutally screwing a girl whose name he doesn’t know, smashing her head into the floor hard enough to crack it.  Are you planning on him being a noble, gentle, upstanding man?  A person we idolize?  Too bad.  [Primacy]( http://psychology.iresearchnet.com/social-psychology/social-cognition/primacy-effect-in-attribution/) says he is a sexually abusive monster and our social scripts for “hero” do not overlap with that.

Now, primacy can be used in your favor if you want your noble hero to have committed a horrible sex crime.  Look at [Tyrion Lannister]( http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Tyrion_Lannister).  Most would initially balk when I suggested him as an example.  We as an audience think of him a noble, a bit tragic, and compassionate, but the bastard gang-banged his wife with an entire army, then he tossed her coin like a common whore and never spoke to her again.  So why do we still look up to him?  Because his introduction painted him in a positive light and the human brain doesn’t like having its initial assumptions proven wrong.

**TL:DR version:**
First impressions count, especially in books.  Make sure you are making the right one.",1514967658,"we as an audience think of him a noble, a bit tragic, and compassionate, but the bastard gang-banged his wife with an entire army, then he tossed her coin like a common whore and never spoke to her again.","tragic, and compassionate","compassionate",NA,TRUE,"tragic , and compassionate","tragic",NA,NA,0
"ds31djw","First thing's first- if you are not happy with your life, recognize that you have to *work* to make it change.  People have inertia, and as you get older, that inertia slows down (less entergy to do stuff, time goes by faster, bodies fall apart, etc).  You have to *actively* combat this, plus whatever mental/physical health issues you might have that get in the way (as best you can; that shit is hard)..  You don't have to be on the ball all the time and it's certainly ok to chill and relax at times, but commit yourself to self-improvement.  Life only gets worse if you don't.  

Secondly: recognize that it's not going to be easy.  Nothing worth doing is.

* Don't coast through life anymore- it's time to build yourself up.  Take responsibility for yourself and move forward.  Find balance and calmness in that forward momentum.  Don't resign to simply being an observer.  
* Read more.  Learn about interesting stuff.  You don't have to dig into it too far, but staying on top of recent events is good.  Learn about how people's brains (esp. their emotional subconscious) works.
* Stay current with the news, and learn about *why* people are often upset about current issues.  Remember, things that are ""just politics"" to you are incredibly personal to others.  Keep that in mind before you start badmouthing anyone, too.
* With that in mind, don't put others down to make yourself seem better.  We're all doing our best here, so be positive and encouraging.  Be someone others want around.  **Don't be selfish.**
* Have a variety of hobbies that you can share.  Shared interests are good way to connect to people (and a good ice breaker).  Kicking butt at Call of Duty isn't something you can share easily with others.
* Learn how to communicate nonverbally (and how to read others' body language).  A **lot** of communication can be carried along with things like posture, tone, inflection, hand gestures, and so on, and the better you can present yourself, the more effective you'll be.  Word choice is fucking critical here, and again, do your best to be positive.  This is surprisingly important.
* Have a better opinion of yourself.  There's no ""wrong end of your 20s"".  You're still young, dude.  Remember though: wisdom only comes with age if you work for it.  ""Late 20s-early 30s"" is when most people really start getting their shit together as an individual.
* Address those mental health, self esteem issues, and fears.  
* Have interesting life experiences to share.  No, this doesn't mean put yourself in danger, it means work to improve yourself and your surroundings.
* Be fun. Make others laugh.
* Everything is a skill, and skills get better at practice.  Sure things come easier to some more than others, but so what.  Study and practice will absolutely overcome untrained talent alone.
* Confidence comes with growth and practice.  There's no magic trick to it.  Study and practice.  When you make mistakes (which you will), work to understand it and learn from the situation, so you don't repeat it.  Ideally you can learn from the mistakes of others.
* If you want a specific type of person in your life, look to see the kind of people they want in their lives.  Recognize how to be a positive influence, and learn how to deal with negative influences (avoid them).  
* Meeting people is just a matter of networking.  The more you get out there, the more opportunities you will have.
* Recognize your strengths.  Not just personal ones that you cultivated, but societal ones as well (for example, white, male, heterosexual, living in a first-world country, etc).  Understand how those things affect your outlook on life, and work to understand the lives of those who don't have those things.  Cultivate empathy and understanding, and again, learn what it takes to be properly supportive.  
* Learn to stand up for yourself.  This doesn't mean be an asshole, but it's ok to have reasonable standards.  Be supportive, but don't be a doormat.  Be empathetic and compassionate, but don't tolerate toxic people or coddle dangerous mindsets.  Know where to draw the line, and more importantly, *how* to draw the line.
* Be forgiving as best as you see fit, especially for small stuff.  We're all doing our best, and everyone makes mistakes.  This includes forgiving yourself, too.
* Develop good emotional communication skills.  This is for connecting to others, but also for communicating with yourself.

* And most importantly- **Get out and talk to people.**  That's how you practice social skills, network for new jobs, and make new friends.  Staying home on the internet only gets you so far in life.

Everyone exists in a world independent of you... unless you make yourself someone they want to include.  That's how life is.  Everyone is the hero of their own story- you can either be another hero to them, a strong and supportive ally, or a *nobody.*  Don't be ""an enemy"" either- that's just lame.

Han *was* against sending him away (Ohtze doesn't seem to know about this). Rey is protective and compassionate, but not nurturing, and Kylo doesn't want nurture from her. He offered to teach her as her superior and then to accept her as his equal; he is not submissive towards her, just gentle.

Pointing at the bridal carry and saying 'this is an obvious and intentional trope that we all understand and it means something about these characters' was completely valid, but saying this idea of Usurper/Holy Mother is something on that level is begging the question. I've never heard of that version of Mordred and Oedipus isn't a good parallel at all (it is literal and it is a tragedy)- where are the examples of this in pop culture?

The parallel to Anakin/Padme is definitely intentional, but that doesn't make it the same relationship. The entire reason it has the potential to be the healthy and restorative version of that tragedy is that Ben and Rey are *equals* where Padme and Anakin were not.

"drxca3j","I mean... It's not just about what they could say to you, it's about talking about these issues with someone who is compassionate but also objective and knowledgeable. Everyone could use some therapy to deal with life stressors, and if you've never really had it, I recommend it. 

The therapist doesn't have to solve your problems... If you're managing your own mental health, they can be kind of a consultant. I have a PhD in psychology, so there isn't much a therapist could tell me that I don't already know. I'm probably more qualified to make an exposure therapy routine for myself than most therapists, but I'm not necessarily able to make myself follow through with it. 

That being said, it's so helpful to talk to someone, and if you have a mental health problem that needs specific treatment (CBT, DBT, medication, etc.), they can help you get that if they are not qualified. 

Also, if you have codependency problems, talking to a therapist about your issues puts less of a burden on your friends. We all need to process things with other people, but if you just have so much to process, it's really not fair to load it on to other people. That being said, if you think you may have some of the characteristics of BPD, then you might as well look for a therapist that can do DBT, which you may know is a treatment for BDP that has also been shown to be helpful for depression and other issues.

Saying you don't need a therapist is like saying you don't need a doctor because you know what illnesses you may have because you read WebMD and go on reddit. The fact that you are well read makes you a better patient, because you can advocate for yourself and ask questions.

From [SSC Endorses Clinton, Johnson, or Stein](http://slatestarcodex.com/2016/09/28/ssc-endorses-clinton-johnson-or-stein/):

&gt; A commenter on here the other day quoted an Atlantic article complaining that “The press takes [Trump] literally, but not seriously; his supporters take him seriously, but not literally”. Well, count me in that second group. I don’t think he’s literal. I think when he talks about building a wall and keeping out Muslims, he’s metaphorically saying “I’m going to fight for you, the real Americans”. When he talks about tariffs and trade deals, he’s metaphorically saying “I’m going to fight for you, the real Americans”.

Let's see, what policies has he done? Pursued funding for the wall, a Muslim ban, and killed the TPP.

&gt; I’ve never been fully comfortable with the Left because I feel like they often make the same error – the only reason there’s still poverty is because the corporate-run government is full of traitors who refuse to make the completely great, no-downsides policy of raising the minimum wage. **One of the right’s great redeeming feature has been an awareness of these kinds of tradeoffs.**

It would work great, but I'm not good enough with writing to fit it in with the way the scenes play out.

It makes most sense for that ""vision"" to play in front of the viewer BEFORE Luke draws his saber. This is crucial. If he has it drawn before the vision, then he looks like a preemptive murderer. 

Here's the issue. 

In Luke's first account of the memory, he doesn't ever draw his saber because he is lying about what happened. If they include the ""Ben being crazy in the future"" vision here, then viewers will question why Luke never drew his light saber  

If they wait to include the vision during Luke's honest retelling of the memory, and have him draw his saber after we witness the vision, we will wonder why Luke didn't tell us about this vision during his biased, lying version of events.

Do you see what I mean? It doesn't make sense for him to include the vision the first time because him drawing his saber HAS to be after we see the vision. 

The only way I see it working is if the ""vision"" is shown twice as well. Once (during Luke's lie) with Luke seeing the vision and then acting super compassionate but Kylo turns on him anyways. 

The next time Luke tells the story (his honest version), Luke sees the vision and then draws his saber.

Well, do you want to?

If you're someone who has invested in the old LaVeyan notions of self-interest, this is really a deceptively simple question to answer: If it makes you happy to do something for someone, that's a perfectly good reason to do it. Other people might have opinions about whether your generosity is wise or warranted under the circumstances, but the great thing about other people's opinions is that they can stick them wherever they want and you don't have to mind it a bit.

You can also make any number of social arguments about the more material dividends of giving, in terms of game theory and reciprocity and the residual benefits of general social welfare, etc. I'll be honest, I don't think I have the head for that kind of thing, but I will say it's a fair bet that, given their druthers, very few people would choose to live in some of the most impoverished countries in the world even if they themselves could maintain their present level of economic advantage, because, not coincidentally, those tend to be fundamentally worse environments. 

Finally, since you used the word ""compassion,"" most people have probably heard the first fundamental tenet of the Satanic Temple:

&gt;One should strive to act with compassion and empathy towards all creatures in accordance with reason.

Most people seem to interpret this as ""We should be nice and kind to everybody"" or some variation of that but notice that it doesn't actually say that.

"drge9fw","Hi! I hope I can help.

Everyone is different with their EDs. Personally, when I went vegan because of animal activism it helped me recover a great deal. It made me compassionate, but most of all, eating became about saving another thing's life and avoiding that food was therapeutic for this reason. It 1. Gave me a purpose and 2. Made me a lot less self absorbed and obsessive about myself.

Now, there ARE so so many ED men and women that use claims of veganism to avoid eating at family meals, when going out etc. It really depends why she is going vegan. If it's ethical and not health related, if she is honest with herself AND everyone else, it could be a good thing.

What documentaries did she see? Was it ""fat, sick, and nearly dead"", ""what the health"" or ""forks over knives""? As a [real whole life including clothes and cosmetics, etc] vegan, I consider these documentaries to be fallacious and encourage fear based eating (you will get cancer, you will die, you will get fat).

If the docs were Earthlings, Vegucated, or Cowspiracy, that is a very very different motivator and there's almost no chance it's about diet. I know even if her intentions are good, she IS putting her self at risk, but she has a full medical team and she can probably do this transition safely if she keeps it up.

"dr1qydb","&gt; An economic and political system in which a country's trade and industry are controlled by private owners for profit.

So profit is somehow evil in your eyes? Profit is simply the amount of value you have created between the input and the output. Jesus bought raw wood the input and sold furniture as the output. The difference between the price of the raw wood and the price of the  finished furniture is profit.

Also, there is no difference between profit and trade. People only trade because it's profitable to do so. They trade to make a profit. Thus my definition seems to hold. Capitalism requires no other thing than the right to own and trade property. Everything else follows naturally from those two simple principles.

&gt;Wealth accumulation = hoarding of wealth in such a way as to take more than you need from the poor.

I can guarantee with a 100% certainty that you have more property than you need for basic survival. You are thus guilty of wealth accumulation. The fact that you are able to spend time on Reddit probably puts you in the wealthiest 5% in the world.

&gt;Capitalism usually extends the definition of 'private' to corporations and organizations that aren't personal, familial, or individual. 

Corporations are by no means necessary for capitalism. They can be useful, but they are not necessary. All that is needed for capitalism is the right to own and trade property.

&gt;Those are two principles that contrast with Christian dogma in a fundamental way.

Again, I'm waiting for you to give me a plausible explanation of how Jesus would have professed his profession without trade or competitive economics.

&gt;Free trade implies that there ought be no personal limitations on how we trade in an economy

There should be personal limitations, for example you should be honest and reliable and compassionate. But there should not be limitations to trade created by corrupt politicians working for their lobbyists and the corporations funding them.

&gt;Capitalism's 'help' of the poor is incidental, at best.

It's incredibly consistent. It seems to happen every single time when free market principles are introduced. Compare West and East Germany or South and North Korea. See what happened in China after the horrible dark veil of communism was lifted and China opened up for trade: millions and millions of people escaping poverty.

&gt;tell me that it taught anything of what you are preaching

I'm preaching giving from what is yours. You are preaching giving from what belongs to others.

&gt;automation

What could you possibly have against automation?

&gt;wage labor

Funny that you mention that, Jesus had many parables in which God was equated to an employer or capitalist: either renting land and collecting a profit from it or having people perform wage labor to Him. He even seemed to encourage interest when He told the lazy servant that he should have collected interest in a bank for his talent instead of burying it in the ground. 

&gt;There is no biblical, patristic, or theological way to defend Capitalism in our tradition.

"dr1d26r","Okay, coming from me, you may have to take some of this with a giant grain of salt- or it might be relatable. I’ll explain.  I have hidden my entire addiction and recovery debacle from everyone except my SO, and my immediate recovery community. I hide it from family, friends, coworkers, acquaintances ... everyone. For about 12 years now. And with a habit the size I had, this took a LOT of work. I have not been “honest” in the traditional sense.

Why have I done this? And more importantly how does it make me feel? I think I did it initially because I was ashamed. Embarrassed. I was raised to do the right thing and I knew I was not doing the right thing and have been horrified with myself. It’s a bitter pill for me to swallow (pun, sorry). This was early on - as my addiction took its course I didn’t care how I felt about.  Now as I recover, it just makes me sad. At this point I don’t feel like I have much choice in continuing to hide this. My parents are older, and laying this on them would be cruel and unnecessary. My kids are old enough that knowing this about me would be incredibly confusing and disrupt their lives. I worked way too hard to give them normal lives to sacrifice that. My colleagues would lose all respect for me. Stigma is a fact. Some may be compassionate but most would feel angry and betrayed. Same deal with friends- some would stay, some would go. I’m just not in the mood to be judged by others.

It sucks that I can’t be “honest with everyone” but I feel it would be more destructive than beneficial to my life and the lives of those that would be affected.  I’m accountable to myself, my SO, my recovery community and my higher power.

And by higher power I do not mean “God”- I’m an atheist as well, maybe one with agnostic moments.

I don’t believe in any kind of organized religion concept of God. I believe there’s some kind of energy force that flows through everything, after all energy has to go somewhere. 
“God” is everywhere around us, in the trees, in the sun, the earth, the streets, other people. I think human beings can be either more or less connected to that force. I feel most spiritual when I’m outside, in wild places- the mountains or ocean, forests and fields. Even looking at something amazing, or experiencing something incredible. Being connected to a “spiritual” or energy flow helps me connect more to myself and others.  God this sounds woo-woo, sorry, but I’ll keep trying to explain without sounding like a cultist...

You know that connection feeling that happens at a big concert sometimes? Or a sports event? Where it turns into this huge shared feeling? Or on a micro level, the energy you feel when you’re around someone and you both either really like or really hate each other. It’s different, right? When I say “spirituality” I mean getting back to a place of existence that relates me to other people to the world I live in - to each other, and in a way that is fulfilling to me. And has a postitive impact outward. I want to live a good life, and to do that, all those things need to reconnect and reconcile. How I achieve that is by spiritual work. Whether that be meditation, through my actions, my thought, my time spent with others, time outside. It’s mindfulness. Time spent bettering myself as a human.

I think the ""inborn thing I can't help"" narrative is a lie.

I know people like to be compassionate, but I think compassion for the children who could be affected by this stuff is more important here, and compassion for why they might lie about it and what's actually going on is important too.

check out the link I left earlier on the thread about a pedophile who left a comment right in line with this whole ""virtuous"" thing, and follow the comment thread to where he chooses to mention a specific child actor he wants to boff, and says he ""probably has different ideas than most people"" about why it's a bad idea to approach children (implying legal vs. harm they kids would come to.)

"dqz4fsx","E10DIN does not know the actual nature of her behavior. They have speculated that it's abusive though the words used by the OP are too vague to envision the actual behavior of his wife beyond knowing that she is expressing anger. 

That subject aside, there has been an injustice commited against women that has negativel impacted women's health and that is the weaponization of female health issues. Doctors of the early periods of modern medicine were not incorrect to note that there was a connection between hormones and the brain, and that hormones had something to do with some mental health issues they would sometimes see in female patients. 

However these things were poorly understood and the patriarchal establishment was quick to seize on the science of the day and take it out of context to use as a weapon against women in their fight for equality. Health problems that affect a minority of women were spun in to something taken to be an intrinsic aspect of all women to invalidate and oppress women.

The resulting push back of this during the woman's rights movement resulted in a climate where acknowledging and thus investigating these medical conditions and their impact on the quality of lives of women became taboo, and women suffering from these completely treatable issues were instead pegged as acting and feeling like normal women (perpetuating negative stereotypes against women) or passed off to psychiatrists and psychologist where they were drugged with medications or given talk therapy that didn't address the problem. 

These women often have physical synptoms as well, such as abnormal or heavy bleeding during and between periods, extremely painful periods, chronic migraines and general malaise, and are often told this is a normal part of womanhood and have to suffer with it when that is not true, or have been given hysterectomies by doctors who were compassionate but unaware there were other ways to treat the problem, or were afraid to mention hormones due to fears of being accused of sexism. So they take her woman parts out intead and then they can safely say, ""now you have to take hormones to prevent osteoporosis"". Though more recently doctors have been prescribing the somehow more socially acceptable birth control pills...in fact half of the women who take birth control pills do so to treat hormone problems from endonetriosis and other conditions.

But these pills are primarily designed for birth control and may contain non ideal synthetic hormones or hormone ratios, and are packaged ad birth control.

Because of the stigma and fear surrounding the subject of hormone problems in woman, a woman who wishes to optimize her treatment and perhaps leave the possibility of conception on the table has to pay out of pocket to have a custom prescription compounded, and believe it or not, in 2017, the natural hormones often used in these compounds, and the use of them to treat these conditions, is not FDA approved because of the stigma of even mentioning hormone problems and the full impact they have on a woman's health, both physically and mentally. Few researchers or pharmaceutical companies want to touch it because they will be consumed by an avalanch of women who don't suffer these problems and are not knowledgeable about them due to an ironic twist of misogyny.

In another ironic twist of misogyny, there is one hormone problem that will get a woman a referal to an endocrinologist instead of a shrug or prescription for anti depressants, and that's when she has too much testosterone and starts growing facial and body hair.

The message the medical community sends is, it's ok for women to be tired, depressed, overwhelmed, in pain, have no libido and bleed heavily and randomly because society has accepted the lie that that is a normal part of being female, and those things are compatible with our ideals of femininity but if she is growing a beard and horny as heck, that absolutely must be treated because those are male things and thus not ok for females.

It's twisted.

Nope. Sometimes that is the best part. No response to them. It can really set them off. 

&gt;I want to ask you. You’ve been through a lot of difficult experiences and have had some really nasty people in your life. Do you ever lose hope in there being good people with empathy, compassion and care out there, willing to be a part of your world? Do you ever lose faith in people?

Nope. I never do. I never lose faith. All I need to do is look at my sons and I see all I ever need to see. One wears his heart on sleeve, is deeply empathetic, and highly compassionate, but he has an amazingly strong set of boundaries and knows how to use them and has even back in high school. For instance, he found out that a acquaintance was in need, came from a financially at risk family because he was volunteering at a food pantry in the community. He didnt want to embarrass his friend, he didnt want to violate his privacy. So he figured out how to take food and leave the bags on the porch without being caught. And he got word that they got help from CPS, which is a miracle in itself in this day and age. Another friend had an abusive homelife. Not outright predatory type abuse, the kind where people just dont have the coping mechanisms, the stress and fear was creating a very bad environment, and he was afraid to go to the CPS himself, so he went to the guidance counselor knowing he was a mandatory reporter. He also got word that they got help and things were going well in the household and saw his friend become so much more happy and better. I dont think the friend has any idea that he did that. He didnt want to make him uncomfortable or feel embarrassed or violate his privacy more then he did. And these were things he did on his own quietly in high school. He thought that out. He still seems too vulnerable to me, but he balances it so much better then I do at 45. He has a collection of stuffed animals he keeps in his dresser draw. His friends even know about his ""Stuffies""., No one teases him. And his, what I call ""Teabag buddies"" which cracks him and I up because, well, you know. But they are the ceramic little statue like things that come free in I think Red Rose tea. And hes very artistic and draws and loves that stuff. And he values it. And he LOVES baby goats. Recently he was feeling very down after a friend died from an overdose. His girlfriend secretly sent him a big stuffed goat with a note about a ""drive by goating"". He LOVED it. It was great. And she hid it that it was her for like a week. Hilarious. Hes a great kid.

My other kid goes about things in a different way. He HATES bullies. He loved his teachers, most all of them. Developed good relationships with them and the principals. But bullies, obvious ones picking on smaller kids (my kids are pretty big) was a no go. I learned about this afterwards, because I would have told him to be less obvious about it, but apparently some ""accidents"" would happen to them. Lockers seemed to open on their faces. They would slip and fall a lot. And their victims would not be bullied anymore. But the really odd thing is that the bullies then turned their focus to him, not to bully, but for validation and support, and he actually helped them to learn and be better and happier. Im not big on physical ""accidents"" and would not have let him do it, but he said the teachers knew, literally looked the other way because they knew these are bullies and were being abusive. Still not okay. But the results did surprise me. He saw the bullies as needing help too. And they probably did. And he admittedly got their attention. And reached out to them when they reached out to him. Surprised me. He really developed some incredible leadership and team player qualities that are really impressive. Hes just starting to realize that what I was saying was real, not just ""Mommy vision blowing smoke up his arse"" now at 22. He is a very uncoordinated kid. Seriously. And when he took up football at the end of 8th grade out of no where, I was shocked. But I watched him. He was terrible at it, a real mess on the field. So I remind him of that, that he sucked at it, but I tell him the truth. He developed this incredible leadership and team thought aspect, important life skills as a kid. Its a very big deal to me to have that, to have gotten so good at this without much direction so young. I watched him try so hard, to be a team player, to be a solid moral backbone of a team that admittedly sucked. Hes just now starting to realize what a big deal that quality is and to explore it further. But his feelings go very very deep and he is more shut off and less open to feelings and emotional vulnerability. Hes working on that. He is only 22. But hes finding his way. And Im amazed at the depth of his compassion, his ability to find people and make connections with them that run deep. Hes a great kid.

No way I can lose faith in humanity when I have them in my life. And I understand why my Sister and Brother are like they are. I know the explanations behind it. Sometimes when hurtful and bad things happen as kids, one kid copes by becoming highly empathetic and going in our direction, others cope by going in the opposite direction. I understand why my Dad is the way he is. He lived with an incredibly selfish and manipulative Mother. Had to listen to his older brother dying each day for 14 years while he cried out in pain. He got polio as a kid, lived with minimal effect, while his Dad got it from him and ended up in an iron long and paralyzed for the rest of his life and ended the marriage and was treated terribly by him and the rest of that side of the family. I understand how his Mother, my Grandmother got how she was, her father was an incredibly violent and vicious abusive rapist. Her Mother blamed her for his raping his own daughter for seducing him by violent physically and emotional abuse. So I get why she got the way she did. There is always an explanation. Always. I dont think they are evil. I dont think that way. I think they are broken. And they always will be at this point. And I cant try to change them or fix them. They dont want that help. So what I have to concern myself with is protecting myself from their abuse. I have to see my own humanity and value it. 

I see my roommate, who is British (so there are so many many things to mess with him about, like making him say aluminum and water as much as possible) that clearly had an abusive childhood, but cant deal with it yet. I see him needing to connect and I try to help him with that without pushing him. I see his pain. And I see his joy when he plays with the good for nothing goofy Damn Cat and the 7 month old 75 pound and still growing black lab puppy of ours who he says he doesnt like (as he buys him treats and toys and take him for long walks, and plays stick with him constantly) at all. I see the humanity.

And honestly, when I look at Damn Cat, and Bo Doggie, I see humanity there even if they arent human. The love, the empathy, the joy of just being near one another, its so wonderful. 

I dont put much stock in big deal things. I look for happiness, joy, pleasure in the small things. Those are the things that make me happy. I may be in terrible pain each day. I might not have money. I have lots of debt from the dead Nex still outstanding. But I can still smell the sweet fresh cut grass in the summer. I can listen to music that brings me such peace and joy. I can watch An Affair to Remember, and Trading Places (its a damn Christmas movie no matter what my kids say). There is so much joy in this world. So much beauty. So much to keep faith in life and the future. Messed up people arent new. They arent unique. They will always be around. You cant let them steal your joy, your happiness, or faith in others. You just have to be careful to keep them out and protect and balance defenses. There will always be disappointments. There will always be problems. Thats part of life. No one gets life without them in some form or another no matter what it looks like from the outside. Its not about the big things. Its really about the little things. And they are all around you all the time. And not live angry. Anger doesnt hurt others, just you.

"dqvfryu","Hey, thanks!

To answer your questions, yes, that is a euphemism. It would basically be an assisted suicide (I guess? Although sirens are technically already dead.) Specifically though, a siren can only pass on this way if he/she lets go of the lingering emotions that kept them there. I'm still working this out, but if you kill a siren without he/she doing this, the siren will either reform or cease to exist (soul and all). 

And the character in question is an aspiring knight. He's around 13 or so in this flashback, and the point I'm trying to emphasize is his empathy towards others. At this point he's a half-decent swordsman but recently rejected from becoming a squire at this tourney the local lord held. His head is filled with typical childlike stories of becoming a knight, saving the princess, etc. He's dilligent and compassionate but very naive. Part of the scene I've already written involves him blushing in embarassment when the siren tries to seduce him. 

A secondary motivation for this encounter is that this siren's recent appearance in the area has claimed the lives of a few fishermen already, and the local lord put out a reward for killing it. In helping the siren, the hero unwittingly satisfies this lord's request and is named a squire to the lord's middle son, thus starting the hero's path to knighthood.

And I'm unsure if this will make it into the book. There's a bit of a timeskip between this chapter and the rest of the story, so I was just using it for now to flesh out the character &amp; writing style better.

"dqqrcxt","Hey thanks dude! Looking good is the only thing that’s ever been expected of me, so thank you for that validation I so desperately needed. 

The thing is that every man and woman has their own story, their own narrative to perpetuate, their own thoughts and feelings. And each one is as valid as the next. Cause we’re all humans having a human experience, right? Well some of us are more robotic than others and unable to feel feelings like most humans, but that’s another story or narrative or however you want to define it. 

Historically women and people of color have been given specific rights. They were gifted those freedoms based on their perceived worth. Who had the power and authority to give such a generous gift like autonomy? There was a time when women were only allowed to be teachers, secretaries, homemakers or in rare cases, nurses. The stereotype being that women are nurturing, submissive and compassionate but not actually worthy of a higher education or an equal democratic voice. Who gets to decide if an industry is masculine or feminine? Or the better question is actually why gender labels are being attached to industry? By labeling one half of humanity as an other or an enemy, we all lose. 

Those that consider themselves weaker or inferior tend to tear other humans down to their own perceived level. This isn’t gender specific. It’s happened to me personally. And the vast majority of people I interact with have similar stories because it truly affects us all. 

Taking away a humans own perceived strength to feed your personal weakness or insecurity is not ok, especially in a school or work setting where ones livelihood is put on the line. It’s interesting to see these stories of men in the media, ones that would be considered pillars of power in their industry, fall flat on their faces for their sexual power grabs. The implication on the victim being that all your hopes and dreams, everything you have ever wanted and worked hard for, now hinges on whether or not I consider you fuckable. Just one example of the toxic cycle of abuse that plagues us. And yet female contraception is still a political roadblock and menstrual supplies are taxed more than liquor. Doesn’t surprise me when we see men in power taking control over women’s reproductive organs and ignoring their hearts and minds.

And it’s totally ok to be angry about all the shit these hungry ladies are smearing everywhere. They’re pissed off. I can understand why they are mad and why people feel disenfranchised by the changes in society. Times are tough and a lot of people are looking for something or someone to take out their fury on. 

Aggressive behavior and projections of anger are what eventually break down communication channels. Maybe that’s why both mens rights activists and feminazis get a bad rap? That’s what I can glean from this comic. I can empathize with a little girl being told that she can’t have goals for fear that someone will hurt her, rather than educating her on how to set boundaries and shield herself from those that wish to steal her spirit or esteem. We can only truly connect when we put a stop the hate and violence that has plagued us. 

Maybe instead of judging one another for the burdens we carry, we can start understanding, accepting and healing ourselves! WHAT?!? Working together also requires the revolutionary concept of compromise, so let’s not expect things to get better until after they get much worse. Playing the blame game won’t help anyone. Doesn’t cost anything to just listen and be kind when people open up their storybooks, I mean narratives, to you and the world. 

Sending much LOVE to you kind stranger!

"dqq5avv","&gt; I understand how you got that impression, but I could not disagree with you enough. However, since this isn't another ""Why I like Corrin"" topic, I'll go more into my problems with SoV's plot.

What do you mean, that impression? That's literally the plot. An abridged summary of it, but that's the plot.

&gt; You say that the conflict between Zofia and Rigel is more grey then the conflict between Hoshido and Nohr, which it is (Not that a war has to be morally grey where everyone is at fault imo)

But that's the thing. Nohr is very blatantly at fault, whereas there's much more grayness between Zofia and Rigel. Neither side is perfectly in the right, whereas with Nohr, it's clear that Hoshido's the innocent one and the 'right' choice.

&gt;  most of the Zofian army is still competent enough to actually function as an army, and Dexais, Clive, Mathilda, etc. are all pretty strong, in-universe. 

Not really. The remnants of the Knights of Zofia only really survived the initial invasion by the skin of their teeth. It's clear that the Deliverance has been losing men for a while now and is in dire straits by the time Alm and company come on the scene, which is why his arrival is greeted with so much fanfare (outside of Fernand).

Mathilda is their best fighter, and she was captured and being held hostage on threat of execution. Everyone else is kind of just average. 

And the story and certain NPCs makes it clear that the crops are failing and people are in danger of starving, not to mention all the terrors and monsters that popped up. It could be more clear, but it's there if you pay attention. I haven't played SoV in a while and I remember those mentions.

&gt; Don't get me wrong, Garon and Iago are still bottom-of-the-barrel tier, but I'm not going to say that Berkut and Rudolf are better just because they were more complex, even if those complex parts don't work at all.

Berkut and Rudolf at least feel like people rather than cheap one-dimensional cutouts meant only to be antagonistic and evil. Garon and Iago and Hans aren't even interesting for that split second. Not to mention, [Conquest](#s ""Slime monster is the most ridiculous thing I've ever fought in an FE game, hands down."")  You spend almost the entirety of CQ as the attack dog for evil guy who is evil with no other character depth and crying about it. That's much more unforgivable than villains whose writing starts out strong, but falters at the end. I at least remember Berkut as having a lot of potential as an antagonist and his strong impression. Garon and the crew are just reminders of the lows of CQ's writing.

&gt; Zofia/Rigel is still not as Black and White as Hoshido/Nohr (Where Nohrians live in a sewer), but between Zofia and Rigel, oneb is clearly better, especially after factoring the Duma and Mila Faithfuls.

Not really. Both of them have their issues, which is the point of the game. Both of them have good traits and bad traits. Zofia is relaxed and compassionate, but slothful and corrupt. Rigel is physically strong and hardworking, but cold and uncaring. The point is that they have to combine their philosophies into the perfect balance. If you got 'Zofia is better than Rigel' out of that (when they're very clearly classist, were ruled by a lecherous asshole who only really cared about physical pleasures, were ambivalent toward Rigel's suffering, etc.) means that you missed the point quite hard.",1512347120,"zofia is relaxed and compassionate, but slothful and corrupt.","relaxed and compassionate","compassionate",NA,FALSE,"relaxed and compassionate","relaxed",NA,NA,0

"dqlhkop","No it doesn't sound convoluted.  When you're in the thick of a maze, it's easy to lose your bearings, and also easy for someone watching from the outside to see exactly what's wrong.  

&gt; Namely, I always end up falling under the emotions at the time instead of being this stone wall you mention. I start firm but compassionate, but in retrospect, I never stay in that state. She gets going and I fail to stand my ground.  

In short, you get drawn down to her level of turning it into an emotional fight.  That won't work, not now not ever.  It's not how progress is made or how conflict is resolved.  You won't find a mutual solution to an emotional argument- the only 'winning' is verbally bashing your opponent's face in with stronger emotions.  Once that happens, any hope of making progress is lost.  

&gt; Whenever I do this, it never works. She wants to talk about it then and there and the whole 15 minute break thing totally goes over her head.  ...  But maybe with this new approach it will go over better?  

Imagine a small child having a temper tantrum.  What do you do to make the tantrum go away?  You can't engage with the kid and start yelling at him, rather, you just put him in time out and you make having the tantrum no longer a productive activity for him.  Eventually it goes away, and in time he learns that tantrums aren't a good way to get what he wants.  

Same deal here.  Do this at home, but be the ice wall.  If she starts flipping out DO NOT engage, just calmly repeat in a neutral tone of voice 'we can pick this up after you calm down' or 'this is not worth yelling about, calm down a bit and we can keep talking' or 'I'm just going to sit here quietly and peacefully for a while, once you're ready to sit quietly and peacefully with me we can enjoy the couch for a few mins and then pick up our discussion'.  Or something like that.  
Now the first 1-3 times you do this it may well make her even more angry.  When you're angry, one of the most angering things is someone who refuses to acknowledge your anger, but rather just sits there and smiles.  So to avoid making it worse, try not to smile or laugh no matter how absurd she may get.  Be an ice wall, no reaction.  Eventually she has to calm down at which point you can pick it back up again.  Repeat as necessary.  

&gt; and this:  ...  are, I think, our only chance at making this work. And if this doesn't work...I believe you and I both know there is only one more stop on that road.  

That may be.  Keep trying the other stuff, again be the ice wall / stone wall.  Don't engage her emotional tantrums.  Make them as non-productive as possible.  Hopefully she will learn (on an emotional level) that tantrums not only don't win the argument but prevent any resolution from being had, thus setting her back rather than moving her forward.  
But yes, if everything I've said fails, and she refuses to go to therapy even under threat of you leaving; more specifically if you have tried all available options to change her behavior and it isn't having any effect, then you either accept a life without other friends or hobbies, or you move on.  :(",1512105919,"i start firm but compassionate, but in retrospect, i never stay in that state.","firm but compassionate","compassionate","but",FALSE,"firm but compassionate","firm",NA,NA,0

I start firm but compassionate, but in retrospect, I never stay in that state. She gets going and I fail to stand my ground.

&gt; you start supportive/friendly, she says no, you use logic, she gets defensive, you get frustrated, she gets emotional, and now you're having another screaming fight about how she is/isn't good enough for you. Right?

haha it's actually funny how right you are!

&gt; 'look we need to have this conversation calmly, so let's cool our heads and pick this back up in 15 minutes' and just walk away for 15 mins.  

Whenever I do this, it never works. She wants to talk about it then and there and the whole 15 minute break thing totally goes over her head. I've suggested that a number of times when things escalate and she hates the idea. She will invariably follow me every time I've tried, even out into the street once with trafic and a couple times she will insist on having the talk in public spaces, should the subject suddenly come up... I don't know, man, it's weird. She doesn't understand the concept of a ""cool down"" period, or putting the argument on hold. But maybe with this new approach it will go over better?  

Right now though,

this:

&gt; Be a wall of stone- pure logic and facts, no emotion, impervious.

and this:

&gt; So next time she is promising the world , make her promise to make an appointment with the therapist that day and make the appointment for within one week. That way you can hold her to it- the almost-breakup is fresh in her mind and she has promised immediate action so you can demand she make the call literally as soon as she calms down. No time to let that fade into memory and fall back into habits. I suggest if she is doing it, hold her hand and make it positive- go there with her maybe or something.

are, I think, our only chance at making this work. And if this doesn't work...I believe you and I both know there is only one more stop on that road.

Strong grades. I'd be lying if I said this wasn't important. In all my pre-req classes, I had only one A-, all the rest were A's. I'd strongly recommend applying many places, and then re-taking classes to get A's until you get in. I worked my ass off for two years for this, and so can you. My earlier grades were bad...I had D's and F's and W's even. My cumulative though, due to better grades the last 2 years, was 3.38 at the time I got admitted to OHSU. I heard that most people that are accepted have no more than 1 or 2 grades below an A on their prerequisites.
I’ve heard of a student that applied with a 4.00 prereq GPA and a 3.99 cumulative and did not even get an interview.
Work experience in healthcare was certainly helpful, but not required. Volunteering is a good alternative, but if I were starting fresh I'd probably get my CNA2 license, or work as a HUC, or similar.

"dq1e9lt","Clara. She was brilliant, had a great character and a very interesting character development. She had a fantastic chemistry with 11 and especially with 12. She loved her adventures with the Doctor more than anyone else, but also maintained a ""normal"" life when she wasn't travelling with him. She didn't love the Doctor, and never considered him to be a perfect, immortal, and infallible god, as many other companions have done. She recognized his strengths, but was also fully aware of his weaknesses. She understood the way he thought and felt, and didn't just blindly accept everything he told her. She didn't just live her life from one day to the next, but had clear goals and ambitions, unlike most other companions. She also wasn't a ""pet"" but constantly helped the Doctor on his adventures. That is what companions are supposed to do, in my opinion, but most of them just help out in a ""Deus ex Machina"" way. She wasn't a ""damsel in distress"", and always tried solving her own problems first, before trying to get help from the Doctor, which she also hardly ever did. When in trouble, she wouldn't just wait for the Doctor to solve all problems for her, she would actively try to sort them out by herself. 

She was incredibly intelligent, curious, brave, selfless and compassionate, but also vain, arrogant and needy. She was a control freak who lied and deceived others for her own benefit. A lot of the time she only cared about winning, regardless of what it would take to do so. But in my opinion, these negative character qualities just make her an even better companion, as they make her seem like a real person. Most companions have too perfect characters for my taste, which makes them seem a bit flat in comparison, especially if they stay for more than one series. 

Clara also developed significantly from series to series. In 7B, despite the common belief, she had almost exactly the same character as she would have in series 8 and 9. She was just a bit shy and cautious to begin with, so she didn't always say and do what was at the top of her mind. By the time of series 8, she had grown quite confident and recognized that she could sometimes tell the Doctor what to do, rather than always following his lead. At first she found it difficult to to accept the radical change in the Doctor's personality, but she eventually got a lot closer to 12 than she had been with 11. She helped shape 12's personality, ensuring that he was more compassionate and empathetic than he had initially been. But she also strengthened his desire to always save the day, regardless of the cost. In series 8 she often tried to impress the Doctor, but in series 9 she only cared about doing whatever it took to save the day, especially when she was separated from the Doctor. Face the Raven was the ultimate culmination of that character development. She was almost more like the Doctor than he himself in that episode. Her risk-taking and sacrifice are nice parallels to 12's actions in Mummy on the Orient Express, and 10's sacrifice to save Wilfred. She accepts her demise, and even spends her final moments trying to persuade the Doctor to not avenge her and not disregard his set of rules. She stands her ground, and faces her fears, remaining compassionate and brave until the very end. 

She initially overestimated her abilities, and underestimated how easy it was to be the Doctor, so she made some mistakes along the way, while trying to emulate him. But she learned from them, and really did get increasingly similar to the Doctor. Apart from when she tried to burn the TARDIS keys, she was never cruel or cowardly. And her reaction then perfectly mirrors the Doctor's attitude after seeing her die. I personally really liked this character development, as it helps solidify the Doctor as a ""role model"". Humans are often portrayed on the show as stupid and ignorant, being unable to solve the problems they created for themselves. If humans do try to solve some problems, they usually do so in a morally wrong way. The Doctor on the other hand is often shown to be almost god-like. He almost always saves the day, and almost always does so in a morally right way. The show often seems to indicate that if you encounter a problem, the best thing you can do is hope and pray that the Doctor arrives, so that he can solve it for you. Clara is the most noticeable exception to this rule. She only asks for his help when she really can't solve a problem on her own. And she tries to be more like him. The path there is rocky, and she makes several mistakes on the way. But she doesn't give up, and eventually even learns to fly the TARDIS (so far also the only human to be able to do so, and the only person we've ever seen learning to fly the TARDIS). In my opinion, what this says is that we can all act more like the Doctor if we try to. We can solve our own problems and we can find morally correct solutions. We can be more like the Doctor. 

Also, Jenna Coleman did a brilliant job at portraying Clara. Most of what I mentioned above wouldn't really have worked if whoever played Clara didn't do so convincingly.

We need to stop blaming the victims, but also enable the police and prosecutors to pursue and prosecute offenders to the greatest extent of the law.  We need to prosecute drug crimes, but also be lenient for first time offenders.  And stringent for repeat offenders.

This is going to cost a lot of money to clean up, and people with more than they need (like myself) need to share more of the burden.

"dpwn7w2","&gt;Kids will and can care if treated properly.

While this is the norm, it does not stop exceptions like the above from happening.  I believe most adult children of parents who need care would step up in whatever ways possible and do what needed to be done.  I believe most people are kind and compassionate.  

But I have been in the field long enough to know that some people are terrible.  Adult Protective Services exists for a reason.  I've worked with adults who were financially exploited by their children, who lived in unsafe situations that warrented an APS referral, dealt with accusations of abuse.  It happens.  It's sad as fuck.

I do blame the parents, if I have information that would lead to that conclusion.  I mentioned in a comment elsewhere about my neighbor-drunk, racist, pill popper-and I don't blame the kids for not being involved with him.  If that is what he is like now I can only imagine what he was like as a father.  And that's just the glaringly obvious situations.  Some are harder to  discern.  But.  Families talk.  You learn.  And sometimes the elderly parent will admit they were a shitty parent and that's why their kids don't visit (this is rare.  Super rare.  But it happens).

"dpubtol","I think this is a very honest and valid reason to stay home. Additionally, while your daughter is doing better now and getting the treatment she needs, she should probably stay home and just rest to reduce any exposure to germs that could set her back. You don't explicitly say what happened or what her diagnosis was, but it sounds like it was a severe respiratory infection of some kind- maybe even something like Pertussis or Pneumonia. It also sounds like it took quite a toll on her tiny little body- doctors don't just induce medical comas for fun, they do it to give the patient rest so they have the strength to recover from severe illnesses or injuries. 

Staying home to rest and reduce her exposure (and that of the rest of your family) to potentially harmful germs during the peak of flu season is not a terrible idea at all, and it's not just an excuse to not see your SIL. This is a valid medical reason in order to protect your little girl from further damage/illness during an already fragile time. She's healing- she doesn't need to be pawed all over or stay up too late or travel or anything. She needs to watch the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade in her jammies and eat turkey with her mom and dad and baby brother in a nice, calm, relaxing, environment that full of only the germs she's already used to right now. 

As for your SIL- when you're ready I would suggest maybe a one-on-one coffee date or a compassionate, but honest letter from you to express your own anguish around this situation. I think that most docs nowadays tend to take a more *wait and see* approach to a lot of things because they are so cognizant of not over-prescribing antibiotics or unnecessary tests just to rule things out when 99.9% of the time the child/person just has a nasty cold or something. And, not knowing exactly what happened with your little one, this could have been a relativelYou said your SIL is a Family Physician- I'm assuming that's the same as a GP. And while GP/Family Phys. are very smart and well versed in regular family med stuff, a board certified pediatrician is really the best doctor to treat children, especially for acute illnesses. Pediatricians are rained to look for and spot very specific ways that different illnesses present in children vs. adults. They have very specialized training for treating children exclusively. Children aren't just mini adults- their bodies react, respond, and present illnesses differently than an adult in a lot of cases. This might explain why the doctors at the ER and Children's Hosp. were able to catch her illness so quickly- they're trained to look at children a little differently.

"dpt9w5c","Red Skelton gave a great speech on the Pledge of Allegiance. I’ll paste the important bit here:

&gt;	Since I was a small boy, two states have been added to our country, and two words have been added to the Pledge of Allegiance: “under God.” Wouldn’t it be a pity if someone said that is a prayer, and that would be eliminated from schools too?

If you want to watch the whole speech (Its only 4 minutes, I highly advise you to watch it), here is the link:

https://youtu.be/TZBTyTWOZCM

I think that speech should be more than enough to reinvigorate anyone’s love for our country, but I’ll give my two cents anyways:

You are not the first person to feel this way, and certainly won’t be the last. When Red gave this speech, a law was passed not to long before that banned prayer from being recited in public schools, and there was a growing resentment for the government for our involvement in the Vietnam war. 

However, with all of the corruption and injustice out there, there is still a great deal to br proud of this country for. Look at all the local government declaring their cities and states as sanctuaries from the president’s vendetta against immigrants. Even though there’s still racial discrimination going on, this is not the norm. One incident is too many, so yes there are enough to warrant a movement because it is a huge problem, but look at the Rhode Island judge who went viral for his compassionate but fair leniency. Love for your country and love for your government are not the same. The same country that has people that discriminate also has scholarships and opportunities for the marginalized to succeed. The media is 90% negative, so don’t let it blind you to the good going on in our country.

Lastly, the under God line, which was not originally in the pledge, was probably added with one specific God in mind, but that doesn’t mean that it has to be interpreted that way. Whatever God you believe in can be represented in this line, and if you don’t believe in any God, just remember that you live in a country where you have that right.

"dpri543","I agree with your general argument here, I think sometimes we are nice with a specific reason and I agree with whoever said being kind and being nice are two different things. Sometimes we are deliberately nice for altruistic reasons say your friend had a crap day so you go out of your way to do something to cheer them up. That’s being nice with an end goal. Say that same friend had a crap day and did something to cheer them up because you can’t bear hearing them bitch about it, that’s still nice but for less savoury reasons. 

I think also it can be great to be on the receiving end of someone being nice, if my partner does something to cheer me up because he wants a quiet life I’m still cool with that. He still had to be thoughtful in the first place and it’s nice to know someone is putting extra effort in. 

I also think it’s especially important to put effort in when starting a relationship. I’m not saying people should be different but I think that putting in effort shows you are interested. An example would be going on a date, you think about how you present yourself, you don’t hide the fact that some days you don’t do your hair or make up but you do those things when you meet up.

2) You cannot predict the actions another person will take, and you shouldn't try. Do what you can do to diffuse the situation (which is to illustrate that you understand the problem, and that you will act differently next time), and then walk away. It's not your responsibility to ""fix"" anything. There is nothing to fix. Guilt is largely a useless situation, once you have realized your mistake.

Failing to express/display empathy is pretty common - that doesn't mean that people fully lack it.

"doqphnq","&gt; Frankly, if I had my way, I'd see the wall built where needed, enforcement enhanced in other areas, and easier legal immigration for those coming from dangerous areas. Once the border was secured, I do something like like have a surprise 2 month clemency deal, where anyone in the country illegally could become legal if they show up and do their paperwork. After those 2 months, there would be a 0 tolerance policy. If you don't do your papers in that period, you are out, compassion to the wind. You come in illegally after that, we'll crack down. I hope we can see some sort of compromise like that.

I mean this is the reasonable acceptable compromise most conservatives would agree to, and frankly what I expect Trump's whole endpoint was from day 1.

His rhetoric, 'extreme' as it was, was light on hard details leaving a lot of room to compromise down to something reasonable like that he can sell to his base as compassionate but tough.

The left on the other hand has dug their heels in that any kind of immigration control short of a fully open border is RACIST. Its not, reasonable people including most Democrats in Congress recognize that, but the 2016 rhetoric from the Clinton Campaign in particular drove the party into a hard corner. (Nevermind that her name is signed on the 2006 authorization that Trump is using to construct his wall.)

"doqke9h","**Name**: [Hiram Granville](https://i.pinimg.com/736x/26/ec/01/26ec01248d12d2f1e229308236fe764d--civil-war-photos-revolvers.jpg)

**Age**: 27

**Race**: Human

**Gender**: Male

**Description**: Thick brown hair and dark brown eyes. Stands roughly around 5’7” tall and weighs one hundred and thirty-five pounds. No notable scars.

**Background**: Born to a poor couple living in Atlanta, Hiram was a problem child from an early age, always causing trouble amongst his siblings, the other neighborhood children, or just being an overall pest. He was small and fast with a quick mind and a sharp tongue, yet used his wit for somewhat malicious purposes when he was young.

His father worked in an arms factory, always waking up early to head to work and always coming home exhausted. Too tired to spend time with the kids. Hiram and his five younger siblings, two brothers and three sisters, were all but raised solely by their mother. She tried her best but raising five kids on her own while her husband worked was too much, and she, more often than not, left Hiram to his own devices so she could focus on the younger kids.

There was an accident when Hiram was twelve that saw his ten year old brother drowned in a creek. His parents blamed him, knowing full well of his troublesome ways and the fact he was the only one with his brother, and disowned him. He was lucky, to be honest, because his father just about killed him as he was driven from his modest home. His brother’s death hit him harder than his disownment, and, even though it was a complete accident, felt responsible.

With nowhere to go and no means to earn money, he roamed the back alleys of Atlanta, trying to survive. He learned some less-than-savory skills as he stole food from stores and picked the locks to crates for even more food. Of course, this could only go on for so long before he was caught...or worse.

During one particular rough month, Hiram struggled to find even the slightest amount of food, and eventually passed out in the street from starvation and exhaustion. He was taken in by a pastor of one of the local churches, [Atlanta First United Methodist Church](http://historyatlanta.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/First-Methodist-Church-1946-Georgia-State-University-Library.jpg). There, he was fed, given a place to stay, and given a second chance, through God, to turn over a new leaf. In exchange, he was given duties around the church to help keep the crumbling building from falling down. The pastor and his wife raised the around Hiram as their own, and it was here he learned how to read, write, and sing, having joined the choir.

After his eighteenth birthday, he volunteered for the Georgian Provisional Army and was placed in the 6th Infantry Battalion. Despite his size, he proved to be a quality soldier and, through valor, courage and his steadiness under fire, had garnered the respect of his superiors and peers after numerous skirmishes with the raiders of the south. After a particularly bloody skirmish resulting in the loss of half his platoon, including the then sergeant, Hiram rallied what was left of the platoon and repulsed the just as bloodied raiders from the Wall. He was given the rank of Sergeant shortly after, at the age of twenty-five.

He has recently been transferred to the 10th Battalion 1st Company under Lieutenant Jonathan Custer’s command, and is awaiting further orders

**Personality**: Quiet and reserved, Hiram is kind and compassionate, but keeps to himself when not performing his duties. He is also calm and steady under fire, never willing to crack under pressure 

**Special**: 
Strength: 5
Perception: 6
Endurance: 7
Charisma: 4
Intelligence: 4
Agility: 8
Luck: 5

Skills:

**Energy Weapons**: 0 Hiram has never seen an energy weapon before, much less knows how to use one

**Explosives**: 15 He understands how to light a fuse on dynamite, but not much else**

**Guns**: 55 Hiram has been trained to use firearms effectively and consistently, and also has experience in the field

**Melee Weapons**: 55 He has been trained to use his NCO saber effectively and has shown himself to be quite the duelist/fencer

**Unarmed**: 45 Hiram is neither large or overly strong, but is quick and trained in hand-to-hand

**Barter**: 15 The Army provides him most of what he needs, so he generally has no use, or experience, in haggling

**Lockpick**: 35 A skill he has dabbled in during his troubled youth

**Medicine**: 20 Hiram has been trained in basic first-aid

**Repair**: 35 He understands how to keep his weapons and equipment cleaned and maintained, but not much else

**Science**: 0 He has zero understanding of anything science related

**Sneak**: 45 Another less-than-noble skill Hiram has picked up while he was a street urchin. He is adept at sneaking passed unobservant merchants and parents, but will likely be caught by anyone with a vigilant guard

**Speech**: 25 He can talk, and knows how to speak to his men, but he isn’t particularly silver-tongued

**Survival**: 40 Hiram knows the basic necessities of survival, both from his training and his rough upbringing

**Equipment**: Hiram carries:

"doenu3d","In the group I usually play with, there are three girls (of about 10 people). One has recently switched to McCree and does not care about stereotypes. Other two only play Mercy. To an extent that if they play together and one of them can't pick Mercy, she throws the game. Not intentionally, but when she is on other heroes, even other healers, she can't even remember buttons. 

Both have silver frames and platinum SSR. It is not about me, those stories come up everywhere. 

You see, the main source of ""girls"" stereotypes are girls themselves. Stereotypes are called stereotypes because they describe the majority. Yes, there is always a minority, (who can sometimes be a majority in number, but less noticeable), who are different. And they do get offended by stereotypes. I understand them.

But it is fruitless to call out against stereotypes. Stereotypes will exist as long as majority exists. A compassionate, but intelligent male can not honestly say ""there is no connection between gender and play"" as long as of 5 girls he meets 4 instapick Mercy and 3 can't play anything else at all. 

One can bark at men until they stop saying it loud, but the stereotype itself will not go anywhere. A more probable scenario would be when someone who did not care before will read this thread and say ""Oh yeah, girls do mostly play Mercy! How did not I notice that before!"" I definitely thought is my group only, not a whole game trend, before I read one of those posts. 

**Dear girls!**

I love all of you! Please, play what you want! But, if you play Mercy, learn at least one other character, OK? And if you don't, just ignore all the jerks (including me), like we, guys, do. If someone says you to pick Mercy, tell him to be a good girl and pick Mercy himself.  There are some things in this world that are bad in nature, but actively fighting against them brings more harm than the things themselves. Like mosquitoes. Please, don't participate in political crusades against mosquitoes.

I personally am a believer that there should be a rigourous and well formed study into whether reassignment surgery is the right thing to do. It should not happen on a whim. 

That's not because I have it in for anyone. Trans people don't affect me at all. It's not my business. 

*But* if you're going to perform such surgery on someone, it seems important that it be for the right reasons and properly justified. That person should be stable and in full posession of the facts around the procedure. It can be quite a big alteration after all! 

As an aside / context... 

I feel humans should have the right to die. We don't wish harm on our pets - so it's wrong that we force humans to live on with disabilities / conditions that leave them suffering etc. It's kinder to allow someone to choose to end their life, rather than forcing that on them. 

But... 

...there should again be very rigourous studies that it's the right thing. It shouldn't be easy to happen on a whim. Again - it's a big thing.

Honestly that is appalling. Also if she's taken Plan B then she's a hypocrite, and doesn't feel that her own rules apply to her, only to other women. 

She thinks Trump is great. Does she read the news? Does she possess critical thinking skills? Not trying to be mean but a lot of people don't, I have family members who don't, they just listen to Fox and consider everything else to be fake news. I couldn't be in a relationship with someone who thinks Trump is great, and no amount of trying to change my own thinking would make that untrue.

Climate change either exists or it doesn't. If we make the changes that would benefit the planet and future humans, and climate change turns out to be real, great. If we make those changes and climate change turns out to be a hoax, at least we made the world a better place. How anyone can be against making those changes when the cost of us being wrong is that the earth becomes uninhabitable is mind-boggling.

I'm also an atheist, and it is important to me that my partner does not believe in magic or talking snakes or hell or the church. In fact, it is so important to me, that we talked about our religious views before our relationship got serious.

Main changes are:

* Movie is 2.5 hours - a proper fantasy epic in length. 

* Characters are closer to the show's interpretation (Aang is a fun loving free spirit, Sokka is a goofy genius, Katara is compassionate but stubborn as a mule, etc.)

* Firebenders no longer have to bend from a source ... because that seriously cripples what they're able to do.

* Act structure remains mostly the same - Act 1 in the South Pole, Act 2 in the Earth kingdom, Act 3 in the North Pole, but we're introduced to Yue early on in the North Pole.

* Yue is the biggest change and is a POV character in this version. From Act 1, we see her as a fun loving rebel, who is constantly trying to shirk her responsibilities as princess - until the death of her father forces her to take on his mantle in the face of the coming Fire Nation invasion.

Don't have a shit fit but here's an anecdote, take it as anecdote if you hate them - I've met plenty of economic refugees. They said so themselves that's what they are. They do exist. In what number I don't know. Personally I meet far more 'real' refugees than 'fake' ones so I'd say it's a minority. 

But they do exist and to deny them is to constantly lie. The Left seem to think denying their existence is okay as it helps win more support for the refugee program. It doesn't. It loses people's support because people are not morons. You can't lie for the good of the program.

I have so many screenplay ideas!

Okay, I'll tell you what: I'll give you an idea from each genre.

------

**Horror:** A diagnosed schizophrenic is the only one who can effectively communicate with an on-trial murderer. The accused swears that he's innocent, and that a demon had possessed him. While investigating the man's claims, the schizophrenic starts to believe herself to be possessed. The film explores how it feels to experience a psychotic break, and how easily the lines between reality and fantasy can be blurred. A barely-audible track of aggressive whispers will play beneath the entire film.

------

**Comedy:** After a mishap involving a shipment of lobsters, a long-haul trucker (played by Jack Black) accepts a job from someone whom he believes to be a luxury goods importer... but who turns out to be a high-ranking member of a drug cartel. Mistakenly thinking that he's hauling snow imported from the North Pole, this trucker enlists the help of a mechanic (Seth Rogen) to keep his refrigerated truck in working order during the trip. Working title: Arctic Snow.

------

**Romance:** A homeless man and woman meet at the local shelter and discover that they have similar backgrounds and interests. They undertake a project to create a service for their city, which results in them seeing overnight fame and fortune. The woman stays kindhearted and compassionate, but takes her new responsibilities much more seriously than her partner, who lets the power go to his head. New relationships are explored, there are a number of tense moments, and the man eventually redeems himself... but the two of them ultimately go their separate ways.

------

**Thriller:** Set in the near future, this film depicts the world of elective brain implants that can transfer knowledge and skills with the touch of a button. After receiving an update to his electrical engineering degree, our protagonist discovers that he has phantom memories which he cannot explain. Mentioning this to the wrong person pulls the young man into a whirlwind of action, during which he uncovers a hidden conspiracy. Themes of blind acceptance, individuality, and morality are brought to light, as is the question of what truly comprises a person.

------

**Oscar-bait:** Based on a true story, this film follows the occupation of Alcatraz Island by groups of Native Americans. Kevin Costner stars in it somewhere.

------

**Family:** Despite having only lived in the big city, a twelve-year-old girl discovers a fondness for nature after visiting her distant family's farm. She is dismayed to discover that the land is in danger of being seized by some developer or another, and hatches a plan – along with the help of other local children – to save the farm using wacky shenanigans. (A number of socioeconomic and political issues will be explained in a simplified manner, and there will be a scene in which the kids all improvise instruments and play a song that's written just for the movie.)

------

**Porno:** A scrawny, eighteen-year-old man discovers that as long as he doesn't ejaculate, he can transform into an irresistible superhero. He goes up against a stunningly attractive villain who can only be defeated by an orgasm... but first, he has to seduce his way through all of her minions.

------

**Action:** Fed up with the corruption in politics and with the ever-increasing wealth divide in America, a masked vigilante takes it upon themselves to adopt the mantle of ""Robin Hood."" Backed by a hacker (of the Hollywood variety), a MacGyver-like weapons designer, and a politician who seemingly still has a soul, this faceless hero battles security, private military forces, and scores of thugs in their quest to rob from the rich and give to the poor.

"dndm9uu","LISBON — On a broken-down set of steps, a 37-year-old fisherman named Mario mixed heroin and cocaine and carefully prepared a hypodermic needle. “It’s hard to find a vein,” he said, but he finally found one in his forearm and injected himself with the brown liquid. Blood trickled from his arm and pooled on the step, but he was oblivious.

“Are you O.K.?” Rita Lopes, a psychologist working for an outreach program called Crescer, asked him. “You’re not taking too much?” Lopes monitors Portuguese heroin users like Mario, gently encourages them to try to quit and gives them clean hypodermics to prevent the spread of AIDS.

Decades ago, the United States and Portugal both struggled with illicit drugs and took decisive action — in diametrically opposite directions. The U.S. cracked down vigorously, spending billions of dollars incarcerating drug users. In contrast, Portugal undertook a monumental experiment: It decriminalized the use of all drugs in 2001, even heroin and cocaine, and unleashed a major public health campaign to tackle addiction. Ever since in Portugal, drug addiction has been treated more as a medical challenge than as a criminal justice issue.

After more than 15 years, it’s clear which approach worked better. The United States drug policy failed spectacularly, with about as many Americans dying last year of overdoses — around 64,000 — as were killed in the Vietnam, Afghanistan and Iraq Wars combined.

In contrast, Portugal may be winning the war on drugs — by ending it. Today, the Health Ministry estimates that only about 25,000 Portuguese use heroin, down from 100,000 when the policy began.

The number of Portuguese dying from overdoses plunged more than 85 percent before rising a bit in the aftermath of the European economic crisis of recent years. Even so, Portugal’s drug mortality rate is the lowest in Western Europe — one-tenth the rate of Britain or Denmark — and about one-fiftieth the latest number for the U.S.

I came to Portugal to talk with drug dealers, users and public health experts because this nation has become a model for a drug policy that is not only compassionate but also effective.

It’s not a miracle or perfect solution. But if the U.S. could achieve Portugal’s death rate from drugs, we would save one life every 10 minutes. We would save almost as many lives as are now lost to guns and car accidents combined.",1506123139,"i came to portugal to talk with drug dealers, users and public health experts because this nation has become a model for a drug policy that is not only compassionate but also effective.","compassionate but also","compassionate","but",FALSE,"only compassionate but also effective","effective","only","also",1
"dndfcbj","A democracy in the modern sense of the term would have no sense in medieval mentalities, and would be impossible to manage. In many large cities, governments would often claim legitimacy from the masses ; many city states were republics, where the people had some sort of role (sometimes nominal) and the rulers were elected, but these were not democratic by modern standards, with aristocratic families that were sometimes legally recognized as noble.

I think I should stress that medieval mentalities were different than modern ones. We think of monarchies and feudalism as inherently oppressive, but to the average person from the middle ages, that was the natural order of things. A peasant would believe it was the king's right and duty to rule, and a king would think it was his right and duty to do so. To both of them, having a monarch ruling over them by right of birth was logical, and having everyone, even a lowly serf, elect a ruler, was bullshit.

Nobles weren't inherently evil, greedy or cruel, they were simply people born in the right families. Some of them were selfish and cruel, some of them were kind and compassionate, but _all_ of them were raised with the idea that they were a group that had certain duties. A compassionate ruler who cared about his people would aim to fulfill his duties as best he could ; making sure the people he was supposed to rule over lived in the best possible condition, protecting them from harm and serving justice. The idea of a father protecting his children was often used, and is a good representation of medieval mentalities : it is a lord's duty to protect his subjects from harm and punish them when they do wrong, and it was a subject's duty to obey him. A serf wanting to rule instead of his king would be going against the laws of nature, as well as a very selfish and entitled person (never mind the fact a peasant probably wouldn't have the necessary education to rule).",1506114068,"some of them were selfish and cruel, some of them were kind and compassionate, but _all_ of them were raised with the idea that they were a group that had certain duties.","kind and compassionate","compassionate",NA,FALSE,"kind and compassionate","kind",NA,NA,0

"dn8kgkc","At long last, someone had arrived. 

The visitors began the laborious excavation. They were a careful and patient people. Despite the endless communications - constantly monitored and analyzed by an autonomous machine, the last Librarian - these Excavators were extremely meticulous in their efforts, and took weeks to open the first layer of the Vault.

Utilizing the power reserved for such an event, the Librarian began processing the language and apparent culture of the Excavators to ease the eventual encounter that would be first contact. Over the lengthy weeks it took the Excavators to breach the outer layers of the Vault, the Librarian's understanding grew exponentially. By the time they had met with the airlock leading to the Vault proper, the Librarian was confident in its abilities to greet the Excavators with charisma and understanding.

The Last Librarian had been waiting in a near vacuum of sub-zero temperatures for centuries. Its body had needed few repairs during its wait, and so the Librarian rose to finally fulfill its lifelong purpose. 

At the airlock, the Librarian sent a message, ""I beseech you, kind ones, to hear my story. If untold, it will die with me.""

The Last Librarian's message prompted immediate silence on part of the Excavators. Then, there was a cacophony of exchanges amongst the Excavators as they feverishly tried to decide on what to do with this unexpected contact.

""Your decision will determine whether the memory of my creators lives on in the universe,"" the Last Librarian offered, ""or sleeps here with me.""

Once again, its words seemed to stir the Excavators into a vibrant storm of debate and dispute. After minutes of deliberation, one Excavator acquiesced, and then there was silence.

""Who are you?"" the ambassador asked.

""I am Baldur,"" the Librarian answered. ""I am the last consciousness that has known humans firsthand. I am the last artifact that can offer a subjective truth on humanity's legacy. I am the last vestige of hope that can shed light on what humanity was, and... I am running out of time.""

Baldur's words were like the words of a dead god, and every Excavator listened with rapt attention, keenly aware that this interaction would earn them a place in the history books, not just for their species, but for any future alien race that may be met in the future. 

""Baldur, I am the Chronicler of this expedition,"" the Excavator explained. ""I must ask how you gained such mastery of our language.""

""I began analyzing your communications once you came within range of my sensors,"" Baldur answered.

""But to learn it so quickly..."" the Chronicler was confounded. 

""My mental faculties far exceed any life form known to Earth. They even surpass the capabilities of humans themselves,"" Baldur added.

""Humans..."" the Chronicler whispered, ""Were they your creator?""

""They made me, and others like me, knowing they might one day destroy themselves."" Baldur replied, ""Unfortunately, they were right.""

""How have you survived, Baldur?"" The Chronicler asked with awe.

It was then that the Librarian realized the Excavator's weren't aware of what it truly was, and so Baldur proposed, ""You will understand once these doors are open, Chronicler. You will understand that, and a great deal more once you bear witness to me.""

Once again, Baldur's words caused a firestorm of argument amongst the Excavators. Eventually, their bickering was broken by Baldur's words, ""You can point your weapons at me, if you wish, but I mean you no harm. I am suspended in a near vacuum of only nitrogen and helium. I can flood the airlock with atmosphere, but then I must come outside to speak with you. Please, make your decision soon. I am running out of time.""

That prompted a more energetic conversation between the Excavators before they finally reached an agreement.

""We have decided,"" the Chronicler announced. ""Let us meet face to face, Baldur.""

""Are you ready?"" Baldur asked.

""What do you mean?"" the Chronicler replied.

""I can open the doors from my end, Chronicler,"" Baldur explained. ""Are you ready?""

More questions and conversation erupted from the Excavators before the Chronicler waved the people into silence.

""We are ready and willing to talk, Baldur.""

Vents hissed and heaved as air desperately fought through dirt and dust to get inside. First, clouds of dirt coughed into the airlock, before being dispersed by the rush of air that was pumped inside. The locks themselves slowly rolled back hydraulic pistons that moved like old veterans trying their damnedest to finish one last job. Finally, just the two giant metal sheets that served as the doors sputtered to life just long enough to reveal the outside world to those sealed within.

There were poems that described how very beautiful a sunset could be to one who glimpsed it. Baldur gained a new appreciation for them just then. The light shined without remorse, covering everything in an orange tint that complemented the bright, blue-white lights set up by the Excavators. 

Baldur saw that they were humanoid, which actually riled up a sense of amusement and wonder. Their forms were so akin to humans, it was almost like science fiction. They had webbed feet and hands, possessing only three digits each, but still bore the same 4 limbed silhouette of a human. 

""A machine??""
*""It's a robot..?""*
**""An A.I., but...""**
""...impossible, an A.I. just isn't possible....""
*""What else but a machine could survive for so long in isolation?""*
**""...must be incredibly advanced. Just how brilliant were humans if they could...""**

The Excavators began speaking all at once after glimpsing Baldur's form.

""You communicate visually and acoustically, much like the humans that made me. Honestly, I am quite surprised by the similarity between you and my creators,"" Baldur intoned.

The Excavators were speechless. They beheld Baldur with awe. 

It was something Baldur hadn't felt in a long time, and their gaze prompted aspects of Baldur's personality that hadn't manifested since humans had gone. 

Waving both hands toward the Vault itself, Baldur became every bit of the showman that humans had loved to see, ""Bear witness, Excavators! You have roused me from my tomb, and given my life purpose once again. You come with a wealth of kindness, and shall be repaid wealth and kindness in return. Venture inside the Vault and lay claim to your prize!""

The Excavators were taken aback by Baldur's sudden change in tone, and still stood awestruck and dumbfounded.

""Take the Seed, and translate its works. The fruits of your labors will be the knowledge of all the good and evil humanity has done in its brief existence,"" Baldur summarized.

The Chronicler shook itself out of its trance first, ""What do you mean we bear resemblance to humans? Please, explain, Baldur.""

Baldur stood at its full two meter height, towering over the Chronicler, ""You have four limbs, with opposable thumbs. You speak and read and write in ways similiar to humanity. You maintain inflection in speech to emote, coupled well with facial expressions. You cooperate as a whole, but are each an individual. You build and utilize tools and machines to expand your reach. You are very much like humans, my creators.""

This sparked shock and disbelief, which confused Baldur. Certainly, they must anticipate a race like their own might exist somewhere in the universe. Maybe the chances of meeting one would be minimal, but it shouldn't be such a disturbing.... revelation?

The Chronicler spoke up before Baldur could, ""How else would you describe humans?""

""Humanity was selfish, but loving. Compassionate, but cruel. Intelligent, but ignorant. They were the products of their ancestor's missteps and the culmination of their ancestor's wisdom. They were each unique. Their guiding principles were determined by what they were taught and what they learned. Ultimately, however, their greed and apathy cost them more than they could have paid. And now,"" Baldur finished, ""they are gone.""

The Chronicler seemed to hang onto every word Baldur spoke as though it were gospel. With great interest and care, the Chronicler asked, ""Do you have any pictures of them?""

""Within the Seed, you will find many images and sounds crafted by and of humanity."" Baldur pointed to the bare sand beneath its feet, ""Would you like me to draft a simple image upon on the ground here?""

The Chronicler gestured invitingly, and Baldur knelt down and began drawing a simple image. It had to be a universal representation that could be recognized easily. In fact, Baldur had such an image already prepared. And thus, Baldur drew  the humans as represented on the Pioneer plaques.

The reaction was not what Baldur expected. 

Immediately, the Excavators fell to their knees. Some hugged one another. Some cried. Some chattered together excitedly.

The Chronicler only stared at the image, mouth agape, before finally speaking, ""Our creators..."" ",1505863402,"compassionate, but cruel.","compassionate, but cruel","compassionate","but",TRUE,"compassionate , but cruel","cruel",NA,NA,1

Do your serve chaos where you value freedom, adaptability and flexibility, but as a result may be reckless, strongly dislike authority, and irresponsible? Do you serve neither?

A Lawful Good feels like the best way to increase good is by following the laws and getting other's to follow the laws. Honorable and compassionate but restricts freedom and criminalizes self interest. **Lawful good doesn't mean kind and sweet and personable**, that's neutral good.

A Neutral Good feels like the best way to increase good is somewhere in-between law and chaos. Does the right thing without bias, but may limit the actions of the truly capable.

A Chaotic Good feels like the best way to increase good is through chaos and rebellion. A good heart with a free spirit, but tends to disrupt order and punish those who do well for themselves.

A Lawful Neutral serves the law without any specific aim to increase either good or evil. Reliable and honorable without being a zealot, but doesn't value freedom, choice, or diversity and seeks to eliminate it.

Fucking. Gold.

Do you see how scared these women are? 

I don't want to fuck a robot BUT there are a lot of men that would. 

This is classic economics. Flood the market with supply(pussy), even if it is a robot, then the price of the product will decrease. 

What's that saying people always tell white people? O yeah, to those that are privileged equality is seen as inequality.

How can women be scared of a cold lifeless doll, then not expect men to feel the least bit insecure about a vibrating fallace? Then how do you go on to not see the hipocracy in your own logic?

As I've said before, women, and feminism, are the reason society is collapsing thinks to the collapse of the family, and the rise of social media/narcissistic culture in our women. You don't see men taking pictures of themselves everyday clamoring for attention... probably because they are focused on something other than themselves.

"dmx2pqz","&gt; Discovery takes place in 2255, a full 10 years before The Original Series (and is in the Prime timeline). As Isaacs put it, this is well before Starfleet’s mandate became one of peace, which is why he plays a captain unlike any we’ve seen before.


&gt; Harberts describes the first, 15-episode season as a “war story,” one that will parallel “the violent times” we’re currently living in. Again, certain isolationist Americans are the inspiration for the Klingons, which could be related to their reimagining in Discovery, which goes beyond their altered appearance. 

&gt; There will be a resolution, one way or the other: Harberts promises that “the goal of this year is to get to a place where we find a way to end that conflict.” Don’t celebrate yet, though—everyone from the co-EP to Michelle Yeoh, who plays Captain Phillippa Georgiou of the U.S. Shenzhou, reminds us that because the stakes are so high, everyone’s life is in danger. (Here’s another clue: “copper shirts” are the new “red shirts.”)

&gt; Even more ominously, Harberts says we’ll eventually learn why the Discovery and Michael Burnham aren’t household names in Star Trek canon (and it’s not just because this series is the latest addition to the franchise). 


&gt; When describing the relationship between Burnham and Georgiou, Martin-Green and Yeoh both touch on how the adopted Vulcan struggles to reconcile her emotions with logic. Georgiou wants to “instill in her and make her understand these emotions have value for humans.” (Not only that, but Yeoh teases we’ll see Burnham and Georgiou team up again, even after the former has been reassigned).

&gt; Yeoh isn’t the first woman to play a Starfleet captain, and Burnham isn’t the first person of color to lead a Star Trek series, but their leadership of the Shenzhou is still groundbreaking for featuring two women of color. The actresses’ and writers’ feminism comes to the fore throughout, whether it’s Georgiou having a “compassionate but firm” style of leadership that’s all her own and not just a response to her male counterparts’, or Mary Chieffo portraying Klingon Battle Deck Commander L’Rell. 

&gt; our guides are admittedly light on institutional knowledge as we tour the Discovery. At various points, everyone from Harberts to costume designer Gersha Phillips says they’ll have to ask someone else for an answer to a journalist’s question. This does little to abate excitement, but there might be cause for a yellow alert.

"dmwjd34","&gt;Your view of the future of Scotland being a binary choice 

It is a binary choice. That's not really debateable. There is room in this debate for middle grounds and holding nuances views in a theoretical sense, but ultimately it matters not a jot when faced with a binary In-Out choice. It is one or the other, with all the baggage that comes with it.

I'm not talking about the EU referendum. I'm talking about independence debate, and how each side on that represents a reality with regards to the EU. There is no pro-EU, pro-UK outcome. It's impossible, regardless of how strong one might feel. There may be an anti-UK anti-EU one yet, but that doesn't really exist at present and is unlikely. What does exist are the 2 outcomes of a binary choice regarding Scotland's future, one of which has EU membership as an independent country, and one which absolutely doesn't. This latter one is Unionism. To choose unionism is to choose Brexit, regardless of how it makes you feel.

You act like I have drawn the lines. I haven't, and to act as if they aren't there and act like doing so is tribalism is just abdicating responsibility, like many people do which was my exact point. I would argue that you ignoring the reality of the situation is getting us nowhere. It is sitting on the fence while one of the outcomes establishes itself as the norm. It exists in the realms of theory and abdicates itself of any action or responsibility.

&gt;I'd suggest you campaign for a softer Brexit because that is in all likelihood going to be the world you and the rest of us inhabit for the foreseeable future.

No, I am ideologically opposed to Brexit and will campaign for Scottish independence instead, as I consider it a far, far preferable option, and an achievable one.

And I also may not inhabit it either. I'm off to Denmark next year for a good while, but with the intention of coming back. But, as my partner is an EU resident,  if I see no hope of independence and Scotland remains attached to the mire the UK will inevitably become, I will probably stay.

&gt;We cannot do that when people tell the other what they think rather than listen.

Seems like you haven't had too much interaction with every generation of people are are just biased and delusional if you think there is significantly less social pressure in younger generations.

At the end of the day every next generation (with exceptions) gets softer and softer because technology improves and correspondingly the level of comfort increases. Comfort does create soft people. The more developed the society gets, the more careless its people tend to become actually. Just have a simple observation, how many people in Syria have the time or money to play video games. Syria is very undeveloped in most aspects, the people work for basic necessities such as water and food. The things they care about are the things which matter for their survival.

"dmb53wb","I can see why someone might think that from the early episodes and if someone isn't caught-up in the more recent developments of Steven &amp; Greg's dynamics.  It's very easy for people to jump to conclusion about what is a ""good parent"" and what is a ""bad parent.""  In our first meeting of Greg, we see that Greg doesn't live with Steven, lives in a van instead, and runs a seemingly unsuccessful (or barely surviving) car wash.  At first glance, it might looks like he just dumped Steven with the gems because he isn't able to keep him around financially and/or doesn't want to be bothered with this ""magical destiny stuff.""

However, the later episodes really show how much Greg cares about Steven, how good of a relationship he has with Steven, and how despite not living under the same roof, he is emotionally (and financially) available and supportive of Steven.   Especially if you consider how he *made* the roof that Steven lives under, it's not that he was shooing Steven away, but providing him with a unique opportunity to learn more about himself and his heritage (gem-side) in a way that Greg realized that he himself could not do.  The idea that you can't teach your child everything is something I find that parents have a very hard time admitting.

Greg has a very healthy attachment to Steven and, likewise, Steven to Greg.  He has given Steven the freedom to explore, learn, and grow while still being available for Steven to go to in times of need. Steven's honestly ecstatic when Greg wants to do things with him or go on trips together.  Even way back in Laser Light Cannon - Steven didn't think twice about asking Greg for help, he knew his old man would be there for him.  If Greg were indeed ""the worst father in the entirety of everything,"" Steven's interactions with his father would be very different, something more like, ""Oh, my dad might know where it is, but I don't know... I shouldn't bug him.""   But people don't see that, a lot of times - they see the typical cookie-cutter image of what they think an ideal father is and since Greg doesn't meet that, they may assume the worst. 

In terms of ""Dear Old Dad"" or other Greg mess-ups, so what?  Parents make mistakes *all* the time, they don't always know how to connect with or relate to their kids.

Overall, Greg is an amazing dad.  Not only has he helped to raise Steven to be empathetic and compassionate, but also Steven loves him and actively demonstrates that he feels like Greg is available for him.  Steven is honestly enthusiastic and excited to hang out with him and Steven's opinion is the most important in rating Greg's competence as a father.

"dm64j3a","Great Theory, but I will have to disagree. The legend of Azor Ahai says he forged a blade, Lightbringer and tried to temper the steel in water, a lion's heart, and finally his wife.

Let's examine this legend closely, starting with the names of the hero:
1) Azor could refer to the head of the East Semitic pantheon Assur, the God of War or the Warrior. I think this is Jon.
2) Ahai is Marathi for mother. Dany perhaps. 
Is it possible that Jon and Dany together are Azor Ahai ( they keep saying together on the show)...

Next, let's examine the sword Lightbringer. What if the sword is not an actual weapon, but a metaphor for our heroes' resolve i.e., their will. How do you temper that resolve:

1) By water. Water is a symbol of movement and wisdom. Perhaps the first attempt to tamper a hero's resolve is a journey. Jon is born south and travels north. Dany is born West and travels East. Their journies continue. We know Jon travels north to the wall and beyond while Dany travels east with Drogo's khalisar. During their travels they both become adults and are thought an important lesson (Dany with Mirri Maz Dhur and Jon with the brothers that betray him). They gain wisdom and at the end of the cycle are reborn (Dany in Drogo's pyre and Jon thanks to fire magic).

2) By lion. The lion is often used as a symbol of noble families and courage in battle. Perhaps the second attempt to tamper the hero's resolve is through battle and through the lessons of governing. This is the time when Jon takes back Winterfell and becomes King in the North while Dany frees the three slave cities and rules over Mereen. Jon is reborn for a second time after he digs himself from the corpses of fallen soldiers in the Battle of the Bastards. Dany is reborn for a second time when she burns the temple of the Dosh Khaleen. In addition, Jon embraces his role as a warrior and Dany as a mother (mysah) in visually analogous scenes. At the end of this cycle they gain strength.

3) By Nissa Nissa. Now Nissa in Hebrew means ""to test"". So this is the ""test test"" or maybe ""the ultimate test"". A wife is usually associated with love and commitment. And the final trial is love. I think this refers to the budding romance between the two. In this trial, they will learn empathy and compassion and both Dany and Jon will be reborn for the third time. My guess? By having a child.

A true leader/savior needs all three traits: wisdom, strength, and compassion. Robb Stark and Ned Stark were strong and compassionate, but they were not wise. And they failed. Cerci is wise and strong, but she is not compassionate. And she will fail. 

We know that Jon is ice and Dany is fire (at least on the show). So theirs is the Song of Ice and Fire... ???? It might be a bit sappy, but I think it's better than a literal sword, the ""remember the hero is still the white guy"" trope or the ""let's fridge the love interest so our dude can have more emotional pathos"" trope...

"dm4ppss","Something that's really uncomfortable to acknowledge, and a big reason IMO for the incredible force of anti-gay politics, is that the people who espouse homophobic rhetoric are afraid that admitting the immoral and hateful nature of their position on lgbtq people **will call into question the entirety of what they preach.** 

Stop for a second and ask: are babies born to Hindu parents damned to hell, just because they were raised by parents who cared enough to teach? This idea, that people can only attain salvation through Christ, is **fundamentally inconsistent with the teachings of Christ himself.** Even the Good Samaritan was a foreigner, with foreign beliefs.

It's not the only inconsistency, but like your unwillingness to accept your homophobia, it cuts deep. Many of the inconsistencies of contemporary dogma cut deep. Sooner or later, everyone with faith will find one, and there are a few different ways they can deal with it. 

First, they can make exceptions. This is not inherently bad; everyone cherrypicks from their dogma and I don't see very many daughter auctions these days. The problem is that they cherrypick, deny that they cherrypick, and then cherrypick **only the unethical parts of what they were taught,** in order to prevent a crisis of worldview.

Second, they can abandon what they've been taught altogether. ""It's a lie, it's all a lie, fuck everything, burn the world."" Many people who do the first thing are afraid that, if they don't, they'll do the second thing.

Third, they can cherrypick in the healthy direction. They can become accepting people, choosing to live in the image of charity and service instead of accepting the self-serving fearmongering dogma.

Fourth, they can do something like what you are doing. You know that you need to change how you act from the perspective of basic human decency. You are choosing to question your beliefs. You will accept the ones that improve the human condition, and reject the ones that, despite being deeply internalized, are obviously wrong. 

I chose #4. I am not a Christian, but I still have Christian values. I'm not so egotistical as to say with certainty that there is no God, but I'm pretty sure if there is, it's not a beardy white guy. And it's a process. I'm trans, but I was so afraid of being seen as less, or seen as gay, or worse--the ""extreme gay pervert"" of the Reagan-era social narrative, that I hid from it for 38 years. 

So you're probably asking why all of this is relevant. This conflict, between beliefs and ethics, goodness and scare-quotes righteousness, is difficult. Good people, faced with something that threatens their fundamental worldview, acting in goodness, experience this conflict in an extreme way. They then often point this discomfort at the thing that made them question their values. It's easy, especially when the source of the conflict is that we were taught to hate the thing. 

Here's the piece of advice that I wish someone had given me: questioning your beliefs does not make you a worse Christian, or Muslim, or whatever else. It makes you a better one. Beliefs that are unconsidered are fragile, indefensible, and can do great harm. It's like driving around a bobcat without realizing you are dragging the claw. But when you think about it, and realize the tools with which you are equipped, you can build buildings and shore against floods. When you use the best available information, and act with ethics and compassion, you push an incremental but unimpeachable wave of positive change in front of you, everywhere you go.

In the eyes of the churches and communities where I was raised, I am an abomination. If they find honesty and heart abominable, then let them turn away, for they have willfully chosen darkness. But make more mistake; even without faith, I am a better Christian now than I ever was when I accepted the story but ignored the lesson.

Of course, your hatred need not come from faith; in many ways, churches are more reflective of their cultures than the other way around. It makes no difference. If it's clear that you are ready to make change, there are three things you must do.

The first is to get angry. You should be furious. There is a culture, which can not be blamed on any individuals, that has poisoned the minds of your community. It is the culture of intolerance. It has taught you that it is acceptable to loathe people based solely on characteristics over which they have no control. Be they Hindu babies or ginger gaybies, they did not choose to be these things. Blind hatred is the only thing we must be intolerant of. Google ""the intolerance paradox."" But be sure to aim your anger at intolerance as an abstraction; not at people. Vow to snuff it out where you see it, by being compassionate but firm with its practitioners. 

The second is to work on developing compassion. Compassion is just empathy combined with kindness. It's about understanding our common motivations and and experiences. Start every interaction by trying to understand the perspective of the person with whom you interact. What circumstances led them to this moment in time? What are their joys? Why do they suffer? We all suffer. When we understand the suffering others, we no longer see victims and enemies. Instead, we see other hearts, fighting to navigate an adversarial-but-beautiful world using imperfect knowledge and tools. We are forced to accept our privilege and shortcomings, and work with others who compliment our own strengths to improve the broader human condition.

The third is to foster patience in yourself. You have many problematic beliefs. All of us do. Learning to take the culture we are given and turn it into a tool for improving the human condition is a lifelong process. The question is: how do we keep what's good and fruitful about tradition while also casting aside ignorance, misconception, and shortsightedness? The answer is ""one thought at a time."" Accept, right now, that you will make many, many mistakes. You will sometimes be too distracted to act considerately; sometimes too uninformed or short on time; and often unaware that you are missing information. Sometimes you will intellectually understand what you should do, but still somehow fail to execute it. All of these are fine, so long as you accept the responsibility of trying to capture and examine your thoughts before you act on them. This process is called **mindfulness**, and will make you more successful at everything you do. You can google it, too. The point is not to become paralyzed with analysis, but instead, to give yourself a chance to nurture good impulses and redirect harmful ones. 

If you do these three things, homophobia is thrice broken. In fact, it no longer even stands as it's own special shortcoming, but gets swept away with a whole host of other petty hatreds. You can no longer accept the intolerance that inspired it. You can no longer tenably see lgbtq people (or, indeed, any people) as a group of people who are set apart from you, but must accept them as warm siblings in a cold space. Your impulses no longer burn you with anger, but instead inspire daily growth. 

You can't just snap your fingers and get there, but the road is longer than it is hard. You are not alone in challenging the world you were brought to understand. It may isolate you, but isolation is temporary. On the other side, you'll find the whole of humanity waiting.

Ball's in his court. Be compassionate but firm. Good luck. 
Here's a quote from a poster earlier today of what she laid out: 

"" You know what? I'm tired of this but I'm gonna give you a way out. Listen to me, I haven't said anything to your mom because it's none of my business if she wants to be crazy, not my animals, not my circus.. YET. I can deal with it as much as it makes me mad. But you're gonna ask me to marry you and then it's gonna be MY business. And I'm going to go after your mom, I'm not gonna take her shit any longer. I will take you far away and make you so happy that you won't remember you have a crazy mom. So, it's up to you, either you deal with your mom NOW or I will do it for you, and she's not gonna like it. Don't doubt my word.

But if you decided that you won't do anything and won't let me deal with it, I have to say that the doors of my heart are always open and you can take yourself out. I was very happy before you, and as much as I love you, I fucking know that I will be happy after you. Right now you know your mom is hurting me and you are LETTING HER. So you decide, are you gonna step up and be a man or you are gonna stay being a mamas' boy? Tell me now so I don't have to waste my time."" ~ u/am_I-crazy

The Doctor is a very dangerous individual, and I feel like in Nu Who they keep have to reminding the audience of how dangerous and inhuman the Doctor is (which is one of the reasons why I dislike the idea of the Doctor being romantically involved with human companions). He may be benevolent and compassionate but he is on an entirely different level from humans. 

He cares, but in the same way as a person would care about their favorite pet. He has immense amounts of compassion but his kindness is the only thing that prevents him from becoming a monster. 

I like it when Doctor Who explores the line between his kindness and the darker sides of his personality. It is much more interesting than him being just a benevolent alien that goes around helping out (because to reduce him to just those characteristics removes a great deal of his depth). I want a Doctor that struggles with the darker sides of his personality and is put into situations where there is no obvious right answer.

"dlwcxn7","Wow thanks for replying. You make some really good points, again and it's great to read your stuff. There's real clarity, unlike some of my comments lol.

Regarding Androssi, oh I remembered and wanted to say, while I do think she may have done something cunning to get to the head of the table, I think that scene of her eating those corpses really was from her past, because remember how she didn't want to eat meat on Evankhell's floor? - It looks like some trauma. Actually it's really amazing how subtle SIU's writing was and I have yet to see this level of attention to detail. I know he's busy with his art he's putting so much time, but the story just feels different and sort of rushed, whereas before, it felt like more things happened, even though he took his time.

About fairness, well what does it even mean? In the tower, it's mostly might equals right. But I think Androssi would have passed even if she did nothing. Simply because of her abilities as a princess. But I think what's most unfair is the system where only few people get to progress. Like in schools with exams, if it was a team mark, and even if the group won, only certain members of the group pass, and some do not, do you think that is fair? It's a messed up system I think.

About Rachel, she has plot armour. So it's safe to say she won't die. In the first floor, SIU did something very smart by having Lero-ro talk about luck being the most important factor, and in a way Rachel is really lucky despite not having the thorn or much else. She's lucky to be alive and still climbing despite her weaknesses. I think she'll make it to just near the end. 

It feels like Bam was more decisive before. Now he comes across as a really naive and idealistic and personally, with MC characters, I tend to dislike those types the most. People who have no idea how the world works and are borderline delusional, who mean well but are so out of touch with reality they sometimes make things worse. He needs to be more relatable! I do like that he is kind and compassionate, but he takes it to an extreme. 

Something to note, I don't know if you remember, but Bam is the way he is, because he was taught everything by Rachel! She eve wrote a book called how to be a cool guy v2, and remember how she told him never to betray anyone especially a girl? I do wish he would change his personality and grow more, and be just a bit more humourous. With him saying unacceptable, I don't know if it was something lost in translation. I don't remember where I read it, in a blog or some comment, but I think it was supposed to be more like I can't accept that/ can't understand that. I'm not sure if it is right and I'll have to look it up. I do agree about his obsession. He should let go. Bam got the best advice from Androssi, to follow his own dreams and to stop chasing Rachel way back in the floor of tests. I hope he can just be his own entity and not define himself Rachel's follower. His inner self is a sun dammit! He shouldn't be orbiting others! It's just taking really long week by week. This new arc won't done before the years' end...

But Bam's cataclysmic failure? I'm looking forward to it, so he can finally grow out of his shell. He's super polite to everyone in a very formal/putting others at a distance sort of way. I hope he can loosen up. I'd love to see him finally just lose it and crack jokes and use humour as a way to cope. But I don't know how far his personality will get to that. He seems deeply reserved.

The Rachel grrr ie PMSing, I think in this arc she'll change as she gets used to her new power. I agree her character before was much more ambiguous and likable with her going out of her lighthouse with Hoh for Bam's sake! She felt more mysterious for sure, even almost enigmatic. Btw she didn't push Khun out of the way. She just tried to argue on his behalf with Grand De Lee, who viewed her as a traitor and so tried to kill her! Which is messed up. Like basically lives in the tower are meaningless and killing is actually the norm. WHich is why you get entitled personalities like Hoaquin. They're just following the House leaders like Gustang, who think everyone is a bug, so that mindset and attitude is just filtered down... 

About Prince I disagree. It was his final development as a character. All this time, since he was introduced he was somewhat despicable or cowardly. Even in the hell train when he was picked for the Dallar show, he kept shouting and was so terrified. So to see someone who was really pretty selfish and just a kid really, make that sacrifice to save a teammate, it really made me feel: well done kid. What's really sad is when the hell train arc started, Miseng, Prince and Arkraptor were never supposed to be there. They dropped off Bam and Khun and Rak and were flying away in the plane when suddenly they were brought on as hostages by the FUG train conductor. 

Thanks for writing. It's a super long story and I think it will be years before it is over.

"dlaznnj","Yes, I do understand what you are saying.   I actually have heard men say the reason they like Girl Writes What so much is that she speaks in a soothing voice and tells them things they've heard feminists say about men aren't true.   I can see how some feminist writings can be especially hurtful to kind and self-reflective men.

In the OP article, the author says things that can be hurtful to women reading it, especially the nth iteration of the cheating batterer who never has any trouble getting laid.  If I were to criticize him for say, relegating battered women to supporting cast members in his tale of how life isn't fair to *him* what do you think his response would be?  He alludes to it when he says criticism of the Henry tale amounted to the social justice crowd jumping on him.  (And, as an aside, I think some of the anger you see towards ""nice guys"" is influenced in part by Henry stories)

&gt; So I think the better parts of feminism and the better parts of the manosphere could unite around something like this, against the evil fringes of both movements.

I think this is an important take away from the OP article and one I wish he had expanded upon more.   I think he could follow some of his own advice.  For instance, he wants women to understand why men are attracted to the manosphere and why they are angry.  He wants us to ignore the more unsavory parts of the manosphere while listening to important truths men need to speak.

If I can get past the 100th retelling of the Henry story, I guess guys can be a little more philosophical about the 100th ""nice guys are dickwads"" story.  And I think it would be helpful if  men wondered whether ""feminists don't believe X"" could be reframed as ""I'm a feminist, and I don't believe X"" just as a way of engaging with people who are trying to be more thoughtful and compassionate.   

But, thanks for a really thoughtful reply to me.  I do think that feminist writings are more widespread in that you are more likely to find them in ""real"" publications instead of just in certain corners of the internet.  I also think ""bad"" or critical advice is more harmful to men because they are expected to be more assertive in dating and courtship at the risk of not having sex or intimacy.  I'm just adding my own thoughts and not necessarily trying to refute or argue against anything you said.

That is my point, he is wrong. His competitor went down because he expended too much energy too soon. What the fuck do you think a race is?

"dl9q30c","From SLC here, and the homeless issue has been bad lately. I mean I can't compare it to other larger cities, but SLC isn't that large geographically, which means you get just about a square mile around the shelter where everyone congregates. I've lived here for just over 8 years, and I've noticed a steep increase in the amount of homeless/panhandlers/drug users (i know I shouldn't generalize like that, but there's absolutely no way to tell who is what without speaking to every single one, and even then a lot of ppl have become adept liars to support their habits). I've seen ppl shoot up heroin and smoke crack while on public transit, as in they're on the light-rail or bus doing those things. I know this has got to be an issue everywhere, but to see it first hand has been rough. 

I used to always give out a couple dollars on my way to work while passing through downtown, but I've become cynical and selfish over the years. I know I shouldn't judge, but I just felt more and more like I was enabling drug use and alcoholism with my hard earned 'donations'.

The hardest part here is that there doesn't seem to be a 'correct answer' on how to help these folks out. I have great respect for the Mayor in this little adventure of his to experience it first hand like that. I know it wasn't easy for him, cause that shit can get out of hand quickly. I have a friend that was simply passing Pioneer Park (a small park notorious for drug use/sales) to pick up his car from the night before. He got bashed in the back of the head and robbed of his phone and wallet. He woke up in the hospital with 11 staples in the back of his head. If he was down there to buy drugs thats one thing, but just trying to pick up his car from a public space and having that happen was majorly shitty. Anyway, I hope we can figure something out that seems fair and compassionate, but I sure as hell don't know what that would be.

I believe our country is very fortunate, geographically speaking, in that we are able to be more thorough in terms of immigration policy. It has definitely been a factor in avoiding the social tensions that have come in some European countries from sudden, abnormally high immigration levels.

As for your second point, I return to my original argument. I believe undocumented illegal migrants should have access to the most basic of services without having to fear deportation (police, fire, healthcare) but *not* non-essential city services. Now, of course for this kind of policy to be sustainable, then these individuals should be contributing in some way, if not through taxes. 

My stance is that our immigration policy should be flexible and compassionate, but never to the point of being unreasonable, and I still think that this falls under that criteria.

"dl0jcts","Pisces midheaven with Saturn close by in the 10th house; Gemini rising with an exalted Aquarius Mercury in the 8th; Capricorn sun in the 8th house. From a distance you seem like an ambiguous, compassionate but industrious guy, and maybe project a lonely soul kind of vibe. The closer one gets the more your Gemini rising is apparent, but it is colored by that Aquarius Mercury in the 8th conjunct Aquarius Mars. I'd say your external mask takes on quite a bit of snark and has a perverse, biting wit. Very keen and observant, but you are hesitant to share your deepest thoughts and observations. A Leo moon in the 3rd house of communication adds a flare for the dramatic and is fun-loving, so more often than not you hide behind that rather than expose your deepest thoughts. Those who really know you see the guarded Capricorn sun in the 8th, which shares space with four other planets in the same house. It might be a stellium, but it's an out of sign one. A stellium is a conjunction of 4 or more planets and signifies a point of emphasis. In any case, your life is defined by 8th house matters, such as things you intentionally keep hidden (secrets), the occult, shared resources, sex, and death (modern astrologers view this as metaphorical, so more like death and rebirth, ie transformation). 

A strong presence in the 8th with a Capricorn sun and some Aquarius personal planets (especially Mars almost exactly conjunct Uranus) feels like you're drawn to some kinky stuff in the bedroom. Uranus and Neptune in Capricorn here adds a bit of detachment to sex and an interest in power play. An Aquarius Venus opposite a Leo moon might reinforce this, but I'm not certain. But sex is either fascinating or extremely important to you. The 8th is more than just sex, though. I wonder if you're interested in economics or banking (industrious Capricorn sun in a house concerning shared resources and other people's money). That might be true with your sun making a sextile to Saturn in the 10th house of career and public persona. I'm stepping out on a limb to suggest Uranus/Neptune here might mean you're prone to debt that seems to creep up out of nowhere. Sun in the 8th might mean an inheritance from your father's side.

Mercury, Uranus, and Neptune in the 8th sounds like you have an uncanny ability to read people. Uranus likes to break free from constraints and societal conventions; Neptune dissolves boundaries and is related to mysticism. You don't shy away from the taboo. In fact, you embrace it. You have something called a mutual reception between Pisces and Capricorn, so they play well together. In this instance, all the planets in Capricorn take on some subtle mystical or spiritual quality, and your 8th and 10th houses are linked. Your career will play a huge role in your life.

In conclusion, your chart feels like you were born to be a psychologist. Your Pisces midheaven with Saturn says you are drawn to a career that would serve to bring structure to unclear or fractured parts of an emotional nature. With your 8th house emphasis you are naturally probing beneath the surface, ferreting out secrets or hidden things in others. Gemini ascendant gives you a communicative nature, and Leo moon in the 3rd opposite Aquarius Venus in the 9th allows you to express yourself with warmth and positivity, so any dark insights you glean can be tempered. Your Aquarius Mercury, Venus, and Mars gives you additional insight and the ability to remain objective when mucking around in others' darkness.

EDIT: Oh, and Pluto in the 6th house of work, service, and daily affairs sextile your Mercury in the 8th. Yep, psychologist/therapist.

There's a high chance you'll end up being even more distressed and confused after having attempted to talk with them - at least this is how it has been for me. 

You need to figure out logically in this point, where could be the kind of people that are tranquil, compassionate, good listeners - maybe older people, maybe people in chruches, therapists. 

Ofc I wished, always did, that my friends/peers would take a moment and try and understand and feel with me - yet even when I tried doing it for them, or when I expressed distress in 7 different ways (from sincere speeches about the pain I experience to vicious kind of emotional manipulation and attempts of guilting them tho show any care), it didn't really change neither influence them. 

It's a painful notion, sure - but as it turns out, other people might be as confused and uncertain as yourself, they feel the pressure, they have their insecurities, they are preoccupied with themselves and their social status - and that all renders them incapable of being, even for a short moment, a saintly father/mother figure we never had. They will very likely want you to stop feeling the way you do (not a bad thing), and will probably say something very useless in attempts to stop you from saying those things (a bad thing).

Some topics are never pleasant to discuss at the best of times, and there is not a way to discuss them without appearing defective in some way. Not that any one could successfully navigate that for you. So they end up as something that you take to the grave.

2. Pretty much ghosted by my social group at University nearly five years ago. This was on account of the fact that they were heavily into PUA, and I was hesitant on the whole idea. Basically, the whole issue (considering this has happened a second time in my life) has made me very reluctant to socialise, and meet new people.

"dkmafxw","Hello!

Sorry for taking a bit to reply, but here goes!

Firstly, I think your writing is great and I can tell that you have a fervent heart for God.  It's apparent through your writing that you love God and want to follow him with all of your heart. You wish that others would have the same heart for the Lord because it is SO much better to follow the true Jesus rather than one of these fake Jesus's. You're careful of the theology you subscribe to and want your beliefs to be grounded in God NOT the needs of your body or personal circumstances. Those are awesome things, and to that I say rock on and keep going! 

If I can offer any helpful suggestions/feedback it'd be this. First off, if you intend to have your article or further writings be read and accepted by more than just people that already agree with you then you will need some tweaking. I can read the whole thing because I agree. But if someone comes into the article without similar views they may be turned off. 

I've done some writing and I've read my stuff or gone back to it and I can see that sometimes I miss the point of why I'm writing. I'm too caught up in getting my point across that I forget who I want to read my writing. I'd want someone who doesn't agree to read it and be encouraged. 

Paul is an awesome example for us if we are trying to write. Paul's letters are strict, we know that. BUT Paul has so many good things to say to the churches he is writing to. ALSO! Paul knew and loved the people in the churches, he discipled them, he built those churches from up from nothing. Not something we can necessarily say we have when we are posting something on an online blog. So while he could speak in his style of writing, we can't do the same in an online post with an audience of people we do not know.

Your points are all great and valid. But you lack reason for why a person/Christian wouldn't want to follow a fake Jesus. These reasons should not be because it's the right thing to do, or they were wrong in the first place, or because they aren't saved if they follow that fake Jesus. But rather because following Jesus is so much better than following a fake version. OR whatever reason you think of. But I encourage you to have empathy, compassion, and encouragement in your reasoning. 

Which leads to my other thought. I think your writing lacks compassion. Obviously you wouldn't be writing this article if you weren't compassionate. But it can come off as authoritative rather than friendly. I say this because people don't want to feel judged by another Christian. They get that enough, and God will do the judging. You can make the same exact points but still have compassion and be encouraging. 

And I think this can be done by adding yourself into the writing. Bring yourself down the reader's level. Showing that you have shortcomings of your own, that you've worshiped these false Jesus's, that you found the true Jesus and it's soooo good. I truly believe that being humble in your own writing will attract people. They want to read the writing of someone who is humble, encouraging, and compassionate. You can do all these while still exhibiting your points.

So make sure to give reasoning why they wouldn't want to worship a fake Jesus. Be compassionate. And show yourself in your writing. Have you worshipped a fake Jesus? How'd you stop? What happened as a result?

Keep writing though!!! Your stuff is great! I hope my comment doesn't come off as rude, I sincerely hope you continue to write and grow and become an awesome writer!

P.S.: I hope this doesn't sound rude or authoritative. I struggle with that in my writing. I just hope the be encouraging to you but to also give some helpful feedback if that's what you're looking for!",1500841086,"they want to read the writing of someone who is humble, encouraging, and compassionate.","encouraging, and compassionate","compassionate",NA,TRUE,"encouraging , and compassionate","encouraging",NA,NA,0
"dklv826","I understand story telling just fine.  

&gt;when shes literally acting the exact same she had before the season 3 finale.  

She's not though, her entire temperament has changed...  
She's still more hot headed and aggressive than Aang, but the point of character development isn't to completely change someone's personality, it's just to improve upon their flaws, which Korra has done, some slight hotheadedness isn't necessarily a big flaw.  
Just look at her interactions with Kuvira at the end, when Kuvira collapses Korra rushes in to catch her. Is that not visual enough for you?  

&gt;The ending shot is even more important because it encapsulates everything the series is and what it considers important. The TLA ending shot is of the whole gang standing as a group looking over the world they just saved from a raised position (generic but impactful its used so much for a reason). While korra final shot is of her with her love interest and no one else about to leave on a date.  

The ending of ATLA is also just of Aang with his love interest...  
The endings of LOK and ATLA are pretty much the same, all of the main characters are relaxing in the same place, then the Avatar and his/her love interest split off from the main group.  
The difference is that the ending shots both have a different meaning.  

Like you said, ATLA has an ending shot where Aang is looking out over the world that he *saved*.  
A visual representation of the end of his journey to save the world, and to overcome his fear of responsibilities.  

LOK on the other hand has an ending shot where she's looking out over the world that she *changed*, the spirit portal is the ultimate visual example of that change.  
This final shot was a visual representation of Korra's journey to find her place in the world, as the Avatar. It shows how far she's come on her journey to become a fully realized Avatar and to find the confidence to make decisions as the Avatar about world affairs.  

Showing is important, but telling can also be important.  
They *showed* that Korra has changed the world, that she has become more confident and compassionate.  
But with her conversation with Tenzin they also *told* us that she's not done yet, that she has much more work to do.  
Which makes sense because a fully realized Avatar is never done, she will fulfill her duty as the Avatar for the rest of her life and will continue applying the lessons that she has learned about being the Avatar.  

It was important to tell us this, because it highlights the difference in Korra and Aang's journeys.

"dkdgdmz","The fact that you realize what you have done hurt other people, although you claim to have enjoyed the kicks you get out of it - if you are taking measures to make it stop, get help and work yourself out, I can see how it can be okay. 

The things that have happened to you are not okay. They never will be. Nothing will change that. 

Sad deal in life is - all the good and bad that happens to us doesn't really entitle us to less or more love and attention. I've learned in life you can't really convince other people to love you and care about you, no matter what you've been trough or how you try to manipulate them into doing it. 

Loving and kindness can only come from a loving and a kind heart - and it comes out of love and compassion, never out of pity or obligation. 

Sitting around hoping for compassionate people to show up, or waiting until everyone else becomes - not going to work out. Tried it for a while. 

The only thing we can do is try to become loving and compassionate ourselves. 

You do not deserve to die. You deserve help, you deserve the knowledge of coping with your terrible life, and you absolutely do deserve love and compassion. 

And the love and compassion you deserve - not for what you have done, and not for what you have experienced in your life - but because each one of us deserves it without extra taxes and suffering. We need not suffer more than other people, nor do we need to try harder to get it. 

Nobody ever achieved love and compassion because they had a tough life or because they manipulated people to behave so. It gives us instant gratification and little neat kicks - but that is not what we really seeks. Just to give you an idea that these aspects of you won't help. 

Only kind and happy people who have their own shit completely together can love and show compassion effortlessly. Their kindness is never really affected by how dark your life was... Nor how you manipulate them... 

For those who are troubled with their own lives - sure they can be loving and compassionate - but we can't really hold it against them if they are running on fumes themselves, struggling with a broken mind and a broken heart. 

Becoming kind, loving and compassionate can be affected by understanding, truly understanding compassion and kindness, and trying your best to practice it. 

It is not easy. And you won't get there over night. Nobody ever did.  

I also hope that some day I will be a good, kind, compassionate person, and that it also catches on to others.

As one of my professors put it, if someone some and is raiding your house and raping your S/O, just sitting around and saying om isn't gonna prevent any suffering. Sometimes action is needed to end suffering. By making sure you are not excessive, I think you can still consider yourself a Buddhist. Injure when you could maim. Maim when you could kill. Kill only as a last resort. It is the philosophy of the martial arts. Violence does not have to beget violence, though there are some who might say that. 

I also often look at MLK and Malcolm X when thinking about this. I feel that they both needed each other. MLKs pacifism was a uniting factor and was absolutely necessary, but if there is no actual threat to those in power beyond a bunch of people holding signs, aka the kind that Malcolm advocated, then the movement will have no teeth and will go nowhere. Even ghandis movement, though nonviolent, definitely made it known that if nonviolence failed, violence would be the only option. 

Finally, in my opinion, to simply sit aside and do nothing is an act of violence in itself. We are all part of this world, and an injustice to one is an injustice to us all. It is the duty of those with the ability to defend themselves to defend those who cannot. There will always be violence, and even if there is an end to violence I imagine that the time that leads to it will be extremely violent and chaotic. Change is painful. Just be sure to follow it up with compassion by not holding grudges and understanding that we are all capable of horrible acts and it probably wouldn't take much for most of us to be pushed to those acts.

"djur7mo","I shall never love again. 

She was tall, beautiful, wise, fierce, and one hell of a lover. She was the woman every man dreams of falling for and dying with. This beauty of a woman was my love and my life; only this time quite literally. I felt it the second I saw Her. My heart finally, literally shed its armor and my vulnerability shone as if it were striving to join the sun in the sky. I felt my God’s touch, my immortality, shudder at the sight of Her, threatening to cave in on itself and destroy my physical form. That is the price I paid for this gift of the Gods; Immortal I shall remain, until love stakes its claim.  

Our eyes locked across the polished marble floor, its sparkle dull in comparison to Her sapphire eyes. Her flowing gown a sweet ivory, Her skin a soft olive, and upon Her curly auburn locks: a gold circlet. The daughter of the king she was, and she looked the part. Elegant and strong; majestic and mysterious; compassionate but firm. It was hard to convey exactly what made Her look so strikingly beautiful, for I do truly believe all beauty is relative to Her. We met in the center of the room, and for a moment it was naught but us, standing beneath the whispering flames dancing upon the chandelier above us, a soft melody playing somewhere near to us, yet sounding distant. 


As we neared I knelt, offering my hand to Her majesty the princess, my heart nearly exploding as she touched it with a soft hand, stronger than I had imagined. Several bangles circled Her wrists, chiming softly as I stood and took Her second hand, bringing Her close. Our eyes locked once more, my stomach fell. My knees nearly betrayed me as Her sweet scent of juniper and summer breeze overtook my senses. 

We danced. 

We danced for a fortnight, celebrating the union we represented; between the two houses, the two kingdoms of the realm. We were to rule in unison one day, after our fathers met the Gods on the field of battle, and our children would have inherited the largest kingdom that one could imagine. Alas this was not to be.

Beauty could not have saved Her; even love couldn’t have saved Her from the bite of cold steel. On the last night of our celebration, after the kings proclaimed the houses united and us the rightful heirs to the kingdoms there was an awakening. In the shadows a dozen men, nay not men, but shadows themselves, moved like whispers into the palace. Apparating in the kings’ bedchambers as if they themselves were smoke from the lit torches, the kings were extinguished as easily as the torches’ flame. The wives were spared, only long enough to release blood curdling screams waking half the kingdom, then they too fell silent. 

I awoke at once; knowing what was happening, reaching under my pillow for my dagger, a gift from my recently deceased father-in-law. It was heavy in-hand, yet perfectly balanced, a sapphire in the pommel, almost as bright as his daughter’s eyes, though not quite. The moonlight fell through the open balcony doors and made the sapphire sparkle as I unsheathed the weapon. It wouldn’t fare against the Apparitions, though it will serve its purpose yet. 

My newlywed woke with a start, clutching at the sheets and questioning the ongoing muffled cries of terror. A sudden pounding at the door made Her fall silent. Again, and again, and again the pounding came, meaning to turn the artistic piece of wood we called a door into kindling for the fire, a fire which they would promptly put out. 

She clutched at me from behind; I can still feel Her trembling as she wrapped Her arms around my waist, meaning to hold me until the bitter end. I turned to embrace Her, to comfort Her, and to tell Her everything was to be fine. The pounding intensified. Not at the door this time, but in my heart. Fear crept over my mind, threatening to steal my courage and to prevent me to do what needed to be done. I looked at the door, the hinges barely holding on to the stone, grasping at whatever they could to prevent the intruders from gaining access. The art pieces themselves began to splinter down the middle as the pounding intensified further. I turned to Her once more, and locked my eyes with Hers. I brought Her face close with my one free hand, having it tremble as it came to meet Her soft cheek. I brought Her lips close to mine and kissed Her, hard. The kiss was of a thousand kisses, meant to span this lifetime and the next. When we broke apart, a single tear had found its way down the side of Her face. Suddenly, the pounding stopped. 

And all at once, the light in Her sapphire eyes went out. 

The door burst open and the Apparitions, *my* Apparitions entered. I laid Her on the bed, arms crossed over Her chest, eyes closed, hair splayed over the pillow, sheets slowly turning the dark crimson of the blood of innocents. I turned to the Apparitions, my hand still wielding the dagger with the sapphire now a dull grey, dripping with Her blood, feeling my heart once more clad itself in the gift of the Gods.

You barely even argued you just used moral pandering as an excuse as to why I should say something that I don't want to, as a matter of fact you even conceded the idea that the only reason to pander to these people is because it's ""respectful"" and ""nice"" and that gender dysphoria is a mental condition. 

My ""opinion"" is that I don't want to accommodate someone who is ""in crisis"" by feeding into their delusion of being another gender because they are not that gender. 

Your entire argument is that I should accommodate them by saying they are a gender that they truly aren't because it's nice and compassionate but what you seem to fail understanding is that I don't care if it's compassionate because it is simply not true and I refuse to normalize the idea of being born in the wrong gender just because you don't wanna appeal to societies gender norms, they are not born ""the wrong gender"" they have a mental condition.

"dj64djj","I will do my best! I am not an expert by any means, and everything that follows is based on my own extensive research and life experiences.  
  
Based on what you've said, it does sound like classic BPD. As far as types of therapy, I have found that Cognitive Behavioral Therapy and EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing) have been the most effective in my treatment. It can be hard to find a specialist who does EMDR, though.  
  
Keep in mind that unlike bipolar or schizophrenia, BPD is not a chemical disorder that can be stabilized with medication. It is a personality disorder, so the personality is what has to be treated, which is why therapy is crucial. Of course, medication can help if the person who's suffering from BPD has other ailments, such as anxiety or depression, but those will only serve to take the ""edge"" off and will absolutely not address the real problem, which is the learned behaviors that your ex is exhibiting. He will need to go to someone who can help him learn correct coping strategies and social behaviors, and ""unlearn"" the ones he is currently using.  
  
BPD sometimes appears alongside another mental disorder, such as bipolar, schizophrenia, depression, anxiety, etc, so keep that in mind too. Sometimes, but not always. It also looks different for every person, though there are 13 classic ""signs"" that a person that suffers from BPD may exhibit. The book I recommended goes into more detail about those.  
  
The problem with trying to get him to understand that he has a problem is going to, 99 times out of 100, prove futile or backfire completely. People with BPD do not see that they have a problem. In their minds, everyone else is out to get them. They are masters of being the victim. Case in point, your ex saying ""I have so much love to give!"" Which implies that it is everyone else's fault for misinterpreting his emotions. He ""can't help it, it's just the way I am. Why can't people understand me?"" This puts it on everyone else but him to deal with his emotions. If they aren't his responsibility, he doesn't have to address them.  
  
As far as other routes, the most effective one for me after therapy was being with someone who absolutely would not put up with my shit. He knew exactly what kind of respect he deserved, and my attempts at ""gaslighting"", ""negging"", manipulating, victimizing, and the like hit a hard dead end every time. When we started dating, he already knew my issues, and he told me that if I ever flat-out refused to get therapy or treatment when I need it, we would be over. I knew he meant it. I'm married to him now, and I know he still means it. This sounds really harsh, and I guess it can be, but people that have BPD need HARD, HARD boundaries. They also really flourish with routines and stability. My husband is supportive but firm, kind but not a pushover, and compassionate but unwilling to let me victimize either of us. The key here is that I dated someone who could handle my bullshit and who was very invested in my treatment. But none of that would've mattered if I hadn't been willing to start treatment in the first place.  
  
Aside from therapy, and having a major support system, there were some small things that helped. Here is a list of some, off the top of my head:  
* Removing people from my life who aggravated my condition  
* Quitting a job I hated and starting one I loved    
* Getting enough sleep  
* Staying away from alcohol and other substances. They have a profound effect on someone with the emotional intelligence of a child.    
* Exercise, exercise, exercise. I can't say enough what a difference it will make.  
  
This is quite a big longer than I meant for it to be, but I hope it can help you. If you take away anything from this, remember that a person with BPD or any health issue will not change or improve until it is their idea to do so and they want to. Until then, you will keep going in circles. They will make promises, maybe even improve for a few days, but these behaviors are ingrained in a person and they will inevitably fall back on them until they learn new behaviors to replace the toxic old ones. I hope this helps you, and it wasn't too long or preachy. These are only my opinions and experiences, so take all of this with a grain of salt, and please consider all your options. This may not even be something your ex has! It's hard to know. But do your research and make the choice right for you. Please let me know if you have any other questions and I'll do my best.

"dj0tww1","I can’t remember a more extreme example of the tension between the short term and the long term than that which the country now faces.

In the short term, almost anything could happen. The Conservatives and the DUP could fall out. Theresa May, despairing at the collapse of her reputation, could resign. Equally and on the other hand, she could sack Philip Hammond if he breaks government policy by making his planned speech calling for Britain to stay in the EU customs union.

Because of the Grenfell Tower disaster, the Chancellor postponed and did not give this speech at the Mansion House on Thursday night. But we know what he would have said, because a leading article in the Evening Standard that morning – mistakenly assuming it would be delivered as planned – told us its contents.

George Osborne, Mr Hammond’s predecessor as Chancellor, is the editor of the Evening Standard. By jumping in early, he disclosed the Treasury’s ploy. Every day just now, similar games are being played all over Westminster. For the long term – but at the same time – we are deciding the future of our country in the Brexit negotiations. They start on Monday.

I am grateful to an acquaintance who has introduced me to the word “zugzwang”. It is used in chess, to mean “a situation in which the obligation to move in one’s turn is a serious, often decisive disadvantage”.

Most Conservatives think they face a zugzwang.

Thanks to the shocking election result, they feel forced to move: end “austerity” (I use inverted commas, because the Government is still borrowing £100,000 a minute), soften Brexit, change their leader – something, anything!

Their situation is certainly grim, and could get grimmer.

After September 16 1992, when John Major’s government was forced to take sterling out of the European Exchange Rate Mechanism, having staked its credibility on staying in, the economy quickly improved. But the moral authority of the government collapsed, leading to a series of ignominies.

This week, Mrs May looked bad on her visit to the scene of the dreadful fire. Jeremy Corbyn looked good on his.

It reminded me of the aftermath of the atrocious Dunblane massacre in 1996. The prime minister, John Major, and the leader of the opposition, Tony Blair, visited the stricken town together to put aside party differences.

Mr Blair emerged as compassionate, but poor Mr Major, despite his genuine personal empathy, was afterwards misrepresented as the leader of the pro-gun party.

Nowadays, in the age of social media, such humiliations speed up and intensify.

Until the campaign, Mrs May’s shy awkwardness was seen as evidence of her authenticity; now it is taken as proof of her coldness. Thanks to Mr Corbyn’s Trotskyite trolls, there will be much, much more of this. On Friday, the BBC virtually incited the mob led by extremists that converged on Kensington Town Hall.

Equally certainly, the situation is precarious. One Tory MP this week told me, in the same sentence, that Mrs May was “a completely broken human being” and that he wished her to continue as leader. The psychic health of the tribe is not good.

But what if, in relation to Brexit at least, the Government faces no zugzwang?

Last year, 17.4 million people voted Leave. That stands. Next, we must thank the Remain crusader, Gina Miller. By forcing the case about Article 50 in the Supreme Court, she precipitated a vote in the House of Commons. Although heavily pro-Remain, 494 MPs out of 650 then voted to trigger Article 50. Leaving the EU became law. The process is in train.

This month’s election did not change that fact. Nor did it show that the voters had rejected Brexit. Both the Conservative and Labour manifestos supported Brexit, and nearly 85 per cent voted either Conservative or Labour.

The fervently pro-Remain Liberal Democrats dropped slightly, achieving only 7.4 per cent of the vote. If Brexit was not mentioned much in the campaign, it was more because people assumed it was happening than because they were trying to reverse it.

Now David Cameron and Mr Osborne, Sir John Major and Mr Blair, Nick Clegg and Peter Mandelson, and the Financial Times and the Treasury (who think they have proved that membership increased our EU exports by 75 per cent and “therefore” Brexit will reduce them by 75 per cent), also fanned by the BBC, all find themselves agreeing on an exciting compromise delivered by a new political consensus.

Funnily enough, that compromise would involve ceding elements of the control of borders, laws and trade for which we voted. Funnier still, President Macron, Wolfgang Schauble and Guy Verhofstadt have started hinting that our departure, which we had previously been told was irreversible once triggered, could now be reversed after all.

The behaviour of all the above is entirely understandable from their point of view, but in no sense whatever is it intended to strengthen David Davis’s right arm as he enters the Brussels negotiating chamber on Monday.

The political reasoning behind finding that consensus is supposed to be that the Government will otherwise collapse and deliver us up to Marxists. But why should Mr Corbyn stay his hand against a Tory Government which compromises on Brexit? He will quite rightly continue the job of opposition, which is to oppose; and anyway he is the longest-serving Brexiteer in the House of Commons.

Even more to the point, what’s in it for Mrs May? Just now, her most tenacious supporters in her party are the Brexiteers. Getting Brexit done is, as she has said all along, her job. If they decide she is not doing it, that is the end of her.

Most to the point, the only certainty in all this is that no sane Conservative MP wants another premature general election (though yes, I admit, the traditional link between the word “sane” and the word “Conservative” is coming under strain).

The Fixed-Term Parliaments Act makes it harder than in the past for a hung Parliament to provoke one. If the Tories play their cards right, they could be in government for the next five years. If they play them wrong, they could be out for the next 15.

Rarely has there been a stronger incentive for them to be good boys and girls. If they face no zugzwang, they need make no move. Better to struggle loyally on until the House rises in late July and then go away and lie down.

Obviously, Britain is weaker than before we voted. Obviously, some concessions will be made. One, already flagged, is to guarantee the rights of EU citizens already here (and hence of ours there). Another might be to pay a higher financial price. Once a deal is made – and not before – transitional arrangements may need to be secured.

There should also be a change of tone here and abroad. The Government should involve British business instead of insulting it.

Towards the Continent, it should be friendlier and simpler. The point about no deal being better than a bad deal is not to seek no deal, but to show a bottom line. What we want is a free trade deal with the EU, and for that we should ask politely, since it is up to them. If they don’t want it, we have the WTO fall-back.

The alternative the Remainers are pushing is not an agreeable consensus, but a betrayal of the biggest vote for anything in our history.

"dj0h4f7","I feel the exact same way as you do about the trolling thing. I'm sick to death of it and feel totally jaded. But there's so many posts where I honestly can't tell if the person is doing some sophisticated trolling (which does happen quite often here and in many other LGBT subreddits) or is being genuine.

My philosophy with those is to, as you say, give the poster the benefit of the doubt, while remaining cautious. I think it's really important to do that because, as you say, there are a lot of very vulnerable people here, and many others who are new to all of this and/or are conflicted or struggle with internalized transphobia.

I only personally draw the line when someone seems to be advocating against a few core factual principles against which there is no reasonable argument to be made. For me, these are the legitimacy of trans identities, the reality of gender dysphoria, and the medical necessity for (and effectiveness of) transition in treating gender dysphoria. These are all things about which there's a very strong (and extremely well-supported) scientific consensus. Pretty much everything else has a lot of wiggle room for legitimate argument, but this stuff just doesn't. It really doesn't.

"diufzx6","This may seem to be an unrelated story, but I hope this gives some clarity to anyone who is unsure of how they could handle a situation like this.
When I was a child, my siblings and I had a malamute named Winston (after Churchill). One day we let Winston out to do his thing in the yard. He never really left our property; the few times he wandered he would return in less than 20 minutes. On this abysmal day, he vanished. We drew up posters and distributed them throughout our town, hanging them from every lightpost and stop sign. After about a week of no news, we all just assumed that he had been hit by a car or something. I was heartbroken.
Two months or so after coming to the conclusion that Winston was no more, my parents allowed us to purchase another dog. My father installed a fence to prevent the potential of our new puppy following in Winston's footsteps (or pawsteps so to speak). The new dog was a German shepherd that we affectionately named Teddy (after Roosevelt). 
The next couple of days were uneventful. I consumed myself with training Teddy tricks and housebreaking him.
My siblings and I were walking home from the school bus stop probably about a week or two after acquiring Teddy and entered through our back door (closer to the bus stop and both of my parents worked so everything else was locked). Upon entering the house we were not greeted my Teddy's stupid puppy prance. Rather, I heard a muffled yelping and whining coming from the front door. Fearing the worst, I carelessly threw by school bag on the floor and sprinted as fast as I could to the source of the noise with my brother and sisters in tow.
When I reached my puppy, he was desperately pawing at the front door. He seemed uninjured, but I was skeptical of what was on the other side of the door. As I opened it, I was greeted by the friendly face of Winston, sitting patiently on the porch. His tail was going wild, but waited for the command 'come', just like he was trained to. His fur was coarse and nappy, his face was dirty, and he looked noticeably skinnier,  but I was brought to tears while receiving my old friend back into his home. I can only imagine the Homeward Bound style journey he must have endured.
Now my parents had repeatedly said that they were unwilling to let us have more than one pet at a time, so my sister washed Winston up and I fed him before my parents came home. We brought him down to our (mostly finished but climate controlled) basement with a bunch of toys (that did not make noise) and played with both dogs until we heard the garage door begin to open. Knowing that my parents, for the most part, never went down there, we figured this was the perfect location to hide our dog.
We would take turns checking on Winston while the other kids would distract our parents and were careful to keep the dogs separated (the puppy would get excited and make noise, thus endangering the whole operation). We fed Winston his normal two meals a day, snuck him out to use the bathroom (or the dog equivalent of the term), and maintained a surplus of water in a huge plastic bowl taken from our mother's cupboard. We would toss a tennis ball around the basement to get him as much exercise as possible and brush him daily. At dinner, my sisters told our parents that they thought Teddy was lonely and begged to be allowed a second dog. Our parents were compassionate, but strict. They flatly rejected the idea.
We kept the secret for a few days, but hiding him was growing difficult as my parents began noticing us slipping away. One thing that we hadn't accounted for was the water softener. It was located in our basement, but rarely needed any attention. On this occasion, a blockage or salt bridge had formed and the softener was no longer doing its job. With our parents both working (our father working 60+ hrs a week) and caring for 4 troublesome children, they would normally just hire contractors to do any labor at home. Well, the water softener dude came and we knew our jig was up. There was silence for a while, and then we heard the contractor trudging up the basement stairs. He didn't say a word about Winston til he was halfway out of our front door. It was as though it was an afterthought. He turned to our father and said ""By the way, sir, that is a very well behaved dog you have down there."" Our father quietly grinned and replied, ""Yes. Yes he is.""
After closing the door behind the contractor, he turned and chuckled at the looks of terror on our faces. ""You really thought I hadn't noticed that Winston was home?"" he said laughing. He added, ""I knew the moment you asked for a second dog and all made eye contact at dinner the other day.""
Apparently our parents would go downstairs after we were all in bed and play with Winston. They understood the situation and how complex it must have felt for a group of kids. We thought we were clever, but our parents taught us that day that we weren't. 
Now the point of the story is NOT to cheat or any other derivative thereof. The lesson is that sometimes in life we face complex situations that force us to make difficult choices. In these moments, we tend to focus on the problem, rather than the support may have from our loved ones. Any person who truly cares about your happiness will at least attempt to empathise with your situation and approach you with compassion, rather than selfish motives.

Things culminated recently when I took her to one of her first softball practices and asked for her fidget spinner so she could get going on the field. Fast forward 15 minutes later and she's standing in the parking lot, screaming her face off and bolting every time I step toward her. Now I'm in a situation where I need to get my kid, and I know she's got the tunnel vision of rage and is likely to dart into the main part of the lot.

It sucked. Having to pick up and struggle with a raging 7 year old at the softball field in front of a ton of parents that already think I'm an absent mom (work full time, Dad and I share custody) was brutal.

"digrv5v","Hi! I'm so sorry it's taken me this long to reply. I wrote a letter and left it in my parents' bedroom at night so they could read it in the morning. I figured that doing it that way would allow them to read and process the information at a pace that suited them (which sometimes can't happen with face-to-face conversation). 

I wrote my letter in a few different sections. 
(1) Background/context about my mental health journey 
(2) Explaining anxiety and depression (symptoms, what they are etc)
(3) How the illnesses affect my daily life and how its led to me coping via self harm
(4) Explaining why I wanted them to know and a few adamant reminders that none of this was their fault + a few practical things they could do to help

I guess my advice for you would be to think about the reasons why you want to tell them so that those desires can be clearly expressed when you discuss this with them. Try and think about your parents' context and level of understanding as well- my parents don't have any background in understanding how mental illness works, so I tried to explain it in ways that would make sense to them. I also had an immense amount of support from my friends and that helped a lot. I had one really close friend be a 2nd set of eyes and re read it after I finished writing. I think finding some support as you think about how to go ahead with this would be super helpful too. Lastly, prepare yourself for a less-than-desirable response from them...I feel really blessed because my parents surprised me and were overwhelmingly supportive and compassionate, but I know that sometimes concern can come across as anger or something else less palatable. Just know that your parents love you and it might take a while for them to understand. The fact that you want to tell them in the first place makes me think you already have some level of trust and love there!

But with Victoria becoming a new teen looking for romance, the twins Aaron and Jackson rivaling for their parents' affection, and little Olivia learning more everyday, will they have the time and energy for another baby?

The Wilcox Family: Single dad Van is an aspiring writer working hard to raise his two daughters to be responsible and compassionate. But his oldest, Isabelle (child) is more interested in making friends and practicing than studying, and toddler Violet is a wild child who always keeps him on his toes. Who has time to sit down and write a best seller when you're doing it all on your own?

The McCarthy Family: Elliot and Julia just want their family to be happy and healthy, and so far, so good. Their child Amelia is a sweet tomboy who helps clean up, does her homework, and is making lots of new friends. But Elliot and Julia have just told her that she won't be the only child anymore... how will she react?

The Coustier Family: Currently the most affluent family in Willow Creek, the Coustier family is a multi-generational household in a beautiful mansion. But what you see is not always what you get. While the home looks pristine, there's a lot boiling underneath. Child Dimitri flies off the handle at the smallest provocation, child Giselle just wants everybody to leave her alone, and Rosalind clings to her parents every chance she gets. Dad, Kenny, is a lazy jokester who just wants to be friends with his children. Whitney, on the other hand, rules with a strict hand. She's ambitious and driven and thinks her children should be ""seen but not heard"". Throw loving grandma Judith, always the mediator, into the mix, and something is bound to break.

The Hayes Family: Sara Hayes is a recently divorced, single mom to teenage daughter Amanda. While she was once a stay at home mom, she aims to enter the business career to provide for her family. She's always thought she'd be a great CEO, but her ex-husband didn't believe in women in the workplace. Amanda is angry that her dad is gone and blame her mother for their tiny house and shabby belongings, and rebels at every turn.

The Henley Family: Lorelei Henley would give anything to be a mother, but it's never quite worked out for her. As she rapidly approaches adulthood, she fills her free time with endless partying and men, hoping to fill the void she feels inside. While the right one stumble along, or will Lorelei have to take a good look in the mirror in order to make her dreams come true?",1496100151,"the wilcox family: single dad van is an aspiring writer working hard to raise his two daughters to be responsible and compassionate.","responsible and compassionate","compassionate",NA,FALSE,"responsible and compassionate","responsible",NA,NA,0

"di2c8oo","I understand your frustration. 

A lot of people are really just afraid of changing, I am assuming that you are in your twenties like myself, a lot of people have been consuming animal products for a half a century. To go from all of that to suddenly having to admit that there is something wrong, unethical and unhealthy about your lifestyle and culture is a very big step. It is going against your parent's moral teaching, your friends, the mainstream.


People are afraid that it will be difficult to change, they are afraid to give up their comforts, some people live to eat and do not know what alternatives there are. They fear having to learn how to cook from scratch after decades of doing things their way. They associate memories with their favorite foods and can't imagine that they can have a large impact alone. They have cognitive dissonance and often do not realize the fallacies they are faced with. Some people are just dicks who do not give a wet slap about the suffering of other beings  but I tell myself that they are in the minority.


I think it is important to be compassionate but firm. Never shield these people from the truth, because the truth is irrefutable, but be mindful of their situation and experiences. The more people we can convince to give up their bad habits the better it will be for the animals, this planet, and our culture. That is why we need to be understanding even when we feel anger and indignation, when we are tempted to yell we must remember what the stakes are and adapt to the person we engage with. Don't compromise your own morals but do your utmost to have an impact on their way of thinking, that means not pushing them away.

"dhu1iim","When Lieutenant General Asaraki Hiro(AKA the Great Dragon of Northern Japan), a very charismatic and compassionate but headstrong and intelligent officer in the Imperial Army of Japan, was in command of the 4th Imperial Army Infantry Division, he led the 4th Infantry Division through the First Sino-Japanese War against invading Imperial Chinese troops all the way to when the Red Corpses started showing up.
(The Red Corpses are zombie-like creatures that are slightly stronger than their former human self and a foot taller. They also possess glowing red veins, and the only only way to kill them is to decapitate them or shoot them through the neck, which will kill them). 

On August 2nd, 1898, Lt. General Asaraki orders the surviving members of the 4th Division(8,000 soldiers survived, with 7,500 dying to either Chinese troops, the Red Death/disease in general, starvation, thirst, or the Red Corpses themselves)and any surviving units of the Imperial Armed Forces of Japan(IAFJ)to rendezvous up at the last safe city in all northern Japan, Kobanki City. 

Lt. General Asaraki, being literally the highest ranking personnel in all of northern Japan, orders all military engineers and anyone with proficient skills in smithing, to help construct a rifle that can help save thousands, possibly millions, of lives. After seeing over 350 of his soldiers die in 30 minutes to the hordes of Red Corpses, he wanted to arm his men with a rifle that can save people. 

On October 17th, 1898, with literally hundreds of hours poured into developing a new rifle, the Asaraki Rifle/Proto-1 was developed. 
When a massive horde, estimated to number over *35,000*, started showing up at Kobanki City(the civilian population numbered at 14,000, while the military was estimated to have around 13,500 total soldiers)the alarm was raised. With the Asaraki Rifle/Proto-1(commonly referred to as the Asaraki Rifle by soldiers)being ""issued"" out to every soldier, the Battle of Kobanki City commenced.

The /Proto-1 rifle, being only a disassembled and(heavily)reconfigured Murata rifle, had some to little hope placed on it by the frontline troops. While the /Proto-1 rifle proved to be somewhat proficient on the makeshift test ranges, it hasn't been through the landscape of war. At first, the rifle proved to be a disaster. Jams were commonplace, sometimes the muzzle literally blew off due to it being a semi-automatic rifle, etc. However, after some military engineers found a small flaw in the chamber system, it changed everything from that point on. All soldiers were required to fix their chambers, and soon enough, the rifle did fine. 

After a solid week of fighting, the vast majority of the Red Corpses were dead. Of the total population of Kobanki City(including military personnel(27,500)), 2,900 civilians died and 8,450 soldiers died in total. By the time the the last shot was fired, the vast majority of /Proto-1 rifles were damaged to a certain extent. But, the new rifle design changed the shape of war against the Red Corpses. 

A week later, an emergency fleet of IAJ airships arrived. Everyone was evacuated south, and the new Asaraki Rifle will now be the standard issue rifle to all and every soldier and future Trooper to help reclaim Japan.

And grief is not a process that has a clear beginning and ending.  The process of returning to a somewhat normal life takes different amounts of time and effort for everyone but I can assure you that 2 months is not long enough.  

  My SO lost her brother 3 years ago and that first year was an emotional rollercoaster for her, but also for me.  She tried to talk to our counselor early on asking what she needed to do to get through this grief process as if it was a 10 step program that she could complete and get a certificate to hang on the wall and then she'd be fine.  Our counselor was great, very compassionate but also blunt when she needed to be.  She said there's no process, grief is not linear, and focusing on a getting through a grief process takes the focus off the fact that her brother was gone.  After that came some kind of acceptance that this is not something to quickly work through so that life will return to what it was like before, because it won't.

"dhk3nqe","&gt;I actually don't think slavery or murder are objectively wrong - it's possible to imagine a case where they are the lesser harm. 

But murder, by definition, is an unjust killing. So if you justify it, is it actually murder? And if it can't be justified, then is it not objectively wrong? 

And how about slavery? In what scenario would that ever be ethical? 

&gt;For example, if I had to murder someone or everyone on the planet would be killed then me murdering one person seems clearly preferable and therefore the right choice to make in that situation.

Would that actually be the right choice? You'd have to prove that it's justified to intentionally cause harm to one person, to save multiple people.

I think that's a hard case to make. You're still infringing on one individual's right to life and causing them unnecessary pain. 

If you want to argue that causing pain is only justified if it's for survival, that's fine, but then that wouldn't fit the definition of murder. And thus, murder would still be objectively wrong.

I was constantly trying to end things because of how we fought, and how much it stressed me out, and how little he was changing how he addressed in those fights. Inevitably, we'd talk over a meal, or have 'one last' conversation when we went to pick up stuff from the other person's house, and then decide we weren't done. 

It's never as simple as one person being the victim, and one person being the abuser. I think we both mirrored really unhealthy behaviours at each other, and it meant that issues were actually never resolved. 

When we fought, or when he brought up things that bothered him, I asked him to give me an example of what he meant (so that I could fully understand what kind of tones he wanted changed, or what specific behaviours I had in certain situations), and he couldn't provide examples. And so, I'd say, even with no examples, I'll try to correct that behaviour in the future, and you're allowed to gently point out when I'm doing it, so that we both know. 

He was always the one to yell first. And it wasn't always a 'fight'. A lot of times it was just me 'disrespecting his time' when his expectations hadn't been communicated to me AT ALL. He would get really agitated when I would want to pop into a store, or grab a bite, or something that didn't line up with his plan, and then claim that I never respected his time. Now, I am a chronically late person, and there are patterns and behaviours that I can work to address. But the types of fights we were having around those kinds of things were not healthy fights to be having. 

When I saw the merit of his argument (aka when he could properly communicate things), I always made an effort to work through things, and to make sure I understood how he wanted things changed, or addressed. But honestly, some things were just so controlling that I pushed back because your partner shouldn't be asking you to change behaviours unless *it is hurtful to them*. (He would tell me that my burping after drinking soda was gross, and that I shouldn't do it...that kind of stuff). 

I am not trying to victimize myself in this situation, because I certainly could have been kinder and more patient and more compassionate, but emotional burnout is a thing, and I moved home to help look after my dad from across the country when they found a tumour in his brain, and I needed more support from my partner, who just kept demanding more things from me... 

It was an impossible situation, and it's finally over. And I sort of know that those bad habits were not originated from me, but I didn't work with him to correct them, as a couple. I can be pretty sure that I won't be taking those hurtful behaviours forward with me, because of the work I'm doing to fully understand things...

A good therapist will also ask you to identify your needs and goals for treatment during an initial session. They should allow you to speak to your own problems and perceptions when you are asked. They should ask you about your personal history and your medical history.

Not wrong, but I’d argue it’s a mis-attribution on your part.

You are looking for someone to love who will love you. A close to universal human desire.

For you to love them there are attributes this someone must have.

And, because you are a member of a profoundly marginalised and vulnerable GSM-group, your personal safety looms large as a ‘must have’ attribute.

This not to say personal safety isn’t a must have for everyone. But there are lots of people for whom this attribute is so easily and (mostly) safely assumed they never think to list it when asked or even when thinking about it themselves. (Side-note: it’s no practical help, but I’m both sad and angry on your behalf that you can’t think about loving and being loved without having to also worry about being assaulted and worse.)

The mis-attribution is in conflating ‘man who is bisexual’ with ‘man who I can safely be vulnerable and open with’.

I understand why you are doing this. As you note yourself, you believe that

&gt; bi/pan/trans guys (and women of course too) [will] be more open and
&gt; accepting of dating transgender people.

And that’s a reasonable belief. Being marginalised does, as it turns out, tend to make people more empathetic and compassionate.

But, while there is a strong correlation between marginalisation and compassion, one is not automatically the cause of the other.

There are bisexual men without much in the way of empathy or openness to them. And there are straight men who’s openness, compassion and empathy is a deep and real as anyone’s.

A statistical survey and analysis would, I suspect, support your thinking. The sort of compassion and openness you (quite rightly) require is going to be more common among bisexual men than straight men.

But statistical analyses tell us things about a population, not the individuals within it.

And we meet, and court, and fall in love with the individuals, not the population they are part of or the cohort they belong to.

I’m not suggesting you don’t work to keep yourself safe. Transgender people face violence from both intimates and strangers at levels terrifyingly out of proportion to their numbers.

I am suggesting that you don’t completely cut yourself off from the possibility that a kind and loving bloke who happens to be straight might just be the right person for you even as you just might be the right person for them.

One beneficial side-effect of looking for partners with this in mind: it makes your ‘I would not want him to feel fetishized’ concerns a non-problem.

Honestly? I don't even think it's even a fear of rejection. I think for a lot of men it's a fear of success. Most men in my age group don't know if they want to get married. They feel like they should want to get married, but are often surrounded by older men who slave away at their high paying jobs but can't seem to afford their basement apartment because they spend every penny fighting an uphill battle in an unjust system to gain more than a couple weekends a month with their children. 

Sex is risky considering that a man can suffer if he doesn't get consent, but consent is retractable, inadmissible and unverifiable. 

So men live in this world where they get rejected 9 times out 10 and that 1 time of success comes with an immense amount of risk. Why bother? Women aren't worth it.

The goal was pretty clearly to ask for what you want, and don't settle for the wrong result if you don't get it.  But coming from an industry where a lot of the time my clients *don't know what they want...* it's hard to take the lesson at face value.  A portion of my job is telling people that their vision is only possible at double their budget, or if we meet their budget it won't be anywhere near as pretty.  EX: a man wanted glass panels for his pyramidal greenhouse, but didn't want a steel structure to support them.  100% aluminum in the size he needed to hold up the glass was going to go way over budget, even with some corner cutting, and wood or plastic wasn't strong enough.

The construction pony here did what he knew, he built a boxy wood frame structure in a very short time.  Fluttershy could have repurposed his skill towards building multiple smaller structures with open faces to serve as shelter, but she turned him away entirely.

Interior design pony couldn't have much input for Flutters' original design, and his talents weren't very suited to Fluttershy's purpose.  Perhaps Fluttershy could have used the designer's eye for colours to make fancy birdhouses, or an area of the sanctuary that looked like the desert to comfort the animals from that climate.  Again, no attempt to reconcile the different skillsets.

Wrangler was pretty cut and dry though, she knew cages and transportation, not what Fluttershy needed at all.

The episode did do a pretty good job of framing the situation of ""my contractor did something I didn't want! but I didn't tell him not to do that..."" which is an honest quandary in most walks of life.

"dh4b1xs","Should I give my boyfriend another chance? (self.askgaybros)

submitted 17 hours ago * by qbdkusoemv

My boyfriend and I have been together for several months, though it feels much longer. When I first met him, I was going through a very rough patch. He listened to my every word without judgment and gave me a shoulder to cry on. He showed interest in my life, took me out to dinner and a movie and treated me like I was special. He even threw me a birthday party. When we began dating officially, I felt like I had hit the jackpot. Not only was he kind and compassionate, but extremely handsome, charming and well-respected, far out of my league.

Things started to go downhill when we moved in together. He began nitpicking and finding fault in virtually everything I did. His temper also began to flare up more commonly, and worst of all, he began cheating on me. When I finally worked up the courage to confront him about his infidelity, he socked me right in the face. (I admittedly could have been more conciliatory). After our argument, he apologized profusely and promised to never hit me or cheat on me again. Unfortunately, he has not kept his promise.

Yesterday, I caught him cheating on me again. This morning, I told him that it was the final straw and that I was moving out. He fell to the floor and begged me to give him another chance. He brought up all the good memories we’ve shared (and there have been many) and said that I shouldn’t throw that all away over his mistake. He even promised to attend couples therapy and anger management classes. He was pleading with me with tears in his eyes, and I just didn’t have the heart to turn him down. I told him that I’ll think about it, and he's been texting me ever since to try to talk again.

What should I do? Should I forgive him? I really don’t want to be alone again but I don’t know if he will ever remain faithful to me. Even though we’ve had some nasty fights, we’ve shared some wonderful memories, some of the best ones in my life. I never felt worthwhile until I met him, and I fear life without him. I’m torn. Please help.

Edit: I'm soliciting advice, not baseless accusations and attacks.

It fucks up his relationships and family events sometimes, and something he needs help with if he wants any chance of a long term and healthy relationship. But that's it.

3. Tom is completely aware of how he comes off and how his comments and behavior makes you feel. And he searches out instances to do this purposefully. Tom is being an asshole and may forever be an asshole. Only you can decide. But fuck that noise, personally.

4. Tom knows details regarding the death of your family friend. You should try to get as much information about this as possible while protecting yourself.

Gilderoy Lockhart, reputation in tatters after the revelations of his fraudulent nature, makes a new start in lucrative Memory-Charm-related contracts with Muggle multinational corporations. That's when the aliens signal their presence and Lockhart is finally put to the test of unifying world leaders against them through memory modifications. Likeable and compassionate but misunderstood Lockhart with a human heart who regularly brings us to tears is a bonus. 

***

Story is a bureaucratic thriller set in Grindelwald-era Britain during the 1920s, and follows Reginald Rookwood, fresh out of Hogwarts, fresh into the Department of Records, noted for his ability to wandlessly cast spells through his nose, who by coincidence (or fate) becomes Head Junior Unspeakable at the Department of Mysteries. The central plot is a newly-made prophecy that seems unimportant at first, but gradually grows to concern the entirety of the wizarding world. The points of tension and conflict is Rookwood's frustration with getting anything done, the hierarchy of the workplace, the mystery of his Department, getting away with things he normally wouldn't be able to as an Unspeakable, and the enormous amount of paperwork involved. His work involves ""creative prophecy fulfilment"", that is, finding word loopholes in order to exploit prophecies to their best. A conspiracy is uncovered that the Ministry of Magic is a creation of the aristocratic class to occupy non-aristocrat wizards with pointless work, and nobody apart from the Unspeakables really does anything. Oh yes, and there's a romance in there too. Look for inspiration in Max Barry's *The Company*, Catch-22, and The Trial. Should be extremely fast-paced and generally in the comedy genre.

Muggleborns and those living outside of the wizarding world (including Harry) are prevented from entering Hogwarts or knowing about magic at all until the age of 15, severely crippling their magical education (this was started by the purebloods to widen the disparity between them and the Muggleborns), but this has the interesting effect of making these children more susceptible to powerful outbursts of accidental magic.

"dftabvo","Hi, new to the sub and Overwatch in general. I'm a sucker for lore in games(I spent more time in The Elder Scrolls games reading books than fighting enemies), and the backstory of Overwatch really piques my interest because, essentially, it's all optional content.

I think it's really awesome that Blizzard gave us lore fanatics a cool world to explore while also letting the players who just wanna shoot stuff get down to business. 

So far, my favorite part of the lore is Mercy's character. She's portrayed as sweet and compassionate, but there's something dark about her IMO.

&gt;""Perhaps once the new King of the Ants is born that one will take a more hands-on approach to ruling and also enforce a more reasonable and results-based mindset which is not quite compassionate, but maybe more understanding? Making things easier for Ants like Colt."" ""At least I have full faith in Gon and Killua emerging victorious from their trial"" ""Wonder how Gon's gonna get himself out of this bind"" ""But I haven't lost faith! Killua must prevail, and so he shall.""

Ahahahahahaha... haha... ha... about that: *WHAT. THE. FUCK.* 

The long-awaited King is a little shit who starts off his life by telling his mother to shut up and fatally wounding her. He even looks menacingly full of himself with his set mouth, eyes, freaky helmet, and the tail... I never thought I would feel bad for the Queen, but no loving mother deserves that. *Then* the King decapitates Peggy and orders Colt to clean his friend's blood off. What. He even beheads the turtle trying to defuse things, then eats Peggy. STOP TRAUMATIZING COLT! All that while his mother is bleeding to his death. Thankfully the Royal Guard arrive to lead the King to his meal. Colt pleads with Pitou to heal the Queen, who drops that the Royal Guard's loyalties only lie with the King - the now unnecessary mother means nothing to them. Stone cold. Explains why she kept Kite for herself with no second thoughts. Poor Colt has no choice but to approach... Netero's group?

The King's motions with his stinger tail seriously creep me out. Showerpoof's fabulous wings with those hearts and background flowers are a different matter though, mm. Youpi, having spontaneously grown wings for fun, could learn a lot from him. But back to the action, the King has a hunger for the taste of Nen users that makes me worry for the future of all of the characters. And after being unsatisfied by plain meatballs he's already out on his first trip...

Oh would you look at that cute little kid! I know the drill by now. There go her parents' heads. Pitou with the solid zombie advice about the brain being the most delicious part of a human. So next the King's stinger pierces the kid's heart and his teeth crush her brain. Then he tries to kill Pitou for offering knowledge he already knows. Pitou quickly regains her composure, while Showerpoof on the side is just calmly not looking. Ok, I'm trying to pass over this, but the kid's befuddled tears in the face of the inevitable got to me. As before, the King comes off as such an uncaring dick.

The King reveals that he enjoys the moments before eating, when the human's rareness is unclear. I take that to mean both the hunt and fight, like a certain clown magician. Second case in point, Pitou earned his respect by surviving a blow meant to kill, so he also values strength. Yup, I'd definitely compare this aspect to Hisoka - though a lot of other Ants also share those views.

In the Nest, the Ants have already fallen apart. The majority of them depart to slaughter, eat and build their own kingdoms, leaving behind only the few loyalists unable to stop them. The consequences of mixing all those species' genes into these Ants and the rise of individuality. But this is extremely bad for every living being if they're allowed to spread, because apparently even Chimera Ant soldiers can breed with other females (I thought they were genderless... how does it work for e.g. Zazan? Futa?). Many more queens and soldiers can be born. And not a single one of those Ants striking out on their own is fit to be a king. The world is fucked.

Upon hearing that tale, Morel and Knov decide to let Colt meet Netero. Out of pragmatism I assume he will hear Colt out and let him live for any further value he may have, but even if he decides it's best to keep the the Queen alive I doubt his squad has the necessary healing power. After that, I wonder if Colt can continue working with humans. Surely he can't feel anything but hatred for the King and the other Ants who left. And unrelated, I take some comfort in the fact that I got Knov's bet correctly... now let's see the actual results!

Aha, 4 of them got out of the truck. But - THE CAT ON GON'S SHOULDER! *Fucking what?* Now he can't fight for an entire month. He has to ask Knuckle to save Kite. Knuckle is the one with the full token and he and Shoot enter NGL. I want to ask what happened, but the frustrated anguish on Gon's face says it all even without his words and the flashback. At times I may have disliked his stubbornness, but seeing it come to nothing at such a time is incomparably worse... even if it may be the lesson for him to learn here. Killua's blank face tearing up hits even harder, his inner conflicts and the ultimatum Bisky left him with are very regrettable now. Cue the music...

NO. This is the worst possible development! Their friendship is one of the most precious things in the show. How is this happening? Last episode and all the ones before I've been 100% sure of Gon and Killua showing up when necessary and always sticking by each other. There have been so many meaningful moments like the ""You are light"" scene... that already had that foreshadowing before Bisky's lecture. Fuck. 

I wish to predict that it will all be resolved before those 30 days are over, but I have no idea what would help restore Killua's confidence or make him reconsider. A serious threat to Gon that would make Killua want to keep an eye on him even once he's regained his Nen? If they don't leave the island yet, could the King and the scattered Ants offer that? I won't entertain Gon and Killua truly separating before an eventual reunion. Even though I love the thrill of emotions and this episode totally hooked me off that alone, it would cross a boundary. But I think a part of me now believes HxH could pull it off... only, will the heartache be worth it?

Phew, a bit late with this behemoth. I swear that's all now (edit: after ""some"" trimming). Despite - or rather, because of my current feelings on the King and Gon&amp;Killua's loss + looming break-up, I have to give major props to Togashi for his writing. I would never have expected the main protagonists to lose their pivotal fights with such severe consequences. I've barely watched shounen, but this has to be exceptional for its genre, right?

"dfm1d5t","A handful of people hold more wealth than half the entire human population.

Note the tone of this piece.  It's factual, compassionate, but very careful to avoid declaring what is.

You aren't crazy.  There really are major league problems.  There really is enough to do better by our people.

Know what this all is?

Fuck it, I'm a gonna just say it this morning:

Global coup.  The end of the industrial revolution is past us.  Know what boot strapping means?

In computing, this is the hard manual work of writing the code needed to run other code that can build the code needed for a new kind of computer to join the ranks of existing ones.

Once this is done, the computer is self hosting as are it's tools.  Other computers are not needed.

Another way to see this is landing on an island.  We build things to build things, eventually build advanced things.  What happens when we cut down all the trees to stay warm?

In terms of technology, humans, the world, we are completing the bootstrapping of our species onto technology, ending human labors, abandoning hunter gatherer type behavior and dependence.

Once done, a great many humans will not be needed.  Think about that.  You can bet your ass, literally, they are and have.  This unbridled wealth is a survival of those who believe they are the future.

Whether that is true is a great debate, but a side show for now.  Meritocracy isn't just a trend.  The ones at the top right now are fully invested.  Why?

Because most of the world hates them, or will soon.  

These times, us as people, are seen as the end of an age.  Our opponents believe this purge of culture, politics, nationality, values, people (literally) is a necessary step in our overall evolution and survival.

Fewer and better humans are the future, bolstered by the massive product of our collective labors to get here.

Their answer is another great expansion.  Get off the planet, seek resources off world, go boldly forth, leaving this time behind.

Tons of money is being poured into cheating death.  Private efforts to reach the stars are afoot.  Robots are making robots now.

FANUC has a dark facility.  No humans needed for very long periods of time.  Full replication.  Today.  Much more exists that we don't know much about.  We don't need to know.  Relics.

I just want you all to think in broad scale.  This is us or them.  And for them, they see it as us, or the future of humans.  Just know that.

Way up top?  They don't fucking care.  Really.

Yes, there is enough to do right by people, live in the now, be good beings, live, love, play, build, do.

These asses want more.  They want to transcend.  Post human, post old world, post US.

I once had a brilliant conversation with one of these types.  We agreed to break the rules and just chat for days.

They said to me:  There is simply not enough.

Now you understand why.  Trump is selling us today, a pivot to a future that does not include most of us.  

Keeping these people happy means unfettered economic freedom.  For them, and their place in the world, that is all that matters.  

They want to actualize a future they believe possible, they have the wealth to try, and they don't care so much about the risks and costs, because they believe they will have options.  They see themselves as the best of humans, destined to take the species somewhere new.

Many see it as necessary for our survival.  We get off the rock, or perish as we lack what it takes when we use too much for the ""wrong"" reasons.

To understand this, think about oil.  Right now we have it.  We have had it.  Oil brought us an age of industry, technology.  Oil is our means to boot strap our race onto something greater.  It's our shot.

When it's gone, we will be left with lesser means for real and for good.  

Now think about our history without oil.  What would we have done.  Would we even have much of what we do today?

Many do not believe we would.  Other believe we would have different things.

But, we have gone this way.  No going back.  

A look at fossil fuels from a sustainable standpoint is easy to understand.  Solar, renewable sources, all cam power what we have built and it can do so reasonably.

But doing that won't bring the power needed to escape.  This is all there is for a very long time.

Fine by most of us.  Not fine by many of the ones with such economic power.  Governments get in the way.  Will of the people, they see as ignorant people, get in the way.

We aren't needed any more.  That's the vision we face.  

Do I believe that?  No.

But I also know the last 200 years has seen a tech expansion like no other.  We live in interesting times.  Our world is small now, known, a constraint.

Read on singularity, ""the great filter"", post humanism.  We struggle against people who nearly completely reject this world and who want an entirely different, merit based one.  If you get it, and you can contribute, you are in the club.

If you don't, or can't?

Just an expensive resource or legacy burden to deal with.

This struggle runs to the very core of who we are as beings.  Some of our very best attributes are clashing with norms, culture, humanity and all it means.

Post humans are goal oriented.  Survival of the race.  No time, no resources for dead weight that could doom us to a subsistance type existence, trapped on the rock for our own folly. 

There is a lot of other thought out there.  Seek it to understand better.

But know, this fight is for all the marbles.

Whether we need to take this shot at expansion now is highly debatable.  Forget that.

It's all about that we technically can.  Know that too.  Huge risk (us dying basically, struggling economically, environment thrashed), huge reward and the mother of all legacies.

And you would have reacted the exact same way if one of your male friends had done this, right? You're trying to portray yourself as just being tired and confused and compassionate, but you were only comfortable letting her do this because of your past physical intimacy.

to speak. Joyce, mother of John's three children, unfolded the letter
she'd prepared for the meeting.

""Dear John, my dear John,"" she began. ""I am the only one who loves John
the man. Everyone else loves John the god.""

For almost two decades, Joyce de Ruiter had watched her husband take a
magic carpet ride from humble shoemaker to this -- a god figure in a
burgeoning new religion, worshipped by hundreds in Edmonton and around
the world.

A book carries his byline; videos and cassettes his voice and image.
There's a Web site -- www.johnderuiter.com -- and a schedule of where
he's speaking each week, be it in Toronto or India. Upwards of 300 flock
to weekly Edmonton meetings, many of them newcomers who moved to Alberta
from other parts of the country or the world to be near John.

But late last year, Joyce discovered a side to her husband she'd never
suspected. It had prompted her to intervene, in front of his followers,
with this written plea.

""My sweetie. You are not god, you are not deity,"" Joyce said that
evening. ""You are a normal man who has been seduced by power and adoring
women.""

Devotees shifted quietly in their chairs as John stared gently at his
wife.

""You are sleeping with two of your disciples,"" said Joyce, ""and you
can't recognize how far off you've gone. Sex with Benita and Katrina is
not truth.""

John's face betrayed nothing, Joyce says. The audience was like
flat-calm water.

When Joyce finished her plea, John spoke a few soft words about truth
and ended the meeting. Inside, Joyce mourned, as a few of her husband's
disciples came up to hug her and tell her they admired her honesty. She
watched him leave, without her.

""I was God's wife,"" Joyce says sardonically, looking back on that day.
""The Messiah Chick.""

Only four years ago, John de Ruiter was an obscure guru with a
negligible following. Even back then, though, he was known to his
devotees simply as John. It was always ""Come meet John.""

Newcomers would ask John endless questions, and the answers came after
long pauses or sometimes not at all.

In those early days of his ministry, John was supported financially by
10 or so backers. It allowed him to leave his job as an orthopaedic
shoemaker to become a full-time spiritual teacher. Some of these
supporters literally saw him as the Second Coming.

As word spread, John was travelling to New Age hot spots in the United
States, Holland, Germany, Australia and India.  Next, converts in those
places began moving to Edmonton so they could attend regular meetings
with their new teacher.

Hundreds attend meetings these days. John says that one day a new space
will be found or built to handle even bigger crowds. How much room does
he think he's going to need? ""I just know that it will get big,"" he
says.

Benita von Sass knows it looks bad -- an enlightened man, a married one
at that, taking two lovers. ""I would have thought it was strange, too,""
she says, trying to look at it from an outsider's point of view.

But this is a new reality she's experiencing. The old rules no longer
apply, or apply the same way to John, to her or to her sister Katrina.
""I can't define this. I can't come up with a clear argument to justify
myself. I'm following what I know is true and doing what I know is true.
I have nothing to prove or apologize for.""

When asked, Benita confirms she's in a sexual relationship with her
spiritual mentor. ""I have a full bond with John,"" she says.

Does her sister?

""Uh-huh.""

But what about the relationship between sisters? Any jealousy?

""Absolutely,"" says Benita.

How do the sisters work it out?

""A lot of discussion, for sure.""

How does Katrina feel?

John and others describe her as emotional, quiet and compassionate. But
she didn't return calls.

Benita, meanwhile, says she has nothing but respect for Joyce as John's
wife. But she says Joyce, in her heart of hearts, knows that John,
Benita and Katrina are not being licentious. ""What I know is that John
is ... goodness and purity personified. I'm in love with love.""

""John has never replaced Joyce,"" she says. ""He loves her absolutely.""

If John went back to her?

""That would be awesome.""

A friend of Joyce de Ruiter describes Benita von Sass as one of the most
beautiful women in Edmonton. Her Rapunzel hair reaches her waist, and
her eyes are deep as an August sky.

Benita has a maiden's soft skin and a litigator's stride. She drives her
car fast. Her voice is soft and rhythmic.

Every one of them -- John, Joyce, Benita and her younger sister Katrina
-- are beautiful, with varying shades of blond hair, blue eyes and
physical grace. Joyce says that when John first explained Benita and
Katrina to her last November, he talked of having three ""wives."" Now he
doesn't talk about wives anymore and instead refers to permanent bonds
or bonds of being.

Others might call it infidelity or immoral. John's followers? Only a few
walked away from the group when the controversy broke. It's difficult to
find anyone who is openly critical of John, though some are confused.

"df681xj","I think sometimes people may know/think they know more than yourself about the dairy/meat/egg industry and they think they're okay with it, which for them justifies their consumption of said products. 

Case in point, I'm vegan and have been for a long time, and veggie before that. I grew up in an agricultural part of the UK so I both know from seeing it and know from research that imho the dairy/meat/egg industries are ""bad"" and inherently exploitative. However my partner, who apart from a severe nut allergy will eat anything, is very pleased with himself when we discuss that he's essentially 95% vegan because of me, but enjoys being able to have options when he goes out to dinner or to see his family or whatever. Through knowing me and now living with me, he knows that it is ""possible"" to be vegan and healthy​, to feel full, to eat junk food. He also says he knows what I mean when I talk about eg dairy being exploitative. We got in to an argument recently because I'd seen a post along the lines of ""veganism is for mothers"". All I was trying to talk about was the base philosophical argument, the feminism and the exploitation angle. I was merely working through the argument with the ""why?"" game, rather than stating I agreed with it. However this was too much for him and it left a salty air in the room. 

However I don't doubt that he is a compassionate person, I don't doubt his commitment to my veganism - eg finding somewhere we can both go out to eat, having food in the house we both eat - and I also don't doubt that on some level he does think the way I do about animal cruelty. 

But I also don't berate him for not ""seeing the light"" or going 100% vegan because I am not going to force a choice on him, and forcing ""choice"" with emotional blackmail (like slaughterhouse videos) is far more reprehensible than someone reaching that point themselves.

He defends veganism as much as I do; some friends tried veganuary and essentially gave up because they found it impossible and pointless. He was the first to point out to them that they are criticising my way of life, which is hurtful. 

So in conclusion objectively you could say ""how can someone who does know all the facts still be a compassionate but non vegan person?"".

These conversations you describe I think are happening all over the place.  The major problem I've personally seen has been that they're just passive and inactive conversations that, ultimately, try to make people seem ""intelligent,"" but end up being practically useless.  

Personally speaking, if comes down to knowing where to grab the sympathy of your audience.  Where to expose their weakness.

For someone on the conservative end of the spectrum, it starts with actually starting where you agree, and then bringing out the compassion part of it.  Most people aren't actually horrible at all, and I suspect are far more liberal and compassionate.  But you have to bring that part out in some way.

The more liberal end is a bit trickier because it often starts with a sort of ""absolute justice"" kind of feeling.  But the problems on this end tend to be that it's all talk.

"dewwrtg","Wow.  There is so much wrong in that statement that I'm literally going to have to go line-by-line to unpack it all.

&gt; The problem is that pretty much all arguments against Islam can be said against any other major religion

Not even close.  Even if we were to just compare Islam with Christianity (probably its closest Western analogue), the differences are so immense that it isn't even an accurate comparison.

For one thing, Christianity was a reformation.  It took the violent, warlike, old-world beliefs of Judaism and reformed them into a more modern, peaceful set of religious beliefs.  Islam has had no such reformation.  It still exists in the violent, warlike mindset in which it was created.

For another thing, Christianity is a religion.  Islam is a system of government.  Literally written into the Qu'ran is a little concept called Sharia Law, which outlines how you should run a society under Islam.  What laws you should have, how you should treat dissidents, how you should seize power, etc.  This along makes them incomparable.  Christianity, at its core, is *de*scriptive.  It *describes* how you should live.  Islam is *pre*scriptive .  It *prescribes* how you should live.  If you disobey the precepts of Christianity, the New Testament says that you'll go to hell.  If you disobey the precepts of Islam, the Qu'ran says you should be killed.

Even at the core of the texts, they're incomparable.  You cannot possibly compare the Biblical depiction of Jesus to the Qu'ran's depiction of Muhammad and come away thinking Islam is superior.  Jesus was, in the lens of the Bible, what every man should aspire to be.  He was caring, compassionate, but also firm and principled.  He was gentle &amp; forgiving with sinners, yet stern with his followers.  He was humble, virtuous, and uncompromising.  Muhammad, on the other hand, raped a 9-year-old girl, murdered countless people, and his last words were essentially ""go kill all the Jews.""

&gt; Which makes me think the focus is too much on religion rather than culture.

The problem is that Islam bleeds into culture, because it is a prescriptive religion.  It tells you that you need to ""spread Islam by the sword"" to anyone who isn't already a Muslim, and that they should be subject to your Sharia law, too.  You cannot separate Islam from Islamic culture.

&gt; So you get people saying that Islam is bad or incompatable with Western culture or shit like that.

It absolutely, 100% is incompatible with Western culture.  Western culture is based on the principles of liberty, equality, the consent of the governed, and freedom of expression.  Let's break down how Islam is incompatible with each of those beliefs.

*Liberty*: This one should be obvious.  Just go ask any atheist living in an Islamic country if they would consider themselves ""free.""  Go ask a gay person living in the Middle-East if they have ""liberty.""  Under Islamic law, there is no such thing as freedom.  Islamic law says that if you are gay, you need to be killed.  If you are an apostate, you need to be killed (unless you pay extra taxes to the Islamic government).  And that's not even **counting** the sex trafficking of little girls and boys that goes in *ever single day* in Islamic countries, and is completely accepted by their society.

*Equality*: This should also be a no-brainer.  Under Sharia Law, a woman's word is worth half that of a man's in court.  Women can't leave the house unless accompanied by a man, they must remain covered at all times in public (to one degree or another), and if they're raped outside of marriage, they're considered adulterers and executed.  Go ask Ayaan Hirsi Ali, a woman sold into marriage under Islamic rule at the age of 14, if women are equal in an Islamic society.

*The Consent of the Governed*: This is one of the most important principles of Western culture, and one that's unfortunately misunderstood by much of the millennial generation.  Simply put, the government rules with the consent of the people it's governing.  It must constantly work to not intrude on its citizens' freedoms, or they have a right to overthrow it in an armed revolution.  In addition, this principle states that the government does not have any authority over people who do not have authority over it.  To state it another way, if you don't have any say in the government's affairs, the government can't have any say in your affairs.  Now, contrast that with Islam, where it outright says that Sharia Law must be spread to everyone on Earth, and enforced with the sword, regardless of whether or not those people are Muslim.  Clearly, this flies in the face of Western principles.

*Freedom of Expression*: This kind of ties into the rest of our examples, but of all the Western values we've talked about, none is destroyed under Islam quite so thoroughly as freedom of expression.  The idea that you can say what you want, do what you please, associate freely with whomever you choose, doesn't exist under Islamic law.  If you speak out against Islam, you're going to be jailed or killed.  If you associate with people whom Islam deems ""undesirable,"" you're going to be jailed or killed.  If you do something that violates the tenants of Islam, you're going to be jailed or killed.  This principle is completely, 100% incompatible with Islam and Sharia Law.

&gt; They forget that there are over one billion Muslims who each have a unique faith.

What the hell are you talking about?  I'm talking about the core tenants of Islam as outlined in the Qu'ran and the Hadiths.  These are literally, black-and-white, what Muslims believe.  Every single thing I've said is backed up by the actual text of the Qu'ran.  If any Muslim you know says they don't believe in these things, they're either A) lying to you, or B) not practicing Islam properly.

Listen, I'm an atheist.  I have a vested interest in not allowing Islam to spread to my country, because Islam outright says I should be killed.  It says my gay friends should be killed.  It says the women I care about should be treated as chattel.  I refuse to let that happen.  There is nothing wrong with fighting against another culture, especially when that culture is as barbaric and vile as Islamic culture.

Often, people want things from me, as well. They want to be associated with me, because they feel it gives them a degree of 'transferred celebrity'. As if I am one because of this, lol. Something else people want from me is to hear from me, pure and simple. They want to see me there, see my replies, interact with me... and I think that's perfectly okay! But sometimes it becomes a little darker. They begin to want to challenge me. Goes back to earlier, people calling me a liar. Some people want notoriety or fame for ""debunking"" me in some way or another. As if I'm not who I say I am, or what I said didn't happen, etc. etc. 

Some people want me to give them answers I don't have. ""Did you see the mayor?"" they want to know. I was a child and I was a particularly secluded one... I have no idea who the mayor was or what he looked like. They want me to put things into chronological order their adult minds can understand. They cannot conceptualize the difficulty of doing that from a child's memories. 

They want to understand. They want me to tell them why these crazy buggers did what they did. I can give some suppositions, but... I mean... I was a child. Even as an adult, do they really think I understanding the thinking of a savage monster barely fit to be called human? How am I supposed to answer that? I do my best, but ultimately... *shrug* 

People want me to remember details like phone numbers and addresses. I doubt I ever even knew them! Besides... I was a child. They seem to think that if I remember addresses or phone numbers for 30 years, THEN I'm believable. I don't get it, myself.

Sometimes it seems like people want me to bring them in somehow. Draw them into the experience and make it more real for them and more personal. Of course, it's ultimately unsatisfying because there's such a limited facility to be a part of something so long ago, so distant, and so finally impersonal. No matter the level of intimate details, people still go on with their lives and cannot be truly drawn into it as many wish. 

I believe, related to the above, many people want to fix it. If not fix it, they want a ""happily every after"". When you were rescued, it was better, right? They want me to tell them that it can be okay, that it worked out, that everything was fine. They want to say the right words that make it okay, that makes it feel like everything worked out. It's hard for them to accept that my mother is gone and cannot be replaced. That parts of my life will always be incomplete.


Which comes to another point. Older people want to replace that for me. ""Well, I'm your mother now"". Not one of them, ever, have lived up to that. It is their sincere desire to do so, but I am not their child and, however hard they try, they cannot love me with the unconditional love they have for their own children or adopted children with whom they have history and memory and bonding. However strong their desire, they eventually see the parts of me that have gaps and forget the parts of me that are good. It's natural and I don't blame them (well, okay, I eventually get over it :p), but it simply shouldn't be said or attempted to begin with. My mother is dead. You are not my mother. That's the hard, cold reality of my life. It cannot be fixed. Ever. By anyone, no matter how well meaning. The desire to fix it for me or somehow help is compassionate but misguided. It's past and unless you have a time machine... 

So yeah. These are a few of the issues of being who I am in this situation.

"devgyon","&gt;In the 1960s it was seen as female empowerment.

Sort of but that is not the reason why catsuits came into fashion in post-TOS trek. The catsuits were absolutely not a statement of female empowerment, they were there to up the sex appeal. 

&gt;""I am woman, hear me roar."" Burning bras, wearing miniskirts that barely cover the bottom of their ass, that sort of thing. 

Let's rearrange this thought a bit to show why it's wrong. 

*I* am woman, here *me* roar. 

Great!

But the women on trek did not choose the catsuits, a writer, producer, TV exec did. Those people were almost entirely male.  No woman was given the agency to direct her choices, either in this world or in universe, up until Jellico paradoxically removes Trois theoretical in universe decision to wear the catsuits and thus makes the writers see her differently and write her better.

It's a great statement on how things like that can subtley alter our perceptions on how a person should act, and change our behavior toward them. Troi is *never* written as a ditzy know-nothing. She's always clever, insightful, and compassionate. But put her in a regular uniform, and *now* that clever, insightful compassion becomes decisive, urgent and motivated. 

Troi changes drastically. The writers imbue her with interests she never really showed before. She is now *commanding* others, and doing a great job of it, all while balancing what would be extra difficult tasks to an actual empath. Imagine ordering someone to their deaths *while you have to feel the emotional impact of that death directly from the sacrificed crew member and the friends of that crew member*.  

Troi was startling in her change! 

Later trek writers managed to avoid Troi Part 2 when they created Kira, who also wore catsuits but was never really made to be all that sensual and emotive. Troi was water and air, Kira is all fire and earth. Hell, even the color palette reflects this probably conscious decision. Trois catsuit is curved, smooth, soft and pastell. Kira is angular and red, but it's still a damn catsuit. Some of Kiras best moments were when that catsuit was off, and it's just a breathable and easy to move in undershirt where she gets shit done because she's a fighter and no clothing should get in the way of her doing important shit.

Now let's move to Seven. Seven was really problematic, on a LOT of levels. The doctor designed something like a sex robot for himself, and molded her into a sex partner. It didn't work, but a lot of the weird romance they tied in later was a really gross writer fantasy. Sure, it's intended to show how frail and childish the doctor is emotionally but having this all done while she's wearing a pointless catsuit was grating from the start. Despite this, Seven was written as strong.

Yay Feminism?

Nope. 

Seven was written strong because she was written without much humanity. Her femininity was on display but was not really a part of her psychology.  I don't buy into the idea that men and women hare vastly different mentally, though obviously there are some differences, but the writers gave us a character who was basically genderless but happened to be large chested and wearing skin tight outfits all the time.  I still loved her, but I wish she'd been put into something not obviously designed to get male viewers more interested in strong women. 

Remember, Janeway being the captain caused *death threats* to be sent to the studio. It was kind of a big deal.

So we come to:

&gt;Then feminism changed and now it's seen as exploitative.

This veers close to implying that somewhere in there the rules changed. 

Well, sorry friendo but they never did.

A woman, or *any person* choosing to throw on skin tight clothing because they like it is great. A woman, or any person, dressed up in a sex suit to provoke a positive sex reaction from an audience is not empowering. It's pandering.

Let's not muddy the waters by implying that the trek writers in any way were trying to make a feminist body image statement with Troi, Kira, Seven, or T'Pol.

"dess0dv","&gt;History has shown that one of the few solutions this sort of problem (an area of land no longer capable of supporting life) is migration to areas that can support life.

History has actually shown that famine is not synonymous with environmental conditions. In fact, a negligible number of modern famines have been caused by land no longer being ""capable of supporting life."" You're assuming that the areas outlined in the article are being struck by famine because the land just suddenly can't grow food anymore. While the probability of such events increases with most climate change models, we shouldn't assume that's happening here. 


&gt;Migration comes with risks and issues both short term and long term. The short term is the issue of finding an area capable of supporting millions of refugees, Most areas capable of doing so already have millions of residents.

Again, migration isn't an implied consequence of this situation as an inevitable result. If the situation is not rectified, yes, we will see refugees- provided that the effected people can do so, physically.


&gt;The long term issue is one of integration. History has shown that for an immigrant population to become accepted by the host nation is for them to blend in a bit. Any culture that is secluded and separate becomes ""The Other"" and is attacked.

Your average post in our sub, garners about 6-8 posts in a hour.  A post like that would be immediately sent for the resource lists in r/domesticviolence by a referral or r/abuse because it's far above  our pay grade. If not by the mods, by our commentariat. 

Part of the reason that it blew up like that, is that it was surreptitiously posted to a regular (not OP) TRP post and it sent their minions running to apologize for him. Then it hit RPMarried when it was a category 5 shitstorm and actually got worse.

We constantly see this kind of trolling from those sources trying to recruit and spread their particular agenda. They will actually troll post, things that gets their people worked up and tell their people about it over there, like bait. Our hive is pretty compassionate, but sometimes gullible, it puts a target on our back. 

Because they *think* that we are a female biased sub, which we aren't. Our rules are applied equally to all genders, sometimes to the point of ridiculousness. However, I think that what they are actually seeing is that because it's got a much higher demographic of females on a server that is overwhelmingly male, the female point of view sticks out more. All gender perspectives are value added on a sub where one gender is looking for more balanced advice. 

A lot of them use sock puppets, because they know if they post in our sub and theirs, we will ban them on sight. *Their* mods go so far as to suggest that to their group. Sadly for them, their neurolinguistics give them away every time. They can't help themselves.

We have to walk a balance, while realizing that there is a sweet spot in an advice reddit. The spot where you have *enough* traffic to be useful, and not *quite* enough traffic to attract a herd of asshats.

"deh2pn8","I'm not operating under first wave feminism, I'm not even a feminist. I used ""patriarchy"" in my comment more as a code for ""men having most political power and masculinity being more respected than femininity"", not as in ""women are oppressed by men"", I'm not a fan of that expression.

My beliefs on gender are that most gender roles are purely cultural and completely made up, but gender identity itself and, obviously, some biological differences are very real and instead of being ignored, maybe we should embrace them. Men are conditioned to be proud of their manhood, but women are more often socialised to be ashamed of it and repress it in various ways and, IMO, feminism only contributes to that instead of opposing it. I see natural childbirth (if chosen freely as an informed decision, not forced or pressured into it) as part of this ""womanhood positivity"", for women to be proud of what their bodies can do, framing this as a feature and strength instead of a flaw or weakness. Maybe this is where our beliefs clash.

&gt; There are expectations which turn into forces that dictate how we are ""supposed"" to be based on our gender roles.

Here's where I disagree with you completely. What's wrong with the ""goddess birth"" or whatever you call it? Isn't it much better than a kind of birth where a woman is a poor passive tortured victim who hates the whole process and is left traumatised by it?

It only confirms my views with what's wrong with modern feminism - it sees women's bodies as inherently inferior, and any sort of focus on them or invitation to appreciate them is seen as making women as ""less of a person"". As well as any sort of sexualisation is taken to mean that women are seen as objects. It seems like this view stems of Cartesian dualism where the ""body"" is completely detached from the ""mind/soul"", seen as only an empty and meaningless vessel. But our bodies *are* us. We spend our whole lives inside them, how can we just pretend that they don't exist and aren't even part of us as ""persons""? Why not to embrace our bodies as they are, instead, learn to accept them, love them and take care of them? To me, natural childbirth is exactly that. It's a challenge that women educate themselves for and prepare for. To me, whether they ""succeed"" or ""fail"" matters much less than the fact that they *tried*. I think the major issue that present the biggest obstacle for natural birth and the potential of enjoyment of it is this deeply ingrained Western cultural belief that failure is unacceptable and objectively bad. It shouldn't be that way. Failure is an inherent part of life no less than success, and most people experience a lot more failure in their lives than success. Failure can teach us a lot, maybe even more than success, if we learn from it. In case of natural childbirth, women who ""fail"" should never be shamed for it, they should still be congratulated for having the courage and determination to try, and they can still have a very fulfilling and meaningful experience even if it ends up being a C-section after all. In the end, *objectively* the only thing that matters is that the mother and baby are alive, safe and healthy. However, *subjectively* the personal experience of birth does matter a lot to most women. It can make the difference between getting post-partum depression or not; the difference of how easily and quickly you bond to the baby, even the difference in how you recover from the process. In my mind, saying that *all* that matters is whether the mother and the baby are alive and physically healthy really minimises and invalidates the process of childbirth which is, to many mothers, something very meaningful on its own, as a *process*, not just for its result. And I think when women wouldn't even consider natural birth and refuse to learn anything about it but immediately go for planned C-section and don't even prepare for any of it, that seems more ""patriarchal"" than anything else, it's like saying ""I know I'm weak and I'm going to suck at this, I have zero confidence in myself so there's no point in trying or even considering this option at all."" How can this be seen as more feminist and empowering to women?

As for expectations... Actually, I always thought that the expectation of ""good birth"" brings women closer to men. Men need to be active participants in their life, take up challenges and perform well in them, this is how they gain respect. This is basically the definition of being seen as a capable, mature adult person - people expect you to be strong and capable and publicly display this capacity. In the most ""patriarchal"" societies, women had no such expectations of performance at all, they were seen as passive objects who don't experience life, life just happens to them. But in many traditional societies, childbirth was for women as war, hunting or sports competitions were for men. Women were given help and support but they were expected to be strong and brave and perform well.

Does this view have downsides? Of course it does. In all societies, men who failed to win their challenges were shamed. I'm not advocating that women who ""fail"" at natural childbirth get shamed. So I'm not fond of the idea that natural childbirth should be publicly expected from women... but maybe there's nothing wrong with an expectation if there's no shaming followed when the expectation fails? As I said, in any society adults have certain expectations faced on them. If nobody ever had expectations, i don't think we would even have survived as species at all. Regarding childbirth, what if we change the expectation from ""succeed at natural childbirth"" to ""learn more about your body, prepare for this physical challenge and meet it with courage and determination no matter how it goes?"" That sounds much more healthy and more reasonable to me. We all know that childbirth is not something we can ever have full control over. The only thing we can control about it is our own views and reactions. That's the principle of Stoic philosophy - we can't control life (and childbirth, in a way, is a symbol of nature and life itself - something that can't ever be fully tamed and brought under control), but we can choose our outlook.

&gt; Women are expected to have no self actualization beyond spawn.

Again, this only confirms my views on how feminism divorces women from their bodies, because it sees women's bodies as the ""enemies of personhood"". All women are first *people* and only them women. Yes, giving birth is undeniably the greatest thing that a woman can do *as a woman*. Because it's a unique ability that only women's bodies have, and one of the biggest physical challenges that women's bodies can go through. Why don't we congratulate it instead of scorning it? When people choose to run a marathon, they get cheering and support and get a medal in the end. They don't think it's the only meaningful achievement in their life, but they do think it's one of them. Interesting how different interpretations can be, isn't it? I could even go as fas as to say that *your* view is the more ""patriarchal"" one. Instead of respecting women's bodies, you put them down as meaningless and unimportant.

As I said, women are people first and women second, just like men are also people first and men second. First and foremost, we're all people. Why do you see womanhood and personhood as polar opposites? Why do you think that giving birth and finding it fulfilling and meaningful somehow makes a woman less of a person, or means that she can't also achieve other things in life?

&gt; Gender is a societal construct (much like the superiority of the natural birth or the rules of tag).

I agree with all what you said here, all those are purely social constructs. There's absolutely no biological reason why girls should like pink more  than boys or why they should be more compassionate. But what does giving birth have to do with that? It's most certainly not a gender role, it's the number one biggest biological difference between men and women.

&gt; This conditioning continues and changes form as girls grow older. 

Yes, I agree that women should not be pressured into having children. But this seems to getting further and further from our original debate... If a woman chooses to have a planned C-section instead, do you see this as fighting against gender roles, is that why you're so opposed to natural birth? This makes zero sense to me. Deliberately choosing to go against gender roles solely for the sake of going against gender roles seems just as dumb to me, as following gender roles just because you think you have to. And I think modern feminism has started to go overboard with this - instead of encouraging girls not to follow traditional feminine gender roles if they don't want to, and embrace the masculine roles if they do want, girls are now being outright shamed if they choose to be ""feminine"" instead, and traditional femininity is being derided by feminism, instead of brought to an equal level with traditional masculinity. Ever since I became a feminist at 13, I was conditioned to believe that everything feminine was inferior and in order to be respected and equal, I had to ""be like a man"". I thought being compassionate and nurturing or wanting to have children was lame because it was ""feminine"". Took me a long time to get over this and ""get in touch with my feminine side"" or whatever I should call it.

Seriously, why don't we just let people be people? If a girl wants to play with cars, it's alright. If a girl wants to play with Barbies, that's also alright, because *Barbies are not inferior to cars*. This view is also a social construct. If a woman doesn't want to have children, that's fine. If she does want to have children, that's also fine because *having children is not something lame or inferior just because it's feminine.""",1488574169,"i thought being compassionate and nurturing or wanting to have children was lame because it was ""feminine"".","compassionate and nurturing","compassionate",NA,FALSE,"compassionate and nurturing","nurturing",NA,NA,1

"dea4aeo","Yeah, I agree. To me, the fact that she has flaws and they're not game-ending is important. I think acting like she's so much worse than Barry is wrong, but so is acting like she's a saint next to Barry. They're both compassionate but selfish people, and Kara in particular was brought up in at least one relatively toxic environment, if not two. It makes sense that they would have some trouble doing the right thing for certain situations.. and honestly given what we know about Astra's marriage and how normal and unremarkable Kara seems to find that toxic pile of shit, it makes sense to me that she has no idea what's healthy in a relationship in particular. 

But she doesn't get a free pass to be a jerk just because she's the protagonist or just because she's a woman. Mon-El is no peach, but she was abusive to him just as a friend and mentor long before he stared playing this possessive boyfriend game. I thought the show was going to have her finally accept him for what he is and him find a way to incorporate notions of heroic responsibility witih a life that isn't a hero's life. Instead he gets to be a shitty, patronizing version of Kara's dream guy to her shitty, condescending version of herself as his potential girlfriend.

They do *not* belong together, but they can't belong with anyone else until they both check some problems they have. Everyone's ragging on Sanvers and shit, but Alex and Winn are the only people on the show who've made enough progress with their issues to have healthy relationships. They've both come a long way since season 1, Winn in particular. Kara is backsliding, and I think that'd be great for the story if they'd just deal with it for what it is and not make it out like this whole ""if he can't accept me at my worst he doesn't deserve me at my best"" shit. God, what a simultaneously true and toxic sentiment that is. 

My fear is that he will turn overtly abusive and she'll be made out, rightly, to be an innocent victim with no attempts to address her toxic behavior. Not communicating perfectly doesn't make you deserve abuse. It doesn't mean you had it coming, and a narrative that deals with abuse shouldn't do that. But it's too hard not to make it look like you're condoning abuse and too hard to avoid triggering genuine victims watching to deal in nuance. If one of them turns abusive, the other has to be an innocent victim. And the only way I can see for a narrative to get something constructive and character change out of that is for someone, probably J'onn or Cat, to sit Kara (or Mon-El) down and talk about how often victims come out of abusive relationships having picked up toxic scripts and patterns from an abuser, and how it important it is to work on those to protect yourself and your future happiness. But even then.. Kara's problems don't stem from Mon-El at all. She was the one who came out the gate with toxic behavior here. It's just that his toxic behavior does show signs of getting much worse faster.

The fact is that people who come from environments full of trauma or abuse, even really subtle emotional abuse, are way more prone to abusive relationships later on. Mon-El's homelife sounds like a total shitshow. Kara's Kryptonian family shows some signs of having well-concealed, socially acceptable dysfunction, and it's abundantly clear that one of the doctors Danvers either has a personality disorder or had a parent who did. Maybe the takeaway from this should be that they both need to fix themselves before they can be the show's end game. I just hope we can get there without them turning into Kara-bur and Fifi-el.

When I saw your comment it struck me that you might be in for a rude awakening. I wanted to be compassionate but also funny. 

Given our current climate of political correctness, anyone to the right of Bernie Sanders is a Nazi. The alt-right appeals to ruthless (amoral), competitive, honest white men - and may look a lot like fascism to you. If you argue with them they might easily be rude to you. 

There's a culture of mocking genocide, death squads, lampshades, etc - unless you're a callous thrillseeker, that probably won't be your cup of tea and you may feel like you're losing your subreddit to fascist barbarians.

I guess it is a bit like when the huns moved into Europe - displacing people as they moved in - a natural process, but one that just doesn't feel nice.

A lot of these people would be nicer if they had grown up in the America of the 1950s, 1960s or 1970s. But they grew up in the 90s and 00s in Diversityland, so they'll be nasty race warriors. It is a tragic situation. The upside is you get to see fascism rising again in the most unlikely of places - so now you'll have insight into how it is the most tolerant people of Europe (the Germans of the 1920s) did the antisocial things they did in the 1930s and 40s.

"de28yu2","Its going to be hard. One of the first things to remember is that people love Hogwarts, in the first few books we're surrounded by magic and how fun and yet pointless it can be. Some doors that aren't really doors but just walls pretending, classrooms that move. Doors that won't open unless you tickle them and places that only exist on a thursday. Hogwarts itself is magical so you'll want to capture that. 

Secondly, I don't know about other people but for the most part I dislike reading about other made up magical cultures. Why, because its often done so poorly. We learn little from the canon universe about the other schools. Dumbledore, Merlin and Morgana, the founders, Voldemort etc were all British or came to Britain depending on if you take the Slytherin of the Fenns (Essex) to be his home over the name Salazar which is probably more Spanish. The only foreign magical of note was Grindelwald who himself came to Britain to advance himself. Hogwarts is the premier school of magic. Ignore how bad Defense and History are, Divination too. Fleur and Krum are powerful and talented but their Headteachers felt the need to cheat. Cedric and Harry did receive help from Crouch Jr but we might assume less and far less direct help until the maze by which point they were the points leaders. This all matters because Britain is the home of magic in this respect, the place everywhere else looks to, Hogwarts' library is meant to be the greatest in the world. This makes it hard to read when people try to bash Britain, sure the politics may be backwards but the rest of the world is unlikely to be some enlightened super race who see the British as crazy. 

You have to have a reason for all the changes. I don't mean this as you can't diverge but there needs to be a cause of divergence and a path we can follow. Why wouldn't Harry go to Hogwarts? He's English and its the best school in the world. He's also eleven at the start of the series so not going to be making super well reasoned choices. Hogwarts and Britain has its flaws but make sure your reasoning and divergence is shown not told. If you tell us it sounds preachy and descends into bashing very easily. Along with Bashing their is a fine line walked with many OCs, the mystical and terrible Mary Sue, care that you don't make everyone the greatest and nicest people. Hogwarts is the best according to the books, how do the others compare? What holds them back? Is it the students, the staff, the curriculum or something else? 

Along with a reason for the changes in the story you should have a reason for writing the story. You wanting to write it and enjoying doing so is fine. If you want others to enjoy it though it should have a reason, a plot. What does Harry going somewhere other than Hogwarts provide or are you writing the same story somewhere else surrounded by OCs? Harry Potter is seven books. Each year has its own adventure, there is nothing wrong with having boring years that you basically skip if you do it well so as to advance the plot. A normal school for a normal student isn't nearly as exciting as Harry Potter's time at Hogwarts, there will likely be no three-headed dogs and defense teachers out to get him. You're more likely to hit racism, resentment for the British, why did Dumbledore not save the continent from Grindelwald earlier? Do the Europeans hate each other for their history. France vs Germany is a rivalry that is long and bloody, not as long however as GBR vs France however. Does the Cold war have any effect on the continent's magicals? The conflict that will occur will probably be more subtle that the bogey man that is Voldermort. It can feel forced if you try to have a big end of year conflict every year without reason. 

I'll also throw out some thoughts I had a while back just after I read The Santi's great story. How far would Dumbledore go to ensure Harry grew up humble and away from his home? Imagine if Dumbledore wanted to let Harry have a childhood outside the spotlight. Dumbledore is old, it was only a few years ago James Potter was young and arrogant, the prophecy is still in play and Harry is marked. Could Lily and James stop Harry growing up arrogant and ensures he gets a proper childhood? Now Dumbledore clearly has a screwed up family situation so his decision making might not be sound. If he obliviated James and Lily making them thing Harry died then Harry could grow up somewhere else away from the spot light. When he reaches school age then they can reclaim Harry and guide him to become what he needs to become. He will have had a proper childhood, he will have not had his life dictated by his fame and they'll still gets years together as a family. I don't know about you but I could easily see the Potter's losing all trust in the Headmaster and moving to a school he isn't in charge of. Lily Potter was described as kind and compassionate but James Potter has a history of doing whatever he can for his friends and family without caring about the risk to himself. He might have been an arse to some people but he was without a doubt a man who loved strongly and would do anything for those he cares for. It and his love for his wife are what defines him as a character, don't betray that.

"ddtdyun","So this is a question I have spent a lot of time wrestling over, and it has actually been my own relationship with my daughter that has helped me to start there wrap my head around the idea.

Love begins as a choice, a decision to find the lovable in someone.  Real love is not based on appearance, performance, conditions - it is based on an abiding choice to see the other person in the best light.  Once that choice to love has been made, then it becomes easy to find the lovable in someone.

I love my daughter.  Because she is my daughter, that first day at the hospital, I loved her.  She hadn't done anything - she was just born.  She didn't earn any affection, didn't do anything amazing to woo me; she just was there, and I loved her.  As she's grown, because I love her, I see all these amazing qualities she has.  She's an artist, a writer, a dreamer, a singer, she is funny and smart and polite and compassionate... But that's not _why_ I love her.  Those are simply some of the things I love about her.  She's a good student and good grades come easily.  But, if she wasn't, I wouldn't love her less; I would love the perseverance she shows in trying to learn, even if she's not getting it.  If she was different than she is, there wouldn't be _less_ love, there would just be different things to love.

God loves me because He decided to.  He says that He has loved me with an everlasting love.  In fact, in I John, we are told that God _is_ love - the core attributes that make God God are not His omnipotence, onmipresence, His vast knowledge and power; it is His choice to love that defines God.  Because He has chosen to love, He sees the lovable in me.  He sees the struggles against sin and, like watching a kid try to ride a bike and fall off, He has compassion on the times I fail.  He sees the condition of my heart and, like a parent watching a child compete in a sport, He is cheering me to victory, and sometimes still blessing me with ice cream when I lose.

There are times of discipline, but the point of discipline isn't to crush me, but to give me the skills to succeed.  A good parent doesn't discipline their child to display their own strength; they do it to teach the child how to avoid greater hurt in the future, protect the child from a pain greater than the temporary pain of the discipline.

God's discipline is like a road by a ditch.  If you're on the road, you're fine.  As you start to go off the road, there are those rumble strips, warning you to course correct.  The strips aren't there to damage the car; they are there to remind you of danger more serious.  Past the rumble strips, there's a barrier to keep the car from falling in the ditch.  Hitting the barrier may damage the vehicle, but not as badly as tumbling over the edge would.  If you push past the barrier, your car gets seriously damaged as you fall off.

In the same way, God's discipline isn't the ditch - it's the rumble strip and the wall.  God wants to keep us from hurt, not _cause_ the hurt.  And however severe His discipline may feel, it's always less than the danger on the other side if we keep heading the wrong direction.  He warns us with His word, His spirit, and others in the body, and if we persist, there's often greater pain past the warning, but He's trying to keep us from hurting ourselves.

And, for those times we go off the road, just like if my daughter called me and told me she was in an accident, I wouldn't say, ""Well,  you got yourself into this message, get yourself out."" Rather, my first question is, ""Are you OK?  Where are you; I'll come get you."" God's response to our sin and the pain we bring to ourselves because of it is to come alongside us.  It doesn't undo the damage, but it doesn't change His love.",1487247760,"she's an artist, a writer, a dreamer, a singer, she is funny and smart and polite and compassionate...","polite and compassionate","compassionate",NA,FALSE,"polite and compassionate","polite",NA,NA,0

"ddoprp3","Well that's a question that depends heavily on your worldview. US law and culture has been unequivocally built around a Christian worldview. The Christian response on this is easily summed up in Titus 3:1: "" Remind them to be submissive to rulers and authorities, to be obedient, to be ready for every good work"". If our government has determined that illegal aliens should be removed from our country, and it asks an institution for help identifying them, resisting that directive is morally wrong under a Christian worldview. I should also note that we should look for opportunities to help illegal aliens that are in need, and seek opportunities to be compassionate, but never contrary to the rule of law.

The argument can of course be made that you're not beholden to a Christian morallity, but then the real defining question of the whole argument is from what do we derive our morality and ethic as a university? Deriving morality from your own sense of right and wrong, or from the popular culture, is a dangerous foundation for creating policy that has the potential to affect many students and the university as a whole.

"ddgo17c","I think  F types in general are subject to being people-pleasers even when it destroys us. For instance, after every interaction with people, I go through the entire scenario over and over and over again in my head, trying to remember if there was anything  I did or said that could have been possibly taken the wrong way, or been offensive or annoying on one level or another. I dated an INFP once who, upon offending me, would become irrationally angry and attempt to justify whatever he did or said on the basis that his intentions were good. Maybe they were, but as we know, the road to hell is paved with good intentions. Sometimes you just cannot control how a person reacts to you, even when you do your absolute best to soften any and every possible blow.

This is just a guess, but I'd say maybe you're being too critical on yourself for not being able to coax your professor into being receptive. Not because you wanted to manipulate him by any means, but because you didn't want to offend or annoy him. Do you respect him a lot? I respect my Sifu more than I respect anyone in my life, and every time I say something that he takes the wrong way (we're almost polar opposites, so misunderstandings occur a lot), I internally spend hours screaming and vow to never, ever, ever, ever say anything in class ever again for the fear of upsetting anyone else ever again.

Naturally this is very unrealistic and just a knee-jerk reaction to guilt and shame. It's gotten easier to manage once I realized that not everyone analyzes every little thing the way that I do, nor are people really as sensitive as I tend to think they are.

"ddfzdx5","&gt;Then you likely don't know what sexism is. The whole point of this is that women aren't inferior, it's that they're different. They can do the same things but that doesn't mean they do them the same way or have the same needs. Swapping genders on a lead character would inevitably change the feel of the show, losing a part of its identity in the process.

Again, you're applying broad averages to an individual. A fictional and non-human individual at that. Broadly men and women have differences. But individuals may not conform to the averages so they're utterly irrelevant when discussing a single character. A female doctor can be anything a male doctor can be.

For example *on average* men are physically stronger than women.  But nonetheless many individual women are stronger than the average man. So say we have a tv show where the lead has to be really strong. By your logic a woman could never lead that show, but you'd be wrong because there are strong women out there and indeed the writer can write his/her female characters as strong as they like.

The same logic applies here. Even assuming that the doctor has certain core personality traits which are male associated (which I don't really agree with anyway), there are still women with those personality traits. And because we're talking about a fictional character, the writers can write a female doctor however they like. Whatever personality traits the doctor *must* have to be the doctor, a female doctor can be written with those. 

So what does the doctor need to be anyway? I would say wise, authoritative, adventurous, rebellious, compassionate but dangerous, with a (sometimes challenged) love of humans and a hidden sadness at the ephemerality of the universe. There's nothing male about these traits to me. 

&gt;Declaring it a fact doesn't make it one. I need to re-state this: the media you consume is not indicative of what everyone else consumes, nor what is considered mainstream. Of the ten most watched single episodes of any TV show in the UK last year, nine of them were The Great British Bake Off, a show hosted by women, where the contestants were predominantly women, the production company behind it has a female creative director and managing director and it was won by a woman.

Citing one tv show hosted by women does not change the fact that the mainstream media is male dominated. Here is one such article I found in 30 seconds typing in male vs female lead shows - http://www.indiewire.com/2015/10/breaking-down-gender-diversity-on-tv-just-how-many-women-are-on-broadcast-dramas-anyway-56401/

Type that in yourself and you'll find many more hits. They all say the same thing - men still dominate in the media.

If I was a women, would I want to go to go to a GP for a referral for an abortion as 'I am suicidal' to be grilled by two doctors to see if I am suicidal and then go to a hospital for it. Or go to the UK and have an abortion without being treated like I am a second class citizen? I think I know what I would do. 

The fact is an abortion is very expensive and has a massive impact on your mental health. Most people don't take it lightly and people need to realise that eg the pill free on the medical card versus an abortion that can cost £1000 for the procedure alone

Laws that restrict abortion really only punish low income women. A middle class women on a decent salary will have no problem going to the UK for one. A women on the dole will be the one penalised with restrictive abortion laws.

"ddbnfbh","Born and raised in Minnesota. Moved to the country when I was two. Used to bike all 10 miles into town all the time as a kid, no cell phone, none of that shit. You came home when the street lights came on. That was the best part of my childhood, how simple it was. Went to the local pharmacy for the soda fountain, hung out at the library for the chance to play a new computer game on a random www site (as nerds do), swam in the river in our skivvies, roller rink on Saturdays (they would do overnights sometimes)... You got the picture, I'm sure.

Had an emotionally and mentally abusive mother. I say Had because she's gotten better. I can tolerate her existence now, sometimes even enjoy it. I thank her boyfriend. Great dude. I have large chunks of my childhood missing because of her, but from what my family has told me in my later years, I'm glad I don't remember. It's crippled me emotionally, but we'll get to that.

I was raped when I was 15, by my boyfriend at the time. I didn't want to have sex until I was older. He didn't want to wait. I spent my entire summer after freshman year in the basement, in AOL chat rooms playing D&amp;D. Thanks to that, I can type 100-140wps with perfect grammar, spelling and punctuation with a serious want to someday teach English in a high school. I doubt it'll happen, but God if I don't want it.

I started drinking that year, fell in love with the worst thing to ever happen to me, started skipping school, stopped caring. I had been cutting since I was 12; had depression and anxiety since I was a child. I got pregnant at 16 and was forced by my mother to have an abortion. Still have nightmares from that.

Managed to graduate high school. Moved down to the Twin Cities. Went to California twice, didn't want to leave, but I had to come home. Went to the east coast, went to Anime Boston, was so fucking drunk the whole time, loved every minute of it. Got pregnant at 21. Mother tried to convince me to abort it again. Told her to fuck off. Stopped drinking. Proud of myself for that.

I have a beautiful little five year old boy. He has my cheeks, and my nose, and my smile, and definitely my hair. Has his daddy's eyes, blue as blue can be. He loves Spiderman. His favorite color is red. He's super excited to start school like his stepbrother. He's extremely compassionate, but definitely weird like his mama.

My son's dad and I get along. His stepmother is a different matter. She's a special kind of stupid.

I was homeless for a time after my son was born. My son went to stay with his dad, because I couldn't let him be homeless with me. Got super fucking depressed, started drinking again. Not a fun time in my life.

Met my ex fiance. I was with him for two years. He had an anger problem, was extremely awkward. But the sex was good, not even going to lie. We stayed with his mother for a time to save up money for a house. She ended up kicking me out when I was trying to get started selling life insurance because I wasn't making enough money yet. Whatever lady, you're a cunt, I don't care.

Moved in with a friend up in St. Cloud. Was able to leave my ex. Ended up dating my friend. We just got a house in June. He has an eight year old son. He's extremely loving, but very jaded. So is his dad. They went through a lot of hell to get to where they are now, so I don't hold it against them. I'm working on breaking down their walls. I got my son back from his dad (a struggle, let me tell you).

There's plenty more I could go on with, but long story short I'm a PCA for my best friend and my SO and I have been together over a year. We have our ups and downs, but we're happy.

"dd5bwuh","&gt;Do you believe you have a purpose in life and how do you believe it came to be? 

Yes, I believe I have a purpose in life. This is because *I have defined* a purpose for my life. My purpose is to help my friends and family, and to learn about the world and the universe and to share knowledge and understanding and to be kind and compassionate. 

But this *does not come* from a supernatural being. It doesn't come from the universe. As far as the universe is concerned you have no purpose. Purpose comes from each person individually. 

&gt;How do you perceive abstract concepts such as love and faith? 

Love is observable and [definable](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/love). We can *see* affection between two people, we can *observe* the way they treat each other. Now, I concede that they may be lying and it may all be an act but such a view is overly cynical and it seems far more likely that when people seem to be in love that they are being honest.

Faith is again observable and [definable](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/faith), but just *because someone has faith in a being* does not mean that being is real or exists. What if someone believes in a magic flying horse. Is the flying horse real? Or spirit people? Or monsters? Do those supernatural things become real?

"dcvl3le","&gt; The police can turn anything negative when it comes to a rape case.

Police should take victims seriously without being credulous. Ideally the role of the victim advocate/ counselor is to be extremely solicitous, not the investigating officers'. They need to determine what happened in a compassionate but clear way so as to best inform the prosecutors in making a charging decision. When victim testimony alone is often the only evidence that can secure a conviction, the victim is, out of necessity, ""put on trial"" as well. This is a consequence of our adversarial legal system, and despite rape shield laws designed to limit the sort of evidence that can be admitted, victims will be challenged. Generally speaking, in cases lacking physical violence, eyewitnesses, or some other sort of external proof, their credibility will determine the outcome of the case. At trial, those 3 questions you've listed will almost always be relevant and admissible. 

1. Why were you alone with him?
-- critical question, cuts to the heart of the offense. Without asking this question, when relevant (i.e. not an exceptionally violent and/or stranger attack), no investigation can proceed. Was (s)he alone with him because she wanted to make out with him but not have sex? Was (s)he alone with him/her because they were lab partners working on an assignment together? Were they exes talking about reconciling? All of these factual circumstances matter a great deal in contextualizing the alleged attack and assessing victim credibility.

2. How much did you have to drink?
-- critical question, speaks directly to witness reliability/credibility. Unfortunately drunk witnesses make cases hard to prosecute, even if being drunk is never a ""reason"" why someone becomes the victim of a sex crime. Police need the full picture so that the prosecutors can prepare their case without any surprises from the defense. All it takes is a single reasonable doubt in the mind of jurors for an acquittal. All of the cards must be on the table. 

3. were you doing drugs?
-- same as above 

Police aren't turning these things into ""negatives,"" they're simply approaching a criminal investigation impartially. That's their job, and it always will be. 

Edit: made the post gender neutral. Sad to see people downvoting this without responding. All I've done is describe how our legal system works and why some of these difficult questions are often necessary parts of an investigation. I'll leave it to folks far smarter than I am to determine if there's a better way of handling criminal justice, but I can't think of one. Some [philosophers/social thinkers] (https://aeon.co/conversations/should-we-change-the-reasonable-doubt-standard-for-convictions-of-rape) have advocated for a lowered standard of proof for sex crimes.

INTP is probably no because they act more fiesty at times. A lot more self absorbed too and narcissistic on some levels. They are compassionate but sometimes defensive by nature imo. 

These types argue a lot too whereas INFJ have the same intellectual power but seem to be more agreeable. Strangely INTP often make logical fallacies to fuck with people too I think.

In the meantime I would document the student's behavior, reach out to the guardian, and if your school is a union shop, talk to a union rep to see what they suggest as far as protecting yourself from false allegations of inappropriate behavior on your part.

I would do exactly as you are doing, be kind and compassionate but also firm. Addressing problematic behavior in a positive and respectful way is an act of caring but a young special education student who has trouble with social cues cannot be expected to understand that without help and counseling.

"dc92e2t","I'm inclined to agree here, if even just a little bit, although I found the whole account less 'mocking' and more just a cathartic expungement of all the unholy things you probably had to deal with there. It must take a lot of compassion and some serious daily 'centering' of one's self in order to maintain the mental and emotion constitution that's required to support those kids. I could see how it could grind someone down. I work for a similar 'fat camp', but not for kids (ours is more for young professionals and executives), so I don't have to deal with the ground-level atrocities as much (plus I work in the marketing end of it). I'm curious though, at the camp you worked at, was there any emphasis placed on these kids having any kind of a ""break-through"" moment during their 6 weeks there? 6 weeks is a long time, and sometimes,... for really overweight people, I've found that it's good to take them right up to the emotional limit/breaking point (exhaustion point, whatever you want to call it), because after that moment (and it's usually a moment of crying, or just sitting in a corner, or even just wanting to quit and go home, etc.) things get a lot better.

"dc3wuvq","I hope you see this, although I'm sure it will get lost in the shuffle. I have been where you are. I know the guilt and the confusion you feel. I was torn. I didn't know whether to be supportive or to walk away. My family was never supportive towards me and he was all I felt I had, even though his addiction (variety of drugs, but mostly pain killers and alcohol) made him abusive. But he didn't mean it, it was the addiction speaking! I was constantly trying to convince myself what he was doing would get better. Months of, ""after this, I'll stop. Once this happens, I won't need the pills."" It doesn't end unless he chooses to stop.

NOTHING gets better unless HE wants it to. My ex's mom was an enabler, too. She would go to the dr and get pain pills to give to him. She would give him cash to go buy pills on the street. I was left in the middle, fearful of the repercussions I could potentially face if he were caught. He went to a rehab facility, and was better for a little while. I went to support groups for family of addicts. I studied and researched becoming an addiction counselor. I did literally anything and everything I could do to understand WHY this happened to him and, more importantly, to me. I was 20. I was young and hopeful, and dealing with this completely changed me. It took him 8 years to change. He is finally clean - no pills, no alcohol, no smoking pot, no drugs whatsoever. Although I made the decision to move on and move 2 hours away, he still contacts me thanking me for staying by his side for most of his recovery, and that he understands why I had to leave.

I am sharing my story on addiction to hopefully inspire you to seek help for you. I can tell you are very caring and compassionate, but you do not deserve to be hurt by something you have no control over. I support your decision to stay if he is committed to becoming clean, but also know that he will be fighting those demons for a long time.

I'm not necessarily saying you need to be compassionate, but just empathetic. *If* there are racial imbalances which result in certain minorities being imprisoned, shot, or persecuted primarily on the basis of race (so profiling on the basis of race, meaning a degree of bigotry rather than evidence of personal fault), then people will act in kind. We fought a civil war on the issue of slavery and here we have localized cases of cop killing/brutality due to the racial imbalance of persecution of minorities (at least under the narrative). This still falls in line with the framework of the argument and doesn't disprove that there is no room for civility in the instance of forms/degrees of oppression. Consider this, if there do exist racial imbalances when it comes to detainment and prosecution, then why should there be civility? What should the people, categorized as oppressed, do?

*Rose Sloane*. An 18 year-old magician who worked as a teaching assistant. She leaves with her new friend, Isaak, to go off searching for buried magic schools. She's *incredibly* clever, sardonic and compassionate, but has a tendency to be stand-offish and blunt to a fault. Unlike her name, Rose is a brunette and doesn't have a ""prickly"" exterior.

Despite her arrogance, Lyre does care about others and has a great deal of respect for those in educational fields. Lyre's cockiness stems from her being surrounded by constant praise as a child, for her great magic abilities.

"daqiabk","While I can say how I feel, I would point out that my opinion will be my own, and not representative of any majority (or minority even) of the Taiwanese population. My education is highly westernized, and I spent more than half of my life out of the country, so I'm hardly representative. Might want to poke /u/watbe and /u/kuso1234 as well and see what their POV is.

Oh, I also lived in China for a while, during which I was unapologetically Taiwanese. It was not an entirely nice experience, so some grudges are personal. Watching China get upset is sort of fun, after the initial facepalm. I mean, he could have not picked up, China. And we don't care being called insidious, so go slap US in the face about it.

I'm ambivalent whether the US pres-elect's character is as simple as you described. He has demonstrated during his campaign to be offensive and fail to see the problems in doing so. At the same time, I've heard second hand accounts of people vouching for his business abilities. As for being easy to manipulate...if I thought that, I think I'll be underestimating him. So I'm going to assume that everything I just said is true: the upcoming POTUS is a person whose natural deposition makes him a businessmen, who say outrageous things without thought or reflection, who, although he may be manipulated, probably can weed out who actually knows their stuff and who doesn't. In other words, not book smart, not considerate, certainly not compassionate, but shrewd and selfish in a way that really benefits him.

Generally, I'm peeved that the US involves itself in the China-Taiwan affair, though it's begrudgingly accepted that without SOME outside menace, China would have stormed Taiwan long ago. Now that this guy's involved... I do feel sympathy for those in the US who are endangered by him holding office, but it's honestly an opportunity for Taiwan to take advantage of. In fact, none of the other presidential candidates would have led to today's scenario, because it would be near political suicide. Now it's just ""idiotic president elect does idiotic thing/allowed idiotic thing to happen."" So for once, the US might not dominate the conversation and we can actually say our piece for once. If there are any actual interference, it won't be from him, it'll be his advisers. If we're careful and our goals align with his advisers', things might turn out at least okayish.

The bribery part is a concern. People in the /r/Taiwan sub did point out several potential problems. Promises may be empty, and we might just be a bargaining chip for him. He can screw us over like he did the small businesses that worked on his casino. Though given that we're talking about countries-- sovereign states and not businesses, I'm not sure his advisers would allow that to happen, unless they don't mind the US's reputation plummeting into hell. And staying there, because I doubt Taiwan will ever forgive the US if that happens. We most certainly won't forgive HIM if it happens.

TL;DR: I loathe the situation because it's generally annoying that the US is involved, even more so now that this guy is involved.

"daoqizu","""Truth... is problematic. You have a dangerous way of thinking. You have positioned yourself, probably thanks to the isolation of your condition, into an intellectual corner where nothing that doesn't come from your own head can ever seem right to you. ""

this is false, i learn new things every day. Having a ton load of science knowledge doesn't make me somehow magically wrong just for the heck of it like most people seem to need to excuse away.

i'm not wrong for being right. Geez.



""Look how you have spoken to me throughout this conversation... you have been condescending and insulting a number of times, but in your head you are being compassionate. But thats not compassion.""

right, so i'm just taking all this time because i don't care....lol.

You are inside a subjective bubble. Whatever it may seem like to you, i'm showing compassion in spades.

I get it what it looks like inside of the bubble. er. thats holding you inside. captive.



""You think you are trying to save me from my ignorance.... but how many times in your life has somebody perhaps tried to save you from your isolation?""

not enough.

Its a vicious circle. ignorance is bliss, and i got 20 phds of weight and pain to carry.

alienating to you? alienating to me. you only get to live with it for the short time you interact with me. I get to live inside of it 24-7.



 ""how many times has someone tried to show you that ""this is not how you speak to people"" or ""this is not a healthy way of thinking"".""

oh, i dunno, maybe once a year.



""You have made some enormous leaps about me based on what, a couple casual comments on reddit? You don't know who I am or what my motives are or what my experience is or what I've gone through or learned. ""



i can only model you as effectively as the model of you you present via your interaction with me. Turns out i'm better at that than most people by a clear margin- as tested in the lab.



""And yet you feel completely comfortable talking to me as if you have been my psychologist for 40 years.""

subjectively speaking on my side, thats about what its like. As nice as i am trying to be to the humans, the difference is sufficient and powerful enough on my side to make you guys transparent to me to look in at all the goopity grey matter details. It started out as a kid as an aspie mind blind. now i'm like a psi MRI scan- I know the psychology and the formal conversational logic- i build incredibly real models of other peoples mental states compared to almost anyone else.

I also listen and respond to every detail. I'm not just blowing past it all like you guys do. 




"" Thats a scary level of self delusion and self righteousness. ""

only if its not true. 

Its only a delusion if its wrong and its only self righteous if its wrong. if i actually do have 20 phds of advanced science knowledge, then i have every right to see myself in that light, and since my everyday interactions with people do not prove to me that something is wrong with me but rather that something is wrong with them, i'm going to take the advice of the guy in the white lab coat who once took me aside between tests to let me know that people are always going to react strangely to unusual people- and that says everything about them and very little if anything at all about me.

He had just got done doing the projection tests. you watch a scene, a very short scene, and then they ask you to fill in the blanks forward and backwards for the rest of the story. Low IQ folks can't even play the game. High IQ folks can play the game but typically fill in details which betray things about themselves very clearly- measurable assumptions which can be clocked as projections. I was able to simultaneously fill in the blanks and maintain a choice tree- something i did without prompting- which defeated the test- ""if outcome A happens, or assumption a is true, then story x concludes- but if different assumptions...""

And list possibilities even outside of the the scope of their test brainstorm materials.

ETC. According to lab men in white coats, i have a 180 IQ and i'm HYPER SANE.

So whatever.



""and the word part is, because you've positioned yourself how you have, absolutely nothing I just said will permeate. ""

the opposite is true, i can reality test you as very uncommonly intelligent and compassionate. IE, your wrong about me, but your engaged with me for the two reasons your very smart and your trying to be compassionate with me over what you view as my communication style failure.

Thats admirable.




""You will just write it off as me resisting your immense knowledge, or me projecting or whatever.""

Hmmm, No, i am sure there is all sorts of room in theory for improvement on my side, i'm not writing it off, i'm just not playing along with the game. I'm not the one with the problems here. I'm solid gold. You guys want out of the matrix, here i am.

Maybe you don't want out yet. maybe you are cozy in the warm rising waters flooding your reality with social entropy. Well when it gets nose high maybe you will change your mind and come back for help.

"dajnu3r","&gt;&gt;What are the implications of such a starkly bifurcated coalition? One consequence is the ongoing disfigurement of the liberal political imagination. **In a world where Ivy League students — the sons and daughters of Fairfax and Marin — vote for Clinton at a clip of more than 80 percent, elite Democrats find it exceedingly difficult to identify any tangible common interests they share with most American workers.**

&gt;Instead, **their attitude toward working-class Americans tends to take two forms. On the one hand, a growing contempt for the (white) workers who have slowly drifted away from the Democratic Party; on the other, an essentially philanthropic if not paternalistic concern for “the most vulnerable” (nonwhite) workers who ostensibly remain within the Democratic camp.**

&gt;This has given us an elite liberal discourse that grows eloquent about questions of “privilege” and “empathy,” **but cannot seem to imagine a politics of power and solidarity.** It has given us a liberalism that adores means-testing and looks askance at universal goods — not because universal goods are too expensive, but because they might benefit someone who isn’t deservingly deprived.

&gt;The Clinton campaign carried this brand of liberalism faithfully forward. It represented the apotheosis of a Democratic Party leadership that primarily envisions the working class as a downtrodden group in need of help, rather than a sleeping giant in need of organization. A leadership that views politics as a room where clever experts hash out benevolent policies for the neediest, rather than a field of mass struggle in which everybody’s basic welfare is at stake. A leadership that may be genuinely tolerant, inclusive, and compassionate, **but whose own class blinders make it almost impossible for them to think about progressive politics in terms of collective self-interest.**

&gt;These Democratic leaders, to be sure, may be able to reclaim the presidency without attracting more working-class support. In the aftermath of Clinton’s defeat, some analysts are already urging Democrats to abandon the Rust Belt once and for all, while focusing on college-educated voters in the Sunbelt.

&gt;But **even if this version of the Democratic Party somehow retook Congress and the White House, how would it govern?** Why should we believe that a party ever more dominated by affluent professionals — no matter how virtuous their intentions — will ever be able to address the material concerns of voters like Cedric Fleming?

&gt;The **true political strength of the Left is not that it has a monopoly of virtue, but that it has a monopoly of numbers.** Justice for the most vulnerable is not possible, and will never be possible, unless we recognize that our fight is about justice for all.

&gt;This does not mean submerging every group identity, and every distinct lived experience, into an undifferentiated mass. **But it does mean working to build a coalition that is yoked together not by empathy or patronage but by common goals and common enemies.**

&gt;Simply put, the lesson of the 2016 election is not that that the Democrats should “appeal” to the “white working class.” **It is that left-wing politics will never get anywhere if we cannot harness the passionate self-interest of the entire working class.**",1480373005,"a leadership that may be genuinely tolerant, inclusive, and compassionate, **but whose own class blinders make it almost impossible for them to think about progressive politics in terms of collective self-interest.**  &gt;these democratic leaders, to be sure, may be able to reclaim the presidency without attracting more working-class support.","inclusive, and compassionate","compassionate",NA,TRUE,"inclusive , and compassionate","inclusive",NA,NA,0
"dahe39t","Saying comments like, ""Omg no way, you're so skinny!"" or ""your body is fine--look at your skinny arms!"" etc is not the way to help. 

It's inappropriate for her to be commenting on your body. It's weird and not good manners. So you need to set good boundaries with her in a firm but loving and compassionate way, and for the love of god stop positively reinforcing the behavior by commenting about her body. 

""Hun, you make ME feel bad about MYself when you comment about my body every single time I get dressed. I'm here to talk if you need me, but please don't bring my body into it. I can't help the way I am and I'm not trying to hurt you."" 

You have every right to get dressed in peace without being punished and bombarded by her illness. Coddling her and giving compliments is not healthy and it's not helping. You can be loving, supportive, and compassionate but still have boundaries. It's not wrong to expect basic respect and courtesy, and although she doesn't realize it what she is doing IS disrespectful to you. 

I had friends who would constantly comment on my body when I was younger. I HATED it. Like, can I please just stand here without my body becoming public property for everyone to comment on and compare? I'm not a piece of meat and please leave me out of your eating disorder. 

By bringing your body into it all the time, she is making you feel bad and self-conscious. You deserve and have every right to be in control of your body and to not be subject to a visual critique every time you change outfits. 

So, you need to be firm but loving. ""Hon, I'm really worried about you. I want you to know that I think you are so amazing, smart, and beautiful. I understand you are really struggling right now and I will be here for you as a friend. But in order for you to overcome this, and for me to be able to help you as a friend, you NEED to top commenting on my body. I know you don't intend to, but it really makes me feel bad about myself and it makes me feel really violated. I am here to help you through the issues that you have, but I can't have you constantly commenting on my body. It makes me uncomfortable.""

"daefp49","Since I'm Canadian and you're referencing the US, let's compare Canada and the US on this topic. As a Canadian, statistically speaking, we travel more than Americans (about 70% of Canadians have passports, vs just 46% of Americans from [this source](http://www.theexpeditioner.com/2010/02/17/how-many-americans-have-a-passport-2/)). I think a big part of this has to do with how Americans are brought up to think of their country. They are taught that America is the best country in the world, the safest country, the land of opportunity, etc. And it is a great place, don't get me wrong - but when you're fed that message for most of your life, you begin to internalize it. Why leave when you have everything you need in the good 'ol US of A? Add on fears of terrorsim and Islamaphobia, and you've got a recipe for disaster when it comes to leaving the country.

In Canada a big part of what identifies us as Canadians is that we take pride in our multiculturalism (though not everyone here actually does, I'll admit), or our ""cultural mosaic"" as we call it. In turn, America refers to their multiculturalism as a ""melting pot"" which sort of insinuates that they expect outsiders to conform and become a part of the mix, whereas in Canada we respect cultural differences and want them to stand out. We are both countries that accept immigrants from around the world, yet our way of thinking or the lens through which we internalize this is quite different.

Again, I know that not everyone in Canada views it this way (we're not perfect) and that not *everyone* in the US is insular, but I think that's at least how I can sort of relate to what you posted above, and maybe why that's an issue that's quite exemplified in American culture even though people like that exist everywhere.

Waiting periods and background checks are fine, but politicians really seem to make dumb laws that impinge on people who should be able to own guns if they want to as opposed to criminals who will get the guns despite any laws that are in place. On the other side, I think large corporations have far to much influence over politicians and our government in general, and should be paying at least as much in taxes as ""regular folks"" earning $30k to $300k. The ultra rich have so much money in banks outside of America just to avoid taxes, it's obscene and really unpatriotic.

"d9nhue9","My situation is in many ways similar to yours (ancestors on both sides from Nauvoo, served a mission but didn't ""feel"" it, current BYU student), so I'll just share a couple of thoughts that have worked for me.

- Don't rush this. If you haven't thought this already, you might soon come to a point where you think ""I have to make a decision *right now* - am I going to commit myself 100% to the church, or am I going to resign?"" Thoughts like that are a little silly. You have the rest of your life ahead of you, so take your time with these decisions.
- Continue to learn, continue to research. The more you know, the more comfortable you'll become and the more things will start to make sense.
- Figure out what you believe and what you don't believe. Say and do what you believe, and (for now) don't say what you don't believe. If you have to ""bear your testimony"" but you know that Joseph was a fraud, don't bear your testimony about Joseph Smith! Bear your testimony about something that you believe; if your Mom/Dad want to talk about a gospel topic, listen and pitch in when you can share something that you actually believe, etc.
- Don't worry about the depression, anxiety, and even anger that may occasionally surface. These feelings are normal. Reach out to people you trust (or to the compassionate but anonymous people on this board) and share how you're feeling. We're happy to commiserate and empathize with you, and help you in any way possible.
- Make the best academic decision that is possible. I chose to stay at BYU because I could graduate earlier if I stayed. Otherwise, I would have transferred. Depending on where you are in your educational career, it might be a good idea to look for a school that wouldn't punish you if you chose to stop attending church or resign.
- Recognize the good that is in the church. Sure, there's a lot of bad; but there's also a great emphasis on the nuclear family, individual responsibility, and service. The church has helped you learn how to network, make friends, speak in public, and organize/coordinate events. Realize that your time in the church was not totally wasted, and look for things that you can carry with you as you move forward in life.

I wish you the best - I'm in a virtually identical situation, and I know how hard it is.

That snake though. Oh man. Who else still gets chills all over when you read the description of that slithering snake and the way he says his name? *Asmodeusssssssssss* Gah it makes me so squeamy.

Cluny the scourge is my idea of a perfect villain. He's cruel, intimidating, and ruthless. He's also cunning and clever, and his descriptions. Man! The chant-like phrase of ""Cluny the Scourge is coming to Redwall"" always fills me with dreadful anticipation.

Perhaps what you see is the way that it is, not because of anything inherent in our brains, but because the trait of 'compassion' was a necessity for women to have if they wanted to eat, and therefore it was given natural precedence over women's pursuit of knowledge or skill. It's not to say that they didn't still have the capacity for it. And it's not to say that women who were cooped up in the house didn't experience depression from their options being so limited. Many, many intelligent, female authors who didn't choose to use a pseudonym to be taken seriously wrote about this very passionately. Virginia Woolf, Sylvia Plath, Betty Friedan - the mental anguish a human being is subject to when they're told they're less than and relegated to a cage.

Women couldn't pursue knowledge in order to secure resources, so said their male counterparts. They historically HAD to pursue family and children. No option. That division of labor exists no more, and because of it I was able to go to college and find a purpose for myself outside of kids. There is now an option for me, and yet here you are still trying to argue against my personal freedom.

You can't tell a little girl that it's in her genetics to make babies and do nothing else with her life. You can't tell women that the strength of a community can only be obtained through her giving up her desire to achieve anything. You can't do that. You're arguing against my freedom and restricting me to a life that I don't want. I am a human being. If we can't figure out a way to secure peace within a community without employing methods of slavery, then what the hell.

I've kind of been through something similliar. A few years ago, it was discovered that my grandma had brain cancer---a kind that was very likely incurable and not even really treatable. Even if it were curable, the tumor was so large that she would have had permanent brain damage even if it were removed....if she came out of surgery. 

My grandpa had to weigh surgery vs. biopsy vs. pallative care because even if my grandma understood this, she could not communicate her wishes. To put it mildly, this was not an easy time for anyone. 

What made him finally decide was a very compassionate neurosurgeon who sat down with him, and explained in plain english, what each choice would mean, and what we could likely expect. What it ended up coming down to was that *maybe* we could buy her a few more months...but it would rob everyone of *her*. That was our second neurosurgeon. We fired the first for having an atrocious bedside manner and pushing surgery.

"d7wctua","Darkness and light are the two primary elements of my world. There are others, but they're all kind of lumped together under ""the primal elements,"" where folks argue weather it's ""air"" or ""metal and wood,"" or should ""void"" and ""cold"" and ""soul"" be considered elements or not... all that fun stuff.

Shadow and light don't have that kind of uncertainty tied to them. Their existence is not controversial, but instead fundamental to the existence of life. 

Light is associated with the realm of Faerie, the fey, and the Fountain of Youth, from whence all life flows. Meanwhile, Darkness is associated with the realm of Shadow, the horrors, and the great Pit at the end of creation. 

Now, many folks tend to also associate light with good, and darkness with evil, and thus Faerie and the fey with good and Shadow and its horrors with evil, but that couldn't be further from the truth. Fey can be kind and compassionate, but they can also be capricious, fickle beings who are just as likely to view humans as mere playthings as they are to deem us equals. Meanwhile, more than a few horrors use their fear as a weapon against the evils of the world, striking terror into the hearts of villains.

For just like darkness, fear doesn't have to be evil. The dark can protect you, hide you from harm. It can disguise blemishes, and make the bright points shine even brighter. It brings calm and rest to the world of men. Likewise, fear can be what keeps you alive. It provides you with the knowledge that things are wrong, and the drive to fix them, or to survive. Fear can be used as a weapon of chaos and disorder, but it has also been used as a tool for law and order over the ages. And fear can be fun, or else why would we keep telling ghost stories, watching horror films, and visiting haunted houses?

Likewise, people associate the darkness and Shadow with destruction, thanks to the Pit. But as terrifying as oblivion is, it is necessary for creation to exist. The dark, empty void takes the old and worn in reality, and makes way for the new: new ideas, new worlds, new life. It may not be friendly or welcoming, but without destruction, the world would become a cluttered, static mess where nothing ever changes.

Now, shadow and light aren't strictly the domains of fey and horrors. There are mages who focus on channelling the magic of Faerie and Shadow, there are spirits of light and dark, there are vampires who use blood magic to twist shadows and jinn who shape raw illumination into brilliant palaces. There are angels who cloak themselves in shadow, and demons who shine forth in terrible, unholy light. There are even fey who court the darkness, and horrors who bend the light. Light and dark--just like life and death, order and chaos, creation and destruction--does not choose sides. Noble heroes can wield the subtle powers of the night just as well as wicked villains can enslave the might of day. Now, due to its associations with life and goodness, more noble souls are drawn to the powers of light, but it's not absolute. Darkness has just had a bad rap over the millennia, one that both the fey and horrors are willing to play off of to their own ends. 

There's a few other associations I made in my world, like light is associated with nature and chaos while shadows are associated with civilisation and law, but those get a bit more metaphorical and abstract (and are more due to ""fey are chaotic and like natural places, while horrors are bureaucratic and feed off of mankind, so civilisation provides them with more food."") I've done a lot with this idea in my world, and subverting the whole ""light is good and dark is evil"" trope happens to be one of my favourite--and likely most overused--themes when I'm writing.",1474482522,"fey can be kind and compassionate, but they can also be capricious, fickle beings who are just as likely to view humans as mere playthings as they are to deem us equals.","kind and compassionate","compassionate",NA,FALSE,"kind and compassionate","kind",NA,NA,0

"d7oqn64","I think that these conditions that are broadly lumped into ""psychosomatic"" complaints present a unique type of challenge for physicians, especially primary care physicians.

You have to balance the possibility that there's a treatable condition that is being missed with the very real harms that come from over testing and over treating.

Not that I claim to be any kind of expert, but for these conditions, like IBS, fibromyalgia, some of the chronic pain syndromes, or chronic fatigue, you have to think about depression and anxiety and you have to make a compassionate but emphatic case to your patients that if they have comorbid anxiety and depression it doesn't make their suffering any less real and it does deserve therapy.

More generally, I don't think it's possible to develop a therapeutic relationship with these patients without acceptance that their suffering, distress and pain are real. From that starting point, you have to distance yourself and think objectively about the harms and benefits of potential workup and therapy, and then you have to honestly explain your reasoning to your patients.

It's not going to work for every patient, but if you start from a place of disbelief and skepticism, regardless of how scientifically sound it might be, even the best actor can't hide that from your patient forever, and it will prevent any success at alleviating their suffering.

"d7hbcqo","I kind of agree....I think it's unclear if Four did what he did just because of his memories, or whether he would have just did the same thing anyways without them.

Basically once he solidified his political power, he had the option to deal with things more nobly or ruthlessly.....he choose the latter. Ruthless was the smarter choice as it totally eliminates the possibility of his enemies regaining political power, and it seriously weakens the threat of the seers (they are after Nyx too who he has a thing for, and he doesn't need the seers). Four has been ruthless without his memories before, I think it'll be more telling how he'll deal with the Raza Crew. They don't want to give him a fleet of blink drive ships, he needs that to secure his homeworld's victory/survival.

There's a lot of subtle stuff to consider about Four. His father was trying to teach him to be ruthless over being noble and compassionate. Without his memories and dealing with non-personal backstory stuff, he seemed to tend to be more noble than ruthless. It could be argued whenever he did this, he made mistakes. I find it interesting that without his memories and not pursuing his past, it seems he may have ended up more noble and compassionate that his younger self wanted to be; but with his memories and past he's doing what his father wanted him to be, ruthless and merciless.

There seems to be some parallels with the Android, and Two here. As the Android becomes more ""human"" she ""makes mistakes"", as Four regains his memories and becomes more cold and ruthless, he ""makes less mistakes"". Two with her memories is more ruthless and less compassionate (as Four said), just like how Four seems to be acting now. It almost seems like Four is admiring what the Android and Two has become because he wishes he could be more noble and compassionate, but he knows he has to be ruthless and merciless to ""make less mistakes"" and save his homeworld.

"d6w3inc","That's a great question, and one that I sometimes ask myself regarding certain patients. For some patients, especially those with borderline or histrionic personality disorders, they don't know how to get attention/help without resorting to extreme statements such as that. I had one that carved the words ""fat bitch"" into their arm with their fake nails and told me they never wanted to do it, but refused to trim or remove their nails to prevent future incidents. It took a long time working with them to get them to understand that someone would be there to listen and work through their feelings even if they just asked to talk instead of resorting to drastic measures. 
For a lot of patients, suicide is an easy option (note: easy in this case does not mean it's the ""cowards way out"" or anything. Rather, so many individuals with lifelong mental illness are exhausted of constantly trying, and just want to finally get some peace). In the case of the patient I mentioned above, they are a teenager who is smart, funny, and compassionate, but hasn't learned to navigate emotional highs and lows. When they are in a low spot, death seems like the only option. It's my job to try to get them evened out and see the potential in themselves. But there are moments when I hear about a former patient who committed suicide after leaving my hospital. I've never met a patient who I thought would be better off dead, but in those moments I am glad that they are no longer suffering. 
Finally, from a legal perspective, any mental health worker or facility will keep a suicidal person in their care regardless of how much they want to die to cover their asses. Don't get me wrong, our primary motivation is to help individuals make a life worth going back to, but if someone who was once in our care kills themselves, we need to be able to show that we did everything within our power possible to keep them alive. A few years ago, an individual in the jail I also work at killed themselves. While they were alive, their family would have nothing to do with us and never answered our calls regarding medication, if they wanted to visit, how we could help this detainee more effectively, etc. However, once the individual had killed themselves, everyone was hit with a lawsuit. That may not be the best example, but the point is, even if the individual in question genuinely wants to die, as soon as they are gone, people who haven't been involved in their lives for years will see dollar signs. It sucks, because if they had been that involved in the person's life when they were alive, the person might not have felt so isolated or alone.

"d6u6w7y","&gt; So you think the personalities and manner of rule plays no role in how their viewed by their subjects? You think the fact that Ned clearly was a compassionate but lawful man had zero impact on how he was viewed? Again, I'm not saying nobody feared the Starks, but my point is that their honor helped them in addition to hurting them.

Yes, pretty much. Considering their own vassals were the main cause of their downfall I'd argue it did not help them at all. Other realms with 'less compassionate' rulers or even previous Stark rulers with little to no compassion did not suffer the same betrayal from their vassals that Robb Stark did. It did not help them. 

Though I'm not really sure you can call Robb either compassionate or particularly honorable. 

Ned was definitely honorable but I don't really see much evidence that his vassals either saw him as compassionate or even particularly highly valued that in a leader. 

&gt; What evidence from the books? You've posted a couple of quotes and one of them doesn't even definitely mean what you're saying it means.

Robb and his army were murdered by the Boltons and Karstarks at the Red Wedding. 

Which other Overlord saw that kind of betrayal from his vassals in the series? 

&gt; What kind of evidence would you accept?

Actual evidence. You have not used any quotes to back up your opinion, you have not given any examples of Northern vassal acting one way and vassal of such and such a realm acting in a much worse manner. 

You have given your opinion with nothing to back it up. Absolutely nothing. 

And while I find the Northern vassals to be similar to their peers there is actually more evidence in the series that they are more backstabbing and disloyal to their Starks than many of their peers. However I am happy to give them the benefit of the doubt. 

So while I am happy to ignore the evidence showing the Starks to have even less loyal vassals than their peers I am obviously going to need some sort of evidence when you claim they are more loyal. 

&gt; You said the westerland vassals were more loyal the the stark vassals.

Which they undoubtedly were in the series. If you can provide evidence contradicting this then I am happy to hear it. 

&gt; I've already provided anecdotes of the Umbers being especially loyal to the Starks. 

No you have not. 

* The Greatjon had to be threatened with his life to join Robb in trying to free his father. That is not being especially loyal. 

* When Bran an Rickon were captured at Winterfell Rodrik sent ravens demanding help and the Umbers (like many others) did not send help. The much further away Karstarks and Flints sent men, the Umbers did not. They gave men to Ramsay but not to help Ned's sons at Winterfell.

The Umbers are not 'especially' loyal. They are as loyal as the average vassal. The Greatjon is simply loud. 


&gt; What I asked for was evidence that the westerland vassals are more loyal than the northern vassals were to the Starks

The Boltons and Karstarks betrayed Robb, did they not? They had him and his loyalists murdered. 

The Dustins and Ryswells sent as few men as possible, did they not?

You are arguing, contrary to evidence from the books, that the Starks and their vassals have a special relationship that the other Lords do not have. You are making the claim and are offering zero evidence to back it up. 

&gt; (particularly Ned and Robb because they are the ""too honorable"" ones).

Ned was honorable. Robb was not. He betrayed the Freys, how is Robb any more honorable than the average Westerosi Lord?

Name any character who talks about Robb being particularly honorable?

&gt; You're putting a whole lot of emphasis on one abberation, which doesn't say much about your theory.

lol I'm not the one with the theory, you are. You are claiming that the Starks and their vassals have a 'special' releationship. That is the theory. Claiming that they have a normal relationship with their vassals is not a theory. 

&gt; We know the potential downside to the Stark honor, my point is it comes with upsides as well. 

Really? Name them. Name what upsides it has had? Name how these upsides offset Robb being the first Stark in thousands of years to lose control of the North. Please, I'd love to hear them. 

&gt; So when talking about the potential upside, it doesn't really make sense to rely so heavily on the already admitted downside.

eh? Again, I'm all ears. What is this 'potential' upside that will make up for the Starks capital and smallfolk being slaughtered by Northern vassals? What is the this potential upside for Robb and his men being murdered by Roose and other Northern soldiers?

&gt; Oh please. It's obvious that the only reason the northern houses stuck with Robb is because he was also a good leader

He seemed a good leader and they crowned him. He then lost the North and showed himself to be a pretty poor leader and they killed him. 

&gt;  If Robin Arryn were the same as Robb you'd have a point. 

Tell men again, which one is still alive and which one was murdered by their own vassal?

"d6u5okg","&gt;And how do you know it is any different in any other realm? That Lord Farman did not admire the way Tywin threatened him and follows him out of respect?
&gt;I am saying that the Overlords and their vassals releationship is pretty similar in every realm. If you don't think it is and the Starks have some unique relationship that the other Lords do not have should you not be trying to use example from the text to prove your point?

So you think the personalities and manner of rule plays no role in how their viewed by their subjects? You think the fact that Ned clearly was a compassionate but lawful man had **zero** impact on how he was viewed? Again, I'm not saying nobody feared the Starks, but my point is that their honor helped them in addition to hurting them.

&gt;So far in the series we have seen more Northern vassals turn traitor than any other realm. We have seen more Northern vassals express a fear of the Starks than anyone else.

Can you prove this? Because even if there is any objective truth to this, it's probably skewed because we simply see more about the northern houses than any other realm.

&gt;I'm actually giving the Starks the benefit of the doubt here as ultimately I think, despite the obvious evidence from the books, that they their vassals have a similar sense of loyalty to them then the vassals of the Vale, Westerlands, Dorne etc.

What evidence from the books? You've posted a couple of quotes and one of them doesn't even definitely mean what you're saying it means.

&gt;And I don't think there is any evidence that the Stark vassals are any different to the vassals of the other lands.

What kind of evidence would you accept?

&gt;The Red Wedding when the Boltons and Karstarks killed Robb Stark. The Dustins and Ryswells who sent the bare minimum of men with Robb and ignored the calls from Winterfell (like the Umbers did) when they requested help.

You said the westerland vassals were more loyal the the stark vassals. Maybe you're not too familiar with objective analysis, but anecdotes don't make a point. I've already provided anecdotes of the Umbers being especially loyal to the Starks. There are moments of loyalty, there are moments of disloyalty. What I asked for was evidence that the westerland vassals are more loyal than the northern vassals were to the Starks (particularly Ned and Robb because they are the ""too honorable"" ones).

&gt;If any Westerland bannermen had done what the Boltons and Karstarks did we would have heard about it.
.
&gt;Except Roose and the four thousand men with him. That is over a fifth of Robb's army who betrayed him.

You're putting a whole lot of emphasis on one abberation, which doesn't say much about your theory. Especially if you'll recall the context of the discussion, the point has already been made about the red wedding. We *know* the potential downside to the Stark honor, my point is it comes with upsides as well. So when talking about the potential upside, it doesn't really make sense to rely so heavily on the already admitted downside.

&gt;eh? So Ned (in his mid 30's) dies and the respect his vassals had for him follows on to his son yet Jon Arryn (dies in his 80's) dies and so does the respect his vassals had for him?
&gt;Come on!

Oh please. It's obvious that the only reason the northern houses stuck with Robb is because he was also a good leader, being taught by Ned. If Robin Arryn were the same as Robb you'd have a point. But again, a lot of your arguments rely very heavily on the fact that we simply don't see much of these other realms first hand.


EDIT: It's also obviously very hard to ""prove"" something so sentimental, as you just get a sense for how these people are viewed while reading through the entire series, but searching around this does not at all seem to be a novel concept:

http://asoiaf.westeros.org/index.php?/topic/91055-the-lannisters-approach-to-their-vassals-vs-the-starks-approach-to-theirs/

&gt;On one end of the paradigm we have the Starks, who are upright, honest and just to the point of weakness, and are beloved by their vassals for all of those traits. On the other end we have the Lannisters who, at least under Tywin and his children, embrace an almost Machiavellian approach to rule and are feared by their vassals. 

.

&gt;If I was sworn to house lannister and seen what happened to at castermere I would fear the lannister and would not rebel unless I was 99% sure of victory

.

&gt;The Manderlys, Umbers, Mountain clans etc. all seem to love the Starks first and the Stark members second.

.

&gt;I never said that the Starks' bannerman loved them. I do think that they are tied to the Starks for reasons other than fear i.e. mutual respect, understanding, and history.

Obviously there are people who disagree, but the notion that the Starks are *generally* more well loved or admired by their subjects and vassals than the Lannisters seems not at all outlandish.

"d6q682n","I have a main group of eight (probably a lot, but that number used to be higher) that rotate between protagonist, deuteragonist, tritatgonist etc. Some have less information because it would spoil too much of later book ideas.

**Galen Ravencroft**: A young scholar of the Kingdom of Aurelius and a childhood friend of the royal family children. He is a Scholar of the Lorekeepers Association and the Black Codex, wielder and holder of the Black Archive, a collection of Oblivion Magic, while he himself is proficient in archive, runes, and shadow magic. He was forced into the role by his mother's need to prepare him, and happily gives up the job for a time, and to the relief of the Association. Galen is generally calm and reserved, though hides a much colder and ruthless personality. He is the most common POV, but he is not the hero.

**Luciana ""Lucy"" Aurelius**: The princess of the Holy Aurelian Kingdom, best friend to Galen and younger sister of Alistair. Lucy is an energetic tomboy princess, very kind and compassionate but extremely stubborn and oblivious. Lucy possesses divine magic as a cleric canter, and invokes her power in songs, including arias, marching, and pop songs. 

**Alistair Aurelius**: The second prince of Aurelius and second son of King Erik, older brother to Lucy. Alistair is nominally a paladin, and does have light-based powers, though he is mellow, lazy, and roguish, having turned into a delinquent (dresses a bit like Dante), wielding guns and hanging out with thieves. He is the hero, and learns that he needs to stop messing around.

**Karin Marke**: Daughter of House Marke of Ostia, Karin is a sorceress in training that uses ice, lighting, and fire, along with gemstone magic. (I based her on Rin Tohsaka mostly, with a few other characters). Karin is the twin sister of Connor and arranged to marry Alistair, if she could stand him. Karin attempts to be an elegant sorceress and noblewoman, an academic athlete beloved by the school, while hiding her tomboyish/ladette past and continued love of wine, mechanics, hunting etc. Karin is an elegant lady of black magic, but this falls apart when she is forced into melee, instead using the mace attached to her staff and becoming a bruiser. 

**Xavier Tomas ""Zane"" Valois**: The prince of the nation of Tenoire, a cold and stoic individual and dark knight to contrast Alistair, considering Alistair to be his rival. Unlike Alistair who rebels from his duties, Zane rebels because he is disgusted with his country's decadent court, and tries to be more than that. He wields the dark blade, Gloom Steel, a sword that generates shards of demonic iron.

**Dawn Marke**: The cousin (sort of half-sister since their fathers are twins) of Karin and Conner. Dawn is the daughter of General James Marke and Deidra Everwood, also known as the Ghost Queen/Darkened Druid Queen, ruler of the Court of Ghosts. Kept with her brother Theron on her father's plantation by who she thought to be a normal mother, she was introduced to the Court of Ghosts, but did not like the darkness around her. Rejecting necromancy, Dawn chose to be a medic as a botanical alchemist. Although her mother was benevolent for a necromancer queen, another necromancer, Barrows (a combo of Kel'Thuzad and Kotomine), sought to take over and turn everything into a graveyard for the True Ghost King. Dawn was forced to flee and found druidism, finding her cousins and new friends in order to save her family from themselves and Barrows. Dawn is a sweet and caring individual, a farm girl that likes rural areas, though she is realistic and understands that not everyone can be saved.

**Connor Marke**: The twin brother of Karin, looking like a berserker like their ancestors due to his massive size, but is a very sweet and cuddly Alex Armstong-like/Akhiko Sanada figure, a gentleman and knight that is well-liked by the school. Although initially seeming like a boisterous bruiser, he is instead an overgrown artistic keet that loves to paint. The boyfriend of Mira and best friend of Alistair. He is very kind-hearted which is his weakness, as he is unable to be anything other than soft and unable to make the hard decisions.

**Tristian Miranda ""Mira"" Hughes/Sakurano Miraiyuki**: Mira is the girlfriend of Connor and best friend of Karin. Mira is a samurai squire in the Knights of Aurelius, in the persona of the stoic bifauxen Tristain. Among her friends, Mira is more of a shy and calm yamato nadeshiko that hates violence. Mira is Tskukiguren, a group of Japanese-like people living in Aurelius, her grandfather being Knight-Commander of the Imperial Guard. When her father died without having a son, the eight-year-old Mira was torn from her duties to learn to be a shrine maiden and happy girl like her father wanted with the samurai her grandfather needed and drilled to be one. Torn between the two expectations and becoming a faux action girl because of it, she developed the borderline split personality which came apart when her grandfather realized how badly he screwed up. Mira reconciles herself to be a true action girl and sword maiden/archer, using her bow and and katana to be a speedy blade dancer across the field, able to be peaceful and still protect her friends.

She's lying. 

""first she claimed she was talking about white girls and black guys, when in her original post she stated ""black guy/girls"" are unliked unless it's a fetish. 

Then she claimed it was her way of 'stirring up controversy.' Then she wrote 'I'm black too you know' and added that all her past gfs have been white girls. (As if she was making fun of herself in her original fb comment.) But she wasn't, in that comment she said 'thank god I'm half white that way white girls like me too' followed by statements that white people only love other white ppl or ppl who are mixed with white like herself. Followed by the statement that people only black people as a weird fetish. (Why would she say that about herself? She's stated that she doesn't see herself as 'black' but 'mixed' in the past)

Then she claimed she was 'just talking shit to piss ppl off'

She used various excuses to explain away her problematic post when the truth is pretty clear. She hung out with my sis and I just two days before and didn't have the best time (we were at a gameboard cafe and she was grumpy about losing, then she snapped at me twice checking out Tinder on my phone.)
The following day when I tried to joke with her about the cafe over text she was brief and sarcastic, and then the next day her racist fb comment comes out??? She was mad at us and at least partially inspired by us to write it.

"d6bems3","&gt; Just count the number of red flags there. And that's not all of them, I'm willing to bet, because there were unnamed ""issues"" that have been ""resolved"" from the beginning of the relationship, plus the big cincher that he's a two-faced sociopath who's living a double life, plus myriad issues that you didn't even notice or that haven't surfaced yet. I mean, just from this list: he's severely mentally ill, he can't get along with anyone in his life, he ""compartmentalizes"" (i.e. lies) and is proud of it, and he has a criminal record. Dude, maybe he's just a bad person? Like, a no if or but run of the mill terrible human being? And, what makes me especially stabby, your tandem of common crooks, ahem, ""counselors"", pardon, was perfectly happy to reaffirm your delusion that this was worth fighting for in order to keep taking your money. Saying that there are mental health professionals out there who are just out to take your hard-earned cash really doesn't sit well with me, because I too entrust my mental health to these people, and I too need to trust that my psychologist isn't harming me in order to line her pockets, but if there is market demand for this kind of work, it follows logically that there are people who treat this as a sinecure rather than as a vocation. It's one thing to advise you on your relationship as your individual counselor, and totally a different thing to take a couple on as a couple's counselor, therefore legitimizing the relationship as ""worth working on at all"". I'm sorry, I get you feel strongly about this (I really, really hope you revise your opinion eventually), but I really feel like any counselor who would take on a 6 month old relationship is a charlatan.

I do feel very strongly about couples counseling early in a relationship for any relationship I have in the future. I don't think there is a right or wrong answer here. I did talk about it with my current therapist and she said it would be proactive to initiate counseling at that stage. But we'll clearly just disagree on this. I also strongly disagree that our counselors were in it for the money. Perhaps they should have picked up on some things that they didn't, but they were well-intentioned. I believe most mental health professionals are.

Honestly, not all of those were red flags in the moment, nor do I think they necessarily should have been. DUI? I live in the Midwest, everyone and their mother has one (not saying it's acceptable, just saying it's not something that concerned me much.) And the not being close with his family, talking shit about his friends, compartmentalizing things seemed like standard cynical dude behavior. It does seem that his traumatic childhood stories were mostly true, in which case, I don't blame him for not being close with them. In hindsight, taken in aggregate with everything else, some of these things clearly indicative of his larger mental health issues, but while I was in it, it wasn't so clear-cut. You are correct that he is a bad person, but again, it's easy to look at it from a distance or to look back on it with full information and see that. There were many good things and many things that seemed like positive indications of his commitment that kept me around. I stand by most of the decisions I made while in the relationship.

&gt; Dude, I am so sorry this happened to you, it's why I'm so stabby about this whole thing, but it really isn't a coincidence that most people from difficult pasts end up with difficult futures (or, most people who grew up in abusive households end up in abusive relationships - but lest we get caught in a diction mire again, let's say that that's just an example). I don't think you need to be afraid of the word ""vulnerable"", because you are vulnerable, and it's a good thing. Vulnerability is also strength. You seem to connect very well to people from, as you term it, ""complex"" backgrounds, you seem to have endless compassion for people that others might overlook or reject - and that is a trait that is really rare and valuable, and something to nurture in yourself, at least imho. Most people aren't able to step outside themselves and be compassionate towards someone who is struggling. But your trait comes with a bad side: because you understand on such a visceral level what it's like to feel stigmatized or attacked, be misunderstood, possibly mentally ill, you cut Nick more slack than he deserved. I think you focus too much on how you feel that you can relate to Nick's various problems and how that makes you feel understood and accepted, and not enough on why he has these problems in the first place. In my experience, what people do is less important than how they do it. E.g. there is nothing wrong with living at home per se, but living at home because you got a DUI is a serious problem (the DUI itself is too). There is also nothing wrong per se with not having many friends (I don't!), but if you go around saying how you hate your friends and how you haven't made any friends since college, that would be a hard dealbreaker for me. It's great to be understanding, patient, and compassionate, but not to the point where you allow people to hand-feed you bullshit.

I suppose that's true about vulnerability, I just had a strong reaction to that word because, this being the internet and you/everyone having limited information about me and my situation, I associated the word ""vulnerable"" with immature or disadvantaged somehow. But you're right, I was vulnerable with him, I opened myself and my life up to him and was honest with him about myself and my past and he shit all over it.

You are absolutely right about my compassion for people with complex backgrounds who might otherwise be overlooked. One of the things that drew me to him was how up front he seemed to be about his mental health issues. I've previously dated guys who've lived very vanilla, sheltered lives, and it was very difficult for me to connect with them because they had no frame for conceptualizing the difficult life I've had. Nick did, and he didn't run away from it, and from what I knew, he appeared to be proactively addressing his own mental health issues (with therapy and being open with me - clearly there was more going on than I realized.) I definitely did cut him more slack than he deserved.

Again, the DUI really didn't phase me that much, and my understanding was that he was living at home temporarily so his parents could look after his dog (actually his shared dog with his other girlfriend!) and drive him into the 'burbs for work. He makes a lot of money, so it seemed like a temporary, situational thing that made sense to me. He actually has a lot of friends, and in hindsight I can see his negativity towards them as a symptom of his mental health issues, but I thought it was just him not wanting to be sentimental - he would certainly speak fondly of them when telling stories about things they'd done together.

And you're right, I was patient and compassionate and that allowed him to do this to me, but I'm still going to take issue at you saying I was ""hand fed bullshit.""

"d64w7es","I assume this is a spec script, so I will treat it as such.

Also, I'm not connected to the industry at all. I'm a complete amateur who has attained all knowledge from reading other peoples experiences and advice, so take my suggestions with a huge grain of salt.

All of my suggestions come from the first few pages, but I assume they will apply to the whole script.

You should not refer to the reader, or ""the shot"", or any aspect of the script directly. This only serves to remove the reader from any immersion that you may have achieved. In your first page alone, I see ""Open to see a space ship,"" ""A voice speaks over the shot,"" ""We cut to the bridge of the ship..."", ""The dramatic opening monologue is instantly undercut by the comedy of the next line.""

All of this needs to go, preferably throughout the entire script, but especially in the first 15 pages. If there is one scene where you have some exact vantage point where the camera needs to be, then put it in, but it is very non-standard in spec scripts. I imagine if a reader sees it early on, they will immediately stop and move on, as it indicates unfamiliarity with industry standards.

Also, you should become more comfortable with the screen writing axiom of ""show, don't tell."" For example, the line ""LOLA BARNES , the ship’s medic who seems compassionate but experienced.""

The audience watching the show will never read this line. Either she will be demonstrated as compassionate and experienced through her actions on screen, in which case this line is superfluous, or she won't, in which case this line is wrong.

Another example:

""AUTO is a human looking android unit that seems more human than most of his crew mates. He is at times weird/quirky and has an unhealthy love with the ship.""

The character description is generally for physical appearance only. You need to show the personality of the character through their actions. Make AUTO do something quirky or weird to show his personality.

On a positive note, your characters do seem interesting, and they all appear to have their own voice. It seems like a lot of people have trouble conjuring interesting, organic interactions between their characters, but you don't really have an issue with it. I can't speak to character development, as I don't have time to read the whole thing at the moment, but the introduction to the characters seems solid.",1470367469,"for example, the line ""lola barnes , the ship’s medic who seems compassionate but experienced.""","compassionate but experienced","compassionate","but",FALSE,"compassionate but experienced","experienced",NA,NA,1
"d6458jh","Well, one that's been hard for me is this: if I don't act on sexual desires then I will explode. This is probably one of the hardest theological beliefs I've had in my Christian life. It's not based on the Bible, but it is a belief anyway. 

And I totally hear you about these charismatic gifts. From what I've read, there is a massive infiltration of Satanists into the church, and especially into charismatic Christianity, who are imparting all kinds of demonic possessions and kundalini spirits. There are videos on youtube of Heidi Baker and her putting her hands on this boy who starts to scream and convulse on the floor in ways that definitely look painful, while she's shouting about fire and burning. It's hellish. There are also videos that compare kundalini with Bill Johnson's Bethel Church, with people at the lectern whose heads are wagging violently left and right so much so they can't even talk straight. Eerie similarities to possessions of Eastern spirits in India via yoga and trance meditation. 

I would be concerned with your remark ""whatever floats their boat"", because demonic possession is real, overpowering, deceiving, and the absolute most horrible thing a person can ever go through if they ever make it out alive. Your primal wariness of charismatic gifts is well noted and healthy. 

This doesn't mean that Jesus doesn't heal, or that Jesus' miracles are restricted to the early church - as per cessationism. I myself was the subject of His healing, His power, and His favor to someone who completely destroyed his own mind by his own sins and capitulation - even prayer - to Satan. God is powerful and compassionate. 

But there is a massive wave now of young believers, shallow in learning but strong in zeal, who want sensationalism rather than God, who want miracles and 'the supernatural' rather than relationship with God.

I ultimately believe that Anarchy is possible always, but concede that force dynamics make it impractical at best.

So just work on liking yourself--the first step of which is often to stop being nice to people who don't deserve it. Remain kind and compassionate, but drop nice.

She looked up at the massive bearded man who remained many sizes too big for his chair. She shook her head. “I know why you’re here, and I won’t do it.”

Trent trembled. “Mom—”

Cade lifted a hand and spoke quietly. “I know what you’ve been doing with your letters and messages and texts. I know you love us, but I also know you’re not the type to sit on the sidelines. It’s not in you.”

Casey shook her head harder this time. Her eyes began brimming. “I love it here.” She looked to their guest. “Shaw, you promised we would have a new home far away from everything, and that we could live our lives in happy obscurity.”

Ward remained stoic, saying nothing. His gaze was compassionate, but hard.

“Mom,” Trent said again. “If you can help, you should—and I wanna help, too.”

“No,” she replied, shivering with rising unhappiness at the certainty of what was about to happen. “This was all for you, at its core, at its heart. You deserve a happy childhood.”

“I’m not a child anymore.”

“Oh, but you *are.* Don’t give up your youth so easily.”

“I won’t. But I also know that we can help. It’s what we do, right?”

She simultaneously laughed and sobbed. “When did you grow up all of a sudden?”

Cade took her hand. “You won’t be alone this time. Not ever again. Let’s do this as a family.”

She looked to Lara, who sat in her high chair just out of grasping reach of Shaw’s beard. The huge man still sat unmoving. There was no need for him to say anything at all. His presence here was a symptom, not a cause. Only when the decision had already been wordlessly made did he speak.

“When Noah Fulmer approached me that night so long ago and asked me to keep your secret, I didn’t know if I could,” he stated calmly. “I have chosen to move past what you did to me, but I cannot forgive it. I lost my humanity when you sent me into the Shadow Sphere, and then my family with the Bre’kat when they found out about your control. I had a home with the Zkirax, for a time, but in your absence I followed in your footsteps and made a deal that was necessary for humanity’s survival out here—and when they found out, yes, the Death Oath was a beautiful thing, an act of interspecies compassion, but I alone was exiled from the exiles for what I had done. I have lost *everything,* while you have been allowed this time to live in peace with those you love. I’m not saying you owe me anything, but… it would be nice if we could have you back in the field. After two years of peace, a very precarious time is upon us, and I no longer have any resources with which to struggle.”

She let the tears roll down her cheeks. The good times were over, such as they had been. She couldn’t help but admit a certain excitement at the idea of getting out there again, this time with her husband and her adopted son at her side. But had she ever really believed she would sit out and fade into obscurity? She couldn’t. Even in hiding, even in disguise, even with a new name, she had still taken control of an exodus-wide conspiracy and used it to stay informed.

And something slowly glowed in her heart, like that pulse at the center of the frozen Empire. It had come upon her like a creeping heat over the last two years; most sharply while thinking about the millions of pictures in the Lost Tunnels, and while telling the story of Kumari’s father. She remembered him, now that she thought about it. He had asked her, *Is all this really what you wanted when you came out here?*, and she had paused, because it had absolutely not been what she had wanted. She had hoped for isolation, for peace, but starving and beleaguered refugees had begun pouring in, and she had continued to do what she had always done—and something wonderful had grown here because of it.

For so long, everything had been about protecting the ones she loved, but Laura was long gone, and now at peace. If she were to lose her husband or her adopted son or even her own life, that seemed alright now in the face of what was needed. It was them—all those people out there—all the Neil Yadavs and Ranis and Kumaris and Showmans and Canteys and Mashburns and even the Graysons—she was soaring up through the clouds, streaking up through the heavens through layers upon layers of dark storm clouds to emerge into the streaming sun. By her own estimation, Laura’s death had taken some vital essence from her and turned her into a hateful cosmic plague on the human race, but now, thanks to the love and peace of so many wonderful people, her humanity had been revived.

“You’re wrong, Ward,” she finally said, her tears now born of happiness and freedom rather than long-held despair. “I do owe you. This house is yours, and the people of Concord are your neighbors.”

He raised his bushy eyebrows.

“Under one condition,” she said, sighing away deep emotions. “Take care of Lara while we’re out.”

He nodded toward her adopted son. “As I guarded him, so shall I guard her.”

Trent high fived him across the table.

“But there’s one other thing you should know,” Ward said, his tone hushed as if someone was listening. “I am not here at random. After years of solitude on the open sea, I felt the eyes of the unknown watcher from the future upon me. I sailed back and then ran here as fast as I could—and I was right. The moment you entered the room, I felt it again. You’re being watched.”

A chill ran up her spine. “Family, we’ve got our first crisis. Let’s go.” She grabbed Lara, and, together, the five of them sought out the laptops at the entrance area of the building. Leaning down, she checked the random number generators that they had left running continuously ever since Senator Brace’s realization that someone had been watching them from the future and attempting to alter the timeline through some form of probability alteration. “What do you have?”

Trent studied the laptop he had opened. “This one’s saying it too. The average of the die roll should be three and a half, right?”

“Yeah. What’s it at?” Her numbers were similar: when a roll of one counted as failure and a roll of six meant success as arbitrary conditions, the average represented the generalized probability field, or so she had hoped.

“For the last several hours it’s dipped to two.” He stepped back. “Now it’s one point nine.”

“Luck has turned against us,” she whispered, her thoughts grasping for some nearly coherent revelation. In the distance, they began to hear a commotion. Running to the torch-lit main road as a group, they were quickly privy to the big news. The Waystation was reporting the first return of human beings from the next base branch they had ever seen; Carmen Faulkner of Vanguard fame had arrived exhausted and at the end of her strength with a baby boy on her back, and, an hour after her appearance, now hundreds of men and women were emerging from the rift and making their way across that final valley.

Ward Shaw had sensed it first, but Casey could feel it in her soul: the book was back.

She watched the celebrating farmers both alive and dead by the dancing light of the torches. It was her own Doctrine, really, that said humanity must survive by carefully balancing cosmic destructive forces against one another. By the stories the refugees traded, she herself had become such a mythical force, and perhaps that meant they all had a chance against what was coming. She also guessed that the book itself was nothing but a tool, but that tool was undeniably gwellion in nature, and the presence of a gwellion somehow always meant very bad things. “If the herald is back, then an equal force must rise to meet what is coming,” she murmured.

Cade squeezed her hand. “Go.”

She could already see her target. Pushing through the crowd, she greeted Senator Brace with an open palm instead of the knife she had intended when he had suggested capturing and torturing her parents. “Edgar.”

He was always visibly happy to see his mentor. “Yes?”

She pulled him away from the commotion. “We need to talk about this plan to go after Cristina Thompson’s parents.”

He moved close to the wooden wall of the Forum and looked around to make sure nobody was nearby in the dark night. “I feel pretty shit about it, too, but the stakes are too high. We need everyone’s cooperation. Kendrick messaged and said he promises he’ll get Her Glory to show up, but we need the Grey Riders, too.”

Holding back her initial plan to confess, Casey studied her mentee’s face. “What is it? What have you been secretly working on all this time?”

“You could tell?” He seemed surprised at her perception, but not altogether so.

“Yes.”

He studied the nearby crowd to gauge their attention, took her by the wrist, and led her quickly between the maze of fresh wooden buildings that had only grown more complex in recent days. Remaining furtive without coming off as abnormal to anyone who might happen by, Brace removed a padlock from an unassuming but sturdily built storage barn and slipped inside. Intrigued, but not alarmed, she followed.

Ryker Gale-

Age: 17 Gender: Male Appearance: 5’11”, Pale skin, long black hair, Sea green eyes, scared arms, skinny build, Human

Description: Kind, Compassionate, but super serious when it’s time to be. Loves dark humor and jokes at the expense of others, but not when it would hurt them (unless he hates them, which almost never happens.) Protective of the ones he loves and will do almost anything for them to see they smile. Extreme realist at times; loves exploration and nature. Extremely patient, but has a definitive tipping point. Extremely determined when he has goals set in mind.

Preferred weapons: Anything with a long reach, he despises swords with a passion but will use one out of necessity. Distrustful to magic, as it was used in his torture, but is tolerant to it and even fascinated by it at times

----------------

Aaron Gale-

Age: 15 Gender: Male Appearance: 5’6”, Dark skin, short brown hair, blue eyes, scared arms, skinny build, Human

Description: Curious, innocent, and loving to a fault. Is too much of a jokester at times, but can be serious. Loves puns above all other forms of comedy and hates to hurt others, even at risk to himself. Naïve child at times, he often gets lost in his fantasies, especially when they involve his brother. He is not very patient, often fidgeting around when waiting for short periods of time; never angers except when his family is being threatened. 

Preferred weapons: Loves the sword, and is quite talented too but this often gets him chastised by Ryker for his poor weapon choice. 100% obsessed with magic and will do most anything to learn it, despite its use in his torture.

---------------

Anjali Normaksdaughter-

Age: 2021 (or about 16 for a human) Gender: Female Appearance: 6’2”, Tan skin, long braided blonde hair, brown eyes, athletic build, 6” ears, Elf

Description: Loyal, kind, but lazy and aloof. She will often forget what her orders are because of her laziness, but when her mind is focused she is extremely determined. Has a mixed sense of humor, loving dad jokes and puns as well as dark humor on occasions. She hates violence with a passion, often jeopardizing entire missions just to save innocents; the only reason she hasn’t been fired or killed is because of her incredible speed and combat abilities. Curious to a fault, loves learning new things but never quite picks up on them quickly. Patience is her strongest attribute, being able to wait for weeks without hesitation. While her fuse is short, she burns out fast and is quick to forgive most transgressions; unless of course her loved ones are being threatened.

Preferred weapons: Reloading rifles and snipers, talented beyond all other elves in the realm of marksmanship, but does pitifully in magic.

"d5ffpep","My best friend is a liberal Bernie (now reluctant Hillary) supporter.

He's a good guy with a super good heart.  He tends to want to support things that *sound* good and compassionate, but he does more than the average liberal in that he *actually* donates a lot of his time and money into causes he cares about.  Honestly he might be the nicest, most forgiving and generous person I've ever met in my life.

I think where it goes wrong for him is that he's one of those feelings over facts people.  He has this innate desire to root for the underdog (i.e. minorities), and he likes to give people the benefit of the doubt.

"d4t9fwp","&gt; Obviously, I mean character defects defined by their poor choices. Superman finds himself at odds with Batman because he chooses to abdicate responsibility for his actions and becomes a tool for the government.

Superman doesn't make ""poor choices"" in TDKR. He's a psychopath, and a damn terrifying one at that. Superman becomes exactly the thing Lex was scared of him becoming. There have been ""Justice Lords"" versions of Superman that weren't just more compassionate, but more sane, than that. In TDKR, he is legitimately the most terrifying villain the Justice League has ever faced, sans the Anti-Monitor or Darkseid.

On the other hand, there have been plenty of times where Superman has made what I would consider ""poor choices."" For example, many of the times when he allows incredibly dangerous supervillains to live, I think he's making incredibly poor choices, and more than a few times, I'm proven right, outside anything Frank Miller ever wrote.

That's the problem with thinking that things like ""character flaws"" or ""bad decisions"" make a character more human or relate-able. One person's character flaw, is another person's virtue. What makes a character human is that they demonstrate the capacity for growth, positive or negative, even if in the end they do not in fact grow.

Take Rey from *The Force Awakens* for example. She makes bad decision after bad decision, but doesn't demonstrate any capacity for a shift in perspective, at all. She fails to, as one of my favorite writers puts it, ""acquire more reality."" I'm hopeful however, that a lot of her personal journey is being saved for Episode VIII, similar to how much of Luke's personal journey was saved for TESB.

&gt; Batman has obviously become more violent and less restrained, succumbing to harsher and harsher punishments for those that cross him because of how little he can actually do to effect change with idealistic methods.

None of that sounds like poor decision-making to me. That sounds like Batman seeing a problem and adjusting his methods to fix it. I call it smart problem-solving. See what I mean?

&gt; Before, they were able to use their super powers, not kill anyone,

Batman and Superman both have killed plenty of people before Frank Miller ever put pen to paper. *Man of Steel* wasn't the first time he killed Zod. Superman killing Zod is practically a DC tradition. He's killed other Kryptonians before, and not just in the heat of battle. He executed them, brutally, sat there and watched them die slowly from kryptonite to make sure the deed was done properly.

Perhaps more famously, Batman once executed a crazy person by hanging them by their neck from a rope, attached to his Batwing that he was flying around. When asked what the fuck was wrong with him, Batman responded ""He's better off this way.""

I don't know how familiar you are with the various folks that have held the mantle of Robin over the years, but Batman pretty much fucks up hardcore with every single one of them, especially Jason Todd, who, I would argue, was more flawed as a person than any other Robin in history, so much so that instead of sticking him in a costume, Batman should have stuck him in a mental institution.

&gt; in a more realistic world.

It was a world where Ronald Reagan started an open war with Russia instead of laying the groundwork for peace.

If you want to see Batman and Superman as multi-faceted, layered personalities (that's what actually makes a good character, not how many dumb/evil things they do) I'd highly recommend Grant Morrison's work, especially *All-Star Superman*. That is, in my opinion, Superman at his most human. He gets jealous. He's afraid for the future. He suffers lose of friends, relatives, and even a beloved pet. He also gets the Kryptonian equivalent of cancer. How he deals with all these different situations is what adds depth to his character.

I think Batman is at his best when he's the patriarch of the ""Bat Family."" Most of those stories are also, incidentally, written by Grant Morrison, the guy who I think is currently DC's best writer, and the second best writer they've ever had, behind Steve Gerber.

I'm not going to bust your balls for liking something I don't like, or insult your taste, or anything like that. I just don't think TKDR was that good as far as the technical craft of writing goes, and for a more personal taste-based critique, I didn't find the story all that engaging.",1467241728,"there have been ""justice lords"" versions of superman that weren't just more compassionate, but more sane, than that.","compassionate, but more","compassionate","but",TRUE,"more compassionate , but more sane","sane","more","more",1

So I have a couple of Inquisitors 

**Evelyn Trevelyn**: My canon and personal favorite. She was a mage disowned by her family when her magic surfaced at the age of 10. The friends she made in the Circle are all dead. She's dealt with some really fucked up stuff but she's never let that taint her soul. She's still a very idealistic and pure person and will always try and save people no matter what the personal cost. 

She cares deeply about everyone in the Inquisition as they are basically the first true family she's ever had. She's very anti-Chantry so she doesn't believe she's the Herald of Andraste, but claimed she was because that's who people needed her to be. 

After the Inquisiition, she married the love of her life, Josephine, and moved to Antiva with her. They would eventually have one daughter through magical conception, Leliana Elymra Montilyet. 

**Elanil Lavellan**: A Dalish mage who never really found a place where she belonged. She cares deeply about her people, but doesn't know the best way to help them. She can be closed off but she's very friendly to the people she's close to. She's very direct as she likes getting things done efficiently. She also has a really intense temper so don't piss her off. She eventually marries Cullen.

**Zela Cadash**: A brutal Carta member who was in the wrong place at the wrong time. She does what needs to be done and really doesn't care who gets in her way. In her mind, everyone is out for themselves so she just does what she does to survive. She helped the Inquisition because the Breach was a threat to her. She developed a bit of a heroic streak during her time as Inquisitor, though she doesn't realize it yet. She romanced no one

 **Elymra Lavellan**: In my canon universe, she was Evelyn's closest friend but was killed during the mage rebellion. But in this universe, she was never sent to the Circle and eventually became the Inquisitor. She's extremely maternal and cares deeply about people. She's also tries to stand up for the oppressed whenever she can. She romanced Solas but we all know how that works out. 

**Fayette Trevelyan**: Evelyn's sister. She's a devout Andrastian but she struggles with some of the Chantry's dogma, especially around magic (since her sister is a mage). She's very kind and compassionate but her incredible privilege makes it so that she can be very unaware of the struggles of people around her. Romances Cullen.

"d3zw2kl","Most hospitals have a volunteer service/program. Tell them how interested you are in nursing. In my area, they love students and anyone interested in it and many times pair them up with an RN to shadow and a CNA.  

When you shadow an RN, really be interested in what they do. Observe what their day is like and don't be afraid to ask questions.  Being an RN can be stressful and it all comes down to how YOU handle stress that comes with the job.  You need to handle different personalities, handle difficult patients, etc.  

If you are a shy type, doesn't want to mingle so much or way too silent you'll find yourself burnt out. Nursing requires you to be flexible, compassionate, but also resilient and assertive. No one starts off perfect as a new RN. You learn along the way and nothing is better than experience and the willingness to learn, most especially acceptance that you never stop learning.  

The volunteering experience will tell you if you have the heart for nursing or not. Only you can make the call, not any of us here. Even if you do go to nursing school, no one is telling you to work in the hospital. However even if you work in something like community health outside of the hospital you do need your skillset and that still involves blood/needles, just not as ""grotesque"" as you might see in say a hospital.

If you work in a clinic or doctors office you will still be handling needles or see something invasive.  I think you should ask yourself why you see yourself as an RN, why is it a viable route for you? There are no perfect conditions in nursing school or on the job and the faster you realize that, the better you'll get at adapting to whatever circumstances you are thrown in.  

I also know people who never thought could be an RN, people that thought blood was ""icky"" and needles looked scary but they seriously needed job security and one that was fulfilling and their old job just was not cutting it.  So they sacrificed time and money to work hard in an RN program and made it. Now these same people i know are currently doing their masters! They adapted quickly, learned the routines and got over their fears.  So do you need to be super passionate about being an RN like it's a vocation? Not necessarily. However there needs to be interest and a willingness to work as one.

"d3wb5dm","&gt; While I love Garnet to death and consider her my favorite Gem, I can't help but think that she's just as unhealthy of a relationship as Malachite. Ruby and Sapphire just plain CANNOT function if they're apart, which is honestly raising a lot of red flags with me.

Absolutely correct, Garnet even draws other Gems into her Fusion and it causes problems ( Sardonyx and Sugilite ). Her reactions are often funky and compassionate, but they're also mechanical and precise: she's specifically aware of how many problems Need to be solved and most often let's others experience the exact amount of trial and error they need to rather than communicating what needs to be done.

IMO Rose used Garnet's Fusion as an ""Answer"" for how to learn to beat Homeworld. She desired the secret of cross-gem fusion and Cotton-candy mom would ""stay just as (she) is"" to tell her how. Rainbow-Quartz was probably the first Fusion in Rose's army.

"d3rsfur","I know exactly what you mean. There are similarities in my situation - I am, by all estimations, a successful person, both as my family life as partner and parent, and in business as a design consultant running my own business. Beyond that, I am simply a good person - I have principles, I have good values, I am liberal, considerate, polite and compassionate. But I feel like all of that would be thrown out the window if I came out to my brothers and especially my parents and father-in-law. 

I came out to my wife as gender fluid earlier this year, and last week, escalated that to true trans, following affirmation of my feelings by a therapist.

"d3m5urx","I as well have had this issue many times, and the rule you need to live by is simple, dont let them in to far, and dont socialize with people who do not understand you unless you can or want to help them in some way, do not get to close or involved but be compassionate and understanding.

When your awake what do you do with other people who are in a much lower state? You view them as child like, but you dont treat them like children but you remember that they will make mistakes and to not let it harm you.

Another thing you need to remember is to make sure it isnt your ego talking or even fear, if you have been hurt allot like me, it can be hard to distinguish when you are being intuitive or just fearful to the point your ego starts telling you that you know they will betray you because your protecting yourself.

If you need to sit down and medtiate and ask yourself, is it you or are you really getting bad vibes from them? You can be cautious without deciding fully, but do be careful.

And no one saids you have to fully accept people for who they are, yes you can accept to an extent but it isnt an excuse for them not to grow many people choose it, they are not only hurting themselves when they are causing harm to others. As I said be understanding and compassionate, but dont bend over backwards for people who dont want to grow, save that for people who do, sometimes the best you can do is inspire and live by example. Besides that is how you teach real kids anyways is living by example adults are not that different when it comes to spiritual growth.

"d3kkiqw","If you're a fan who read the comics it isn't hard at all to take knowledge gained from previous stories and construct a framework where BvS is totally fine.

New Superman who hasn't been accepted by the world he protects. He is both compassionate but selfish in that he wishes to help people but wonders if he should. This is a Superman before he accepts his place in the pantheon of heroes. Cavill did a great job.

10 years after the Joker murders Jason Todd, 2nd Robin, we have a Batman who has begun to go off the deep end. He knows this, he acknowledges this, and he does all he can to prevent the evils he has seen from happening again. This is not an Adam West Batman, this is a Batman who has had the good taken from him and all we have left is an angry man hell bent on preventing another tragedy like we saw in MoS.

Wonder Woman will get more exposure in her solo movie but she should have been more involved. My only real gripe.

Doomsday was better than I expected but felt wasted on this movie as he should have been used later once the world loved Superman. As it stands we lost a good plot point for a later movie.

Lex Luther is not the Lex Luther we all know. He is Alexander Luther Jr, Lex's son, and that is why he acts weird. He is the son of a rich and powerful man, he is neurotic, and he is egotistical.

"d3irzzu","Fire Emblem has plenty of scheming sorcerers. Arvis is one of the better ones.

But Fire Emblem has no one like the Black Knight, who finds himself juggling all sorts of roles even beyond his dual identity as the right hand man of two different (mentally unstable) villains. He's partly a Gharnef, killing parents and kidnapping maidens, invincible to all but a single blessed weapon. He's partly a Camus, carrying out his duty to an evil empire  as ethically as he possibly can. And he's got quite a bit of Soren in him, wrestling with subhuman prejudice and [FE10] (#s ""his own laguz heritage making him an outcast"") and looking up to Greil just as much as Soren does to Ike. 

Yes, Arvis has an overpowered Crusader Weapon, and le Sigurd jokes and whatnot. But what the Black Knight lacks in raw power or meme potential, he makes up for with unparalleled complexity and depth as a *character*, not just a boss. And he would never let himself get deceived by the likes of Manfroy - the Black Knight is more aware of the politics and power struggles of Tellius than anyone else in the series, even his immortal master.

[FE10](#s ""Zelgius"") is both cunning and honorable, ruthless and compassionate, but what makes him the most interesting is how each scene he's in shows a different side of him. One moment he teleports from across the world and stabs his foe in the back, another moment he hands his enemy the key to defeating him. But none of this is from an erratic personality or shoddy writing - it all follows naturally from who he is and what his obligations lead him to in that particular moment. The worst thing that can be said about the Black Knight as a villain is that his presence alone shits all over Ashnard, who should in theory be the main villain.

So if this is, as the legions of low-effort replies in this thread would assume, a question of who is the **strongest enemy**, then yeah, Arvis wins because his weapon is broken and he isn't weak against hammers. But if this really is just a matter of number-crunching, we might as well cut to the chase and hand the whole tournament to [FE13](#s ""Apotheosis!Anna""). Is that really how we want to look at these these matchups?

But if it's a question of who makes a better **character**, then the Black Knight wins against yet another [Well-Intentioned](http://i241.photobucket.com/albums/ff110/SenpaiSandy/Fire%20Emblem/Lyon0.jpg) [Mage Guy](http://orig15.deviantart.net/e2a4/f/2012/330/1/f/profile_picture_by_ask_sephiran-d5m9h0n.png). In a series that relies so often on archetypes, formulas, and sometimes even one-dimensional bullshit like Iago and the Fire Dragon, I must endorse the villain with enough diversity and depth to rival the entire rest of the series, let alone one single Emperor.

And let's face it, guys - he's [hotter than Valflame](http://i3.pixiv.net/img-original/img/2014/10/05/23/49/54/46378890_p0.png).",1464156902,"[fe10](#s ""zelgius"") is both cunning and honorable, ruthless and compassionate, but what makes him the most interesting is how each scene he's in shows a different side of him.","ruthless and compassionate","compassionate",NA,FALSE,"ruthless and compassionate","ruthless",NA,NA,0

2) Incompetence turns me off. If I try to speak with someone, it can be very frustrating trying to talk in layman's terms.

3) I don't have a particularly strong memory. I can sometimes remember random little details here and there but I usually have to put a lot of effort into memorization. When I speak about past events, I usually describe it with as much detail as I can remember.

4) I spend most of my time thinking about the future, and occasionally the past. I don't think about the present too much unless I am very anxious.

5) I wouldn't mind listening someone talk to me about video games I like or about some really cool science topics.

6) Video games and science lol

7) It depends on the person. I am not likely to confront someone unless they are someone close to me and I feel more comfortable talking to. If I do confront them, I will tell them that I disagree with them and list the reasons why I disagree with them. I would try to see their point of view as well and try to be as open minded as possible.

8) I am not super interested int trying new things but I am definitely very willing to try these new things if given the opportunity. I don't like to do things like this very often. For example, going to an amusement park and riding roller coasters all day can be fun but I wouldn't want to just go skydiving or do anything crazy the next day. I think I would need to take a break.

I am intelligent and compassionate, but really believe that I would never be in the running for any job that I would want or any relationship that I would want because I am so ugly. People who don't know me start laughing sometimes when I walk by.

I spent a lot of my life saying ""screw it, nothing you do matters when you look so repulsive."" I have always done the minimum to get by, but I have a college degree and have never been unemployed, so I'm not an idiot. I have always taken whatever job would hire me and never gone after what I really want because I feel people would take one look at me and run. I don't pursue dating at all and made that decision when I was 12. Guys want nothing to do with me. They're either out of my league to begin with or don't want to settle for someone like me even if they're in my league. I have to say- one pro of being repulsive is that you don't get hit on unwantedly. I am basically invisible. I don't talk to anyone that I don't have to, and no one talks to me unless they have to.

My only goal throughout most of my life has been to make it through the day so I can go home and watch TV. I never bothered to take care of my body because I thought it would betray me regardless. No matter what I did I still felt ugly.

I'm aware that this post makes me sound like the quintessential loser (which is true- I gave up when I was 12 and have just been following the education/career path my parents expect with no true passion for any of it).

"d33f1vh","This is very controlling behavior and huge red flag. You need to take immediate action in this situation because the longer you allow your relationship dynamic to remain this way, the harder it will be for you to regain your independence and autonomy.

Obviously, a lot of people are going to suggest that this relationship dynamic seems pretty disturbing and you might consider ending it. A person who feels like they can and should control their partner's behavior typically has some unhealthy traits. So, I would consider it. You're only 20 and that's an age where you start to really define your relationship and intimacy style. This might not be a good person to be doing that with. 

With that said, if you choose to try to work on it with him, you MUST set some boundaries. You have to have a very direct conversation with him about what is not acceptable treatment. 

""I understand that you care about me and are concerned about my wellbeing but I have the right to go to things by myself."" ""I will do my best to keep you aware of my plans for the day but I am not okay with you going everywhere with me."" ""I feel controlled when you get angry after I say I want to go out by myself."" ""I am here for you to listen to your anxieties about safety but I will not completely change my life to accommodate them.""   ...... These are all examples of boundary statements. 

Remember: A boundary is a clear and firm line drawn between acceptable and unacceptable behavior. The best boundaries are explained with some empathy for the other person, but also advocacy for yourself. It isn't a punishment. In fact, it's a very positive thing: You're giving very clear instructions into how a person can change their behavior to create a happier relationship and what exactly that person could do to cross the line. Structure can be a very comforting thing, especially in the chaos of relationships. However, a boundary is only as valuable as your ability to enforce it. If someone crosses your boundary and you don't hold your end of the bargain, you're empowering them to continue to walk over your line.... Great boundary statements often follow an ""IF....THEN"" pattern. 

""If I continue to feel like I don't have the freedom to go out by myself, then I won't feel very safe in this relationship."" This is an example of that pattern. 

Look out for the second big red flag: Big anger outbursts and huge fights in response to boundaries are a form of emotional abuse. Your partner should never scare you out of setting boundaries. Your partner should never make you feel extremely guilty about setting boundaries. If you stand up for yourself in a compassionate, but respectful way, and your partner responds with a huge emotional outburst that leaves you feeling bewildered, unsettled, or guilty.... That's not good. 

I don't know your situation. I am certainly not trying to assume abuse without knowing your situation. But I will say that controlling behavior is often a warning sign. So, again, take swift action so that it doesn't escalate. Be kind to yourself by standing up for yourself. Ask your partner to treat you the way you would treat your partner. 

I hope everything works out for you and good luck!

"d2v889h","My son is 3, and the words I live by for toddlers is ""They aren't giving you a hard time, they're having a hard time.""  

I absolutely hate what you describe your father doing.  I absolutely abhor the flexing of authority for the mere sake of showing power.  I personally think it's trending toward abusive to give a child an irrelevant command, and then threaten to hit them for not obeying it.  At a minimum, it teaches the child nothing that's positive or useful in my opinion, unless simply mind-fucking your child until you break them into rote compliance is your goal.  

Now, look, I'm not defending bratty obstinancy in children.  But here's my goal with my kid - I want him to be pleasant, cooperative and compassionate, but also assertive about his feelings and needs.  I want him to trust and respect my guidance and authority, but I'm happy with a give-and-take.  I'm very happy to recognize situations that I can 'give' by satisfying my son's requests, and demonstrate to him the value of compromise in a two-way relationship.

Yes, some things are non-negotiable.  There are capital-R Rules that we require he follow.  There are a lot of them, to be honest.  But all in all they are designed toward the goal I set forth above, toward maintaining a healthy, happy home, and he mostly complies with them willingly.  

I know mothers are often indulgent toward their children and might tolerate stuff others would criticize.  I regularly ask his preschool teachers and other adults who spend time with him how he behaves when I'm not around and how they evaluate his strengths/weaknesses.  Every once in awhile they tell me he had a bad day, and we work on the problem.  But I've heard that *overall* he shows empathy to kids who are upset, offers his friendship to kids who are lonely and leads them into a game, offers to clean up toys, uses good manners and complies with behavior requests. 

I do a lot of modeling the behaviors I want to see.  I do a lot of listening.  He's 3 and doesn't tantrum much, he does name and verbalize his feelings and suggest solutions to the problems.  If I hear and respond to this and engage with him, he likely will agree to my proposed suggestion.  Not perfectly, not without attempts to whine or negotiate, but generally I would say he's very low on the 'brat' scale.

We use time out when we need to.  Hitting is always an instant ticket to time out.  Time outs are 1 minute per year of age, in a specific time out spot and he is ignored but not isolated.  If he calms down and gets a problem-solving orientation before the timer goes, he gets let out early.  

This is super long, and I'm sorry for writing a book, but all of this goes into how we shape his attitude.  He's a really pleasant kid and  I do think some of that is inborn traits (low defiance, etc.) and not just parenting techniques.  Other kids might be more challenging, I'm sure I was becauswe I am very stubborn and obstinate.

"d2nwot2","Yes! I'll give you some tips on both volunteering as well as getting into OHSU...

Volunteering:
It's actually pretty easy to get in somewhere with them. Just [apply here](http://www.ohsu.edu/xd/health/services/doernbecher/how-to-help/volunteer/apply-to-be-volunteer.cfm). They require a commitment of 4 hours a week for 6 mos on whatever hospital unit they place you on. All they need to see is that you're dependable and generally personable. To get on a better, more advanced unit though (rather than just sitting at the information desk for 6 mos), you need to show them you can handle additional pressure. When you eventually meet 1-on-1 with one of the volunteer coordinators, tell them stories from personal experience about how you've handled crazy pressures (especially from work situations). I told a true story about my previous work experience in physical therapy, where I was able to handle a ton of patients at once -- way more than normal -- during a crazy busy time by communicating very well with my one peer coworker, which ultimately showed that I'm great at communicating and working on a team, and don't bend under pressure. I told another story about another patient I worked with for months who was very high needs, and this demonstrated that I am very compassionate even with patients that are easy to lose patience with.

Getting into OHSU SoN:
There are seven main factors that I can think of...

* Strong grades. I'd be lying if I said this wasn't important. In all my pre-req classes, I had only one A-, all the rest were A's. I'd strongly recommend applying many places, and then re-taking classes to get A's until you get in. I worked my ass off for two years for this, and so can you. My earlier grades were bad...I had D's and F's and W's even. My cumulative though, due to better grades the last 2 years, was 3.38 at the time I got admitted to OHSU.
* Work experience in healthcare was certainly helpful, but not required. Volunteering is a good alternative, but if I were starting fresh I'd probably get my CNA2 license, or work as a HUC, or similar.
* They want to know you are culturally sensitive / can handle working with diverse populations without discrimination
* They want to know you are truly empathetic and compassionate, but can maintain healthy boundaries with patients.
* They want to know you have strong leadership abilities.
* They want to know you know exactly why you want to be in nursing. Not just ""I want to help people."" Why do you want to be a nurse, and not a PA, an MD, a DO, or any one of the other health professions? What have you done to show that you are truly set on this course, and ultimately won't drop out of their program?
* They want to hear about the life experiences you've had which have made a profound impact on your desire to be a nurse. The more you can make a genuine, honest, emotional impact on them with your life story leading up to your interview, and can elaborate on the passions in you that will fuel your nursing journey, the better. 

For all of these things, it is MUCH better to be able to share true STORIES to answer these and other questions they might ask about, than to simply share your personal thoughts or beliefs. In the interview they ask you five questions, and then in the proctored essay afterward they ask you two questions, and I believe each of these questions is touched upon in my five points above. I truly believe I got in because I shared relevant stories that showed not only that I knew what I was getting into, but also that I have deep, meaningful relevant experiences that have fueled my passion for going into nursing, while some other applicants just shared theoretical answers / thoughts of theirs, if that makes sense.

Anyway, hope this helps! Let me know if there's any other questions I can help with.

"d2le9d2","I *adore* Rose in Bloom (as well as the first half of the story, Eight Cousins - I am a big Lousia May Alcott fan, and a BIG fan of classic literature).

Anyway, Mac stole my heart at the age of 10. 

He. 

Stole. 

My. 

Heart. 

I blame this character for giving me my personal idealized and perfect man and my love of nerds - Mac really *is* everything I look for in a guy. He's very smart (a genius actually), but humble. He's kind but is awkward. He's compassionate but firm willed. He's got great morals but he doesn't force people to live like he believes - though he's not afraid of speaking his mind. He's blunt, honest and shrewd - but he's loving and not judgmental. 

One of my favorite chapters in the book was *Polishing Mac* - the entire thing was adorable and hilarious, but Alcott tactfully shows that for all his positives, Mac really needs major social skills and how to better take care of himself. But she does it in this thoroughly entertaining and sweet way - you can't help but love Mac to death with all his awkwardness and how dreadfully uncomfortable and absentminded he is at the ball. 

I thought his characterization for the book was spot on and his growth was so well written: he matures, develops and turns into a man but he never loses his quirks, personality or just what makes Mac well, *Mac*. He just gets polished up and smoothed down. 

I think he's one of the best written child to teen to adult characters and characterizations I've come across and most certainly one of my favorites. Put both **Eight Cousins** and **Rose in Bloom** together and it is really great to see how Mac grows up from book to book. I also think he and Rose (who I am *very* fond of as well) are one of the best couples I've ever come across. I honestly don't care that they're cousins and it never bothered me considering the 1800's setting and more so - just how *perfect* they are for each other. They really bring out the best in each other and I am eternally thankful that Rose did *not* end up with Charlie.

From the same book, I also love the side pairings of Archie/Phebe (so nice to see the head of the wealthy cousins patiently wait for and fall in love with Phebe, former servant girl - I found that very touching, how faithful they were to each other regardless of major social class divide). 

I also really like Steve with Kitty - I loved how pompous Steve was while at the same time he has such a good, well meaning heart. And Kitty was perfect for him because like the book says, despite her having a flighty head, being engaged twice before the age of 18 and being a little spoiled - she's a sweet girl who knows she's faulted and wants to improve. Again, they make each other better. 

I always loved Alcott's ability to write such memorable and convincing couples for her stories. Couples in her books are pretty much my ideal because they make each other better and always bring out the best in the other. It is really refreshing to read about these sorts of clean-cut couples, rather than always delve into ""the bad boy"" or ""brooding hero"" things like that.

 You are not a terrible person for missing her or still caring.  Before she did this, she was someone you loved and now you have lost that person.  It takes time to grieve and mourn.   



What you should NOT do is let Alexa or her family drag you down.  Her begging you and saying ""please don't give up on me"" strikes me as manipulative, especially since it seems her family is still in the picture.

This is a fitness test. If you start passing fitness tests sober, she'll start to test you when drinking. If you pass those, she'll start drinking with you so you get comfortable, then test you. Until you can recognize and respond to those tests, you need to watch your drinking, even (and especially) when she's drinking, too.

&gt; We were having a nice dinner and out of no where she accused me of being aggressive

Her: ""You're aggressive""

You: ""You're welcome""

Her: ""What?""

You: ""I thought it was a compliment. My steak is delicious!""

There's two options here. She's a complete sociopath who will say and do anything to manipulate you. These people exist, I've met them. It's highly, highly doubtful this is the explanation for your wife.

It's highly likely your wife is experiencing serious medical health issues. This is not a normal thing to think or say, and she's telling you because she wants you to lead her in getting help. You need to continue to work on bettering yourself and you need to get her professional help immediately so that she can work on bettering herself. Hug her, kiss her, tell her that you will both get through this.

Imagine what a normal person would do, and do that. Be compassionate, but firm that she has to get help immediately. Don't be a ""nice guy"", and hope the problem will go away so you don't have to deal with it. Don't be a stoic alpha jackass. Just act like you have a family member that needs help, and compassionately but firmly help her.

"d2dhlll","I know what harm reduction is and have extensively posted on that previously in this subreddit, as well as numerous other therapeutic techniques. Harm reduction can be initially useful, but ultimately, long term treatment needs to involve a lack of avoidance. Normal people don't obsessively pick at pimples and other perceived flaws, hence my repeating that the issue isn't your skin, but your obsession with it and your compulsive picking as a result. CSP isn't considered an addiction, like alcohol for example, which is chemical and has elements of habituation. CSP is habitual in part (though, that's the minor part - if it was as simple as a habit, people could break it) and part of the OCD-anxiety spectrum. Avoidance of triggers, in this case, is not the solution, though it may provide a reduction, it is a crutch and can prevent further progress. The issue isn't the blemishes.

It is worrisome to see people repeatedly engaging in reassurance seeking behaviour without check because it causes a continuation of the obsession by validating those mental pathways, further entrenching them and making treatment more difficult, and other people in the community see this, and then post their own such threads. Such behaviour is banned on the OCD subreddit, for example, and discouraged on most of the other OCD subtype, anxiety, related disorders subreddits. It's upsetting to see so many people engaging in behaviour that could be detrimental to their treatment, and others' treatment as well, by association.

I'm being clear and forceful in my word choice because there is clear enabling here, and this community shouldn't be enabling the CSP of its members struggling with this, it should be actively arming people with information and discouraging compulsive and habitual behaviour. I am trying to be compassionate, but also clear that people shouldn't be encouraged to do this, that this is detrimental, and sounding the alarm on that.

It's not on you to manage what your siblings understand (or don't understand). It's not on you to show the world her crazy. Believe me, she shows it plenty enough on her own. People who are good to you and who love you will believe it when you say your mother is not well. Your father knows, but again it isn't your job to stop him from being an enabler.

&gt;He complains constantly despite being born into the wealthiest family on the planet.

You mean he complains about how his father had his wife raped by his entire garrison to prove a point to him? I mean sure, he's also angry about being denied Casterly Rock, but that was clearly more about being respected by his father. Why is having daddy issues such a crime? 

&gt;Tyrion shows pity to Penny, he is not kind to her

Disagree. There are numerous times when leaving Penny behind would have *helped* Tyrion, but he kept with her. That isn't just pity.

&gt;He also threatens to rape Tommen.

To keep Alayaya safe. Just making the threat sickened him. But surely you know this? I'm starting to suspect there's some serious bias coming from you here...

Arguably his worst act, and yet I can't find myself to blame him, after what Tywin did to him. I certainly don't see it as 'villainous'.

Uh... are you reading a different series to me? He is *clearly* hated for being a dwarf. I won't deny he's sarcastic, but cruel and vile?

He protects Sansa, who despises Lannisters, and she eventually comes to consider him kind. Tommen and Myrcella both love him, because of the way he treats them. The Tyrells (led by Garlan) have a high respect for him, and can see he's not a monster.

"d1dktn5","Hey friend, first congrats on the new relationship and having an open, vulnerable partner and good for you on wanting to overcome your discomfort in expressing yourself. I am speaking personally with experience in my own relationship with my SO who is six years younger than me (I'm 30). She has never been in a serious relationship/been in love before, and her family/relationship history has not always encouraged her to be forthcoming with her feelings.


First, for a guy to be open/vulnerable means a few things: he wants you to make no mistake about how he feels and wants everything on the table. It's a risky move, but its typically genuine. 


In my experience, I've wanted to be clear, concise, compassionate, but also respectful of my SO's autonomy - I never once wanted her to feel obligated, pressured or uncomfortable. The first time I said that I loved her, I wrote it on a note and left it on her living room table (""Dear SO, I think I love you..."")


She said later that it was the perfect approach for her because she could bask in it and not feel obligated to say it back, which had been her experience previously. (Spoiler: a few weeks later we were saying it for reals.)


For the first few weeks of our relationship (and during the six months of being friends prior) I'd express my genuine affection, appreciation, and the joy I got out of our rapport so that she had all the information about where I stood and where I was coming from. It was also my way of saying ""hey, this is a safe zone, this is how I feel, and I'd love to know your thoughts when you're ready."" 


One of the best examples was one night after some pretty solid making out, I said this: ""If you and I are two trains, running on two tracks, side by side...how far apart are we?"" And she said ""I think you're a little ahead of me, but I'm quickly catching up."" In just a few weeks, we were caught up and on the same page, and it was all the more encouraging for me to express myself, and she said that my ability to communicate inspired her to be a better at it, too. It is still somewhat of a process for her, but I found that each opportunity to express myself was an invitation - but not an expectation - to do the same. 


To your points:

1) You can always qualify your feelings and emotions in a straightforward and nonobligatory fashion. ""Hey, I really, really like you. I enjoy spending time with you. I like that you're so forthcoming. I liked that thing you did when we were together. I understand that this is new and we're still getting to know each other, but here's how I feel about xyz..."" Knowing what excites, thrills or comforts my partner is just encouragement to do it more.


In fact, I would be humored and humbled to read your words ""I'm not sure if this is normal or it makes sense, and I hope it's not ridiculous..."" -- allow him the opportunity to address your fears and eliminate them. If you don't share both your feelings and concerns, he can't know they exist and can't participate in helping make you feel better.


2.) Vulnerability is always a risk, but I'd rather be honest, authentic, and known than a mystery. Likewise, I'd rather know as much about a situation, or a person's feelings, than be in the dark. When you have more information, you can make better choices. I can't imagine a scenario where opening up doesn't invite risk, but that's the name of the game. You wisely make yourself vulnerable to people that earn your trust, respect you and give you comfort. Some will stumble at those gifts, others will excel, but each relationship deserves an opportunity -- especially in the beginning - to create as strong a foundation as possible. 


As a side note, there's nothing wrong with working through things on your own time, in your own heart as long as you're clear about what you're doing. If any partner of you is worth their salt, they'll be happy to hear from you when you're comfortable and confident in your ability to communicate. One of the first big revelations from my SO was that she didn't want to jump into sleepovers (just sleeping) because she wanted to extend the early/getting-to-know-you phase and she felt like she could tell me because she'd always convinced herself to not share her feelings in previous relationships. I cherished that because it told me how serious she was, how interested she was, and that she wanted a relationship that she had some say in. It's important even while being self-aware and pragmatic to also let the relationship be organic. I think it was maybe 2-3 weeks after the ""lets hold off on sleepovers"" and 3AM make out sessions that we just naturally found ourselves waking up to each other every morning. After telling my SO I think I was falling in love with her, it was only a few weeks later where I was past the point of no return. One night I told her I thought she looked like she was in love, and she later admitted she wish she had just told me then that she loved me because it was bursting out of her. Feelings are funny like that.


I left notes, wrote letters, sent tangent-y texts and while she didn't reply in the same quantity, the quality was so much that her letters for Christmas and Valentines brought me to tears. For me, having my SO's voice in my head, being able to read her thoughts, is a real treasure, especially because I can revisit notes and letters, just like your SO can perhaps revisit your feelings as well.


Journaling is a GREAT step, especially because it can be like a thesis statement for your feelings and makes it easier to recall/recite them. A couple's journal is also a great idea to keep a ""secondary"" conversation happening in the relationship and a great opportunity to reinforce and check-in. I would bet that your SO's love language includes words of affirmation and I would bet that he's expressing himself fluidly hoping you'll do the same. Reciprocation is the key to true love. If I were him, and I got a page or two of your thoughts and feelings, I'd swim in them and it would be a good conversation starter.


And a side note: my SO could have saved me months of wondering had she been more forthcoming or made declarative statements about her feelings, but her history hasn't encouraged that. One thing we're working on how is her sharing her feelings in a declarative way without a prompt from me , being more reflective and talking more in the moment. It's important that a healthy relationship be driven more-or-less equally by partners. One of my small qualms (and there are so few it's insane in this relationship) was that I was so thrilled to be her partner, I did a lot of the ""driving"" -- conversations, plans, dates, etc, and she found herself enjoying the ride. Make sure to help steer the relationship by expressing yourself, even if it means being patient and practical until you feel even safer and more comfortable with your SO.

"d15451e","Yeah, Lapis's introduction (especially when you consider that Monster Buddies came a couple of episodes before it) is especially impactful, and it really shook up the sub when it first went down. However, I think the show has definitely seen a turn. I feel like Steven is very forgiving and compassionate, but only when he wants to be, if that makes sense. He forgives people for his mistakes, but...The kid's reasoning in Jail Break is literally, ""They're mean! We have to fight them!""

"d0ynucs","From the personal journal of Astro-chronicler Des Variin.

Humans.  Reviled, worshiped, misunderstood, underestimated.  I first encountered these curious beings some 100 standard years ago, and have yet to fully understand all that makes them so damndibly different from all the other galactic races.

They follow the celestial standard, being bipedal with large brains and being more or less symmetrical, and possessing an organized community.  Humans are curious, nearly to a fault, much like the All'tarr.  They desire to understand the hows and whys of nearly everything they encounter that is different from their normal.  Sometimes this backfires, but usually makes for exceptional leaps in technological advancement far in excess of their time past First Star Exploration (an anthropoligically understood time standard).  They are as advanced technologically, at FSE 125, as other species are at FSE's upwards of 400.  

Humans have, comparatively, short lives but fast reproductive cycles.  This has several effects on their psyche, I theorize.  Their relative fast reproductive rate makes the loss of individuals easier to deal with, so their curious nature that at times gets them into trouble is buffered.

They are, however, aware of their mortality, and so tend to be some of the more pacifistic beings in the galaxy.  Fearing the loss of Human lives, and by extension the lives of others.  They live passionately, love completely, and trust unconditionally.  Usually.  Their short lives means that often times, they live in the moment, but this more often than not means they respect life more than other long lived races that sometimes take their incredibly long lives for granted.  They have been known to broker deals between warring parties and fostering fledgling races when they are found, instead of pacifying them with violence.

Yet, to consider the humans to be pure pacifists, as the Aldarri, would be a heinous mistake.  Their relatively difficult evolution has carefully honed even the most average Human into an organism capable of enduring and inflicting great violence.

For the average Galactic Citizen, when struck in the abdomen with a blaster bolt unprotected, the shock to the neuro system is so severe that death is three to six seconds away.  Humans have been known to survive for as long as eighty minutes, fighting with lethal ability for the first fourteen.  

They are rational and compassionate, but in a stressful situation, a strange evolutionary mechanism manifests, called the fight or flight condition.  Humans possess a gland, that in times of extreme stress, excretes a combat drug.  This drug dulls pain, slows blood loss, and allows for extreme physical performance.  Last year, a settler on Innova-G lifted a 1000 Kg shipping container that had fallen onto her child at their farmstead and rescued the child.

They also have been noted to have an impressive ability to continue to fight after taking damage.  Fighters in their combat sports often continue to mount effective defenses even after taking devastating strikes to their brain cases.  Other fighters have been observed allowing an opponent to dislocate joints rather than forfeit the fight, often continuing to fight until the official stops the match.  There are countless images in the medical files of humans impaled with objects that would have killed 87% of Galactic Council Species.

In Standard Calendar 8327, the Vall discovered the extreme of the Human's fighting capacity when they launched an offensive against 60% of the Human held worlds.  The Humans were only known to the Galactic Councel for 12 Standard years, and thought by all to be pacifists, because of the several successful treaties they brokered in their earliest years.  The Vall wanted the heavy metals known to exist in the Human home solar system's asteroid belt and launched a campaign despite several rounds of negotiations.  Ultimately, this was felt by the humans as a direct attack against the Human Home world, and Humans as a whole.

Today, there is no Vall Home world, and only 20% of the Vall continue to exist.  The Humans have a saying where they ""Make an Example"" of someone.  The Vall is that someone.  The Vall are currently the Human's most fervent allies.  they learned the hard way about the human's darker side.

The Humans are known as the best friend you could have, and the worst enemy.  The Vall have seen both.  I have been blessed to only have been their friend.

&gt; ...instead of talking to him about it...

Here's the point where I'll start to take you to task.  Your difficulties will not change without having a tactful, compassionate, but explicit conversation with him.  You cannot fix things around the sides or in the background and hope for meaningful change because the problem resides with him.  

.  

&gt; The foreplay......runs out of steam...  

You already acknowledge that you guys have difficulty communicating.  This bit is an easy fix.  ""That's good honey....I need you to keep going.""  It's the *I need...* bit that you need to get comfortable with and that goes for this specific issue but also in regards to your sexuality overall.  Yes, it would be nice and particularly attentive if he could tell you wanted more but as the saying goes, you're responsible for your own orgasm.  


&gt; I'm not sure if he even notices that I am not having that good a time.  


Same thing here.  He may get a bruised ego, but that will heal.  Or...you'll discover that he's really not that committed to taking care of you in this way and that leads me to the next bit.   



&gt; I've tried asking for specific things...but it's like he has a road map in his head and just sticks to it.  

And here is where it starts to paint the picture of something a little more difficult to contend with.  You've asked for specific things and he simply doesn't do them....or maybe he just doesn't continue to do them on an ongoing basis.  That's a problem, and it shows that he either doesn't get that those requests remain to be of importance, or he wasn't really comfortable doing them and didn't want to disappoint you in the moment....or he just doesn't care or see the importance.  

See the average invested, interested HL guy should covet those little bits of information like pure gold.  We want to know what you like, what gets you there...what the combination to that particular safe is so we can make sure we make you feel as good as possible....so you'll want to continue having sex with us.  What you should be concerned with here is that you've given him that combination and he wasn't interested enough with what was inside to keep using it and that is absolutely not a reflection on you.  It's his interest and initiative that is lacking and what you need to find out is why?  

If he isn't motivated enough to follow explicit requests then it's very possible that he just isn't that motivated at all...I.e. doesn't desire sex to the degree that you do.  The hard reality is that if you discover that's actually the case it's a perfectly valid thing for him to feel.  Along with that tactful compassionate discussion you need to have, this is really the core of what you have to learn.  How much does he value sex on an ongoing basis in the relationship?  How much does he really require to feel bonded, validated and just plain satisfied?  And where does that line up with your own needs?  


You don't say how long you've been together but if it's less than a year or so you're going to have to seriously consider that this is just who he is...and decide accordingly and make good, connected, mutually satisfying sex a personal boundary for yourself....and make no apologies.

"d0qytfw","Here is where I saw the distinction.  I originally thought I was Vegan when I made the switch from Omni, but as I did reserach quickly realized I was really just doing a plant-based diet.  However, after a few months, I started making non-diet based vegan decisions, and at that point felt comfortable.  People get very wrapped up in the food, which is obviously a giant part of it, because you don't buy shoes 3 times a day every day.

So here is a question, if you had to go buy shoes tomorrow.  Would you go to the shoe store and research whether or not the shoes you wanted to buy were vegan or not.

He said that his daughter had been turned against him and that he had been abandoned and betrayed and treated as “just another chunk of collateral damage.” Now his son has dropped out of school, he wrote, “and I fear that he is indulging in harmful pursuits.”

by evilorigins


TL;DR: My boyfriend won't accept the fact that I've never noticed that he smells bad, and he thinks that me and several of my friends are lying to him about it.


So, my boyfriend, Matt, has some deep-seated trust issues. I understand completely where they come from, and I don't expect him to totally trust me yet when we've been dating such a short time, but, this particular incident is driving me up the wall.


The other day, we were drinking and asking each other questions, and he asks me if there's anything that I've wanted to tell him. I can't figure out what he's talking about, but he keeps pressing the issue.


Matt: 'Just say it. We both know what it is.'
Me: 'I'm not sure that I do. Why don't you say it?'
Matt: 'The ball is in your court.'


I'm still unsure what he's talking about, so he says, 'Here.' and then proceeds to play a series of slow songs, including 'Say Something.' So now, I'm really confused. But anyway, I take the opportunity... ""I love you. Is that what you were waiting me to say?""


He starts laughing, and tells me that he wouldn't have played all those cheesy songs to say that. He does not reciprocate. So now I'm embarrassed, and then for the next hour or so, he continues to push the issue. 'Just say it.''I know you're lying.' 'You're so full of shit.', 'Think about something I brought up months ago.' All the while I'm asking what the hell he's talking about. And he's not believing me.


Eventually I am able to figure it out. He was talking about the fact that he was worried he smelled bad. A few months ago he went to the doctor because he thought he smelled bad after a friend told him that he did.


Now, I have a poor sense of smell. And if it was really bad I would have smelled it. I have told this to Matt before that I never noticed. I told him to ask someone who had a better sense of smell than me. Matt tells me that it's not about that, because he's going to the doctor about it either way, but that it's about me probably lying to him about something so important.


I express how mad I am for how he went about all of that, and how he let me be vulnerable like that, and how frustrated I was that he made me think that he thought I did something terrible or something. So, for the evening, the subject drops.


He brings it up a couple more times. Then last night, we had plans to hang out at his place. I wanted to get some writing done, so I was looking forward to the evening, and I had gone way out of my way to get to his apartment.


When I get there, he informs me that he got off of his phone with friend, and that his friend once again confirmed to him that he has noticed that he has smelled bad before, on a semi-regular basis. Matt tells me to sit down and says that he will ask me one more time. I'm so mad at this point.


Matt says, 'Earlier you said that if there's anything that you can do to put my mind at ease, so what you can do is send a following the facebook message asking mutual friends if you think I smell bad.'


I said, 'How will this make you trust me more?'
He says, 'It just help might make up for it.'
WHATEVER. If this will make the subject drop, I will just ask a few people, as distasteful as I found it to be bullied into something like that. Not to mention, deceiving my friends a little. I'm socially awkward enough. I hate that shit. But I did it, to put his mind at ease.


THE WHOLE TIME that I was trying to send the message (which he constructed) he kept jumping over my shoulder and looking at my texts, making sure I wasn't 'prepping' people. I said I wouldn't do that, and he said that at this point he just wouldn't know.


At this point, I put on my coat. I'm walking out the door. I didn't like being called a liar any more. He apologizes and begs me to stay, saying that he just needs to figure out how many people have noticed, and he's trying to find if it's all the time or just when he's drinking, and that it's really a huge deal because he's looking for a job right now.


So he backs off and I concede and ask a few people, and they all respond to me in the negative. He now thinks that I prepped them or that they are lying because they think he's reading my messages.


I do understand that it is an important topic to him, but I would have no reason to lie to him about that. If I really noticed that he smelled, I would have laughed and brought it up jokingly. In fact I've brought up stuff like that before, like, 'You should brush your teeth,' or something.


Now, it's good he's going to a doctor, but he still won't believe me. I don't need him to trust me on everything right now because of stuff he's been through in the past, but stuff like this? I feel like he should at least know my character well enough. How am I supposed to deal with this without going insane? And what can I do to make him trust me more? Or maybe see the humor in the situation?


And really, he's not usually like this at all. He's usually laid back and funny and compassionate. But his initial reaction to turn his frustrations against me really has put me off. I wanted to be on his side of this situation so I could be there for him, but every time I tried to sympathize with him, he'd say something like, 'See, that's why it's so important that you tell me the truth.' and he kept trying to catch me in a lie.


What am I supposed to do about this? Part of me wants to laugh because it's so absurd, part of me is pissed on how he's behaving towards me over it, and the other is sympathetic of his plight and wants to help.",1455655199,"he's usually laid back and funny and compassionate.","funny and compassionate","compassionate",NA,FALSE,"funny and compassionate","funny",NA,NA,0

That is Superman through and through, but there are approximately 40+ years of his life before that were he wasn't the same man because none of us are the same person today that we will be tomorrow. Every day and every experience changes you and that's what the other heroes did to Supes, and that's what he did to them.

Batman influences him a lot, as does Wonder Woman, and he influences them to a great deal, as well. I'm a little concerned with them making Batman so much older than Superman in this continuity as they are generally pretty close as far as I've been able to tell, but as long as they write the characters intelligently then there will be some great development throughout this movie.
