Hello! I wanted to talk a bit about our first Willow WaxCraft order **as**[ **the whole store**](https://www.etsy.com/shop/WillowWaxCraft?ref=shop_sugg) **is 20% off through the end of the day**. My husband and I ordered three sample packs to find some good scents for our home offices. While some of them weren’t the right vibe for melting during the workday, they were lovely and we’ll be using them in other rooms. The wax melt sample set is a steal and the shots are a very generous size - we use two wax warmers almost every day and we're STILL working through everything. At this point we've tested all of them but one - the throw has been fantastic across the board and the scents are really rich and interesting.

My purchase experience was EXCELLENT:

* Great TAT: Ordered 6/21, shipped 6/25, delivered 6/29. TAT is a little longer right now, at 5-7 business days.
* Everything was beautifully packaged and arrived in perfect condition, along with freebies! Two sample cubes to melt and some green tea + espresso candies that unfortunately I am now addicted to, and am buying by the bucketful on Amazon.

Here are some thoughts on all of them - they’re pretty short because there’s SOOOO many of them, but I hope it serves as a good introduction to the Willow catalog!

***

**Aurora**: *The frigid, invigorating expanse at the top of the world- silent and shimmering with magical Northern Lights. Fresh citrus, rosemary, eucalyptus, peppermint, vanilla, oakmoss, and vetiver.*

* Minty, fresh, and invigorating, but the vanilla is prominent enough that it doesn’t smell like you’re just burning a stick of gum. This is really lovely and one we’ll both be getting a FS clamshell of.

**Bangarang**: *The smell of a hundred fun summers, sleeping in trees and riding the back of the wind. You’ll find your happy thought with this cheerful blend of candied dates, key lime and vanilla whipped cream, zesty lemon curd, tangerine sorbet, crisp water mint and tangy sea breezes. Fly. Fight. Crow.*

* Lemony gourmand goodness! The key lime and lemon curd are very prominent but it’s still very sweet. This is a good scent if you want a room to smell nice but not too rich or heavy. I think it would also be really nice to freshen up a kitchen due to the citrus.

**Bonfire Stories**: *Caramelized marshmallows, a crackling fire, sweet woodsmoke, and all the tales they weave.*

* This is very rich and smoky. Melting it in my small home office was a little overpowering and is not the general vibe I want while working. I need something keeping me feeling upbeat and not making me want to curl up with a mug of cocoa! Super impressive throw though, and we’ll have to try it downstairs, as this would be better for evenings, watching TV, etc.
* Though it wasn’t a good fit for using during the workday, I do really like this one and would recommend it to any bonfire/marshmallow/wood smoke fans.

**Ghoul-Haunted Woodland**: *A dream-like walk through gloomy woods one lonesome October night- propelled by spirits or demons- where? Cool, shadowy conifers, a hint of rain, withering leaves, apples, and lavender.*

* This is the only one we haven’t tried yet, I think because it’s the 4th sample my husband wanted and we’ve loved the other 3 (Make It So, Aurora, Moon Child) so much that we forgot about this one! In the shot cup, it smells like pine and ozone with a bit of lavender in the background. It’s really beautiful and I’m going to go try it out as soon as I hit ‘post’!

**Hygge Cafe**: *All the comforts of a cozy cafe in Autumn. Delicate lavender lattes blended with steamed coconut milk, fresh-baked beignets , pumpkin streusel muffins, and warm mugs of mocha.*

* It KILLS me to say this, but this one leans a little too rich and gourmand for me. The scent notes are really accurate, there’s just a lot going on between the lavender latte/coconut milk/baked goods/mocha. I think this one will end up being a reluctant destash for me - it smells so good and cozy in the shot cup so I haven’t been able to give up on it yet, but when I try to melt it in my office it feels a little overpowering.

**Lost on the Moor**: *The haunting, chilling scent of the wild Yorkshire moor-heather, lavender, moss, chamomile, ozone, juniper and elderflower.*

* This one was a little too cold and damp for me. The moss was pretty prominent. It wasn’t really my style and I destashed it, but the scent notes are very accurate and if you enjoy the notes I think you’d like this one a lot.

**Lady of the Lake**: *Inspired by the protector of Avalon, the mythical Insula Pomona (island of apples). A blend of earl grey and green teas, apple, hyacinth, ozone, datura, and delicate white musk.*

* This one has been my personal favorite for melting in my office. It’s fresh and green, but the apple keeps it sweet, and the musk and ozone keep things interesting. It’s just sooooo pretty and makes me feel like a forest fairy. Please buy it. The end.

**Make it So**: *Tea. Earl Grey. Hot. Just the way the captain likes it, accented with electronic consoles and the cold vastness of space.*

* Genuinely like sipping Earl Grey on the deck of a spaceship. I’m not even sure what else to say about this one….there’s the smell of a lovely cuppa Earl Grey, and then there’s the smell of cold steel. And that is the wax melt and it is FANTASTIC.
* My husband is both an Earl Grey + Star Trek lover so this one was a home run.

**Molten Blue**: *A heady summer elixir-juicy blackberry, earthy-sweet fig, and warm pie crust, all dolloped with melting vanilla bean ice cream.*

* This one took some time to grow on me, but I quite like it now! It’s very sweet and rich but the fig keeps it from being a more standard pie scent. The blackberry is really lovely and the vanilla bean ice cream note is pretty prominent, which I enjoy.

**Moon Child**: *The most vast of empires can arise from a single grain of sand-do what you dream and start wishing. An ethereal blend of rich vanilla, oak, rosewood, vetiver, smooth amber, and musk.*

* A rich, smooth vanilla with a smoky twist. My husband has been melting this one in his office but I think it would also be really nice literally anywhere else in your home. If you’re a vanilla lover you definitely need to try this one!! Or, if you want to grab some wax as a gift, I think this would be a relatively safe bet.

**Primeval Forest**: *The ancient wilderness, full of memory. Cardamom, cedarwood, loam, rose, and decaying foliage scattered on the forest floor.*

* I think I’ve tried melting this one or twice now and liked it, but didn’t *loooove* it. The cardamom and cedar are most prominent to my nose but there’s also a good bit of wet earthiness to it and I think that’s where it loses me (which is perfectly fair, the notes advertise loam + decaying foliage lol). If the notes make it sound like it’s up your alley, it probably is!

**Unmask!**: *A polished roque mallet, aged wood and vanilla, hearth embers, pine, evergreen topiary animals, rich merlot, and sparkling champagne. Great Party, isn’t it?!*

* Decadent, luxurious, mysterious. I think I was having trouble finding a 12th sample and picked this one just to see what it smelled like. It’s very true to the scent notes! But given the opulent, lush notes, this means it was a little much for either of us and we destashed it.

***

**Free samples:**

**Primaveral**: Those precious and rare late winter days that \*almost\* feel like spring. Wild honey, morning glory, and sweet cherry blossom, with cool garden greens and zesty dill weed.

* Mr. Everything said it smelled like fancy shampoo. It didn’t particularly grab me (I believe it was the honey, morning glory, and dill weed that aren’t really my style) so we destashed it.

**Thornfield Hall**: A stately, elegant blend of rosewood and musk, paired with pale pumpkin and wild lilac. This bird can’t be caged.

* This one was nice but neither of us really loved it as much as some of the others (I think it was the lilac), so we destashed it.

***

TL;DR: Out of these 12 samples we got full size clamshells of Aurora, Lady of the Lake, Make It So, and Moon Child. For our next sample order I want to try Evelyn June and Liber Arcana, but I’m waiting until the Falloween scents are released. :) I’d really recommend checking out Willow Waxcraft, especially today while they still have the 20% off sale!!",1598819295,"at this point we've tested all of them but one - the throw has been fantastic across the board and the scents are really rich and interesting.","rich and interesting","rich",NA,FALSE,"really rich and interesting","interesting","really",NA,1

"g3b2pb2","The worst part part about the stupid recall was how shortsighted it was.

It removed a judge who followed what was both his standard procedure and a widely accepted practice, and was going to be criticized no matter what he did. We saw what happened when he accepted the probation department’s recommendation, but if he rejected it and imposed a harsher sentence for the first time in his career he would have been criticized for not judging the case fairly and letting outside forces and popular opinion sway his ruling. That criticism would have been justified.

The judge was in a no-win situation.

The shortsighted part is the effect is has on other elected judges. Rather than using their discretion and giving lenient sentiences where they feel appropriate, or following probation departments’ recommendations that are relatively lenient, the judges may feel the need to give more [jail time and overall harsher sentences](https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2018/06/07/the-cost-of-a-judicial-recall/). They don’t want “to be seen as going easy on any defendant,” which could result in having careers ruined in the same way as Turner’s judge, so  the easiest way to avoid that is to give long sentences. 

That’s not a good outcome for anyone, except for probably private prison owners and operators.

A criticism of the Turner sentence is he got off easy because he is white and rich, but the long term effects of the recall will probably hurt non-white and poor defendants the most.

Other than campagin advisors who made money on both sides, defense lawyers who will represent future defendants of these longer sentences, and the private prison industry, I can’t think of anyone who benefited from this recall.",1598750181,"a criticism of the turner sentence is he got off easy because he is white and rich, but the long term effects of the recall will probably hurt non-white and poor defendants the most.","white and rich","rich",NA,FALSE,"white and rich","white",NA,NA,0
"g3b1eh6","Hey man, I’m right there with you, starting a startup and I have have been failing on balancing work and relationships. On top of it I’m so far away from my friends in a different country in a city that’s still under lockdown.

I’ve thought about it a lot and the truth is you have to prioritize your friendships. Relationships are extremely important, otherwise you could turn out super successful but alone( and that’s the best case scenario). When you really think about it, what’s the point of reaching all your goals if you have no one to celebrate with you? Who do you call on for support if you’ve isolated yourself from anyone? Sure they are your friends but the greater the gap become, the less available and interested they will be to you. As the saying goes “Out of sight, out of mind”.

So I would strongly encourage you to pick a time frame twice a week (mornings/ afternoons/ evenings)  and spend it with friends.  Focus purely on them and nothing else. Because the truth is there will always be more work to do. Something is always going to come up or need to be fix or be improve or whatever. The cycle will never end. It’s something you just have to accept and be okay with. Cause success isn’t a race, you will get there. 

Take your time and enjoy these moments you have because eventually you won’t have the time to. People get old, they move, they die, they will at some point not be a part of your life for one reason or another. So you should cherish them while you can. Just because you “might” be free in the future doesn’t mean they will. It doesn’t mean they will be there. 

The narrative has become go all out to reach your goals and become successful and rich but how many of those ppl are actually even happy? How many of them have their childhood friends around? How many even have any real friends?

This has been my realization cause I’m not at all living the life that I want. And it’s because I’ve been so obsessed with “making it” that I’ve push away almost everyone from life. And it doesn’t feel good.

A lone wolf will eventually die if he doesn’t make it back to the pack.

"g3abd6r","Thanks for the award! I’m stoked!  

What you have described is very much similar to my understanding of the culture in West Virginia. My grandparents (Dad’s side) moves from the Wetzel County, WV in the 70s to Ohio when a bunch of grandpa’s family did the move to work steel plant in Massillon, Oh. Before that grandpa had worked the coal mines for a very short time. He had died young of ‘coal miners lung’/ ‘black lung’ which was basically emphysema.  

I actually learned a lot about the history of WV from reddit after I tried googling something I vaguely remembered my grandmother saying when I was a child. In the 90s there would still be 1-800 number commercials to call to join lawsuits against companies that exposed workers to the coal and caused their health to fail. I believe this is a ‘very american’ thing but they had 1-800 commercials to call for a variety of things you could sue for if a product, advertisement, or accident had happened to you. In reality no one was actually getting rich by calling these numbers, it was more a way for lawyers to look for very specific clients to make really strong cases. Like fishing for clients that had a 1 in a million scenario that was probable in a courtroom.  

Anyhow I vaguely recalled my grandma mentioning that grandpa “was always healthy before he worked the mine” which is obviously believable. But it was insinuated that workers at certain mines had gotten sicker and this was some wrong doing on part of the mine operators. I couldn’t recall further than that. I kind thought that it was suggested that they either new the specific areas they were digging was more harmful or that some new chemical had been used that caused this.  

As an adult nurse I understand that coal mining would have been devastating to anyone’s lung health regardless of the circumstances. But out of curiosity I thought I would google it. I expected to find some reasonable explanation of why people felt certain mines where more deadly and why those rumors existed. I theorized that it could have been as simple as often men from one family would all work at the same mine, meaning that if several died comparatively young it could be attributed to something genetic. Or maybe different equipment/procedure actually did make certain mines more harmful. I never did find the answer but during the process I stumbled across a reddit comment that really brought a lot of things I knew together as a clear picture. (I’ll try to find and link the comment).  

West Virginia does have the mentality of “the hills”(that’s how they refer to it)  very much being the only place to live and die. I can recall people who worked in Ohio and weren’t rich but able to retire with pensions moving back to “the hills”. Atleast one guy I know lived so far back in the woods it required a 4 wheel drive to get to his property in anything less than perfect weather. The indoor plumbing wasn’t heated. And this guy had plenty of $$$ but “everyone returns to the hills”.  

West Virginia wasn’t on the side of the confederacy during the civil war and isn’t really in the lower half of the United States either. But many people there believe they are “southern”. Not in the way the south is described in current media or with a focus on race relations or the past civil war. More along the lines of “southern hospitality”. They’re very much a group of people that offer anyone who visits food. Family focused. Religious. Blue collar. Overall friendly people.  

There isn’t a focus on new fashion or even new cultural music or experiences. It’s a simple life. Some people view these people as stupid, beneath them, or less capable but that hasn’t been my experience. I do know that southern Ohio and West Virginia has a huge opiate abuse and meth problem tho and that’s really fed into the stereotype for the last several years/decade.",1598736765,"i can recall people who worked in ohio and weren’t rich but able to retire with pensions moving back to “the hills”.","rich but able","rich","but",FALSE,"rich but able","able",NA,NA,1

"g3919c8","Desolation Road by Ian McDonald - the history of a small, strange town on a planet that is slowly being colonised, from its founding to its eventual end. Written in the style of Magical Realism, like One Hundred Years of Solitude, but lots of fun.


Gateway by Fred Pohl - an incredibly rich but troubled man in a dystopian future tells his psychiatrist the story of his journey from rags to riches, by using the tiny, barely-understood, alien starships found in an asteroid orbiting close to the sun to salvage tech from the ruins of the aliens' civilisation with teams of other would-be prospectors, which is incredibly dangerous. There's an incredible sense of building dread through the course of this book and an incredible pay-off. There are sequels, but I found the book is too perfect as it is to want to read any more (and anyway, it apparently turns into the kind of story you're sick of from book 2 onwards and isn't as good, as far as I've picked up)


Schismatrix Plus by Bruce Sterling - A young activist is exiled from his home after his performative suicide attempt is foiled, and cons and hustles his way around the solar system, presently caught in a cold war between two technopolitical ideologies - the Shaper Ring Council, a ""military-academic complex"" focused on biotechnology and behavioural conditioning, and the powerful Mechanist Cartels, which prioritise life extension via cybernetics. Neuromancer gets all the fame as *the* cyberpunk novel, but Schismatrix is the *other* big cyberpunk novel. Also probably invented the New Space Opera, despite the fact that the stakes never get stupendously high.

"g38hmml","So far, not bad!

I think there’s an overarching structure problem that results from this piece being stylistically, clearly a waltz - but for some reason being spelled in compound meter resulting in some trouble at mms. 15 &amp; 19. In fact, the languid lyrical quality of the melody in some places tends to run up against the rigidity of the 12/8,  I think changing the whole thing to 3/4 and calling a waltz a waltz might free you up to stretch out and do some structural polishing as well.

That said, since it is a waltz, you have stylistic conventions to keep. The III7-I in measure 10 for me felt rather abrupt, and so did the rushed resolutions in measures 2, 17 &amp; 32. Also worth revisiting is the sort of stark voice leading in the left hand in measure 29, the modulation in msr 34, which could benefit from some form of preparation, a pretty hard dissonance in the 2nd beat of msr 35 (Between Do Reb and Mib on the 2nd division of the triplet), and the exposed left hand in msr 38, which keeps the phrase length even at the expense of momentum. 

Technically, some of the octave passages you wrote are quite difficult, especially things like that very fast Sib-Do in m.17, I’m not saying to change it per se, but it’d be good to experiment with other ways to flesh out the texture. Apart from that the left hand is often quite repetitive, it doesn’t contribute much until the voice-switch. This is partly because it’s a waltz form, but it might be nice to try to voice the accompaniment with some more structural significance (check out the Rosenkavalier waltzes, they’re such a trip to hear mostly because of the way Strauss gives us a very rich, but totally integrated texture). Also on the technical side, I’d struggle to count anything like what you wrote in msr 43. A switch to 2/2 with triplets in the right hand might be easier to read, or it might be more artistically gratifying if you stay in triple meter and revoice the arpeggiating pattern.

Also - as others have pointed out, it’ll be nice to have a completed ending!

"g2m5hft","Just gonna repost what I wrote some time back here, that is my life story in a nut shell, lol.

 

I was having a problematic life myself. I got successful and that was nice, not rich like super rich, but new cars, a nice house etc. not cheap ones either and I have a lovely SO too.

However, throughout all of it I just could not bring myself to be happy. I was miserable every single day, dreading every moment, I was feasting on shit like benzos, kratom, weed, alcohol etc. just to numb myself. No matter any success, I felt like I did not deserve it, never got any satisfaction. Once I got something, I was like: ""Well, nice. What now?"" and I was left questioning if this is all that life is offering or what the hell is wrong with me. I kept obsessively cleaning up after myself everywhere, so as to not leave a trail with anything, afraid that things will come back to me, I felt guilty for no reason. I was helping people out but I only later found out it was because I wanted help myself and would not allow it. Never show emotions, I was told.

So I started digging. I got sick of myself trying to tell people what to do since people for some reason (which I only learned later as to why) kept coming to me asking for advice, what to do in their life and so on. I felt like I was a fraud, for I had nothing figured out myself. I started digging into Jung, but I found it too far out, to be honest. I was not even sure who I was, had no clue, it was too early for me. On a side note I do believe that this is a problem for a lot of people, getting into Jung too early when they have not properly matured, developed yet. I feel like it can really spiral you downwards if you are not careful (iirc Jung himself said this too, that during earlier stages of life other theories are more worth pursuing).

After nearly hitting rock bottom, I had a few sittings at a clinical psychologist, had some diagnoses etc. that I will not get into. But it did help me, because I was finally thinking of myself instead of others or some success outside of me. I finally was getting some help that I externalized always by trying to give it to others. It was not the diagnosis or some such, or the attention, just the fact I was actually doing something for myself. Unrelated to that or rather synchronistically related, I have found the theories and works of people like Laurence Heller, Besser van der Kolk, David Bercelli, Steven Porgres. It helped me to realize what was wrong, what were the reasons for my tension, anxiety, emptiness etc. and I could finally pinpoint where it started from, ranging from my very early childhood and could start from there. Since I experienced some very traumatic and stressful things during my first years especially, my whole body, brain, nerve system were in constant state of danger and I was fighting for my life, without even knowing why or the fact that I am. Once I figured that out, it was immense relief for me, getting to the root of the problem. I am still far from done now, but I am doing much better. No longer need any medication, I do not drink, I do not do drugs.",1598210600,"i got successful and that was nice, not rich like super rich, but new cars, a nice house etc. not cheap ones either and i have a lovely so too.","rich, but new","rich","but",TRUE,"rich , but new","new",NA,NA,1

"g18c5cr","I don't get it, you're associating fleeing from countries with fleeing from slavery, and equating that to people leaving communist countries. That's your gotcha against communism? It's not logically sound, but okay let's examine that. 

All countries are not equally developed. The countries that adopted communism were poor to begin with. They made big leaps in economic development, but they're still poor relative to the developed countries, regardless of what economic system they have. That's why people leave. What you're ignoring is the constant stream of people fleeing dirt-poor capitalist countries from the Philippines or Mexico to places like the US. 

Why would people flee poor capitalist countries, and why isn't capitalism working for them there? Because places like the US are the imperialist core. They're where all the pillaged resources of the world are funneled to. Who makes your clothes? Americans? No, underpaid Asian laborers in poor capitalist countries. Who makes your electronics? The minerals are mined by underpaid African laborers and then assembled by underpaid Asian laborers. Capitalism is a caste system with haves and have nots. The people that make your consumer goods are have nots, and they want to flee and be part of the haves. 

There's also something to learn from your example of slaves fleeing the South to get to the North. Because it's deceptive, the North seems free on its surface, but the North was not against slavery. Northern businesses financed slavery, they were deeply connected to it. The North was rich because it profited from it.

"fzzjwtz","With most of these ""cults"" or groups and most members don't actually believe in them. In the UK there is one called ""The Brethren"" and I think is linked to something in the US called ""Blue Diamond"". It's basically just a club to get rich (sort of like the Masons). 

The Brethren is almost exclusively made up of very rich very successful businessmen who all give each other backhanders and whatnot. Basically it makes it completely impossible to compete with said businesses because they offer almost non-profit prices to other Brethren members (though of course they make their profit through the Brethren- no tax yay!)

Scientology strikes me as being very similar. If you want to be a powerful/successful/super rich actor then you join up and benefit from the links that you gain to other members in the industry. You are a scientologist actor- a scientologist producer/director will favour you over non-scientologist candidates. Of course it's not just join up and get rich, but if you are already rich and influential then it is a very easy way to almost double that richness without really having to lift a finger. 

Do these celebrities believe in some weird alien religion? Nope, but they know if they humour those who run Scientology and contribute themselves then they will get a very cushy life out of it. 

Then of course you have the poor saps who aren't rich or powerful. They either join because they are promised riches or they genuinely believe in this religion. These are the ones that get abused whilst everyone else is hanging out in luxury jerking each other off.

To start, he conveniently uses Amazon’s gross profit to indicate their financial health and that a tax is a rounding error. And why wouldn’t he - a $120B “gross profit” just sounds nice and rich. But the more accurate number to use to indicate how much “profit” a company made in a year is *net income.* Amazon’s 2019 net income was $11.6B - less than a tenth of what Nick is reporting. [Read for yourself the differences between gross profit and net income here, but here’s the main takeaway. ](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/101314/what-are-differences-between-gross-profit-and-net-income.asp) For one of the largest (by market cap) companies in the world, an $11B profit is very small.

One solution is to internationally prevent tax havens and limit how low can you make the taxes go. Easier said than done, you first need some international body. Ireland gets some hate in the EU for having such low taxes, and it is a topic of discussion, for example. In an ideal world, some sort of global treaty would limit how low can the taxes go. In the real world, however, the Nordic model is a decent solution: high taxes for the medium rich, but low taxes for the extremely rich.

"fqqtlm3","Your post is heavily disingeneous.

1. Healthcare premiums: That graph clearly shows vast majority of the ""extra"" tax is in the form of employer premiums, not employee premiums, yet pre tax income in the US is like 50% more in median than most western european nations. So it doesn't matter if those ""employer"" premiums matter, I'm talking about pre tax gross income. Only the employee premiums matter, if you account for those, the post tax income of Americans is still much higher than Europeans.
2. Wealth taxes: You're essentially saying fringe economists argue that wealth taxes are good, because the economists who ""specialize"" in wealth taxes are the same ones who adopt a heterodox view refuted by most economists.

Here are the views of European economists who are more left leaning than AMerican economists on this same thing:[https://www.ifo.de/DocDL/dice-report-2018-2-fuest-neumeier-stimmelmayr-stoehlker.pdf](https://www.ifo.de/DocDL/dice-report-2018-2-fuest-neumeier-stimmelmayr-stoehlker.pdf)Go to page 4.

Wealth taxes would suppress GDP by -5% for every year implemented if implemented the way Bernard Sanders Mr. wants. It would reduce household savings by 40% and ensure in eternity that all wealth is only held by the rich, now you might ask, why is that? the contradictory nature of this is, as wealth taxes increase businesses lose the incentive to invest, instead they will spend all their money on depreciating assets for immediate conenience. If you told me tommorrow you will take away 50% my bank account over 32 million i will purposefully spend all of that money in buying a private jet or yacht.  


OVERALL WEALTH TAXES WOULD REDUCE REVENUE BY -25% ON THE LONG RUN!!

That is why they were completely rejected byt he SPD-CDU coalition here. It's the perfect way to crash any developed economy and mire the people in poverty.

It sounds great if you're envious of the rich, but horrible if you are a pragmatic person who cares about the well being of society rather than punishing the rich for being successful.

I hope you actually learn from this instead of purposefully posting ideological drivel.

3) Payroll taxes in the US are at a flat rate of 7% on your post tax income for most people, in Germany they are like 20%, so I don't understand this, an median American household will be earning 60k according to your same graph will pay 5k in healthpremiums in post tax income and 7% payroll tax and post CTC will pay 0% federal income tax

In Germany the same household will not only earn less money pre tax (adjusted for percentile)) but will pay more as percent in full taxes + health insurance. The German family will literally end up worse off.

If you go really poor the US family qualifies for medicaid while the German family still has to pay for healthcare via the 7.3% statutory rate.

Not only this, every purchase of non food items in germany is taxed at 20% VAT, in the US the highest state tax is like 10% and most states have lower sales tax.",1589571725,"it sounds great if you're envious of the rich, but horrible if you are a pragmatic person who cares about the well being of society rather than punishing the rich for being successful.","rich, but horrible","rich","but",TRUE,"rich , but horrible","horrible",NA,NA,1

"fowxku4","This is indeed a nice thought provoking situation. I will give it an attempt

Minimum pre-requisites
1. Chinese economy in itself is the biggest in the work. In fact it is twice-thrice the second economy
2. China has progressed further ahead as a country both in culture and technology
3. They are now manufacturing better phones than electronics than Apple etc
4. They have the best space station and satellites orbiting earth (bigger than ISS), the best super computers, the most advanced AI and AI applications, and the most invasive surveillance 
5. They manufacture ALL their weapons. Every single one (just like the US does right now)
6. Their weapons are in fact the best that money can buy. Think F-35 and F-22 fighters and super carriers for the US. Right now the Chinese equivalents are generations behind.

I believe they will definitely be a massively authoritarian state in this scenario with an all powerful central(federal) govt and relatively independent provinces doing their own thing but subservient to central govt mandate. All large scale violence and force is monopolized by the center. Inside china it might as well look like a black mirror episode.
Reason for this is that if they reach such a state, the ruling party has even more claim to authoritarian power as they have toppled the world super power and pushed it back at a minimum to its home land (Hawaii will be the limit of American military bases in this case)


So… given that all of the above does happen. What would Pax-sinicia look like
Lets see.

1. No need to dismantle India, jus to stay a 100 years ahead of India as a country. Indian military in this scenario will never have the capability to blockade Chinese shipping on its own for any sustainable period of time. They might blockade for a week or so before being utterly defeated. India is a very pragmatic country in any case. They will definitely tilt towards appeasing Chinese interests in this scenario anyways. The Chinese have the biggest market in the world in any case and who doesn’t wanna sell goods into this Chinese market! (Think how bad it is to loose the American market for any business)

2. Pakistan will be a firm ally in a NATO style pact. Chinese mega PLA bases on the afghansitan border and mega ports on the Arabian Sea to ensure access to the Middle East and Europe. India has no hope to win a fight with Pakistan in this scenario. India will probably try to align itself with an American alliance but it might not even be available. India will have to hold the border on the Himalayan range by itself. 

3. All of South East Asia has to fall in line and eject American military bases at a minimum. 
Philippines, Vietnam, Thailand, South Korea (united Korea?) , Indonesia. All of them.

4. Japan and Australia might be the only ones still hosting American bases but that too in limited capacities. Being almost inconsequential in terms of strategic significance. Not enough equipment and isolated. The next nearest friendly ports will be in India and Hawai. 
Australia will have to make the difficult choice between “staying independent but poor(alliance with america)” and “get rich but loose foreign policy autonomy to china (alliance with china)”  

5. One could argue, that Japan would be swayed to move into the Chinese sphere eventually and eject American military. But this doesn’t seem likely to happen without a short war at a minimum (maybe a civil war spurned by agitation from china). Japan would be the last domino to fall in any case.

6. If either of Japan or Australia make the strategic shift to align with China, the other will follow suit as its left with no other option. Refusal to do so would result in economic sanctions from china and possibly a naval blockade too. Even without a blockade , how can u survive sanctions for a 100 years. U’ll become Cuba

7. Malaysia and Thailand  would have to guarantee safe passage through the straight of Malacca by treaty. It broken, it means war. Similar to the Suez canal. In return they get access to the Chinese market and Chinese investment money. Chinese defense budget would have to be the biggest in the world. South china see must be full of patrolling carrier groups to keep the island chain countries in line and enforcing freedom of navigation for Chinese navy vessels to keep the straight open. The icing on the cake would be if one of Thailand or Burma is convinced to allow a naval base or docking privileges in a port facing the Andaman sea. Such concessions from Malaysia itself are far fetched and will never happen. Malaysia knows the value of the strait it controls. 

8. I am not sure if its possible, but if a Panama style canal project can be done in Thailand to open a second route towards the Andaman sea, that would be beneficial to both china and Thailand and definitely help in making Malaysia fall in line. Even a threat to make this canal will force Malaysia to back off and align with china properly. There is too much money to be made here.

7. India does not need to be dismantled, just contained. The Himalayas are a great natural barrier between the two entities. The Chinese would fortify this barrier from one end to the other. Most heavily on the Pakistani side by giving material to Pakistan.This would prevent any adventures to over-run tibet by India. India would however secure Sri Lankan allegiance by hook or crook. Sri Lanka will not be allowed to host Chinese Navy.

8. Bangladesh would make sure not to fall into Chinese occupation by aligning tightly with India, and India itself would have to be very relaxed in its obvious confrontation with Chinese interests. Bangladesh is not much use to china anyways.

Having secured the southern and Eastern flanks, the Northern and wester borders are more fluid
9. Up north, Mongolia and Kazakhstan remain as nice buffers with Russia.
10. Russia itself will benefit from a powerful china and it will becomes China’s gas station. Russian and Chinese interests will align all over the globe.They will divide Central Asia in zones of control
11. To the west, Iran would be pulled firmly into a NATO style defense pact with China. Iran would benefit greatly from this Pax-china. It would rapidly become the most dominant nation in the Middle East by far. Iran would supply china with fuel and also get a huge market for Persian culture exports. Chinese tourists would visit all over Iran. By all means, Iran’s western borders would be considered sacrosanct for the Pax-china. Invading Iran and attacking it means war with china at this point. (Just like invading Saudi Arabia means war with USA effectively right now). With Iran’s govt aligned, China gets influence with all of Iran’s allies (half of Iraq, and syria). But we won’t see Chinese military bases all over the Middle East. China will rely on Iran to keep the rest of the Middle East in line. It could be argued that Iran is in fact the best and most developed nation in the Middle East anyways at this point. Even right now, on its own Iran is far stronger than all other Middle East nations combined(without US assistance).
12. North Africa and Israel will still be aligned with watever is left of the former western power blocks. Europe will have a say for sure. Western Europe will be far more united than ever too. The threat to the east is too great to ignore now.

All of this is possible only if the pre-requisites stay true. This itself is a herculean task. They will be able to maintain that dominance for a certain period of time only. The rest of the world will catch up. And one by one, these alliances will start loosing strength. 
Even in case of a general retreat , at a minimum a new line in the South China Sea would be drawn. Western navies encroaching these lines would mean war. The freedom of navigation principles will be removed for military vessels. The Chinese nation won’t allow foreign military to loiter near its coastline (similar to how Russian navy in Cuba is unthinkable).

The role of India in this PAX-China would be very interesting. Whatever reality they have to accept, internally they will strive for independent foreign policy and attempt at breaking out of encirlement. 
This means heavily militarized Arabian Sea  and Bay of Bengal naval ports even if with inferior weapons. U won’t be able to convince India to not roam around the Indian Ocean with any naval vessel it deems necessary. In cases of conflict with china, it will be a delicate balance. India’s The norther border favors china. They can bring in vast resources to keep India contained. They can even attempt land invasions and bog down the entire indian economy in defending the northern borders.
India on the other hand will always have the option of disrupting Chinese shipping in the Indian Ocean. Hit and run tactics.Diego Garcia will remain a western naval base. We will eventually see joint Indian and Chinese navy anti-piracy operations near Somalia. India will in essence , barely hang on playing all its cards. Biding its time. For India to meaningfully push back, it will have to get to a state where its economy is at least half of the Chinese economy.

In the American continents, Monroe doctrine will still hold true. Pushing that back without nuclear Armageddon is not possible. Hawai would become the most militarized naval base in the world outside the Chinese sphere.

Western Europe would align ever more tightly as the Bear(Russia) on the East grows in strength. This would be against British interests as usual but it would make sense as this time the threat to Britain is once again to the east of Germany and not a united continent. The Atlantic Ocean will be the domain of whatever remains of Pax America.

"foam724","I do have a bit of a background in economics. 

The line going down means the perfect opportunities are opening up, all around us, to work within our own sphere with the tools we have to radicalize the people we come in contact with. I've had gentle conversations with people who are truly freaked out this whole week. I've put books in some of their hands (virtually, of course). I am fortunate enough to still have a job right now, but I also volunteer at a neighborhood food distribution center 3 days a week, and help give out school lunches, and those suburban housewives coming in for the first time are ripe for radicalization. They are freaked. The fuck. Out.

No, they're not rich, but many of them at one point were doing pretty well, enough so that they didn't have to work and their hubbies brought home the bread. They've seen a downhill slide for ten years, since the last downturn, during which time they were raising kids who are now hungry teenagers who can't go to school and see their friends. They thought things were getting better before 2016. Now they see it was all bullshit. AMD they're looking for answers.

When the line goes down, it really freaks out the rich. Much of their worth is on paper, so the line going down means they are less rich. It means their hold on the system is slipping, so they make rash decisions. They sometimes lose everything. 

And that's good. It means some of them join the ranks of people who have always had less.

This worldwide shift has caused a LOT of people to lose their tiny little minds. They are having to struggle like many have done most of their lives, and they don't know how.

It's the perfect time to talk about anarchy to people experiencing this fear and disruption for the first time. It's the perfect time to show them where in their community, anarchy is people helping people. It's doing the right thing, even when no one is watching. It's literally all those sayings you learned as a child about everyone is valuable, everyone is equal.

The rich depend on complacency. When people aren't complacent, things stop working for them. That's the real opportunity here.

Incremental change is the only thing that lasts, except when regimes topple. The regime of capitalism is gasping its dying breath, y'all. It's like the Balrog, it is huge and it is angry and it is burning everything down in its grasp, and it is going to take some with it, but the rest will remain and what appears to be lost will be transformed. You may not recognize it at first. It will be that different. 

Suburban housewives apparently tipped the edge toward Drumpf winning the WH last time. They won't be voting stupidly this time around. They've seen the monster. Let's help them topple it over the edge. Let's not lose this chance to work change in our communities. One brain, one life, one hand, at a time.

Be vigilant. Be aware. Be present. Be kind to those who are ready for change. Ignore those who aren't. Don't let assholes and the unevolved have the last word. 

We have nature, amd the natural order of things, on our side. The Earth itself is reacting to the cancer of capitalism. This was foreseen by economists decades ago. No one wanted to hear it then, but there were plenty who foresaw this.

"fl31yko","**CONCLUSION:**

*Entering my new 1000th life (which was set up by my life administrator to take revenge on me), I'll be reborn into being a female of the beautiful elven race named* ***Dremmuc*** *on a world called Eoyila. Growing up in the strict and uptight elven society, my promiscuous nature would spark numerous conflict with my people and family (who demand a holy, stoic and elite lifestyle), which eventually would force me to depart from my birthplace and venture out on my own to find a new home.*

*Traveling the wild expanse wouldn't be easy, but my fated talents and elven hereditary would make me a prodigious survivalist and animal speaker perfectly fit for the challenge. I would find my way to a human society and settle down to explore my innately active sexuality. Though I'm not gifted in any way that can help me make a good living, I'd scrape by days after days using my body in exchange for favors and shelter.*

*Time would pass on until I manage to gather together enough to purchase a residence to call my own: an old, run down cabin in the woods once inhabited by an old witch. Once I've made myself acquainted with the place, the spirit wolf guarding the house would bind its soul to mine, forever make me immortal. The magic would lock my apparent form into that of an alluring matured elven MILF who's in her 400 for all eternity, as if to take forever take over the role of the previous owner as a motherly cougar witch who is well loved by the local.*

*As time fly by again, I would discover more hidden talents in myself. My many sexual fetishes has incredible power capable of enforcing changes upon other as I wish, a power made even more rare consider those that have the same power fetish only possess at most one of them. Factoring in a unique set of lust related spells that I am the lone possessor of, and you would get an enigmatic lusty MILF-y witch capable of bending others to her will through sexual magic.*

*No later would I fatefully come in contact with a rich and powerful nobleman of the kingdom who wishes to buy himself my service, which to his credit strikes right at my desire to earn material wealth. I'd soon become his escort, my own power altering my body into a bimbo-terrific proportion befitting my Sugar Daddy's desire. Using the endless money he gave me I'd live a lavish life, rebuilding my run-down witch cabin into a private forest-side majestic mystical mansion and upgrading my lifestyle into a luxurious one. For my part, I'd just have to be Daddy's personal bimbo MILF who would sexually pleases him at his beck and call. My uncanny talent for the art of sex would lead me to be the best fucker in all the realm, satisfying Daddy to no end for having such a terrific fuck-buddy.*

*With all the profit Daddy would give me, I would finally go out to find nice men to settle down (staying with Daddy is fun of course, but my maternal instinct urges me to have kids of my own). Using my bimbotastic charm and the magic to drive any person into primal lust as well as slowly dumbing them down with my bimbofication power, I was able to hog many rich but not so bright merchants all to myself. Wrapping their around my finger, I soon became their wife and mistress.*

*As more time passes, I'd come to be known as one of the most influential woman in the city. Sure, I may look like and have the infamy of being a ditzy, slutty chihuahua bimbo who regularly cheat on her numerous rich husbands and occasionally being a public sex offender who masturbate wildly out in the open. But then people also would know well that I'm friend with those sitting in the higher echelon, and my many families possess uncountable wealth and connection. And most would do their best not to provoke my anger, cause they know better not to be victims for my bimbofication fetish (where I can reduce any sane person into vapid brainless bimbo and himbo who looks like me - well, technically I look like the bestest bimbo there can ever be), or to mess with my companion spirit wolf, or to incur the wrath of my noble sugar daddy, or even getting on the bad side of my numerous children that I sire (I may be a cheating bimbo, but I am a terrific MILF and the best mother for her children who loves them all very much).* 

*Oh and speaking of children, one of my favorite daughter is another pure-blood elf named Meriel (her father is a rich merchant elf man whom I seduced and made into a dull himbo husk). She would be an up and coming magician with talents in the right places (unlike mine) with a kind heart and an even kinder smile, and she's one of my not-so-secret incestuous lovers (yes, I fuck with my own children) and trusted guardian.*

*The city would come to know me as their ""Bimbo Witch Queen"" who could seduce and make men fall or rise on a whim, and I would love to hear their gossiping behind my back, either insult and humiliate me for my bimbo behavior, or praising and be in awe of my great power and position.*

*So all in all, my life administrator to take revenge on me kinda work to some extent, but never as punishing as they would have wanted. Sure I'm gonna be infamous for being a massive bimbo and most wouldn't take me seriously for that, but I've also made choices that would land me into relationship with high power and can end up garnering powerful influence myself. If this is what I have to endure on my 1000th life, I'd say I'm already digging it. Now, let's not keep my bimbo-licious life waiting any longer.*

"fhafbjx","It's quite a long document so I'll post a few exerpts. A few parts of this study caught my eye:

On Labour's Values:

&gt; A majority of Labour members, including nearly two thirds of 2016 Corbyn leadership voters, said they thought Labour’s values and general outlook on life were closer to those of the British public than the Conservatives’.Voters themselves were more likely to think the Conservatives’ values were closer (36%) than Labour’s (20%), though 44% said neither party’s was closer, or that they didn’t know.

&gt; More than half of those who switched from Labour to the Conservatives said they thought the Tories’ values were closer to those of the British public, with only one in 20 thinking this was truer of Labour. Labour defectors to the Lib Dems, however, were more than three times as likely to think Labour values were closer to those of the public at large than to think this was true of the Conservatives.

Focus groups on Labour's values:

&gt; Partly because of this, some also felt the party had come toembody an excessively politically correct or “woke” culture, which would be intolerant of what they considered sensible, mainstream views: “Sarah Champion in Rotherham was booted out for saying the vast majority of child abuse groups were from ethnic minorities. She was speaking the truth, but because it was ‘racially insensitive’ it was, ‘oh, you can’t say that’. Why? It’s 100% true;” “They’re classing themselves as liberals but won’t let anyone else have a different viewpoint;” “You’re a bigot if you don’t agree there are 125 different genders;” “They can be woke, but they can also be vitriolic. I’ve heard them say things to Conservatives where I thought, ‘well, that wasn’t very nice’;” “The other day Jeremy Corbyn even did his pronouns! He said, ‘my name’s Jeremy Corbyn and my pronouns are ‘him’ and ‘his.’ You can Google it!”

&gt; At the same time, Labour seemed to have become disconnected from the kinds of people –like our participants –whom they used to represent: “They knew us because they were part of us, but not anymore;” “I was born and bred Labour, they were for the working man. But now they’re all bloody millionnaires, loads of them have got three or four houses. They’re hypocrites;” “Since Blair and Brown, Labour have become totally London-centric. If it doesn’t exist outside the Greater London area, they’re not really interested. They forgot about the real world. I can’t relate to what they’re talking about at all;” “They don’t know whateveryday life is like here. Especially when you’ve got all the Lithuanians, Poles, all the ethnic majorities in this town. They’re just used to their own social life;” “They just thought ‘we’ll do what we think is right for the working-class people,’ but a lot of people have moved on from the 70s, thank God.” This in turn helped explain why Labour seemed not to represent them in areas like immigration and welfare, on both of which the party was much too “giving”: “they seem to want to open the borders for everybody;” “They want to go back to the old way when people on benefits earned more than I probably do.”

&gt; “They take you for granted in places like this that they think are the heartland. But if you raise something they don’t like, it’s like Kiosk Keith –the shutters come down.”

&gt; “They want everyone dependent on the state in one way or another.”

Labour members on the party's disconnect on values:

&gt; In our Labour Movement focus groups, it was clear that some members and supporters recognised many of these problems, and even acknowledged that they themselves were in something of a bubble: “I was on holiday during the referendum and there were leave posters everywhere. Loads of people outside London wanted toleave. It really shocked me;” “Labour used to be a working-class party, but it has shifted to being an ultra-liberal party. It has lost its identity;” “The average person would probably agree with Labour’s principles but they’re dressed up in this super-liberal modern way, very woke, and some traditional Labour voters might find that a bit repellent;” “They may be from a working-class background but they have moved to better careers and salaries, and they hear these policies and think ‘that’s going to affect me’. Taxing what he thinks are high earners but are really not anymore, they’re standard middle-class earnings;” “What is a working-class person now? What does that look like? I don’t think they even know.”

&gt; Some members recognised a divide, but simply thought they were on the right side of it: “If I lived in a different part of the world that was more homogenous, I might think differently too;” “We fact-check the news, and I’m not sure everyone does;” “They have been duped. If they are being spoon-fed bythe media, they’re probably not seeing both sides of the argument. If you get both sides of the argument, how could you come to that conclusion?” “We’re not polar opposites, everyone wants their child to have a decent education, equal opportunities. So itjust comes down to morals.”

On who Labour stands for:

&gt; “It’s for young people and students, and the unemployed. It used to be for normal working people, who pay for their house, pay for their car;”“I don’t think they’re interested in supporting single mums, families, but affluent people with plenty of money who don’t need their help. If you’re working class, your priorities are paying the bills, keeping your car on the road, not keeping the swimming pool open or whether your kids have access to university. Middle class people are the ones who appear on Question Time;” “It used to be that the Conservatives looked after the rich and Labour looked after the working class. Now the Conservatives still look after the rich but Labour look after people on benefits. No-one looks after the middle, the working poor;” “Corbyn has a very big student following. Students don’t live in the real world, do they?”; “I do think they’re in a bubble in London. I don’t think they venture out to see what life is really like;” “Ethnic groups. They play that card all the time;” “First-time voters. They’re all about dropping the voting age to 16. That’s because they knew they’d lost us;” a current Labour supporter “probably lives in North London and they’re a college lecturer or something like that. A Hampstead socialist. A middle class radical;” “It was for middle-class people in London who go on marches to get rid of Brexit.”

&gt; Some also felt that the party had been taken over by activists whose agenda was far removed from that of traditional Labour supporters: “They say ‘we’ve got 300,000 members’, which are all quite young and left-wing and generally remain. So they’ve changed their principles on thatkind of minority. They’re ignoring the fact that the voters who don’t go to rallies and conferences, who just go out and do a day’s work, still go out and vote.”


&gt; “It’s for young people and students, and the unemployed. It used to be for normal working people, who pay for their house, pay for their car.”However, most thought remaining Labour voters tended to fall into one of two categories: older voters who were too set in their ways ever to change (“people like my mum who’s 84 and voted Labour all her life and on her way out”), or a basket that included young people, students, the unemployed, ethnic minorities and affluent middle class socialistswith fewmaterial concerns.

On Policy:

&gt; There was also a widespread sense that Labour’s policies would take Britain back to the past, whether on industrial relations, the benefits system or the nuclear disarmament debate: “He was taking us back to the 70s with all the strikes and power cuts. I thought, I don’t want to go that way, we’re a great country. And he would never say ‘we’re a great country’. He would talk about Palestine and all that sort of stuff but nothing positive about Great Britain;” “They were on about scrapping Universal Credit, but they didn’t say what they were going to do instead. Were they going to return to the old days when Blair and Brown were in charge, when people could choose whether they wanted to work for the rest of their lives or not?”; “He wanted to drop nuclear weapons. His stance on everything was so lovely and idyllic, but we’ve got Trump, Kim Jong Whatever, the world blowing up around us and we’ve got a guy waving the flag of peace. It’s not going to work.” Though they were not clear on the policy detail, many also felt Labour had an unduly soft approach to immigration: “It’s ‘come in, come in!’ Too much of an open-door policy.

&gt; ”Our Labour Movement focus groups were also critical of the 2019 manifesto, usually because of the array of policies and promises (“it was a bit like being on eBay”) which did not convince voters: “Free broadband –it was like someone in South America throwing money off the back of a lorry;” “The manifesto was fantastic, but can he do it in real life? It was like a fairy tale; people didn’t believe it.”

&gt; However, some members were disappointed or puzzled that the voters had rejected the programme: “It’s neoliberalism. People have been brainwashed that these things aren’t possible, but when I was a child, they were normal;” “They think capitalism is the only way. It’s baffling. People are screaming out for real change and he was offering a solution;” “There is an element of racism too. Especially the older generation.”",1581407886,"middle class people are the ones who appear on question time;” “it used to be that the conservatives looked after the rich and labour looked after the working class.","rich and labour","rich",NA,FALSE,"rich and labour","labour",NA,NA,1

His stance on everything was so lovely and idyllic, but we’ve got Trump, Kim Jong Whatever, the world blowing up around us and we’ve got a guy waving the flag of peace. It’s not going to work.” Though they were not clear on the policy detail, many also felt Labour had an unduly soft approach to immigration: “It’s ‘come in, come in!’ Too much of an open-door policy.

&gt; ”Our Labour Movement focus groups were also critical of the 2019 manifesto, usually because of the array of policies and promises (“it was a bit like being on eBay”) which did not convince voters: “Free broadband –it was like someone in South America throwing money off the back of a lorry;” “The manifesto was fantastic, but can he do it in real life? It was like a fairy tale; people didn’t believe it.”

&gt; However, some members were disappointed or puzzled that the voters had rejected the programme: “It’s neoliberalism. People have been brainwashed that these things aren’t possible, but when I was a child, they were normal;” “They think capitalism is the only way. It’s baffling. People are screaming out for real change and he was offering a solution;” “There is an element of racism too.

"fhaf330","Side note ""foregone,oligarch"" congrats you can write fancy words, look up what they mean before using them. Being rich doesn't make you an oligarch, being in direct control of a government makes you an oligarch. Most oligarchs are rich, but most rich people aren't oligrarchs. Also foregone means certain so you said 'at a certain point you're certain', which makes no sense in the conext of the sentace. This is reddit not the royal institute, write like a normal person because you're making a fool of yourself.

You want a great way to ruin your economy for everyone? Then take peoples money by force. The protection of private property is the foundation of economics. Taking the rewards people get for doing well is the quickest way to crash your economic system, and screw everyone over. That's why every communist system failed, because if starting a buissness or doing better won't put you ahead then everyone just coasts.

Billionaires are not inherently the enemy, our system which allows such inequality and promotes the hoarding of wealth instead of reinvestment is the issue. Obviously people like the koch brothers who work to make said system worse can go f*ck themselves, but taking all rich people's assets by force is not the solution. The solution is a system that makes rich people pay their share to give less well off better living standards and better economic opportunities.",1581407589,"most oligarchs are rich, but most rich people aren't oligrarchs.","rich, but most","rich","but",TRUE,"rich , but most","most",NA,NA,1

"fha1oic","If you truly feel like it shows off your voice and range, and you feel confident to sing it in front of an audience, then I say, go for it!

Do you and others that are auditioning for a spot go to vocal lessons? When I was preparing my audition for a Varsity spot in high school, many of us would go audition prep workshops and lessons at a local performing arts studio. Often, an instructor can not only help you on what you can improve in your voice and performance, but they will also help you pick out a great vocal piece to use for your audition!

I was normally a first alto, but when my instructor helped me tweak my breathing techniques (I used to try to feel my diaphragm expand, which helped me big time) I learned that I could also sing as a strong second soprano, too! Because of this, my instructor gave me a piece where I could showcase my entire range.

For “Turn the Beat Around,” that’s a great, energetic song that will bring the audience in! Just something to remember: it is a pop song, and often times, judges will look for if a singer is using diction. I know ours did, and often with pop songs, the vocals sound like “about chew” instead of “about you” and it drives them crazy! Make sure that the judges can understand the words you sing. 

One last thing: it’s okay to really get into it and move around! Get the crowd pumped! Bring out your inner Vicki Sue Robinson. I did a piece from a musical, in which the character that sang my song was a rich, but sneaky heiress who was actually a con artist, too. I decided to reflect that character in my audition and use a fair amount of much needed sass.

"fg2hlp1","Ever since I got into bourbon and rye seriously, one of dreams was to visit Mecca aka KY and do a barrel pick. Going just to do distillery tours sounded ok but a bit mundane and repetitive after you do the first one. I knew that I had to figure out a way to do a pick and decided I wouldn't go until I was able to do so. As an avid listener and patreon supporter of the Bourbon Pursuit Podcast, I took notice of their lotteries to accompany them on a pick. A few popped up but the timing was wrong for me work wise, they were mid week or just didn't work out logistically. 

Then a couple of months ago, out of no where, something amazing happened. Bourbon Pursuit announced they were doing a WFE bourbon and rye pick and you could sign up to join then. The dates seemed to work for me so i signed up and hoped for the best. Much to my surprise, I was randomly selected out of probably 500+ applicants. I was absolutely stunned, not only was i getting to go to KY to do a barrel pick but I was doing it at Willett with the bourbon pursuit crew. Unreal. A couple of weeks later, I booked flights and headed out to the bluegrass state. 

Me and 5 or so lucky listeners of the podcast got to go to Willett, meet with Drew and the rest of the gang, go into a rickhouse and pick out a bourbon and a rye barrel. We tasted two low entry proof, two wheated bourbons (one super unique one with a 25% rye backset), and two OG recipe high proof barrels one of which was on the top floor that was as hot as an oven. The group narrowed it down to a low entry proof barrel and the top floor OG recipe. The low entry proof was amazing, it was chewy and syrupy thick but was only around 108 proof. It was like a barrel proof michters 10 or something, very drinkable and approachable but full of flavor. When we tasted the top floor OG barrel, it was over 100 degrees up there and we all started sweating, so we pulled a sample and went a couple of floors down to taste it.  The top floor barrel was mature, powerful and had classic barrel proof in your face WFE bourbon notes. I am a sucker for low entry proof stuff, but the one we were considering ended up seeming less intense SBS with the high rickhouse floor bourbon, so we chose the top floor OG. I honestly wish we could have taken both. That bourbon has yet to bottled but will hopefully be ready soon.

We also chose a rye that day. The first one was at the bottom of the rickhouse and needed more time aging. The second had an insanely delicious tropical fruit character but an extremely short finish. We only ended up tasting three ryes (compared to 6 bourbons) as the third barrel was unanimously chosen immediately after tasting. We admittedly were running low on time but it was such a slam dunk we knew it was the one. We aren't 100% sure if it was a low rye rye or high rye, the barrel # suggests it is the low rye recipe. 

When trying to think of a name for the bourbon, we kept thinking back to how freaking hot it was on the top rickhouse floor. We ending up naming the bourbon ""... Milk was a bad choice"". A reference to the movie anchorman right after Ron B declares ""it is so damn hot"" which described the environment the barrel was aging in. An iteration on that theme, we went with another will ferrel name, which was Red Dragon, the car frank the tank has in old school. I didn't come up with the name ""Red Dragon"" but I did design the sticker! Not really a big deal but it ended up being bottled with ""selected by keg &amp; bottle"" on the neck tag instead of ""red dragon"" by mistake. 

This is my first taste of the rye which is my first time tasting a whiskey I personally selected. I couldn't be more excited about this. The bourbon review will be coming soon once it is bottled and shipped.

__________________________________________________________
**Willett Family Estate - Single Barrel Rye #1459 ""Red Dragon""""**

**59.6% abv 119.2 Proof** 

**7 Years Age Stated** 

**Color:** Dark Rust

**Nose:** Very low proof sting considering it is almost 120 proof. Big sweet notes of juicy fruit, honeydew melon, vanilla, honey, butterscotch, floral bouquet, light pepper and a touch of rye spice. Very sweet and decadent. 

**Palate:** Medium proof sting, thick, full mouthfeel. Notes of honey, peaches and cream, vanilla oak and barrel spice. The front palate is sweet and rich but it ends with a light prickle. Relatively mild spice compared to some other ryes. It drinks far below its proof and is definitely the low rye rye recipe. 

**Finish:** Mostly sweet but has a little spice prickle that lingers and glows for a long time.

**Overall:** I know that I am biased but this is delicious. It is dangerously drinkable considering the proof and has a thick full mouthfeel and fruity sweetness like a peach dessert. This is the first 7 year rye I have tasted from Willett to my knowledge and it is awesome. Their distillate continues to age and gets better and better every year. A lot of people lament the old sourced stuff going away but in 3-5 years their own distillate is going to 10-12 years old and ridiculously good.

**I am not going to rate this as it wouldn't be objective but it is among the best if not the best WFE ryes i have tasted from their own distillate.**

No, I did not. I looked it up on the internet and it said they were mixed race.

&gt;Did he?

[Yes](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-27569695). Why would they lie about that. They have no one to prove themselves to since they regard anarchism as a eurocentric ideology.

&gt;People with guns on patrol are a state apparatus or a mafia apparatus.

They might be a (non-hierarchical) mafia but a mafia is not a state. A mafia is an informal association of individuals. As opposed to a state you join a mafia out of self-interest and the structure isn't so rigid. The zapatistas had clear places they wanted to take over and there was no abstract ""progress"", ""peace"" or other fixed concepts they wanted to attain like a state would.

&gt;It is with the white collegiates the only ones with guns.

Are you a troll or something? Give me a sorce for this.

&gt;There are no bourgeoisie only indigenous and college whites with rifles.

Anyone who will try to claim exclusive ownership of indiginous land will be stopped.

&gt;The people in Mexico have each other but life improves in non-Zapatista areas more than in Zapatista areas.

Mexico is more neoliberal than the zapatistas. They have privilliges which deny workers' cooperatives the right to succeed even though they have less bureaucracy and are thus more efficient than our system of market stalinism (we have so much bureaucracy that it's worse than it was in the USSR). Those include bailouts for capitalist businesses and subsidies. The capitalist business not only that is bureaucratic but atomizes the work of each individual because they all have to compete with each other instead of cooperating. A system of workers' coops would bring people together more and would allow open discussion within the workplace which would lead to more innivation. They could use surplus gained from these developments to organize book clubs or other fun activities. This is what I ment, the zapatistas are more cooperative and closer to each other in this way. Maybe the problem with poverty is because of the welfare state or something, but wealth isn't the only factor. You can be very poor yet happy with friends and family beside you and you can be very rich but very alone as well, or your fiends only stay with you because of your money and you are painfully aware of this. Another factor that caused the zapatistas' poverty is that they don't make money through the black market like the other rebel groups do.

&gt;Are we? No.

"ffi8yxt","I am using the far extreme as a point of reference.

It is a false dichotomy to state that ""if you aren't poor, you're rich"" (which is what I feel many people in this thread are doing). Both rich and poor are the far ends of the spectrum. 

Income inequality has increased the number of people who are poor, and increased how rich the ""rich"" are, but that does not change the fact that there's still a huge range of people in between.

Yes, someone with even a tiny fraction of what Bill Gates has is still ""rich"" - but a tiny fraction of what Bill Gates has is still a millionaire. There are plenty of middle-class people who's life savings is 5 or 6 figures, and could handle paying $50k. It'd fuck up their retirement plans or something, but they wouldn't be financially destroyed.

Poet Kahlil Gibran said, “The deeper that sorrow carves into your being, the more joy you can contain.” We experience little genuine joy in part because we avoid the depths. We are an ascension culture. We love rising, and we fear going down. Consequently we find ways to deny the reality of this rich but difficult territory, and we are thinned psychically.

"fbtp32a","My powers was plain. 


The scientific community categorized it as Universal Linguist.


The ability to read, and speak any language known to sentient life.


Ancient scriptures? Easy, though the changes in grammar sometimes made it annoying to rewrite. Especially the much older languages.


Those pictographs on a cave wall? Yeah, it was about hunting animals. With your male genitalia.


Riveting.


So I passed time, traveling around the world. I saw, and talked to the locals. I was able to gain protected passages through rather hostile lands. All for the ability to translate things for various people.


Museums and Collectors of archaeological treasures. Those paid some big bucks to transcribe.


Not enough to make me rich, but enough to jump around the globe.


A few hours jotting down the findings, and then a week or four in a country.


Not a bad lifestyle, but not exactly sustainable in the long run. How many artifacts where there? How many cared to pay to have it translated?


While others flew, or altered the very fabrics of reality, I could read and write.


It wasn’t the best, but it was mine for now.


As the sole known Universal Linguist, I had inadvertently cornered the market. No one else was offering services on custom translations.


At least I was making a neat scrapbook out of my projects. No one ever complained so long as I never referenced where I found said artifacts.


It was a journal of sorts. Proof of my existence.


—


Then I found it.


In the island nation of Japan.


A traditional Japanese esoteric system called Onmyodo. It meant ‘The Way of Yin and Yang’.


Mister Takahashi, current head and caretaker had a set of paper dolls. These heirlooms were handed down for almost two thousand years. 


The Takahashi family was once an esteemed family of Onmyodo masters. Today they were a normal family by Japanese standards. 


Mister Takahashi desired to see if I could exam the faded set of scriptures. They had were written in the 10th century. Hand crafted by most prominent head of the Takahashi clan. 


The pay was good, and it was enough to let me stay in Japan for a full season. I said yes.


Like many collectors, and those who had heirloom pieces, the writing was rough. I could understand it, but chicken scribbles, was chicken scribbles.


I recreated the writing on another sheet. Then I double, triple, and quadruple checked it.


The language wasn’t quite Japanese, despite its resemblence on it. It was as if everything was a mash of Chinese, Japanese slang words. 


The sentences had little addendums. They refered to the classic 5 elements, yin and yang, and the Heaven / Earth polarity.


The current head of the Takahashi clan, had provided special inks. A combination of human blood, and squid ink, to recreate the original scriptures.


It was slow. I couldn’t use a pen, as it was to thin. So each line had to required forethought and patience.


Brushes was the best tool, and I retraced the fine and rather delicate work.


It was lucky that newer, small brushes were easy to create and use. It must have been a nightmare for the ancient people to have to make precise tools back then.


The days melted and blurred as I work.


The design was both simple, yet intricate. Words overlapped at times, creating unique hybrids that could mean several things. Confusing, but with my powers, legible.


It was quite beautiful when I finished. The long set of commands that would empower, and grant false life to an object.


It was quite cute, the wording and imagination.


I refolded the paper. It was still somehow flexible despite its age.


The dozen paper dolls lined up. A nice display of the refreshed words. With how the sentences crisscrossed, it was less of a set of instructions, and more of a work of art.


Mister Takahashi smiled as he stared at the repaired dolls. In his hands was my payment. With a satisfied smile, he handed it over.


As a final joke, I gave the man the list of commands.


Fly.
Speak.
See.
Dance.
Empower. (Magic ritual via command seals)


Mister Takahashi laughed, and spoke the command to dance.


We stared, and they did not move.


We laughed.


The first doll stood up, and began to flex its limbs. 


Our laughter died.


Then the second. The third.


The dozen dolls began to hover over the table I used across the two weeks for repairs.


They danced. They made jingling sounds that I had, at the time, thought odd. Now it made sense as they began to chime during pauses. 


We stared as they finished their dance, and then laid down. Still as the day I saw them.


Mister Takahashi stared. Then teared up as his family’s legacy became vetted. They were not a family of frauds and tricksters. They held prominent titles and station for centuries.


As specialists doing great work, and great deeds.


I stared down at my hands.


Maybe.


Just maybe.


Universal Linguist wasn’t a D class power after all.


If I could do this with paper, then what else could I use?


The thought of metals, and other materials came to mind.


As did the vast stores of work I had done before.


Other ‘mystic’ systems. Norse. North American.


It was all there, in my journal.


Which had now included Japanese mysticism.


If those worked, and I began to combine them…


Wouldn’t I become something more.


I said my goodbyes to the shell shocked man.


With a skip in my step, I made my way down to my hotel.


I pulled out my phone, and began to look for other artifacts.


It was time to do some serious reading.

"fbtcw8n","Not always, need diversity in mind which you only gain by valuing different perspectives equally. Judgements will only block your ability to understand another's views.

For example if you only listened to rich people you'd learn how to get rich but poor people can be wise too and there's reasons why somebody may be poor (materially) from intelligence, not ignorance - like Buddha. If the real Buddha personally gave you financial advise would you reject it just because he had no possesions?

"fb8azhu","&gt;Because this country has done a shitty job of making certain types (see:poor) of people pay consequences, and not such a great job of making wealthy people do so.

To a point. Have you actually worked with addicts before? I've seen people who were wealthy (not rich, but upper-middle class) completely lose everything due to addiction. The only people that can really skirt the consequences are those who are so wealthy they can just pay all the fines and essentially buy political connections. Even then, it's often only the legal consequences they avoid, their personal/family lives are typically destroyed anyway. 

Addiction really does not give a shit about your income or status, and if you're not politically connected, even fairly wealthy people can get completely obliterated by it. 

&gt;And because enough of the culture has decided that poor people deserve what they get, it's all about the ""responsibility"" they have to bear, instead of ""these are the programs we need to implement as a culture/society to help people afflicted by this""

"f6xkwiy","If there's a limited number of magic users and limited production speed this is not a post-scarcity world. This is, however, very close to the situation we will have in the not so distant future when the majority of the population doesn't have useful skills for society nor does society \*need\* them to work, while an elite of a few people are all that is necessary to run the world.   

It's important to note that through virtue of creating these conditions you've forced yourself into making this economy a pretty central theme of your world as it would not only be substantially different from our own, it would emulate a pretty likely situation in our non-magical future. So I'd advise that you take care and know what you're getting yourself into.   

&amp;#x200B;

Alternatively, if the costs are steep enough that it still makes sense to have regular human labor you'll still have an economy very analogous to our own. There are two common theories of value. One of them states that the value of things depends only on the value people that want that thing put in it. Non-magical people in that society would still value having certain objects highly, so according to that theory you can just have fiat paper money. You kinda need a magical way to avoid magical fake currency, but that doesn't seem like a huge deal.

  The second theory, and one that perhaps makes more sense when discussing variable scarcity, is often called the labor theory of value. This theory states that only human labor contributes to the value of objects.  This might not seem very intuitive, but if you think about it, the only reason you buy stuff is because you don't want to make them yourself (machinery transfers the labor necessary to create the machine into the product throughout its lifetime). 

Using the labor theory of value its we can quite easily transfer this to your world:

If its a world where most people still have jobs, nothing changes. Magicians are probably really expensive and fucking rich, but their place in society is similar to the place mineral extraction and agriculture has in ours. We can create plants out of pretty much nothing (they're renewable), they just take time and have a cost. That doesn't ruin the agricultural portion of our economy.  You'd just have precious metals function more like wheat, except less useful for the most part.  

Honestly, most theories of value only get trickier once you introduce scarcity of raw materials. So you're literally golden. 

Because I love this stuff, and I find it interesting, I think we can take a look at a society where only the mages work and everyone else can sit on their asses doing whatever the fuck they want. This type of society is very tricky. In essence, we could say in some developed countries this could be a reality. There's no scarcity of labor when unemployment values soar, in fact, unemployment values often soar because there's an excess of labor. This basically means the unemployed people could seat on their asses and society wouldn't collapse. Today, we just kind of ignore them, or throw them a bone in the form of welfare and call them lazy. However, when this percentage gets too big to ignore, things get interesting.

Wages as the major form of subsistence would become entirely unsustainable. Even if the mages were all enslaved by a few rich and powerful people that enforced a status quo similar to capitalist economy it would lead to massive famines as there simply isn't work to be had. No one would have money to buy the products the mages build.  

An alternative is that whatever mages build would be owned by everyone. Basically, this is communism and the mages are the means of production. In a post scarcity world this honestly just seems ideal. Implementing this would be hard, though.  In the real world we have it easy. Capital doesn't think and seldom has feelings even if some governments insist companies are people too. Here, the means of production are literally people. The only semi-enforceable thing that would keep the mages happy is a quota system enforced by civil duty of the mages. Its hard to imagine how such system would arise historically, but its not hard to imagine an order of the mages that enforces a sense of duty and responsibility. When a new mage is born it goes through magic school where is responsibility to society is imbued upon him.  It would be kind of interesting having mage in this almost angelic position of looking out for the common man. Perhaps even allowing mages to join human society for a year after they graduated, kinda like the Amish do.   I digress.

This is interesting because other alternatives I know about in a post-scarcity world are very centered around information and technology. But in the end, a post scarcity world really only has two paths: The one where everything is free, and the one where everyone starves. There is, however, a myriad of ways of organizing the world where everything is free. Token systems replacing money as we know it. Ranking systems for wealth distribution. Humans do like competition, so there would probably be some slightly asymmetrical way of distributing resources among the population according to what they actually did. Which is also kind of interesting. It's possible that even in a world where no one even needs to work to have enough to live the comfortable life working people live today, there'd still be social inequality and a fight for a better system. Humans are never really happy with what they have, that's why we're always improving.",1573251670,"even if the mages were all enslaved by a few rich and powerful people that enforced a status quo similar to capitalist economy it would lead to massive famines as there simply isn't work to be had.","rich and powerful","rich",NA,FALSE,"rich and powerful","powerful",NA,NA,1

Do people know how much easier their life is if their parents have enough money to cover/help with tuition? or good enough credit that they can borrow at an actually sustainable interest rate to help you with your school/business idea/house? 

They don't see themselves as having an advantage because they don't consider themselves to be wealthy and realistically they aren't. But that type of life where shit just works out for you and you don't even have to think about it is just wild. 

You want to talk about white privilege? What we're really talking about is the privilege accorded by financial security. Yes this does go beyond that when you start digging deeper into minorities being more likely to be pulled over, etc.. etc.. but at it's core this can all be traced back down to the privilege afforded by wealth. Growing up in an upper class neighbourhood you're going to come out dressing, walking, talking, and acting way different than if you grew up in a lower class neighbourhood. Where race comes into place is that for a number of reason's the number of people that have access to that mid-upper middle class of living tend to be white. 

I'm dating a girl right now that just doesn't comprehend the things I struggle with and some of the decisions I make or why I make them. Part of that is that she's 6 years younger than me but the main reason is that her parents are incredibly wealthy. Not rich, but wealthy. So she doesn't even realize the kind of advantage she's had her entire life because she just doesn't notice. You want to explain to white people what white privilege is if they're poor and white it's actually really easy to explain because it's the exact same fucking thing minorities deal with but racially motivated instead. Imagine not having to worry about how you act when getting pulled over? Well try to also imagine how life would be if you could just quit your job you hate and go back to school because your support system is able to carry you while you work through the issue.

"f4uhl8t","Both the UK and the EU are not so democratic as some people believe. To defend the thesis that the system is democratic, it is insufficient to refer to the formal system. One has to look on how it actually works. 

In the EU, there are huge ecinomic differences between the member states. The poorer states get money from the richer states. It is not free. A political and ideological pressure follows.

Those states that are afraid of their bigger neighbor are using the EU as a shield. There are previous members of the Soviet Union who are searching a protection against Russia. There is the Republic of Ireland that is searching a protection against the UK. 

Thus, there are member states that are manipulatable by the rich member states. 

This has created the system if political puppet regimes. 

The results of election depend on many factors: the money, the newspapers, the propaganda, etc.

European mainstream newspapers are together with the political power. It is even more so in smaller member states. The hidden censorship in the newspapers. Not many people are reading the alterbative media. 

Formally, the system endorses the single market and economic development. 

In reality, a huge bureaucracy system has been establihed. One and the same rigid rules are applied independently of geographical position. Huge amount of eurodirectives which are trying to regulate every detail of your life. 

The EU gives money to different projects. Among other things, it supports scientific and cultural projects. However, poorer countries heavily depend on those contributions. Who gives money also decides which projects are valuable. 

As a result, there exists a technique to influence cultural and scientific developments. 

It turns out that actually the EU is spreading some ideology that is prevalent in the headquarters. It is a massive ideological messianism, imposing one's values and thinking styles. 

Moreover, those who are criticizing such a system are labeled as ""nationalists"", ""nazis"", ""populists"", ""far-rights"", ""extremists"", etc. The enemies of the people. 

Introducing such a system is possible by references to the threats of Russia and of terrorism. It repeats the history of the US after the second WW: the so-called McCarthyism. 

The next steps are introducing the internet censorship, making censorship harder (see the EUP resolution on fake news and foreign meddling), establishing the European police (its machines have been used in Paris against yellow vests), establishing the European Army (in the beginning phase). 

What we have got is a system moving tovards authoritarianism and totalitarianism (a form of fascism, if you prefer that word). And it is not anymore an union of national states. 

Perhaps all this is useful to big international corporations, I do not know.

So, I agree that the EU is actually not democratic. Those states were the ""wrong"" government has been democratically elected, have been punished and labeled as ""rogue states"" (Hungary, now also the UK).

I also agree that such a system can be called as fascist, while I think that better term is ""totalitarianism"". 

So you have a choice: to live in a rich but totalitarian system and being a slave of it; or to try to get free, while being poorer.

"f22onx6","Con survived WW1, they'll survive Brexit.

A much larger context is needed here: our modern conception of Con began with the restoration, when monarchists chose to build an empire to cover up and avoid dealing or managing difficult questions at home, leading to the adoption of unrestricted trade with the rest of the world and with it modern capitalism and industry. This worked well until WW1 wherein the whole system fell over once great demands were placed upon industry. Con couldn't just be the party of rich, but peaceful, traders.

Reasons ranged from ""oh my god you are going to start preaching to people about veganism, so annoying"" to ""so you will not eat the food I cook for you, disgraceful"" to ""that is so unhealthy, we need meat to survive"".

Never in a million years did I imagine my dietary choices will have such a huge emotional impact on the people close to me. Needless to say, no one has been supportive so far.

"ew3lcho","It's a good strategy for having people take taleb less seriously and squandering what support he has left. 

&gt;Nassim Nicholas Taleb and Claire Lehmann seemed like natural allies: Both are contrarian, entrepreneurial free thinkers. But recently, Taleb started calling Lehmann names on Twitter.

It was worse than calling names. He accused her of promoting  ""neo-Nazi 'scientific' racism."" If twas very close to flat out calling  her a neo nazi.

Not once in the entire exchange did  Taleb offer any data or rebuttal of any specific argument made by Claire or a Quillete article. Just insults. There was no weight behind any of Taleb's punches.   

Honor means that one can legitimately lay claim to moral high ground through virtue, but Taleb ceded any high ground through his actions. 

Taleb's argument is that IQ tests do not accurately measure intelligence on the high-end of ability. For example, there are many high-IQ people who are not rich but many average-IQ people who are. No one denies this, but in the aggregate, wealth and IQ are correlated. 

Consider three groups of people:

-the general population {IQ 100}

-a group of high IQ people picked at random from the general population

-Google employees 

The odds of anyone in the first group working at google is very slim. Maybe .01%

The odds of anyone in the second group working at Google is maybe 1%.

The odds of everyone the third group having a high IQ is about 100%. There are very few average-IQ ppl  working at Google. 

So Taleb thinks that because the second group is such a poor predictor for the third group that IQ is meaningless. This is a common misconception. 
The correlation becomes much higher then one narrows down the data set. 

So regarding wealth vs IQ, when one excludes athletes and actors, the correlation between high net worth under the age of 40 and IQ is quite high. Taleb is using 1970's data in which the correlation between wealth vs IQ is lower than it is today.

""**MAY THIS LAND HONOUR KRYPTON, SHOULD HE EVER REAWAKEN**""       

That done, she invited her daughter, now Viridian Scale, to join her. The girl had grown into a chaotic young woman, with no real true form as she changed continuously, and she was elated at the chance to wield divine power for herself as Green Omen taught her how to change and create the world around her. True to her spheres, the results were chaotic.         

Secretly, Scale absorbed some of the divine power into herself, eager to continue creating new life.   

------------    

##The Writhing Riverlands      

Created by Viridian Scale, the Riverlands occupy the lower south east of Alfheim continent. Mutliple large streams grow from the mountains, and merge into powerful rivers and deltas as they meet the sea.     

Most life in the Riverlands goes through multiple stages in its life cycle, with small tadpole like newborns, and varying adult stages based on external stimuli. Turtle-like creatures, amphibious wolves, enormous salamanders and bloated eels might all share the same species, but separate into breeds as they mature and cross breed. Similarly the plantlife is very adaptable and prone to mutation, with many magrove trees, spongy mushrooms, landborne coral reefs and algae colonies forming.   

The land as a whole is very fertile and rich, but unpredictable, with many hazards for the unprepared.

Mind you, I'm not the least french nor black. Maybe old to some but far from rich. 

Hell, I even grew up with the 90's girlpower cartoons. There were plenty of female characters that kicked ass and still so. Can't say I ever felt disempowered. Never felt empowered either just because some male character did a thing.

"ei4pewl","Distillery - The Antigua 


Age - 6 year old


Abv - 66%


Other info - 218g/hlpa (note this isn't just esters)



I've got about half a dozen reviews ready to post  however a couple of you seemed intrigued by this Velier that I posted in a recent pic so I thought I'd rush this out.


Today we have a Velier bottled,  Antigua Distillery (English Harbour) column still rum aged for 6 years in ex bourbon barrels. 



Nose
Wow straight away this smells special and not a hint of its 66%.,  Grilled pineapple, caramel, flambeed banana, vanilla, cinnamon. Its smells decadent. That rich buttery nose you get from rums that usually have additives. This just goes to show that rum done right  doesnt needed extra additives. Demarara sugar now and more butter, caramelized figs. This keeps on giving and I'm happy to keep sniffing for a while to savour this one. 


First Taste
Again...wow. Ive had rums at 20% less abv that werent as smooth as this baby. Buttery rich rum. Damn this is good. This is everything I love in rum. Think bananas pan fried in butter, brown sugar and fresh vanilla pods. Caramelized figs with cinnamon. A little bit of oak, a hint of raisin. Medium finish, and fades away beautifully, no oaky tannins that you can sometimes be left with.


Now normally I have a couple of sips for my first taste and make notes then a few more sips for a second taste and compare. I've just drained a whole glass for my first taste so time to pour fresh. That in itself should tell you something.


Second glass
Thought about adding a bit of water but fuck that. No need, no way.

Everything's still there just as rich and rummy as the first sip and I still cant get over this is 66%abv. This is dangerous. Normally takes a sip or two of the higher abv for my palate to start getting the flavour but not with this, 2 glasses in and this tastes the same as the first sip,  delightful.


Overall
I read an interesting article by a professional spirits judge about how he scores. He said one of the key things he looks for is that the flavors on the nose are also there on the tongue. That's certainly the case here,  the banana and sugar and vanilla, the hint of spice, it's all there in the nose and palate..


Now, I've sat here for a while trying to pick up different flavors but the biggest flavour of all is rum. I dont know if that makes sense to you but to me this is how a rum should taste. Sweet but not sickly. Rich but not cloying. Fruity and a bit spicy and just absolutely yummy. Its not a super high ester jamaican funk bomb, and not  grassy, briney  and spice laden. Its tasty, it's easy, it's the rum I'll reach for when I feel like RUM. 


I'm gushing and rightly so. 


By the time this is posted I would have ordered a couple more bottles to put away. Another win for Velier. 


If you want a second opinion both rumshop boy (91/100) and Lonecaner (88/100) have reviews up on their websites. 


Verdict
Get online and get one, its $130 in Australia which is cheap for even a semi decent spirit however I've seen it on European sites for 50euro. That's insane for something this good at 66%abv.


Its fucking delectable.

"ei4ou6c","Good question.

""Society"" as a whole, as a construct, treats beta men very well. The reason we have laws, and concepts such as justice, equality etc. is so that beta men and women continue to believe in the system, continue to work in the system, don't get too shafted so as to revolt and occasionally have some of them rise up to be moderately rich but spineless servants to the world. Concepts such as patriotism were made to keep beta men going-""thank you for your *service*"". Nixon's kid's wouldn't end up in Vietnam. 

If it were up to Alphas, we would still live in pre-industrial, possibly agricultural societies, because they rule by force and social manipulation. Remember, the concept of tribal leaders arose around who was genetically the most superior, stronger etc and then it became hereditary because it was noticed that genetics essentially, that the strongest tended to be the children of the Alpha king. Monarchy has however been unsustainable. It's the most popular form but it breeds dissent, it breed the 'why not me' amongst the proletariat. This has what has always lead to ""revolution"". No, better to feed them lies of equality of opportunity and the American dream. The founding fathers never wanted the people to be in control.

So society bends over backwards to ensure betas continue to serve and are compensated with scraps on the table for it, as a group. However, individual betas always end up disillusioned or hopelessly servile, but they never find happiness, because they believe the media, shoving the female imperative down their throat, the ideals of justice anencephaly morality, and so they believe that women will bring them happiness, that if they play by the rules they'll be ok, that's it's normal to be fucked over. If they wake up more they will drug themselves with alcohol or porn and continue to serve the machinery of women and Alphas, of paying alimony, of raising kids that aren't yours, of falling in love again and again and again with single mothers who cheat on them. They never wake up. Thanks Billy Beta, I smoke my cigar on you right corpse, just because you never dared to wake up. You needy, pathetic, spine less, pathetic waste of time *spits* hahahah.

So, in no particular order, just the order of me remembering what I've used.

* CeraVe PM: Currently using. Not moisturizing enough for nighttime but I mix with squalane and use in the daytime over toner and under sunscreen. 
* Aveeno Intense Relief Overnight Cream (fragrance free): I bought this to use on my feet and in a fit of desperation used it on my face. And goddammit it works on my face... Very lovely and super moisturizing. Helped me recover my moisture barrier when hardly anything else would. 
* CeraVe Cream: Did absolutely nothing for me. Not nearly as moisturizing as is insisted on SCA. 
* CeraVe Lotion: Also did absolutely nothing for me and is even less moisturizing than the cream, but layers better with other skincare. 
* The Ordinary NMF: Not moisturizing enough. A basic inexpensive moisturizer. 
* Shiseido Bio-Performance Advanced Super Revitalizing Cream: This was a great cream, but expensive for what it did, and I felt like I needed a lot of product to get enough moisture. 
* Elizabeth Arden Skin Illuminating Brightening Hydragel Cream: A lovely very moisturizing gel cream. I did see some brightening but mostly it was moisturizing. Didn't feel that it matched the price. 
* Clinique Moisture Surge Intense: This was okay. I felt like I went through it very quickly but it was nice and moisturizing. 
* Bioderma Sensibio AR Cream: A very rich and soothing cream. More moisturizing than some others I've tried but I didn't see any crazy results over time. 
* Cetaphil for Dry Skin: No effect. Didn't moisturize my skin at all. 
* Embryolisse Lait-Creme Concentre: I don't get the hype behind this. A very basic moisturizer and didn't provide enough moisture. 
* Avene Cold Cream: Very thick, very traditional cold cream. More emollient than moisturizing. Didn't love it. 
* Klairs Rich Moist Soothing Cream: Very nice and rich but it broke me out :/ 
* Neutrogena Healthy Skin Anti-wrinkle Night Cream: Very mild retinol cream but it dried my skin out. 
* Olay Total Effects 7-in-1 Moisturizer and Treatment Duo Fragrance Free: Dried my skin out. 
* Kiehls Super Multi-Corrective Cream: This is one of the best I've used. Really nice and moisturizing. No irritation even though it has some plant oils in it (some Kiehls and I do not get along). 
* La Roche Posay Cicaplast Baume B5: Dried the shit out of my skin. Didn't help healing any faster than any other product. 

The hunt continues. Maybe I won't ever find a HG but in the mean time I'm having fun!

"egiialy","There's also the economic war being waged by the right-wing bourgeoisie within Venezuela. They hoard or destroy goods, or smuggle them into Colombia. Stores are full in the neighborhoods of the rich, but empty in the neighborhoods of the working class. This is the root of the shortages that anti-Venezuelans love to cry about. Venezuelan right-wingers love wailing about it too even though it's of their own making and they're unaffected by it. Those who are affected by it, the working class, are overwhelmingly on the side of Maduro and the PSUV. They know who's really responsible.

The only fault of the Venezuelan government in this situation is that they've, thus far, been unwilling to take the kind of hard action necessary to stop it. When they discover a warehouse full of goods that are supposed to be in stores, they seize the goods, but it rarely goes beyond that. They don't arrest enough of the people doing this, they don't seize the capitalist enterprises, they continue to allow the right-wing bourgeoisie to control the levers of the economy, which the right-wing bourgeoisie continues to use to try to squeeze the government and starve the proletariat into submission. The government releases right-wing trash from prison as a gesture of ""goodwill"" toward vermin who are incapable of reciprocating it. They plead endlessly for talks to resolve the situation peacefully even as right-wing goons murder socialist activists and supporters of the government on a regular basis. They sometimes jail individual criminals, but never go after the enemy class as a whole.

Far from the ""tyrannical dictator"" the US media portrays him to be, this cold-hearted iron-fisted caricature of American Cold War propaganda, in reality Maduro is treating the right-wingers with kid gloves, being far nicer than he should or they deserve.

"ed0oqv6","Does what you're doing meet your needs? It seems like a lot of productivity recommendations are biased toward complexity, but if no bells and whistles are getting the job done, why change it?

If not, the first question to ask is: how do you view your life, and what you would like to accomplish? Do you have ""Personal"" and ""Professional"" tasks? If so, that is a great framework to begin organizing. A great reference for how to *structure* your tasks is David Allen's [Getting Things Done.](https://gettingthingsdone.com/) Don't feel pressured to be a ""GTD purist"": IMO, GTD is tactically rich but strategically variable, depending on who uses it.

If you are having trouble with prioritizing those tasks, try [the Eisenhower Matrix](https://www.eisenhower.me/eisenhower-matrix/) until you get more of a handle on your own priorities.

I forgot about how creepy, manipulative, and pushy he is in the early chapters that gets handwaved away because he's hot, smart, and rich, but suspending disbelief is the best way to enjoy this series. As long as you realize that this romantic drama is fantasy and wouldn't fly in reality, you're in for a taboo treat.

 Not many other series makes me this invested in the relationship even though it's wrong on so many levels. He's married to the female MC's look-a-like and he does a lot of messed up things, but the mood, tone, and paneling makes me root for the couple's adultery. They're both adults so this series doesn't shy away from sex or skinship, and instead of building up to sex like many other series, the focus of the story is about the FMC's internal conflict and character development due to meeting to the MMC. 


It's essentially an atmospheric and nuanced kdrama with exceptional storytelling and artwork. I enjoy this as much as &lt;Sekine no Koi&gt; because mangaka are fantastic at emotional impact and delivery.

Dreams are in 6 groups : one group are truthful dreams that are meaningful and predicting with symbolic metaphors based on holy books.

Another one is Deja Vu dreams that are seen as will happen.

Another group are psychological dreams as Mr. Freud and Mr. Jung said.

A group are Messy dreams that are caused by bad food or drinks and have no meaning.

A group are direct and truthful dreams about the deceased people or when saint people speak and say a news about our past or future.

A group are causative dreams that a reason like heat or cold or repetition is caused the dream.

Dreams are pre-written destiny said in these allusions of holy books once again,

What I am doing is trying to introduce this kind of symbols and truthful meaningful dreams.

  

A brief about the dreams:

Dream language interpretation is an ancient science of allusions and pointing of the surrounded environment, the events are like train stations which exist and we are moving towards them, these are prewritten destiny with some authority ( in decision making seconds) in very full details. This dream language should be translated, and interesting to know it is universal and common for all human beings. But ignorance causes some misunderstanding..People were not aware of this language and always thought in a bad way , for example Mr. Freud said about sexual dreams it is because you have suppressed your sexual desires so misled everybody and some women dreamt about having sex with co-workers or another and thought they should do that, while it only meant he will do something for her, or some others dreamt had sex with the same sex and invented homosexual, while it meant the same ,Also some men dreamt his wife had sex with a man and didn't understand or a woman dreamt her partner had sex with a woman and didn't' understand ...etc.Do you see what catastrophes are caused by misunderstanding a language. About the approximate interpretation time table: Dreams at noon or exactly at midnight( In the summer time 13 at noon and 1 midnight else at 12)in the same day if past a few minutes, a few days later. Dreams at 10-11 in the morning in 15-30 days later. Also dreams at 3-4 in the evening in 1-2 months .Dreams in the sunset mostly are not truthful and are messed, they have no interpretations, Dreams at 4-5 in the morning in a few days to 2 months some dreams in the holy books( Josef dream of kneeling the sun and the moon and 11 stars)was interpreted after 20 years and other dreams of the Pharaoh's prisoners interpreted in the same day and after 7 years. Dream of Pharaoh about the 7 thin cows and 7 fat cows interpreted from the next year to 14 years. Also dreams in 6th of the month will interpret after 1-2 days, in 9th at the same day, in 10th after 20 days, in 13th after 9 days in 14th after 26 days and in 15th after 3 days, in 16th after 2 days and in 28th ,29th ,30th in the same day, but these are solar (Persian months and you should refer to a calendar or convert them) . Of course there are different kinds of dreams , like messy dreams which have no interpretations or deja vu dreams, or psychological dreams or dreams which are caused by bad food or drinks.

"e57ewi5","In Europe: mail, brigandine, and coats-of-plate were common before plate. Those armours worked against the main threats on the battlefield, including arrows. Heavy mail (often with textile armours both under and above it) could stop lances and crossbow bolts. Effectiveness is largely a function of thickness - heavy mail can be more protective than thin plate, and thick plate will be more protective than lightweight mail.

Exactly how mail compares with other armours weight-for-weight is a bit of a mystery - there is little good data. The flexibility helps against penetration by arrows, since some of the energy of the arrow goes into moving the armour rather than piercing the armour (and the same will be true for brigandine and lamellar).

Brigandine, lamellar, and plate all have one important advantage over mail when trying to make very protective armour: they can be made thicker without making them less flexible, while thicker mail will be less flexible. (Of course, all of them will be heavier when thicker.) Thicker mail might also require significantly more labour, which will add to the cost. Generally, for both mail and plate, the bulk of the cost is labour, rather than the iron/steel. (See Williams 2003, pg 904, for a discussion of the cost of armour.)

In addition, the protection provided by plate grows faster than the thickness, with doubling the thickness improving the protection by about 3 times (approximately, protection is proportional to thickness^1.6 or, if you want a simpler approximation, close to thickness squared). This is important for thick armours designed to stop threats such as bullets (see Atikins 2009, Williams 2003).

One reason why mail declined in Europe was that plate armour became cheaper than mail (not the fancy custom-made carefully fitted suits of plate for the rich, but cheap munition plate for the common soldier). When a munition plate half-armour costs 3/4 of what mail would cost, it can be the preferred option, even if it is no more protective (similarly, such plate would be cheaper than brigandine).

Late plate armour (e.g., for pikemen) often had tassets functionally similar to the ""skirts"" on Japanese armours: https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/22730 This kind of skirt/tasset is a convenient way to protect the upper leg, without requiring the armour to be flexible or carefully fitted to the individual wearer.

"e4vyhmq","&gt;In my country 11.5% of families have more than 3 kids, so let's say around 3% of families will have 4+ kids. It's cheaper to process a couple of hundred thousend of applications than 18 millions

Retirement age is 60 for men and 65 for women; life expectancy is 73.8 for men and 81.6 for women; the VAST majority of population will apply for retirement anyway; and these applications will be processed anyway. It seems that you think that if men got similar privileges to the ones women enjoy now, they would massively apply for pension that they aren't eligible for or something, just to waste the time of social security agents; I'm pretty sure that I made my case on this - you are defending discrimination. I've got nothing against it in principle; I'm against the practice across the entirety of the West that discrimination is good only if it benefits women at men's expense; preferably at the expense of men who never got a single handjob from these women. This is why, I believe, it's so often either extremely hard or impossible to allow one's wife to inherit any significant portion of the husband's retirement entitlements.

&gt;This initiative is 100% religious, no threats have been issued.

I looked it up, and apparently you're right; thumbs up for Poland that didn't pour taxpayer money into this initiative; in some other nations tho, baby hatches were installed on taxpayer money after the proposed initiative motivated with ""if we don't do it, they'll kill the ~~hostages~~children"".

&gt;having a human being come out of your insides is pretty trippy, I'm surprised it's punishable at all (within like 10 days of birth)

Not every woman develops post-partum depression, and those who do - don't face punishment at all. Killing a newborn is the least punishable homicide when it is **proven** in the court of law that the woman who committed it was sane at the moment of the crime. At least it's the case for my nation. But thanks for honesty, you think that it should be legal for women to kill because they get trippy; why don't we allow women to kill anyone within 10 days after giving birth?! You know, hospital nurses, doctors, husbands; who cares.**/s** (my kid's mother approves of allowing women to kill the nurses in delivery hospitals, tho :) ) Just so you know - according to multiple studies, in random samples, between slightly-below-half and vast majority of male violent criminals contained in prisons pass the diagnosis criterions for various mental conditions, such as ADHD and ASPD; recent studies managed to filter out several specific genes highly influential of antisocial behavior in men. These guys are born ""pretty trippy""; nobody cares. They still get punished.

&gt;It was implemented last year, and I'm not a pensioner. The chances of this law outliving this political term are slim, we'll see

Perfectly reasonable. I have huge doubts that I'll survive until retirement age; and it's twice as sad that the law won't allow any significant part of my pension money to be inherited by the woman who gave birth to my kid, or by my kid, because the vast majority of this money got wasted on alcoholic single moms on welfare.

&gt;You get your kid on the weekend, you can work 60h. Your ex probably can't

The sentence about ""mandatory 15 minutes a week"" was sarcastic (I spend way more than weekends with the kid), and No; the reason men so often end up as primary breadwinners is because [women seek relationships with men who have better career prospects than themselves](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0003122418784909?journalCode=asra&amp;). I would have gladly married a daughter of bank mogul who is about to inherit his business, and spend my best years looking after our kids (it would have been economically sound to let me do the babysitting, and to let her do the career thing); but, the problem is, female heirs of bank moguls don't marry masters of technology; they marry sons of senators. Thus, gynocentric ""taxation pump"" essentially serves as an instrument to punish men for women's hypergamy (the funniest part is that I once tried to court a daughter of bank mogul, and at some point she just ghosted me). I'm aware of only one prominent example of a famous and rich woman who had a ""simple guy"" fetish - Madonna. She still married a man who was probably not as rich, but still famous (director of ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels""; and ended up getting dumped and divorce-raped for several million by him).

&gt;""because women claimed that doing it through the institution of marriage is not fair"" - It's not like women issued a petiotion. The institution of marriage is buggy, people are shit at being married and at being parents and what followed were laws to secure money for the kids that those couples created. What alternative is there? 

It is [**exactly** like women issued a petition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declaration_of_Sentiments); not to mention that the rise of gynocentric welfare states universally coincided with women getting the right to vote, and shift from taxing the property (which, after abolition of coverture, men and women enjoyed equally) to taxing the income (produced predominantly by men) happened after French revolution, started by women's march on Versailles. The alternative is simple: fiscal conservatism. If you let men have their fairly earned money, the vast majority of them will spend said money on their beloved women and children, just as they did for the entire human history. I mean, you've spent almost the entire comment chain arguing from the position of women's ""moral goodness"" (as far as justifying murder); if you are ready to admit any sort of virtue on the part of men, then this is the closest to the truth you'll ever get. The only people except state rats who benefit from the current state of affairs - are women who are loved by no-one.

&gt;There's a shitload of details that make life a nightmare on parents, they need to be adressed one by one 

Fair enough; what I surprisingly found out is that even in nations that went through demographic cataclysms in 20th century, rural fertility rate very rarely fell below 2, and almost never fell below 1.9. *Maybe* the entire fertility problem is due to over-urbanization, and it'll solve itself as soon as rural areas get Internet cables fast enough to allow people to play WoW, LoL, and Overwatch.",1535324999,"i'm aware of only one prominent example of a famous and rich woman who had a ""simple guy"" fetish - madonna.","famous and rich","rich",NA,FALSE,"famous and rich","famous",NA,NA,0

**The Schtick:** This was a whiskey I enjoyed blind while I reviewed it live on the [Whiskey Network Discord server](https://discord.gg/MpwvFsC).



-----

**Distiller:** The Macallan		

**Bottler:** Gordon &amp; MacPhail Speymalt Collection

**ABV:** 43% ABV

**Age:** 18 Years

-----

**Nose:** Funky, musty, fruits. Mud. Oak. Cocoa, toffee, sugary butterscotch. Apple crisp. Sourdough bread. 

**Taste:** Medium mouth feel, sweet. Dole fruit syrup. Really sweet. Faint heat. Confectioners sugar, vanilla cream. Apple pie. Pears. Faint lemon lime zest. Really creamy, almost some buttered popcorn.

**Finish:** Short, not super rich, but sweet and fruity. Faint oak structure here, lightly effervescent. Some bittering with time. No real smoke, brine or pepper. Faint plastic. Sweet, faint sulfur.

**Overall + Guess:** I liked this. It really kept me guessing. If it's peated, it's super subtle. The only real indicators I get is some faint burning plastic on the palate. Nothing really Islay driven. It has a great nose and some nice structure in the body. The palate is sweet, creamy, fruity, buttery and only sort of bitter. Like a buttery Chardonnay and some woodiness, but it's light and wispy. I can see there may be some wine influence here. Either that, or it's an incredibly light brandy product. I don't think that's the case, though. I'm guessing this is a 14-18 year old scotch whiskey, it is bottled at 46% ABV. Unpeated, maybe some refill sherry, but definitely nothing full maturation. This might be a Glenfiddich or Glenlivet, Ben Nevis or Unpeated Caol Ila. The fruity, bready, sweet creamy profile is glaring, but I can't put a finger on the exact distillery. GAAAAh.

**Reveal:** Speymalt The Macallan 18yr 1998 43% ABV - damn! I was so close. I've had IB Macallan before and I'm a little miffed I missed out on those notes. However, I feel pretty confident in nailing the age, getting close on the proof, and generally doing well with the profile. Super cool stuff, here. 

Thanks for reading!

"e4jyem9","Looking over your post history, you are a walking straw man argument.

The USA and European countries are not socialist, and do not have socialist policies.  They are social polices(safety nets for when capitalism fails, as it so often does) for  welfare states with a capitalist mode of production(Europe having significantly more, and better nets, American Bootstrap theory can bugger right off). Not a social policy but,  giving money to businesses is corporate welfare, and is pushed for by the capitalist class, at the expense of the working class.  The rich don't get richer under socialism, you're thinking capitalism, and the more unregulated the faster they get rich.

[https://imgur.com/gallery/LokT9](https://imgur.com/gallery/LokT9)

Seriously man your take on economic and political theory is an absolute joke.

If you think Nazis are socialist because its in their name, I have to wonder what you think about; sea horses, hot dogs, starfish, chicken in a biscuit, and praying mastitis. I'll give you a hint on the last one, they look like they are praying, but they are not, just like how the Nazis tried to look like socialist but they are not.

You have over 70 years of political, historical, and economic data that states that Nazis are not socialist, but because it says it on the tin, it got to be true.  If you believe that, I've got some land on Alderaan to sell you.

And to state again most businesses were still privately owned (by the likes of  Ferdinand Porsche and Alfried Krupp, another one of my points you passed over and ignored) , and the Nazis created privatization (As pointed out bey the other person that replied, but you have failed to acknowledge).  These are not socialist ideas.  Socialists don't want the government to just give away free money ( also not its NOT free, because it is your tax money) to workers. I'll say it again for the people in the back, socialists want the workers; not the capitalist, the bankers, the investors, to own(whole and completely) the means of production.

Government intervening in the economy does not a socialist economic system make.

What is you basis for Trump fooling all of America? Polls seem to say something different

[https://poll.qu.edu/national/release-detail?ReleaseID=2561](https://poll.qu.edu/national/release-detail?ReleaseID=2561)

Most people do not care of the tax cuts, because  they are massive for the rich but mediocre for the middle and poor class.  His increased government spend is on the militarily and on corporations hurt by his tariffs (also a right wing point) , which leftists are against.  He is strong on anti immigration (right wing, Nazis didn't want anyone in there country, AND wanted back land they said was German), Pro military spending and intervention when it affects businesses at home, strong on tax cuts (right wing, and interesting that you consider that left, when the left is supposedly ""big government""), pro businesses discriminating against certain people(right wing, something the Nazis were cool with), deregulation of businesses and the government not interfering with businesses(right wing, but they love giving the large ones bail outs, because of campaign donations, so hypocrisy), the right is all for being fiscally conservative when they are not in charge, but when they are they blow money on the above.

So if it looks like left wing disguised as right wing, you need to use some of that ...ahem... ""Socialist"" healthcare and get you eyes checked, because being blind will not do wonders for you engineering career. And again Hitler was right wing so your phrase should be:  Right-wing disguised as left-wing if you ask me, like in the old days of Hit...nevermind"" But seeing as Trump is right wing and is committing to right wing polices that help out the capitalist class, hot take is false.

A reminder hot takes are only good and only sound cool when they are relevant. Otherwise you look asinine and illiterate on the subject.  I gave you an out, with that video so that you could see you were wrong and move on, but all you are doing is showing how poorly versed you are on this subject.  Whether it is because someone has told you wrong, or through blind ignorance you have little to no idea what you are referencing.  The side bars have some wonderful study guides and resources on the subject of socialism and communism.

I said it yesterday, I'll say it again today.

Post it on

That is the subreddit for debating on communism, and socialism.  Once more the Nazis are not socialist, but since you are willing to take that ""fact"" , actually fake news fits really well here, to the cross with you, post your argument there and defend it, if you are willing to learn more on the subject, as you said you did.  Since what I post is not good enough for your perverted idea of what socialism is.

So you have to wonder why medical insurance is so expensive and car insurance so cheap. My car insurance is $88 a month when I live stateside. My health insurance is $2200 a month. Why? Regulation. Car insurance has been deregulated and companies like Geico and Allstate can sell nationwide. Only 5 health insurers are allowed to sell in all 50 states. The other thousand or so are relegated to just a few states. Because regulation, because congressmen were bought. The problem isn’t corporations. It’s that democrat or republican, we’ve allowed the government to get too big. We’ve let it interfere where we don’t need interference. We do need an FDA and an EPA but we don’t need the government choosing which companies can operate where, if they’re legal. In true capitalism everyone competes and the bad companies fail. If they’re expensive, immoral, offensive, eventually they fail. Look what happened to Roseanne Bar. That’s the free market working thru a problem w/o government intervention.

**From Peter Katis himself: \[I've compiled his posts below\]**

*Hi, everybody. Is it too late to respond to this thread???*

*The vocal chain for most all of the BOXER LP was a Telefunken* [*ELAM 251*](https://www.gearslutz.com/board/gear.php?t=ELAM%20251) *into a Telefunken V276 (solid state) pre into a Klein &amp; Hummel UE-200 EQ into a Chandler TG1 compressor (Limit Mode, quickest release) into an SPL de-esser into a* [*Gates STA-Level*](https://www.gearslutz.com/board/gear.php?id=5799)*compressor into an Apogee ADX16 A/D converter into ProTools HD. Long chain, I know! All sessions were 24bit/44.1kHz.*

*The drum set ups on the album were a little different for almost every song. Some songs had over a dozen mics and some as few as only one mic (plus overdubs). Some songs hit tape and some went straight to ProTools. We really tried to NOT make every song sound the same.*

*The song we actually used only one mic on was called ""You've Done It Again, Virginia"", but the song ended up a B-side. I don't know when or where it will come out, but it's kind of a cool drum sound. The drums were played very softly and sparsely and recorded with the mic very overdriven and severely low-passed. In the end, I also hand placed dry snare hits over every snare hit with a sample we made for the song ""Gospel"".*

*The think the drums on Gospel were recorded with just one mic, one drum at a time, but I'm not certain because they were recorded in the basement which we generously called ""Studio B"" more like percussion overdubs after most of the other music and vocals were finished.*

*Songs like ""Slow Show"", ""Apartment Story"" and ""Squalor Victoria"" were simple five mic set-ups recorded with pretty aggressive EQ and compression straight into ProTools. Songs like ""Fake Empire"", ""Mistaken For Strangers"", ""Brainy"", etc. were recorded with a bigger set up (in&amp;out of kick, top&amp;bottom of snare, toms, ohs, hh, front of kit, stereo rooms, very distant room) and went to a Studer* [*A827*](https://www.gearslutz.com/board/gear.php?id=1073) *2"" @15ips/CCIR w/ Quantegy456 and then into PT. Probably never turned on the overheads or hihat mics. ""Brainy"" had T-shirts over all the drums.*

*I think I've recorded guitars a million different ways (different combinations of mics/placement/pres/compressors/tape VS no tape/etc.). But in truth, most of the time that I'm recording ""regular electric guitars"", it's with a 57 and a pre and no compressor. I generally prefer tube pres for guitars, my favorites being Thermionic Cultures's The Earlybird and my old Telefunken V76s.*

*For solid state pres, I love my Neve 1079s and the Chandler TG Channels. If the pre has a HighPass filter, I try to use it as aggressively as I can without killing the sound. But when in doubt, I leave a lot of low stuff in there until I mix.*

*If I do choose to use a compressor(arpeggio parts, etc.), I have three awesome compressors for guitars: 1. Innertube Audio's Atomic Squeeze Box 2. Pendulum Audio's 6386 3. Thermionic Culture's The* [*Phoenix*](https://www.gearslutz.com/board/gear.php?t=Phoenix)*. Generally slowish attacks, quick releases, low ratios and high thresholds.*

*Some times I'll use a second mic (usually a ribbon), but I'm actually not a very big fan of the Royer 121. I've never been able to make it sound that good. I love adding a good room mic when it's appropriate. It can help create a huge stereo spread... but a big mess if it's on too many parts.*

*All the strings on Boxer (as best as I can recall) are played by only two people: Padma (the sixth member of the band who also wrote most of the arrangements) on viola and violin and a guest player named Ha Yang Kim on cello. So we had to stack a lot of takes. Some takes were recorded with three mics (a* [*RCA 44*](https://www.gearslutz.com/board/gear.php?id=20643) *ribbon mic a few feet away/ a* [*U47*](https://www.gearslutz.com/board/gear.php?id=1389) *in omni about 6-8 feet away/ and a elam251 in omni about 20 feet away). Compression only on the distant mic. But with all the stacking of tracks, most passes were just one mic. In fact, most of the time it was the very distant mic that worked best in the mix.*

*Most of the string sounds were very full and rich, but that's not what you hear on the record. To make the strings fit sonically and stylistically, I really, really, really thinned and crapped them out. Some tracks were severely high-passed, and some were even AmpFarmed. The strings on ""Racing Like A Pro"" a basically destroyed by a plug-in on the string bus called Vinyl...absolutely no high end or low end, but that's what makes them so haunting. Generally not loads of reverb. If you only knew how much cool stuff got left off the album...oh well...that's the way it goes...*

**And from an intern at Peter's studio:** 

*""Hey, i actually worked as an intern on this album for 3 months at Tarquin Studios*  
*in Bridgeport, Connecticut. What an amazing opportunity. The amount of slutty gear*  
*that Peter Katis has blows my mind. And he knows how to use all of it. Which is even more impressive. As far as the vocal chain goes, I am pretty sure he was using a telefunken ela-M 251 mic through a vintage Neve pre amp...and I am not sure about the compressor I think it might have been the Chandler/EMI TG1. But yes, the final product was even better than I anticipated. I haven't stopped listening to it since it leaked, errr I mean came out.* 

*I also saw them live twice playing the material from the new album and it sounded fantastic at bowery ballroom in NY (the best part was, Peter Katis's indie rock band from the 90's The Philistines Jr. opened for them) and again in Montreal. It's been very interesting to watch from the outside how a song goes from it's bare bones stage, through all of the overdubs, and then removing overdubs, and then doing different overdubs, and then completely retracking the song and then hearing it mixed and mastered, and then hearing it live.*

*I actually spent a lot of my time miking the drums and getting good drums sounds. The drums were tracked to a Studer 24 track 2 inch tape machine and then imported into* [*Pro Tools*](https://www.gearslutz.com/board/gear.php?id=22163)*. Throughout the course of tracking the drums, we used quite a few different mic set ups. I don't remember which set ups went with which songs, but in general, I think a lot of the dark meaty sound came from the 1953 Neumann U-47 in front of the kit. I know we crossed a couple Coles in front of the kit, just above the U-47 for some of the tracks and even used a royer 121 as a room mic as well as leaving the ela-M 251 on as a room mic.

The problem is more about the transparency. Brunei has it so much and rich but we NEVER really know where the money goes to. 

There's a need to educate the higher ups and also the royalties on how to use the money to develop the country. I can't imagine, in a day how much millions they spent on unnecessary things. Look at the amount of cars, oversea shoppings and etc. Not only our country's management is poor but the culture here is holding us back. So many things are mixed up together w religions and conservative culture. 

Civilians paying subsidies won't help the country to move forward that much, it will only help the rich people to be more rich. 

It's not an easy solution as it involves the royal families, govt, culture and belief. Even if tax is imposed to improvise the country, I am not sure how well can the authority use it well. We might end up paying tax for nothing.

"dzhtkq8","So I'm going to compare wealthy professionals (not mega rich but net worth over £1m) and chronically unemployed poor British people here. I spend extensive time around both. Poor people are way sicker, even the ones who don't smoke or drink too much. Everyone here gets the same medical care on the NHS (though some who can afford to do go private) and everyone can buy cheap, healthy food anywhere if they choose to. We don't have food deserts here. Though as George Orwell noted in The Road To Wigan Pier - when you are poor, [you're much less likely to look forward to eating or inclined to cook a healthy nutritious meal of fish and green vegetables.] (https://blogs.spectator.co.uk/2013/08/george-orwells-lesson-for-jamie-oliver/)

It seems to me like even when you control things like healthcare and nutrition so that a good level of both are available to everyone, the sheer misery of being poor and low in social stature makes people more prone to illness, and they die much younger.

This isn't just my observation either. The Whitehall Study compared the health outcomes of British civil servants in the strict hierarchy of the civil service, lower ranking people took more sick leave, were fatter and had higher rates of mental illness. This is also seen in primate studies. [Here's an outstanding documentary] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYG0ZuTv5rs) for anyone interested.

TL;DR: Even if you're poor in a rich country where you can get medical care and you won't starve, you're still far more likely to die younger and have more illness in life.

**EDIT:** There are a lot of people making very good observations that this poor health is a result of stress and depression and asking whether poor health causes poverty or poverty causes poor health etc. It is for sure, but it's also because of *social stress* from being low in relative status. Work stress, obesity and addiction all add to the problem, but the negative effect of simply feeling like you are subordinate and at the bottom of the pile causes a chemical stress response in the body that over time damages your cardiovascular health and immune system etc. It even affects people who are not living in poverty, or even poor (no one in the Whitehall Study was poor.)

Snoke was a lowly nobody, born beyond the reach of the Jedi, and not interesting to the Sith. He had minor Force potential, but nothing significant. He used what little he had to influence people around him for his own gain, becoming rich but unsatisfied. With his wealth came freedom, however, and he used to it pursue his interest in the Force. Around this time, the Jedi fall and the Emperor rises to power. Snoke uses the chaos to abduct a Jedi Padawan fleeing the chaos, and try to learn the secrets of the Force from the Padawan. 

It doesn't work very well. His abilities aren't strong enough to break into the young Jedi's brain, so he tries to break the Padawan with conventional torture. It works, and Snoke learns that he simply has a low midichlorian count, and can never become the great Force user he wants to be. Unsatisfied and undeterred, Snoke sets about researching midichlorians. He eventually discovers a way to steal them from others, but it requires them to be vulnerable and to have lowered their defenses. In their conflict, their midichlorians are exposed and easy to take.

He uses it first on the Jedi he'd captured. He breaks the student, but doesn't press him enough to go dark. Only enough to make him conflicted. And in his moment of crisis, Snoke drains him completely. Snoke's body isn't meant to accommodate these new midichlorians, so he begins to deteriorate faster than normal. But his Force Power grows. The trouble for him is, he will die from deterioration eventually, if it's left unchecked. So he learns a way to drain his victims more slowly, which gives his body a chance to adapt. But it requires a victim in a near constant state of turmoil, with a very high midichlorian count. Which is when he begins preying on Ben Solo.

Do these supporters just...not believe the nonpartisan, basic mathematical analysis of this bill? What do they think is going on??

Either way, I'm already calling it: the same exact thing that happened to Obama, is going to happen to the next liberal president.

Fuck, he was torn apart for his ""decision"" to pull troops out of Iraq, despite that literally being already decided by Bush years earlier! He was blamed for so many issues during his term whose original creation was completely out of his control...like unemployment rate. *You think a president has control of that shit when he first takes office?*

Then Obama fucking fixed a lot of the shit and did his best to reright the ship...only to have Trump skate in and brag about the ship being upright, something that had already been set in motion, and honestly happened DESPITE his lumbering ass stumbling all over the deck. *Boasting about the low unemployment rate during your first 100 days, are you fucking kidding me?*

"dxeg909","Way back in high school, I belonged to a group of 7 friends who were kind of well off, sociable, popular for being pretty, and girly. They weren't exactly the ""Mean Girls"" type of group since they were kind to everyone.

Or so I thought.

I wasn't the pretty and girly one but I got myself into the group because of my academic excellence and extra-curricular activities. Basically, I was known in the entire school for that. However, I wasn't the rich one. I grew up in a poor middle-class family. Becoming excellent in what I do is my way of paying the efforts of my parents forward.

All throughout high school, every single student in campus liked our group because we have everything a person wants - money, power, intelligence, charisma.

I thought they were my true friends since I may not be pretty and rich but they allowed me to be part of their group.

Just like in any friendships, I invested time and effort to keep them well by helping them in whatever I can.

However, it was on the latter part of high school that I realized that they were only using me to further their campus popularity. They wouldn't invite me on their birthday celebrations because ""they don't want to disturb my academics"". They don't invite me to their summer getways because ""they're concerned of me"" for giving up attendance to conferences and trainings. But the truth is, they haven't even asked if I'm free on those dates coz they don't want me around. Period.

What the rest of the campus don't know is that behind the ideal girl group they all wish for, I would allow them to give a hint on, if not allow them to copy, my homework. Basically, they basked on my intelligence, power (being the teacher's fave) and charisma (being other students' inspiration).

Colleged entered and we parted ways. I got into our country's top university and aced on those early sems. They started to invite me on our group meetups. I thought, maybe they changed and matured? Enjoyed their company for a while but then I realized that was just a notch higher to using me again. Discovered they liked some of my guy school mates who were really popular for being handsome and smart in other high schools and they want to use me to get to know them better.

It was when I said, ""fuck this shit. I will not allow these fake friends to use me again.""

I really considered them my friends until I realized that friendships were supposed to be mutually beneficial, not for one party's selfish interests.

Fortunately, I met the most genuine, non-pretentions, helpful and selfless kind of people in college. Now I call them not just my classmates, but also my friends!

That was 4 years ago and I'm just glad I made a bold yet satisfying risk of burning bridges!

Of course, both the rich and poor pay much less in tax than in most of continental europe. In the end, UK needs to stop thinking it can have Germanic/Scandinavian welfare on what is PseodoAmerican tax levels... Base rate increases is the only thing that will work, once the base rate has increased, then one can talk about increasing the top rate perhaps. 

UK also has a super high tax free allowance in comparison to most other countries.

&gt;Sorry but I don't believe I am. Working class people are the band of people that contribute and feel the effects of tax hikes. They are not wealthy (compared to the super rich) but a hike in inheritance tax for example would see a substantial amount of their overall wealth taken away that they worked a lifetime for which should be passed onto future generations. If we are talking tens of millions of £'s then you have a point. However the majority of baby boomers in this country have less than £750k in assets to be passed onto numerous children. Not much when compared to average house prices and when divided.

You fallen victim to thinking that £750k isn't a huge fortune, and that it isn't something which is massively based around luck, which is something taxes (inheritance) should attempt to correct. Remember that there also are a large amount of people who doesn't have this huge amount of wealth, and that if we keep protecting housing wealth society will increasingly be decided between ""have house"" and ""does not have house"". 

&gt;That is not fixing the actual issue though, is it? The actual problem is ridiculously high house pricing because development hasn't met demand for over two decades. If the cost of housing wasn't so high then there would be less reliance on needing inheritance to afford a home.

By having more money available for house purchases, (and more credit), house prices can be increased more than if there was less money available. If there was less inheritance money available to be used for deposits, it's likely house prices wouldn't have increased as much.

"dw7fb5d","If you don't mind having bacon chunks in the soup, go ahead and just leave em in the pan when you add your aromatics and sweat everything on fairly low/medium heat, the main thing is that you want to cook them until they're crispy and the fat has rendered out, which takes some patience. Bacon and lardons have a lot of fat in them and become crispy once cooked down so you won't have gummy pieces of bacon. If you dont want them in there you have the right of it, render out the fat and take em out before adding aromatics.

Leaving them in will make the soup more hearty and rich, but not smooth so you may want to just not put the bacon back in.

As for the stock, the key ingredient for stock is time. Most restaurants roll their stock over night on super low heat, so you want a good handful of hours to cook the stock or even overnight if you can manage it in your kitchen. The main reason homemade stock typically seems watery is simply not enough time. I personally would also roast the hocks and shanks for extra color and richness in the stock. Don't forget to add lots of aromatics to the stock too.

"dw7e2ng","I do agree it depends on the course. And I think some of the reasons are not directly connected to increased international intake (e.g. casualisation, demoralisation of teaching staff, etc). But I guess in my experience particularly with students on say Master of Public Relations type courses, I have seen some shocking assignments being given As and very little in the way of consequences for students who don't contribute to group work. I also find the teaching I've experienced somewhat lacking in intellectual rigour and providing enough of a challenge for students. Maybe the latter can't be blamed entirely on international students but I do feel that there isn't enough pressure for courses to meet higher academic standards, and relying on international students allows unis to get away with it - if they put off high-achieving students they can just attract more rich but middling students.

Also, i don't think academic entry barriers are *that* high for international students. Where I'm from, a lot of people who can't make it to local unis will pick Australia, often through reticulation from local tafe equivalents (not nearly as common with US/UK unis, and even then often private unis). 
Actually, I sorta failed high school (for other reasons) and didn't qualify for a local uni myself, but was accepted to a Go8 arts programme after being initially denied...


You make a good point about very good unis being well-funded, which implies private funding, but I don't know if the converse is true (that good private funding = good uni), not if administrators siphon off most of the income (which is again not directly tied to the issue at hand, though it certainly favours admin over teaching and research quality). 

I want to wave around my idealistic flag and believe that the government can actually allocate enough funding to relieve reliance on international students - and make trade apprenticeships a more attractive option. But you are right about the lack of willingness to do so...

"dw781rs","Hey guys. Glad to see this place finally came about. Been waiting for it. Anyways... so far ive bough maybe 8 calls? All of them very tiny and at least 6 of them are dead or at like -80%, mostly because I had no idea what I was doing and also because well the market went to hell this week. They were all tiny positions and I’m probably down $100 so far. Which is fine. I did have some early success which leads in my actual (first of many) questions. I  had two 3/16 $60 MU calls pay off and an $SPY. That’s it. im still up about $200 over all. Thanks to the $MU calls which went from -46% to +1500% literally overnight.  
This was the 13th, so I immediately sold one of $MU [calls](https://imgur.com/gallery/iV7yT) profit of $350. and the other I hung on to. That one I ended up selling the next day, the 14th, for [profit of $88](https://imgur.com/gallery/VUXpD).Then the next day MU closed above $60 for the first time in 17 years.  
Obviously I got extremely lucky because I basically bought all these as a way to gamble with like $15 and maybe learn something. Which despite the gains I consider a major failure because I learned nothing except that options are extremely crazily volitile. I have a ton of questions but to start with the basic noob questions: I sold the first $MU call when MU was trading at approx $63. If I had hung onto it and let it expire, “in the money”, would I have made more money even though the stock price, was lower when it closed “in the money”, then the price I sold it at?  
I’ve got a ton of questions and I realize this is a pretty basic one, so I’m hoping somebody will be patient and help me out.   
Also I realize that even buying those $60 calls was EXTREMLY risky/stupid. I do want to actually learn how to utilize options in a Serious way not for YOLO/get rich but actually poor manner. I just did those two in order to get over my initial fear of trading options.  
One more: am I correct in believing that Call loses will simple stop when the value reaches $0?

"dvm7vwg","Asian-born Asian here (went to college in the US, now living in EU), came across [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianMasculinity/comments/7zxwfc/asian_cultural_enlightenment_thread_part_1_hong/dus8ylq/) on the different education-dependent classes in Hong Kong and I feel it's an interesting phenomenon that's fairly prevalent in Asia but not often discussed. 

The divide between ""studied locally all the way thru university"" and ""local high school, university abroad"" is very prominent in the part of Asia where I'm from. Those with foreign (i.e. Western countries) degrees are heavily favored in employment with long-term impacts. Study abroad guys and girls generally get paid more from the get-go, tend to be promoted faster and there's a higher ceiling on how high up you can go in position/status/salary versus local graduates.

It's interesting how that seems unfair at first, until you realize there's a definite mindset difference that goes deeper into every day life than just work. Those who studied abroad tend to be more creative, open-minded, outspoken and tend to have better English (last one varies, I know people who spent 4-8 years in the US/UK and return with still shit-levels of English and barely have any vocab).

From personal experience and stories from friends, it's difficult being a study abroad graduate trying to date or even get along as friends with those who have barely/never lived out of Asia their entire lives. The latter group stereotypically complains about everything without actually doing anything about the situation (e.g. staying at a shitty job for years, complaining about it and when advice comes to make a jump, they get all doom and gloom that ""all jobs are just as terrible/bad paying"") and conversations are generally very boring.

While financials do play a part in whether people study abroad or locally, it's weird that it's not the only factor. You have lower-middle or lower class people busting their asses to get scholarships, loans, their families pooling savings, or a combo to go get that sought-after Western degree. And you also have families that are stankin' rich (talking about millions of US dollars in property, savings, cars) whose kids choose to study locally - resulting in very rich but uncultured dumb-dumbs.

The resulting dating market is rather chaotic due to the permutations in class (education/mentality vs financial status). Things that were near unimaginable (e.g. yellow female, brown/dark-skin male) in our parents' generation are now pretty common - money is important but people 'click' better due to similar mentality and experiences (study abroad) and don't wanna date ""down"" in terms of education.

Till We Have Faces is fascinating in about a dozen different ways. It was one of the first books Lewis ever began, and it was one of the final to be published.

It's extremely heavy material, highly intellectual, and thematically rich. But then you read the second half. This was written after Lewis became a Christian, and well after his many years in apologetics. And the second half is his own answer to the first half, in which he looks back on his own life and answers the complaints of his own younger self (of course, all through the conceit of this Greek myth). It's brilliant. It's absolutely brilliant. And the final few pages have some of the most theologically rich and eloquent phrases that you'll ever come across, ever.

But this “consumerism” comment is insightful—this is more probably the ‘monoculture’ that the West brings, and that the East and Africa increasingly join. The spiritual void that some Western philosophers have started to comment on—materially rich, but spiritually poor.

I would also draw attention to another comment regarding the Western fascination and need to criticise Islam—the same people who see prayer and hijab as oppression are often unaware of the trillions of dollars spent on control through marketing. Are we Westerners more or less free that it’s unacceptable for us to wear hijab? Are we more or less free when for both men and women, increasingly our value is tied to our sex and body and that this should be shown in public?

The confusion of all three leading to sensational articles where they interview subcultures in Japan that are far from the norm that can't tell the difference between high contraceptives and low rate of sex. Of course in Japan no one is fucking the otaku 'freak' (that's how people see them) that spends all her income on anime. And then there's always the school in some rural area that has fewer and fewer students without mentioning that it's because more than half of Japans 150 million people live in the heavily urbanized Kansai region or greater Tokyo area and have always been moving out of the countryside.

What Japan has is rising fertility rates and lower population growth. They're hypersexualized but have super high contraception.

I want to see this guy go through the pros and cons of what decisions he has to make, and how he sets it up, and how he protects himself with sensible choices. Will he give money away? To his friends and family? Will he even tell his own family members he won? How many of his friends turn out to just want money? How does he find out what lawyer to use? How does he know who to trust? How does he find and put together his ""team""? How do those conversations go? What options are there? I want know the minutiae of winning the lottery through the eyes of a fictional character in a current situation like myself, with no connections or savvy or know-how to do everything himself. 

He's probably going to have to hide it. How? How do you use a trust? How do you collect the prize anonymously? How do you hide the money from peoplelooking for handouts? From your own family? How exactly? What about his job? Does he just up and quit one day? Burn bridges or not? What reasons does he give? Especially to the inevitable people who figure out he has money?

And then later, he's going to invest in stuff. How does he do that too? I don't want to see him walk into a building and then back out in the next shot, having completed mysterious and complicated business there, I want to know how things are done like I'm the one doing it.

And then he's going to buy stuff. I don't just mean ""panda express every night"" or whatever, I want to see how he chooses the house, car, plane, boat, or whatever big item he gets. I want to see the details on why those are good or bad choices, and the things you have to live with, Like am I going to have to hire staff for this and that? Me, I want to get a flying car. I want to get a missile silo or bunker. I want to have secret tunnels and hideouts. I went nobody else to know about it. And I want a private cabin on a lake in the mountains that maybe a few people are allowed to visit. Maybe he gets a private island, who do you go to for that?

And what resources do the rich have? Does he get a ""family office""? How does that work? I want the best possible computer and internet connection. Is there anything better than fiber? How would he get this information, because I don't know. Does he get a personal assistant after a while? Where do you get those, and how much do I pay him? Health insurance? Umbrella insurance? What are all the insurances I'll need?

And then he's going to be given access to things. He's going to get to meet all kinds of other rich people, if he wants. What will that be like? Will he meet senators and presidents and other heads of state? Actors and ceos and Buffett and gates and Bezos? How will he approach his problems? What if someone is kidnapped for ransom? What if someone tries to blackmail him? What problems will being rich give him? Will he regret it?

What would be rather do? How does he start charities or startups or donate? What are the tax penalties and burdens and etc?

"dtm526m","Multi-level marketing is a perfectly valid marketing strategy, as long as there are enough real services or good being sold to sustain it.  That isn't really what people talk about when they talk about a pyramid scheme.  The basic of a pyramid scheme is the recruitment fee.  You pay a fee when you join, and you recruit others who pay you a fee, and you pass along a percentage of that fee to the one recruited you, who passes along a percentage to the one who recruited them, etc.  In the end, a few get rich, but most never recruit enough to make back their money.  

Pyramid schemes often disguise themselves as multi-level marketing systems, by pretending to really be based on some product or service, and hide the recruitment fee as training costs, or setup costs, or some such.  Really shitty or failed multi-level marketing systems sometimes end up pretty much a pyramid scheme.

Yes, bitcoin is something a little different.  It is closer to a Ponzi scheme. But it still isn't even that. But what all these have in common, including bitcoin, is they shift money around in a way to make it look like everyone is going to get rich, however there is no real value getting created, but instead just money moving around, so is always going to end up a zero-sum game.

I looked up, and what appeared to be a homeless man was standing across the street from the bar, staring at me through the windows. It sounds creepy, but for some reason I wasn’t scared of him at all, and we locked eyes. He started walking towards the bar and we kind of stayed staring at each other. We kept our gaze as he walked into the bar and walked right up to me. My friend was kinda like “uh...you know this guy?”. He didn’t say a word. He just put his palm out and I instinctively put my palm on his. He ran his pointer finger up and down my palm and looked at it intently. He finally spoke and said “ You have a lot of anxiety about your future, but it’s going to be alright. You won’t be rich, but you’ll be comfortable. You’re going to have 2 kids and you won’t be in Boston, but you’ll still be close enough to your family. I know that’s important to you.

"drhtbwz","I tried to wrap my head around this concept and determine why merely the phrase “white privilege” is a trigger. So I went to Wikipedia. An I think that was worse. 

I may be misquoting. But, supposedly the original description to explain the concept was to think like every white person carries around an invisible backpack.  They are not even AWARE of this backpack. It’s just there.  Then when an issue arises (let’s say traffic stop) a “white privilege” card is pulled out of the backpack and exchanged. Thereby making the interaction easier.  ( not shot, given a written warning, whatever). And then white person goes about his day without ever knowing about his privilege. 

So, the thing that bothers me about this is if I don’t KNOW about this “magic backpack” how am I supposed to ditch it?  There is nothing I can do to change the color of my skin either. 

It seems like a lot of people that bring up this concept are trying to shame white people because of it. But, I think for some white people  it just angers them because as you stated “I worked for everything I ever got”. 

I get the concept I just think it need a less decisive term as when poor people hear the word “privilege” they assume it’s something only the rich have access to.  I mean, not every white person is rich, but most don’t have to deal with the additional scrutiny other races get from the system. 

To clarify More Traffic stops, frisking, assumed guilt. Etc.  does exist I don’t deny it.  Just think the term to describe it could be more nuanced.

"do2yc59","That's easy to say but not always true in practice. My gf is an only child and grew up pretty wealthy; both her parents have made a combined 200-300k+ salary for most of her life. They lived in a 5,000 sf house and had nice cars and she never had to worry about not having something she wanted. 

I didn't grow up poor or anything, but my dad made between 40-50k and my mom was a teacher's aid making like 17k. Living in the D.C. area and having three kids, that money doesn't go as far as it would most places, and when my dad got laid off things got really tight as they had to use credit cards to pay bills and rent for a few years while he tried to find another job. We ate ramen and peanut butter sandwiches often and ate as cheaply as possible. 

Guess who had a happier childhood? My house was small and I had to share a shower with 4 other people, and I didn't get the latest toys or nicest clothes, but I had two sisters to play with and a mom who was home in the summer to spend time with me and take me to the pool, and home at 4 everyday to make dinner for me. I spent a ton of time playing soccer, football, and basketball, or exploring in the woods with my friends who lived on my block or close by in my neighborhood (small townhouses). There were definitely times where our financial situation caused stress/anger for my parents, but for me and my sisters we were too busy being kids to be bothered with that. I had friends who had more money than me, but others who had it even worse and so we learned to be thankful for what we did have. 

My gf on the other hand, had no siblings to spend time with and parents who worked long hours who were hardly home. Her mom pretty much never cooked dinner/ate with her so she'd have to order something for herself. Her dad and her had a great relationship, but he traveled a lot, and even when her mom was around, she had mental/anger issues and wasn't really fit to be a mom. She didn't have many friends in the neighborhood to play with because all the houses were so large and far apart, and not that many kids were within walking distance. 

She's overall pretty well adjusted and happy/successful now, but she still goes to therapy to deal with depression/anxiety because of how her mom treated her growing up and her depression has gotten really bad in the past.

"dnl2wny","I worked in a service department for a year that was mostly residential. The work wasn't the bad part to me. Sure some jobs would require a crawl or attic but those don't bug me too much. I actually found it fun trying to figure out how to fish wires while making as few holes in the drywall that I could. I really love the problem solving aspect of it.

My least favorite part was dealing with the customers. A lot of them were fine but there was a lot of customers that were impossible to make happy. I would show up to a house and upgrade their service or something for a day or two. Everything goes fine, the customer is happy with the new service. Then I hand them the the bill and they are unhappy even though I was upfront about how much it would be from the beginning. Some people just don't think our time is worth what it is and that really ruined it for me.

Other things that added a lot of stress were: Lots of driving time. We had a job estimator who was a complete idiot for awhile. Working for slumlords who are filthy rich but unimaginatively cheap. 
The added responsibilities of managing my own schedule, inspections, contacting clients, ordering material... etc.

Overall I had a bad time. But keep in mind the company you have this opportunity may be different. Maybe their service department is ran better.

"dn2uvul","I'll never forget the first time I had a lucid dream that I didn't immediately wake up from. It started out as a normal, boring dream. The first scene is familiar. I'm at the gymnasium of one of my previous schools. There was a lock in that a lot of students were taking part in. I remember holding a sleeping bag and looking for a spot to get comfortable. I remember talking to a few students. One person was rude, another didn't really care I was there, but I ended up sitting down next to someone and having a good conversation with them. I remember getting nice and comfortable in my sleeping bag and suddenly...


I'm not there anymore. I'm standing in a hallway of the school and nobody is around. I was enjoying myself and I wanted to go back so I walked over to these cherry red payphones. I then picked up the handset and put it up to my ear, then replaced it.  I was thinking that I would teleport back with everyone else if I went to the correct payphone (kind of like in the Matrix movie) On the third or fourth payphone I realized how ridiculous I was being.. and it hit me. *I am dreaming!*


I am no longer at the school... I find myself in another hallway. The walls are plane and white with some brown rim work near the bottom. The floor is white and polished. The ceiling is grayish. I don't remember seeing any lights on the ceiling, but the hallway seems dimly lit with white fluorescent. I feel like I'm in a hospital's hallway, but there are no doors on either side of me.

It wasn't the most ideal place I wanted to be so I remember thinking *I want to visit my friend* Then I said ""Take me to my friend's house."" and tried mentally picturing my friend and his house.  The sound of my voice surprised me. It was vibrant and rich, but my own. It had that 'voice of god' sound effect quality, but at the same time it was mine. That is the  best way I can describe it. The weird thing is, the tone of my thinking voice was exactly the same when I spoke in the dream.

Still, there I find myself standing. So I shrugged and decided to follow the hallway. The walls were pretty plain. Eventually I came to this mirror. It's border was bronze and the mirror kind of looked like a sun. I was interested in how the mirror would work, or how I would look like so I looked directly into it. There I saw it! Eh, nothing fancy... Even though I was looking directly into it, my reflection was at an angle. Like I only saw the top half of my head at the corner of the mirror.   *Huh... so that's what they mean by things not working properly* and so I walked off, satisfied.

---

I then passed two elevators. The doors were silver and looked normal enough. I think I remember there was a potted plant nearby. The arrow buttons were not lit. So I pressed the button and- *Nope. Nope. Nope.* I hate elevators and I wasn't about to jump into my dream ones.  Fuck the button. I didn't press that shit Fuck the plant.  I decided to check out this text on the nearby wall. It looked to be written in black marker at a slant and it that said ""Don't forget to talk to Kim"" I remember thinking *Who the hell is Kim? I don't know a kim* ""Man fuck this cryptic non sense I got other stuff to."" So I went on my way leaving the text and elevators behind me.

So I'm toddling along hunky dory down the hallway and  I realize ""Wait a second- why am I just walking?"" and in a instant I'm now a wolf running on all fours. Happened so fast just I'm walking than bam I'm a wolf and running. I remember the clicks of claws against the floor and the white paint zooming past. I kept swapping from wolf on all 4's to a werewolf form running on 2's. 

I'm not sure how long I ran. Eventually I reached a dead end. Now the dead end wall was out of place of the hospital setting. Like it was a blueish black marble wall. I remember putting my hand up against it and it was cold to the touch. *huh* In past dreams I've accidently went through doors/walls so I decided to push up against it to try to walk through it. No dice. After a few pushes and mental imagining of myself going through the wall, I gave up on it and decided to try to make a door. So I thought about a door being there. Nothing happened. I decided to should ""Door!"" NoThInG. 

At this point.... I was getting a little pissed. This was my lucid dream. I couldn't go to my friend's house. I couldn't bring my friend here. I couldn't walk through the wall and now this door thing isn't working out. I remember feeling irritated and pointing at the wall and mentally shouting *DOOR!!!* and thinking as hard as I could about a door. Like magic... a door slowly started to appear.  It phased in like something out of Star Trek, but with less sparkles. Oh man, was that a good feeling.


---

It was tall and dark brown.  I walked over and opened the door inward. I remember seeing the inside of a large building. There were people walking around pushing carts. Another one of those instant thoughts/actions happened. I had the feeling this was a large store like Costco. I also rremembered that I was still a werewolf, so I slammed the door shut, not wanting to start a panic or scare any kids that I saw.

I waited a minute and decided to open the door again. This time, on the other side of the door I remembered seeing what looked like to be an inside of a cabin. I could hear the sound of running water and decidied to go in and check things out.  The walls were indeed circular and brown and the room was big. Throughout the room I saw several pools. Some where above ground made out of large carved boulders. Others were underground pools, decorated with stones, pebbles, water lilies, reeds, like a pond. I guessed that it was some kind of nature themed pool store inside a log cabin. I remember seeing  two fountains shooting water to each other across the room.

Seeing all the pools was really cool. I decided to have  a little fun. I jumped up and over the large boulder and splashed into the pool. I remember the water was perfectly warm as it soaked into my fur. It was big enough that I could paddle around, or stand up in. I remember standing up on the side of the boulder and jumping into another pool and just having a good ole time splashing everything and enjoying myself in the water.


---

I eventually got out and headed back to the door, but saw another room. I opened that door and peeked inside, to find a single pool of water and some windows. Well, I had to jump into that pool too. I remember looking up at the windows that was near the ceiling to let light in and it was daylight. I saw the tops green trees and it looked like the log cabin was in the mountains. There was another set of windows on the other wall that was waist high, with a window chair to sit on.

I climbed out of the pool and dripped my way over to the window seats to look out the window. There was some sort of patio with people standing around. It looked like they were having a cookout. I remember i could see a glare of my reflection too. Wolf face, black fur, nothing too fancy. Everyone looked like they were enjoying themselves, it was normal and serene. I remember hearing through the glass ""Hey, there's a wolf in the house!"" from one of the woman. Their friend laughed and told them to stop joking.  I remember pressing my nose against the glass and grinning as I looked back. A couple of other people stopped talking and looked up at me. Before anyone else could react I jumped up and ran back for my door, laughing all the way back to my door, opening and slamming it shut behind me.  It was especially humorous to imagine their confusion when they found the floors soaked and wet wolf tracks in the floor leading up to the wall ( I believed my door disappeared from their house after I shut it behind me).  

I was back at the hospital hallway, still laughing about the good time I have. The feeling... just fantastic. Pure bliss. I would have continued my escapades and explored and experimented more with the door, but unfortunately I woke up with the sound of my own laughter still ringing in my ears.

I groggily wrote down all the details. I still have the journal somewhere at my house. Couldn't believe what happened and I hoped to get back to sleep to continue the story, but  I had to leave for work that day. Whenever I think about lucid dreaming I think back to this dream. I've not had another clear lucid dream like it since.

"dmttbx9","D&amp;D-based setting, centered on ""Kilain"", 'The City of Four Kings'. Kind of a problem that I don't play D&amp;D for this.

Theme of the setting is that it's the age of enlightenment- less technologically (guns aren't that interesting in a setting for this purpose, I don't think. At least primitive guns really aren't) and more culturally- the scientific method is a few generations old, and the setting has entered a new golden age of science and learning- chemistry, physics, political philosophy, and, most controversial of all, arcane magic. Magic is no longer the exclusive domain of priesthoods, druods, and sorcerers with inborn, gods-given gifts, and that raises a lot of questions.

This is a time of political and societal turmoil, but also of advancement, learning, discovery, and societal shift, as the foundations of how people see the world shift, and even the Gods, distant and unable to speak with or manifest on the world, in contrast to the D&amp;D standard, are being brought into question, as common folk seem to move further away from their priesthoods and temples every year.

The primary location is Kilain, the City of 4 Kings, a massive, sprawlings metropolis at the crossroads of everything, richest city in the known world, and highly classical City of Adventure.

The setting they're in the center of involes a large coastal mountain range (ocean to the west) besides a vast, hot but liveable valley of fertile, volcanic soil, with a high mountainted range of Harsh Granite beyond providing the setting's Eastern boarder. The Valley is divided into petty fiefdoms, mostly human in population, but also with significant minorities of ""Sky Dwarves"", and ""Sun Elves"", elf and dwarf ethnic groups. The first are basically Glaswegian Hobbits, the different kinds of elves I'm still figuring out to some extent.

The Valley Kingdoms sit between Fortified Orc Tribes in the Eastern Mountains (Mostly nice enough chaps, just territorial. They call themselves the Bear Tribes for a reason.), and the Steel Dwarves in the Coastal Range, more classical ""King-in-the-mountains"" type Dwarves, renowned for smiting and craftsmanship, with most of their agriculture (terrace farms yo) and defenses on the surface, with commerce and homes in the mountain tunnels. Neither groups is exclusive to either range- steel dwarves in the East, Bear tribes on the coast, there are some of each, but both are territorial enough that they never share a mountain or anything like that.

Further West, there are several Archipelagoes, whose populations also litter the coastlines at the foot of the mountains- Serpent Orcs, who are basically vikings with less furs and small tusks, Oxen Orcs, who are more chill fishermen and agriculteralists out on the islands, and both a human population (no human ethnic groups are named yet) and the ""Ivory Dwarves"", who are seafarers and traders, operating out of cities on the isles, most with a very Venice canal-city aesthetic.

At the center of this, on the West edge of the valley, is Lake Kilain, a massive body of water, comparable to San Francisco Bay, but a freshwater lake, that drains through a lush, rich, but fairly narrow river valley through the Coastal Mountains, a valley that, from sea to lakeshore, is covered every inch by the city of Kilain, about a 2-mile stretch, lengthwise. It was founded originally by the Steel Dwarves, who still stretch the city North to Mt. Gora, it's southern slope awash in cluttered cityscape, some of whom still call it ""Gora-Tassen"", or ""Gora's Foothills"".

The second King to come here, after the Steel King of the Dwarves, was the River King- then just another petty Lord of the Valley, the line of River Kings founded Kilain as we know it on the banks of Lake Kilain, to trade with the dwarves in the mountains and from the coast. Wealth and power made this seat the most powerful of the Valley Lords, and though none owe the so-called River King true fealty outside of their city, the Valley Lords have united three times in there history against common foes, and each time they turned to the Line of the River Kings to lead them.

The 3rd monarch came not from the West or the South, but from below- The ""Moon Elves"" (more neutral-leaning Drow) of the Underway came to Kilain from below, and it back me a hub of trade between the underway and the surface as well, until the Mistress (matriarchy, because Drow) of the Kilain Undercity became a powerful queen among the underways, presiding over Moon Elves, Stone Dwarves (Just Dwarves that live deep underground instead of high up in mountains) alike in her territories, sprawling far and wide beneath the surface.

The final King is the Serpent King- who came to Kilain when it was already great with dreams of plunder, but instead realized that he and his heirs might grow richer and fatter ruling part of the city than they ever would sacking it (also Vikings aren't great at sacking fortified mountains or underground tunnels. That was a factor.)

So all four races have a king, and basically every ethnicity in the setting can be found all through out the city (even the couple of Orc Tribes and The ""Star Elves"" I didn't mention), and all 4 power bases and the nobles around them are constantly vying for political power, coin, and influence. In addition, the current River King is, like, 12, and the Lord Regent is his Bastard Half-Elf Half-brother, who didn't know he was bastard son of the Previous King until the previous Regent, the boys' Uncle, tried to have all the royal Bastards killed. Current regent (who needs a name), was then a young rising star in the thieves' guild, which promptly went to war with the crown for him. Now they're basically an extension of the crown's forces under the Regent's command.

"dmcchr5","I’d left Jaded a few weeks before the eviction due to leadership inactivity which had left the corp feeling a bit rudderless. This was **EXACTLY** what I thought would happen and that’s why I left… so in fairness I can’t blame MCAV for taking this opportunity. In that respect, hats off to you guys. 

I’m sure there’s quite a few other WH corps kicking themselves that they didn’t spot the loot piñata first. At least they *would be* kicking themselves if they knew how much loot you guys carted out of there. Having said that, there are a couple things in this write up that need responding to. Firstly, about Jaded not taking fights. 

The MOTD you posted *still* seems sensible to me. Basically it says, don’t warp blindly into a blob. I mean, *who* does that in eve? You guys went as far as to embed a spy to be sure you could take the fight. How is that different?

When I joined we would take fights regularly. At that time we had active leadership who were frankly quite exacting about people having the doctrine ships. Back then we would have spot checks on the undocks for all the different doctrines and those that didn’t have the right ships or the right fits would have to explain to everyone on comms why they didn’t. At that time we regularly had the numbers to take fights and often did… except from MCAV!

Yeah guys: We avoided **you guys** specifically while taking fights from others because of your attitude. I was actually a bit sceptical the first time the FC said “It’s MCAV. We don’t give them content,” thinking it was a bit of an over-reaction… until, as if on cue, you guys started shit talking in local like 13 year olds on X-Box! I did figure it was personal to some degree and it was clear the well had been poisoned long before I got there. I didn’t know much about any interactions the corps had prior to me joining but it was really over the top. And it happened too often to have been “just a few bad apples”. At least one time it went on for like 30 minutes. I really wish I kept screenshots. Suffice to say every time we came across MCAV the attitude on display reinforced everyone’s determination not to give them any content even if we thought we might win the fight. 

When I first joined Jaded it was made very clear that we never shit talk in local. **Ever!** Always *gf* after a fight, win or lose. Being salty, even after getting ganked, was generally frowned upon and ridiculed. So the contrast when I first saw MCAV do it was stark. No one I knew in Jaded would have ever even considered doxing to be an appropriate response to an eviction. Not a single person. I can say with confidence no one ever even considered it. The fact you feel the need to thank Jaded for not doxing, basically for not being assholes, says more about you than it does about them frankly. There’s a reason you don’t thank everyone for not farting every time you get off a lift ie you don’t have to thank people for not being assholes.

Then again, in your own words:

&gt; This is a game and i find it completely ok to treat each other like complete garbage…

Well, Jaded didn’t. And the fact that you did was why we chose not to fight you.

I will admit that as the corp started bleeding leadership and members (deserves a whole different thread as to why I think that happened) we started taking fewer and fewer fights. Then one of the main FCs left and things just fell off a cliff. By the end I will admit, it was true Jaded did not have the numbers to maintain active PVP. But to re-iterate we had been avoiding interacting with MCAV for a while before that. 

This is getting a bit longer than I had intended but let me say quickly about the 200M a month rent, I was happy to pay it when I was a member and even suggested a couple times that it may be too low. Taxes mean that only people who PVE fund the corp. 200 mil is not hard to make in WHs if your active. The key word being active! Plus **all** taxes were set to zero. When we were still active and had regular C5 fleets I could have easily afforded to pay double what they were asking. 

Whatever you think of Jaded I think charging rent actually made a lot of sense and seemed to work really well when the corp was mostly active. For any CEOs who may consider the zero tax + rent model, I can say it sounded high when I joined but after getting the 1st month rent free it never felt unreasonable to pay it and I never struggled to afford it.

Now, having said all that, it is indeed cruel irony that Jaded ended up being evicted by MCAV. But that’s Eve. I really can’t fault you guys on the eviction. I saw it coming and if it wasn’t MCAV, someone else could easily have figured out that Jaded was asset rich but largely inactive. So fair play and good catch. But would I join MCAV after what I’d seen? Erm.. no. You guys are a bit too mouth-trumpety for me.

They will not turn on each other. Even if one throws a punch and it knocks the other down. Dude will get back up and go back to pummeling me with the other competitor.

It's frustrating, but if you can overcome it, it definitely becomes thrilling. Lol.

And I actually have to say that I love all the realism and the rollout function. I believe it makes the multi man matches more dynamic.

I totally understand why you don't like it. For me, it can really add to the stories I have in my head.

I downloaded a pretty sweet Conor McGregor CAW and had him win the Cruiserweight Title. Both through sims, and playing matches, he went undefeated for a year.

Then there was a triple threat between him, a Jushin Liger CAW, and Sami Zayn.

They ganged THE FUCK UP on me. I was destroying them, until Zayn went sorta heel and took me out with a chair.

I rolled out of the ring. Liger hit the Brainbuster on Zayn and scored the victory, thus ending McGregor's year+ long reign with the belt. But McGregor was never pinned.

Of course, this had no greater implications because Universe Mode isn't very dynamic or feature rich... But boy was it entertaining once I was able to remove myself from the upset of ""I wanted this character to remain undefeated.""

And it was cool to know that my character lost, but wasn't pinned. It was also cool that Zayn resorted to a chair shot to even the match. It was the only weapon used in the match.

Now, I just wish this rich and interesting sort of scenario were less of a haphazard threadbare experience I can project onto, and more of something 2K actually intends to happen.

How cool is it that the NPCs ""realized"" they couldn't beat me, so ganged up on me to get me out of the ring. Now, I think I'm projecting there... but that would be so rad if that were the case.

Doesn't counter anything i have mentioned.  
Germany had a separate front open in the War. And it fell in the end. 

&gt; That question is moot when your argument is that ""Rich countries don't like adversity, they will riot and the leaders will capitulate.""

How is it moot.  
Monaco is super rich but its tiny. Will it dare to have a to the last man fight against France?  
It won't because it knows what its capable of outside of being rich.  

Germany was a major power of that era. The power gap it had to others is not the same as Taiwan has(will have) with China.  

This isn't moot because when the concept of choice is introduced you have to take into account all vectors.

Rich and massive power disparity, very high odds of the smaller player capitulating.

Fairly wealthy ain't enough(and actually their economy in 80's 90's was not good). And i didn't bring Iraq into the discussion. And i don't get how it even got a mention in the first case. Iraq was a basket case, It was engaged in a long Iran-Iraq war, then attacked Kuwait, was pursuing WMD's. It was a erratic state and barely held together by a dictator.   
Taiwan has none of these factors.  

&gt; They're making open threats of war.

Media is not the Country. And no not all Chinese media speaks for the State.  

&gt; Going against their supposed doctribe of ""Always leave space open for your opponent, cornering them makes them tougher.""

It literally doesn't. The incident in no way shape or form did that. India as explained has tremendous tactical room to operate. Its not cornered at all. If anything its Bhutan which is being squeezed but that doesn't mean it has 0 choices left either.  

&gt; India has a treaty obligation to come to Bhutan's defence

If you mean the Friendship Treaty, then read it again please because it is so vague that it says basically nothing. India could come to Bhutan's aid BUT its about the same if it didn't.  

If you are talking about some other treaty with much clear language, i am all ears.  

&gt; This is not the Philippines we're talking about.

Not sure what this means because US actually has a defense pact which uses the word help in case of threat/attack on each other. 
And despite this 2012 Scarborough Shoal happened. And the reason was because SCS is disputed.  
Same with what is happening on the Bhutan border. EVEN IF there is a defense pact with Bhutan, India is well within its rights to not intervene because the border isn't Ratified, its in dispute and its not India's dispute hence India has tactical flexibility.  

&gt; The alternative would be allowing Bhutan to move into the Chinese sphere of influence, putting Sikkim, the entire North East, and more importantly, Indian credibility at stake.

That is highly presumptions with no basis. 

Bhutan has no diplomatic relations with any UNSC members. It is basically a Indian protectorate. Its the country India has to least worry about.  
And China isn't going to annex Bhutan. They are pushing for a land border based on a treaty which justifies it, unless that changes i don't see any problem.  

&gt; India has ""India had tremendous tactical flexibility in all this"" only of a meek surrender is a viable alternative. I don't think that is the case here.

Semantics can be twisted anyway. India reacted first, it choose to go into Bhutanese/Chinese territory. I won't use the words meek at all, but it is what is it, you take a action be prepared to face the consequences.  

&gt; It's funny that only treaty documents that favour China are ""important"" while those that don't can be easily discarded for garbage. Like the 1914 Simla Accord or more recently, the Sino-British Joint Declaration on Hong Kong

What is this. 

I expect you to be more informed than this or else this exchange is useless.  

The fact of the matter is 1914 Accord is Illegal. It was deemed so even by the British Govt of that time themselves(it was only brought back in the mid 30's when China was an utter mess). How can it be deemed legal when China didn't even sign and not just that when the previous half dozen treaties that the British themselves signed mandated that China has to sign off on these things, hence the reason they were freaking there to begin with.

"dj3zs84","Great question! While fugitive slaves settled as far afield as the Atlantic coast, I can speak more specifically on Southwestern Ontario, an area known in Underground Railroad literature as the North Star or Promised Land. Several communities were established in the area, most famously the Dawn Settlement and Buxton, both run by prominent black abolitionists. Rev. Josiah Henson, an escaped slave from Maryland and key figure at Dawn, exported lumber back to the states with the help of white Methodists in Boston, met Queen Victoria on at least one occasion, and became inextricably connected to the titular character of “Uncle Tom’s Cabin.” Frederick Douglass toured the area seeking support for the eventual rebellion at Harper’s Ferry. The rifle he pawned to help pay his expenses can still be seen in the collection of James “Gunsmith” Jones, a black craftsman whose firearms were coveted in Upper Canada at the time. 

Black abolitionists stood on both sides of the Garrisonian debate and many felt that supporting radical antislavery movements in the U.S. (in preference to slaves arriving in Canada) violated international sovereignty and endangered the international movement. In fact recent research by Olivette Otele of Bath Spa University suggests that the British Empire supported anti-slavery efforts in Canada as a “pilot project” to ensure the smooth transition of its far more lucrative Caribbean colonies. 

While Colonial authorities did not return slaves to the U.S. and the importation of slaves was banned in 1793, the border was (and is, to some extent) porous. Marauding American slave-catchers periodically brought people back across, typically splitting the bounty with unscrupulous Canadian informants. 

In short, fugitive slaves and their descendants have a rich but problematic history in Canada, most contemporary slave narratives depict scenes of promise countered by nearly insurmountable hardship. Escaped slaves could establish their own communities (most of which included white settlers) but continued to face institutional racism in addition to the hard reality of life in Canada.

"div4qw6","This is way more info than you asked for, but I figured it may help since these are the things I wish someone told me. Hope you enjoy reading haha.

I have test strips of mahogany, northern black walnut, and then a 2x6. Each strip has tru oil, watco teak, tung, and boiled linseed. The mahogany and 2x6 also have the Minwax poly I mentioned earlier, but the 2x6 was also stained. Now as far as I know, only the poly is marketed as ""outdoor"" use, but I'm pretty sure the teak said it penetrated and hardened in the wood in order to create a protective surface, so that's worth looking in to.

I don't have my test strips in front of me, but from what I remember the tru oil darkens things the most, teak and tung are similar with the main difference being gloss, and boiled linseed the least. It seemed that the oils mainly just increase the contrast to bring out the natural colors of the wood, while also darkening a little. To me, the main benefit is the contrast. Also, all of these are drying oils. If you're like me and started with cutting boards then you know the awesome look mineral oil gives wood - that's mostly because it's non-drying. I'd say Tru oil gives the closest result to mineral oil, but that's just me.

I used two strips of mahogany: one was a very rich and deep, shiny red. The other is less rich, but has moderate curls in it and (mineral?) streaks running through it. Oils made the first one VERY dark and flat and took away the shininess of the surface (which angered me, because I got it specifically for the natural gloss it had). Oils made the curls of the second strip more noticeable, and the tru oil lit the curls up and made it look very impressive and made all the streaks pop with super contrast. Poly also made the curls pop, but only slightly increased the contrast - it didn't darken the wood much. I am making a jewelry box out of the curly mahogany and I've decided to finish it using only polyurethane.

Minwax makes a ton of stains. One that caught my curiosity is their ""Natural"" stain. I am going to pick up a small can and try it some day. They also have a line called something like Polyshade(?) which is stain and poly mixed together. I'd be willing to bet you can find a really moderate Polyshade that has the effect you're looking for, but I'm not real sure. The biggest thing I can tell you is go spend ~$20 on small things of oils and finishes and test them out. Also, googling ""best wood oil for outdoor use"" may help.

Edit: two last things. 1) obviously, make sure whatever you use is good for outdoor use. 2) no matter what you use, you will need to reapply it eventually. I plan on recoating my grill table (Minwax stain and poly) every spring. Some finishes may need more attention than that.",1497390650,"i used two strips of mahogany: one was a very rich and deep, shiny red.","rich and deep","rich",NA,FALSE,"very rich and deep","deep","very",NA,1

I am not a Macron man at all but I have to admit that I like the fact that he seems to work well with Merkel and hopefully we will see better cooperation in the future.

*UK:* The attitude they pretty much always had with EU. Their way to be here and not be here at the same time and block any attempt at progress. In a way I am sad to see them go but in another way I feel like they never really believed in EU as a political project and access to the market was all they always wanted.

"dhfmcdm","The art was archaic at best, bad anatomy, poor dialogue and the overall plot was campier than a prime time holonet video involving three dogs and a teenager in a bodysuit. 

Which seemed to be the idea behind it all: man is rich, but powerless, man puts on suit, suit scares people and he punches the ones that aren't scared enough. In some ways this was almost standard law enforcement procedure now, save that the law was enforced by beta humans rather than playboys. So why then did he seem to have such a following? Why did my grandfather, the most serious and dour person I knew coming up, speak his name with such reverence and sadness?

Page after page of deep net forum searches followed in the next two weeks, I scoured sites that hadn't been seen by the surface web in probably a century. When I asked my grandfather more about it, he just rasped a mirthless laugh through his respirator, passed his palm over mine and looked severe as a message and an ancient torrent magnet url flashed across my lens display. 

""Read them all and you'll understand."" 

I didn't sleep that month. I couldn't. I'd scored a dozen hits of Adderwrong, a class A amphetamine and now seemed as good a time as any to burn through it before a random drug test at work. Across decades of stories, dozens of authors and illustrators, the character truly seemed to take on a life of his own, beyond anything written about him in the dozens of... people wrote academic theses on him? He always seemed juxtaposed across from a man in blue and red pajamas, which I thought laughable until I read a particularly disturbing arc called, *Injustice* and my blood froze. For some reason it was only at that moment I realized how much the red man, ""Superman"" resembled Mutalāṇ, the progenitor of all betas and leader of the People's Republic of Madurai. Suddenly the protests, the political maneuverings, martial law... it was too real, the colors on the page turned into sepia, ""artists renderings"" I'd seen in the documentaries in secondary. 

In the bookmarked margins of the old PDF files, my grandfather had highlighted bits of dialogue. ""Quis custodiet ipsos custodes?"", ""Absolute power corrupts absolutely."" Words and phrases that didn't make sense until reading some other issue written three or four years later. Again and again the two men, one in black and one in red clashed, but they did so most often as friends, usually reconciling after coming against a common enemy, a greater evil. Except *Injustice*. When ultimate good deposes ultimate evil, it must necessarily take its place. 

Again I was drawn back to the holovids, an entire six week period in our Fundamentals class dedicated to the Cleansing. In less than 50 years, the presence of betas had thrown town tyrannical governments, ended world hunger, drastically improved life expectancy and begun the advent of space exploration. So why, why couldn't I stop seeing our savior's face in the one opposite the man in black? Something in the eyes, a restlessness. Anger. Fear? It just kept coming back again and again, one's face superimposed over the other. 

And the man in black, Batman. Always watching, waiting, seemingly never acting on a grand scale until the world was on the brink of destruction and THEN revealing that he'd been preparing for it all along, hoping against hope he wouldn't have to intervene. That he'd wanted to do things peacefully. Big words for someone who spent his free time roughing up bandits. From him I learned that peace has a sliding scale, that violence can also be peace when it means protecting the innocent. We do not kill, but we do avenge ourselves against our oppressors. Batman, Robin, Red Robin, Nightwing, Red Hood, Batgirl, Batwoman, Catwoman, Green Arrow, The Question changed everything from the ground up. Their entire universe was filled with *average* people made extraordinary, the product his labors, believers in an ideal that espoused solidarity and individuality over safety under a dictator. Ours may yet be the same.

That was six years ago. My grandfather went peacefully in his sleep and we never spoke about the man in black again. But I still do. Once a month, here in the deepnet forums and podcasts where the old PDFs have been converted to new formats, new languages and spread like viralfire across the entirety of the human collective consciousness. We don't wear costumes, only the betas can afford to be so public. But I hear that Commandants across the world have begun outlawing wearing all black. Be safe out there, hermanitos. Show your colors with pride, but also with the wisdom of the bat. One day soon we will kiss our lovers in the streets after midnight, we will go where we please without certifications or question. We will eat whatever diet pleases us and dance to the angry songs of our fathers and grandfathers without censor or citation. We will not be helpless, we will not be silent. We ARE Batman.

"dhf6a6i","&gt; The fact remains, certain clubs have much more money than other clubs and spend it accordingly.

Yes, that's true. And wait for Atletico this summer. They'll sell their star players and will sit on top of shit ton of money. If they can manage that money well and plan well, they can continue to find good wonderkids or sign quality players for millions. Like I said, you want to see Atletico as some poor, sunday league club, but they are one of the richest clubs in La Liga and Europe. They'll become richer after they sell their star players this summer. If they waste that income, they'll become shit and that's their fault. If they manage well, they can come back to semi finals or even finals again.

&gt; That puts the sport on an unequal playing field. What some sports and leagues have done is implement a salary cap where the wealth of owners doesn't dictate who wins the games. That's what football needs. Then everyone can talk as much shit as they want about their accomplishments.

I agree with every words here. I also want more balanced football. But you are spitting to the wrong club. Real was once a poor club, Di Stefano and Puskas made it a European powerhouse in 56-60 era. Then the club is managed well and grew it's prestige. And that's not a bad thing. Dortmund would like to be in Real's shoes too. There is no socialism or ""let's all become equal"" bullshit in football clubs, believe me. Dortmund would like to dominate Bayern too. Dortmund would like to sign every wonderkid of Bayern and become like a German best XI. Today it's opposite and you are sad. Tomorrow it may happen like I said and you'll become happy that your club is rich and more powerful than Bayern. That's how the world works.

And also remember UEFA's financial fair play policies. RM is fitting to those policies perfectly. They haven't signed a big budget star after Bale and still managed to become 2 times champions. And look at Barcelona, they suffered from these financial policies. Because they were reckless and stupid. They now have MSN left and rest of the squad is in shambles. Poor planning and bad decisions can prepare the fall of a club like Barcelona. Look at Milan. 7 times UCL champions. Still in the second place after Real in UCL titles. Where are they? They had money and riches and prestige too. What good is your UCL titles if you can't secure club's future?

Like I said, I wasn't a fan of Real because it's a rich club or buying best players. By your comparison we should all become PSG fans, they are building an insane squad with Arab money. No. I was a fan since 2003 or so. And I saw this team getting bossed around by Lyon and other European clubs. But in the end, they worked hard, invested well and spent club money wisely. And RM is never crossing financial fair play policies with it's transfers. Look at the transfers of Isco, Vasquez, Asensio, Casemiro, Kovacic etc. They were all well thought, smart, reasonable transfers. We bought Lucas for 2.5 millions I believe. Now? He worths at least 40-50 million. Same with other players. That's how you manage a club.

So, please think twice before you want to see RM as some rich, villain, anti-football corporate type of club. They are rich, but it's richness have a reason. Other clubs can follow the footsteps and become similar to RM. Or big clubs can make stupid decisions and become like Inter or Milan.

&gt; But for the post's point I definitely agree that the rich benefit more because they have more money... My issue is predominantly with taking money from people

Well, that's the thing. Of course rich people have more money, and many of them earn it (although most were already born into it, along with advantages the rest of us can only dream of), but there's more to being rich than just having more money. Less stress, more time, better education, better health, etc. These aren't necessarily things they pay for - sometimes it's about the right connections, access to the right professionals, having other rich friends that can provide favors or direct you to the best resources/services, etc.

As far as the rest - everyone has money taken from them, even if they don't pay income tax. The issue is that poor people don't benefit from it as much as the rich. This leads to an increasingly wide-divide between rich and poor, making it harder and harder for poor people to climb into the middle class or find wealth. 

There will probably always be poor versus rich, but there's something wrong when the difference between the two keeps growing. That's indicative of a systemic issue! 

To correct it, we could 1) raise income tax rates on the rich, 2) reduce corporate subsidies, tax loopholes, etc. that only the already rich can benefit from, and/or 3) increase social services for the poor to put everyone on a more level playing field (especially better housing, healthcare and education).

He had indeed forgotten about his squad member. Not because he didn't like her, but for the simple reason that he never really remembered anything. The times where he wasn't late or absent for something were due to Seph's responsibility. Normally, he'd rush the scene and spend not even a thought worrying about the consequence of his poor organization. But this was different. Sayuri had been horribly wounded, and if Jiro was in the same position he'd certainly be happy if people visited him. 

""Actually"" he spoke out loud, twirling a chef's knife in his hand. He had been making lunch when Seph told him that it would be best for him to show up at some point. ""If I was in the hospital, I'd like a gift too..."" Dicing through the vegetables and meat he had prepared for himself, finishing the dish and slamming the oven shut he then rushed to grab a different recipe book. 

There were a couple things he'd make which he thought to be impossible to dislike. A chocolate cake, not too rich but still flavorful. Probably with some fruit to compliment the flavor. And a pie. From scratch, the crust, the filling - something with a lot of berries, and he'd put stuff in the batter to make the crust better. Spices, but which? 

He had almost burnt his food, too busy and too focused on preparing desserts for her in order to compensate for his poor timing. 

""The other thing is, what will I say? I bet Seph talked about something interesting."" He continued thinking out loud, eating with one hand and mixing dough with the other. It was quite the sight - his hair was done up nicely, decorated with a white flower which had been gifted to him by the girl who considered him an older brother. Something unseen of for men, but he thought nothing of it. 

After all, who would laugh at a built, tattooed, knife wielding investigator. 

Anyhow, Jiro decided that he'd also compensate for his poor, arguably non-existent social skills with food. The hospital was a confusing process, but after a bit of talking and repeated questioning (he's very forgetful, after all) he somehow managed to get permission to visit. Knocking on the door, opening it slightly and sticking his head through. He looked quite happy, oddly enough. ""Can I come in, Sayuri?"" He was just eager to see if she'd like his gift. If not, he could make something else and come back tomorrow. Actually, he should probably do that regardless.

&gt; A rich but jealous man hires a private investigator to kill his cheating wife and her new man. After that, this cold-hearted thriller really heats up.
(*IMDb*)

**Critical reception:**
&gt; While the film was only a modest box office success, it was a huge critical success. It currently holds a 94% ""fresh"" rating on Rotten Tomatoes, where the critical consensus reads\: ""Brutally violent and shockingly funny in equal measure, Blood Simple offers early evidence of the Coen Brothers' twisted sensibilities and filmmaking ingenuity."" The movie made about $3 million. Its first big public viewing was the USA Film Festival in Dallas, followed by the Sundance Film Festival, where it received the Grand Jury Prize. The brothers took the film to the Toronto Film Festival, Cannes, and the New York Film Festival. They were very proud of their film, particularly in light of having raised the funds using their self-made trailer.

For the sins I would pick **Pride** and **Gluttony**.

Gluttony is for obvious reasons, having free food wherever you go is the best way to live. Besides I could make money off of that, getting free food and then reselling it for a minimum price. Of course I could also do that with Envy, but then it would be stealing and stealing is bad.

Pride because I very much want to be seen as a leader or role model. I always enjoy it when people come to me for advice, and I don't mind having responsibilities. The charisma boost would certainly help as I can be a tad shy around people I don't know well.

Runner-up is Envy, it's just that free food makes me feel less guilty than stolen food.

As for the virtues, my vote goes to **Diligence** and **Kindness**.

Diligence seems like the perfect deal for any high Ne user. You get the willpower to actually finish your projects, *and* you'll manage with only 5 hours of sleep every night.

Kindness pretty much for the same reasons as I stated with Pride.

"dbyk3x6","Wealth redistribution is a socialist principle that basically consists in taking from the rich to give to the poor. Most countries in the world (socialist or not) apply different measures that are considered wealth redistribution, usually mild systems with the objective of taking only enough from rich people to help the poor, so rich people aren't less rich but poor people are less poor.

In practice, these kind of systems have different levels of effectivity, but more or less every developed country has some kind of it, like for example progressive taxes, which means that the more you earn the more you pay, and since social security is funded with taxes, in practice rich people pay for poor people's help, like charity but mandatory.

These kind of systems are considered a little less than stealing and promoting lazy behaviours or living of subsidies by the people in the upper classes of those countries, much like anything the government does with taxes that could be somehow be done by private initiative voluntarily.

That said, then you have revolutionary systems to redistribute wealth, ranging from erasing upper classes and taking their wealth to build the country (the so called proletariat dictatorship or state communism, like USSR), to different levels of wealth redistribution more aggressive than the one I mentioned first, but still using taxes and of course not violence, intimidation or war.

These methods may include nationalizing (taking property away from private owners) certain economic sectors like energy, transportation or natural resources (because allegedly the government the could control prices in basic necessities so they are affordable), applying heavy taxation to the private owned options to public services (like education or health) to fund these public services.

"dbjun2l","I didn't see myself refer to any middle class policies. The only point I was suggesting is that it's foolish to imply that people are simply voting against their best interests when you don't really know what their particular interests are. Some people probably are voting against their best interests and some probably aren't. It's the same for both parties. Further, since Dems and Repubs encompass just an absurdly large amount of ideology and policy, how could anyone possibly agree with every tenet and believe that all of them are in a person's particular interests to the point that it becomes obvious that they should side with one party? 

In terms of the economy, it's tough because your question really focuses on a specific area of policy. It also depends on how you define middle class. It's tough to generalize. I live in Philly, but I have a lot of family that grew up and live in the Midwest. Certainly, out there, there is a slower pace of life and people *tend* to be happier with less money and live a simple lifestyle. Money isn't necessarily the be all end all to life. Further, knowing this, there's evidence to show that while *economic* policies may not benefit the *lower* middle class, in general, they seem to instead favor ideology over economic reality. There is a stronger emphasis on social issues and maintaining their current lifestyle, however those issues are portrayed to them.

However, other information suggests that the Democratic party may not seem to *resonate* with the middle class at all, and instead be the most polarizing, appealing to the most rich and most poor in our country:

http://www.progressivestoday.com/exclusive-census-data-reveals-state-of-democrat-party-the-party-of-broke-people/

I think if you look at non-corporate America and talked to seasoned, small business owners (my father is one of them) they could tell you, just looking at raw data, that business taxes skyrocketed under Obama and under Hillary, they were projected to increase even more. I think Republicans hold on to the *idea* that small business development and sustainability (and a shift away from corporations) is how this country will rebound economically. Again, it's the perception, not *necessarily* the reality. Small business owner doesn't mean successful or rich but there was, in areas, a real fear that the taxation would effectively sink ""the little guy"" that was trying to be an entrepreneur. 

But if money isn't your motivating factor, do you care? Again, favoring ideology over reality, I think there is an appreciable subset of Republican voters that are content to live within their means and not rock the boat. Republicans come along and advocate for lower taxes and a maintaining of their current way of life. 

There's more I could go into with taxation, but I just don't want to get into all that. I'm not even sure I answered the question but while I think it's obvious that, in general, the intent of Democratic economic policy is to bolster a ""middle class"", I think that the perception is that it creates a more ""vanilla"" society that still leaves the elite relatively unscathed and makes society more dependent on the government to survive.

"danpl8g","The Raccoon coat joke

Back in the roaring twenties raccoon coats were the rage, especially among the college set in the ivy league schools. Just any raccoon coat wouldn't do. It had to be a full length duster almost reaching the floor to really be in style. John, a young man with a very rich but miserly father who was entering his freshman year at Harvard was surprised to learn when he moved into the dorm that he just couldn't fit in without a raccoon coat. He pleaded with his father that he just had to have a raccoon coat or would never make it at school. After several letters back and forth his father agreed to purchase a beautiful coat on one condition. The condition was that the coat must not be damaged in any way during the next four years. If there was any damage to the coat at all after four years the John would be disinherited and have to go find a job on his own. He would not be allowed to join the father in his very prosperous business.

John quickly agreed to the conditions without thinking of the implications. The father bought the best raccoon coat money could buy, then had several members of his staff count the number of hairs on the coat. They found there were exactly 1,524,203 hairs. A second group of staff members recounted and confirmed there were 1,524,203 hairs. The coat was then carefully sealed in a package and sent off to Harvard with a note informing the John of the hair count.

When John received the coat he was overjoyed that his ostracism by his fellow students was soon to end. Then he read the enclosed letter. He showed the coat to all his friend but was afraid to wear it under any circumstances for fear of damaging it in some manner. After everyone had seen the coat he resealed it in its box and placed it on the shelf in his closet. He often showed the coat to new friends but could never work up the courage to wear it until his senior year.

Harvard was playing Yale for the conference championship in football. He bought nine tickets to the game, three seats behind his, the seats to either side, and the three seats in front. He was going to be damned sure no one spilled drink or mustard on his beloved coat. He didn't enjoy the game at all because of his concern for his coat. Immediately after the game he returned the coat to the closet where it had been for three years after carefully spending several hours recounting the hairs. All 1,524,203 were intact but after such a tedious job he made a mistake. He didn't reseal the bag in which he had been storing the coat these many years.

During the night a campus moth crawled under the door of the closet, fluttered up onto the box and crawled inside. He had a feast but being a small moth one hair was all his tiny stomach could hold. He emerged from the box, fluttered from the closet and flew up onto the light fixture to get warm and have a nap. The next day the hapless student decided to recheck the hair-count. It took him hours but when finished he knew he was in trouble. There were only 1,524,202 hairs. He wailed in despair at the top of his lungs. All his fraternity brothers came running into the room expecting the worst. John recounted the whole story about his fathers conditions and his impending fate.

In all the commotion the little moth asleep on the light fixture awakened. He listened to the story in amazement. As the whole story unfolded the moth became terribly sad.

"d8oxugi","&gt; I think it's also worth noting that Aristotle is definitely not a liberal in this respect, but I don't particularly think we should have expected him to be, nor is he a socialist. He is instead someone advocating for the Greek Polis, working in the context of his time in an extremely different intellectual field. To try and read liberal or socialist ideas back into him would be horribly anachronistic.

I would most heartily agree, especially as it appears to me he sees the polis not as the state outside of the people, but as the people who exist within it and that it serves. (although it definitely becomes blurred, as the formal role of the demagogue is something that brings much more explicit connotations on responsibility than the stratigraphication of most modern societies). I know there was a tendency within the Roman World for the rich to reinvest their riches as a way of formalising their relationship with both the state and the people, and I wonder what he means when confiscated property becomes sacred. 

This part in particular 

&gt; Yet the true friend of the people should see that they be not too poor, for extreme poverty lowers the character of the democracy; measures therefore should be taken which will give them lasting prosperity; and as this is equally the interest of all classes, the proceeds of the public revenues should be accumulated and distributed among its poor, if possible, in such quantities as may enable them to purchase a little farm, or, at any rate, make a beginning in trade or husbandry.

Appears to suggest that it's not necessarily the responsibility of the polis itself, but it's ruler to make sure the access is at a level healthy to the people, and thus to the integrity of the polis; and it seems that he's suggesting someone who is publically minded,would see it within their purpose, or integrity, to see that there isn't the extreme disenfranchisement resulting on poverty, but such that the relief encourages participation as a member qua rational.

&gt; To the modern liberal thinker looking back, the hardest part to synthesize with Aristotle might be the focus on individual rights. ""Consent of the governed"" was simply not part of issues Aristotle dealt with. Aristotle had great insight, but to call him ""modern"" or ""progressive"" is simply misleading.

I'd definitely agree with that, it is hard to see classical thinkers in modern lights, and so many of his thoughts are correcting the system he's in, that its hard to apply it in a way true to character without distorting the message (i guess what strikes out as being the 'progressive aspect' of Aristotle's argument is that the leading conatus of the polity, if truly a person of the people, would seek such that poverty is eliminated regardless of personal preference - Living in the UK the Conservative party often claims to be the party of the people, and yet poverty is something they often don't tackle/do exacerbate so I can see where the author is seeing similarities)

It has piqued my interests in the role of the sacred and public aswell, so much so (even just for the hints of differences in how their societies are structured)

I don't know if the original article suggested it as a taking away, but it definitely does feel more along the lines of re-distribution, it's just on a wholly different line of who is responsible for their wealth being redistributed, I guess it's easy to draw the parallel in modernity that it's everyone, or the rich, but that's definitely not the claim Aristotle is making, it seems much more suggestive of that in the hands of the demagogue, within reasonable limits -although I'm still left with the feeling that he might not accredit being rich and powerful as virtuous, more that unfair persecution of such leads to a despoticism qua personal gain of the masses",1476288867,"i'd definitely agree with that, it is hard to see classical thinkers in modern lights, and so many of his thoughts are correcting the system he's in, that its hard to apply it in a way true to character without distorting the message (i guess what strikes out as being the 'progressive aspect' of aristotle's argument is that the leading conatus of the polity, if truly a person of the people, would seek such that poverty is eliminated regardless of personal preference - living in the uk the conservative party often claims to be the party of the people, and yet poverty is something they often don't tackle/do exacerbate so i can see where the author is seeing similarities)  it has piqued my interests in the role of the sacred and public aswell, so much so (even just for the hints of differences in how their societies are structured)  i don't know if the original article suggested it as a taking away, but it definitely does feel more along the lines of re-distribution, it's just on a wholly different line of who is responsible for their wealth being redistributed, i guess it's easy to draw the parallel in modernity that it's everyone, or the rich, but that's definitely not the claim aristotle is making, it seems much more suggestive of that in the hands of the demagogue, within reasonable limits -although i'm still left with the feeling that he might not accredit being rich and powerful as virtuous, more that unfair persecution of such leads to a despoticism qua personal gain of the masses","rich, but that","rich","but",TRUE,"rich and powerful","powerful",NA,NA,1

I wouldn't choose a career based on the income nor based on what my parents want me to be (in order to brag to other parents about it). I would rather be a poor, but happy gardener than a rich, but sad lawyer.

I don't do bodybuilding in order to feed my ego but rather in order to defeat it. Most people in the gym are sadly not there to change themselves for the better, but only to feed their ego. Would you give money to a beggar and then brag on Facebook about what a good person you are? Many people do exactly that with their training. They wouldn't train, if they were the last person on earth, because there would be nobody that could give them the attention they desire and crave.

I don't think that we share all the same purpose. But even if, not all your goals have to allign with your purpose. One of your goals could be to be in great shape or learning how to dance. These goals wouldn't fit your purpose, but they could still enhance your life quality.

How old are you if I might ask? I remember that many folks back in school gave me the same answer when asked about what they want to do in their life.

Got it. Now I know you think you know what he said, but this time pay attention because he leaked a state secret:

&gt;You can sleep with them, you can bring them in, you can do whatever you want. The little I ask you is not to promote it on [Instagram] and not to bring them to my games.... Don't put him [Magic Johnson] on an Instagram for the world to have to see so they have to call me... Yeah, it bothers me a lot that you want to broadcast that you're associating with black people. Do you have to?...You're supposed to be a delicate white or a delicate Latina girl.

Here's a question: who is THEY who have to call him? Why is a gazillionaire 3 years from God's judgment worried about They? And why would They care what his girlfriend does? The implication is that They are even more racist than he is, which should blow your mind when you consider They are about to pretend to try to take his team away from him and give him $600M.

But the other possibility-- which coexists with the first-- is that They don't exist, not in any coordinated way: They are you, the public, far more dangerously racist than he is because his racism is overt and yours is disavowed. What he is worried about is that you will see a picture of ""a delicate white or Latina"" girl next to a guy with large sneakers and... film your own conclusions.

Some clueless TV types have deduced that she set him up. Duh. Then they tried to figure out why he hooked up with such a manipulative harpy, and I therefore know with 100% certainty that to them having a hot young girlfriend is an unattainable fantasy. But he didn't have a choice: his superego required it, as a condition of his identity he is obligated to have a mistress, a miss-stress-- a girlfriend who is way more headache than any wife he was ""bored"" with. Since everything is possible, he is obligated to enjoy-- and if it isn't enjoyable there must be something preventing it, and that obstruction has to be her fault, or They's fault, what it can't be is his fault. He's 80, his sexuality is... on the decline. If he can't enjoy sex someone else has to enjoy it for him, in his place: no, not the black guy, but her-- she is doing the enjoying for him. Being cuckolded-- that's what this is, right?-- is fine, it works for him, as long as he isn't humiliated in public. ""It's ok if They see me as a racist because I AM a racist, I accept it as part of my identity, there's no shame in it; but if They think I'm not satisfying her, or worse-- if they think I'm a cuckold-- if they don't see me the way I want to be seen----""

""If only you were the girl I thought you were!"" he said, paraphrased. But of course she was the girl you thought she was-- she picked you. When you pick a woman for certain reasons, you are also picking the kind of woman who wants to be picked for those reasons. You may even have succeeded in tricking her that you like her for other reasons, but this is irrelevant: you like the kind of girl who likes the kind of guy who pretends to like women for other reasons....... But in any event, his desires were illogical, they can't actually coexist, so it must be They's fault.

It is heartwarming to think of the backlash against Sterling as a new intolerance of racism, and I'm told his case is important to society because he's famous and rich, but his money doesn't come with any power. So while you are all glowing in self-righteousness because you outed another racist rich guy, consider that you will never hear a recording of the head of Goldman Sachs making racist statements. ""Maybe he's more progressive?"" Hmm. Or maybe power won't allow it, power won't even allow you to think about it. The more likely explanation-- remember, basketball is a TV show on The Disney Channel the outcome of which couldn't be less relevant to humanity-- is that it is projection, it represents frantic activity as a defense against change. ""I'm not a racist-- because THAT's a racist!""

The only people who might do such a thing (integrate work and their personal lives) are small or even middle-sized business owners who have invested themselves and their lives into their business. 

Most of the 20th century the rich (multi-millionaires, billionaires, etc...) were taxed 2/3 or so of their income, while the lower and middle classes were taxed 1/3. Then Reagan took office and lowered it down to the biggest degree seen. By the end of Reagan's administration he said that the only thing he regreted were the massive deficits he caused. It should be noted that Dick Cheney and Donald Rumsfield were a part of the Reagan, Bush Sr., and Bush Jr. administrations and they were the ones who first heard of the laffer curve (where supply-side economics sprouted from)  [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laffer_curve)

&gt;Although economist Arthur Laffer does not claim to have invented the Laffer curve concept, it was popularized in the United States with policymakers following an afternoon meeting with Ford Administration officials **Dick Cheney** and **Donald Rumsfeld** in 1974 in which he reportedly sketched the curve on a napkin to illustrate his argument.[6] The term ""Laffer curve"" was coined by Jude Wanniski, who was also present at the meeting. The basic concept was not new; Laffer himself notes antecedents in the writings of the 14th-century social philosopher Ibn Khaldun.

Go back to increasing taxes on the rich, but lower taxes on businesses (if the businesses stay, trust me, the rich aren't going anywhere). Also, create tax incentives for big businesses to have an American workforce of greater than 95%. In the end, business taxes across the board being 0% would be great and would attract many businesses to America. Also increase tarrifs on goods from China and India.

Although City in the Sky was a rather misleading to it’s true appearance, a chunk of land being held up by four immense stone giants. The adventurer didn’t care one way or another what it was called so long as he made it to the top. If the legends were true, the adventurer knew that he would become the greatest man in the world. On one hand, he could find an infinite army which did only his bidding. Or he could find immense mountains of gold coins. And it was all hidden. Hidden in the City in the Sky.

Finally, with three feet to go, the adventurer reached the top. His body was aching with both the pain of his unfathomable climb and anticipation for what riches awaited him at the top.

With his strength regained, the adventurer stood up and yelled to the world. He had accomplished a task of legend and he was about to acquire legendary rewards for it. Surely the stone giants holding up the City in the Sky were now his to command. He strode through the dry overgrown grass onto a cracked street. Once it had been a road of perfectly sculpted stone slabs, but now moss grew where there once was grout and the stones were uneven and cracked.

"d2z4gnq","&gt;you know this and haven't thought about the correlation between wealth inequality and capital flight and desperate social conditions.

Oddly enough, and something many don't realize, is what leads to capital flight is excessive taxation. Not necessarily *high* taxes; but effective tax rates of upwards 90%. Look at Sweden's economy in the 1970s: they moved towards Democratic Socialism (something Bernie Sanders has revived) with an effective tax rate of 90%. What was the result? Their economy crashed because *all private enterprise left the country* on top of them having a very generous welfare program. It wasn't until Sweden cut taxes and allowed their tech sector to grow that their economy rebounded.

On the matter of ""wealth inequality"", I find the argument to be heavily flawed because the reasoning is often a moral stance and not an economic one. People go: ""look at all of these rich people with wealth! Isn't this bad that so few people own so much?"", well no, not when you live in a free market where people are free to engage in mutual transactions. All ""wealth inequality"" is, is a means to show a difference between what you and I make vs. what Bill Gates makes.

&gt;Severe wealth inequality leads to instability, which can be quite bad for business not to mention your health.

Not necessarily. It greatly depends on the country, their resources, their government policy towards the market, and their trade, among other factors. The Soviet Union for all intents and purposes had 0 Wealth Inequality because everyone was equally starving to death due to government mismanagement. Yet, the government officials weren't starving. The government officials drove nice cars, were escorted in nice limos, and lived lives of luxury. THAT is real *wealth inequality*. Compare that to the rich and poor today in America: there is almost nothing that differentiates a poor person from a rich person in material value. The poor have TVs, just like the rich. The poor have cars, just like the rich. The poor have access to health care, just like the rich.

I agree businesses tend to move. Just not people. People prefer to stay in their home country regardless of their income tax rate.


My personal position is I am in favor of high income tax rates on the rich, but low corporate taxes. [Lowering corporate taxes is seen as good by economists by a significant majority](http://www.npr.org/sections/money/2012/07/19/157047211/six-policies-economists-love-and-politicians-hate)

"d26m95v","Really? I may have misunderstood the meaning of trickle-down. To me it's such an obvious idea that seeing everyone saying ""yup, it doesn't work"" is baffling. I see it only as a rebuff to the rather naive and paranoid idea that rich people withhold their money from others. Here's what I think it means:

Person A (whose socialistic feelings have been roused): ""There's no use in this world for rich people, they just hoard all the money to keep the common folk poor.""

Person B (patiently explaining trickle-down): ""The only way they could keep their money to themselves would be to literally stash their fortune away in suitcases full of banknotes, and never spend it, in which case it would be no use to them. If they put it in a bank, the bank will use it to loan to other people, who will invest it in things such as new businesses that employ the not-rich. If they spend it on golden bath fittings, ornamental duck ponds, luxury cars, or stays in fancy hotels, some working person has to do the plumbing, breed the ducks, engineer the car's gearbox or do the hotel's laundry. Perhaps those are prestigious jobs, so perhaps those workers are themselves somewhat rich, but then they, too, have to use the money somehow, probably spending it on more mundane things like a new washing machine, a bird table, a second-hand luxury-esque car or a visit to an amusement park. The point being that money, like energy, doesn't get destroyed but keeps circulating around in return for people being useful to one another, and if it only circulated among rich people, all they would be able to buy with it is whatever rich people produce, so they might be able to buy a lot of stock market guidance and property ripe for development and maybe one or two thoroughbred stallions, but they wouldn't have any furniture, or engines in their cars, or any food (unless they eat the horses) and really if they used their money only in this way it would be worth next to nothing to them.""

Person A: ""Now that you say it, it seems impossible that it could be any other way, so I apologize for having had a cartoon image of rich people squatting on top of big piles of money like dragons. Obviously that would be the opposite of being rich, being rich is having money to spend, usually by investing it.""

The other odd thing in this thread is that people keep saying *wealth* instead of money. It's an important distinction. I suppose the idea must be that the ordinary poor people aren't getting more material wealth over time; the quality of life for a typical working person isn't improving, because the rich have some tacit vampiric conspiracy to syphon off all material improvements in living standards for themselves.

Well, financial crashes muddy the waters: and there are other weirdnesses, like oil is very cheap presently, and it's always very hard to say what would happen ""naturally"" in economics when the world is full of unnatural machinations. Even so, I think the daily living experience of a typical not-rich Westerner has been steadily improving. We constantly have more variety and lower prices in gadgets, entertainment, foodstuffs, travel, household items. This is just a result of business people somewhere being clever, inventing cheaper ways to produce or ship more things faster, or designers making nicer designs, or actual inventors innovating. Creativity makes wealth over time, for everyone, and it would be really weird if it didn't. How exactly would the rich be supposed to prevent that happening?

I suspect that what people (with socialistic inclinations) *really* want ""trickle-down"" to mean is an idea about levelling-off over time, so that the poor become less different from the rich. Obviously that isn't happening, but so long as everybody's getting wealthier, why would you want it to? There's an argument about the super-rich being too powerful, though I don't understand by what metric ""too"" is arrived at, and why if it's wrong for some guy to have ten billion more currency units than you, it wouldn't also be wrong (to a lesser degree) for me to have three.

But this aspect of power doesn't even seem to be at the core of the complaint. There seems to be a visceral resentment of the rich just for being rich, and particular distaste for ""the rich getting richer"", as the phrase goes, with the implication that they're screwing the poor over *just by owning things,* even though they *aren't* and the poor are doing steadily better for themselves as human knowledge increases, just like we all are.

"d1dpbot","I was you just a few years ago. What you wrote sounds little too familiar. I was working for small company as an executive VP and CTO and I made good money. But not ""fuck you"" kind of money. I didn't know how to grow from there, thus I trusted my CEO to do that for me. I had no debt, 500k in savings and shitload of promises from my CEO to make me rich in few years. Time flew by, little too fast actually, and none of those promises materialized. I made the same money, I was able to accumulate because I am frugal, but the financial freedom I wanted was nowhere in sight and I was getting older. I then realized I cannot rely on other people to do it for me. They lead and you follow. If they fail, they will justify their failures, will keep asking you to follow, because the pot of gold is just around the corner. I was a good foot-soldier, but it takes more than that to be successful.

I started businesses on the side while keeping my job. I had 10-20 failures. I lost count. I had businesses in EU, Singapore, and the US. I started small and simple projects and then tried more elaborate schemes. Nothing really worked. And these were good ideas; people have done them after I tried and made a killing. I wasn't proficient in all aspects of running a business. I could build the idea, but I couldn't market it and get the cash-flow going. I tried partnering with people to help me with that. One thing I realized is that there are many ""money hungry"" people out there, but very few have the stamina and ambition to last. I have been screwed by partners more than I'd like to admit. People bailing mid project, people slacking or vanishing all together... Everyone wants to be rich, but very few are stubborn enough to make it happen. Which in retrospect sounds bit ironic. I too didn't stick around for a decade to see if my CEO's vision will come true. I left after several failures and what I perceived as mismanagement of the company.

Well eventually I got tired of dealing with partners and I went back to basics. I was trying to find a problem some company had out there and solve it for them. If I can save them money, they will pay me money to help them. The ole proven formula. It took several tries, but I did make it. I still don't have ""fuck you"" money, but I think with bit of luck, blood and tears I can get there. I definitely reached  level above a small company's EVP/CTO.

Thus my advice: 1) it is unlikely your employer will make you rich (there are exceptions of course), 2) be careful who you partner with it can cost you money and time, 3) it is going to take a lot of work to make it and 4) luck always helps.

One thing that I have noticed: fake it till you make it seems to work if you have the personality for it. It's not my style since I am not a show-off, I dress like a bum and don't like to buy expensive things. But if you go out and lie to people and are willing to back those lies up with few flashy things, they will take your word for it. You can leverage that trust to make business connections and milk them. I live in Miami right now, and I see people doing this all the time.

"d0mw4hw","To be honest, my Kingdom of Jersualem in CK1 was pretty attrocious. 

I started as Naples and expanded via selective conquest. I also selectively ate provinces with high base tax, as CK1 was kind of a 'insert gold, receive troops' kind of deal. The opportunistic land-grabing I was doing resulted in a far flung sprawl of territories, few of them interconnected with one another outside the hub of Libya and Southern Italy.

Here's where things get dark, or at least darker than genocidal holy war. An order of Knights somehow managed to take Jerusalem, retaking the Holy Land. I was in a position to help this nation bloom by destroying its enemies, but instead I opportunistically crushed them to steal their Kingdom title (I wanted one so I could have vassal dukes). Doing this allowed the Seljuks to take the Holy Land, increasing the rate via which they conquered Byzantium (which almost always happened in those days). 

Not satisfied with destroying one bulwark of Christiandom, I rebelled against my Byzantine overlords to steal the title of King of Greece. In the process, I laid waste to the last descendants of Rome, and with the Imperial Treasury emptied, its armies crushed and its provinces ravaged it quickly fell apart. Instead of focusing on making a sustainable state, I just kept poaching provinces purely for the income - so I was rich, but still unable to defend myself from potential attacks later after inevitably the Seljuks steamrolled through the decaying corpse of the great Bulwark of Christiandom. 

As if this wasn't bad enough, the Pope decided to call a crusade for Valencia (why, I'll never know). I of course immediately raided Valencia by sea, took it, and in doing so screwed the local Christian kingdoms out of any potential land grabs themselves. This allowed a minor Beydom to snowball into a massive, Hispania and Africa spanning blob, which promptly retook Valencia after I betrayed my vassals and left them to their fate to buy myself a few more years to let my armies replenish. 

And thats when the ex-King of Nubia, a drooling inbred moron, inherited the throne via dynastic shennanigans (I was new). I was relegated to a count in Khazaria (I took it for some reason) and watched as the last great Christian state (France and Germany exploded) was run into the ground. He gave all of my former demense away, emptying the treasuries, and promptly lost so hard to a holy war from the west that the Saracens were able to take Rome and start eating the Italian minors. The Seljuks promptly took all the holdouts to the East. I effectively doomed Europe to conquest and colonial rule (since there were no vassal limits, in CK1 blobs just stayed that way unless, like, 12 kings got assassinated in a row). 

tl;dr In my search for income I destroyed any chance for Europe to not be conquered, put to the torch and ruled from far-away overlords.

"czb50nb","*Deep breath*

I should say first of all that Hanson is (or rather, was once) a very capable Classicist. He knows the sources very well, and he knows how to write about them in an accessible and engaging way. His PhD thesis, which was published as *Warfare and Agriculture in Classical Greece* (1983, 2nd ed. 1998), is an excellent piece of scholarship with a number of very insightful contributions to the field. His article on the battle of Leuktra (1988) is the best article on that topic ever to have appeared, and I believe it should have ended the Leuktra controversy then and there.

However, everything he was written since 1988 is drivel. It is increasingly ideological drivel, with very little academic merit, as /u/Zinegata points out. He simply rehashes the same thesis over and over again, with ever less justification and ever wider supposed implications.

That thesis was first set out in *The Western Way of War: Infantry Battle in Classical Greece* (1989) (hereafter WWW) and expanded in *The Other Greeks* (1995). It is meant to explain the nature of Greek warfare as summed up in this passage from Herodotos:

&gt; ""Yet the Greeks do wage war, I hear, and they do so senselessly, in their poor judgment and stupidity. When they have declared war against each other, they find the finest, flattest piece of land and go down there and fight, so that the victors come off with terrible loss – I will not even begin to speak of the defeated, for they are utterly destroyed.""

-- Hdt. 7.9b.1 (quoting the Persian Mardonios)

Hanson's basic argument is this. Since its appearance in the late 8th century BC, hoplite armour was not the exclusive privilege of the rich, but it was not quite affordable to the poor; it was, instead, the typical equipment of the 'middling' class (or 'yeomen'), who used it to raise themselves to prominence as a social, economic and political body in the early Archaic period. They had a stake in defending their community from invasion, because they owned the land. Hoplite equipment gave them the means to protect their farms, which in turn gave them the right to determine the policy of their community. They developed a type of government that favoured them as a middle class (i.e. democracy) and a type of warfare that served best to protect their farms against devastation.

Hanson himself describes this way of war as an 'absurd conspiracy' between the hoplite middle classes of various Greek states. Basically, instead of fighting long, drawn-out wars of raid and conquest, they all got together on the very plains they were trying to protect, and fought an open battle there, hoplite phalanx against hoplite phalanx. Tacit rules against trickery, combined arms warfare and targeting civilians reduced war to a single afternoon of hard fighting among equals. Hoplite farmers did not intend to destroy the enemy, but merely to physically push him off the land; the outcome of this fair clash was accepted as decisive, and would end the war.

For an outsider like Mardonios, this way of war would look stupid, but for the Greeks (according to Hanson), it was preferable to the ""skirmishing"", ambushes and trickery that was typical of ""the East"". The fighting was brutal, but it was honest, fair, and short. It meant that the main group within society could keep its land and people safe from harm. When the Persians invaded, they discovered that this Greek ""senselessness"" was superior to their own way of war. According to Hanson, it was the origin of the ongoing ""Western"" tradition (the WWW) to prefer decisive all-out pitched battle between heavy infantry armies in the open.

Thanks to Hanson's writing skill and the apparently persuasive model he presents, WWW and the edited volume *Hoplites* that appeared two years later have become some of the cornerstones of the study of Greek warfare. WWW is something of a bestseller, and has defined the content of the bit on Greek warfare in textbooks on Greek history ever since. John Keegan adopted it wholesale in his *A History of Warfare*. A few scholars (notably Donald Kagan, Adam Schwartz and Gregory Viggiano) are still fighting Hanson's corner, taken in by the charm of his overall model and the way it reflects on the ancient Greeks and on ourselves.

Other scholars, however, are, shall we say, less convinced.

The first important point is that the view of Greek warfare as a very limited conflict between middling hoplites over farmland is not new. Hanson knows this; he is more than happy to credit Grundy (1911) for the majority of his model (and its essentials go back nearly a century more, to the work of George Grote). Pretty much the only thing Hanson added to this traditional and long entirely uncontroversial view is the ideological argument that this restricted type of warfare was a Western middle class thing throughout history. Essentially, the part that he gets most criticism for (especially when he tries to write about eras other than Archaic and Classical Greece) is WWW’s only original contribution to scholarship.

The second point is that the view of Greek warfare as a very limited conflict between middling hoplites over farmland *is rubbish.* Perhaps we needed Hanson’s engaging synopsis of the model to finally feel the need to say something about it; in any case, for the last two decades, every single part of the theory has been decisively proven false.

An endless list of examples of trickery, ambushing, night fighting, raids, sieges and skirmishes demonstrates very clearly that there was never a time when Greek warfare was limited to the clash of hoplites in the open. Pitched battles were rare; irregular warfare was the norm. The presence of archers, javelin throwers and cavalry throughout both literary and iconographic sources proves that warfare was never a matter of hoplites alone. The list of examples of brutal, even genocidal ruthlessness against both routed enemies and citizen populations shows that the Greeks were not at all concerned to limit the destructiveness of their wars. There are only a few doubtful sources that show any kind of restrictions, and an overwhelming body of evidence to show that these were isolated and often hilariously unsuccessful attempts to rein in the bloodthirstiness of the average Greek warrior.

The Greek sources themselves can be used to show that the juxtaposition between the close-combat-prone, heavily armed West and the skirmishing, lightly armed East is completely wrong. It is the Persians who invariably opt to fight a pitched battle in the open, knowing their superior organisation and combined arms tactics are more likely to win them victory; the Greeks wisely try to avoid fighting the Persians in the open, knowing that they will lose. They instead focus on attacking by surprise (Marathon, Salamis), holding bottlenecks (Thermopylai), and drawing the enemy into broken ground (Plataia). The Persian infantry, moreover, is *never* seen to skirmish. They set down their shield wall and fight the Greeks hand to hand. The first example we get of a skirmishing Persian army is during the chase of the fleeing Ten Thousand, when there really is no need for the Persians to engage in melee.

More structurally, the works of Lin Foxhall and Hans van Wees have pointed out the fatal flaw of Hanson’s entire model: *there is no Greek middle class.* The middling farmer on which he based his entire theory is neither archaeologically nor textually attested until the late 6th century BC. Initially, the hoplite body consisted of a small number of wealthy landowners – the class of citizen V.D. Hanson himself belongs to, too, much as he would like to claim that he is a ‘middling farmer’. During the Classical period, hoplites were  a mixed group of rich and poor citizens trying to flesh out the ranks of the phalanx. At no point do the hoplites represent a single social, economic or political group. They are not a unified body with shared interests, and they do not determine the policy of the city-state for their own benefit. Much as Hanson would like to shout about how the landowning middle class is the backbone of any stable democracy, the link between the two is completely invisible in early Greece, and the association is imaginary. A much more sophisticated and inclusive model of Greek socio-political development has been outlined by Hans van Wees in his chapter for the volume *Men of Bronze* (2013) – directly followed by Hanson raving that he is actually still right, and no one has shown that he is wrong, and (I am not making this up) he must be right because he’s only repeating what 150 years of scholarship has claimed.

Among the current generation of postgraduates and early-career researchers on Greek warfare, Hanson is, quite frankly, a laughing stock.

"cydluu9","The problem is that Richer Houses like the **Lannisters**, **Tyrells** and **Hightowers** can afford to employ second and third cousins in positions of power (thus supporting their families and keeping them prominent) and pay dowries for their daughters to have good marriages. 

There are other branches of the Great Houses. Ned **Stark** had female cousins in the Vale and we know that there are other Stark branches in the North. According to GRRM;

&gt;There are probably some descendants of offshoot branches from the family tree floating around the north, most likely in White Harbor and Barrowton.

So they exist, they are just not important to the story. Should all of Neds children die they would have a claim on Winterfell, depends on how much support they would get.

While the line of Jon Arryn is in trouble we know that there are plenty of **Arryns** still around in the Vale:

&gt;*The eldest married Ser Denys Arryn, a distant cousin to the Lords of the Eyrie. There are several branches of House Arryn scattered across the Vale, all as proud as they are penurious, save for the Gulltown Arryns, who had the rare good sense to marry merchants. They're rich, but less than couth, so no one talks about them. Ser Denys hailed from one of the poor, proud branches*

So after Robin, Harry it would revert to one of the other branches. Something similar happened during the reign of Aenys I when the main branch of Arryn was wiped out and it went to a cousin. 

**Martell** should also be doing fine. Manfrey Martell is Doran's cousin and we know he is married. There is likely more Martells in the story.

Asha **Greyjoy** mentions other branches in her chapters in ADWD:

&gt;*Her cousin Quenton Greyjoy sent three men up trees, to watch for any sign of torches in the woods...""Aye,"" said Dagon Greyjoy, a cousin still more distant.*

The **Tullys** and **Baratheons** are only in trouble because they have lost their lands. There has been no need to mention other cousins as both Houses seem to have their fair share of people during the series who come before the cousins.

Yes.  I am the daughter of a Boston attorney.  My family is well off (not 1% rich, but upper middle class to lower upper class fits well; dad owns his firm so it's hard to place a salary for reference as it changes yearly).  I have been surrounded by some of the things some people think are so great for a majority of my life.  I can see right through the bullshit.  The rich guy in the tux is an asshole, and his wife acts as childish as a high school kid.  I guess it's cool being able to afford to go to 5 star resorts and eat at expensive restaurants, but the allure wears off real fast when you see through all of the shit.  It's like everybody is keeping up this image in order to impress each other without really caring about their own happiness.  You have to do x because otherwise y person will think z of you and God forbid that happens.  There's a ton of gossip and passive aggressiveness involved too.  It's suffocating.

"cxw01k5","&gt; also, i doubt anyone on this sub has the time/patience to systematically go through every designer brand and point out why they are shitty nor do i believe that this is even possible because no one has an index of designers extensive enough to accomplish this

Right. That's my entire point.

&gt; yes, middle-class people can still participate in designer fashion by buying second hand or by budgeting their money but this doesnt change the fact that outside of specific internet hobbyists no one fucking does this.

In other words: fashion is exclusive to the rich but poor people can still play if they want, except only people who are interested in fashion do so while those who aren't interested in fashion don't do so thus classism! wtf. Might as well say that kombucha is classist because it's generally a yuppie drink, and for poorer people besides specific hobbyists no one fucking drinks this therefore it's classist.

"cxp2qnt","I'm going to repeat what I commented another poster last week.

You can grow up materially rich but emotionally poor. Money and love are not interchangeable.  Unfortunately, many Ns, no matter their income, don't understand this.

My last year of graduate school I lived with a girl who, in many ways, had a life opposite to mine.  She has grown up materially poor - she would tell me stories from her childhood with her single mother and it was clear that they never had much.

But the thing is, her mother was amazing.  The woman had taught her daughter so many emotional and practical skills.  This girl was generous and kind, constantly working for charity, had a good diet and exercise routine, had gone to top shools, could sew her own clothes and dye her own hair.

This girl, who had basically nothing and had to wait for her loan check every month to buy groceries, was absolutely APALLED at my relationship with my own mother.  It turns out her own GMa was an N and she recognized the behavior immediately.  She said she felt so lucky to have the mom she had.

The point here is that it's not a contest, that the two aren't the same.  There are many ways in which my friend wished her life and childhood had been easier, better, less of struggle.  There are many things she had to put up with that I am very lucky to have never had to.  But at the same time, both of us recognized that she had one thing I never had, and that was loving respect and kindness from my NMom.",1449409990,"you can grow up materially rich but emotionally poor.","rich but emotionally","rich","but",FALSE,"materially rich but emotionally poor","poor","materially","emotionally",1
"cxoxnif","I'd much rather have been born a woman than a man.  There are a lot more options there.  Obviously if I could be choosing, I'd also choose to have been born able bodied and rich.  But, the with being a woman I would get to choose between working and staying home.  Choose between being taken seriously and being taken care of.  Guys have significantly less options in life now.  

The only reason I can see for choosing to be a man is for the advantage of physical strength, since I don't know what that's like I only see the social and legal disadvantages.  And, my worth being judged by what I can do for others instead of any kind of inherent worth.  

And, ""institutional"" prejudices aside.  You forgot ""white"" and ""men"".  Both of those groups face plenty of prejudice especially from the ""progressive"" left.

There was once a time when New England groaned under the actual pressure of heavier wrongs than those threatened ones which brought on the Revolution. James II., the bigoted successor of Charles the Voluptuous, had annulled the charters of all the colonies and sent a harsh and unprincipled soldier to take away our liberties and endanger our religion. The administration of Sir Edmund Andros lacked scarcely a single characteristic of tyranny—a governor and council holding office from the king and wholly independent of the country; laws made and taxes levied without concurrence of the people, immediate or by their representatives; the rights of private citizens violated and the titles of all landed property declared void; the voice of complaint stifled by restrictions on the press; and finally, disaffection overawed by the first band of mercenary troops that ever marched on our free soil.
The Threefold Destiny (1838, 1842). The masques, mummeries and festive customs described in the text are in accordance with the manners of the age. And, without unity of impression, the deepest effects cannot be brought about. Throughout this article also, the artist is conspicuous--not more in positive than in negative merits.
We naturally personify it, and conceive its massy walls and its dim emptiness to be instinct with a calm and meditative and somewhat melancholy spirit. The Vision of the Fountain (1835, 1837). Its products are never so rich, but infinitely more numerous, and more appreciable by the mass of mankind. To read these stories is to understand anew why Hawthorne is a great artist and an astonishingly contemporary one. A painter would at once note their leading or predominant feature, and style it repose.
Meantime, here are the children assembling to the Sabbath-school, which is kept somewhere within the church. Often, while looking at the arched portal, I have been gladdened by the sight of a score of these little girls and boys in pink, blue, yellow and crimson frocks bursting suddenly forth into the sunshine like a swarm of gay butterflies that had been shut up in the solemn gloom. Or I might compare them to cherubs haunting that holy place. About a quarter of an hour before the second ringing of the bell individuals of the congregation begin to appear.

To ensure the album tied in with the film it was decided the song must be included on what by January 1970 had become the Let It Be album. Also, Lennon s contributions to the sessions were sparse, and this unreleased piece was seen as a way to fill the gap.[ Although the song was extensively rehearsed on the Twickenham Studios soundstage, the only recordings were mono transcriptions for use in the film soundtrack. No multitrack recordings were made after the group s move to Apple Studios.

"cwznv5y","Sorry, **why** must someone assimilate to their new home country? As long as their lifestyle doesn't actually hurt their new home country, why **must** they assimilate?

A lot of people cannot learn a new language. They're simply too old to and/or their mother tongue is simply way, **way** too different from their new home country's language for them to easily grasp it. This is the reason why if you pluck a random assortment of a dozen people residing in the U.S. over the age of 40 who emigrated recently and group them by mother tongue, you'll notice how people who speak the same mother tongue generally tend to make the same grammatical mistakes when speaking English.

For example, if you take 12 random Spanish speaking immigrants, you'll probably have a majority of them say something like ""Here yesterday I Was."" because that's a perfectly logical way to order those words in Spanish (IIRC).

A lot of refugees also do not plan on staying indefinitely, only 'til they can return to their home countries, so there's even less of an incentive for them to try to learn a completely different language so late in life. But most people will **try** to learn the language if they stay for longer than year. It doesn't mean they will succeed. Or that they aren't trying if they don't succeed. This is why so many elderly people rely on younger relatives to help them navigate every day life in their new home countries. If they hated their new home country so much, they wouldn't allow their young ones to assimilate. The fact that someone cannot assimilate linguistically to their new home country does not automatically mean that they're doing so by active choice or maliciously.

Now onto cultural norms. Why must someone assimilate the cultural norms of their new home country in order to be accepted by their new neighbours? Unless someone is indulging in illegal acts or acts that hurt their new home country, what difference does it make if they keep their cultural norms and do not embrace the cultural norms of their home country? What difference does it make to **you** if a random Syrian refugee doesn't start having 4th of July barbecues? How does that fact hurt **you** in any way?

Imagine if you were a Syrian refugee. You lived in a relatively prosperous country. Syria, before the war, was more prosperous than many European countries. It was basically somewhere in the middle between ""Poor and rich"". It wasn't Norwegian Oil Rich, but it wasn't Belarussian Dictatorship Poor either.

Then came the war. After living for years and years under the imminent threat of death for simply being in the wrong place at the wrong time, you flee the only home you've known and go to another country, originally planning on only staying there for maybe a few months, hoping against hope that the situation in your home country will have calmed down enough for you to return to rebuild it. Months become seasons, seasons become years, years become decades.

You're still unable to return to what you will always think of as your First Home. The country is in shambles. The only thing you still have with you (because you had to leave everything behind) to remind you of your First Home is the cultural norms that permeated that First Home that you still practice.

Now, please name 10 cultural norms immigrants refuse to assimilate that somehow hurts someone else. They have be anything, from ""Wearing hijabs"" to ""Not celebrating Christmas"". And if you as much as breathe ""Halal"", I shall write another essay on just how wrong you are and also ask you why the Hell you're not complaining about Kosher.",1447476124,"it was basically somewhere in the middle between ""poor and rich"".","poor and rich","rich",NA,FALSE,"poor and rich","poor",NA,NA,0
"cwsy1ci","&gt; Genius and big bucks don't necessarily go together. I don't see Peter as a guy with the interpersonal skills to run a company, or even the desire to do it.

I agree about the big bucks, but at the same time I don't see Peter constantly struggling as being realistic either.  I see him being middle class, but working hard to get there.  Or even just having a successful business or lab or what have you.

There's a thing about people that grew up as nerds in their teens going into their 20s and 30s, similar to Peter, and is that many of them tend to figure out how to be socially adjusted.

I find myself in sort of a similar situation to be honest.  I was a shy nerd growing up, I grew out of that while still remaining a nerd, but have become very much socially adjusted.  In science, you struggle in your 20s and then make a decent buck once you're out of grad school.  You're not necessarily rich (especially if you're a postdoc) but you're not in bad shape as others.

To be honest, the constant stories of his dating woes in his 20s and not having a stable position is tiring.  You don't get rich, but small increments of success do build up after mountains of failures.  Peter's entitled to that by now, and I wish the stories would work out that way.",1446999861,"you don't get rich, but small increments of success do build up after mountains of failures.","rich, but small","rich","but",TRUE,"rich , but small","small",NA,NA,1
"cwss2zc","&gt; Well... according to this the Czech Republic is the most decadent country in the world.

I wasn't talking about decadence. We are all decadent when we have access to things. CZ is a good example, look at your govt, look at your people you lot have a sense of identity that has been lost in the west by globalisation and ""free trade"" and capitalism.


&gt;Anyway, it has been proven that communist countries just aren't competitive against capitalists. Just looks at the difference between East- and West Germany. While the east is more conservative (but less religious - about the only good thing), it is also much less economically and culturally developed.


The DDR objectively had a higher standard of living (less rich but less poverty than the west which is what matters) and is shitty now because it got raped after the wall came down. Factories sold off for 5DM, all industry lost and everyone went where the jobs were.


Competitiveness is something about global trade and money. Money is to buy things, if you have things you don't need money and the state apparatus can do trade with other nations. Yes, things have to be expropriated to make the viable and the rich do suffer but rich people get rich by using poor people so it's basically payment of a tax.


&gt;Czech literature is also a good example of this. Between 1948 and 1989 many valuable books were written by emigrants (such as Josef Škvorecký), the only allowed style in communist countries was ""socialist realism,"" which was pretty much just communist propaganda.

I dislike socialist realism art but I have to say that some kind of control on media and information is good, when its a free for all you get situations like we have now where all matter of degeneracy and filth is available to the masses who are mostly too stupid to discern this is harmful.

"cw9cqr1","What if we tried it out by doing theme-restricted posts?  E.g., all bad econ posted next week has to be bad micro, bad methodology, bad game theory.

We could make November a the month of themes with either themed days or themed weeks (days could get obscenely specific, but weeks could get prohibitively broad), and this would give us the opportunity to both encourage study of fields a user might not previously be familiar with, or to approach existing questions from a whole new light.  For instance, the use of markov chains to show convergence of income of poorer countries to income of richer countries to combat the persistent ""rich getting richer, poor getting poorer"" meme.

IQ is partly genetic (but not along racial lines,  there's no evidence for differences of IQS among different races) but also negatively affected by poverty.   Differences in IQS between two populations is typically due to economic status and how IQ is measured.

This is part of the biggest problems our country faces right now.

The point I am trying to make is that yeah, for many groups that type of life, with a thriving middle class and a ""stay at home wife"" ""several children"" and a honest to goodness hard workin daddy is *real* great for some people, but its a fucking disaster for others. 

Women were constantly subject to be servants in a misogynistic fraternal society, black americans were (still are in many cases) treated entirely as second class citizens, gays had virtually no chance of fitting in with society so they were forced to stay completely secretive... basically anyone *other* than white males (which I am going to address in your other explanation below) suffered in the kind of system you are describing. Now one could make the argument that ""If we raise up the middle class, then all corners of society will benefit, women, white, black, whatever..."" and then I would argue that that kind of thinking fundamentally doesn't address the problem, but instead dismisses it (re: Black Lives Matter).

"cu5h5gy","This happened a few years ago.

I helped an old couple up the street by walking their dogs a couple times a week for exercise, as they could no longer do it themselves.

The couple had issues, but growing up in the time period they did, divorce was never considered. But they essentially were roommates with separate bedrooms.

About a year and a half ago the old man passed away. In the ensuing months the discovered all sorts of treasures that he had hidden away as they cleaned his stuff out of the house. A collection of old coins here, collectable guns there, nothing to make the widow rich but more than she ever imagined would be there.

A few months later I go in and the place is a disaster. The old lady was crying in a corner. I was immediately alarmed and asked what was happening. She calmed down and told me this story:

Her daughter, who lives three hours away, had shown up in a complete panic a few hours earlier. She had been in the grocery store that morning, doing what she routinely did, when she was approached by an apprehensive young woman. The woman was nervous, and apologetic. She said ""Excuse me ma'am... I am so sorry to bother you, I know you will think I'm crazy but I can't not tell you. I am a bit of a psychic, I don't like it, but I have to tell you. I can see a spirit of an old man. He has been following you for 10 minutes and he is trying to get your attention. He says he is very sorry for how he treated you as you were growing up. He says he always loved you. He also says there is something very important to him hidden behind a secret panel in his bedroom.""

Now the old man had indeed been very questionable in his parenting decisions when she was growing up, leading her to be mostly borderline estranged from the family. But in the few months since he had passed she had become much closer to her mother.

And she believes in paranormal things. 

So she had ransacked the house looking for a ""secret panel"" but did not find anything.

A few weeks later the widow had a construction crew come over to redo the bedroom, knock down a wall and redo the hardwood floors. she had jokingly told them to watch out for a secret panel. I walk in and she was beyond livid.

Turns out the crew indeed found a false wall in the back of his closet. You had to peel away the wallpaper, and when you did there was a handle and latch. When in place it was almost invisible. It was genius.

The crew called her in, figuring whatever was back there was hers and did not want to be accused of stealing anything. She opened the panel and found his stash of porn magazines.

For weeks ""THAT'S WHAT YOU COME BACK FROM THE DEAD FOR?! To save your  filthy *PORN*?!?!""

I laughed my balls off, but it hit me how creepy it was.

"ctsqqis","&gt;Windows 10, I think, is a great middle ground where now people can opt to use it more like a tablet interface - or a more mouse/keyboard option.

My biggest problem is now they're alienating their tablet market. We have a desktop and 8"" tablet in my house and while I really don't have many complaints about the desktop version the tablet mode leaves a lot to be desired. During Windows 8's lifespan there were a whole lot of 7 and 8 inch devices brought to market. Now that Edge browser is basically a desktop app (even in tablet mode) it's harder to maneuver. They've removed almost all of the gestures from Windows 8, so you can't swipe to go forward or backwards on a webpage anymore and instead have to hit this tiny arrow. Even on larger devices like Surfaces it's still hard to do because the resolution is higher than the small devices, essentially rendering the buttons the same physical size. Skype no longer has a metro app and just points you to install the desktop app, which is more feature rich, but harder to navigate on a touchscreen. I really would have preferred it if they either gave people the option of the Start menu in Windows 8 or kept the touchscreen UI for Windows 10's tablet mode. To me, Windows 10 is a step back simply to appease the desktop users and is leaving the touchscreen users out to dry. Of course, Windows 10 is still brand new and will likely refine it's interface.

"csrb1xu","So, onto the next bit.  The following is simply not true:

&gt; The primary behavioural purpose for serotonin appears to be realizing this nature across many biological systems.

Serotonin is *all over the brain*, and involved in *widely varied processes* as a result.  The fact that it drives yawning doesn’t suggest that its primary role is to influence the yawning reflex.  The number and variation of serotonin receptors is staggering, and the response they’re driving ranges from excitatory, inhibitory, metabotropic, and modulatory for the release of other neurotransmitters.  Basically, what I’m saying is that it isn’t really news that it would also play a role in aggression, because it plays a role *in nearly everything brain-derived*.  Also, I’m not entirely certain what the point of demonstrating a role of serotonin in aggression is, relative to what we’re talking about.           

Social hierarchies aren’t universal, and egalitarianism has stably been practiced in other cultures, which was the point of the previous post.  That hierarchies also exist doesn’t wipe that out.  

The first study is looking at whether women prefer someone who’s taken power by being an asshole, or someone who attained it by peer recognition.  It’s not really helpful here, imo, because it’s not looking at whether women will in general seek high prestige targets.  But the reality is this: prestige is highly context-driven.  For example, I value intelligence, and don’t value athletic prowess.  A famous, rich, but dumb sportsball guy is of little use to me.  He’ll gain no quarter, since what allocated prestige to him isn’t interesting to me.  Groupies may throw themselves at rock stars, but wouldn’t for famous attorneys, and so on.  What’s denotes value differs from person to person.  So we’re back to what I said in my last post: people in general want to be with people they respect, but there’s no recipe for what makes that determination.    

I don’t know what you mean by “strictly endocrinology sense” at all, even with the parenthetical statement, but either way, you’re still talking about that first paper, and none of the three studies they conducted found that women prefer dominant men; they all went in the opposite direction.

The next paper literally has nothing to do with what we’re discussing.  It speaks to using light touch in persuasion.  The paper after that is the exact paper that your first paper was disproved the findings of.  The next paper isn’t a paper, but either way, it shows that unattached women rate sluttier looking guys as desirable during ovulation, and it contains disproven claims that women prefer very masculine looking men.  Your final study goes against your claims here.  Not only did women not rate “dominant” men higher, they significantly preferred more feminine faces and voices on men who were bigger.  The stats in the last study, btw, were difficult to comprehend, so maybe you just missed that somehow?  It’s rare for 3d modeling techniques off of eignevalues to be used.

What are you even trying to show here again?

&gt; men are socially pressured to refrain from practicing polygyny

Why do you want extra spouses?  If you want a harem, don’t marry?  Society is actually ok with that.

&gt; That humans will have evolved within an environment encouraging hierarchy is found throughout the field of neuroscience and behavioural endocrinology, so to say women could not possibly have adaptational traits regarding hierarchy is unreasonable.

You supplied neither neuroscience links nor endocrinology links, and neither of those fields really address this topic anyway.  I mean, there are researchers who look at behavioral outcomes given certain parameters, but that’s not addressing the “evolution” per se.  Also, I didn’t say that women can’t have traits that help them deal with hierarchies, I said that arguing for one or more genes that encourage women to “marry up”, particularly when women didn’t even get to select their spouse until recently, is ludicrous.

"csr5zc6","5: Investments. The intertangled web of problems described above could be eased if someone else would sustain us for years while we would jump over the stairs, trying to reach new self-sustaining stages of variety, quantity and development. But we cannot ask Mars and Venus to invest into Earth. So what is left is war. Rob your neighbour with war and invest your tropheys into self-development, right ? No. Typically your neighbours were developing at nearly the same rate as you, so they would give you a strong fight, the fight that would make your victory largely pyrrhic. No matter how much would you rob the looser - it would not be much more than you spent on that war. So how then can you invest into yourself by wars? Colonization is the answer. You need to find someone weak enough that you can occupy him without much of effort. Some... ahem... savage. Well, but that savage still should have something valueable. You can rob all the sand in some desert - but it would be not be a good investment into your industries and science. So you need to (1) find a weak savage you can easily occupy without spending a lot (2) but not just any savage fits - that savage should have some raw resources that can be sucked into your industries (3) and transporting those resources from your colonies as well as transporting your military supplies into the colonies should be profiting. Well, this require quite an advanced logistics, you know... When you can send a little fleet across the ocean just for a slim chance ""there is something valuable"". Before you have already pre-developed logistics and naval science and ship-building - you just cannot do it. And before our economy is strong enough to have surplus richness you can just gamble upon ""maybe they would find something there"" - you cannot do it too.

The first vast colonization was the Conquista, Spaniards coming to America. They were not the first to reach American shores, but they were first who done it as an intentional planned effort of the whole society. Well, they also sucked gold back into their metropolis. It was a failure. Instead of sucking the resources that would fuel their industries, they sucked end-result that inhibited it. Spain quickly was transforming into most rich but most weak state of Europe.

Next attempt was by UK. They got economics advanced enough to build the fleet challenging Spanish one. And when Spane lost, they had to make some use of that huge fleet they built. So they started their own wave of colonization. They did it right. They robbed Far East in the way that more benefitted their industries and development, than hampered them. Sure, some gold and jewels from India too, but mostly the things you can sell to every household, things that you can base you next-gen medicine upon, etc. UK skyrocketed leaving mainland Europe far behind. But to be able to do it - UK had to develop advanced naval warfare, advanced logistics, and advanced understanding of economics to avoid failing into Conquista trap. And all that should have been developed in the pre-colonization times, in much slower ""prev-gen"" economics.

Now last thing to suggest is for you to take some economics simulator and just play into it. OpenTTD with Siberia scenario, or Civilization (or FreeCiv) - it can give you a gist how terribly weak and slow your starting is, and how overwhelmingly fast and events-rich is the future. They are very simplifying the real life, but even then can give you a feel of how painfully slow that development of the civilization starts, and how multiple seemingly unrelated effects are coming together into one river.

All the problems I told about are not isolated artifacts. They actually are multiplicating and effecting one another. In the beginning you just cannot solve none of them because you have no resources to do it. You really have to spend centuries just accumulating surplus just to solve one little problem. Then suddenly you have a lot of resources, but you just are not fast enough to find the places where to apply them before it all crashes and burns. :-)",1435944528,"spain quickly was transforming into most rich but most weak state of europe.","rich but most","rich","but",FALSE,"most rich but most weak","weak","most","most",1

There's also over the phone services that will translate for you (put the phone on speaker between you and the client).  I also have a couple translators (english and tagalog) who I can call to come in. 


THis is some advice I gave someone else, copy/ pasted. If you have any questions feel free to ask.  I'm not rich, but happy with a good work/ life balance.  

I basically stumbled into wage/ hour. When I started lawschool I wanted to practice consumer protection (because fuck predatory financial institutions). During 1L I met an employment law professor at my school's legal clinic, and she convinced me to take her clinical skills class my 1L summer. After two weeks I was hooked on employment law, and never thought of changing to something else.
I got to where I am now by just diving into employment law full on. I put way, way, way more effort into the clinic than I needed to if all I wanted was a grade. I took all the clinic classes, volunteered for extra cases and extra time during those classes, then volunteered at the clinic (doing same thing as in the classes) after I had taken all the classes they offered. I also took all the employment law related classes in normal law school (heavy on the civ pro). I had one employment law internship at a firm, but it was a complete waste of my fucking time, the clinic was where it was at.


I got my job offers from volunteer attorneys who supervise the law students when the law students work with clients. The attorneys saw that I cared more, and worked harder. They also thought I was naturally more talented at employment law than other students, but really I just worked more to prepare, so it looked like I was smarter than I actually am.


My best friend from lawschool got to the same place as me, by doing the exact same thing but with consumer protection. take consumer protection classes to, they're worthwhile for many reasons.


My advice would be this. Work twice as hard as everyone else. Focus your work on real cases, not moot court bullshit. Having a couple A's on your report card are nice, having a quarter mil in favorable judgments is better.


Also, treat your clients like human beings, not just like clients. It's easy to forget that these are people coming to you for help during one of the worst moments of their lives. It's easy to get impatient, get frustrated when they don't answer your questions properly, or do something stupid that you wouldn't do. By definition, if you're a lawyer you're exceptional. Our clients flip burgers, deliver packages, or change diapers because that might be all they are capable of doing. Keep your heart in the right place, don't aim for maximum efficiency, and be kind. They'll remember your kindness far more than the court's decision (and for the self-interested reason, this is what generates referrals which is how you make the money).

Yes, money is tighter.

This is completely untrue. If your company paid you to type up some documents and you could normally type 100 copies per day, should you get a massive pay increase when the company buys a photocopier that allows you to make 500 copies per day?

If you were paid to dig ditches and you could dig 2 ditches per day, should you get a pay increase when the company invests in a steamshovel that allowed you to dig 20 ditches per day?

What about machinery used for auto production?

The simple fact is that your labor rate is not tied to production. It's tied to the market rate for your position.

Now you're trying to play the lame race card. Nobody is going to feel sorry for you when you do this. It just makes you sound like a hater.

I'm not rich, but I worked my way up until I could live a very comfortable life. I worked for my things. I own a house and 5 cars. I work on them myself to save money, and I also work on my own house to save money. I did my best to avoid being in the renter class.

I did things the old fashioned way. While everyone else was telling me that they ""got with the times"" to do things the ""modern"" way (which is to rent or lease, to pay someone else to do your work for you, to buy things on credit),  I worked hard to own all my own things. I don't rent a house, I own a house. I don't pay mechanics, I work on my own cars, with my own tools, in my own garage. I don't pay a contractor, I work on my own house. I save a TON of money doing this while the people who paid for things they don't own on credit are now struggling to pay off their previous purchases. Meanwhile I'm sitting pretty with skills needed to maintain my own things with tools that I own outright.

Now 10 years later I feel like I've built a substantial lead over many of the people who argued with me. My mortgage is about as much as their rent, only my house is much larger and I'm going to own it outright soon. Then, my kids will be able to inherit a house for free and they won't be stuck paying for something for 30 years, and they'll have vehicles to drive that they don't have to pay for.

If you're feeling up for a laugh go on any top babypips or forexfactory strategy thread and ask for proof in the form of a account statement or verified myfxbook account. I promise you you'll get every excuse under the sun but no evidence of trading success!

Harsh reality is that FX can make some people money, it will make some people rich but most of us won't make a penny in the long run. 

All you can do is read up on what moves the markets.

The only profitable strategy I have used is reading up on national bank statements when they come out to get an idea of where the currency will go long term and then looking to catch weekly moves in that direction by getting a trade in on a Monday or Tuesday and closing on a Thursday or Friday.  Then making an entry by using support and resistance, higher highs and higher lows.


Read national bank statements then put the key terms read up on investopedia how what they plan on doing will impact trading. Like quantive easing or interest rate adjustments etc.

"crkkrd7","[Translation (by: [@ddeulgichu](https://twitter.com/ddeulgichu)] **150526 Message FROM JOY: After reading the book, ""Momo""**

Hello everyone~~ are you all doing well??

Promotions have finished and I'm living leisurely nowㅎㅎ

The reason that I'm writing a post today is because

I read a book recently that healed my impatient and uneasy heart &gt;&lt;

That's why I'm going to write a book report for people who constantly have busy lives and are going 
through hard timesㅎㅎㅎ

The book I read is called, 'Momo'.

You can't tell what the book is about by just seeing the title, right?

Me either. That made me even more curious, so I ended up reading it.

It's a very beautiful and pure fairy tale.

If I were to explain it briefly by summarizing,

although the mysterious/unidentified girl doesn't know her parents, where she was born,or her birthday,
Momo has a special ability to listen to people's stories really well.

It's a story about finding time that the bad Men in Gray stole and are stealing.

Everyone, what do you think about valuing time?
Waking up at dawn, having no time to eat, working and studying mindlessly.

Until recently, I thought that this lifestyle

was a necessary process to become a great person of the future.

However in this book, the poor yet kind people who helped each other
start conserving their time and lose their joy and laughter in life.

Suddenly, the once warm and peaceful village changes to where the people have no emotions and work like a machine;
they don't care about one another and the world becomes cold and gray.

Although they become rich by valuing their time, their hearts become endlessly poor.

It really is a perfect example of being rich but poor on the inside.

A life where you have a lot but aren't satisfied, and a life where you don't have much but are thankful for all that you have.
Which life is happier??

From now on, with a thankful heart,

I'm going to cherish everything that I have been given!!

When my mind becomes impatient, I'm unable to do anything.

I keep having negative thoughts and feel pathetic/pitiful for not being able to accomplish or do things quickly.

When this situation is repeated, I have trauma and new challenges scare me greatly.

There was one phrase that really really touched me that the turtle Cassiopeia said to a rushed and insecure Momo.

""Going slow is faster"".

After reading that contradictory phrase I spaced out for awhile.

But then after receiving a great amount of comfort [from the phrase] I smiled.
Don't look too far ahead and have a difficult time.

If you just walk your own path step by step, before you know it, you'll arrive at your destination!!

If it gets to be too difficult, have something like ""tea time for me""
or listen to good songs and fill yourself with strength.

Take care of people around you and let's run forward while laughing!!!!

I was deeply moved after reading this book last night so I ended up writing the rest of the post like thisㅎㅎ

Everyone, have strength♥^^
Going slow is faster!!!!!!
AjaAjaAja~~!! (T/L Note: this is just another way to say fighting)

"cqr5lbz","I might have some insight, I'm not an Ivy League grad, but my wife is. I went to a state university, and eventually ended up in a top tier grad program. I have a bit of a different perspective though, and I think this comes from having been on the outside and no having peaked behind the curtain. 

Hands down, across the board, every single person I've met from either the undergrad program she went to, or the med school she was at, they are all amazing people. Not just in the, ""smart and can solve crazy math,"" kind of way. There are plenty of those people everywhere. No, what sets them apart is their general overall ability to be high-functioning across the board. Every single one of them is amazing and excels in their academic pursuits, or now their careers, but what is really impressive is how they are also amazing at tons of other things. 

I met one guy, he had been to law school, was a guitar player in a band (this is in Nashville, so, not sure if you know the scene there, but nothing but amazing musicians) and able to support his family playing music before he decided to go back and get a med degree. Another guy, he had taken a year off between undergrad and grad school, he went to Vegas and played poker professionally. Supported himself with the winnings he banked. Another guy, he had competed in professional body building competitions, so you can see, they don't just dedicate and excel at one thing ... everything they do, they apply that same level of dedication and drive to.

*This* is why they are successful. It's not because they are rich, it's not because their parents got them in to the program, because plenty of them were first generation Ivy League and from normal families. Even my wife, her parents not rich, she's first gen, so I guess in a lot of ways before meeting her I'd had misconceptions about that environment too. It was totally not what I expected at all, and I think there are a lot of assumptions people make when they hear you are an Ivy League grad.

But, yes, you do meet some that fall into that other side of the spectrum. You also have to think, my wife is a really nice girl, so she isn't going to hang out with people that are not good people. There are *plenty* of assholes, and I met a few at parties. Probably the worst though is she'd tell me stories of how during undergrad lots of people would refuse to help others out, because they didn't want to upset their chance of being as high ranked as possible or whatever. Which is strange, because at all my programs we would all work together to get things done. Even in the work place collaboration is the norm. Hell, even as an engineer, as you move up, it isn't about what you know, it's about how you work with people and how you can work as a team to get things done. This is the way the world works, but at her program she said if she went to a roommate who was taking the same class to ask for help on a physics problem set, they'd get pissy and flat out refuse to help her. So yup, there are definitely some A-type gunners who are complete assholes. However, I'd say they are probably the exception, because I knew the majority of her med class and for the most part they were all awesome people.

Now, do I think that maybe some people out there would do a lot better if they grew up in a different environment, had more positive role models, and were given the same encouragement and opportunities afforded to others? Fuck ya, of course. I think this is absolutely true for many people, even those that are in the middle ground, not even in horrible situations. How many people, if there was a strong role model at the right time that they looked up to, encouraged them, and pushed them to try harder, maybe they could have applied themselves to do better in the last couple years of HS and gotten better SAT and GPA. Maybe they'd had ended up in a better university, or maybe with more scholarships. So ya, it's not just that these people are amazing and hard working, but there is definitely the fact that a lot of things came together to make their success possible. 

In the end though, for all of those that are amazing people with the most impressive work ethics ever and made it that far having been given opportunity and environments because their parents knew how important that was, there is an almost limitless pool of entitled, lazy, brats that squander the opportunities and advantages that are given to them. Despite having a trust fund, despite having parents who were the hard working, A-type, high-functioning successful types, their kids grow up entitled and living extravagant lives beyond their capability to sustain without their parents. They have a lifestyle they are accustomed to, and they don't want to work for it. They live on a net negative budget, and eventually what was given to them, they leave even less to their kids, or maybe nothing at all ... They think they are rich, but really, only rich because they had parents who were the amazing ones. People like that are a dime a dozen, and honestly, I think these are the people that a lot out there associate with the ""rich and privileged,"" and they associate Ivy League with, ""rich.""

"cpwfoz9","I honestly don't get people doing this.   Both bodybuilding and supercars require huge commitments that it is incredibly obvious you aren't doing.  My brother spends like 2 hrs at the gym 7 days a week, has fitness websites, supplements, and emails non stop.   And he looks nothing like a bodybuilder, because that takes as much work as a full time job.   If you ever see someone anywhere besides the gym or work, and they don't relate everything anyone says to bodybuilding, they don't look like that.(no offense to anyone into it, but the level of commitment it takes means that it tends to be your main point of reference.)

 If they have ever gone a whole day without posting their lift routines, supplements, and a new intensive four week diet and exercise routine it's an obvious lie.

Supercars are also huge parts of your life.   You can't ""just"" be able to afford a 300k-1m vehicle, you need regular access to a track, you need to buy it 50k in tires a year, and to afford the insurance which is through the roof.   You also need driving school at least once, because they don't drive like a regular vehicle.   Even for the ultra wealthy it's a massive commitment and lifestyle choice.   Most of them are even limited production runs that sell out well in advance, so just being rich won't get you the car, you have to have connections in the car world.

"cpwf4i3","If you want a girl who is in the top % of SMV and RMV - aka a good quality 9+, then why is it any surprise you have to be a 10 yourself? 

You attract what you are. I would argue this guy is a 3 or a 4, NOT a 7-8. You are assuming because he has good looks that he is a 7-8, but girls do not value looks as we value looks. These two are perfectly matched - on the scale of beta to alpha in terms of personality and qualitative metrics, this guy is LOW. 

If you are rich but beta, or rich and handsome but beta as fuck, you are still going to get BETA RESULTS. A male feminist, the lowest of the low, is simply not going to be fucking the hot club chicks who go for top tier guys who also have an RP frame. 

You are evaluating the market via looks and coming to the correct conclusion that attractive guys date and wife ugly girls. That is not a incorrect observation at all, but what you're missing is that these attractive guys can still be 2s or 3s. 

You need to be RP as fuck if you aren't rolling in money / power / status / model looks, and even if you have the latter, you need at least SOME RP to get good results. 

Make no mistake - people do not date too far from their own value. If an ugly ass dude is dating a model, I guarantee you he's a 10 in other departments. If a good looking guy is dating a 5, I guarantee you he's a 1 in other departments. Girls hook up with guys with higher SMV, and allow guys with similar SMV to court them and get on the delayed-sex train occasionally, and use lower SMV guys for validation / orbiting. If a guy is in a BB type relationship with a landwhale, they there is something repulsive, something pathetic about him that's dragging down his SMV. And when you investigated this ""model 7-8"" guy, you found it - he is a mangina. Being a male feminist in a woman's eyes takes you from 100 to 0 real quick.

"cpqjs4w","What!?

**Quality**, which is essentially land value, is based on leisure/services/etc:
Low == Level 1
High == Level 5

Zoning **density** is completely controlled by the player:
Low == House
High == Tower

**Demand** is the RCI in the bottom of your screen.

How **tall/large** the building can be is controlled by how large the zoned grid is; 1x1 up to 4x4.


&gt;There is an assumption behind Cities that is completely unreallistic, and that is that size equals quality

I've never assumed that. I'd say, Level 3 High-density residential is the tallest, it shirks at Level 4 then suddenly jumps at Level 5.


&gt;There is no such thing as a high-density, low-quality building


Zone 4x4 high-density residential in an area with little police/fire/leisure/garbage/water coverage.


&gt;there is no such thing as a rich but relatively small building


Zone 1x1 low-density residental in an area with good coverage of police/fire/leisure/etc.


Just because the graphic designer made tenemens bright and pretty doesn't make it any less of a shitty high-rise. 
Just because the graphic designer made Level 1 low-density houses look nice doesn't change the fact that it is essentially the worst type of place to live. 
But this issue is a purely graphical one that is easily remedied by a graphic mod.


&gt;People don't build higher because they're happy and rich, they build higher because the demand for space is high.


Demand is the RCI bars. If anything, you are asking for something like neighborhood-based-demand instead of what we have now which is overall-city-demand. I can imagine this being implemented using ingame Districts. 

Building higher is completely up to you and depends solely on whether you zone low-density or high-density.

IRL, very few people build their own homes/towers. You live in what's available...unless you're multi-millionaire rich.


The real issue is the number of households in each of the buildings. A Level 5 low-density house shouldn't house 7 households. A Level 1 high-density building shouldn't only house 8 households. But ya know what? [There's a mod for that](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=410344523&amp;searchtext=population).


However, I do agree that there could be an Income Variable to the simulation in the game, or rather, make it more prominent and affecting. Then you could separate quality from land value.

**1. Change RCI-demand to District-wide from City-wide.**


**2. Do something with income.**

Basically, when your business grows to have a lot of employees, you stop working your original job and move more into the business side of it]), they won't be famous. Entertainment is basically the only work where you can get relatively rich and famous. Astronauts get relatively famous, but not very rich. CEO's get relatively rich, but not very famous.

And also, if you are smart and work hard, you can most definitely get very rich from it. The only problem is coming up with the ideas and having the money to fund it.

"cox8iyz","Nah, it's just a defense mechanism. I received my MD and PhD from Harvard before the age of 30. I made 600k a year at one point. And then one day I realized why I felt so empty inside. I wasted my entire youth on something I wasn't even that passionate about. From then on, I have travelled to more than 50 countries across the globe and plan on seeing far more before my journey here is done.  
You'd be surprised how cheap travelling is but what you get in return is 10 times the reward than what money and iphone's/new cars can give you. You interact with people of varying cultures. You learn more about yourself rather than being a 8 to 5 zombie. You experience things that make you feel alive. Trust me, the moment you stop feeding yourself lies and justifying your current life style, that's the moment you truly awaken. I'm sure you're thinking well yeah but you're a doctor and you make money to travel. Nope. I work at little at cafes, zoo's, farms and here and there take care of patients (usually for free) and that's enough to let me travel. Don't make it an obligation to live. ""I have to do this and that to uphold my reputation."" ""People will think I'm weird if i quit my job to pursue a passion."" If you're married with kids then yeah its probably a big harder. I was fortunate enough to marry someone with the same mentality as me. She had a very well paying office job but quit to pursue her career in arts. This motivated me to do the same and now we travel and she does art while I dabble in my varying passions. If we had kids, I don't think it would be much different. Some kids might prefer a bit more stability when it comes to making friends but it's really just those teenage years and then they're off on their own adventure to pursue their own passions. That's how it goes. Live for yourself and those that care for you will truly begin to appreciate you. Anyhow, just thought I'd throw in some advice considering I was that same person saying that my degree and my workplace defined me. People knew me as Doctor blah blah but not for who I really was and I sure as hell was not going to spend the rest of my life living a lie.

I'd love to hear your thoughts. My mind is open and I welcome your thoughts.

&gt; It's not very fair of you to ascribe attitudes to those who disagree with you, especially when done in such a loaded fashion.

I apologize, I was not referring to *anyone* who disagrees with me, but there is a panty-pooping faction who clamor to stories like this, screaming that the sky will surely fall, even though it never has before across the hundreds of instances of minimum wage being raised.

&gt; You're essentially saying that those of us who disagree are evil.

That wasn't my intention. Not *all* of those arguing against minimum wage increases are evil, but in fairness, 100% of those who are evil oppose minimum wage.

&gt; Who else would say the ""poor are too rich""? Seriously?

It depends on your definitions of poor and rich, but the short answer is Republicans. People aren't poor, 98% of them have a refrigerator! So six million American's don't even have a refrigerator. Saying that this is a sufficient condition for not being poor is simply absurd.

"cn686ni","Yes, I am! I moved across the country with my son, who is now three. I knew that if I stayed I'd never shake myself of him. I never got closure, and that bugs me sometimes. But as I get over my anxiety and begin growing my self-confidence, I find myself caring less and less *why* he did everything he did. I get lonely sometimes, but not nearly as lonely as I was when I was with him. And I miss him sometimes. But I've realized that I don't actually miss him, I miss who I thought he was.

I struggle with our child, though. He is the spitting image of his father, and sometimes its hard to look at him without thinking of my ex.

"cm5qpsv","Interesting point. In my view government, while corrupted, is still much more democratic than the completely non democratic economy. Reforms can be pushed, and good ones too. I get a bit annoyed at this ""revolution versus reform' mentality, as in my view that distinction is not very strong. I think it comes with my earlier point that people view the status quo as a single system to be defeated, rather than being made up of so many different systems. 

You could have a revolutionary reform which completely replaces one of the other systems in society. An unlikely example, would be parliament removing copyright laws so suddenly no one could own and profit off ideas alone, or even more extreme abolishing laws that enforce private property in the economic sector, and replacing them with laws that say the people who work somewhere have ownership over that place. These would never happen with the current level of corruption of parliament by the rich, but other less extreme changes have.

To me, there are a few reforms that while now unlikely, are still plausible, and would be revolutionary to the socialist cause. Things like reducing working hours through high minimum wage and good welfare systems, heavy taxing of the rich, massive reforms to education etc all all things that are being discussed right now and within reach within one country or another, or have been recently. Unions are also another aspect to this. Next to this would be ignoring and fighting systems of repression where you can, protecting net neutrality and exposing government surveillance, supporting good movements, helping whistleblowers etc etc. 

I can't tell the future, and I'm not certain that socialism can occur without completely removing the current systems, however there certainly isn't any conclusive evidence to me that says that it requires a complete removal of every system.

"cm57w7f","I know I'm late to the party but I was thinking of running my own 'West Marches' game with 5e.  
I've been looking through the resources you posted and it's all very good and rich but I have to admit, a little daunting.  
Obviously there's a lot of different resources by a lot of different authors come from a lot of different back grounds and with somewhat divergent objectives. How have you managed to integrate the materiel into a cohesive system?  
An example of what I mean. The Alexandrian obviously contributes a great deal mechanically but deals with 12 mile hexes.  
Given you've linked to the article about why Hexes aught to be 6 miles, I take it that's what you've done, but have you keyed encounter/locations more sparsely or do you just have a lot more going on per Mile^2 ? If the former have you opted for a bigger map than the 10x10 or 12x12 that The Alexandrian recommends? If so how big and were there any not so obvious consequences.  
Also, I started DnD with 4e and have only DMd 5e (currently running LMoP) I have to admit I havent worked through all the recommended reading yet but some of it seems over my head, perhaps it's cause I've not had a look at a DMG yet but it also occurs that it might be to do with edition variance. Being that you're running your 5e West Marches game already, what, if anything, have you had to do to integrate the resources you used with 5e? Is there any sage advice that you might offer for someone who's both a newbie DM and who doesn't have the breadth or depth of RPG experience you have?
Apologies for the Wall-O-Text ^TM and thanks in advance for any pearls of wisdom you can spare for this aspiring Master of the Wilds.

Back again with a favorite of mine. I recently said in this thread: http://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/2l4rus/scotland_was_destroyed/ that if Scotland was destroyed, I would stock up on Aberlour. 

This is why.

*Aberlour A'bunadh Batch #47, Non-chill filtered, 60.7% ABV* 

* **Colour:** Light red amber

* **Nose:** Rich sherry, dark chocolate, oak. Sweetness, apples, creamy toffee, almonds. 

* **Nose (water added):** Sweeter, more vanilla, lighter chocolate, crème brûlée, spicy. More mellow, the very slight harshness from the high ABV is gone. 

* **Palate:** Very flavourful and heavy without being unpleasant. Sherry, oranges, sweetness, marmelade, spiciness. 

* **Palate (water added):** Still rich but more fruity, cherries, dried apricots, honey. Slightly creamy. 

* **Finish:** Just keeps going. Oak, fruity, lingering caramel, some coffee notes.

**Summary:** Yum. Just amazing. It's definitely a sherry bomb but it still has a lot going on in it. I may describe it with sweet flavours, but it's not light sweetness, it's dark and intense.

**Score:** 94/100

If you go to the satellite towns around Glasgow which were set up to run factories/engineering toolshops/similar in the 1900-1950s you will see those towns have grand old buildings in the center and sprawling cheaply built suburbs all around.

I have the perfect metaphor for you : Detroit.  We have a whole ton of detroits because we started it 30-40 years before you. They've been there a long time and no one has done much about it. Those people don't even vote much normally - what's the point? Nothing changes; their votes don't alter the government in westminster. This time they are showing up in hundreds of thousands to vote. Why?

The reason is simple. Hope - that by a big change to the system, a better system can be developed. Scotland has a liberal history which means we're more likely to end up like somewhere such as Sweden or Norway, where the rich aren't quite so rich but there really aren't so many horribly deprived areas.

Here's a map of life expectancy for the UK showing how life expectancy drops between London and Glasgow. Green is dying old and rich and happy. Red is a shorter lifetime of grinding poverty and social problems that never get solved by any London government - the same problems your father and grandfather had and that your children will have if there is no change.

**[Does economic freedom alleviate poverty?](http://www.fee.org/the_freeman/detail/free-the-poor)**

March 07, 2014 by JULIAN ADORNEY

2014 marks the 50th anniversary of the War on Poverty, and many claim that President Johnson’s program has lifted millions out of poverty.  But if we really want to help the poor, research suggests that economic freedom does more than government aid.

**Economic Freedom Within the United States**

In “A Dynamic Analysis of Economic Freedom and Income Inequality in the 50 States: Empirical Evidence of a Parabolic Relationship,” Daniel L. Bennett and Richard K. Vedder argue that, past a certain point, economic freedom decreases inequality. Increasing economic freedom benefits the poor and middle class more than it helps the wealthy.

Bennett and Vedder analyze the 50 states in terms of their economic freedom and their income inequality over 25 years (from 1979 to 2004). Bennett and Vedder define economic freedom as more or less the degree to which government is limited. They measured and ranked states according to the size of government, the level of taxation, and the level of labor market regulation. They define income inequality using the Gini coefficient. Because different states have radically different levels of economic freedom (compare New York and North Dakota, for instance), the authors were able to draw on a wealth of data about relative economic freedom in 50 distinct economies.

The authors find a parabolic relationship between a state’s economic freedom and its income inequality. As states initially become more economically free, most of the gains go to the wealthy. But at a certain inflection point X, which 21 states had already hit by 2004, the relationship shifts: past this point, as states become more free, income inequality declines.

But does income inequality decline because the rich lose wealth (perhaps through fewer opportunities for crony capitalism), or because the gains from increasing economic freedom go primarily to the poor?  In “Income Inequality and Economic Freedom in the U.S. States,” Nathan J. Ashby and Russell S. Sobel find that it’s the latter.

Ashby and Sobel analyze the 48 states of the continental United States in terms of their economic freedom and the incomes of their poor, middle-class, and wealthy residents over 20 years (from the early 1980s to the early 2000s). They use the same measure of economic freedom as Bennett and Vedder. 

**The authors find a strong positive correlation between a state’s economic freedom and the income level of the poorest 20 percent of residents. Freer states did better by their poor than less free ones. In particular, Ashby and Sobel found that increasing the economic freedom of a state by one unit (equivalent to moving from 40th-freest state to 7thfreest-state) increased the incomes of its poorest residents by 11 percent. By contrast, the same change increased the incomes of the richest quintile by just over a third of that (4.3 percent). The middle class also saw increases, greater than the rich but less than the poor. Increasing a state's economic freedom by reducing taxation and regulation creates broadly shared prosperity across all quintiles. Their research helps explain why, as states become more economically free, their income inequality declines: The poor and the middle class see more gains than the wealthy.**

But couldn’t this be a case of mistaken causality? Maybe some states have less poverty because they have more natural resources. With less poverty, they need less government to help the poor, meaning they’re economically freer. But Ashby and Sobel anticipated this claim. They control for about a dozen variables, including education, geography, and median income. The last controlled variable is especially important; it places richer and poorer states on a level playing field, so to speak, for the study. It combats the idea that perhaps wealthier states need less government because they have less poverty, and firmly points the arrow of causality toward economic freedom reducing poverty.

Ashby and Sobel’s research is a compelling argument against government poverty programs. Other research, for instance the Mercatus Center’s Freedom in the 50 States annual report, notes the positive effects of economic freedom on aggregate economic growth. But because their data is left in the aggregate, it’s difficult to determine to whom exactly the economic gains go. But by breaking down their research by quintile, Ashby and Sobel make a case that economic growth especially helps the poor.

**Economic Freedom Worldwide**

Nor is the connection between economic freedom and bottom-rung prosperity unique to the United States. Recent research in the Economic Freedom of the World (EFW) 2013 Annual Report finds the same trend internationally.

**The Economic Freedom of the World (EFW) Annual Report, published by the Fraser Institute, analyzes around 150 countries in terms of factors like their economic freedom, closeness to a laissez-faire state, poverty levels, and per capita income. The results are a striking indictment of the idea that more government intervention in the economy can help the poor.**

**As EFW points out, the shares of a country’s GDP going to the bottom 10 percent are pretty consistent regardless of how free the country is. From communist states to progressive countries to almost laissez-faire societies, the poorest 10 percent of citizens receive about 2.5 percent of the country’s wealth. No amount of progressive policies has changed that number. But for the poor, life is still much better in an economically free country than in one with more government. More economically free countries have more wealth than less free ones, meaning the poorest 10 percent can end up with thousands of dollars more per year. The poorest citizens of the 25 percent most-free countries earn an average of $10,556 per year. The poorest citizens in the middle 50 percent of countries earn less than a third of that.**

**So why does more economic freedom mean less poverty? The answers are well-known to libertarians, but worth reviewing. In societies with more economic freedom, decreased taxes and regulation make it easier to accumulate savings and to start or expand a business. Today in the United States, getting permits and navigating the legal maze to start a business can cost tens of thousands of dollars. Getting the permit for a food truck, and complying with the various laws, can cost $15,000 at the high end. Regulations in the United States overall cost about 1.5 percent of the country’s income per capita. But in other countries this cost is even higher; in Germany regulations sap 4.7 percent of the nation’s income per capita. In Italy it’s 14.2 percent.**

**Some of these regulations drain money from existing corporations, leaving them with fewer funds to expand; others impose hefty costs on anyone wishing to start a business. Both ultimately discourage wealth creation. Countries or states with more economic freedom therefore have more jobs, more innovation, and more goods and services—ultimately more wealth—than societies burdened by a heavy government.**

As we approach the 50th anniversary of the War on Poverty, legislators would do well to bear these data in mind. The cure for poverty is not more well-meaning government programs to make the United States resemble Europe. The solution, as it has always been, is more economic freedom.

"cjqvtr4","I'll skip the top 7 teams in terms of fanbase: Juve, Inter, Milan, Roma, Napoli, Lazio, Fiorentina. Here are some personalities:

Torino: the unluckiest club in the entire world. A rich, but very tragic history, beautiful shirts and a passionate local fanbase that eclipses that of their rivals in the city (but not outside of it). 

Past season saw them return to a bit of glory under Ventura with fast paced play and the most explosive duo in Serie A in Cerci and Immobile. The latter has left and the first might also, but their squad is still good and Quagliarella isn't a bad replacement by any means. As long as Darmian and Cerci are not yet sold, they look like they might replicate some of the success. Also play in the EL.

Parma: The best team outside of the top 7 last year. As far as history goes, they were a European superpower 15 years ago, but have lost a lot of that grandeur because of financial problems. 

However, things are a lot better than they were five years ago. On the financial side their renowned Parma model has certainly paid off to an extent and the club looks healthy, though the recent ban on co-ownership might affect their finances.

On the football side, their team is solid, with not that many truly outstanding players, but a really great collective. Their top man is notorious bad boy Cassano, whose raw talent is only eclipsed by his poor career decisions. However, you can and should expect magic from him. 

Hellas: A club finally back after years of absence that exploded onto the scene in fashion true to their reputation, with very attacking football. Their history includes one of the largest upsets in the history of Serie A with their Scudetto in 1985, but also an eleven year absence from the highest level until returning past year.

They are known for their very rabid, very right wing oriented fanbase who at the very least make sure the match isn't quiet by any means. The best time to see them in action is during the Verona derby woth city rivals Chievo, the smaller club from the city. 

They have lost some star players of their past season like Iturbe, Romulo and Jorginho and it will be very hard to replicate the success, but Mandorlini is a great manager and Toni will probably still look deadly as always.

Yes, it's true that remote resorts can be difficult to operate, but as others have pointed out, lots of people *like* remote resorts.  But see, Lanai is already a desert.

And on the inland portions, the windward side of the mountain has some green, but not a whole lot.  The leeward side, where the resort is located, is even *more* dry than the rest of the island.

"cjg3qyo","""If it's just one question, I'll want to get an exhaustive answer,"" I said, careful not to phrase my statement as a question.

""Exhaustive to a point,"" God replied.

""Wha--I mean, tell me what you mean by that.""

""You don't need to worry about me misinterpreting what your question is meant to be. I'm in your mind. Anyway, what I mean is that if you don't fully understand what I'm saying, you'll be able to ask more until you are satisfied with your answer, but only to a point. I'm not willing to go on tangents until you've answered for yourself every question you've ever had.""

I thought for a long time, although the question altogether seemed meaningless to me. What good would come from an answer I'd just forget?

I looked at God closely--or as closely as I could. He was pretty built, like old statues of Greek gods, his muscles perfectly proportioned and defined. His face, however, was difficult to look at. It just seemed like a shifting mix of features from people I'd known in my life, never quite blending into a complete face.

""I think I've got a pretty good one,"" I said. ""Or, anyway, it could be good.""

""It could also be terrible, depending on the answer,"" God said knowingly.

I briefly considered the life I was apparently now leaving. I had lived through a strangely varied set of life events. I had had tremendous luck and incredible, cataclysmic misfortune. I had learned a lot of economics and had become very rich, but different houses of mine had burnt down three times in my life; my nation was frequently embroiled in war but I was always safe and the draft always missed me; animals get riled up whenever I'm around, but their owners almost universally seem to like me (I've met a lot of girls when they felt the need to apologize for their angry dog). Apparently the bad luck had just won out, because a moment before this I was struck by lightning. After considering this, I decided my question was probably a good one.

""How was my life supposed to go?""

God chuckled, having known this was coming. ""You were supposed to ask out Anne in 8th grade,"" he said, ""not sophomore year in high school. She loved you all along, but if you had done it then, she would have said yes, not realizing how much her family would hate you. You would've become more important than her family to her, and when the time came, the two of you would've eloped, ditching both of your families and freewheeling for a couple years. You'd run out of gas while driving late at night, and you'd both walk out to find a gas station. Before you did you'd be attacked by a rabid dog, both of you bitten, and since you'd have no insurance, you would die of your disease at the age of 26.""

I was taken aback. ""I was supposed to die almost 15 years ago?""

""Yes, at the age of 26, hated by your family, without a penny to your name.""

""...But...why would you do that to me?""

""I hate mankind,"" he said.

My eyes bolted open as I suddenly understood. God had been trying to kill me for more than a decade. Every time I'd been saved by skills (social skills, economics knowledge) or technology (fucking dog leashes) or just simple luck (getting out of burning buildings, not working up the courage to ask out a girl)--apparently things out of God's control.

"cicwg5q","**Little Princess Sara 9-28:** It looks like I was right on the mark about the foreshadowing. With the sudden change in the tone of the show, I've been blown away by the quality of it. I'm just so surprised that I haven't heard anybody ever mention it outside of talking about WMT anime in general.

The core strength of the show lies in the characters. Well, mainly Sara. *Ace wo Nerae*'s Hiromi either just took bullying and felt somehow responsible for it, or she was ignoring the existence of it entirely. Sara has a lot of internal conflict regarding it, but outwardly takes all punishment she recieves. There's a moment earlier in the series where she imagines herself hitting Lavinia, then forgiving her. Hiromi didn't do any of that. 

The OST works well enough that I barely know it's there. Except for [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeP9n1_JLRk), which usually plays near the end of sad episodes. It gets my every time, even though I know it's coming.

One thing I find strange is that even though the series is centred around the suffering that Sara (and to a lesser extent, Becky) have to put up with, almost all the characters are fundamentally good. Good people, I mean. Not just those that were enchanted by Sara when she was rich, but random people on the street, too. All the people in the market, all the girls in the school (Lavinia aside). I suppose they're all like that just to show how despicable Miss Minchin and Lavinia are.

By then, anybody who doesn't want to *should* be able to move to Mars if they want to, or stay on Earth.  Anything less is just arrogant, supremacist genocidal laziness.  And there's still the question of, what about now?  What about everything before then, and in-between?  Your words resonate of utopia (only for the rich), but what about process?  Do you think the government should impose it on people, or is it their choice to be what they want, how they want, when they want and why they want it so long as it doesn't directly impinge on someone else's self-determination? Compassion is somewhat of a value, you know, as is the responsibility of social uplift.

But then shit like this comes along and all the rich privileged white ass holes donate $20 or some worthless amount to a rich girl with excellent health insurance and then when their government tells them they need to start paying extra taxes to help fund health care for the poor, they complain that they already give to sick people, they have a warped view in their head that tells them that the ""unfortunate"" are actually getting help, when they arent, his 6 figure salary boss's son who has lung cancer (probably from smoking), that kid is getting ""help"", despite his well off, or wealthy parents.

Christ calls the rich to share their wealth because it's His place to do so.  We should impart this value to our children as it is our duty to raise them, but it is not our place to demand this of anyone else.  It actually harms us, the person we demand action from, and the people we intend to help.

St. John Chrysostom puts it well here:

&gt; Should we look to kings and princes to put right the inequalities between rich and poor? Should we require soldiers to come and seize the rich person’s gold and distribute it among his destitute neighbors? Should we beg the emperor to impose a tax on the rich so great that it reduces them to the level of the poor and then to share the proceeds of that tax among everyone? Equality imposed by force would achieve nothing, and do much harm.

&gt;Those who combined both cruel hearts and sharp minds would soon find ways of making themselves rich again. Worse still, the rich whose gold was taken away would feel bitter and resentful; while the poor who received the gold form the hands of soldiers would feel no gratitude, because no generosity would have prompted the gift. Far from bringing moral benefit to society, it would actually do moral harm. Material justice cannot be accomplished by compulsion, a change of heart will not follow.

"cf9o2lm","Well it seems like you don't have an issue spending a little extra on skincare, which is helpful. Shoppers actually has some really great stuff in the Beauty Boutique/Cosmetics section, even in the tiny stores. My personal favourite dermatological brand they carry is Avene. They use thermal spring water, much like Vichy and La Roche-Posay, with the added bonus of not being owned by L'Oreal (and so are Lancome and Biotherm). The cynic in me appreciates that. They are owned by Pierre Fabre, if you're curious.

As I was without a job and the employee discount for a while, my current skincare routine is a big of a hodgepodge of different products (though now that I have steady employment again I'm back to gazing at Avene with big doe eyes). Here's the rundown:

Cleanser: [Avene Cleanance Soapless Gel Cleanser](http://www.eau-thermale-avene.ca/en_CA/face/products-for-daily-use/cleanance/cleanance-soapless-gel-cleanser), in a bonus size of 250ml. It's lasted me over a year now, though it's just in the past few months that I'm really trying to get my skincare a strict habit. I also have a Vichy rose petal-based cream cleanser that is no longer available, which I use once in a while, mainly so it doesn't go to waste.

Toner: Thayer's alcohol-free rosewater witch hazel, with a few drops of tea tree oil added. It smells like an old lady! But it's fine. I'm considering whether or not I actually *need* a toner, and I've also got an eye on micellar water as a possibility once I'm finished the bottle of witch hazel. Apparently I like extravagance, but only in my skincare products.

AHA: There are several options available, and from Canadian companies to boot, but I'm currently using [Reversa's glycolic acid night cream](http://www.reversa.ca/index_en/02_nightcreams/02_nightcreams_01.html). The box doesn't look like much, but the cream itself is quite smooth and rich, but not heavy. It's also lasted me over a year, with irregular use until a few months ago. It's a 4% concentration.

BHA: I just picked up a tube of a [Neutrogena 3-in-1 hydrating treatment](http://www.reversa.ca/index_en/02_nightcreams/02_nightcreams_01.html), based on a positive product review on Paula's Choice, which I now can't find. My main problem with the BHA drugstore products is that they all seem overly-fragranced and sticky to me. This one smells like cucumbers, applies smoothly, and absorbs quickly.

Moisturizer: plain ole Cerave in the tub. It's a huge amount of moisturizer for around $20! Crazy! The first-ever moisturizer that made my skin feel and look lovely in the winter was the [Avene Skin Recovery Cream](http://www.eau-thermale-avene.ca/en_CA/face/specific-products/intolerant-skin/skin-recovery-cream-defi). I used to have dry, windburnt skin all winter--tight, with painful flaky red patches. I would slather on layers of moisturizer, which did nothing but clog my pores. This stuff--a pea-sized amount of it--fixed my face almost overnight. I was stunned, and it woke me up to the world of better skincare. I fully intend to buy it again one day.

Dry/sad/angry skin spot treatment: [Cicalfate](http://www.eau-thermale-avene.ca/en_CA/face/specific-products/irritated-skin/cicalfate-restorative-cream). This stuff is awesome as a general restorative barrier cream, better for smaller surfaces as it's only a 40 ml--I wouldn't coat my legs in it. It's thick and protective. I even used it on my tattoo. 

Sunscreen: I'm currently still trying to figure out sunscreens from SCA's perspective, but the past two summers I've used, you guessed it, [Avene's](http://www.eau-thermale-avene.ca/en_CA/suncare/sunscreens/sensitive-skins-spf20-40/high-protection-emulsion-spf-40-tinosorb-ms)! It has a nice texture--I always find sunscreen too heavy, and I still *feel* this one on my face, but it's better than others I've tried. They also have a mineral sunscreen.

For my body, I have a bonus-size [Vichy](http://www.en.vichy.ca/Capital-Soleil/Body-and-Face-protection/SUNSCREEN-CREAM-SPF-60-FACE-AND-BODY-p947.aspx), and it's nice. Thick, as sunscreen would be, but that's less of an issue on my body than my face.

For the face I've also tried the [Vichy mattifying face sunscreen](http://www.en.vichy.ca/Capital-Soleil/Face-Protection/Ultra-Light-Lotion-SPF-50-p951.aspx). La Roche-Posay has one that is literally identical, except for the final listed ingredient of maltodextrin (at least at the time I purchased it), but the Vichy was slightly cheaper so it won. It was fine, but I switched to Avene just because I have such a boner for the brand.

If you want something for the body, Avene also has a [body moisturizer](http://www.eau-thermale-avene.ca/en_CA/body/specific-products/akerat) with lactic acid (AHA) that's nice--though I've only tried samples, not a full-size.

Anyway, this is just my quick two cents. The cosmeticians/beauty experts at Shoppers are actually very knowledgeable about skincare, in my experience. They go to courses and get brand training regularly, and are always available to talk to--of course, it helps infinitely if you find someone who isn't just trying to upsell you expensive products.

"cf9m1ir","Some examples:

John 4. Jesus winsomely explains the gospel to a Samaritan. Not only did Jews normally despise Samaritans and normally avoid contact with them, but they would look down on someone like her who had had many sexual relationships, the last of which at the very least was not kosher. Jesus knew this by revelation. So overruling the somewhat harsh interpretation of the Mosaic Law because of compassion.

Luke as I said has many compassionate episodes, which Luke seems to have been very impressed with.
Luke 5:18-26
Jesus heals a paralysed man, who is lowered through the roof, his friends making a hole in the roof to lower him on a stretcher. Rather than get upset over someone damaging the property Jesus is all concern for the man.

Luke 5:27-32
Jesus calls a tax-collector to become one of his leading disciples, a thoroughly despised group because they basically collected for the Romans, and could additionally charged what they wanted on top and so were often rich but disliked. The pharisees criticise him, but he shows that God wants to move to bring these people back into the fold, rather than shun and despise them.

Luke 6:17-18
Jesus meets a crowd and heals all who were sick, there are other cases of this in Matthew. He wasn't saying 'you're worthy so you can be healed', but rather extending it to all.

Luke 7:11-16 Jesus has compassion on a widow whose son has just died, and raises him from dead, as he is being carried out in his coffin to his funeral.

Luke 7:34 Jesus mentions he's being accused of being involved in too many feasts, and being friends with 'tax-collectors and sinners'.

Luke 7:36-50 Jesus gives forgiveness to a former prostitute, whereas pharisee he is eating with thinks she should be spurned and disapproved of. He honours her and explains the spiritual realities.

If you're comparing them to some guy working a regular 9-5, then they do work longer hours, but it's important to remember that their ""long hours"" tend to include:

* Absolutely zero physical labor
* Long ""work"" meals with clients
* Golf or other recreational activities as ""work

With what you just said, I think you can go one of two ways: First, you could buy a California cabernet--known for their big, muscular tendencies when opened young and deep, savory, spicy qualities to them when they're older. If you wanted to go this rout, and *really* wanted to impress your girlfriend's dad (and perhaps get a chance to drink the bottle) I would buy him something with at least five years of bottle age on it.

My recommendations for California Cab is to get a wine that many connoisseurs enjoy but also has that name brand recognition. Some California Cabs can be too ""big"" (fill in: oaky, jammy, tannic, rich) for some people, but there are many out there that definitely have good provenance and taste good. My first inclinations would be:

Ridge Monte Bello: Hailing from the Santa Cruz Mountains, this wine is a part of history--literally. It was a part of a big contest back in the 70's that put California wine on the map. Monte Bello is Ridge's flagship wine, and it is absolutely stunning: It's made in a style that's not too big, and when you age it it has wonderful bottle characteristics. If your GFs dad knows anything about wine, he'll know Monte Bello, and he'll like it. I've had nearly every vintage since 1990, and they have all been incredible. Like game-changer incredible (in my opinion). One bottle will run you anywhere between 125 and 200 dollars. 

Caymus Special Selection: This wine is more of your typical ""Napa Cab."" Big and rich but silky and robust with flavor, it's been a staple up in Napa for years--and a staple in collectors' cellars. Though young, you could probably drink a Special Selection that's about 5 years old; find an older bottle than that and you're in for more of a treat. Again, anywhere from $115-180.

OR, you could give him a Bordeaux, the Grace Kelly to Napa's Clark Gable. Drinking a good aged Bordeaux is a special occasion in and of itself, and it's not all that hard to find one to buy that's aged. The 2000's are drinking well right now--just showing secondary characteristics--and I'm also quite partial to the 1985 vintage for the price. Oh, 1994 isn't half bad either. My favorites:

Chateau Lynch-Bages

Chateau Leoville-Barton

Chateau Leoville-Las-Cases

Chateau Calon Segur

If you find a 13 year-old (or older) bottle of any of these, it'd be quite appreciated by many, many wine folk. Each one of them you can find for your price range.

Small business ownership has changed a lot in the past 30 or 40 years, specifically the expectations owners have of the returns on their time investment.  Used to be local business owners made about the same as most other jobs they could get.  For example the guy who owns the bakery would take home about as much as the teacher down the street.

Since the eighties this has changed.  I work with a lot of small businesses and the owners have a weird expectation that their status as ""owner"" means that they should be rich.  Not ""yacht"" rich, but definitely mid-range luxury car and a 3500sqft house rich. I used the teacher example earlier because I hear ""if I hire any more, I may as well just be a teacher"" quite a lot.  So these businesses work on a skeleton crew of min-wage employees (and their wives/husbands on as the absentee manager), hiring and firing month-to-month to keep their share high enough to support their lifestyles.  

So I disagree, to an extent. These mom and pop stores are already hiring the bare minimum of employees at the bare minimum hours to sustain their take-home.  Raising their wage costs probably won't result in firings, but in some cases it may result in the business closing.  Which may be a good thing; if a business can't exist without the ability to pay sub-living wages maybe it shouldn't exist to begin with.

Also, we are only talking about minimum wage jobs here.  There are plenty of mom and pop businesses out there who do things like custom furniture making, machining, etc., whose employees are already making far above minimum wage.

"ceqzelb","&gt; The two 600# unmentioned gorillas

I see three gorillas as the heart of the problem:

1. Population
1. Per-capita and total Energy &amp; Resource utilization 
1. Environment

I've been calling it the ""impact-growth nexus"" in my own notes, a pretty ungainly phrase.

Another way of looking at this is that for a given human civilization, you can pick at most any two of three properties:

* High per-capita resource availability (a/k/a wealth)
* Total population
* Duration of civilization

You can be big and rich, but you won't last long.  You can be long-lived and big, but everyone will be poor.  Or you can be wealthy and long-lived, but the total population's limited.  You might be able to manipulate conditions at the margin through more or less stringent regulation, which is to say, fewer personal freedoms, but I suspect that's a fairly limited capability.

There are a vast multitude of 2nd-order effects, most of which are what the mainstream tends to look at as the ""big problems"", though I believe the three I list above underlie them all:   energy crises, financial and economic stress, food and hunger threats, social inequality, political and ethnic strife, health challenges ranging from mal- and mis-nutrition (e.g., diabetes and other metabolic diseases as well as sheer hunger) to epidemic and pandemic disease.  Certain technological challenges present their own consequences, such as nuclear proliferation and WMD -- technologies which are highly dangerous and are either easily attainable or can be secured with sufficient effort even by otherwise limited-capability actors (such as DPRK and nuclear weapons).

You're right about transport and a whole slew of consumptive practices.  James Howard Kunstler and Richard Heinberg address these points and more in their books, which I recommend (there's pretty much a whole Collapse literature by this point, JHK and RH are among the leading authors, though you'll find similar points addressed by many authors).

Conservation's got its champions, Amory Lovens of [Rocky Mountain Institute](http://www.rmi.org/) has been at it longer than most.  There's a problem in the form of [Jevons' Paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jevons_paradox) where increased efficiencies seem to be made up for by increased consumption, though in the face of rising resource costs this might be reduced.  Markets can have counterintuitive logic, though.

The problem with conservation is that it doesn't buy you past the limits of present energy availability, most (90%+) of which is derived from fossil fuels.  We simply have to replace much of that with alternatives + conservation.  Or regress to a pre-industrial level of energy consumption, very likely with a pre-industrial level of civilization.  Your sense that _more_ technology isn't likely to save us is largely right (I've been arguing that point with a couple of folks here), for two reasons:

* Technology itself doesn't create energy flows or stocks, it only exploits them.
* Technology (which is to say, complexity) itself has costs which must be met:  underlying infrastructure that supports a technological stack.

If things fail too far, the ability to support that stack is compromised, either beyond the ability to sustain itself, or worse, beyond the ability for civilization to recover those capabilities.

And I agree that the past two centuries and change have been highly exceptional.  That's been obvious to many from pretty much the start (read the opening paragraphs of William Stanley Jevons _[The Coal Question](http://www.econlib.org/library/YPDBooks/Jevons/jvnCQ1.html#Chapter 1)_ written in 1865 -- and yes, the same Jevons as named above):

&gt; DAY by day it becomes more evident that the Coal we happily possess in excellent quality and abundance is the mainspring of modern material civilization. As the source of fire, it is the source at once of mechanical motion and of chemical change. Accordingly it is the chief agent in almost every improvement or discovery in the arts which the present age brings forth. It is to us indispensable for domestic purposes, and it has of late years been found to yield a series of organic substances, which puzzle us by their complexity, please us by their beautiful colours, and serve us by their various utility.

And Jevons quotes John Williams who wrote in 1789, only 13 years after Adam Smith's _Wealth of Nations_ was published:

&gt; ONE of the earliest writers who conceived it was possible to exhaust our coal mines was John Williams, a mineral surveyor. In his ""Natural History of the Mineral Kingdom,"" first published in 1789, he gave a chapter to the consideration of ""The Limited Quantity of Coal of Britain."" His remarks are highly intelligent, and prove him to be one of the first to appreciate the value of coal, and to foresee the consequences which must some time result from its failure. This event he rather prematurely apprehended; but in those days, when no statistics had been collected, and a geological map was unthought of, accurate notions were not to be expected. Still, his views on this subject may be read with profit, even at the present day.",1389876926,"another way of looking at this is that for a given human civilization, you can pick at most any two of three properties:  * high per-capita resource availability (a/k/a wealth) * total population * duration of civilization  you can be big and rich, but you won't last long.","big and rich","rich",NA,FALSE,"big and rich","big",NA,NA,0

Unfortunately Anya also dates a rich guy, Peter, who drives a fancy lotus and has a stuffed Gucci wallet.

* submitting links and self-posts
* voting on those submissions (to promote visibility or reduce it)
* commenting on those submissions
* responding to and voting on comments (to promote visibility or reduce it)
* subreddits
* culture

At it's base, reddit is a ""social media"" website that allows people to share and discuss content they find on the internet, and to somewhat organize that content into separate channels of information (subreddits) where those with niche interests may find like-minded individuals and more content for their interest.

Culture: rich but silly, maintained by long collective memories of regular visitors - because visitors usually remain active for years, often brusque and often kindhearted, dynamic and rapidly evolving  (perhaps the most dynamic culture of comparable scale on the planet) - becoming more self-aware every day. 

Though at times it can appear trivial, shallow, petty, or silly, I believe the site and it's culture's history (not just the big events, but the little conversations) are prime demonstrations of the process through which humanity will come to evolve into a more cohesive and complex community by engaging in conversation with itself.

Well, I'm an economist, not a binarist twit, so I wouldn't say something like that, because I recognize the difference between no opportunity and some opportunity. Which is why I also wouldn't say it's impossible for a poor American to be rich, but rather difficult and reliant on luck. You don't think in terms of aggregates because you're wedded to the Just World Hypothesis in this area. In your opinion, nearly every obese person is obese due to moral failure.

Why then, are the French less frequently obese than the Americans? I mean, it couldn't be their fantastic transportation system that allows people to not have to have a car to have a job or anything...

All people in all the earth suffer, we all sin, we all die. Yes, some of us fortunate to be born in wealthy countries have a much higher average quality of life than those born in poor countries in many regards. 

But if God values obedience, repentance, and faith, then I'd say that it can be empirically proven that, by those standards, the poorer the country is, the richer it proves to be in those ways. 

If the sufferings of this life are a mere 80 years, and often mixed with a lot of joy in between periods of suffering, but then followed in the next life by eternal infinite joy, then it certainly helps if we view suffering in proper perspective.

So to get around finally to answering/making my point. I think God very well may be answering the prayers of those who are starving, persecuted, and dying, he just isn't helping them with those things. 

And conversely, I think God may very well be answering the prayers of the wealthy, healthy, and rich, but he isn't helping them with those things. 

I think God helps us with things like faith, chastity, holiness, endurance of suffering, and things like that. Not by alleviating suffering, and not by giving us riches either. 

And before you say it isn't fair that some are rich and some are poor, again I'll say if you look at which country has more people with real faith and practising real piety and righteousness, I think the poor countries are leading the rich countries by a long shot, and will most definitely proceed them into the Kingdom.

"cd30i78","So we have been experimenting and loving a bunch of different sweet variations on the cheesecake cupcake. User /cyanpineapple mentioned eating a savory version and her suggestions and links helped me create this recipe. It turned out really well. As I was tasting it, it seemed so familiar – realized that it tastes almost exactly like one of those four cheese egg soufflé cups at Panera! (Sans the carbs, of course!) These are incredibly rich but delicious!

So I pretty much followed the sweet recipe I use, altering it a bit.

For the filling: I beat together 2 bricks of cream cheese, 2 eggs, and  ¼ cup heavy whipping cream. After it was all smooth, I added  1 cup of freshly shredded Asiago cheese, approx. ½ tsp. each of onion and garlic powders (or to taste), a bunch of turns of cracked pepper and stirred it all together.

For the crust: ½ stick of melted butter combined with ½ c. of almond flour and 2 tsp. of Mama Francesca Fiero Parmesan and Red Pepper seasoning (basically a seasoned grated parm I found at Wal-Mart).
 
Divide the crust mixture on the bottom of 12 cupcake papers in a cupcake pan. Use an ice cream scoop to distribute the filling evenly. 

Bake in 350 degree oven for 16-18 minutes (mine was more toward the 18-minute mark). Let cool in pan until they seem set…they deflate a little! Then remove from pan and cool further on wire rack. Then refrigerate.

"ccuugcv","&gt; ""False"" rape accusations and child support? Those are not real problems. Male suicide rates and strict gender roles? Those are.

To be honest that's oversimplifying it. Those two (four?) topics you mention are interconnected and complex. The modern feminist discourse I was taught in Uni spoke of things like intersectionality, which literally addresses how categories of ""being"" intersect and affect one another. 

Class and race ire huge ones that MRAs seem to not emphasize as much as ""MEN MEN MEN MEN WHAT ABOUT THE MEN."" It's not just whether you're a man. I would say the men living at/below poverty level being chased down for child support when they are living a life of struggle, crime, drugs, etc. is unfair. I would say that African American men getting incarcerated at higher rates than men in general is unfair. What is the class of men primarily paying child support? What is their race? You need to break it down further. Then ask, ""Who runs the government? Who gains the most from these laws?"" MRAs do none of this. They stop breaking things down when they reach ""men vs. women"" and they like to imply that patriarchy doesn't exist because it's a *feminist* word, when literally most people in charge of things are men. 

They can say ""well back in the day, yes, patriarchy existed but it was a bunch of powerful rich men in charge...sure, women were property of men regardless of class, but *things are different now*...women can vote...and stuff...they're not in charge of things because they don't pursue it....what glass ceiling?"" Then they turn around and say these days, ""feminism has gone 'too far.'"" The rich, powerful men have overcompensated for their errors by giving women TOO MANY privileges. What about the mens?! The mens that maybe aren't *that* rich but still white and able bodied and cis and all that good stuff? And why would rich, powerful white men want to submit to women's little manipulative ways and create laws which harm men? Fuck if I know. 

They'll say they're for MEN'S rights, but they're really for straight, affluent, white, cisgender, able-bodied, sexual men's rights. They don't give a fuck about intersectionality and they'll readily ignore the fact that most people in power in general are men.

Im not personally a fan of a large church simply because its so hard to connect to one with so many people, but also because when churches get that big they can attract people who attend for the status of being among the rich and spiritual. Preachers of such churches can get mesmerized by the jumbo tithes that roll in and start preaching the gospel of prosperity, which is pretty much ""God wants you to be happy and rich!"" But they leave out the parts about serving Him and others and how sometimes service isn't pretty or prosperous. This isn't something I would automatically assume about any church just bc its big and had money. Attend a service or two and see if the preacher only does happy fun feel good sermons. If so, it might be a wonky church. Not to say either that you should only trust the small fire and brimstone churches bc a lot of those are creepy. The point I'm trying to say I guess is that yeah a lot of churches are creepy money monsters but they're not the majority or the norm.

"ccjribx","I was a teenager at the time, so the intricacies of their insurance policy are lost on me, but mostly the long repayment came from just how insane the markup is on medical services.  I never studied the bills, but I know the final tally before insurance was well over $20k. My dad was in the ER, had surgery, then transferred to ICU, then he had surgery again, then back to the ICU, then another surgery, with multiple tests, x-rays, and all sorts of awfulness in between.  Eventually he got moved from the ICU to the recovery ward, but the cost of even that room adds up when you stay for over a week.

My parents insurance actually paid the whole bill up front. Well, not the whole bill, they tried to nickle and dime us on what tests they decided to cover, but they paid off the hospital anyway.  Whatever they didn't cover my mom paid back to them in small chunks for *years*. I remember when she gleefully waved the final bill around, and I was baffled.

By the end of the second date she thought he was hilarious. Third day, third date, she thought she was in love. He, let's call him William, went back to Enland. They exchanged letters for 5 months. He bought her a plane ticket for a two week visit. She loved him, but was very wary of men and one day threw hot soup at him during an argument she had been picking. William left, she packed her shit. He came back and read her a letter saying he wasnt going anywhere. She could push and push and push him away but he would stay. She came back Engaged. She stayed in Canada for another two months, moved to England, and they got married there 5 weeks after. 

Today, they are the happiest, kindest, cutest couple i know, married 25 years, with three beautiful kids all in Ivy league schools in the states, all very down to earth. And now they're millionaires:)

"cbuh1mf","One could quite easily make the complete opposite hypothesis that more intelligent people would be more susceptible to cognitive bias as they would remember or have available greater sources to disprove any single source at a given time. 

I don't really think lowered drinking age or abortion is a good example to use in a study. Firstly with abortion, it is entirely moral, normally based on some idealogical stand point, there is no real science to say that abortions are bad and someone who is pro-abortion and isn't religious isn't going to take religious teaching as valid evidence against it, that isn't cognitive bias, as the argument against it isn't scientifically based. 

As for a lowered drinking age, if the study was based in America the drinking age isn't in line with the rest of the world anyway, once again there is no right or wrong answer, and once again claiming restriction fixes whatever problem that having it would cause isn't cognitive bias; the person just might not believe that restriction even works and therefore didn't bring it up. It really depends on the arguments used for or against the drinking age to actually ascertain if it is a good example, there are many that really aren't, such as saying restriction will stop people getting it, it doesn't, but then an anti-restriction point could be that you can join the army and die but can't drink, of which these point aren't really that relevant to each other. 

People aren't going to like joint pro and con papers if they believe that (most likely) some of the con arguments aren't valid reasoning in the first place, for instance in the case of abortion, that all life is sacred, if that is in the same paper as a fetus isn't alive then of course the are going to disregard the first point, but that isn't cognitive bias. Another example that could be classed as cognitive bias is an abortion at a later date where the argument is that the fetus/baby can survive on its own outside the mother, that is a factual argument against abortion after a certain date, it is alive because it can survive on its own, denying that argument is cognitive bias because the argument is based on something scientifically true. Of course you are going to get the exact opposite where people say religious teaching is over arching and the science is irrelevant, but I don't think there cognitive bias started anywhere close to the points that the study would have brought up and I don't think any one has shown being religious is negatively correlated to intelligence. 

Whereas with stealing your own organs, the only positive effect is money for the person, which will disproportionately effect the poor while making it a rich mans market place, it really has no positive effects for society, just some poor people with a temporary pay off, which they will most likely waste, and then have on going health issues, or shorter life expectancy, it is nearly universally bad, if you don't take the arguments in a vacuum, it is bad that an organ market exists as it is exploitable, it is bad for the long term health of the donator, it is good for the rich but bad for society and equality. 

You need a point where both sides have facts that can't actually be disputed or thrown away and therefore people have to be ignoring them, one example might be one universal healthcare in relation to overall standard of living for the population, of course universal healthcare is going to pull up the bottom rungs of society and therefore improve overall standard of living, however people may choose to ignore this because they don't want to pay extra money in taxes to provide for it and maybe compromise healthcare for the middle market, but that doesn't make the original point that it would improve overall standard of living on average.

"cbqrs9o","The ""problem"" is real, although it is not very prevalent and it isn't that big of a problem IMHO. That may be the voice of someone that has the so called ""problems"" (I read your ""okay to not squat 300"" about 5 times before I realized you meant that was a high weight for instance) but the perspective changes. 

No one is going to criticize an Olympic athlete for total life devotion to say running sprints - so why is there a ""problem"" with someone to desire a larger body? Spending literal YEARS in training for occasional seconds long races is prized highly, and a lot of those people end up with health problems as well. 

I have spent literally thousands of hours in the gym. Thousands. I went from a scrawny kid to being relatively large (~220@5'10"") and I am still not satisfied. Any type of dress shirt or suit is a problem, because they aren't cut to fit people my shape. I have had lifting injuries that temporarily (3 months or so) prevented certain movements. I have arms as big around as coffee cans.  Still I look at myself in a mirror and don't see myself as big, I still feel too small. 

Basically I fit near every point of ""bigorexia"" other than steroid use, but I have taken everything up to that and honestly if I had a known source of good steroids I would probably take them, ""just for a bit"" of course.  

If you took out the desire for body change and substituted it with ""being a great runner"", ""winning bicycle races"", ""great quarterback"" or similar I wouldn't ""have problems"" but would instead be a ""devoted athlete."" 

So the problem, other than the extreme rare cases, IMHO has more to do with a general hate of bodybuilding than an overall opinion on physical activity or exercise. 

Bodybuilding is something that people ""love to hate"" because while damn near every single young boy desires that magazine body (just like girls feel on the women in magazines) they don't realize how difficult it is until they start trying. So when they realize they lack the devotion (or ability, or enough desire) they trash talk that look. Someone that looks like that ""has problems"" or ""doesn't have a life."" The similarity to the hate of the smart kid is damn near identical - ""I would read but I have a life"", ""I ain't wasting my time on math"", etc. 

The real problem is that instead of just honestly saying ""that guy has a way better body, and HE is the one that did it"" people try to turn it into something else. Those guys don't really care about that chatter, because it is basically the same of ""yeah he is rich, but so much time spent at work.""

"cbbgqqi","&gt;Are you defending that a high gap between rich and poor is important to a good economy, or just disagree with me that the hardship would just be short term?

A decent gap is necessary.  Not everyone can be rich at once, it just can't happen.  However, I do think that the poor are far too poor and that the rich are somewhat too rich.  But I don't see a reason to dally with it right now.  We're in a depression, jobless rate is like 10% why would we pull the investment floor out now?

Listen, I agree with you some what.  I agree that the rich certainly should be taxed more than they are now.  But right now isn't the time to start taxing them.  The economy is depressed, people aren't borrowing money and consuming.  So lets solve that by having the government borrow money until consumers and companies are willing to pick up the money.  

&gt;..Huh? You're blaming labor unions, or blaming us moving away from labor unions? 

I'm blaming the lack of a labour movement.  Countries like Canada and UK have a strong labour movement and our income inequality is far lower than that of the USA.

&gt;but see no way that this would actually normalize the distribution of wealth curve 

I think your priorities are out of whack.  We're in a depression, unemployment is at 7.8% (that number is actually useless now as so many people have been unemployed for so long.), now isn't the time to be talking about raising taxes and destroying an entire strata of the society.  Save that for the boom time man.

There was a commenter recently on an agony aunt column (I forget where, or I would link) who made pretty much the same point.  Assuming you want a couple of kids, you need to start that by 35 at the latest.

Working back, you'll probably want to have enjoyed a couple of years of marriage before you start your family.  So that means marrying (or getting into your permanent living situation) by 33.

You don't usually marry someone within less than two years of meeting them, so that means meeting them by 31.

Therefore, by your late twenties, *if you want marriage and children*, you need to start dating the kinds of guys who are on the same page.

Of course there are women that have ""whirlwind romances"" and meet a guy in their late thirties and start a family within a few months, and have twins, or are fertile in their early forties.  But this is not the norm.

"c9sw6lp","[**The Cook, The Thief, His Wife and Her Lover**](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0097108/) (1989) Directed by Peter Greenaway - *The wife of an oafish restaurant owner becomes bored with her husband and considers an affair with a regular patron.*

Do food and sexuality really compliment each other in such a delicious manner as people suggest? I'd look no further than this film if you wanted to explore that subject further but prepared to have a stomach for some very unpalatable dishes. Greenaway here presents that classic combination of a gorgeous, high class aesthetic filled with a stomach churning and truly despicable characters. Michael Gambon here is notably brutal in his portrayal of a wife-beating, egotistical gangster and brings a presence usually reserved for the stage to a film filled with great performances ranging from sultry to disgusting.
The whole film, in fact, feels like a theatre production but in the best of ways. The costumes are extravagant and the world is realised within the first ten minutes by a tracking shot that takes us from the car park to the restaurant, taking us on a journey bathed with fluorescent lights and the most audacious costumes (designed by Jean Paul Gaultier nonetheless) and I felt like part of the scenery, a fly on the wall, if you will.
The film is not perfectly paced but the tension surrounding the story was enough to keep me interested (special mention should go to the classical soundtrack which lends a very timeless, almost dystopian, energy to the film) and the grisly ending was more than worth the wait. As far as late eighties films go, this one has aged incredibly well, much like Helen Mirren who looks stunning here, and I think this is because it refuses to be pinned down. I've heard it described as an art film by other critics and whilst it has a distinctive style, it's far from impenetrable and works well as a simple piece of entertainment (of the dark variety of course).

[**Blood Simple**](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086979/) (1984) Directed by Joel Coen - *A rich but jealous man hires a private investigator to kill his cheating wife and her new man but when blood is involved, nothing is simple.*

Upon realising I had never seen the Coen Bros much lauded first film, I had no reservations with putting this one on and sinking into that very warm, familiar but also somehow unique sense of cinema that has been a Coen Bros trademark for, wow, thirty years now. **Blood Simple** was much grittier than I expected, the smooth, noir-like intentions of later movies being foreshadowed but not quite replicated and the first ten minutes of this film felt more similar to a 70's exploitation film than any Tarantino piece I have watched. The story comes together clumsily, but in a charming way, the introductions of the characters arriving with very little fanfare, opting instead for a reserved, audience-centred approach, hinting very little at the bloodshed to come whilst gently intertwining and setting up the excellent, morally complex, and substantially violent, final third.
Style is a word that is associated with the Coens a lot and things are no different here in what is a very assured directorial debut. Scenes often begin with a stylised shot on an inane object (a lighter, a lamp, a bed) and even though what we are looking at isn't particularly exciting, the Coens, and their cinematographer Barry Sonnenfeld (of all people!) manage to make you take notice of the little things, drawing you in without being gaudy like a lot of these crime-based thrillers do. McDormand is clearly the standout actor of the main group and you can see why the brothers got so attached to her as a leading lady because she really is quite lovely as the anti-femme fatale here. That being said, the film wouldn't be the same without M. Emmet Walsh as the sleaziest detective since Orson Welle's Hank Quinlan who gives the film a much needed dose of that pulp attitude that we shall see for years to come. The film purrs like a well oiled engine throughout and then burns rubber in the last fifteen minutes when all kinds of hell break loose. The only thing separating **Blood Simple** from the Coen's later masterpieces like **No Country for Old Men** and **The Big Lewbowski** is the obvious budgetary restraints and more mature colour palettes. Everything else is stellar.

[**Plan 9 From Outer Space**](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0052077/) (1959) Directed by Edward D. Wood Jr. - *Aliens resurrect dead humans as zombies in order to stop mankind from creating the universe-destroying Solaranite (a sort of sun-driven bomb).*

I'm sure many of you have heard of this film being touted as ""the worst film ever made"" but I can assure you that I have seen much worse. **Plan 9…** is terrible, don't get me wrong, full of nonsensical dialogue, a ham-fisted plot, ridiculous special effects and some of the most stomach churning acting you have ever seen but even so, there is so much love poured into this film that it is hard not to admire Wood's sheer passion for his creation. He had such faith in Lugosi as an actor and I couldn't help but smile watching him go about his Dracula schtick like it was 1931 all over again. Cinema is an art form and much bad cinema cannot be forgiven and should not be put up on a pedestal but Wood tries so hard here and fails so beautifully that **Plan 9** is a historical artefact, an example of passion misdirected. There is fun to be had with the shoddy sets and pompous subtleties (the alien salute is wonderful) but there are sluggish moments so the film is most enjoyed with friends at 2 in the morning under various illicit substances.

[**Cries and Whispers**](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0069467/) (1972) Directed by Ingmar Bergman - *When a woman dying of cancer in turn-of-the-century Sweden is visited by her two sisters, long repressed feelings between the siblings rise to the surface.*

There are very few films that have elicited a strong physical response from me because of their subject matter but this one managed to make me turn my gaze away from the screen quite forcefully (albeit in a very different way than something like **Irreversible**) and I must commend Bergman for that even if I thought that overall, this film was a mystery too far from the Swedish director. Quite clearly, he likes his films to be vague and transcendental, most evident in **Persona**, but unlike the aforementioned work, this film's mystery lies in it's characters rather than it's aesthetic and whilst this makes for compelling viewing, the sisters in this film feel unexplored and merely touched upon and because of this I was left with a stinging confusion rather than the emotional crescendo that it felt like Bergman was aiming for.
Even so, what we have here is a richly detail tapestry of heightened emotion and subtle but stunning cinematography. The film contains flashbacks from each of the four main females in the film and we are shown snippets of what seem like brutal but telling moments of their recent history and relationships with each other. The way the film segues from a shot of a face (Ebert claims nobody shot faces as well as Bergman and I tend to agree thus far in my cinematic journey) in a haze of red and into the flashback is pretty lovely stuff and the blood red decor of the stately home that these women seem imprisoned in lends a sharp and telling backdrop to the narrative. The performances are strong but the writing is vague, the most indicative scene being when a priest gives his eulogy at the death bed and shows more emotion towards the deceased than either of the sisters have so far. I will say that it contains possibly my favourite Bergman moment so far and this occurs mere seconds after their sister, groaning zombie-like for what seems like days, finally succumbs to her illness and dies. As the nurse looks up from the bed, the room slowly but noticeably dims. It doesn't get dark and nothing really changes but the death seems to cast a shadow physically as well as metaphorically. It was beautiful stuff.

[**Stuck**](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0758786/) (2007) Directed by Stuart Gordon - *A young career woman commits a hit-and-run whilst intoxicated and the victim gets stuck in her windshield. Calamity ensues.*

(This is probably one for you 'a113er') On the surface, this film comes across as a low-budget, by-the-numbers thriller with several moments of action to appease a lazy audience. And, to be fair, it is these things. But it can also be seen as a black comedy, a satire, a horror film or a human drama and this is what makes Stuart Gordon such a watchable, and in my opinion underrated, director. By blending these things together, I think the film ultimately becomes an original and highly entertaining work. The way in which our male lead's day goes from bad, to worse/t is almost laughable in it's simplicity and the mind-numbing decisions made by our female lead are aggravating, absurd and yet totally realistic. After all, this is apparently based on a true story. There are some really horrible scenes of mutilation via car crash and Stephen Rea does an awesome job from start to finish as a man we want to root for. It had me shouting at the screen before I realised how stupid I looked and I couldn't recommend this film any more as a fantastic way to was an hour and a half with some friends. It's silly but it's supposed to be, leaving us to sit and think about the decisions we make and the craziness that can envelop us at any given moment.",1367775075,"[**blood simple**](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086979/) (1984) directed by joel coen - *a rich but jealous man hires a private investigator to kill his cheating wife and her new man but when blood is involved, nothing is simple.","rich but jealous","rich","but",FALSE,"rich but jealous","jealous",NA,NA,1

"c9e8hun","We can look to the era of [illegal gold ownership in the US](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Order_6102), for guidance (1933-1971).  USG did not search bank safety deposit boxes for gold.  At least one person created a situation where their gold, in a bank, became known to USG, who then stole it (after the executive order was tested in the courts, which bent over willingly).  

In the case of Bitcoin, this would look like getting swatted and seeing all your computers disappear, for evidence against you, in your witch trial.  Hopefully that does not reveal your keys.

During gold prohibition, as a result of foreign options for ownership, interesting gold holding companies were born.  If you look at the history of commodity ETFs, you see that a Canadian, in 1961, figured out how to run a company that just stored gold in a vault, and got it listed on US exchanges.  Since gold usually requires a counterparty anyway, when holding large amounts, this was not much worse than legal ownership.  This stock market blockade-running (easy for the rich but inaccessible to the poor) is probably what forced Nixon to relent about gold ownership.

"c9aqzh4","A vaporizer or a volcano vaporizer? Vaporizers - hell yeah. More efficient, healthier consumption, costs about as much as generic bong.

As to Volcano - definitely not worth it for a cannabis user. Cannaboids are released at 180℃ Nothing harmful gets released anywhere near that point, so a vapo that works at set 200℃ will do just fine.

Volcano allows you to set given temperature, and stays firmly on point. First wave will not be hotter than set temp, and last blows will not be colder (think coffee machine). Setting 225, will have it _work_ at 225, not 219 or 231 (not that for Cannabis user -anything above 180 works just fine). All that combined means it's best for research application. And sometimes, it's easier to justify $550 expense that will help you in any future research on vapor extraction, than $80 on that one study that the Uni frowns upon in the first place.

One advantage applied to Volcano is that vaporizers are known to first extract THC-less aromas, and then THC rich but odorless extract - and Volcano balloon combines the two. Thing is, you can replicate that effect with any fucking baloon of your own ;-) Just extract everything into the vessel, mix, inhale.

If you find yourself drifting through life, it's because you have not seen anything worth ascertaining. Not just love; love is only one part to your bigger existence. Here's the sad part: even if you become ridiculously wealthy and rich but you choose to do nothing about it, you will still feel you're drifting through life. And also, not matter what you do *NOTHING* will potentially effect this universe. That's just something everyone has to deal with. Now as far as happiness, find that one thing you enjoy and try to imagine it on a bigger scale. Maybe not a job or doing it many times a day, but possibly with someone else that enjoys it just as much or on the other side of the world. Maybe even defending it somewhere as big as court or something as small as the internet.

"c9ajcyh","Yeah it too me absolutely forever to get to ~50 in MS the first time. It's so funny looking back taking into account the current state of the game. At level 50, few people were higher level than I was while randomly walking around or training and the people that were always seemed absolutely rich and well connected.

And then I played for a while, a year ago now I guess. But the difference was not so much about the speed of leveling, although that felt so much better, but the speed of income early on. I was fucking rich within a week. I wasn't actually rich, but compared to ""back in the day."" I was. I could buy anything that I wanted within reasonable range. I always had the best things I could use for my level, no exceptions. 

And I'm sure by now it's even faster.

This happens in all games though. Over time the game starts to cater to more casual players. I think about games like FF11 where it took absolutely forever to get to max level in the beginning and that was the whole point of the game, leveling up.

I became obsessed with track at 11 after seeing Cuban powerhouse Alberto Juantorina kill it in the 800m at the Montreal Olympics. We lived in a working class neighborhood in Canada and everyone played hockey but we couldn't afford it (I would have sucked anyway - I had monocular vision so soccer, basketball and baseball were hopeless - even neighborhood stuff).  We had the worst school in the district (it was a grade 7 to 13 high school) and were surrounded by public housing so there were lots of kids who needed a sport but didn't have much money.

Luckily, track was incredibly cheap.  Plus my Dad volunteered so we didn't have to pay much if anything for club dues when I ran with a club organized by some incredible teachers and local Dads.  I ran each pair of shoes til they fell off.  We all did.  It was awesome!  

By the time I reached college, expenses were less of an issue coz my Dad was moving up in the world and dues were paid by others but equipment was always too expensive, so I worked at a gas station and a running store so I could afford extra shoes, spikes, etc.

I am thankful for the experience every day.

Edit : I hadn't thought in a long time about  how much my Dad and the other Dads did to make it work - thank you for helping me remember how awesome he was (and is).  He's coming for Easter and I'll be sure to thank him.

"c8wso5d","&gt; Anyway, people don't resent the rich because they're enjoying what they earned. They resent the rich because they assume that they benefited from a fixed game where it's hard to fall and even harder to climb. Lots of rich teenagers can get booked on felony crimes and still live a posh lifestyle. If a poor kid gets caught with a joint, he could lose his one shot at college. Doesn't that sound like an unfair game? People resent it when the rules aren't fair - and a fair shot is the one thing we're promised over and over again with the American dream.

I don't deny that contempt for the rich isn't an alluring vice.  I myself, being poor, find it would be easier to blame my station in life on rich people who butchered the economy, who downsized the company for which I once worked or who made gas so expensive I have to consider carefully when I leave my home.  Contempt is easy, but wrong.

You see, I was once rich.  But I lost it not because I was unlucky, but because I lived in the moment.  I don't regret my decisions.  But I did learn from them.  I will be rich again, because I know it's a matter of focus and education.  However, it would be extremely hard for me to do so if I knocked up a couple of girls and relied on government hand-outs to live.  Then, yes, getting rich again would be improbably difficult.  But, I'm making the decisions not to do these things.  

Fairness is illusion.  No two people would ever agree on what is fair.  Can you even imagine how this fantasy land would work?  Even if everybody made the same amount of money, one person's life would be unfair because they worked in sewage while another in an air conditioned office in the 30th floor.  And if the man in sewage made more money to compensate, it wouldn't be fair that the man born with one arm could never work in sewage.  And in order to compensate for THAT, it wouldn't be fair that the man born of one arm got subsidized while the man who lost an arm in accident didn't.  And if he DID, then people would be incentivised to lose their arm's in accidents so they could enjoy the eternal payout.  Meaning, as soon as build a system, even a ""Fair"" system where people can get paid for not producing, then production comes to a halt.  Thus, wealth comes to a halt as well.

I would argue, concerning the American Dream, that is definitely not dead.  But that it's ease of access has been somewhat stifled.  I would argue that contempt for the rich, unnecessary bureaucratic control and excessive ease to government money (for rich and poor) has led to hurting the American Dream more than helping it.  

Making the case in full to this effect is in large part to a significant amount of facts and figures to numerous to outlay here.

"c8qdxsl","This became a much longer response than I expected, so just a warning. Thanks for being so thought-provoking. 

&gt; When I was your age I had a girlfriend as well. I was also rational, level headed, and one of top students in my highschool. And I had been taught well by a stable family.

There's definitely a feeling that, having grown up in an open, relatively affluent, very stable area without much trauma and with a wide education, things are easier and relationships are often kind of simpler and more easily respectful and honest. I'm probably not phrasing that right but the fact that you mention this makes me feel like you can relate. I definitely don't mean for it to sound spoiled or snobby.

&gt; In addition, I new my girlfriend and I were fundamentally incompatible for a true serious relationship i.e. I knew i'd never marry her.

Marriage aside, I would say I've never felt that fundamental incompatibility. It'll probably show up later, but I have yet to feel it.

&gt; The reason people here are making fun of you and telling you that you will someday hate her is because they all went through the same thing.

I get it and I'm not offended or anything. I don't think there's much making fun. Largely people have been supportive, just knowing from their perspectives and experiences that I need to be ready for it to end, maybe hostilely.

&gt; Children throw toys and scream when they don't get their way because they don't know how to deal with anger and sadness. Teenagers make comparable mistakes in love.

I realize, going through line by line like this it might seem like I'm arguing with you, but really I just want to give your fantastic response the attention I owe it.

I would agree with you here. It's a new emotion. I've never felt it exactly this way with anyone before (the only comparison is family, which is of course different) so I'm not experienced. I've needed to learn how to gauge both our feelings, what intensity to express it at, what intensity I'm actually feeling it at, etc. But just because you make mistakes, I don't think that makes the emotion any less valid. And just because you've made these mistakes with someone, if you both grow and learn from the mistakes together, it doesn't have to (but I know in the vast majority of cases it usually does) preclude you from staying with them for a long time.

&gt; The link you posted, where the guy said ""my whole life is here,"" is nothing like what you feel. You think it is, but it isn't. For him that is a mature sense of responsibility and love. You can't even begin to imagine the complexity involved in creating and caring for a family. It is a rich but heavy burden. For you this is just a tidal wave of hormonal lust and feelings of romance, in their most raw form. As long as you met a girl who you find attractive and meets your basic personality requirements, you'd feel this same way. And to that end your feelings have more to do with your novel appreciation of this feeling than they do with a deep compatible, mature, and healthy love for a specific human/partner.

This is very hard for me to grasp. I think you're wrong. Maybe you'll be proven right and you've made the point very well, but at this moment in my life I think you're wrong. It's true that I don't have responsibility for her the way I would as an adult in a family. Not even close. Also he included his child, a responsibility which I cannot even fathom. So it isn't the same. But the feeling of investment in this one person (in his case two and a dog) I think is similar. You're right that on the whole they are very different situations and feelings. The imagery still speaks to me in terms of how I feel toward her, but you're completely right.

The rest of the paragraph is where I think you're wrong. I say that with no animosity, since like I said, you could well be right. But right now I have to think you're wrong. You said, in your case, you knew you two were incompatible for a serious relationship. I don't feel that way. I think, had I gotten together with hundreds of girls instead of her, maybe I fall in love with some, but maybe it's just her. Who knows? My attraction to her - or the raw, hormonal lust you mention - is strong, but I think much of that attraction is not just physical lust. I also think my emotional, mental love for her is separate from any feeling of lust, although my attraction to her is intertwined. Hope I'm making some sense. 

And in terms of appreciating the feeling more than the specific person (bad summary but I think I get what you meant), I still disagree. This feeling of attachment is new and special, but I think it's extremely specific to her. As a person, I see her unlike anyone else and I feel that the way we interact, the compatibility we have, is not just an inevitable development from meeting someone who I find attractive and meets my basic personality requirements, as you said. There's no real way of proving it either way and that isn't my goal. You're probably right. But I can't know that now. We both feel we improve each other's lives immensely. We've each faced certain adversity that the other has made infinitely better. It's impossible to quantify something like this and it's not a point that can be made to anyone, online or otherwise, but right now it's what I feel.

&gt; The good news is no one expects you to control your emotions. I remember I finally left my girlfriend after two years because she treated me poorly, was immature, and we did not want anywhere near the same things from life. Despite knowing this and understanding the science behind puberty, I was crushed. I felt like I couldn't breath. I lost 20 pounds in two months and had a breakdown. It was such an intense pain, I couldn't stand it. I literally had to force myself to think of it as a biochemical illness, which was how I tried to cope in my own 'intellectual' way. Still... I was crushed, and it took me a long time to get over it.

Coping when/if it ends will be extremely difficult. I've never had that feeling before so I can't even know how difficult it will be, but I can try to imagine. Like you said, no one expects me to control my emotions. I could make the mostly-inevitable breakup less painful and more under control by not falling too hard now. But I think it's much better, and you seem to agree, to invest everything I feel and not worry about remaining measured for fear of getting hurt, and then taking the pain as it comes later. Of course you shouldn't go crazy over someone, at this age or any other, but I think pouring everything you truly feel in and holding nothing back is better than never fully opening up so you don't get hurt. At least that's how I'm acting in my case.

&gt; You have a lot to learn. Just like we all did. And you can't control your emotions. But you can control your behavior and your actions, and you can try to learn and mature. Some people never learn from their first relationships and live in unhealthy relationships and marriages their whole lives. You will make mistakes and learn a lot, and this will end with a heavy heart almost certainly. But learn what you need from a women and keep growing :)

I've already learned so much from this relationship. I've made mistakes, there's been awkwardness, there have been miscommunications, even small conflicts. I now know much better how to handle these things in the future. That said, if she grows and learns at the same rate and we can improve each other as people and not hold each other back or continue to make the same mistakes, I think it's possible to keep growing with the same person. Very unlikely, but it happens. Assuming we breakup, after the pain subsides, I hope I'll look back on this favorably, even gratefully, for all the lessons and great experiences.

I like the comic. I know I still have a whole life ahead of me to learn. This relationship is the tip of the iceberg. But as long as I can keep seeing more of the iceberg with this same person, that's the plan. And when it ends, I'll be better prepared for the rest of the iceberg.

"c8myz9t","I've served on two juries because I do not avoid my duty. I do this because I am smart enough to realize that our jury system is specifically designed so that justice is rendered by common people. It was given to us by founders who were sick and tired of the historical injustices resulting from power residing in the hands of rulers and aristocracy, where a commoner did not have a prayer of having a fair say against the elite, where a king could condemn someone to death with the wave of a hand. If you don't support the jury system you don't support democracy and instead support the idea that our lives should reside in the hands of the few rich and powerful.

The jury system is one of the very few instances where the conscience of the common person remains paramount. Our elections are owned by the rich. Our legislature is owned by the rich. But in a jury case, even though highly paid lawyers can have their say, it still remains for a group of common citizens to render judgment.

From the 1968 SCOTUS ruling in Duncan vs. Lousiana:

&gt;""Those who wrote our constitutions knew from history and experience that it was necessary to protect against unfounded criminal charges brought to eliminate enemies and against judges too responsive to the voice of higher authority. The framers of the constitutions strove to create an independent judiciary but insisted upon further protection against arbitrary action. Providing an accused with the right trial by a jury of his peers gave him an inestimable safeguard against the corrupt or overzealous prosecutor and against the compliant, biased, or eccentric judge.""

"c7npand","&gt; Hierarchy. It creates a ""ruling"" class in owners with a ""subservient"" class of workers. As mutualists, we're anarchists, thus we oppose this.

Again, not necessarily. Only if someone wants to be in the ""subservient"" class of workers do they become a worker.

&gt; Fine... Private ownership, the worker does not own; he works and receives a wage (or none in slavery). Worker ownership, anyone who works, is an owner.

He does own! What else is he trading for his wage? What you're advocating is for free and accessible capital to all, which is not how nature works.

Although, I do see now what you mean by ""market socialism"". Like I just said, you want free and accessible capital, because (I'm assuming here) it's ""improper"" to own capital?

&gt; Just as in free market capitalism there's no such thing as a coop or a credit union, because as soon as one of those emerges, it's technically no longer capitalism.

Yes it is. Just because you have private ownership of something doesn't require you to keep it forever. You can give up ownership of something for whatever reason you want; creating a co-op may be one of those things.

&gt; But fewer people have access to capital in capitalism. More money is spread around for use in circulation when it's worker owned and profits are shared.

And even more in total state-sponsored communism. But spreading the wealth does not create prosperity, and

&gt; In socialism, more people benefit. There's fewer super rich and fewer destitute poor. There's still poor and still rich, but they're not as poor nor as rich. It is naturally spread around as opposed to forcibly like in communism.

is false. And it's not naturally spread around; what happens in a mutualist society if someone decides to start a business with a few workers who all agreed to a ""capitalist""-worker relationship? You have to enforce your beliefs.

&gt; Like the drowning thing, if we apply the Golden Rule to the drowning thing, the logical thing is to save the drowning man, correct? Yet you try to apply the same result to things like marriage decisions, stupid business decisions, gambling debt, and foreseeable accidents. You can't deal in absolutes.

And it must. Why would it not? The examples you give don't make any sense to me; at least not the way you presented them.

&gt; You asked, I answered; you don't get it or you're not accepting it.

There's nothing that you've really presented. But let me try to be as excruciatingly explicit as possible. First, however -

&gt; No! That's not how it works in my AnCap system!

I never said this.

Okay, let me use your definitions, where capitalism is defined as a system that respects private ownership, and socialism respects worker ownership. First, it should be noted that without any other caveats, these are the exact same goddamn thing. Workers are private individuals (in the sense of ""public"" referring to a State), just as the business owners are. As human beings, they are equal.

For a specific example, let's choose an OS engineer at Apple. Totally hypothetical. Now, in a capitalist system, this man has been hired by Apple, Inc. to write software. He is provided with a salary, extensive knowledge of the underpinnings of OS X, as well as a huge codebase to work with. Here the codebase is the capital; without it, he could not extend or improve it (duh). In exchange, he will spend his time working on OS X, and give up the ownership of any code he writes to Apple. Additionally, it should be noted that Apple is essentially a large cooperative. People work together for a common goal; often sacrificing more than their contract requires.

Now, in a socialist system, this man is ""hired"" (is this even the right word?) by Apple, Inc. to write software. But here, the codebase of OS X is somehow that worker's fundamental right, because he isn't required to trade anything to use it. Otherwise, this would be capitalism. The problem with assuming that you some fundamental right to capital is that you can very quickly get a contradiction, as I'm sure you know. Additionally, as soon as he works on OS X, he owns it. But ownership is a slippery concept, and rather useless; what benefit does he gain from owning a piece of the codebase? He can't sell it, because by itself, it's useless. Can you imagine selling the part of a house that a single worker constructed? You'd get bits and pieces; no house.

So to gain any benefit from it, he needs to somehow trade the whole OS in the marketplace. His only option is to team up with his fellow engineers that own the other pieces, and figure out to sell it as a whole. But there are hundreds of others; they might spend more time figuring out how to do all this than actually improving the OS. Sure, they could do it, but it wouldn't work very well. (See any number of failed open-source projects.) So what do they do? They ask someone to oversee them and organize the process. Collectively, they give their rights to each part of the codebase to this new guy, in exchange for a piece of the money he can get from selling it. Now we're back at capitalism. Even open-source projects like Mozilla and Linux do this, because it simply does not work otherwise.

My points are essentially these -

1) How can you guarantee that no one in your mutualist society would want to follow the path I just described back to capitalism?

2) Denying ""private"" ownership is just like denying ""worker"" ownership, but being arbitrarily selective about who you consider a worker.

3) There is nothing about socialism to ""not get"". It's a subset of capitalism, with an element of class warfare.

"c7nouhz","&gt;Then what's wrong with capitalism? 

Hierarchy. It creates a ""ruling"" class in owners with a ""subservient"" class of workers. As mutualists, we're anarchists, thus we oppose this. 

&gt;And here's the part you lose me on.

Fine... Private ownership, the worker does not own; he works and receives a wage (or none in slavery). Worker ownership, anyone who works, is an owner. 

This is the difference.

&gt;because there's a forbidden market action 

It's not forbidden. It's just that as soon as there's capitalist ownership, it ceases to be market socialism. Just as in free market capitalism there's no such thing as a coop or a credit union, because as soon as one of those emerges, it's technically no longer capitalism.

The most common form is a socialist/capitalist mix.

&gt;. Less people can potentially benefit, because there can be no - as you would call it - capitalist.

But fewer people have access to capital in capitalism. More money is spread around for use in circulation when it's worker owned and profits are shared.

In socialism, more people benefit. There's fewer super rich and fewer destitute poor. There's still poor and still rich, but they're not as poor nor as rich. It is naturally spread around as opposed to forcibly like in communism.

&gt;I'm starting to see how you guys use that to avoid saying anything that could later be used to show a contradiction in your beliefs.

And you guys dealing in absolutes make it seem like if something might apply in some strange and rare scenario, then it must apply in all scenarios. 

Like the drowning thing, if we apply the Golden Rule to the drowning thing, the logical thing is to save the drowning man, correct? Yet you try to apply the same result to things like marriage decisions, stupid business decisions, gambling debt, and foreseeable accidents. You can't deal in absolutes. 

Most everything needs to be looked at on its own merit, applied in a way the is most beneficial. Just because we did something in one situation, doesn't mean we *must* repeat it every time after that.

&gt;Again, there is no difference here. Your above example is a false idea of capitalism, even by your own definition.

Fine, you're a capitalist, not a mutualist. You don't have to understand. You asked, I answered; you don't get it or you're not accepting it. It's cool, I'm not here to convert or even defend for that matter. I'm just trying to answer questions that are being asked. 

If things are unclear, I'm willing to clear them up. But when I answer a question, you don't get to say: *No! That's not how it works in my AnCap system!*",1356763344,"there's fewer super rich and fewer destitute poor.","rich and fewer","rich",NA,FALSE,"super rich and few","few","super",NA,1
"c7ngtvl","I think you're wrong about it being ""who you really are.""  It's more like the single face you're comfortable showing the world.  I also think you're wrong to make such a sharp distinction between who you are and what you have to offer other people.  Still, supposing you're right about it being a matter of identity, you're wrong (I keep saying that, sorry) that people who like who you are and enjoy your personality will necessarily be fine with you acting that way all the time.

For example, even supposing the OP only cares about people who enjoy his sense of humor, he still must consider the pleasure of others who do not.  If his best friend's wife finds his sense of humor extremely unpleasant, he may not give a shit about *her*, but every time his friend wants to invite him over to a party or a get-together, he'll have to argue with his wife about it, and if the OP comes over and puts his wife in a bad mood, he has to deal with an unhappy wife.  You can blame the wife for this, but treating her as something beyond control and therefore a given, the OP would be putting his friend through a lot of unpleasantness, just because he's too obstinate to alter his manners around the guy's wife.  OP's friend would not be pleased with his behavior.

As an illustration, *Pride and Prejudice* presents a similar case of a man who only has one rather unpleasant face to show the world.  Mr. Darcy is handsome and rich, but also prideful and cynical.  This is his first appearance in the novel, at a party:

&gt; The gentlemen pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man, the ladies declared he was much handsomer than Mr. Bingley, and he was looked at with great admiration for about half the evening, till his manners gave a disgust which turned the tide of his popularity; for he was discovered to be proud; to be above his company, and above being pleased; and not all his large estate in Derbyshire could then save him from having a most forbidding, disagreeable countenance....

Elizabeth Bennet, the protagonist, is as repulsed by his manners as everyone else.  Around the middle of the novel, she has this to say to him:

&gt; ""From the very beginning--from the first moment, I may almost say--of my acquaintance with you, your manners, impressing me with the fullest belief of your arrogance, your conceit, and your selfish disdain of the feelings of others, were such as to form the groundwork of disapprobation on which succeeding events have built so immovable a dislike....""

From that you might think she must be an entirely different kind of person, with no sympathy for him.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  She's just as cynical and judgmental as he is.  In her own words:

&gt; ""Do not be afraid of my running into any excess, of my encroaching on your privilege of universal good-will. You need not. There are few people whom I really love, and still fewer of whom I think well. The more I see of the world, the more am I dissatisfied with it; and every day confirms my belief of the inconsistency of all human characters, and of the little dependence that can be placed on the appearance of merit or sense.""

In fact, when she delivers the rebuke I quoted above, she has already fallen in love with him, and he with her.  Elizabeth and Darcy are soul mates from the start, but his one-note way of relating to people keeps them from getting to the point, and without a little good fortune, it would have kept them apart forever.  

The difference between Elizabeth and Darcy is that she considers the effect that manners have on other people, while he behaves with ""selfish disdain of the feelings of others.""  Darcy has made the mistake of treating his moods and behavior as equivalent to his personal convictions, thereby elevating them from a matter of manners to a matter of conscience and integrity.  That is self-justifying, self-aggrandizing bullshit, and Elizabeth rightly corrects him.  His manners *aren't* a matter of personal integrity and *do* affect other people; therefore, he must balance his own desires with the pleasure of others.

Sure you pay a little more for housing, but for about $200 more I have a fantastic frontseatview of the beach and fireworks, not to mention virtually no heating bill (gas bill in albrrrta was ~$250 one cold month)! No chance of accidentally freezing to death in -60 winters. 

My whoregers cell bill is still cheaper, service is better, internet is fassa (at least you get to have more options).

Food? Vancouver is bliss. You can't beat the price and variety. Where I used to live, you could never purchase any decent sushi for under ~$8...forget about fresh produce/seafood/various ethnic cuisines. 

I cut back on drinking when I moved here mostly because of $$, but hey, it's healthier! And besides, Vancouver has other recreational activities to enjoy ;)

I sold my car, and transit is awesome. A transit pass + occasional taxi ride/zipcar is still cheaper than car+maintainence+insurance+gas+random shit that you have to pay for with a car. Walking/biking = healthier! healthier also = cheaper!

And lastly, you can't put a price on the quality of life. I choose my moderate life/apartment here than waking up every day rich but miserable (cold/bored/ugly as fuck outside). At least if I'm broke here, I can still go out to the beach for free and chill.

"c5bffci","&gt;is the reason why we have the Electoral College, not the reason why we have congressmen rather than direct democracy.

No, it's also one of the reasons we have congressmen. They assumed that only the leading members of each community would be elected, thereby removing the masses one level from the decision making process. Un-elected senators additionally was another layer between people and the governmental process. The U.S. government was made by rich people, for the benefit of rich people. Is this any surprise?

&gt;So if our government were based off of a government that favored the poor over the rich, how did we get to a government that favors the rich over the poor? I think that has more to do with capitalism than politics, personally. 

Your knowledge of Greek history is tenuous. That wikipedia article is not very good, either. The main fear of Greek democracy, to the Greeks, was not fear of poor people terrorizing the rich, but instead charismatic people using demagoguery for their own advantage. You know, like Pericles. Let's also not forget that the Greek definition of ""citizen"" is far different than our own. The amount of people who actually could vote or participate was much, much smaller than modern day ideas.

While our government took the basics of Athenian representative democracy, the founders added a number of things to make the will of the people less important, mainly to avoid some charismatic person using them to take power. The more accurate comparison to ancient history (And the example that the founding fathers borrowed more from) is the Roman Senate, though, who were supposedly ""enlightened"" aristocrats in charge of the country.

I wish they'd just make an omnibus with all four but it would be about... eh... 12-1500 pages. It was written as one novel then broken up by the publisher. All of them are fantastic. The story only gets better as you read. But, have a dictionary or google on hand as there are *a lot* of archaic words. The story takes place in the far-future, and as such Gene Wolfe includes a note in the preface that says he has translated the work from a language that ""has not yet achieved existence"".

So, this constant use of dead/retired/obscure words to describe seemingly normal things makes for some really rich but challenging sessions of reading. Some paragraphs flow smoothly like they would in any other novel but some get very difficult unless you really open yourself up to what the author is doing, which is creating an authentic (but fictional) experience of reading a confession translated from another language. The entire book, FYI, is told in the first person, as a confession...  with an unreliable narrator, who notoriously lies. GW did this in the *Latro* books, too, but they are easier to read than *New Sun*.

For example, instead of calling Severian's (the hero's, or anti-hero's, whatever) trademark cloak *black*, GW calls it *fuligin*, which means sooty. Severian refers to this as ""the color darker than black"". Also the mercury in his headsman's sword is never called mercury but *hydroganum*, the Latin name for mercury. It's little touches like this that make the book so deep, but at times it can definitely be a bitch to read if you're being lazy about it.

###Rough Gear Standards

##Act 1, entry level Inferno

Your first priorities should be to get all resist in as many slots as possible while maximising your strength.

Try to meet these minimums:

Helm, bracers, gloves, and boots: 80 strength, 30 all resist

Legs and chest(including sockets): 140 strength, 30 all resist

Shoulders, belt, and neck: 120 strength, 30 all resist

Rings: 70 strength, 20 all resist

Weapon: 1100 DPS

(remember: you can lose the all resist in a few slots in favor of bonus armor to save gold)

Each of these can be found for about 50k per slot.



##Act 2 and beyond

Focus on making upgrades that increase strength and/or mitigation and start watching for secondary stats.  Even after 1.0.3, attack speed is still very good on rings.  Try to balance your crit chance and crit damage, a ratio of around 1 to 5 is an okay rule of thumb.

By the time you finish act 2, you should be looking at about 25k damage, 600 resist all (with warcry), and 30k HP.  For Act 3 and 4, try to have around 35k damage, 800 resist all (with warcry), and 35k HP before you seriously commit to finishing and farming them.

---

###Auction House Tips

##Mechanical stuff:

1)  If you're not interested in chasing a bid, put in a maximum buyout so you don't have to go through pages of bid-only auctions if you sort buyout ascending.

2)  Most of the time, looking at auctions older than an hour or two is a waste of gold.  If an auction is that old, other people have likely already looked at it and decided it's not worth buying.  Niche/unpopular items can be the exception to this rule (for example: Barb gear without all resist)

3)  You can bookmark bid-only auctions by bidding more gold than what you have.  Your bid will fail, but the auction will show up under your auctions tab.

4)  The way the bidding system works, if you bid higher than the incremental bid increase (the bid that shows up when you press the button), the AH will automatically compete with other bids until it reaches the value you bid as maximum.  So for example, if you decide an item is worth 2million gold, but the bid is only at 1million, you can lay down a 2million bid and if nobody else bids on it, you'll end up paying only 1million.  The remaining 1 million will get refunded to you when the auction completes.

5)  Searching for legendaries:  If you're looking for a particular legendary but don't want to have to look through 50 pages for a particular random attribute, do this: set the quality to legendary (sets are also considered legendary), set the level min and max to whatever the legendary is, set one or two of the affixes to one or two of the predetermined stats on the legendary, then choose whatever random affix you want.

For example:  You want a Lamentation with 50 all resist and frenzy damage.  Choose mighty belt legendary, level 60-60, Lifesteal&gt;0, Barbarian skill Frenzy&gt;0, All resist&gt;50.

##Specific AH queries:

*Chests*:  I'd almost always recommend a bonus armor chest over an all resist chest since the difference in gold between the two tends to be huge.  Since chests have no secondary damage stats, finding one with physical or fire resist isn't very hard.

Example chest query:  Strength&gt;120, Has sockets&gt;3, Armor&gt;0.  Sort armor descending and look for ones with either physical or fire resist.

*Helms*:  A purple gem is going to almost always be worth at least 100 VIT and sockets tend to cost less than vitality.  If you don't have the gold to throw down on a helm with both VIT and a socket, lean toward just a socket.

*Amulets*:  Amulets are another slot that I would recommend watching for +armor items if all resist is too expensive for you.  Amulets can have very high strength, crit chance, and crit damage, so there's potential to spend a lot on damage stats even if you're resorting to bonus armor.



##Legendaries to watch for:
There's a number of legendaries that can either be really good mid to high end gear choices.  By the time you're looking to start Act 3, you should consider scouring the AH for some of these legendaries:


**Sage's Seekers** with strength or strength+vitality

http://us.battle.net/d3/en/artisan/blacksmith/recipe/sages-seekers

These boots come with decent all resist, bonus armor, and movespeed.  Rares can be comparable/better, but you're looking for 4-5 properties wheras Sage's Seekers are mass crafted by a lot of people and are easy to find.


**Firewalkers** with all resist and high strength

http://us.battle.net/d3/en/item/fire-walkers

These are the ""I've got too much gold"" version of the Sage's Seekers.  You can find firewalkers with well over 200 strength and up to 80 all resist, but you're going to be paying A LOT.  They're worth a mention for the uber rich, but most people should stick to Sage's Seekers.


**Lamentation** with all resist and either bash or frenzy damage.

http://us.battle.net/d3/en/item/lamentation

This is a staple at higher gear levels.  Up to 12% on your primary attack, lifesteal, a good amount of strength, and a legendary-only 1% crit.  You could potentially find comparable rares, but it's another case of having to look for a lot of properties.


**Andariel's Visage** with strength

http://us.battle.net/d3/en/item/andariels-visage

This helm is nice for a few reasons: 1) Reasonably priced helms are a pain in the neck to find on the AH.  2) If you can spare the all resist and vit, you can get a raw strength Andy's for pretty cheap and it's a pretty huge amount of damage  3) If you are willing to pay a good bit, you can still get one with resists or health.  Andy's fills a niche on the low and medium gear spectrums for one looking for high damage on a helm.


**Hierophant's Seal** with all resist

http://us.battle.net/d3/en/item/hierophants-seal

If you're doing a lot of Act 3, the bonus damage vs demons on this ring is highly underrated.  The other preset properties are not bad either.  You can often find these rings for very cheap considering how much damage you'll gain.

**2Piece Natalya's** with strength on boots and strength+allresist on ring

http://us.battle.net/d3/en/item/natalyas-soul

http://us.battle.net/d3/en/item/natalyas-mark

The 2piece bonus for Natalya's is awesome (7% crit).  However, given the new increased demand from demon hunters looking for the 4piece, acquiring even a strength version of this set is ridiculously expensive.  This is another super high-end expensive pickup.

---

###Inferno Diablo
Here's the build I used:

http://us.battle.net/d3/en/calculator/barbarian#WUjPRk!ZYb!cbaZbc

The changes from the standard cooldown build are:

*Sprint in place of Seismic slam* - The reasoning here is that other than melee attacks, 100% of the damage on the fight is avoidable. Sprint in circles and wait for ignore pain and/or your other cooldowns to come up and you'll win.

*Call of Ancients in place of Earthquake* - The duration on COA is longer than earthquake, so you can spread out your damage more in phase 2. I actually managed to make my first COA of phase 2 get me through two of the shades. I used the damage/armor rune, but I think that the duration rune would be just as good, if not better.

I can't really say too much about the fight since I found it to be pretty easy, but the important things I found were:

1) Pop cooldowns right at the start of the fight to burn through phase 1 but then STOP and wait for you cooldowns before going into phase 2.

2) Manage cooldowns in phase 2 such that you have one for every shade. If you can get to phase 3 the fight's pretty much yours.

3) Free melee time in phase 3 when Diablo casts the lightning inferno. Just sprint behind him and whoop his ass for a few seconds.

4) Dodge the bone cages and fire void zones or you'll lose.

Lastly, if you don't plan on going in with nephelem valor, you can charge up full fury in town with this little trick:

- Switch one of your passives to Unforgiving.

- Switch your shout rune to Charge

- Pop your shout, wait for it to cooldown, switch the rune back to Impunity and shout again

- Switch Unforgiving back out for your original passive

Now you get to start the boss at full fury and get your burn on that much quicker, yay!",1340905820,"they're worth a mention for the uber rich, but most people should stick to sage's seekers.","rich, but most","rich","but",TRUE,"rich , but most","most",NA,NA,1

"c56mw7c","Living in the suburbs, no catcalls at all. Worked in a somewhat janky grocery store on a less rich but still middle class side of town, and i got some awkward and uncomfortable advances but nothing overly aggressive. Moved to Savannah, GA for college, where walking and public transit were my only means of transport, all the damn time. Especially on the poorer side of town where my dorms were the last two years living there. 

I had an experience where I was honked at by a passing driver on a busy street while walking back from the school building to my dorm - only 2 blocks. No big deal, its happened before, though it was creepy the way his head turned, tracking me as he sped passed. I cross the street and go to turn down the usually empty side street, and i see the same car quickly turn into it before i get there, and I can tell he slows to a stop even though hes out of sight around the corner. He must have done a U turn at the intersection to get to that sidestreet. Either way, I turned around and stood beside the busiest part of the street in view of the college building and called up my largest guy friend to escort me home. Dont know if creepo was after my purse and laptop, or just me, but either way I did not want to find out. Dude was gone by the time my friend showed up. Also, this was 7pm in the summer, so it was still completely daylight outside.

That was my only experience that seemed to go further than just cat calling. It was pretty shocking to me how often verbal harassment happened though, having not really experienced it prior to that time.

"c54dmop","I grew up in a small rural city of about 100,000 people and the girls I knew through high school definitely didn't use much make-up, nor did they know how to really maximise their natural assets or big occasions or whatever. Lots of them wore no make-up 99% of the time, and then on prom night they would turn up looking like a clown or a whore, just by mistake.

Then, when I was almost 20 I moved to a city of about a million people. I met a girl at a bar one night and got her number. That's an *incredibly* rare event for me, possibly the only time I have done that in my entire life. But she was gorgeous and funny in the bar, so I was happy when she agreed to go out for a date when I called her. 

I arrived at her place mid-afternoon for some reason - I guess whatever I was taking her to was early - and was totally surprised to see she had gone to the effort of making herself up for our date. 'Back home' the girls I had grown up with just wouldn't bother getting made up for something that wasn't evening or formal.

I was actually really happy just because I thought it meant she liked me enough to go through that extra effort. It gave me a ton of confidence that no doubt helped me out during the night - she was definitely out of my league in terms of her looks (and I later learned her previous boyfriends were all older and rich), but we lived together for 5 years, so that first date was obviously a success.

But, to my combined dismay and embarrassment, I realised after a few weeks that on that occasion she was actually not making any special effort for me at all. She wore that much make-up every single day of her life no matter what she was doing, and that was just the culture she grew up with - she had 2 sisters exactly the same, her mom was the same, her maternal grandmother still wore makeup every day in her nineties. Kind of like that Zsa Zsa Gabor quote about no man having seen her natural face in 50 years.

In the end, that stuff was a large part of what drove us apart. I can't help but lose respect for women who feel it's somehow wrong or scary to go out in public unpainted. But from experience I know it's lazy and stupid to write someone off for that, or pigeon-hole them based on that aspect of their personality. The attitudes to make-up and it's use, or over-use, are inherited from mother to daughter and further influenced by a myriad of other factors for a woman's entire life. When people grow up and form their adult opinions about important subjects, they can change dramatically as people on the inside without ever changing their make-up habits they grew up with.

So the way someone wears make-up, how much of it, and how often, just isn't really a very useful guide to anything else about them.

What really bothers me about make-up is just how many women don't really know much about it. I'm  a guy, so obviously I have no practical experience of the subject. But I have a weird fascination with the many thousands of YouTube make-up 'how-to' videos... I can watch this stuff all day and not get too bored, for some reason. But I've seen and learned enough to look at some members of the public and feel so, so, sorry for them. They just don't know any better.

"c4z609r","If you think of the stock market as a completely government controlled ponzi scheme, where the government knows what the future of that computer program will look like, it explains a lot.  They can craft large events around future drops and increases to make it look like the market is legit.  At some point in the future the market will be gone, because that is the fail safe, the government decided it had X number of years to defeat the soviet union, otherwise war would be necessary and in that case the market would be destroyed anyway.  The economic 'strife' while we purchase billion dollar stealth warships is a STORY crafted to justify market moves.

9/11 was simply a future market drop that had to be justified by an event.  Think:  if the market dropped 3000 points in two months in september of 2001 and October 2001, for no reason, what would people do?  Lose complete confidence and question the bigger than madoff ponzi scheme that is the stock market.

Same thing in 2008, if that drop occurred without the banks being blamed and the 'economic meltdown story', people would question why the market lost more than 1/2 its value for no reason.  Then the ponzi scheme would be discovered.

The people behind the market ponzi scheme are the people behind 9/11 and every other disaster in the past, and in the future. Because if you know what the market is going to do because you wrote the program that it follows, you can be infinitely rich, and at that point who cares about freedom or saftey or anybody...

Think about it, it makes sense, the same way madoff couldn't turn off his ponzi scheme, the US Government can't turn off the market that is a complete fraud, and they are slaves to the future moves that they can't stop because the ups and downs are prewritten in case wars with the soviet union were necessary in this century, which they so far haven't been.

Now you understand why prominent people stopped flying before 9/11, or didn't show up for work that day, or left the building before the planes hit for a 'dentist appointment', they knew something was going to happen, maybe they didn't know exactly what... but if you knew the market would drop 2000 points tomorrow for no foreseable reason, you would suspect a disaster of some sort that you dont' want to be part of.  Knowing the future of the fake stock market computer program keeps these people not only rich but safe, and those in charge of creating the events that 'justify' to the sleepy public these drops in share prices morally justify to themselves that keeping a fake market going is better than keeping no market at all and telling that truth.

Imagine if Obama came out and said, ""hey the market is a fake"" or somebody trying to tell this truth about why 9/11 happened, they'd be ostracized and criticized and smeared before the words left five feet from their lips.  As long as everyone believes that the market is real then its OK, but the market has an end and that is why all the saftey measures are being put in place so the NEW MARKET that is actually real can be restarted once this fake one ends at zero.

An untimely accident or sickness alone can cost an individual more than they make in a year, and disable them from work besides.

You need to see something positive? Their is tons of positivity coming out of Pakistan but you choose to only see the negativity, you like to perceive whatever fits your negative view. 

**All non-Ahmadis with Hijabs are fundamentalists listening to some uneducated mullah for religious education.**

Seeing you're unlike many other Ahmadis, you like to assume everyone is evil, its your loss, many of those girls have open views, many are friends with Muslims (Ahmadis included), Jews, Christians, and people of other beliefs.

**Majority of Ahmadis are poor, you don't see them carrying out immoral anti-Islamic acts. This link about poverty and being a evil bastard doesn't stick mate, everybody knows right from wrong, killing Ahmadis has nothing to do with being poor.**

Wrong again mate the Majority of Ahmadis are not poor, they may not be rich but few fall into the category of poverty. The ones who kill Ahmadis and others are children whose parents cannot afford to send them to school, they then send their kids to a madrasa run by some daft mullah. The kids sense of morality is warped, he is then a mindless pawn in the hand of a mullah. This does happen because these people lack resources to help children.

Hating does little else but add fuel to the fire, learn some key principles seen throughout history (Martin Luther King Jr.), men who hate achieve little to nothing.

"c4sh2lf","I forget what episode, but Marco Arment said on Build and Analyze these things about pricing, which I agree with:

1. You don't want free. Ads suck ass. Don't subject your users to that crap. Also, free will dramatically increase the likelyhood of dumb 1 star reviews because there is no barrier to entry to weed out the idiot users. $.99 at least weeds those out. Also, it dramatically decreases your support costs because those same users who will need the most support (dumb people) are also the ones most likely to not appreciate good software and therefore only download free apps.

2. Users will perceive your app is a better quality app. Yes, you may lose 10-20% of your market because of shallow folks (or teenagers/students with little money) who refuse to pay more than $.99 for an app, but you more than make up for it by doubling or tripling your price.

3. Marco in the podcast above, on one particular episode (it was in 2012 I believe so you shouldn't have to hunt too far back to find it) said that there is little to no drop-off from $2.99 to $1.99 in sales when pricing. I forget which but either he or another dev he read about tried it out.

Basically, you'll attract ""better"" users (more sophisticated, richer [not Mitt Romney rich, but more likely to be employed adults]) who will probably need less support and appreciate your app more as they are willing to pay for quality apps.

"c4jmunc","The Old Testament speaks of slavery often and lays out rules on how slaves were to be treated. This is not condoning slavery. The Bible also speaks of divorce and specific regulation but it clearly states that God does not approve of divorce.

Both of these were facts of life in biblical times and because there are regulations for specific behaviors does NOT mean the same as approval.

Incorrect assumptions: Slavery was involuntary servitude.

Many believe that Old Testament slavery was like the modern western slavery of the 1700's or 1800's. Western slavery primarily benefited the rich, but Israelite slavery primarily benefited the poor. Self-sale, family sale, and indentured servitude was initiated by the slave as a remedy for poverty. They agreed to work in exchange for ecnomic security and personal protection.

Incorrect assumption: Slavery was cruel and inhumane

Old Testament forbids the cruel treatment of slaves and they were afforded the same legal protection as free citizens. Read Leviticus 25. Many slaves were treated as members of the owner's family. Read Deuteronomy 15.

Incorrect assumption: It was okay to harm a slave

If a master beat his slave and he died, the master was to be killed. If he caused some sort of permanent damage (even including knocking out a tooth), the slave was to be set free immediately.

Using a rod to discipline a slave or a rebellious son was a common form of punishment much like a belt or switch we use to use on our own children for discipline. Punishment that caused harm is the same as it is today for child abuse.

Incorrect assumption: Women were sex slaves

Women were sometimes sold into slavery as concubines but she was not held against her will and used for sex. She was a true wife and the man who bought her was her husband. Polygamy was not enforced servitude. In most cases the relationship allowed the women to escape poverty, offered security and protection, and gave them social mobility within the home of a wealthy family.

Incorrect assumption: Old Testament condones involuntary slavery

It is clear in the Old Testament that involuntary slavery was punishable by death and considered evil. Refer to Exodus 21:6 and Deuteronomy 24:7

Let's stick with CMG before making this discussion too theoretical. An investor who bought into the company before it exploded either:

1. Was lucky (good timing + good choosing)
2. Had a reason to believe Chipotle would explode (a gap in the market for low-cost retail Mexican food restaurants, slipping profitability with competitors, public boredom with competitors' offerings)
3. Saw a bump, rode the wave, and kept riding it.

Number 3 may seem the best option to you, but it's in many ways the riskiest. Luck can't be controlled, and knowing the value of a company and the makeup of its market is that sort of competitive edge that makes people like Buffett rich.

&gt; All I was saying was that not all occupations contribute to society at equivalent levels. Growing up, my family had insurance through my parent's work, and we were not super rich, but we still got good healthcare.

The difference between recognizing contributions and denying health care begins where?  Charging exorbitant amounts and limiting the licensing of doctors?  Lobbying Congress for an explicit ban of low-priced import drugs for already profitable ventures/companies?

You have not objectively evaluated the cesspool of corruption that the current socialized system embraced *before* Obamacare, including Medicare Part D.  Your complaints, such as socialized care 'harming business' requires the specific US implementation of HMOs from 1974 to actually be perceived as 'harmful.'  You ignore the current burden which businesses would not bear in a single-payer or even just a more optimized and efficient administrative regime.

&gt; You're making it seem as though this country would enter a harsh state of lawlessness and killing without fully socialized healthcare. Maybe you should get in touch with reality and think about the fact that that isn't the case at all.

&gt; you're making it seem as though I'm arguing for a wider gap between the rich and poor, which I'm definitely not. I'm just arguing against fully socialized medical care. Can you stop with the straw men?

The rules of economics dictate that, within 20 years, if you continue thinking the way you do, your doctors will *leave* for a society that provides a better community and life for them.  You will be just as (mentally) sick and without treatment as you are now, except older and less capable of coping on your own.

Actually yes.

If you are making the level of income that required that level tax, you were not hurting. What, you couldn't just buy a new yacht when the sanitary tanks got full anymore? No more using hundred dollar bills for toilet paper?

I didn't get into Stanford, hired by Boeing, or invited to join a structures research department... by goofing off. It took a lot of work. (And hey, I think you work a lot harder than I do).
&gt;
&gt;However… There are a couple of factors that you're not taking into account.
&gt;
&gt;1) Hard work does not ensure success, and hard work is sometimes not required for success. In other words, a lot of people get very unlucky, and a lot of people get very lucky. Heck, I'm very lucky: Would I be in the career that I am if my parents could not have afforded a very expensive education for me? Maybe, maybe not. Even if I could have gotten student loans for college, lots of kids just don't get to go to a great high school like mine, where you get to learn college-level physics and math from passionate and smart teachers who only have to deal with small groups of well-behaved kids. So I was lucky. Its damn near impossible to become very successful today if you don't have that luck while you're a kid. And that's not fair. You said so yourself: Life's not fair. People should do what they can to change that.
&gt;
&gt;2) You misunderstand what the ""99%"" people are complaining about. They're not saying ""I deserve success as a basic right, even if I just bum around"". They're saying ""I've been working my butt off for YEARS, doing EVERYTHING that I've been told to do, but I did not get the rewards I was promised, I did not get a job, I now have more debt than I will ever be able to get rid of"". I beg you to go look at the posts where these protesters describe the fuel behind their dissatisfaction. Here's a URL. Millions of people in the US work hard their whole lives and are extremely frugal, but live paycheck to paycheck and cannot afford health care. A major injury/illness would completely bankrupt them.
&gt;
&gt;http://wearethe99percent.tumblr.com/page/2
&gt;
&gt;Many people's response to the protesters is ""I had it rough too, but I was able to pull myself out of it through hard work. It was very hard. You can do it too, if you just stop whining"". But that is simply not true. For some people, finding any source of money AT ALL is IMPOSSIBLE. For many people, there is simply no paying work in sight that would offer enough of an income to pay for food and health insurance and a fraction of the cost of renting a small place.
&gt;
&gt;You can say ""I did it, they can do it too"", but it's simply not true. Read these stories about people who cannot afford to pay to heat their homes or to treat their illnesses. It's not because they're lazy, it's not because they consider it to be ""beneath them"" to work as a waitress or gardener or grocery-bagger. It's because not even those opportunities are available to them.
&gt;
&gt;Why not? Because we're going through a recession. Why? Because big banks got too greedy and gambled more money than they were worth, on the willingness/ability of poor people to pay their mortgages and on the hypothesis that house prices always rise. And when they lost that bet, the government got all of us, taxpayers, to cover the cost of this mad unsuccessful gambling. This opened up a lot of people's eyes to how all kinds of industries (most prominently banking, but all other big companies, e.g. aerospace manufacturers like my employer) spend way too much money lobbying the government into passing laws that allow them to make more money for their shareholders, at a detriment to society in general.
&gt;
&gt;It was once thought that what's good for big business is good for America. But that's simply not true. What's good for big business is good for investors, which is basically the very rich, but bad for most of the population. Big businesses have forgotten all their civil and social duties and have become machines purely driven by the motive to move money to their investors, doing whatever the law allows (and even things that the law does not allow, if the cost of the fine is lower than the cost of doing things differently). I, for one, am embarrassed that Boeing spends so much money trying (often successfully) to convince the US government that certain piles of money are better spent buying military jets than feeding/housing/insuring/educating the poor. I, and most citizens, would be ok with Boeing doing a little bit worse this year, if it meant that things get less painful for the Americans at the bottom of society. But big businesses have insulated themselves from such civil/social demands. But if Boeing were about to go under, you bet that we would ask the government to basically prop us up using taxpayer money.
&gt;
&gt;Big businesses socialize their costs/risks... but capitalize on their successes. That's not fair.
&gt;
&gt;Big businesses insit that markets will regulate themselves, that competition is important… but when they're about to fail, they tell the government: American society needs us to succeed, so please give us money or bend the rules in our favor. That's not fair.
&gt;
&gt;Either we regulate markets so that businesses aren't too detrimental to society… or we stand back and watch the giants knock each other down. They can't have their cake and eat it too. Which they currently do.
&gt;
&gt;When business is slow for you, do you get a bail-out of taxpayer money?
&gt;
&gt;I didn't think so.
&gt;
&gt;Big companies do.
&gt;
&gt;And that's not fair.
&gt;
&gt;Where's YOUR bail-out?
&gt;
&gt;It's not the poor or middle-class people who want something for nothing. It's the investors and managers of big companies. And guess what: They DO get something for nothing. Even worse: They get billions of dollars for FAILING, for losing gambles, for failing to serve their customers.
&gt;
&gt;Is that fair?

"c2s1smc","Yes, I am saying that libraries exist in a perpetual love/hate relationship with the publishing industry.  With a few glaring recent examples (cough cough Authors' Guild), authors themselves have been great lovers of libraries and vice versa.  The Long Tail of commerce may make Amazon rich, but many authors who do not achieve blockbuster status are nevertheless able to keep plying their trade thanks to librarians who painstakingly add their books to the shelves.  Also, academic publishing simply would cease to exist if libraries were not there to purchase scholarly monographs from university publishing houses and peer-reviewed periodicals.  But just because many content providers understand that libraries actually help their bottom line doesn't mean that the industry as a whole wants to move everyone to a pay-per-view model of licensing content.  

To nitpick, however:  Fair Use, First Sale, and other key concepts that permit libraries and academic institutions to facilitate research are not loopholes in copyright law, but specific exemptions that were carved out by Congress to balance out the rights of intellectual property holders with the common good.  I believe that copyright was once a productive force here in the US toward the expansion of human knowledge, and that it still might not be too late to return it to these noble roots.  Unlike individuals engaging in anonymous file-sharing,  however, libraries and universities simply cannot disregard existing copyright law because they happen to disagree with it, mostly because they'll get the living shit sued out of them (see the [Georgia State copyright case](http://chronicle.com/article/Whats-at-Stake-in-the-Georgia/127718/) for more info).  Therefore it's our job as librarians to educate people in how to claim everything that copyright law does allow them while advocating for reform on national and international fronts.

I appreciate that you have constructed a moral code by which ignoring copyright law is considered to be no big deal, but for those of us who work in copyright's crosshairs we have no choice but to worry about these things.  That being said, I do find your speculation that greater use of libraries may in fact fuel a backlash from the content creators to be an interesting theory, as libraries are currently experiencing both an explosion in usage as well as our worst legal challenges in decades.

I even stated, which you failed to address, that it is good that a child be given the tools to make their own way in life. If this means money for an education or to start a business, then that is great. My query is with the seeming cognitive dissonance of promoting rugged individualism and not relying on other people and the state, and then dropping money into someones lap who didn't work for it.

Who are we to question the judgment of the person who obviously exercised previous good judgment throughout their life?

As I said, if they are unworthy, they will fail. It fixes itself. Money is not the panacea you think it is. You have to know how to use it.

&gt;Yes I do. Being successful financial says nothing about a person as a whole. You can get very rich, but incredibly thick people who, outside of the financial arena couldn't tell their arse from their fucking elbows. So yes, I don't think, that just because they are good at accruing wealth they should just be trusted.

So what's your concern? That their child will turn into an evil megalomaniac who tries to take over the world, and will only be able to do so because of the head start daddy gave them?

&gt;Some people might also find it redistributing wealth to the lower classes is unfair. If money isn't an advantage in and of itself then once they have the money to get a decent education they should be ""rugged indiviuals"" and make their own way instead of living off daddies deathh bonus.

Who are you to say they are unworthy of managing that money? That's what the market is for. It will determine their worthiness.

&gt;You're absolutely right. And helping out people at a disadvantage, people in a bit of a rut in their lives, could benefit from getting a leg up as well from the government. Which is what thing like entitlements are suppose to be for before leeches started taking advantage.

My issue with entitlements isn't leaches taking advantage. It's that far too often they create dependencies and are used to guide desires of small groups of people. For instance, child tax credits. How many people would be up shit creek without a paddle if child tax credits were suddenly removed?

There's your dependency and your social engineering. Not good.

&gt;Don't you think the sentence I have emboldened undermines your argument. If an heir didn't work for it then they ""generally can't appreciate it and they'll probably end up losing it"".

NOT AT ALL! THAT IS EXACTLY MY POINT! It will be redistributed within the market and eventually reach the hands of people who aren't incompetent. It will do far more good that way than it ever could in the hands of the government.

&gt;Like I said in my initial post, I am not against apportioning enough wealth to the point where an heir can get a good education. In fact, people in the bracket the ""death tax"" affects have a high probability of leaving, even after tax, enough to get them the best education.

&gt;If the heir ended up poor and destitute, voila, there's another person to thrown into the welfare line. Besides, how much do you think the ""death tax"" is?

I don't care what the limit is. I think it's asinine to presume the responsibility to determine winners and losers and to step in and say ""No, you can't have that because we think it's unfair"" even though that person violated no law.

"c2h1ghv","You've already got tons of answers, but here's my take:

* America is huge--it's like several countries stitched together in terms of geography/climate and to a lesser extent, culture. The States only has three borders (two with Canada), so we can only go to Canada or Mexico. Up until a few years ago, we didn't need a passport for Canada, anyway. Canada is a fine place, but most Americans have no interest in going there--why? It's culture is very similar to ours (minus the French influence) and it's colder. Also, Americans are impossibly ignorant about Canada: we couldn't tell you the name of the PM to save our lives. As for Mexico, we don't speak their language and it's a war zone. This is to say nothing of the widespread, general dislike and distrust of Mexicans. Bear in mind, *I* don't feel this way about Canada or Mexico, but it's a common attitude. I've read that only 20% of Americans have passports--that would be about right to me, possibly a little high.

As far as traveling *abroad*, who has the money? Americans work more than any other First World people: we don't have time off, we have tons of debt, and we have too many kids. Traveling across an ocean is far too expensive.

* I have absolutely no idea what this could be... Americans are stupidly patriotic, but I don't know that we're actually hyper-sensitive about criticism like, say, the Chinese are.

* Poverty and drug laws. Americans have disenfranchised blacks so that they can't get a good education and they're poor. If you have any of the following two elements, the third will automatically follow: poverty, ill education, crime. Americans also assume that if you are poor, it's because you don't work and we got over racism a long time ago. See http://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/09/opinion/09ehrenreich.html?pagewanted=all

* It's like how it's okay for you to make fun of your little brother, but if anybody else does, it's not right. Americans really believe that this is the best country on Earth (despite, say, facts or the inherent silliness of declaring one country the unqualified best.) There's a perception that if *we* say that X is wrong with America, that's just us trying to fix it and make it even better, but if *you* say it, then you're just bashing us. This, of course, is nonsense, but *very* widespread.

* One of many, many contradictions, particularly on the part of right-wing Americas. This is a very good question and I have no good answer.

* The only thing that unites Americans as a people is an idea. The States is not like (e.g.) Armenia, where a people bound by a common language and religion have been living in the same place for thousands of years and has a rich but altogether insular national history. Nor is it like Iran where there is a legacy of a huge empire or India with a vast civilization stretching back to pre-history. The U.S. is a very deliberate and new nation which is founded around a concept rather than an ethnicity.

"c2e1s6h","Fox isn't exactly insane, they're just following their argument to it's logical end.  

Fox's narrative is that making rich people richer and making companies more profitable makes the economy better for everyone.    This isn't just wrong, it's the opposite of the truth.  They don't see that though, so for them, all these economic problems must be coming from somewhere else.  They've chosen a combination of ""lazy poor people"" and ""taxes are too high"" as their solutions.  The problem is, these ""lazy poor people"", by all measures are working harder for less than we ever have before and our taxes are actually quite low by historical measure.  Of course, it doesn't have to be true to make a compelling narrative.

To fix our economy, we must acknowledge some hard truths.  Simply taxing the rich more won't fix the problem, it will only slow it's growth.  The root of our problem is that our economy is currently designed to maximize the amount of money the rich can earn off of everyone else.  We've been trying to maximize investment returns wherever possible which means driving up the profitability of companies by doing things like allowing anti-competitive mergers, handing patents out like candy, ignoring monopolies and price fixing and cost displacement and all of these things that make an economy better for those who own companies and worse for their customers and employees.   We've instituted policies that drive house prices, food prices, health care prices, and energy prices up at the same time as we've made it attractive to move jobs overseas reducing employment and pay.

I can keep going for hours about higher education expense, the tax system, etc but the end result is that over the last 30 years our productivity per hour has grown dramatically, we're working harder, longer and more than we ever have before, and yet we still make less money and have less disposable income than we used to.  With our productivity gains, covering our basic living expenses should be easier than ever but the cost of everything we need to live is being driven higher and higher as our paychecks are in-general stagnating, or disappearing.  It's pretty obvious that the money has been going to the rich, since they have so much more of it than they used to, but since in Fox's narrative, rich people are desirable and a sign of a good economy, they need to find something else to blame things on.

Fox's only answer to this is that ""taxes are too high"" but when you look at the fact that many of these people aren't paying *any* taxes at all and still have nothing, it becomes pretty obvious that taxes aren't the problem.  So what do they do.. they claim that these people aren't *really* poor because they have refrigerators and microwaves.  It'd be goddamn hilarious if it wasn't for the hundreds of millions of people working their asses off and getting nowhere because of this shit... and as giggle-inducing as it was to see the Daily Show up there ripping them a new one, the best part was the sense of absolute outrage that came from Jon Stewart as he pointed out that all that was needed to fix our budget problem, was to take everything that the bottom half of American's had in the world away from them. 

The good news is that the country is waking up to the lie.  The concept of a ""jobless recovery"" which is good for the rich but bad for everyone else has shown that our interests aren't aligned.  People don't quite understand that they are, almost entirely opposed, but we're moving in the right direction.  We need to demand policies that are going to make companies *less* profitable, increase competition, reduce prices, return jobs to this country,  drive down the cost of living, increase competition for employees and keep money from pooling among the wealthy and *then* we'll see things get better.  We're getting there.

"c29337s","Military intervention doesn't work simply because it's most likely bound to become an endless war. As long as there is poverty, there will be people willing to give up their lives for a few years of being able to actually being able to live the life they feel they deserve - that is, a life of accessibility to luxuries reserved to those who are better off (and I'm not referring to the crazy rich, but rather simple amenities like paved roads [I can't speak for the rest of the country, but Matamoros has lots of colonias that are seriously lacking in development] and the ability to buy a small luxury every now and then. People who have spent years in economic oppression grow desperate, and at times they will attune to desperate measures.

However, I do see how military intervention has effectively weakened the cartels - this is plainly visible in the drafting methods the cartels have been utilizing (kidnappings and life threats, especially to those most vulnerable - San Fernando comes to mind). I don't think, though, that I have to point out what the cons to that are, and I don't think it's worth the price we're paying. I can't understand how Calderon is so steadfast even after 40,000 lives are, for the most part, in his hands. I feel that more than a fight for the Mexican people, he's waging a war for himself and his pride. This is strictly my interpretation.

Now, I think the solution is a combination of both, and maybe throw in a little extra. If the drugs become legalized, a blow will be blown to the finances of these cartels, even if not as much as it would've been a couple years back (as you know, protection fees and extortion, and even some legitimate business, provide a good chunk of cash for these people now), but it will be enough to make an unprofitable venture. As the money slows down, violence will most probably go up - but only for so long. Have the military pursuit these gang affiliated criminals for a while, effectively bringing down their numbers permanently and not only temporarily as it kind of is now. Finally, and most importantly, the money that is made from the legalization revenues (and perhaps even some that is saved from scaling back the military operations eventually) can be reinvested into education and welfare programs that allow for people to step out of poverty easier.

Anyway, I can't do better at this hour of the morning than drop in a quote from him on what he calls ""vulgar"" libertarianism, which is what much of the libertarian right indulges in:

'This school of libertarianism has inscribed on its banner the reactionary watchword: ""Them pore ole bosses need all the help they can get."" For every imaginable policy issue, the good guys and bad guys can be predicted with ease, by simply inverting the slogan of Animal Farm: ""Two legs good, four legs baaaad."" In every case, the good guys, the sacrificial victims of the Progressive State, are the rich and powerful. The bad guys are the consumer and the worker, acting to enrich themselves from the public treasury. As one of the most egregious examples of this tendency, consider Ayn Rand's characterization of big business as an ""oppressed minority,"" and of the Military-Industrial Complex as a ""myth or worse.""


The ideal ""free market"" society of such people, it seems, is simply actually existing capitalism, minus the regulatory and welfare state: a hyper-thyroidal version of nineteenth century robber baron capitalism, perhaps; or better yet, a society ""reformed"" by the likes of Pinochet, the Dionysius to whom Milton Friedman and the Chicago Boys played Aristotle. 


Vulgar libertarian apologists for capitalism use the term ""free market"" in an equivocal sense: they seem to have trouble remembering, from one moment to the next, whether they’re defending actually existing capitalism or free market principles. So we get the standard boilerplate article arguing that the rich can’t get rich at the expense of the poor, because ""that’s not how the free market works""--implicitly assuming that this is a free market. When prodded, they’ll grudgingly admit that the present system is not a free market, and that it includes a lot of state intervention on behalf of the rich.

As it has. And then some!

&gt;I do not believe that GDP is the best measurement to determine the quality of life in a country

Of course it isn't -- and it doesn't pretend to be a measure of ""quality of life"" at all, as any Intro econ textbook will tell you.

For instance, in 1930 life exectancy was 59 and today it is 79.  What is a year of life worth in money?  Multiply that by 20, then multiply that by the entire population, add it as a ""quality of life"" adjustment to GDP -- and you'd get absurdly, ridiculously large figures for both GDP today and annual GDP growth since 1930.

Obviously that can't be right. GDP *isn't* a quality-of-life measure.  Nobody who takes a decent intro economics course can pass it believing it is.

The only people who say it is are those who want a straw man argument to use against it for their own agenda, whatever that may be. And those who simply don't know any better -- they never passed a decent intro economics course.

&gt; I intend to show you that FIAT currency merely shifts wealth more greatly away from the middle and lower classes. 

Dude, don't bother.

Your original comment was ""look how much the national debt has grown since we left the gold standard"".  Which is as meaningless as ""look how much money has been charged to this credit card! Yikes!""  I dunno -- is it Bill Gates's credit card?

Growth of debt has *no meaning* without reference to the debtor's growth of income, or better, growth of wealth. I said that and pointed you to the corresponding growth in GDP, which is the nation's income.  

That is all. Consider it a friendly correction for future reference. I'm not going to go arguing about anything else.

But after reading what you wrote, maybe a few more friendly comments for your future reference.

&gt;A truer measurement would be what would a dollar buy you in 1913 vs. today... That is what effects the ""average"" person. Average wages in 1913: $750/yr. Average income 2005 (nearest year I could find): $28,567. 

Bureau of Labor statistics, average earnings, all employees, 2009: $44,000.  Nice web site loaded with data, check it out.

But take care, ""wages"", ""compensation"" and ""income"" are three different things.  Wages are only a (declining) part of compensation, compensation is only part of income. Be careful to compare like to like. Otherwise it's cheating.  ;-(

What was $44,000 worth in 1913 dollars? $2,030.  What was $750 in 1913 dollars worth in 2009? Only $16,250.  Also [BLS](http://data.bls.gov/cgi-bin/cpicalc.pl). So compared to your $750, the 2009 average worker was a lot better off moneywise. See, you don't have to figure this out for yourself.

&gt;If you do a little fooling around with average cost of items then vs. now, you'll find real buying power for ""average"" people hasn't changed much in that time

2.7 times better in $$ terms, inflation adjusted CPI.  But of course CPI adjustments are valid only over shortish periods of time where the basket of goods stays the same. Over longer periods the basket is replaced with better goods, so the comparison becomes invalid.

E.g., as to ""what a dollar will buy"", give the 1913 person *$1 million* a year income (1913 dollars!).  For all of that he couldn't buy a polio vaccination, smallpox vaccination, TV with 300 channels, Internet ~~porn~~ connection, the resources of a supermarket to go shop in, a car -- well, not what *we'd* call a car!, an airplane trip to Disneyworld for a vacation with the kids, novacain to cover the pain when the dentist pulled a tooth, medical screening for his wife's pregnancy, decent basketball sneakers, a decent basketball team to watch, tickets to a ""talkie"" movie, an air conditioner in summer ... etc. etc.

And life expectancy in 1913 was all of 52 -- back to no vaccinations, no medical care as we know it, much poorer food, poorer sanitation, more pollution (what did all those horses leave in the streets?) much more exposure to infectious disease, etc., etc.  Even for the super-rich. 

Hey, a lot of people might think $1 million dollars in 1913 ($22 million today by CPI) wouldn't buy even as much as, oh, $30,000 today. Even $100 million in 1913 wouldn't!  What's 27 years of life expectancy worth?

But if you think the buying power of the average person hasn't increased since 1913, OK, that's an opinion. 

CPI does become pointless over a long enough period of years.  Here's a [whole bunch of alternative calculators](http://eh.net/hmit/) to figure relative values by different means over longer periods of time.  Nifty tools there.  

&gt;the crux of my point is when you have a finite money supply it keeps everything in relative balance and limits both the power huge corporations have

What is that, an article of religious faith?  Because there's sure very little logic or empirical support for that belief.

We have a ""finite money supply"" now, of course. But back in the days of good old commodity money, we had Kings and Lords forever, and did commodity money ever reduce their power in favor of the average person?  Who owned all the gold? 

The height of the gold standard times in the USA was the aptly named Gilded Age: what were the checks on the big corporations and billionaires then?  Gold money restricted their power????  Hello??

Empirically, wealth inequality was *highest* then through about 1914, then *plunged*. It has never since gotten back anywhere near to what it was then.  (Income inequality has risen since the 1970s, if not by anywhere near as much as many claim, but that's a different thing.) 

Wealth inequality is far *smaller* now than in the late gold standard era. That is a cold fact. Now personally I don't think that has anything to do with gold/fiat money, about 10,000 other things have affected the economy since 1914.  But it sure as hell doesn't support any belief that gold money is egalitarian and politically democratic, and fiat money isn't!

Why do you guys get so fact-free emotional about the gold standard and commodity money.  The gold standard is *gone*.  It *should be gone*. Nobody wants it back. It ain't coming back. Move on to something that may make a difference.

The only thing that happened in the gold standad era to ""bring down the rich"" was the Great Depression. Yeah, it did bring down some of the rich -- but it was still the rich and powerful and the Big Corporations that survived it best by far, when you consider the 30% unemployment among average workers, living in Hoovervilles.  ""Commodity money can only make the world better!""  Tell yourself another one.    
  
&gt;Note: other sources have nominal GDP much higher for 1913-1920ish than your graph shows

Because my graph was *not* one of nominal GDP, it was *real* GDP.

Dude, you keep making mistakes like this -- you don't even know how to look up the average wage in the USA -- yet you believe you know enough to decide we should replace the world monetary system and know what would happen if we did.  C'mon.

Learn a little modesty.  Then start from the beginning and learn a little economics, from the basic level first.  Then you might come up with some informed opinions of the sort backed by empirical facts.

**Tiramisu Cake**

**Hazelnut Flourless Cake to replace Lady Fingers.**
____________________________________________________

Ingredients:

- 2x 115g/4oz softened butter

- 2x 125g or 4 1/2 oz hazelnuts or hazelnut meal

- 2x 125g or 4 1/2 oz sugar replacements. I used 2 tbsp granulated Stevia.

- 2x 4 large eggs, seperated

- 2x Zest of one orange

- 2x 30g soy or coconut flour

- 2x 125g or 4 1/2 oz ricotta cheese (you could get away with melted cream cheese)

- 2x pinch of salt

- 2x 1 tsp vanilla extract

- 2x 1 tsp nutmeg

Important Equipment:

- 28 cm/ 11 inch loose bottom flan or cheese cake tin. A springform pan would also work.

- Food processor (for whole hazelnuts)



Method:

- Preheat oven to 190 C or 375 F.

- Grease or line your cake tin and put in fridge.

- Toast hazelnuts or hazelnut meal for 5 minutes.

- If you have whole hazelnuts you will need to grind them in a food processor.

- Cream the butter and sweetener in a bowl or food processor until creamy and pale.

- Seperate your eggs if you haven't done so already. Add in egg yolks and orange zest to butter/ sweetener mix.

- Sieve in your coconut or soy flour, add in ricotta and hazelnuts. Mix well.

- In a sepearte bowl, whisk your eggs whites until stiff peaks.

- Gently fold the egg whites into the rest of the mixture.

- Pour mixture into the cake tin and bake for about 25-30 minutes.

- If you use a tooth pick to check if it's done, it should come out clean.

- Once cool, slice into desired size pieces and put in freezer for assembly.


**Cream Filling.**
________________________________________________________________

Ingredints:

- 500 mL Heavy cream or whipping cream

- 500g Mascarpone cheese

Important equipment:

- Beaters

Method:

- Pour your cream into a bowl and whip it into whipped cream. Do not over work.

- Fold Macarpone cheese into whipped cream.



**Chocolate Sauce.**
___________________________________________________________________

Ingredients:

- 100g of the darkest chocolate you can buy. I used 85% Lindt

- 1/4 cup heavy cream or whipping cream.

Important equipment:

- Double boiler, or a metal bowl that can sit nicely on a pot full of water. You can do it right 
in a sauce pan if you like, but this increases chances of messing up.

Method:

- Gently heat the cream in your double boiler or sauce pan until it is atleast above room temperature.

- Break up chocolate into small pieces and put in the warm-hot cream.

Note:

If you put both in at the same time the chocolate will sink to the bottom and melt before the 
cream does. This can give you an undesired texture and it just doesn't work out. Make sure you 
heat the cream up before adding the chocolate.



**Coffee and Optional Liquer drizzle.**
____________________________________________________________________

Ingredients:

- 1 double shot of very good espresso, cold. You can pick this up from a coffee shop if you can't 
make espresso at home, or just make a 1/4 cup of strongly brewed coffee.

- 2 shots of your own choice of liquer. I used Kahluah and Frangelico. This is entirely optional. 
This adds a significant amount of carbs to the whole thing.

Method:

- Mix cold coffee and liquer (optional).

Note: You'll need to put this in a clean condiment bottle or apply with a pastry brush or spoon.



**The good part: Assembly**
_______________________________________________________________________

Notes: Make sure your cake is frozen or very cold. You want to make your chocolate sauce and 
whipping cream shortly before assemling the cake.

- Get yourself a platter that will hold a 30 cm or 12 inch round cake.

- Plan out your cake pieces on the plate before adding anything, so you have an idea of what 
you're doing once you get started. Make sure there's gaps, but the cake will be structurally 
sound. I felt like I was setting up a game of Jenga.

- Clear off your plate except for the bottom layer of cake pieces. 

- Drizzle/ brush on your coffee liquid.

- Drizzle a tbps or so of your chocolate sauce over cake bits.

- Gently spread about 1/3rd of your cream, making sure to get it in between the cracks and that it 
is flat for the next layer of cake.

- Place next layer of cake pieces and repeat the above steps.

We went to 3 layers of cake pieces, finished the top layer of cream, dusted with raw cacao powder (it's sweeter) and drizzled the rest of the chocolate sauce all over the top.


With the alcohol and using coconut flour and two batches of the cake (hense the 2x in the recipe) 
we worked out the whole cake had about 100g of carbs through the whole thing. This means it's about 10g of carbs per slice if you divide by 10, but we found it could easily go for 15-20 slices becasue it's very rich and filling.

Read the entire transcript above and add: ""But hey! Life is great!"" at the end, and you'll get a good picture of the irony. Yes, there are evil people in power, and there are evil people who are rich, but anyone who's had any experience in life can tell you that rich =/= evil and powerful =/= evil. Evil people are everywhere and cause trouble for everyone, but it's so much easier for people to cry and point fingers at a particular group (look at the history of bigotry and racism in the world) than to admit that there is good and bad in every class, ideology and culture and no group is exempt.

The real question you should be asking yourself is how good is your life compared to most people in this world, be thankful that you have what you do, and then ask yourself how you can help make things even better for everyone.

Perhaps, but there is compelling evidence that [government subsidized housing construction](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_housing_in_Hong_Kong) can work.

&gt;3. Free trade is a net benefit for any country that engages in it.

I'll assume this is true for the sake of argument.  Does this make free trade a ""net benefit"" for all the individuals in the country that engages in it?  For example, lets say that over a given period of time a country which has few market barriers in place begins to outsource its labor.  In the years that follow, productivity of workers in said country rises steadily [1](http://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/28/business/28wages.html), [2](http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/09/03/business/main3228735.shtml), [3](http://news.yahoo.com/s/yblog_thelookout/20110315/bs_yblog_thelookout/huge-productivity-gains-barely-benefitting-workers) due to a number of factors (one being increased worldwide competition).  Yet, in the same period, real wage for said workers does not rise, or rises very little [1](http://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/28/business/28wages.html), [2](http://news.yahoo.com/s/yblog_thelookout/20110315/bs_yblog_thelookout/huge-productivity-gains-barely-benefitting-workers), [3](http://www.kyklosproductions.com/articles/wages.html), [4](http://mrzine.monthlyreview.org/2006/wolff120606.html).  The net result?  Income inequality in said country [reaches record levels](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income_inequality_in_the_United_States) and the country has gained, as you have said ""a net benefit"".

This poses a question, why should we look at ""countries"" as discrete units when analyzing free trade, an inherently globalizing phenomena? Shouldn't we, instead, look at particular groups of people who are advantaged and disadvantaged by a given event?  The ""net benefit"" that has been demonstrated from certain forms of ""free trade"" is in many cases is a massive benefit to those who were already wealthy at the cost of increased labor competition, but little or no wealthy increase increase for those who are poor.  Of course, this doesn't attend to the wealth increase that often results in those countries who receive greater labor demand (which, again, tends to be vastly centralized), but your point was to the net advantage to particular countries, rather than to worldwide well-being.

&gt;6 The rolling blackouts in California during the 90s were not due to 'deregulation', but due to price controls placed on the retail price of electricity.

Not true.  The price controls were part of the deregulation process.  You can claim that it was this part of deregulation which caused the rolling blackouts, rather than the massive sale of currently installed capacity, but that would be a different argument.  This is not hair splitting, the hidden implication in your statement is that deregulation would not have caused rolling blackouts were there no price controls in the package.  However, since deregulation was not merely a massive sale with no further regulatory oversight, we have only speculation on what necessarily would have resulted in this hypothetical deregulation scheme.  This is similar to those who claim that the post-soviet reforms were not the cause of the [huge economic collapse](http://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/entry/History_of_post-Soviet_Russia#Economic_depression_and_social_decay) that Russia incurred after they were put in place, because those reforms did not go far enough.  This may be true, or it may not, but given the history of the reforms as they actually occurred, it doesn't count as evidence one way or another.

&gt;There are some [in my opinion, weak] arguments against them

For the moment, lets set aside the violation of church and state that results from taxpayer vouchers being paid to private religious schools that instruct children with religious indoctrination.  So, vouchers are introduced in a city with money taken from the general school system.  As a result, any child can pick which school they attend and competition flourishes (to a limited degree, of course, as most children are heavily restricted to which schools they can attend by simple geography).  Thus, students whose parents can afford to send them to expensive private schools now receive a direct government subsidy to do so (a subsidy by taxpayers in general for the wealthy in particular).  This naturally pulls more children out of public schools, so those schools get less funding.  However, parents who cannot afford to send their children to expensive private schools and parents whose children have special needs not met by private schools that selectively choose their students must now pick between schools which are least expensive.  This means, in economic terms (i.e. all things being equal), that poor parents will send their children to the schools which perform the worst, whether those schools be public or private.  

Thus, an already tiered education system becomes massively more tiered, as the wealthy and upper-middle class get a bonus to the amount of money directed toward the education of their children, which is taken from the general fund that previously went to all children who attended public schools.  The rich stay in the good schools (which actually become better, unless the rich blow the money they are saved by the subsidy on a nicer Lexus) and the poor stay in the bad schools, which have lost much of the money they once had and thus will likely get worse.

So when you say the ""children"" benefit from vouchers, I think you may want to point out that a specific subset of children benefit, at a direct cost to another subset.  Perhaps you think competition alone can make up for taking money currently allocated to the poor and giving it to the rich, but I'd have to see that argument detailed to address it.  Especially given that the poor and lower-middle class in the US make up a much higher percentage of the population than the rich and upper-middle class, the end result of your proposal seems to be to increase education spending for a few at the cost of the many.",1303342470,"especially given that the poor and lower-middle class in the us make up a much higher percentage of the population than the rich and upper-middle class, the end result of your proposal seems to be to increase education spending for a few at the cost of the many.","rich and upper","rich",NA,FALSE,"rich and upper","upper",NA,NA,1

Yawn. This was not my point.

Hmmm. I'm not sure what you're trying to say there habibi. ""Unlike other rich Arab countries""? Well, if you want to single out a whole population and say that they are lazy, I can do the same.

I can't see an evolutionary or selective advantage to jealousy.

Certainly nobody goes around today thinking to themselves, gee, that guy is really cute, and totally rich, but I just wish he were a little more jealous, maybe I'll hold out.

I guess if your position is that jealousy led to violent behavior, and we killed the competing suitors, that might advantage the DNA of the violent one, except...

Pre-agricultural coherent hunter-gatherer socieities were generally limited to a small number, say 150 people, which closely correlates to Dunbar's number (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar's_number).  As everyone in these hunter-gatherer tribes depends on the others to help diversify the risk of an unsuccessful hunt, to raise children in the case of untimely death of an adult, and to survive versus preditors with far superior physical prowess than homosapiens, what would happen to the one member who jealously guarded the meat he found on the hunt?  He would be ostricized by the rest of the group when he inevitably did fall on bad luck, and would starve.  

Beyond which.  Human women don't announce ovulation.  Our poor jealous forfathers, petrified that the women they own might spread their legs during a fertile period for someone else, would have to spend the entire month at home defending her from suitors.  This would significantly reduce the time he could spend finding his subsistence, wouldn't you say?

Here's the truth - the 'red wine for red meat' line is only a guide, at best.  This is true for big, strong, tannic reds (tannins are the stuff that make your mouth pucker a little, and are what make old wines taste so good).  Actually, I can't be arsed writing out a bunch of paragraphs.  Here's something useful: 

BIG WINES

Most Australian shiraz and cabernet, most decent French wine over 5 years old, some Spanish temperanillos, most Californian zinfandels.  Yummy with BIG MEALS: steak, beef bourguignon, roast lamb, etc.  Big wines for big flavours.

Quieter reds: younger French wines, pinot noirs, younger malbecs and mouvedres, merlots.  Yummy with rich but subtle food - aromatic bolognese, arrabiata sauce, bbq, paella, etc.

Spicy whites: many Aussie viogniers, a sharp riesling, a crisp gewurtztraminer.  Yummy with sharp, edgey food - Thai green curry, most other coconutty, creamy, spicy curries.

Buttery whites: oaked chadonnays, older gewurtztraminers.  Yummy with round, warm, buttery food - carbonara, roast chicken with lemon and thyme, anything with cream and mushrooms.

Fruity whites: I'm looking at you, sauvignon blanc.  Yummy on its own, but with food I'd go for seafood and citrus.

Wine is too delicious to be cast off as some plaything of the rich folk.  It's very easy to find really delicious stuff for not much at all, and the right wine with a meal can knock the whole thing out of the park.

"c13cezy","&gt; The truth is that we're not very good at being happy or content

The truth is that pleasure is the absence of suffering. Our will to power is a will to stop personal suffering, including boredom, the suffering of individuals bonded by affection, the lack of a present set of individuals to bond to and interact with and be respected by, the unfulfillment of basic biological needs (such as sleep, food, and sex), lack of pleasant climate (or a sufficient substitute in the form of clothing and shelter), lack of personal space, or lack of means to evolve one's virtues (skills). The reason why ""we're not very good at being happy or content"" is because we're prevented from ending this suffering. We're coerced into not ending this suffering. We're unfree.

To say that we surely must have evolved that way just shows an inability to see the current state of human existence as just one possible state of many, or the attempt to justify the own sad state by defining it as natural. There's no control group of planets.

Think of a socialization of homo sapiens² living all their lives in an artificial ecosphere, never having been able to communicate with the or otherwise been outside all their lives. The vegitation is lush and there's plenty of food, the area is too huge to explore but still not monotonous, the fauna is serene. What would they hoard?

&gt; The existence of the very materially wealthy among us can easily obscure just how fortunate and rich most of us are.

We are rich, but we are not fortunate. The contemporary flawed mindset, that tries to satisfy one's unfulfilled needs by senseless hoarding or consumption, will of course never stop, for it is unable to grasp that the attempt to end e.g. loneliness by hoarding or consumption is futile to begin with.

Of course, the perpetual acquisition of material wealth can deliver you from coercion and maybe coerce others into your community, but that comes at the price of, as said, coercing others.

Also, once you realize why there's pressure on the much-too-many to sell their effort and themselves below value, you'll realize not only why this coercion is rationalized as necessary, but also why it would be unnecessary to begin with.

"c113buk","When I first saw this concept earlier it seemed a little half-baked to me. This cross-section makes things a little clearer. It seems this is a single-module design where the whole unit is intended to be deployed in one launch. That makes sense in terms of the technology at-hand for Russia. But it seems a bit disingenuous to refer to this as a 'hotel'. I can't imagine it being particularly pleasant for 7 people, even relying on the additional space provided by the Soyuz vehicles -which are really where half of the accommodations are. What this does make perfect sense for is a MOL (manned orbital laboratory) or IMOL (intermittently manned orbital laboratory) for research applications.

I've long been of the opinion that the notion of space tourism has much less value than is commonly -compulsively- attributed to it in the New Space community and that the more practical focus should be on modest facilities for the reduced-cost orbital industrial research the space agencies dropped the ball on with their own man-in-space obsessions. 

I envision the situation like that of a beach resort location. Imagine one of these typical long beaches, like in Miami, where you have all these hotels lined up like dominos along this great strip of sand. They all have their identical piece of the beach, they all have the same window views, they are all bringing in tourists for the same attraction. How does this sustain so many hotels when the basic attraction is the same? How do the market forces not result in a consolidation into one to a few giant hotels owning the whole beach? The key is that they implement a sliding economic scale of accommodations coupled to variations in aesthetic from cheap to expensive. And this parallels a sliding scale of economy in transportation options to the location; trains, busses, cars, planes, private jets and yachts. So this diversity of hotels is supported by the potential diversity of accommodations and experience that can be applied on top of the same basic attraction. 

Well, there's no such diversity in space when the basic cost to get there is most of the cost and only accessible to one narrow demographic. There won't be much variation in transportation because, once the hardware starts flying, whatever proves the most cost effective probably wins by default and becomes ubiquitous since, despite the high cost, the profit margin is tiny and largely dependent on transportation overhead. So 10 space hotels are basically all the same hotel with the same attraction; pretending you're a heroic First Space Race astronaut in a high-tech version of 'roughing it' in an orbital can wearing adult diapers for several days, floating around in microgravity, drinking champagne out of a squeeze bottle, and gawking at the Earth out of portholes. How do you cultivate much of any variation in this experience? What is the difference between an 'economy' and a 'luxury' space hotel if they both cost a million dollars to get to and both have to be designed to absolute functionalist criteria? I think this problem limits the space tourism concept to just a few possible players and, in general, we're looking at a market that, even at millions of dollars per visitor, is a fraction of the scale of the market for Coca Cola. 

Considering this, I've been of the opinion that what space development needs isn't orbital hotels for the rich but rather economical orbital industrial lab facilities -IMOLs and UOLs (unmanned orbital laboratories)- accessible to entrepreneurs seeking to develop mass produced products for the general public on Earth. It's not the multinational dinosaurs whose knuckleheaded notion of innovation is buying up the small companies that invent new stuff. It's universities and the midnight engineers. That should have been the primary purpose of the ISS, but it wasn't because the ISS only existed to justify the continued existence of the Shuttle, not do anything truly useful. Really, despite the huge price tags that awe us peasants, everything done in space so far is penny-ante compared to everyday industry. It costs as much to build a large cruise ship as to develop a new unmanned launch system and we make half dozen to two dozen big cruise ships every year even in the midst of this global recession. 

Most here have probably heard that old factoid that the whole cost of the Apollo program was less than what American women spend on cosmetics in a year. And that's not just a commentary on our idiotic cultural priorities, it's also a demonstration of the relative scale of serious industries to what we do in space right now. If there were products based on space production that mattered (things like an advanced CPU or memory device, advanced optical fiber, breakthrough drug, etc.), more money than has ever been spent on all space programs combined would miraculously be at-hand -because that's the level 'real' industry is at. But few are really looking for those products in a concerted way because the dinosaurs don't innovate, real innovators don't have the space access, and tourism may not do all that much to help with that. This is where national space programs matter in very practical terms of creating industries, jobs, and a public ROI in GNP. But they just don't get it. And New Space doesn't either because, frankly, they're all rich guys with Tahiti Syndrome on personal adventures.

When I hear about space hotels I yawn because, in a long term space development context, they probably don't matter much. But if Bigalow or the Russians were making a leased space IMOL at $20k a cubic meter with unlimited bandwidth VPN connection, that's something that would impress me. That could change things. Energia, if memory serves, had some years ago this neat and unique commercial offering. They had this modest little pressurized capsule that they would sell lab space on that would be launched to LEO on a modest launch system and just hang around for a month. So you would have your disposable micro-labs on this and just collect their data by telecom link as they ran experiments on orbit and then they it would burn up on reentry. That might sound a little wasteful and the concept suffered from its short flight duration and limited space, but this was one of the cheapest means of accessing space for research ever offered -and almost no one in the west took any notice of it. (and in the east, there just weren't that many tech entrepreneurs yet -the Berlin wall had only recently come down) I bet few in this reddit ever heard of it. This is the sort of stuff New Space should be focusing on, in my opinion. Commercially practical things you can do with modest LEO launch capability. You want sustainable industry, this is it. Maybe palling around with midnight engineers isn't as cool as palling around with celebrities and zillionaires, but if you're going to be the first to make a billion in new space industry, this is where it's more likely to come from. I don't think space tourism will ever be an industry on the scale of even game software.

I think you made a mistake here, as you contradict yourself. Who's tax burden is proportionally greater/higher?

The military disproportionately employs the poor and working class. So in this sense, they are receiving a ""fair share"" of the pay (as they earn their pay), however the rich are paying what I would not call a fair share of the expenses. Owners and executives of military suppliers are receiving an unfair share of taxes, however.

&gt; On the other hand, that proportionately small tax ""investment"" by the rich protects their means of wealth production or even opening up new markets to them.

Now this I'm confused by. In theory, our military should be used to defend the nation, and can and has been used to protect trade routes. But the military operations in Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Iraq are not defensive, and are not protecting us from harm. The violence and disorder they cause don't open markets. There is a small handful of people and companies that benefit (what Eisenhower referred to as the military-industrial complex), but in general, war causes rich and poor to suffer.

&gt; Perhaps a better analogy for ""fair share"" would be hail damage insurance: Shouldn't the rich and poor all pay the same for roof insurance? That's not particularly fair if the rich have twice the square footage (and maybe twice the number of roofs to protect) as the poor

No, of course they should not. They should pay for the coverage they use, which will be proportional to the size and value of the house. The rich will obviously pay for more, but not because they are rich, but because they live in larger homes. This goes back to what most people, I suspect, will consider ""fair"" when splitting the dinner bill: each person pays for what they ordered.

**We are the Super Rich**

*Posted by Todd Henderson on September 15, 2010*

The rhetoric in Washington about taxes is about millionaires and the super rich, but the relevant dividing line between millionaires and the middle class is pegged at family income of $250,000. (I’m not a math professor, but last time I checked $250,000 is less than $1 million.) That makes me super rich and subject to a big tax hike if the president has his way.

I’m the president’s neighbor in Chicago, but we’ve never met. I wish we could, because I would introduce him to my family and our lifestyle, one he believes is capable of financing the vast expansion of government he is planning. A quick look at our family budget, which I will happily share with the White House, will show him that like many Americans, we are just getting by despite seeming to be rich. We aren’t.

I, like the president before me, am a law professor at the University of Chicago Law School, and my wife, like the first lady before her, works at the University of Chicago Hospitals, where she is a doctor who treats children with cancer. Our combined income exceeds the $250,000 threshold for the super rich (but not by that much), and the president plans on raising my taxes. After all, we can afford it, and the world we are now living in has that familiar Marxian tone of those who need take and those who can afford it pay. The problem is, we can’t afford it. Here is why.

The biggest expense for us is financing government. Last year, my wife and I paid nearly $100,000 in federal and state taxes, not even including sales and other taxes. This amount is so high because we can’t afford fancy accountants and lawyers to help us evade taxes and we are penalized by the tax code because we choose to be married and we both work outside the home. (If my wife and I divorced or were never married, the government would write us a check for tens of thousands of dollars. Talk about perverse incentives.)

Our next biggest expense, like most people, is our mortgage. Homes near our work in Chicago aren’t cheap and we do not have friends who were willing to help us finance the deal. We chose to invest in the University community and renovate and old property, but we did so at an inopportune time.

We pay about $15,000 in property taxes, about half of which goes to fund public education in Chicago. Since we care the education of our three children, this means we also have to pay to send them to private school. My wife has school loans of nearly $250,000 and I do too, although becoming a lawyer is significantly cheaper. We try to invest in our retirement by putting some money in the stock market, something that these days sounds like a patriotic act. Our account isn’t worth much, and is worth a lot less than it used to be.

Like most working Americans, insurance, doctors’ bills, utilities, two cars, daycare, groceries, gasoline, cell phones, and cable TV (no movie channels) round out our monthly expenses. We also have someone who cuts our grass, cleans our house, and watches our new baby so we can both work outside the home. At the end of all this, we have less than a few hundred dollars per month of discretionary income. We occasionally eat out but with a baby sitter, these nights take a toll on our budget. Life in America is wonderful, but expensive.

If our taxes rise significantly, as they seem likely to, we can cut back on some things. The (legal) immigrant from Mexico who owns the lawn service we employ will suffer, as will the (legal) immigrant from Poland who cleans our house a few times a month. We can cancel our cell phones and some cable channels, as well as take our daughter from her art class at the community art center, but these are only a few hundred dollars per month in total. But more importantly, what is the theory under which collecting this money in taxes and deciding in Washington how to spend it is superior to our decisions? Ask the entrepreneurs we employ and the new arrivals they employ in turn whether they prefer to work for us or get a government handout.

If these cuts don’t work, we will sell our house – into an already spiraling market of declining asset values – and our cars, assuming someone will buy them. The irony here, of course, is that the government is working to save both of these industries despite the impact that increasing taxes will have.

The problem with the president’s plan is that the super rich don’t pay taxes – they hide in the Cayman Islands or use fancy investment vehicles to shelter their income. We aren’t rich enough to afford this – I use Turbo Tax. But we are rich enough to be hurt by the president’s plan. The next time the president comes home to Chicago, he has a standing invitation to come to my house (two blocks from his) and judge for himself whether the Hendersons are as rich as he thinks.

&gt;Unless you increase your luxury items, you never have to worry about money again for the rest of your life.

I'm sorry but this simply isn't true.  I think you have an odd idea about how much money 500k a year is.   To ""never work again"" someone making 500k would have to save every penny for multiple years even if they wanted to scale back to a much lower lifestyle.    


&gt;You're already driving a nice car, living in a nice home, all your needs are met and exceeded, you can afford nice vacations, you can afford second and third homes...

I think you are living in dreamland if you think people in the 500k bracket are the ones with multiple homes.   500k really doesn't go as far as you seem to think if you are actually living within your means.   Now again, after 20 years of making 500k with responsible living you will have saved enough to become wealth, but it's certainly not a given.

&gt;More importantly, I have a lot of knowledge about how the upper class lives, as I am from it.

Oh yeah, how much money did you make last year?  Or do you mean your parents?

&gt;the rich are living in a bubble in which they don't consider themselves rich.

All I'm pointing out is that if you have to get up and go to work every day to maintain your lifestyle... you aren't rich.   That's the definition right there.   Most of the people at the 500k bracket COULD get rich, but most don't and if they left their jobs or got laid off would be in deep shit.  Wealthy people have enough assets that they don't need work, ever.

&gt;The fact that you can sit here and argue that the rich aren't rich because all of their awesome rich-person shit is really expensive...it's just ridiculous.

Rich = people with a lot of money.   The argument here is over how much money.  You defined rich as being less than wealthy.  I'm just pointing out that a wealthy persons life doesn't look the same as a ""rich"" persons life using your own definition of rich as NOT being wealthy but just below.   Soaking the people that make 500k and actually work vs tapping the billions in assets that never get taxed seems silly to me.    There is a fundamental difference between someone who NEEDS to get up and go to work every day vs someone who doesn't.  That's the dividing line of wealthy to me.

Bottom line, taxing INCOME is fucktarded and should be illegal.
Taxing WEALTH on the other hand makes a ton of sense.

* 4 oz (1/2 c., or 1 stick) salted butter, room temp
* 4 oz vegetable shortening, room temp
* 4 oz cream cheese, almost room temp
* 1/2 tsp vanilla
* 1/4 tsp butter flavor (Wilton brand, available at some walmarts, joann fabrics, michaels, cake supplies)
* 48 oz powdered sugar, 10x, sifted
* 2 tbsp whipping cream

Combine the butter, cream cheese and vegetable shortening in a mixer bowl, and beat on med speed till light and fluffy, about 5 mins in a kitchenaid, maybe slightly higher speed and a little more time with a hand mixer.  

Once the mixture is fluffy looking, and much lighter in color, pale yellow, lower speed and add vanilla and butter flavor, mix to just combine.  

Now turn off the mixer and add the powdered sugar, I add it to the mixer along with 1-2 tbsp cream and cover the bowl all around with a damp towel, to prevent the ""poof"" cloud of sugar it will send out once you turn on the mixer.  Mix on low til just combined.  (I decorate cakes professionally, and overmixing at this point will cause air bubbles in the icing, which will not allow the buttercream to have a nice smooth finish).  If its too thick, add a little more cream at a time till you have your desired consistency.

* If you are going to add food coloring, add it with the flavorings.  

* If you don't mind the air bubbles, overmix to your hearts content, and add colors at the end.

But really, tax cuts are irrelevant.  What counts isn't what's collected, but what's spent, and who ends up with it.  My point is that when money - whether financed by taxes or by borrowing (the idea being that we'll still take it from the rich, but later on) - is targeted for 'the poor', it's 'the rich' who end up with it.  And that's why the gap keeps increasing.

"c0sbrj2","Learn to recognize those thoughts and learn the counter-arguments to them.  Are you on medication?  My anti-depressants *really* helped me do this.  I just mentioned to someone in another thread that pre-medication, all those nasty voices felt very self-enveloping - I felt trapped inside of them - and I didn't even realize that wasn't normal!  After a few weeks of medication (and if you try this, talk to your doctor about expectations, effects *can* take months, not weeks, to show), I started to realize that unconsciously, I was starting to fight back against those voices, and see them not as a part of me, but as something against me.

I'm not saying I don't still end up in a downswing from time to time.  Right now I'm out of a job, I'm almost out of money, and it's insanely hard to keep myself up.  I'm failing sometimes.  But I'm doing way way way way wayyy better than I'd have responded before, and the strength helps.

Some of the arguments and counter-arguments:

- I'm ugly.
- No, you're normal.  Stop looking at magazines and TV and start looking at the world.  That guy over there has some pretty crooked teeth, but he's got really nice eyes.  That girl over there is overweight, but man, is she ever gorgeous every time she smiles.

- I'm worthless.
- Nobody is worthless.  I'm not a professional, but I'm good enough at art that it makes my mother very happy just to see me finish something - and it gives me a feeling of accomplishment as well.  I'm incredibly good at making people laugh, and every time I do that, I've sent someone on their way happier than before they met me.  I help my mother with my grandparents, who are both sick, I help around the house, I have donated both time and money to charity, and I have these friends/family who love me.  Pretty sure that = worth something.

- I'll never amount to anything.
- What the heck is 'anything'?  What a vague term.  I may not ever be famous, but how many people are, and when I really look at some of them and the lives they lead, would I ever change places with them?  I may not ever be rich, but how many people are?  There's more to life than money, and I've got some of it.  I'm not happy with where I am right now, it's true, but I've done some very good work in the past, and as soon as I pick up a job again, I'm going to start saving for school and finally do that thing I always wanted to do, but which my own depression kept me from doing for so many years.  I may be in my 30s but I'll be damned if I give up on myself now, or in my 40s, 50s, 60s... basically, check in with me again when I'm dead, and we'll see how I'm feeling then.

- I don't deserve happiness.

you need a double boiler, or you can use 2 pans, one smaller sitting in the other on top of a couple of spoons.

you need a whisk or something that the hollandaise can flow through while you stir it to make sure a layer of lemony scrambled eggs is not forming on the pot bottom.

i like mine very rich and unhealthy.  i don't make it very often but it gets inhaled when i do.

i use a proportion of 3 egg yolks to a 1/4 lb stick of butter, juice of 1/2 lemon, a pinch of salt, a pinch of cayenne (i taste it and adjust.)  

bring bottom pan of water to a simmer; separate eggs and cut up butter into top pan, add lemon, salt, cayenne, and nest in bottom pan.  stir continuously with a whisk or whatever, taking care not to let things congeal on the sides/bottom.  the water should never come to a rolling boil or you will have the scrambled egg problem; you want a smooth emulsion.  do not stop stirring - your arm can keep moving for 6 minutes, i promise.  when it is thickened sufficiently (i like mine rich but still thin enough to pour - maybe the consistency of a smoothie) take the top pan off the water and keep stirring for a bit to make sure it doesn't clump up or curdle.  

our family classics are 1) to use it for a dipping sauce for artichoke leaves, and 2) eggs benedict, the food of the gods.  recent fave is hollandaise over a poached farm egg over steamed asparagus.  but you can just eat it cold smeared on a cracker and it's still delicious.

I know of more than a couple high-profile murder cases where the defendant gets off. We all know that if Paris Hilton had been a regular person violating those laws she would have done real jail time. And she wouldn't have been allowed to get out of jail early! Got out of jail early, are you for real? There's no comparison the quality of lawyers that rich people get.

Another aspect is penalties. If you can't pay the fine, you go to jail. It's a ""get out of jail for a modest sum"" game to the rich, and hard time for the poor. This has a massive cascade effect. Going to jail for 6 months will almost often lead to losing a job, certainly to loss of pay, possibly loss of apartment, possibly loss of spouse and family. If you could just pay the fine, YAY, you are there to keep your job and make the effort to keep your family together.

But wait, there's more! Bail! Bail seems explicitly designed to favor the rich.

But wait, there's more! Political connections! You are rich? You might be one of the 10% of Americans who funds the lion's share of all political races, and, because of your generous donation, gotten to know the elected official who appointed your Judge, the elected official who is the boss of the cops, and/or the elected official who you will later seek a pardon from.

But wait, there's more! What about your privacy? If you want coke-fueled orgies on your private estate, the cops aren't going to hear from the street. If you want to snort coke all night in your Yale dorm room, I'm sure you are free from random police surveillance. In fact, you can probably smoke pot on the Harvard campus without fear of the police. The rich have space where they can commit crimes. The poor are packed together, and have far less privacy, and the cops know they can't bust the rich fucks snorting coke at Yale, but they can bust they poor fucks smoking crack in the slums of New Haven, CT, so they go after them. The rich have tons of protection from being approached by the cops in the first place, gated communities, private institutions, et cetera.

But wait, there are some more tiny bits. Sociolinguistics. People who are rich speak differently, and this _usually_ has an affect on people who hear them. They sound better, they are more often believed. 

But wait, there's more! Have you heard about the situation here in NYC? To maintain quotas, cops are patting down and harassing people, mostly poor black males, for absolutely no reason. You think they'd have been getting away with this for so many years if they did it to rich people? Of course not, there would be complaints, complaints powerful people would have to listen to.

...

You think things are basically fine. I do not.

I think the drug war is a sham, and that incarcerates 100s of thousands of people annually, but not, among them, Barack Obama, George Bush, Al Gore, all who used a lot of drugs.

It's OK, though. I think it is a matter of sensitivity. First off, I know there are alternatives. Watching B&amp;W movies from the 30s, 40s and 50s shows me that there was a day when cops treated people, by default, with a certain amount of respect (at least, that was how they were portrayed). You can watch a lot of these old movies and never see anyone forced to lie spread-eagled, face-down in the street. Never.

I'm also just an empathetic person. I feel other people's pain.

And I think it is important. I think that if America is going abroad and murdering people, we are evil, and that evil makes us all uneasy, and that leads to bad things. I think a well functioning justice system works the same way. Each time we make a mistake, our national conscience takes a hit. 

The justice system gives a pass to those with money, and beats down on those without.

When he was initially arrested for his current crime, the police seized $1.5 million in marijuana and paraphernalia from him.

Now, I don't know how much he sold his seeds for, but I have never seen seeds below $5 a seed, they also go as high as $20+. So even at the low end, he has done $20m in business, and at $10 a seed for an average, $40m in business. I know this isn't all profit, and a good chunk will have gone back into the business. 

But over the 16yrs he has been doing it, it is at least $1m in business a year.

Then there is the Cannabis Culture magazine, which also probably brings in a decent amount of profit, it had sales of about 100,000 a year, at around $5 an issue. Also, not entirely profit.

One of the basic tenets of a healthy society is a large middle class. As the poles of rich and poor get further apart, the middle class shrinks.

[Majid] Ezzati’s finding is unsettling on its face, but scholars find further cause for concern in the pattern of health disparities. Poor health is not distributed evenly across the population, but concentrated among the disadvantaged.
Disparities in health tend to fall along income lines everywhere: the poor generally get sicker and die sooner than the rich. But in the United States, the gap between the rich and the poor is far wider than in most other developed democracies, and it is getting wider. That is true both before and after taxes: the United States also does less than most other rich democracies to redistribute income from the rich to the poor.

"c0nttth","&gt;If someone said the things I linked about Chinese people, women, gay people, or another group, it would be considered quite hateful and intolerant. You say it about men, and it's not even recognized as being an attack on men.

Not to be a nag, but those sorts of comparisons tend to veer on the edge of bigotry themselves because it makes such groups appear privileged when they most definitely aren't. If you say something like that about those groups there will usually be an *argument* as to whether or not its bigoted, with all the usual talk about 'I didn't intend this' or 'my gay black best friend says that' etc. etc.

Oppression is a strong word that is apt for discussions of what those groups have to face. But men, particularly white men, it's extremely difficult to argue that they face oppression *because they are white men*. People who are male but also happen to be people of colour, disabled, LGBT, immigrants, working poor, and so on can claim to be oppressed. Sociologically speaking their manhood can intersect with those oppressions to produce a particularly noxious type of oppression (i.e. what black men in particular experience).

But to say, full stop, 'men' are an oppressed class is marginalising to the very concept of oppression and for you to say that arguing such is misandrist seems to come from a parodied understanding of liberation politics (i.e. well those other people get to call whatever they want racism/sexism, so I can call whatever I don't like misandry). It doesn't actually work that way. I don't throw around terms like misogynist and transphobe *lightly.*

&gt;Do men also suffer from negative gender stereotyping and enforced gender roles? Yes. How is that audacious?

It's not that men suffering from gender roles is audacious, it's conceiving it to be on a par with women (who were once restricted from voting and considered property, and who are still treated rather differently and as a 'second sex' to the male's default) is problematic. You're probably going to argue with me and say that none of that's true. But therein is the qualitative difference between the gendered social localities of women and men.

By the way, quite frankly a lot of people (many MRAs among them) *do* assert that the groups you listed are not oppressed. Do you know how much racism I've seen on this website? To say nothing of its transphobia (transgender people are actually accused of *creating* a marginalised class because it's evidently such a bonus to be oppressed).

Many men in this world suffer, but if they are oppressed by anything it's a culture that is cackhandedly attempting to promote a type of masculinity as its ideal.

&gt;Actually since their problems do stem from a patriarchy, they are not oppressed. Oppression occurs between groups, not within. Men (as a group) cannot oppress themselves (as a group). While men do have social problems, they are not oppressed.

This is not misandrist.

It acknowledges men's problems and argues their source lies in the engine of our gendered culture.

Secondly,

&gt;So why do you conclude patriarchy (rule of men) and not rule of the rich and powerful?

I notice that white men are very fond of old-guard socialism in this respect. The simple reason is that this is the type of oppression 'everyone can agree on' since it does not cast their status group as part of an oppressive culture. Rather it's the rich and the upper middle class (who we can simply pretend are not predominantly white or male and who we can pretend are not possessed of certain ideas about culture and gender that cant towards patriarchal ones). Or perhaps religion, a favourite of white male ""rationalist"" Atheists (ignoring the fact that the Catholic Church is the very definition of patriarchal, and that Islam does not have the best record on women's rights).

But when people of certain experiences speak along axes informed by their experience- whether it's as a person of colour, an LGBT person, as a woman, whatever, then suddenly there is discomfort.

These facts, however, exist simultaneously. That there is economic oppression, and that there are other types of oppressions. Capitalism is an economic force that oppresses the non rich, but could anyone argue- for example- that the forces of Jim Crow in the US didn't specifically target one group of people in all that time? And that its impact still ripples into the present day?

Does anyone really believe that some cosmic equilibrium of oppressiveness exists because of capitalism?

Put another way: heterosexual married couples can have enormous problems. Spousal abuse, failed marriages and dysfunction, poverty, on and on and on. Does this mean, however, that relative to gay people, they do not have privilege? Or that heterosexual people are oppressed *because they are heterosexual*? That there is some cosmic equality between the heterosexual experience and the queer one because bad things happen to het people?

No, not really.

But let's return to your favourite oppression (the one that, on its face, is gender and race neutral). The rich, one can easily argue, do not lead charmed lives. The social milieux they inhabit are very stifling. ""Society"" (in the upper class sense of the term) can be very unforgiving of scandal or impropriety. You cannot be yourself if you wish to protect your family's reputation and standing in that glittering constellation of privilege.

Many rich people suffer from psychological disorders, have a high rate of suicide or drug use, and find that their families become shambolic and shattered after a while. All because the upper class lifestyle stifles and isolates them. Indeed, statistics will show the wealthy commit suicide at a much higher rate than poor people of colour!

Does this obviate the existence of class privilege? Does this mean now that rich people are oppressed? Do we have a poor-archy because of this?

No reasonable person would argue this.

Conceiving of oppression as meaning ""the dominant group lives in paradise and has perfect lives where nothing bad ever happens and unicorns serve them umbrella drinks"" is, of course, going to allow one to poke holes in the idea. But the vast majority of reasonable people- including most critical theorists- do not argue this. Only people who are ignoring real oppression do.

With men controlling much of the world's wealth, most corporations, most governments, and most of the seats in almost every representative democratic body, or nearly all of the bureaus that govern in dictatorships, it is very hard to imagine that 'oppression' is the right word to discuss the discretely male experience. Men who experience poverty are oppressed. Men who are gay are oppressed. Men who are black are oppressed. But is ""man"" as a status group in and of itself an oppressed class? No.

You might now argue ""I didn't vote for my MP/congressperson! He's not *mine*!"" Or somesuch. Otherwise arguing that male CEOs and such do not represent you, etc.

I'm reminded of an old film that gave me a good deal of pause a couple of years ago that was showing a meeting (more like a confrontation) between black activists and white liberals in the late 1960s. The black liberationist argued with his counterpart about ""your mayor"" and ""your newspapers"" and ""your government"" and so on, the liberal man demurring and denying they were in any sense 'his.'

At first I agreed with him but as I reflected on the confrontational discussion, the back and forth between those two people, I realised it was impossible for him to say that with a straight face. In a society where race was that important, you couldn't disown, say, the New York Times' whiteness. Or that of the government. They were so racially divided for a reason. You couldn't blame a person of colour for feeling like they *weren't* represented in these places, that such things were not *for* them except perhaps by vague implication.

Where a media or government would treat this white liberal man as the default in-group, the black activist would always be the outsider, the curiosity, the ""interest group"" (note how that word is used in politics to discuss all non white, non male political organisations).

So the liberal man *couldn't* truly disown those institutions, those organisations. Because he could not escape the fact that even if an editorial was written that he disagreed with, its author would look like him. Even if he didn't vote for the president, governor, or mayor odds were good he'd look like him.

This has *begun* to change. But because that change has begun does not mean this fight is anywhere near over.

You cannot disown the male supermajority in the halls of power. If wealth alone determined power, such places would be split 50/50. But the racial and gendered makeup of our powerful institutions alone puts the lie to any idea of discrete male oppression.

You are correct in asserting that ""patriarchy"" is not comprised of the set of all men. Women are very often its agents, both in how they police other women and how they police men. Yet men also police other men, often quite violently.

Patriarchy, in its popular definition, does mean ""rule by men."" As I've established above that is true. Most of our rulers, worldwide, are men. Female heads of state remain a novelty, as do female CEOs (and, much of the time, when one rises to the top she is usually white, cis, and upper class, highlighting the *other* oppressive axes in our society). However, to say that alone is patriarchy's definition is untrue. It describes less a type of government or structure of rule than it does a societal atmosphere that governs our normative system of gender.

It is not only a top-down system, but very much a bottom-up one in which many women eagerly (and sometimes unwillingly) participate.

So you'll get no denial from me there. But patriarchy it is because it is, ultimately, in service of a particular male ideal that is conceptualised as superior to all expressions of femininity.",1270852422,"secondly,  &gt;so why do you conclude patriarchy (rule of men) and not rule of the rich and powerful?","rich and powerful","rich",NA,FALSE,"rich and powerful","powerful",NA,NA,1

The implication being that the welfare and regulatory state makes a place rich and prosperous. Nothing could be further from the truth. You're making a simple causality error. To see why, imagine a city where everyone is extremely poor. Now impose welfare state programs. You will make them worse off. Every welfare state program requires a tax to fund it. Much of the money will be wasted via bureaucracy - the people as a group will get back much less than what they put in - and will be even poorer because of it.   

The people in this hypothetical impoverished town live in shacks. You impose some the regulatory state measures, let's say building codes. The result isn't a city full of nice houses. With you forcing them to spend what little money they have to remake their shacks to government specifications, they end up worse off, or, if they can't bring their house up to the government-imposed housing code, they end up homeless.

The same result would occur if the city was filthy rich. The welfare state and regulations would make the rich city poorer than it otherwise would be. Being poorer is not a benefit to anyone.

"c0mduku","When you have true freedom, the power to choose what you do and when, it can become a problem. Most people spend many of their waking hours, either pursuing goals which are externally directed (working for others either via career or family). They also spend much time working towards future goals. Your wealth has stripped many of these goals from your life.

This places the existential dilemma front and center. It makes the paradox of choice evident in everything you do. Basically, everything you do is of your own volition and, due to your freedoms of time and money, you have a vastly wider set of things to choose from. On the surface, these seem like excellent things. However they have downsides.

When many actions are chosen for you by work, religion, or other social obligation, they are simple. You do them, and are rewarded for doing them well, and there is no problem. Now that you are self-directed you must choose your own actions and find your own ways of ascribing worth and meaning to them. You must face the fact that freedom of choice comes with responsibility. 

If you consider certain things valuable, or meaningful, and your actions do not reflect these values, you have no one to blame but yourself. Most people use a lack of money or time to rationalize their failures to act on things which are important to them. You have no excuses anymore. Your recent depression seems to be a wake up call. It is clear that you have recognized a need to do meaningful things, and that is an important first step.

The paradox of choice also comes into play at all levels for you. For most people, having no choice is demoralizing and depressing. Having a few choices is empowering and leads to greater satisfaction (whether they succeed or fail). Having very many choices leads to regret when a poor choice is made, and also leads to lowered satisfaction even when a good choice is made. Curiously it also causes people to make fewer choices at all. They choose nothing from a whole category when the options grow too daunting yet would choose to do something if there were fewer choices available.

I am facing a similar problem in my own life. I am far from rich, but just wealthy enough to have a great deal of freedom. I could return to school, choose any career I wanted without worrying about pay, or be unemployed for a few decades and devote my time to something I was passionate about. I find that the bar for measuring success has become much higher for me. The sheer number of choices has often led me to do fewer things. I look back on recent years, and find that to most objective eyes I have been very successful. Yet like you, I do not see great meaning or value from my recent actions and blame myself for my choices.

I don't have much practical advice to give you beyond a few things which I have recently adopted.

* Adopt a zen approach to mundane aspects of life. Savor the joy from little things. Don't let your expectations sway you too much.
* Try to find ways to be directly helpful to others rather than just via money. Face to face help - tutoring, hospice or hospital care, volunteer work, or sitting on a local charitable board.
* Find things to be grateful for each day - large or small.
* Learn more about the field of Positive Psychology - and Dr. Martin Seligman's work

Good luck to you. I hope you find satisfying ways to help people and work towards goals you find meaningful.

How do you measure it? I like the HDI as it incorporates measures beyond the monetary wealth of the nation and tries to incorporate some other aspects of life in the country. There are many states which outperform the USA in this measure which have programs that try to provide equality of opportunity to their citizens.

&gt;How do you propose achieving such a society? You have admitted that social programs often (if not always) fall short of accomplishing this.

It is a bit of a conundrum because sometimes almost identical programs in two different countries have very different effects. I must say that one thing I have noticed is there there seems to be less 'abuse' of welfare systems in nations with low income inequality, and in nations with high income inequality there is a higher degree of welfare abuse. I haven't done any research or even read any research on the topic, but my intuition would be that a good way to get to the sort of society I mentioned is to put in place systems which sort out income inequality first.

I don't think so.

Sure the individuals themselves may have not experienced the fruit of their labor as much as their children did, but that is a choice they made themselves and I don't believe they would regret it one bit today. It is almost always the greatest aim of a parent to give their children a better life than they themselves had and I believe that is the reason the US had the greatest increase in wealth and standard of living in the span of the 19th century.

Back a few hundred years ago, only a small percentage of whites in the south were rich enough to own slaves.  This lowered the costs of production and it also rendered other farmers destitute because they were unable to compete with the much bigger plantations.  The politicians tried to rally the poor against the rich, but the poor flat out refused to, even knowing this economic injustice would ruin them.  The reason why they supported the rich and wealthy is because they too, hope to be rich enough to own slaves one day too.

Conservatives are not rich in general, but they are willing to support the ideals that made others fabulously rich no matter how exploitive it was, because they want that window of opportunity to be opened for them as well.

When Abraham Lincoln was made president, the South was able to rally up all the white men and women by telling those who had an economic interest that their only opportunity of being rich has been closed off, and those who did not have an economic interest, that the slaves would take over, kill their masters out of revenge, and forever change the white way of life.

"c0kfvla","I use Grid for unit frames and Clique to actually cast my heals.  If you're not comfortable with using modified clicking (shift+right click, crtl+alt+middle click, etc), then there's nothing wrong with skipping Clique and just healing normally by selecting a target and pressing the appropriate hotkey.  I healed that way for years.  However, I do recommend Grid (or something else that's as feature-rich but visually simple).  One of the myriad things you can set up with Grid is an aggro indicator.  Any time anyone in my group/raid has aggro from any mob we're in combat with, a red dot appears in the upper left corner of his or her frame, so I immediately know who to shield and, depending on the severity of the situation, follow up with another heal.  That would cover one of your questions.

You most likely won't need anything to tell you what heal to use in a given situation.  Priests have a LOT of spells, but only a few heals that are regularly useful in combat situations: shield to prevent damage (esp as Disc), Renew for light damage and to smooth out tank health, Flash Heal for most general purpose things, and Prayer of Healing if everyone in the group just took lots of damage.  Depending on your spec, you get another heal that just does the job of one of the others I've mentioned but better, and you'll get a feel for how to use them when you get there.  Basically, every spell has a job, and they're all different, so there's not much sense of which one's right but not too much as a priest.  Except GHeal, but screw GHeal.  Never (*ever*) cast it as Disc, and rarely cast it as Holy.

Spec-wise, I'd recommend Holy until sometime between late-40s and 60.  Disc starts off really slow, and all the juicy talents that make the spec fun are very deep in the tree.

&gt; To circle back to your point about not having to cover the burden of repairs. You should assume that the landlord is building into the cost of rent an expected failure rate. You are getting charged that regardless of things breaking or not. Further when they calculate repairs they are guessing, so there is some extra always built in.

That is his problem, not mine.  And I also know there are repair costs factored into the rent.  I get worried if the rent seems too low.  I have been renting a long time (almost 15 years now). I have had good landlords and stupid landlords.

&gt; A home is a way of forcing people to put away money.

Not when if have:

a) have a bad interest rate on the loan and 

b) not if you cannot get every dime of interest back via a tax refund.  At best, you are getting 1/3rd of your interest back.  The govt will not give you money you did not pay in as taxes.  People are sold a bill of goods when they buy a house thinking deducting interest = getting all interest money back.  That is not how it works.

"c0i96r4","Definitions 1, 3 and 4 do not apply. The question was not, 'Does the word 'shallow' have a definition?' The question was, 'How would you define **someone** who is shallow?' 1, 3 and 4 are irrelevant here because one cannot say that a person lacks physical depth, is marked by insufficient inhalation of air, or is closer to home plate; these only apply to things, not people. For someone who casually throws around the word retard, you certainly set yourself up for that one.

The only definition here that is relevant is 2: lacking depth or intellect, emotion, or knowledge. The rest is useless padding. Let's go with your definition, though. I accept that (in this second, dictionary post, which is **not** your first definition); someone who feels no range of emotion when their sibling dies, for instance, is arguably shallow.

Nevertheless, I think - in your first post - you flatly denied a common use of the word, the one that most of us would think of when we think of shallow. For instsance, a gold-digger - someone who pursues a lover solely because of their money. I think most of us would understand, and agree, that they are being shallow if all they care about is money, but *that doesn't make them shallow,* according to your definition, because it's what they want. Even if they qualified that by saying, 'I want other things too - he has to be rich, but also smart, and handsome, and loving, and with a great sense of humor...' adding more conditions doesn't really make it better. She's shallow for excluding everyone who's not rich at step one, just as (to make this gender-equal) you sound shallow for automatically excluding everyone who's not a hot chick. Even unself-consciously using the word 'hot chick' sets off the douchebag alarm, to be honest. 

You even seem to grant my point when you say ""I like hot chicks, **but only** if they have a good personality,"" etc. - arguably, you don't need to have any reasons beyond that, because it's just 'giving into your desire to what you want,' if we go by your logic. In fact, by your logic, it's enough to say, 'I like her because she's got great tits' - it's not shallow because you're giving into your desire for what you want. This is what I mean when I say that if that's not shallow, nothing is - because *it doesn't matter* if you lack depth of intellect, emotion or knowledge if you can excuse it by saying 'I'm not shallow, I'm just giving in to my desire to what I want.' Being still more selective after that initial bout of shallowness doesn't really make it better.

"c0hjn0f","Frugality is about not wasting resources so you can focus on what's important. It's not just spending less money. If all you're focused on is not spending money, then that's being cheap -- unless you're in a (hopefully short-term) financial emergency. Unless I'm missing something, you're not. So, as a frugal person who is doing well financially, you should keep in mind your other resources that you shouldn't waste, such as time, health, and friendships -- as well as what other priorities you should have besides accumulating more money.   

I have no problem with you clipping some coupons here and there if you enjoy it and wouldn't be doing anything else more enjoyable with that time. I know for some clipping coupons while watching t.v. or listening to music is actually relaxing. But if you don't enjoy it and would rather be doing something else then it is a waste of your time. And if you're clipping a lot of coupons for food, you may need to look at your diet and ask yourself if you're eating too much processed stuff just to save money.

I also have no problem with you not going out and buying a lot of junk just because you can afford it (i.e. above and beyond ""needs"" and reasonable ""wants""). That's bad for the environment and there are much better uses for money. 

What I find sad, though, is that with your income and assets it seems like you're putting saving $50 before spending time with friends.

I've thought about doing this. Seems fun enough to try. Still haven't gotten around to it because I wasn't feeling in the mood to be cheery. My mood swings depending on momentum.

&gt;read a newspaper or listen to NPR in the morning so you have something to chat about

I find it hard to ask about what people like talking about. If I knew how to navigate a conversation, I'd probably be inclined to start finding out more about what they were interested in.

&gt;exercise

I do, daily. Waking up between 6am and 7:30 to do a morning routine with my bro a few times a week. Nearly daily actually. Weights, outdoor cardio(not so much now that it is December). I still feel bored with life. It doesn't lift me up like making a decent quip or dumb little joke does.

I like being around people when I make them happy. Unfortunately I feel like the downer of the group sometimes so I spend a bit of time away.

Hard for me to make intimate friendships. Haven't really had a friend I considered a close friend since middle school. But the group parted ways, or at least I did during my depressed High School years. I never tried to catch up.

The first reason that I am so nice in person is because I found that in high school I liked to genuinely be nice. It's very disarming. It's hard for people to think of you badly so it covers up most of my depressive moods quite nicely. When I am depressed I just blame it on my tiredness (tiredness is an ongoing problem for me).

By being nice I can cover up that I am generally really an introvert. I'd joke around and people would accept my lame jokes quite easily. Being seen as the shy one of the group has its benefits in that people don't think I am some weird outcast who has no friends. It helps to have a general clique even if I never was invited to the parties. 

I'm just the dude who just happens to be there but no one really knows but others in the group think I know one of the others in the group really well. I just fake it by small talking to other members of the group slightly apart from the others then rejoining the rest of the group conversation when it gets harder to keep up the chatter. Makes it look like I actually know people personally. The stranger lost in a group of friends. Sounds weird but that's how I feel.

I actually go back up to people and try to make small talk or small bit of joking around and I try to keep it as short as possible. I push for a reason to walk away to go back to work or whatever. This is enough to make it seem like I am their friends. I can only do a few sets of tired jokes before it gets old so I try not to waste them too much.

One of the girls from my old group actually said to me, ""we consider you a friend"" jokingly. I responded too honestly and said ""really?"" I couldn't pull off that I was joking and I can see she was taken aback by my genuine response. Fortunately no one was aware of my weird reaction. I've since broken all ties her and that general group.

If I were define my goals, it would only be so far as going to work just so that I don't look like I am dragging my feet and getting paid enough to pay a few bills. Sure I have lofty ideas about being socially awesome and rich, but I don't give them much weight other than being fun little detours from reality.

Back in high school, I was feeling really depressed. While I was reeling from the continual thoughts of suicide (just passively thinking about death and dying really) I came to the conclusion that I'd just live as long as possible to see how the world develops. So far, pretty bland. Now instead of death, I think how bored I am and how much my life sucks. I feel like I am a leech. I am just alive and taking up room just to be alive. I'm not even producing anything useful.

I dropped video games. I never smoked weed or did drugs. I never got into partying or drinking. It's better that way because I don't want those things to blame for my failures. My failures are mines. I don't want to blame inebriation for my actions. I'd rather see the boredom of my life for what it is. I even try not to oversleep.

The problem is that when I fail, those who are close think I failed only because I am bored. They think I am so smart that I get bored of the work and I have no drive. Fucking failing college because I don't really care about writing software to write video games anymore (the reason I went to college).

If I do want anything in life, it is for something to put all my energy into. Some kind of life long passion to just pull all my energy into. I have absolutely no motivation to get up in the morning other than the daily routine of staying awake long enough to get through the day. The week. The month. Finally the year is ending. At least time is moving forward.

"c0cce6a","&gt; So you'd say to withdraw 700,000 security forces and just lose a part of the country to an enemy that forcibly tried to take it? What would you say if Canada took upstate New York 70 years ago and was in a stalemate for it with the United States? Just withdraw all troops and lose the country? Pakistan is a legitimate threat to India.

Only one problem. India got that land in dubious circumstances. They got it in tribal forces invaded Kashmir from Pakistan. The Hindu leader of the muslim state agreed to be part of India. Despite the fact that India already sent a precedent in Hyderabad. They forcibally took over Hyderabad which was ruled by a Muslim leader while the people were Hindus. That is one point.

The other point is that the Kashmiris have demonstrated so much that they hate being made part of India. So much so that they celebrate every time Pakistan wins. The 700,000 security force is also to keep them in check. 

You really shouldn't get Canada and USA involved. The actions of Pakistan and India is something these two countries would never do. For example Canada would never dare or want to take over Upstate NY. Other then the fact that they don't want to they don't have the legal right and the American population would be hostile to them. Most developed countries would never take over a land if they had to use a large military force to keep it in. Nor would they continually ignore abuses their troops commit. India really needs to learn that If it wants Kashmiris to like them. Ignoring rapes and murders committed by their forces isn't a good way to go.

&gt; Pakistan is, by definition, an aggressive country. It's built on the principle that people of different religions cannot exist together. Under formation, they expelled their religious minorities and named their country Land of the Pure. Their name itself shows their view on religion. Their view is that Muslims are pure and others aren't.

Pakistan came into existence because of the threat the large Hindu majority posed to the others. A fear that has been proven right time and time again. All most every other minority in India has faced attacks by Hindu nationalists. Sikhs twice,Muslims several times and Christians often. When the police force,courts and government is Hindu dominated. It's hard to get justice. This has been proven time and time again. Pakistan was built on a separate homeland for Muslims away from Hindu domination. They did NOT expell minorities. It was a mutual inter community violence that Engulfed all parts of modern day India,Pakistan and Bangladesh. To say it was Pakistan only is to lie.


&gt; On the other hand, India is staunchly opposed to this idea. Its founding fathers tried their best to keep Pakistan and its citizens inside India and even offered the position of Prime Minister to the future first Prime Minister of Pakistan in exchange for peace. That would be giving the strongest position in a Democratic country to a segment of the population maybe 20% the electorate.

The man who wanted to make Jinnah PM of India was shot..... by Hindu nationalists. Kind of tells you how the communities feel.

&gt; India has supported this for most of its history, being staunchly anti-Israel and Anti-Apartheid South Africa because of their policies of segregation. India has more democratic elections than Israel and some countries in the European Union.

It doesn't matter how many democratic elections you have. What matters is the quality of your democracy. So far Indians seem to have only two choices. Congress a party that has blood on it's hands and the BJP the Hindu nationalist party that has blood on it's hands. The choices don't look so good.


&gt; This fight in Kashmir isnt only a resource battle. To Indians, its also a fight against the anti-modern forces of Islamic nationalism and a fight to protect the national identity of India as a multi-cultural entity capable of stable growth. India has had leaders of many different Religious groups. Nehru was an atheist, Manmohan Singh is a Sikh. Abdul Kalam is a Muslim. You will never see this in Pakistan. Mostly because they forcibly ejected almost all of their minorities (including my grandfather and his whole family)

Kashmir isn't about Indian ideological. I's one of those more land = bigger dick issues. When the Indians took over the country it had nothing to do with fighting Islamic nationalism. At that time Islamic nationalism didn't exist. The Pakistani forces in the 40s were **culturally** muslim but in all other manners secular. India may have leaders from minorities but the power at the end of the day rest in the hands of the Hindu majority. The majority of voters are Hindu which explains it. 

Btw if your pissed off at your grandfather leaving his home. Join the club. Millions of Pakistanis came from what is India. Some died on the way to Punjab or Sindh while others made it. It's highly idiotic to blame it on Pakistan. It happened on both sides and it wasn't organized by the Indian Congress party or Jinnah. It was inter-ethnic community violence. Your not the only victim of it. I know Sikhs whos grandparents were born in Lahore.

&gt; People in India dont ever go to Kashmir. Kashmir doesnt have any industrial significance for India. But it is the most important part of India for the very reason I said earlier.

It's only important because people have become nationalistic. Give two different people from different countries a land dispute and they will always say the land is theirs. I like to call it the Land = Bigger Dick issue.

&gt; The only reason Kashmir seems to be unstable is the presence of Pakistani-trained, Pakistani-supported terrorists spreading violence and propaganda in the region. If you notice, India-born Muslims are in no way radicalized. They all are just as anti-Pakistan as Indian Hindus are.

Kashmir has separatist rebels. They aren't powerful enough to take on 700k men but they are there. The Pakistan trained forces are terrorists and most Kashmiris disagree with their practices.

&gt; Sure, India has its problems. India has many problems. But those pale in comparison to the threat of losing Kashmir.

That's the white elephant in the room. Kashmir is just something the government can dangle in front of the voters to distract them. Indias real problem which will decide if it will join China has a fully developed superpower or just a third rate poor power with a large economy is the population growth and poverty. I saw some stats a couple of years ago. I'll look it up for you that stated about 100 million+ Indians shit in the open. Now that is a massive public health danger. 
A few acres in disputed scenic landscape is nothing compared to the problems that India has in the area it already rules over without dispute. Why should they care about Kashmiris who hate them when there are millions of people in Mumbai who live in squalor?

"c0c5pkz","Healthcare is something I know quite a bit about. My only real grown up job was 5 years of working with the uninsured, the underinsured, and the fully insured who still got f-ed by their insurance companies. Here's what I know about our system and why we need reform:

1. This idea that the government will kill old people and down syndrome babies is the stupidest thing I have ever heard. The government already provides healthcare for old people and down syndrome babies - we pay for it with Medicare tax and state taxes for Medicaid programs. If Mrs. Palin didn't have insurance for her kid through her employer or her husband's employer, she would be hard pressed to find affordable insurance (I know she's rich, but most people in that situation would find the cost of private insurance prohibitive) that would cover her down syndrome baby (see pre-existing conditions in #3). Fortunately for her, the government provides health insurance for citizens with disabilities in the form of Medicaid - in some states it's not much but it's better than nothing.

2. Everyone who has good insurance through their employer pays for it. It is taken out of your check before you get it, but your company counts it as pay - it is part of your benefit packet. The healthcare reform will not make this change, but if you wanted to go with a government plan, your company would then include this money in your actual paycheck and then you could buy healthcare with it. For those people who are not fortunate enough to have a company help out with healthcare, now they would have an option.

3. Pre-existing conditions would no longer be an issue. Most people have no idea that a pre-existing clause, which is included in most plans, will mean that you will have absolutely no coverage if your insurance company determines that whatever you are being treated for was there before your policy started. So, let's say you start at a new job, you get your insurance plan which looks super dandy and then a month in you start feeling sick. You see your doctor and he determines that you have Multiple Sclerosis or Stage III brain cancer - your insurance company will almost surely determine that these conditions pre-existed your policy (because odds are, they did) and they will not pay for any treatments related to these diseases. A government health plan would look pretty good if you were looking at footing hundreds of thousands of dollars of medical expenses on your own.

4. This idea that private health insurance companies have a patient's best interest at heart is so ridiculous it makes me want to hurt someone. Health insurance is a billion dollar+ industry. They make their money by collecting monthly premiums and denying as many claims as possible. They deny them because a code was off by one number, because a decimal point was missing, because a cheaper treatment could have been used, because a treatment is not covered unless several things are tried first, and for a million other reasons. I have worked on these denied claims - it's insane the percentage that are denied and for the most mundane reasons. If you have a great doctor with a helpful staff, you are lucky because they will help you appeal. But if you have a doctor who wants to be paid for his services in a timely manner (as most do), you are on your own to fight it after you've paid out of pocket. 

I have dealt with so many patients who have suffered or died waiting for their insurance companies to approve a treatment. This is a sample of one of hundreds of conversations I have had with countless insurance companies: 
Me: ""Patient X has terminal pancreatic cancer. The pain has become so severe that there are no longer any pain drugs that will help because he has become tolerant to them all. The doctor would like to prescribe drug X which is more expensive than the other drugs but is the last thing that will relieve the excruciating pain of this patient who is dying of a very painful type of cancer."" 
Insurance company: ""That drug is not covered on this patient's formulary."" or ""This patient's file has been sent for review as a pre-existing condition so we won't be paying any claims until that is resolved."" or ""That's an off-label diagnosis, we don't cover for off label diagnoses."" 
Me: ""Seriously? This patient is terminal and is in unbearable pain. Isn't there anything you can do?"" 
Insurance company: ""No, if he wants the treatment he'll have to pay out of pocket.""
There is no room for sympathy at the insurance companies. I'm sure the people who work there feel terrible about what they have to do, just as I felt like jumping out of a window every time I had to call these patients and tell them that the insurance they pay $400-$1000 a month would't cover a treatment they needed. 

This is all insane to me. The people who are yelling the loudest about no healthcare reform have obviously never been sick and in the position of being denied by their insurance. But it will happen, if not to them, to someone they love. I watched my dad fight with his insurance to the end of his life. He was diagnosed with Stage IV stomach cancer in July 2003. He had what we thought was really good insurance through my mom's work and a secondary plan with the VA. His primary insurance was an HMO with a wide network of doctors and hospitals. He saw one doctor who gave him 6 weeks to live. He asked to see another doctor for a second opinion. The second opinion was down the hall from the first opinion and shockingly agreed with his colleague. Their plan for treatment was for my dad to get his affairs in order and spend time with his family until he died. My dad wanted to fight and chose to go to Sloan Kettering in New York, one of the leading cancer centers in the world, where a friend of a friend worked and thought there may be some experimental treatments that might help. His insurance company had no out of network benefits. We appealed to them to cover, explaining logically that there would be no way to ever get more than one opinion, because no doctor in the HMO would ever contradict another doctor in the HMO. They denied our appeal, but told him he could get a third opinion from another guy down the hall, so my parents flew to New York and paid out of pocket for their visit to the cancer center. The doctors there came up with a regimen of experimental chemotherapy and radiation which the HMO doctors reluctantly followed, all the while explaining that it wouldn't do any good to have false hope. My dad lived almost 2 years after his HMO told him he had 6 weeks. If you want to know what a real ""death panel"" looks like it's two in-network doctors and a claims department telling a 52 year old man that he's lived long enough and should give up before they've even tried to fight for him.

"c08is9m","&gt;This season I have no idea what's happening and can't even recap the episode up to that point.

\*SPOILER ALERT\*
After Ben and Locke telling the ""Oceanic Six"" over and over that they need to get back to the island, they finally do.  The various episodes this season have shown where everyone was during this period of time.

**Recent episodes**:

Sawyer, Juliette, Faraday, Red-head, psychic guy, and Jin have been stuck on the island bouncing back and forth through time due to Ben's inability to turn a wheel correctly.  When Locke stops the time jump, the group is stuck in 1974. They integrate with the old (real) Dharma Initiative.  

Sawyer (calling himself LaFleur) manages to tell Richard (eyeliner, ""leader"" of the Others) that he and his friends were with Locke during the time jump, so Richard knows their special. Horus (leader of Dharma) becomes great friends with Sawyer and even has Juliette deliver his wife's baby, which they name Ethan (dun dun DUN...).  They all live happy until 1977 when... \[flashback\]

The Oceanic Six, through a series of unconnected events, manage to get together once more.  The end up on the same plane that is heading to Guam.  Jack, Kate, Hurley, Sun and Ben get on intentionally while Sayid gets captured by a mercenary and taken on the plane.

  Flashback info:

 * Jack became an alchoholic.  Then he wasn't anymore.
 * Kate became a mother to Aaron.
 * Sun became vindictive over the death of Jin.  She works with the bad guys to get revenge on Ben.
 * Sayid works with Ben to kill a bunch of people.  Then does some humanitarian work, then he gets caught by a mercenary.
 * Hurley is rich, but insane.  Sees dead people (Eko, Charlie, etc).  Goes to asylum.
 * Desmond and Penny have baby, live on boat. Penny MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE been killed by Ben, which he promised to do.
 * Crazy lady (Faraday's mother) is an island expert, tells them all where to go.
 * Locke's life sucks for him.  Business as usual.  He goes to kill himself, but Ben stops him only to kill him.

**1977**:  The plane to Guam, piloted by Lepidus, goes SWOOSH.  Kate, Jack, Hurley and Sayid get dumped in 1977.  Jin finds the first three and manages to bring them in with Sawyer.  They become disguised as new Dharma recruits.  Sexual tensions abound between Kate and Sawyer (business as usual). Sayid, however, gets found by Jin in another part of the island where a Dharma guy sees him.  They can't hide Sayid so they must treat him as an Other.  

Sayid gets befriended by young Ben Linus, who helps him escape after an interrogation session in which Sayid is given drugs and tells the truth (which they Dharma people don't understand).  Sayid shoots young Linus after channeling the minds of millions of viewers worldwide.

**2009 (2008?):** Sun, Lepidus, Ben, and a living Locke (dun dun DUN...) are amongst the survivors of the Guam flight.  Turns out they crashed on the little zoo island.  Sun, lepidus, and Ben go to leave for the big island before Sun knocks Ben the fuck out.  Sun and Lepidus end up at the abandoned Dharma village where Jack's ghost father tells them how Jin is back in 1977.  Signs and portents abound!

**tl;dr:** Half our people are in 1977.  The other half are in the present.  Kate is a whore, Hurley is lovable but cleary insane, Sawyer is one of the most sane people on the island, Jin is confusing some times, Little Ben is creepy as hell, but dead by Sayid's bullet-power.  

Sayid hates himself, Juliette doesn't like Kate because Kate is a bit of a whore.  Jack is no longer a leader figure, having pilled out too much I believe.  Charlie is till dead (well done writers, I wasn't sure you could resist).  Locke is dead but alive now, so that's cool.

**stl;dr:** Lol, island mystery!  Signs and portents abound!  Kate is a schizophrenic whore.

You really don't have to be rich to make it through college, trust me, i did it (less than 12 grand a year completely on my own), high school is free and if you do well you'll get in you just have to figure out how to pay. My parents didn't want me going to college...they wanted me to stay home and take care of them (they are crippled/vegetables) but sometimes you gotta do what you gotta do. The key to the sad thing here is the MOTIVATED part. Coming from the rough side here so many people are unmotivated. So many people just want to take it easy and pop out a few kids to justify their lives (especially the rich white folk, spend some time they are some of the most ignorant and unmotivated people you will ever meet). So when you hear about people crawling to the top of the dog pile, or just starting out after making it over that first huge and seemingly impossible hurdle (and trust me it is a big thing to figure out what you want to do with yourself and by pure will MAKE it happen) and then die to some event that could have been prevented. IT IS MORE TRAGIC. To one set of people (the people who have already done it) it hits so close to home that they were so lucky, or they worry for their own children than might be there and for those who are aspiring to be the young and the motivated it brings an air of unjustified inevitability...bringing fear of a thing before it is even experienced. 

Also, i don't know if you went to college...but most of the kids there aren't rich white fold...they make up about 12% of the entire college populace (i worked crunching numbers for the alumni association as one of my four part time jobs....i also worked at Taco bell for a bit there). Most people are from the east...as in Indian, middle east, china, korea (huge number), armenian, russian, japanese. Over 75% of these students receive some sort of financial aid.
The fact that the televised media is so concerned with young white girls is testament to the media's detachment to the american populace. Most media outlets are going bankrupt due to a lack of public interest. Their articles on these missing girls are indicative of their remaining audience: rich white women who sat down and had babies instead of changing the world. Most people when hearing about children getting hurt, actually have a visceral reaction regardless of race of the child or person. It's part of that whole not being a psychopath/sociapath thing.

"c07m2xs","No, ""be yourself"" is horrible advice that only women and happily married guys give. Everybody else knows that's totally full of shit. 

Girls: Think about that ex-boyfriend you dated for months/years before you found out he was a total loser/douchebag. Would you have dated him if he had ""been himself"" to the point that all his flaws were there to see? I doubt it.

""Be yourself"" might work in a perfect world. But we do not live in one. The assholes and psychopaths out there have invented better selves to show to the world, which puts the rest of us at a disadvantage. Their deception raises the ante for all of us and it traps a lot of good women in deception-based relationships, which in turn makes the rest us lonely and unconfident. The ""be confident"" advice pouring out of this thread is pretty unanimous, but it's also completely fucking worthless. You might as well go around telling poor people, ""Be rich!"" Well no shit. True, there's plenty of ways to try and get rich, but most of them involve being *anything other than your true self.* The whole ""be confident"" thing is deceptive, too. If you're not already confident, you have no choice but to fake it. I'm a fan of positive thinking, but we're looking at a serious catch-22 here. The reason people are poor/unconfident isn't because they are lazy/worthless; it's because the world is set up to be unfair. On purpose. The rich and successful tweak the rules to give their offspring an advantage. This is just the way the world works.

One thing that guys have to contend with is that the rules are there to hold you back, not level the playing field. Cheaters don't get arrested; there are no hard and fast dating rules. So psychopaths and assholes take advantage of that fact and cheat endlessly. How come it always seems like there aren't enough single women around? Well, because there really aren't! A lot of women think they're in an exclusive relationship but are actually girlfriend #2 or #3. My colleague recently told a story about how she was dating this basketball player for awhile before she found out about the wife and kids. Oops. Meanwhile there's a guy out there, playing by the rules, who feels rejected and lonely. He's been told he isn't confident enough (that builds confidence! /sarcasm), or that he doesn't talk to enough women or that he *just isn't being himself!*  Bullshit! He is a victim of fraud (as is are all the girls who are involved with the amoral asshole dating multiple women!) and no advice you can give on this thread will make one lick of difference.

So, to summarize: Guys, in order to pickup women you must sublimate yourself and become the alpha male douchebag that you've grown up hating so fervently. I'm sorry. There is no other way (cue married guys saying, ""I found my geek-girl!"" -- great, now there's one less of them out in the wild. Thanks, asshole!) to be a womanizer.

"c05fupy","The thing is, you already pay for health care, and what you pay for is the most expensive in the world.  

Granted, it is among the best care you can get, but there are many first world countries where health care is paid for through taxes and the care is on the same level.

Now if universal health care can be achieved by the our government or not, I'm not sure.  There are significant opposing forces such as the current health care industry which makes a ton of money and would not be too keen on giving up their cash cow.

But assuming that the government could provide health care for roughly the same price as your health insurance, there's no loss or gain for you.

However, if the root of your concern is about the money and taxation in general, here's how I've reasoned it for myself.  I'd be interested in hearing other opinions as well.  For the sake of my argument, I am going to define ""rich people"" as people's who are successful at aquiring money from others and are motivated to keep it.  To clarify, I certainly bear no ill will to rich people and I wouldn't mind being one someday, it is strictly a philosophical grouping.  ""Poor people"" we can define as pretty much everyone.  My boiled down view is essentially:

The Republican methodology of taxation can be reduced to: We are all citizens who must give similiar amounts of money.  After all, each of us is just a person and we all (arguably) should receive approximately the same set of benefits and services from the government.  Why should one person have to pay significantly more to get the same thing? And, of course, there's really nothing unreasonable about that argument.  

The ultimate problem is the rift between rich and poor people and how it is created.  Basically, rich people become rich by convincing people to give them money, the source of which is ultimately a set of poorer people.  It's considered reasonable that rich people will continue to keep taking money from poorer people, even though eventually their need to give money back via the economy becomes less and less.  At some point, their wants and needs are covered, so they don't need to spend all of the money that they get.  (Though for this reason I am actually perfectly happy with the type of rich people who like to blow all of their money, even though common wisdom looks down on this kind of thinking.)

The problem is exacerbated by the fact that most poor people are just wage slaves (figuratively) to other rich people.  So when rich people are giving their money back via the economy, they are really giving the bulk of that to some other rich person, since the rich owners of the company get significantly higher ratio of the profit compared to the average wage slave.

While even that may not sound entirely unreasonable, over time, this creates a wider and wider gap between rich and poor, since rich people are taking back more and more of their own money each time.  Sure, some rich people will fall to being poor and some poor people can rise up to being rich, but as time goes by and the gaps widen the latter will become less and less likely.

In conclusion, a tax model that taxes the rich at a higher rate is one way to mitigate this senario.  Granted, it is probably not ideal, but I think it is fairer to protect those whose intrests may lie somewhere other than finding money all of the time than the alternative.  It also is instrumental in preserving the posibility of the ""American Dream"" as the gap between rich and poor always needs to be short enough to jump across for those that are determined (or perhaps lucky) enough.

"c04rbcq","Oh god, too many fallacies in there to even address.  Let me guess, you are in college and have a bunch of liberal statist professors that love *The Communist Manifesto*.  I was there too and gave their ideas a shot -- they are flawed beyond belief.

But to your argument:

&gt;The natural ""laws"" of economics dictate that the rich control all wealth,

Wrong, as efiniti so eloquently pointed out.

&gt;This is why the rich would love the Gold standard - over time a fixed exchange rate (or slowly sliding one), affords the poor very little opportunity to move up the social ladder. Borrowing is just too costly, for both sides.

Wait, wait, wait.  You're worrying about the poor being exploited by the rich but you want an unaccountable government entity, composed of wealthy private bankers, to arbitrarily determine how much their money is worth?  That's logical.

&gt;Income taxes (redistribution) and centralized money management have lessened the ability of the rich to take advantage of the poor.

This couldn't be more logically flawed.  Giving the rich and powerful (politicians) the ability to ""legally"" rob everyone else via the income tax and giving the Federal Reserve the stealth ability to steal the populace's purchasing power by debasing the currency, benefits the poor?

&gt;Abandoning the Fed and letting the ""market determine"" interest rates is a recipe for disaster no less in scale than allowing the government to abandon the income tax.

I agree -- it would be a disaster for those that thrive off of robbing honest, hardworking people by using the re-distributive state to buy votes via welfare programs (corporate and otherwise).  But this would be a great success if you want things like personal freedom and the ability to take care of yourself, your family and whoever else may need it.

&gt;If you provide a vehicle for the markets to manipulate our money supply, you provide the market makers an infinite ability to create and destroy wealth.

Replace ""markets"" with government and you'll be on the right track.  Markets don't manipulate anything -- they simply are.

&gt;The Fed has done a horrible job over the past few years, but far better than the markets could have done on their own.

But Rand has to be describing an alternate universe because in this one that isn't true. In this one people are born rich, people like Bush, and get power and more wealth not because of competence but because of a rabid willingness to savage their fellow creatures.

That is where your statement falls apart.  You claim Rand invented a religion of wealth that claimed the wealthy were superior to everyone else.

She didn't.  She espoused a philosophy that said the rich who were able to provide jobs, products and services for others were superior.

In fact, if you really have read the novels Atlas Shrugged and Fountainhead you'd easily refer to [James Taggart](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characters_in_Atlas_Shrugged#James_Taggart)

"c03oazr","A fairly meaningless article with a typically misleading reddit headline (but what else is new).

As ithika points out, middle class is not the same as middle income.  We live in a country of middle class people, with the very rich and the very poor actually having little social visibility.  To the extent that ""class"" is a meaningful distinction at all, it is defined by how you relate to money.

Middle class generally means you work for a living.  Within that of course there are a range of incomes, lifestyles, professions, etc. but it means that based on your income (not your assets) you can not only afford the basics but also a certain amount of luxury.  The rich are those who don't have to work another day in their lives and could still keep up the basic lifestyles; the poor can't make enough to get from day to day.  Many perceive the upper middle class as rich, but most of these folks are one pink slip away from losing it all.  Of course you could divide these folks into different classes according to income or lifestyle, even normalized to a given city as Dillenger suggests, but how do you draw the lines?   Even the division into ""upper"" and ""lower"" middle class is problematic and somewhat arbitrary.

I would say also that middle class has to do with a certain set of expectations of the kind of life you lead -- own a house, 1-3 cars, send your kids to college, etc.  Of course these will also vary based on location and other variables.  Class in the US, to the extent it's a useful distinction, is a complex and nuanced topic which doesn't lend itself to rapid superficial analysis.",1207779913,"many perceive the upper middle class as rich, but most of these folks are one pink slip away from losing it all.","rich, but most","rich","but",TRUE,"rich , but most","most",NA,NA,1

"c03gyn0","&gt;Willpower is powerful but not all powerful. You cannot out will a bullet for example.

Sure you can, just buy a bullet-proof vest, or duck.  

Negative conditions in the world don't disprove the divine any more than antartica disproves Hawaii.  Now you might have someone in Alaska shivering their butt off who didn't believe in Hawaii, since all they can see is ice and snow and see people freezing to death all the time, but that still does not disprove Hawaii or alter the fact that it exists.

It is true that the world can be a really awful place, but it can be a really beautiful one too.  The difference is that if the earth were a ""paradise"" we would all be bored silly because we had nothing to do.

Even if the weather was always nice, everyone always had plenty to eat, people would still die from disease and old age.  So you eliminate those and some people would still be smarter and prettier than others, forever.  That would really suck so you couldn't have those differences either.  So you make everyone look the same, act the same (so no one gets made fun of) and think the same (so everyone is perfectly understood).  Well you still have accidents, so you remove all physical danger.  If you tried to create a ""perfect world"" you would just end up with a bland nothing.

So the existence of bad things does not disprove God.  There are stories of movie stars committing suicide because they are young, beautiful, and rich, but they feel they have nothing to live for.  All of the external good things they had couldn't counterbalance their inner darkness.

You are always entitled to give up -- you have free choice, and can do anything you want.  That can mean destroying yourself (such as an evil villain in a story might destroy you) or looking for new ways to overcome.

Spirituality is a sense, just like vision or hearing.  Does the existence of night disprove the sun?  Yet a blind person might disbelieve in the sun if he couldn't see it or feel the effects on his skin.  That doesn't mean that the sun doesn't exist.

Likewise, a deaf person might disbelieve in music, but music very often is extremely helpful in getting troubled people through dark times.

In the same vein, I remember seeing an HBO special on hookers. One of them was saying that she didn't believe in love. She didn't believe in it because she had never experienced it -- does that mean it didn't exist.

I don't want to intrude on your free will to believe anything you don't want to, or act any way that you don't want to.  But it's so sad to see someone give up hope when there are always new things being discovered and invented -- by people who have hope.

The movie ""Lorenzo's oil"" is about a family that did not give up hope and used their will and energy to overcome mountainous obstacles.  There many similar stories.  

I urge you to go find someone who has the true personal perception of spirituality (not just someone who read about it in a book or believes what someone else told them).  Once you experience it then you know -- there's no other way to find out.

People need things to be happy -- Sunlight for some, love for others, art for others, but spirituality lies at a root level for all of us, and when that is blocked, then we experience tremendous levels of pain.

So I urge you to open up new avenues of thinking and action.  When the laser was discovered, the inventors thought it was neat but couldn't find a use for it -- now it's a vital part of everyday life (in cd players, dvd's, etc)

I just hope that you will persist in acting until you find something that lights up your life -- and when you succeed you can help others who are suffering in your same position.

For me the key was reading ""Autobiography of a Yogi"" by Paramahansa Yogandanda -- it gave me the key to open up new worlds for me, scientific keys to getting to know my mind and experience the divine.  For you something else may work, but I just urge you to keep looking and trying new things.

Every problem has a solution.  When you define the problem you are also defining the solution.

I can't do that and then go home and debug software. I'll write the occasional shell script, I'll muck around with config files... but I can't sit around debugging my OS.

Both of us occasionally when something like this happens and we reboot, all of our desktop configurations are lost. It even pops up a little warning saying it couldn't find the config files. So our theme, mouse cursor, and many other settings get reset to default. Then we reboot again and everything is correct. So both of us have learned we have to reboot twice whenever we reboot.

I appriciate your responses, but a lot of things there is just nothing you can do about... the lack of decent software choices in many categories being one. VBox sucks, it crashes whenever the memory usage gets high, and has trouble interfacing with USB drives... ktorrent is the most feature-rich torrent app but also crashes and locks up. It's just badly designed, there is nothing to be done about that. Azareus is just as feature-rich but worse... and for some reason gets far slower downloads. 

The lack of any decent usenet client is a killer. My roomate wants to learn flash... so might be forced to go to windows at some point. Not much you can do about those things either.

"c02jq8k","The biggest clue to the intellectual dishonesty in your posts is your wild exaggeration of any claim you disagree with, in an attempt to make it look silly.  Sorry, maybe that kind of thing works at your high school, but it does not in an environment with scrutiny.

I did not make the claim that Google's conduct is a ""shining presence"".  Conducting business, in the manner that Google does, is roughly morally neutral.  Just merely conducting business is not an immoral thing.  Google has the (moral) right to do business in any country, including China.

If Google is doing business and some thug comes along and says ""Do this evil thing or we will throw you in prison"", Google is not committing, as you say it, a ""misdeed"".  Paying taxes and following the laws of a sovereign country is not a misdeed if the alternative is going to jail.  As anyone with fair reason would see it, a company has the moral right to do business in China; and so if they comply with the demands of a bullying government, they are at worst morally neutral.  You can make the argument that it would be morally positive to withdraw in protest -- but it is not obvious that this is a better solution for anyone.  That you think withdrawing from the country is better than staying and protesting directly is **your opinion** and nothing more.  There is no moral reason why Google, operating in a place where it may morally operate, should be morally forced to withdraw if bullied by the Chinese government.

The fact that Google is on a mission to sell text ads is irrelevant.  It is a for-profit company, and like every company in the world, its goal is profit.  Google does not claim to bring democracy to backwards countries -- but it does claim to operate morally, and both by intuitive reasoning and the things Google has explicitly said when making the decision, continuing to operate in China has merit.

Your whole argument depends upon your assumption that doing business in a place, paying taxes, or doing what one is so ordered by a court, is supporting the government.  It is not.  Those actions are neutral with respect to the government.  Support is a positive thing which Google does not offer China -- it does only what it is compelled to.

Is it your belief that all of the millions of companies in China are ""supporting the government""?  I assure you they are not in support of the government.  It is that they have no choice but to comply.

If you recommend Google shut down business in China, you may as well be recommending every company in China shut down business, because there is no credible reason to single Google out from any other.  Your position effectively leads to the conclusion that every company in China should shut down in protest.  That is not reasonable.

You act as though companies wishing to continue operations are acting the part of the rich and greedy, but in reality the rich greedy person is you, in assuming that all of these companies and their employees are so privileged as to have the choice of voluntarily ceasing to work.  

It may be your **personal opinion** that Google is in some different category because it is so rich, but the unfairness of your opinions is readily apparent when one tries to lay down the dividing line between which ones should and should not cease operations out of protest -- there is no fair way to do this, and so it cannot morally be done.

Is it that you think all of Google's employees in China are so rich they don't need to work?  Shutting down Google.cn is similar in impact to shutting down any local Chinese company: you are hurting people and putting them out of work, people who have no part in the high-horse ivory tower moral arguments you are making.

Whatever policy you advocate should apply equally to all companies in China, because anything else would be unfair and arbitrary.  Your position suggests every company in China should shut down operations and move abroad, else be morally blamed with supporting the corrupt government, which is clearly unreasonable.

If you are going to try to defend your incorrigible position, please explain why if Google should be morally obligated to shut down operations, any other company in that country, that is only incrementally poorer, should not.  For every company on this list, keep in mind the majority of employees are Chinese citizens who are not rich enough not to work, support their government as little or less than US citizens, and are just trying to support their families.  Suddenly when you drop the angelic halo surrounding Google that must be present in your mind, you see that they are the same as any other company: struggling to get along.

For that matter, the US is an oppressive corrupt government, which engages in illegal wars and has killed over a million Iraqis.  By your logic, every company in the US should shut down too in protest.  If only everyone in this world lived in the shiny white tower that you do, with infinite money to support their family, privileged enough not to work, this would be possible.  

The rest of us, including most employees of Google.cn and many other Chinese companies, are not so privileged as to be able to give up work out of protest.

I'll tell you what ""rationalization"" is.  Rationalization is claiming you act out of concern for ""human rights"" but, your policies would just put people out of jobs without doing anything to improve the overall situation.

"c2yhz6","I don't think money precludes creativity at all.

That is entirely different from my point, that money and creativity seem to be pretty unrelated.  Van Gogh was an extremely poor artist when he was alive, but his paintings are the most expensive in existence today.

"c14b9p","I have trained dogs and it is a mistake to interpret their body language in human terms.  People need to live around dogs to understand their body language which is rich but different from ours.  

For example, if a dog puts their weight on you it is ALWAYS is an expression of dominance.  If they put their head on you it is also an expression of dominance.  If you do either or both to them they interpret it as your expression of dominance over them.  You better be right.  This is one reason why hospital dogs are tested for their jobs (or should be).  

If you look at pictures of dogs being hugged by humans and know how to interpret their reaction it shows clearly that dogs would rather you did not hug them.  This site has a couple of good pictures of a typical dog reaction to hugging and general close contact:http://www.familypaws.com/communication/

Dogs are surgeons with their jaws.  They move faster than you can move your hand (ask me now I know), and can decide in that split-split second exactly how far they want to penetrate your skin.  If they only hurt you and did not puncture its not because you got lucky - it was because the dog made a choice.  

Now look at that dog laying on the baby and licking her lips and realize that she could snap that neck in a second.  Does it look cute?  Didn't think so.

When it comes near time to vote, I'll get off my lazy ass and examine his voting record, the bills he has sponsored, etc, but in the meantime, I cannot help wondering how, if he really has any integrity, he managed to get into the senate in the first place. 

Frankly, I don't have much hope for america under any scenario... the choice between democracy and empire was made before I was born, and all of the power is held by the people who are part of the problem. Yeah, sure, Bush was especially bad, and it's good to be getting rid of him, but even the alternatives from the other side of the aisle are nothing but more corporate sockpuppets, with a thin and sparkly coat of ""liberal"" carefully brushed on. 

I can understand why the choice of hegemony was made. It probably didn't seem like a bad choice. It didn't erode our freedom too much, at first. It certainly made us rich. But we're getting less and less free, and the people it's making rich are getting to be a smaller and smaller number of richer and richer people. It's no longer a good deal to live where you can buy cheap consumer goods, if your job is getting exported to India, your best friend just got shot in Iraq, and you can go to prison for years just for having sex with a teenager, downloading a movie, smoking a joint, carrying a handgun, or suggesting that our worthless scumbag president might be better off dead.

We're getting less rich and less free all the time, because our country is gradually being transformed into a massive labour camp designed to squeeze every last dime out of us and give as little in return as they can get away with. And the government belongs, purchased, paid for, and owned, by the people doing the squeezing. 

So they point cameras at every intersection, monitor every internet transaction they can, fine you for not wearing your seatbelt, fine you for not carrying car insurance, make you get a license to sell alcohol, make you register your guns, whatever. And they tell you it's okay, it's just to stop {crack dealers/drunk drivers/child molesters/terrorists/the boogyman}. And everybody complies. Hell, they're even slick enough to get most of the poor saps to clamour for more chains. 

But the real enemy is the people passing the laws, and the people who own them. And there's no big, shadowy conspiracy. There doesn't need to be. Nobody has to get together in a smoke-filled room and *agree* to ass-rape the middle class. They've just got all this money, and what are they going to do to make more? Well, shit, buy yourself some laws. 

Hell, what would you do? 

At this point, I just hope america lasts long enough for my lifetime, before the widening gap between the super-rich and the people who have to work for a living, before deficit spending that would put a drunken sailor to shame, before an environment where 'company policy' carries the same force as law, sends this country spiraling down into third world status. 

So you'll have to excuse me if I don't crow with enthusiasm over the choice of being fucked in the ass with the red dildo or the blue one. Nobody's going to repeal the DMCA, reign in the police, balance the budget, reinstate the gold standard, revoke corporate personhood, legalize drugs, make public education voluntary instead of mandatory, stop sending nuclear bazookas to the psycho axe-murderers that run Israel, or repeal the income tax. What'll happen instead is a wide variety of exciting, widely-hailed, and above all, *hopeful* new arrangements of deck chairs on the Titanic.

"cl99z","Article about economy and not a single number.

And the concept they're discussing (""socialism"") is vague to the point of being meaningless. Like - poor in Western Europe are much better off than poor in USA, and Western Europe is easily more socialist than USA.

Or the other way - the poor in Soviet Union were totally screwed, and it very socialist.

Anyway, some real numbers:

* [Income inequality](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_income_inequality) - a decent measure of ""socialism"", social equality is typical in countries with strong social programs by the government, strong unions, highly progressive taxes etc.
* [Infant mortality rate](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_infant_mortality_rate_%282005%29) - a decent measure of how well the poor are doing, you get high infant mortality only if many people are without adequate access to health care.

These rankings are very close to each other (well, you could run some real statistical test if you're bored) - the more socialistic a country, the better off the poorest people. It's shocking that poor people in poor but very equal country like Czech Republic (infant mortality 3.93, inequality 25.4, gnp/capita $12,152) are way better off than in very rich but very inequal country like USA (infant mortality 6.50, inequality 46.6, gnp/capita $42,000).",1160198469,"it's shocking that poor people in poor but very equal country like czech republic (infant mortality 3.93, inequality 25.4, gnp/capita $12,152) are way better off than in very rich but very inequal country like usa (infant mortality 6.50, inequality 46.6, gnp/capita $42,000).","rich but very","rich","but",FALSE,"rich but very inequal","inequal",NA,"very",1
"c82ra","Of course, being in the lowest 20% income is a *vastly* better proposition in Scandinavia than it is in the US. 

It's sort of interesting to compare. Let's say that the income is normally distributed in both Scandinavia and the US, and let's further say that the average income is the same for both, but that the variance in the US is much larger than in Scandinavia. Ie., on average Scandinavians and Americans are equally rich, but in the US the rich are much richer, and the poor much poorer. (I'm making this up, don't bother arguing whether it's true or not - that's not the point).

Assuming a usual utility function where relative utility decreases with the amount of money, the total utility would be much bigger in Scandinavia than in the US, poor people would be really unhappy and rich people not that much happier.

So, if overall happiness is a goal, it is desirable to actually *trade average income for lower variance*, which is what Paul Graham calls socialism. Ie., you can have higher happiness in a country even if the average income is lower.

Of course the other side is, if the prospect of becoming really rich really is what motivates entrepreneurs, then the Scandinavian model will discourage entrepreneurs, which in turn will cause less economic growth, leading to decreased  utility, leading to less happiness. There is in fact another function, the *likelyhood of being entrepeneur* function that increases with the proportion of people who are rich.

Taken to extremes, the high-variance model would recommend making the huge, rich US middleclass *poor*, since their money could be better spent making entrepreneurs rich. Over time this would increase more economic growth.

If the two functions, *utility* and *entrepreneur*, could be formalized, it might be possible to actually figure out exactly what bell curve variance would lead to optimal happyness over time.",1150510884,"assuming a usual utility function where relative utility decreases with the amount of money, the total utility would be much bigger in scandinavia than in the us, poor people would be really unhappy and rich people not that much happier.","unhappy and rich","rich",NA,FALSE,"really unhappy and rich","unhappy",NA,"really",0
