She probably always acted this way, but because you seem to be a generous and giving person her whining and bitching sounded like a person in need of help and you responded accordingly. 

If there is one lesson to learn from this, it's never ""give"" things away without clearly ""expressing expectations and making boundaries"". 

The vast majority of people interpret getting something for ""free"" as meaning it is worthless both in terms of cost and effort by the giver. 

As you saw with your ex-friend, they will feel NO obligation to appreciate your gesture. In fact, many will feel a sense of entitlement because they are doing you a favor by accepting what they NEVER asked for. 

The worst of them will treat you like their parent who is obligated to giving them what they want.

You can still be kind and generous, but you need to be clear you are giving whatever because you CHOOSE to do this. You are NOT doing anything, because you feel obligated no matter what the other person thinks or says, and you will cease giving, Etc., the moment it turns into a hassle.

I (F55) have been widowed for 4 years, after married for 28.  Been with my boyfriend (M64) about a year.  Don't know if it's forever but we suit each other well for now.  

We have a lot of fun and for some reason he is crazy about me.  He is also really wealthy.  It's fine when we go out nice or whatever, but I made it clear I'm not interested in the money and my independence is important to me.  It was hard-won to figure out how to take care of myself after I lost my husband, and I'm not giving that up.  He says he likes my independence.  

He's very sweet and generous, but sort of unconsciously entitled.  He's a rich white guy who expects things to go his way and they generally do.  There have been a few times a habit of getting his way has shown up, but as soon as I call him on it he backs down and we don't have any problems, just a fun time.  

I needed  a new car. He offered to help, but I was clear I didn't want help, financial or otherwise.  This is the first time in my life buying a car all by myself and it was important to me to do it on my own. 

As a surprise he bought me a new car.  I think he saw it as a sweet romantic gesture, but here's my take:  I clearly told him I didn't want help.  So either he didn't listen, he listened but didn't believe me, or listened and believed my conviction but thought it didn't matter.  I was furious and refused to accept it.  I explained why, and he apologized, said he didn't mean to be disrespectful, he respects my choices and independence.   He said he understands everything and won't do it again - but would I please take the car?  It's complicated to return a car and it would be easier. 

I have spent my life taking caring of everyone else's feelings!  No!  It's not my job to make it easier for other people, he disregarded my spoken requests, that's not on me to fix.  He dropped it. I don't know if he really understood or could see this was the hill I would die on and didn't want to lose the relationship, but whatever.  I don't know what he did with it, I think donated it, but I didn't ask.  I don't know if he paid cash or payments, but either way he won't miss the money. I got a 2016 Sentra. We don't talk about it, he is very careful about buying me stuff, and we are fine.   

Here's why I'm wondering TA - my friends who know think I'm nuts.  I felt so strongly about this, but even my most woke feminist friends are like, ""Yeah, principles, but a new car!""  Someone gave me a whole thing about how accepting it was somehow getting the patriarchy.  Apparently I might be being petty and righteous, and it was rude?  I felt like if I took it, it sent the message to him that I don't mean what I say, or he can get around it.  But one girlfriend in particular said since he only meant well, I should have accepted it.  

Was I standing by my principles, or TA by being petty and righteous?

"g3aete0","Ok so we have the ranks at the top you have the Aub highest rank in the territory then you have Senior, Medium/Intermediate, Lower Nobles.

With that in mind next you have to understand taxation and income for the territories. Aub supplies mana to the territory, Gibes supply mana to their prefecture, It seems like Gibes can be Senior to Intermediate nobles (and in rare cases Laynobles) depending on size of prefecture. Both receive taxation from those it protects and supplies mana to.

Each Noble receives a budget from taxation even if they contributed to the tax themselves. Like how Myne as a blue robe got a percentage of the large gold she donated to the temple even though it was her money to begin with.

So in order to receive more money than their budget they can become attendants and guards for higher ranked nobles. So an Intermediate Noble will be happy to be an attendant changing clothes, washing the body, serving food of a higher ranked Noble because not only are they paid to do so but they are gaining favor with them incase they need help in the future. Because without that favor they or their families wont be able to work in other areas like Tax Collectors, clerical/scholar work, attendance of higher ranked nobles.

The Concert showed that they have a set budget and Damuel lamenting about the cost of paying for Myne's Blue Robe made him go into debt so much he welcomed Ferdinand's offer of clerical work.

So for nobles they have an expectation of being served by equals or lesser. AKA a Senior Noble can only be served by another Senior or lower ranked noble. An Intermediate noble will be served by other Medium or Lower ranked nobles and a Lesser Noble will only be served by other Lesser nobles or educated commoners (Grey Priests, Wealthy Commoner families who want connections). Those who serve them are considered more respected than those who just take their stipend and don't contribute. Like how Sylvester tried to get Myne's chefs they look for those who serve others and offer to allow them to move up. So Henrik (Damuel's Brother) we don't know what he does for work or even if he does work or just relies on the stipend. But now his brother is attached to the Aub's family he will become more noticeable and perhaps sought after to get an attachment to Rozemyne via family connection. A message passed to Henrik could be passed to Damuel who could then pass it to Rozemyne is a lot faster than having to contact a scholar/cleric at the castle have the message filtered and inspected from all including Aub before it got to Rozemyne.

Back to Damuel he is a Lower Noble that was punished and sent to guard a blue robe from the Temple, someone to look down on. Now he is a Knight that is assigned to the Adopted Daughter of the highest rank Aub Ehrenfest how will that change his income? how will that change the respect he gets? how will his family be treated? Also remembering that Frieda is the concubine to Henrik but also a good friend and business partner of Rozemyne.

If all you have to do is bring someone a cup of tea, some poundcake and help them get dressed for your family to get more money, respect and better jobs for your children/grandchildren or more importantly retain the money, respect and better jobs isn't it an easy decision?

Not only that but the higher ranks such as Senior Nobles do you think they want to be touched or served by commoners? They already think less of them, so much so that they visibly recoiled at the sight of the children from Hasse eating and talking. Had Rozemyne not been the one leading the situation there they would have thrown those children out of their sight being generous but more likely just ordered they be killed away from them for being disgusting in their presence.",1598738124,"had rozemyne not been the one leading the situation there they would have thrown those children out of their sight being generous but more likely just ordered they be killed away from them for being disgusting in their presence.","generous but more","generous","but",FALSE,"generous but more likely","likely",NA,"more",1

"g0eqymz","NTA!!! This story actually triggers me so much because it’s the same dynamic my mom and I have with my extended family and it’s driven me crazy for as long as I’ve been old enough to notice. 

I have 2 large cousins (both 6’2ish and kinda muscular/kinda pudgy) who take however much food they want, with zero regard for how many people it’s meant to serve. Over the years it’s happened at countless family meals that they’ve taken way too much food, which always leaves the COOK, who typically serves themselves last due to finishing touches on dinner, (usually my mom) without enough. She once made a large roast, only to have my cousin jump up to serve himself first, and take more than HALF of the meat meant for 10 people. On this one occasion, my mom actually told him to put some back because we ran out, and he actually had the nerve to look annoyed about it. 

Last year, my husband and I hosted Christmas for the first time as newlyweds and we planned for this. We made a large turkey dinner, and when it came time to eat, we asked everyone to take a seat and we served everyone generous, but IDENTICAL portions (I did give my cousins slightly more mashed potatoes, since potatoes are cheap and filling, and as a good host, I obviously don’t want any of my guests to be hungry after dinner, ridiculous appetites or not.) But the look on my cousins faces, when they saw their (completely normal) portions for meat and stuffing were the same as the portions for us smaller women (my mom, sister and myself) was honestly so comical, and frankly, SO satisfying. 

Cooking a meal for family is an act of love; it’s meant to be enjoyed by everyone, together as a family. And as the cook, you, more than anyone, are excited to enjoy the pay-off of your hard work! Even when nobody directly thanks you or compliments your cooking, if you and your family all enjoy the meal, and have a pleasant family dinner together, that’s usually enough!

"fz4uoqf","I mean, the Palestinians were ejected from their home, and what few stayed have been pushed into tiny bits of land while Israel takes more and more all the time. Israel has cut Palestinians off from the ocean that they live on so they can’t import or export anything. And, they harass Palestinians constantly.

Yea, Palestinians throw rocks and have used bombs, but Israel has the full might of US arms at their disposal. It’s fully armored and equipped soldiers versus poor people with rocks and sticks. But somehow, Israel has convinced the world that they are in constant danger from those poor people. How would you react if you were forced into what is practically an apartheid state after your land was stolen, and any hope of progress, a future, or a normal life is suppressed? And even more, the rest of the world cheers on and supports your abusers? You’d probably become “terrorists” too. That doesn’t absolve Palestine of any crimes they’ve committed, but it’s intellectually dishonest to ignore the position they’ve been put into.

You know, I’m just a white dude from the US. I don’t have a dog in this fight personally. I’ve never lived in Israel or Palestine. I went to Israel once in college on a religious studies research trip, but we were far away from any Palestinian territory. Israel is a beautiful country and the Israeli people were so nice and generous. But one of my best friends growing up is of Palestinian descent and the story of what happened to her father and his family was fucked up. But here we are today, with what I would call human rights abuses, and everyone supports the abuser no matter what.

And none of that is to say that Israel isn’t in danger from outside threats. There is a long history between Jews and Arabs (Muslims) in the Middle East.

"fwrabrf","There's a difference there. Yes, western society is plagued by selfishness. No one will argue with you about that. The solution to that, however, is not going Robin Hood and robbing the graves of rich people.

People aren't being raised generous enough. A lot of parents these days are fairly useless at teaching generosity and parenting effectively and it's been basically established that the education system has failed pretty much everyone at teaching people how to parent. Noticeably the most selfish people of a young age are the children of rich as all hell parents because they have lived their whole lives in an entitlement ivory tower and they've never been TAUGHT generosity by either their parents or schooling. By fixing that disaster area and subsequently getting rid of a few ivory towers here and you would MOTIVATE people to BE more generous, rather than MANDATING the same end result of people being more generous but with no actual generosity involved.

See, when anyone rolls up and demands something of someone regardless of what cause it is for, the immediate response is either ""fuck off cunt"" because no one appreciates anyone making demands of them, or a reluctant ""ok sure whatever you say Mr Highwayman"" out of fear. It sets of the same deep seated self preservation response we've had for billions of years and will always have. Kicking in the self preservation response only makes the situation worse because ever since we were reptiles a few billion years ago, that response was only ever triggered by being presented with a really not preferable situation. People consequently get more selfish out of resentment to the ultimatum you have presented to them and charity goes down the toilet. You cannot honestly expect any different outcome because that's just how brains work. Appeals to sympathy and generally raising people to be more compassionate and generous is always going to be far more fruitful than gunpoint robbery. When you mandate generosity it only motivates people to avoid it altogether and then hey presto we have even worse tax evasion and the cycle repeats and everything recursively spirals into an actual full on poverty hell, rather than just a quite shit situation like it is right now.

If you want to make your difference then raise your children better than everyone else, rather than teaching them that people are entitled to this and that and that it's acceptable to demand this and that from specific others.

Warning of more rambling nonsense that might or might not be relatable.

The ""grow to be comfortable with not being me"" part is something which, now I think about it, took me a long, long time to accept. It started, well, decades ago, back when I was still a teenager, after I realized I had to keep my ""imaginary friend(s)"" secret. That thread of ""dealing with myself"" sort of silently permeated my life as an undercurrent I never even realized was there. Probably the hardest part of the entire experience so far has been realizing that Kira is nothing like me and that's a good thing. It feels so odd when Kira takes over and just acts differently, from how she speaks to how she carries our body to what she thinks and does. So many things I don't like or can't get excited about, she's all over the moon about, and she has so many interests. It's amazing to be honest.

Earlier in life, the only way to deal with her presence was to black out but that was an overall terrible experience. It didn't only happen drunk. It also happened in daily life and I wouldn't know what had happened. Just sort of suddenly be somewhere and it would feel so strange. Long before I knew about DID I learned to notice the ""beginning of the funny feeling"" (i.e. switching) and get away from anyone who might notice; this did not always work so I started to hide away. Later on, I'd wake up to messages and posts I could have sworn couldn't come from me. My mid-20s are full of memories of weird moments like that and I had no conception of what was happening. I thought my life was coming undone and I was going insane. No explanation made any sense. I just became ""so weird"" and different for no reason.

Towards late 20s I began to warm up to the explanation of DID but it was still so hard. I had an aversion since early childhood in that regard, since people really notice I'm not me (it's hard to not notice; we're polar opposites with a few shared interests). Add to that the feminine behavior, which I for the longest time repressed out of fear, since I got teased for that a lot as a kid. I had no clue why any of this was an issue for me and didn't make the immediate connection to DID even after I suspected. I never really remembered ""being different"". I just knew I ""got weird"" and that was a bad thing. I never told anyone of course because I was so afraid. It really stressed me out for a long while and the fact I'd get ""stupid"" or ""hurtful"". This would happen with or without alcohol, with seemingly no rules as to when it would occur, and that eroded a lot of my sense of identity. I'm not like that! Why do I suddenly act like that? 

Sometime late last year, I slowly began to accept that this is simply how I am, how we are, and this year after a stupid internal spat it really clicked. There's something raw and beautiful about seeing Kira be herself; she feels very comfortable in our body, which was a complete shock to me. She suffered from dysphoria for years, crippling at times, and I thought that was it: she'd always resent this life. I knew she liked me, even back in the days she was a horrible monster to me, but I thought that was always abstract; an excuse to cling to. Later, when I learned about DID, I saw her role as that of persecutor turned disgruntled protector, and figured it was that. Only after did it dawn on me that she's actually embraced this existence to the fullest and I'm way behind her on that curve. She saw what life is like and decided she wanted more of that, in every way, for all of us, and was going to drag me along, kicking and screaming, until I finally understood what she'd seen years ago.

Kira's emotions in particular are utterly overwhelming rushes of genuine ""her"" that are well beyond me. Everything goes all over like a bouncy ball; she's so natural when allowed to be, with everything that makes her unique spilling out with everything she does. The first few times I really saw her for who she was confused me. I had only seen glimpses in the past, most of them bad or worrying. It took me so much courage to stand up to her when things got really bad. I thought I would have to do that for the rest of my life and, man, that idea really drained me. Kira isn't someone you can stand up to continually; she's way too strong and can argue endlessly and never run out of steam or excuses. She's never wrong unless she's wrong to prove how much wronger you are. Hopeless, I thought. Then I caught a fragment of someone telling her how special she is; some random dude at a bar, the last time we went out about two years ago. No reason for him to say that. He pointed out he wasn't gay or bi but felt he had to say that anyways. That really made me stop and think.

Some random guy can actually see Kira for what she is and is impressed enough to tell her that, in front of a bunch of other people. Then I realized: I'm really missing out. I have to stop messing up who she is and let her be her. Anything else would be cruel and I was too hard on her in the past. No one ever accepted her. Ever. Everyone always had something to criticize and I was no different. I had to figure out how to break that cycle and at first I failed. Utterly screwed up what I thought I was doing and drove us to the brink of falling apart. I really did not understand. But she forgave me and somehow poked and prodded until I finally caught on.

This year, for the first time, I actually saw all of her and it's utterly alien to me in such a strange, unnerving, and wonderful way. Shortly after that, Sarah came out of her shell and is now all but inseparable from Kira. She hasn't fronted yet but they're such a hopeless pair; two different strains of pure emotion and stupidity wrapped up in what I can only call adorable. Thinking about how silly they get makes me smile. 

I used to think Sarah was the genuine and heartfelt one, shy but generous. But she isn't; she's got a tiny heart with barely any space for anyone in it, while Kira goes out of her way to make people she thinks deserve it welcome, even though she's the most prejudiced person I know. No wonder so many people put up with her ""nonsense""; she can be a mess but also such a great person. She's just really genuine and says what she means and never apologizes for who she is. She's also so kind and caring when she wants to be and never runs out of things to say. Sure, she can be horrible, downright cruel, but she isn't usually. Most of the time she just wants the people she cares about to be happy. She never runs out of energy, ever, no matter how bad things get or how hopeless everything seems. I didn't want to see that for so long. I was fixated on the negatives. I was really shackled by that fear of ""not being me"". Turns out I actually really like ""not being me"". It's such a relief because the main ""other me"" is actually a great person. Maybe not all the time but that's okay. We're not perfect and I've sort of given up trying to be that. I prefer us how we are. I think if we were perfect we'd be boring and lifeless. One perfectionist in the system is enough.

It's good to have alternatives and I don't want to hold us back. I'd be doing this system and the woman who held it together against all odds, through all the darkest times of our lives, a disservice if I did. She deserves better and I want to be better. Not perfect; just better.

I'm not sure what the take-away here is. I guess that it's a really long and bumpy process and I totally understand why people find it hard. I had so much trouble with it myself and I'm still not as far along as I want to be. I also guess, especially when I think back to where I started out years ago, when I found out about DID, it all seemed so impossible. Denial and doubt and fear and confusion and nothing made sense. I could see the explanations, rationally, but I couldn't feel ""right"" with this whole mess. I had no idea what do to and, more recently, I found out Kira didn't either; she kept pushing for something, anything, and trial and error until we figured one another out. I never realized how afraid she was to lose me, or that we'd fail and slide back to the way things used to be, or any of it. She just inspired so much confidence that eventually I figured ""yeah, if anyone can figure it out, it's her, no matter how weird she is"". I guess way back when I expected a roadmap. Or to make progress in therapy towards a goal that would be measurable. What actually happened is we went all over the place and made all sorts of mistakes until we sort of stumbled onto a better solution and we're still working on that. I suspect this is the case for most things of this sort. I'm not sure. It's definitely not what I expected in any ways but it might give a bit of hope: even if you don't have it figured out, and even if everything goes sideways, there's always some way forward. You'll no doubt go a different path, in different circumstances, and that is a good thing! 

I can't believe I'm saying that and actually meaning it. I'm such a technical person: do this and then that. But it's true. There's no one size fits all solution and any way one goes is worth it, if only to figure out ""yeah, okay, that didn't work - let's try something else instead"".",1593710402,"i used to think sarah was the genuine and heartfelt one, shy but generous.","shy but generous","generous","but",FALSE,"shy but generous","shy",NA,NA,0

I moved in a couple of months ago with two roommates. I feel like I have been very considerate and conscientious with them. We were all strangers when we first moved in March 1 but they quickly buddied up. They definitely get in disagreements with each other that I stay out of but when ever one of them has a problem with me, the other one has to back them up. It sucks feeling bullied in my own home. I mostly stay  in my room now but today I am just so frustrated with them. I came home after a literal 16 hour work day that they knew about and I noticed the bathroom me and one roommate share didn’t have any toilet paper and I went out to the living room and asked the other roommate if I could have one roll of his. It’s fucking toilet paper, like who would care? And this is the first time it has ever happened. But his response was “why don’t you guys have toilet paper?” I don’t fucking know, because we are pressing our own out of leaves but they’re still drying?? No, we just didn’t realize we were low. And I said the latter word for word and he stared at me for a solid 10 seconds. Finally I said “fine I’ll using my hand to wipe” sarcastically, and he responded “ok!” And I said “thanks for the fucking help” and I went and got shoes and asked out loud If Walmart was open and the only thing the other roommate said in the conversation was then, “yep!”. Anyways, Walmart was closed, I might be overreacting because I’m tired and frustrated but I want to do something. If I tell them “I feel like I have been considerate and generous but I am not getting the same in return” and take all my shit out of common areas so they can’t use it, AITA? I had the most stuff when we moved in, plates, bowls, cups, pans, the furniture, etc. if I tell them they can’t use any of the stuff that is not possible to replace (ie couch, there’s not room for two) is that wrong? Also, they have been disrespecting my things, the plates are chipping which they had 0 chips since I got them 1.5 years ago until now, they don’t take care of other things when they use them, leave my thermoses in their cars for weeks, break cups, etc.

"fscn33k","I would not tell my family about the winnings until I develop a plan with my financial advisor(s), but I would definitely tell them once the plan gets hammered out. I think people close to you, especially family who love you, will respect the plan you have for the money if you're upfront about it and don't deviate from the plan you have. For myself, I'm not going to gift cars or houses. (Occasional smaller ticket items like clothes, jewelry, artwork, bottles of wine/liquor etc. are a possibility however.) Instead I plan on paying off their debts (mortgages, credit card/student loans, car payments, things like that) and setting up college funds for nieces/nephews. It gives them the freedom of doing what they please with their own earned money: save it, invest in the stock market, start a small business, whatever.

- it increases competition and drives down total cost of ownership right now.
- revenue will tend towards billions over time and any additional uplift to EPS is welcome

Some points:
- with all the cameras on the car this will likely help claim and payout validation which reduces costs beyond usual
- agree that regulation is hard to get into but the data they’re collecting is pertinent to pricing insurance and it should not be excessively hard to convince the regulator of this as time goes by
- yes capital reserving and reinsurance is more difficult but they’re outsourcing this at the moment. As time passes and as the wider company earns more money they can bring it in house with more resources available. Not an insurmountable problem. They could potentially secure much lower reinsurance premiums as FSD progresses.
- margin including SGA was a bit generous but unlikely to outweigh other prudence
- 33% market penetration right now seems fair but this could tend to 100% with robotaxi’s and subscription based driving. Yeah it might be 5 years away but that’s a highly sensitive assumption as it could increase your numbers up to a factor of three, so I’m surprised you didn’t mention it.
- potential to expand product lines into home insurance if they ramp up solar roof/power wall installations and do combined product discounts
- 50% annualised car growth seemed sensible but would have been good to see a range on that number, I personally think 50% will be at the lower end of the range

"fnhpgtq","&gt;I'll start, for me (PPF) it was a series of experiences of realizing that every single man I ever slept with or did anything with (all LTRs) had almost zero concern for how I felt or what I wanted - even if he did, it was for the sake of an ego boost to himself and not out of care.

Did it ever occur to you that maybe this has something to do with the type of men to whom you are sexually attracted?

Because that would dovetail with both RP philosophy and the experience of many men (myself included) that when we are caring, loving, generous, considerate, and emotionally sensitive people women won’t even look in our direction.  

Then we observe the guys who women are choosing and we mold ourselves into that pattern.  We adopt the DNGAF attitude, lock our hearts into the gun safe, become stoic, and only look out for ourselves.  Then, all of the sudden, we’re swimming in attention from women, not infrequently *the very same women* who wouldn’t give us the time of day beforehand. 

You mold us with your sexual choice behaviors starting from about the fifth grade up.  **If you don’t like what you’re getting, choose differently.**  Most of us wish you would because it would allow us to express ourselves more fully.  We want to be loving and caring and generous, but when we are you punish us for it with the loss of your sexual attraction.  So we learn not to be those things which you *say* you want, but you never actually choose. 

There are *many* men out there who will have *plenty* of concern for “how you feel” and what you *say* you “want.”  They will genuinely care.  But you don’t choose to share yourself intimately and sexually with those men *because they’re not* **actually** *attractive to you.*

Until they are, and you and your friends start sharing yourself intimately and sexually with those men you should expect more of us to transform ourselves into that to which you truly are attracted as exemplified by your track records.",1586966576,"we want to be loving and caring and generous, but when we are you punish us for it with the loss of your sexual attraction.","caring and generous","generous",NA,FALSE,"caring and generous","caring",NA,NA,0

"fn0ahuw","Go to https://tdeecalculator.net/ and run your stats at 195 and again at 160.   You'll see your ""maintenance calories"" at both weights and the difference between them (probably about 150 Calories or so).  

So the answer is, yes, you will have to get used to eating less, but only a little less.  

&gt; my physical activity has gone way up over the past few months. My metabolism shouldn't have changed, right?

Perhaps a little, but we adapt well to any new state of physical activity.   It's best to keep the weight-management about food-management.  Keep the fitness and conditioning about our physical activity.   In small ways, they both complement and conflict with one another.  

Rarely is it the right move to try to fix weight problems with fitness; and, never is it the right move to try to fix fitness problems with diet.

&gt;  I'd feel a lot less anxious about the maintenance part of weight loss if I had confidence that I was already capable of doing it.

You know how to lose weight, and maintenance is a more-flexible and generous but 'forever'-duration effort like the one you've been on.   You absolutely can do it, as far as what it takes.  The difference becomes the calendar -- you've done this since the beginning of February -- can you now continue this surveillance of yourself until next February?  And the next one?  And so on?   

As a practical matter, it looks like daily bathroom scale checks, and keeping your food and fitness in check.   It's not hard, but it is not effort-free.  It's constant but it's not obsessive.  

I will be at 5 years maintaining next month, after decades of Class II and III obesity.   It's harder for me, but if I can do it from that great distance, you can do it from 195 to 160.  

I am concerned with how short a time it took you to lose.   The next three months might be tough as you did not have much time to learn anything useful.   It's okay, though.  You can do this.   EXPECT TO STRUGGLE and even expect to fail.  As long as you don't surrender, you just keep trying.

"fn092j3","I met a lot of well-known artists in my days working in music and media, and most of them didn't make any particularly strong impression on me. They're working people, and it's hard work, and most of them are no more or less remarkable than other people we may meet. But a few stood out to me for various reasons. There's a lot I could go with, but I'll just pick three.

\- I rode one floor in an elevator with Sting (and some others). We didn't speak or make eye contact, nor were we introduced. It's about as ephemeral and meaningless an encounter as there could be. And I want to concede also that this was a long time ago -- decades now -- and I no longer remember it clearly, but instead only dimly remember the impressions I got at the time, which may well have been distorted by my own cringeworthy personality at the time. But what I told people then and for some time later is that he seemed to me to radiate an aggressive air of arrogance. I felt like he was a real asshole, but the really super-smart kind that you can't possibly get the better of. I may have been wrong. Looking back, I perceive the person I was at that time to be kind of an asshole, so maybe I was projecting. I think now that how I talked about it then was stupid, because such a fleeting interaction can't mean anything, and it's totally unfair to him. All I can say is that the **feeling** I had about it at the time was strong and persistent. I just can't validate it now, even a tiny bit.

\- When I first saw A Flock of Seagulls on MTV, I immediately formed a raft of assumptions about them that were probably all wrong. And one in particular I got to **prove** I was dead wrong about: Mike Score, the one who's famous for his hair (obliquely referenced in *Pulp Fiction*) struck me as a stereotypical short, skinny, and probably sour-witted Brit. This stereotype, like all of them, has a basis in truth, informed by the testimony of many club workers I knew, who sourly talked about 'tea-baggers' (UK artists), who they said were difficult to work with. But years later, I got to meet Mike, and he flipped all that on me. First of all, the man I expected to be short and skinny is a mile-high, ham-fisted slab of a Yorkshireman. He has to duck going through doorways. Second, he's one of the warmest and most generous musicians I've ever met, and I've met plenty. So let me testify: TV can greatly distort reality, even when it's not trying to.

\- Ani DiFranco may be the most honest person I've ever met. Bullshit is a part of this business, and it's extremely difficult to avoid, and extremely difficult to avoid doing it yourself. I know that I engaged in enormous amounts of bullshit when I was involved with it. Everyone did. Except Ani. It was very diarming for me, because she just comes right out and speaks her truth, and lets the chips fall where they may. She could fall all over herself apologizing for any possible offence, but wouldn't let that stop her from saying what she felt was true. I mean, she wrote the line, ""If you're not angry, then you're stupid, you don't care"". It's harsh, but it's unvarnished truth. Or: ""If you're not trying to make something better, then you're just in the way"". These are things that need to be said, and that people need to hear, but far too many people are unwilling to say, for fear of offending othes. Ani hates offending people, too, but feels more strongly that important truths need to be spoken. Her success isn't just a product of luck and a lot of work. It's also a product of that kind of raw honestly. Even when people don't want to hear it, they still recognize it for what it is, and connect to it viscerally. That was my experience with her.

This situation could go on for multiple months maybe even up to a year. And it shouldn’t fall on the land lord to eat the entire cost. I would think for most landlords not collecting any rent for 6 months or for a year is going to be problematic. 

My point is that people shouldn’t be expecting free or even reduced rent. If a landlord can afford it and opts to cover tenants rent that’s amazing and generous.

That had little effect on us, since my grandpa had a few million and took care of us until my dad ended up opening a few businesses. 

I grew up getting thousand dollar checks from my grandparents for my birthdays and crystal souvenirs and stuffed animals from almost every country in the world because my grandpa was traveling the world during retirement. 

My dad came from money, but my parents were still somewhat frugal. After my grandparents died, there were lawsuits over the estate and it tore the extended family apart. 

Then my dad died. 

My mom never worked, so I was taken out of private school and attended public school. Life went downhill fast. 

My mom is a hoarder, so I moved out a week after graduating. Life insurance and investment accounts have helped her keep our family home, but that’s it. I have no contact with my family or siblings because they’re nasty, jealous, spiteful people. My grandpa opened a college tuition fund account when I was a child so I’m currently getting my masters. 

Losing almost everything has made me pretty bitter. I know there’s good in the world, but my family is full of terrible people.

However, the more time went on, the more I realized I was hostile and overall annoyed by our lack of chemistry in every other aspect of our relationship, so much so that I projected it onto him and avoided him every chance that I got.

He may not understand how intangible some of his money is... if you'd like to help him with his finances, and he agrees, it's no problem. But he needs to agree... you ALSO need to be firm with your boundaries and what you find acceptable from a fellow adult. Autistic or no, you have needs and values that should be respected--like being paid on time for bills. 

If I were you, I'd do the following: 

- Potentially talk to a lawyer about becoming a fiduciary for your brother. Basically, you might be someone that balances money for them if they are unable to do so. This sounds like what you're going to be moving towards, and it might be helpful to find out if this is an option for you... You can also approach his work and see if he is contributing to 401Ks and setting some money aside for retirement--if not, you might want to sign him up for things like that. Those can be above many peoples' heads in terms of understanding them, and they come right out of the paycheck easily. 

- Open a bank account that you have access to and have your brother's money become direct deposited into that account. 

- Have a second account for your brother's spending and saving money. He has access to the spending account, but not the savings and direct deposit accounts easily. If he is paid bi-monthly, transfer money as needed into 3 different accounts--the bills into yours, savings, and spending... But... 

- I highly recommend the spending money be set up with an auto-transfer weekly instead of paycheck to paycheck. It might be slightly less money, but if it's in an account he cannot draft more than he has out of, he won't mess it up. Having $50 a week is more tangible and renews more readily than having $200 at the beginning of the month. It can also help him understand his money in a smaller scale way. 

- So what do you do with expenses such as gas money, food, etc? You can do a couple things... either have an expenses account that's set up similar to the spending money and allow him to operate on that if he can... or you can withdraw cash and give him cash for those items whenever he needs them. I don't know what your brother does to handle things like that or what he's capable of, but I'm sure you can find a balance where you aren't having to micro-manage things.

Am I the asshole accepting dinners and presents from a girl I'm not interested in? I'm a 19 year old lesbian; who got out of a really toxic relationship around 8 months ago, but now I've brought myself back in the dating world. Recently I've been seeing this one particular girl; she's very lovely and generous but it's clear she likes me more than I like her. I'm not really wanting to rush into anything after my last relationship, but I like the attention I'm receiving. I've told her I don't want a relationship and I see her as a really great friend but I see her nothing more than a friend. I'm still accepting her gifts and her taking me out but only in a platonic way - like I'm not forcing her to take me out and I can't really tell her how to spend her money but i dunno something in me feels pretty awful as it can be seen as me using her but she seems to be happier since I've been hanging out with her at least? but I guess it's not great that i'm accepting them as she has different intentions for them to effect my judgement: I would stay her friend even if she stopped treating me this nicely but yeah...i dunno its just very conflicting in my head

"feokpkz","They don't want to admit they're wrong.  I'm a Christian and used to be a Republican.  I voted Republican my whole life for the same reasons many of the people here say they support Trump e.g. economy, freedom of religion (Merry Christmas), etc.  Also, growing up outside Seattle in the 70's the hippies were so crazy I didn't want to be associated with them.  Christians voted Republican for so long it was just what I did.  But Trumps ascension in the Republican party showed me that Republicans are no longer Christian but Machiavellian.  As long as they get their way, it doesn't matter how they get it.  They've institutionalized corruption.

It's not that I didn't hear about the corruption in the Republican party before, I just didn't want to believe it.  This is the same as people saying ""can't vote for a Democrat"" so what other choice do I have?  They just think ""Democrat = bad"" without doing any of the research into the policy proposals.  It's difficult to admit that something you've believed all your life is just wrong.  And if they're wrong about this, maybe they're wrong about other things, e.g. they're religion so they refuse to change their mind.

That's what I was trying to say, yes.

&gt; We can only speculate, but considering the low overall quantity of Ice Lake laptops compared to Comet Lake laptops I they might have improved their yield rate to 8-10% WITH a working GPU, but I doubt it is better than that.

I'm willing to even grant them the benefit of doubt and would guess they've managed to even reach the ballparks of +20%, which is fairly generous, but also manageable – depending on what is broken on 10nm.

&gt; Intel devoted quite a lot of capacity to 10nm and these few Ice Lake chips are all there is to show for that. The yields must still be abysmal or there would have been no need for Comet Lake U CPUs.

If his dad was really so religious he would have worked to provide instead of putting it on his son's shoulders.

It's interesting that his family have conditioned him to give them every penny and you think that's him being caring and generous. But the idea he would spend similar amounts on his wife makes you think of her as high maintenence and a waste.

"f8c81u9","1st question: I would not think that unfair, but have nothing more to say on the topic.

2nd question: there's 2 things you have to consider here. I'll use the D&amp;D system/world to talk about them since it is the one I'm most familiar with, apply my answer to your world by adjusting what needs to be adjusted.

1st part of the answer: real-life currency equivalence. Using a few items from the source books, I calculated that, for common expenses, 1 copper piece = roughly 1€ (or 1$ or whatever), so a silver is 10 and the famous gp is about 100. A common inn asking for a gp for a basic bed and supper would be overcharging. Offering a royal guard a bribe of 5gp would be insulting, etc. 

I had a DM who used to say that I didn't realise what a gp was worth, that it was basically a whole month's salary for a guard, and he was right, I thought of a gp as a € until I checked it myself.

2nd part of the answer: what is a PC in relation to a normal person? To put that in perspective, NPCs are lvl 0. Being lvl 1 is already ***being a hero***. A local hero perhaps, like that guy who saved the neighbour's daughter from drowning, but at lvl 1, you shouldn't be begging for soup at the crossroads. A king should be lvl 15/20, depending on the importance of the kingdom. Lesser gods are lvl 25, etc. 

Here, I read something that went along the lines of ""oh, am I being too generous, my lvl 8 fighter just got a half plate (450gp) armor"" and I was like ""wtf""? 1000 gp is usually what my table gets between lvl 1 to 2, although I'll admit I tend to give them a bit too much and ramp up the monsters to make the fight fairer. However, at lvl 8, your name carries power ***worldwide***, you should be dressed properly by then!

When I started DMing, I used [this table](https://www.dndarchive.com/forums/depth-roleplay-qa/character-wealth-level) to know roughly how much my players should get. This is for 3.5th edition, but it can be scaled up or down to suit your needs, the formula will stay the same. 

For magic items, there was also a way to calculate a total price from all the characteristics (spell, number of charges, restrictions, etc), however it was specific to 3.5 and I only have the tables in French. If you can read/speak it I can link them to you.

Wealth is relative however, so if you give less to your players, make the enemies less powerful, or do as I do and be generous but hurl difficult encounters/quests at them. 

Finally, if you feel like you made a mistake at some point and have given too much, stuff gets stolen, confiscated or broken all the time.",1574454604,"wealth is relative however, so if you give less to your players, make the enemies less powerful, or do as i do and be generous but hurl difficult encounters/quests at them.","generous but hurl","generous","but",FALSE,"generous but hurl","hurl",NA,NA,1
"f7v972w","Inaccurate for how poor these assumptions are. First, I don’t think 2.2 billion people would qualify as “gamers” especially if the definition is an average of 3.5 million AI kills. About a third of the worlds population lives on less than $2 a day so they’re probably most out in terms of there being any gamers among them. So that leaves you with almost 50% of the remaining people being a hardcore gamer? Doesn’t make sense. 

Even if the estimate of gamers is accurate, or if we loosen the definition to anyone who’s ever played a video game, 3.5 million AI kills is absolute nonsense. Let’s assume this average gamer games for 4hrs/day, which is extremely generous, but not too extreme such that you couldn’t maintain the rest of your life around it. With the very bad and generous assumption that they’ve all been gaming since games were popular (~30 years) and assuming that all games involve some type of killing AI, then: 

3.5E9kills / 30yrs. * 1yr / 365days * 1day/4hrs gaming

= 79.90 kills/hr of gaming = 1.33 kills/min

"f6pn675","This is currently a trigger topic for me as my wife and I are going through a similar situation. When we got married we opened both joint and separate accounts so we could both share in expenses but also have some individual financial freedom. At the time, we moved in with her parents to save first for the wedding and then for a down payment on a house. After the wedding my wife quit her job and showed no interest in finding something new (outside of some low paying, very part time work). That left the saving for the house up to me while living with her folks. They are wonderful people, kind and generous but living with my in-laws for 4 years or more was never anything I wanted. Eventually I saved enough money for the house and we moved out. I covered all house payments (taxes, insurance, etc) and the deal was she was to pay for some of the smaller bills out of her portion of the joint account (half the money I saved and all left over money from the wedding (part of my hope being that if she had clear expenditures, she would be motivated to find work and help contribute).

This is where it relates to the OP: I want us to have a fair and equitable splitting of bills and finances but it's clear now that I am concerned with saving for our future and she is not. I work harder and have sacrificed more in/for my carrier, therefore I make more. At this point I feel like anything she wants is up to her to come up with the money for (as the joint fund is starting to run dry).

"f5d6xkc","I practice property law (land use/zoning in particular) and this movie is BS. The entire movie I was shouting “adverse possession”.  The lead is a horrible lawyer for not even considering that the fact that the specific part of the land they are suing over includes her father’s pumpkin patch which was clearly being used in accordance with the elements required to establish a valid claim of adverse possession (open, notorious, and hostile). Also let’s not forget that even if Aunt Mary had an ownership claim it was negated by the fact that she believe he owned the property in the first place since years prior she and her husband had tried to BUY IT from Claire’s dad. 

The only real part about this woman’s legal experience is she found the most complicated way to attack the complaint of trespassing by counter suing instead of just asserting an affirmative defense of adverse possession.

The offer to settle by redrawing the property lines was unnecessarily generous but understandable since property disputes like this get ugly fast.

All Ilvermorny students' robes are fastened by a gold Gordian Knot, in memory of the brooch Isolt found in the ruins of the original Ilvermorny cottage.""

\_I have to point out that the colors on Pottermore are more brick (orangish) red than cranberry (rosish) red, and the blue is more teal (cyanish) blue than blue blue. I ended up somewhere between.\_

I wanted colors for Ilvermorny houses, as a more defined aesthetic also helps define associated house attributes. I tried a bunch and nothing ever stuck. But Ilvermorny is a different school, with a different approach. So I did the same! Even if this particular manifestation isn't exactly right, I like this idea direction.

Instead of hue like Hogwarts uses, I sorted versions of the school colors using saturation(intense-muted) and value (light-dark), with matching palettes/tones. These could be for accessories or sporting events, and the broader schemes idk.

"ezybju0","A typical overnight shift is probably about 11-7. If so, then it probably goes a little like this:

\- Come in, start. Find out what specials are, and what's out (no longer available). Find out anything special you need to know. (A machine not working, etc.) Make sure you know who else is on with you, and when, and what their roles will be.

\- Get ready for bar rush.

\- Bar rush. Busy period for 2-3 hours after bars let out, serving drunks and their friends. Most are friendly and generous, but some will be surly or dour or angry about something, and some will be withdrawn and want little interaction. Unruly or shitty drunks will have to be removed somehow, ideally without trouble. (Regulars will almost always leave if you just ask them to, and don't humiliate them in the process.) If there's going to be an incident inside or outside, it's likely to be during or shortly after bar rush. Drunks mostly like greasy food. Drunks are often messy, but they don't mean to be. They're just careless and uncoordinated. They're often loud, too, but usually they're just having a good time.

\- After-rush cleanup and lull. There will need to be a lot of work done putting the place back together after bar rush. This will be 2-3 hours after bar time. Tables, seats, floors, check bathrooms, restock stuff. There might be some broken shit or some shit stolen, or, in rare horrible cases, actual shit. Bar and club staff come in around this time, the middle of the night. They're usually sober (mostly), and usually reasonable if they're not (because they, too, mostly deal with drunks), they're often regulars and reliably good tippers, and usually order the same stuff every visit, and are more likely than many other customers to order plates to share (like a big plate of fries). They will tend to clot around one or two tables out of the way and talk a lot and drink a lot of coffee. They will talk about work between them, but not often with others.

\- Cops, firemen, and EMS show up in the middle of the night, too, often for 'lunch'. They usually eat healthier stuff, and often take it to go. They often know a lot of the bar and club staff, and vice versa. The middle of the night is usually a lull period, and if diner staff are done with post-rush work, they may have more time to talk with customers. Overnight diner staff will almost always know most or all uniformed regulars, and will often give them discounts that are set by the owner or manager. (It may seem like an obvious trope to give freebies to cops, but most of the time you follow the owner's policies, because it's too easy to be construed as bribery. That said, if you know the cops, you're much less likely to have trouble with them.)

\- Very late night moving into very early morning, you start to get a mix of early-bird workers (newspapers, trash, bakery, dairy, etc.), extreme late-night laggers from bars and clubs and other late-night businesses (managers, for example), middle-of-the-night travellers looking for a break from the road, and a number of all-night weirdos, and even criminals (who might work very late hours on busy nights). In one diner I used to frequent, drug dealers would come in around 4 a.m., since they've gotta eat, too -- but they usually took it to go, because they don't like hanging out in places that cops also go. And they're way more polite than you might expect, and often stud tippers to boot; I guess it's all part of avoiding trouble and attention.

\- Starting 4 or 4:30, you get ready for the early-bird diners (the first and usually lesser breakfast rush). Post breakfast specials, which you might briefly discuss with the cooks. Do coffee setups (pre-filled coffee filters, so that you can slap in a new one right away). Depending on when your first morning regulars usually show up, you will make coffee 10-15 minutes ahead of that time. For the next few hours, coffee will be overlapped to make sure it cannot run out.

\- By 5 a.m., breakfast rush starts, with the earliest commuters. Most of these will be regulars. Some will not be, but instead starting their day, maybe for a long trip.

\- By 6 a.m., breakfast rush is in full swing, with a mix of regulars, some-timers, and first-timers. People who start work at 7 will be there in numbers, and must be served promptly. Some of them will take to-go orders.

\- From then till 8ish, it's like bar rush, except that everyone's sober and many of them are in a bit of a hurry. Coffee flows like a river. An overnighter probably leaves around 7, but might stick around a bit longer if it's unusually busy.

They will **not** want to hang out after work, but instead go home and crash.

Almost all restaurant workers eat at work, either before or after or in the middle of their shift when the place is not busy, and get a free mid-range meal or discount better meal, and usually free coffee and soda.

Other staff will include at least one cook, probably at least one other server, and possibly an overnight manager. Large and busy diners might also have the diner equivalent of a barback, to handle stuff like cleaning tables, checking the bathrooms and parking lot, and providing extra muscle when needed.

All-night diners are often after-hours annexes for whatever's around them. On one street that had several gay bars and 'gentlemen's clubs', bar rush was a riot of drag queens and dancers. These are working-class patrons, who have great respect for other working-class people, and are great patrons and great tippers. Another all-night diner I used to frequent was, for reasons I never found out and didn't try to, popular with local prostitutes. They also make great patrons and tip well, and keep to themselves. Large diners near music venues will attract performers and crew before showtime, and sometimes hours after. One very large diner I used to go to a lot had a separate and very nice private banquet room just for those folks.

By now, you might be wondering how I know all this. Besides working diners myself, I've also been one of the all-night weirdos mentioned above.

"exj9vkc","I'm in Québec, Can

I don't believe he have an equivalent of area 51, but we do have the Wendigos(windigo, weindigo are all variants). Wendigos are forest spirits that live in big forest areas. They are usually part human, part deer and wear all kinds of talismans and other spiritual objects. The translation of Wendigo in english from Cri language is Cursed Cannibal.

&amp;#x200B;

There are three versions of the Wendigo that go around. The first one says that Wendigos are children of Greed and Anger. When a Wendigo kills, it will always strive for more blood to shed. The biggest the Wendigo, the deadliest. The legend says that if you commited the sin of Pride or greed, you would turn into a Wendigo once you died(native americans being animists). It was a reminder for Natives to always share and never shed blood, or the Wendigos would come at night to take their lives.

Second version is about cannibalism, and probably the most well-known. Basically, if you practiced cannibalism, even for saving your own life, it was considered extremely bad. Algonquiens would cast you out of the village and you would transform into a Wendigo at night. In Algonquien mythology, cannibalism was severely punished. If you were hungry, the solution was suicide or letting yourself die from hunger. This Wendigo legend was probably a warning for the northern people during the winter. If a famine was to strike, the members of the clan wouldn't turn against each other.

The last version of the Wendigo says it is a forest spirit. If, for example, you were kind and generous towards the forest, the Wendigos would help you during a time of great need(lost in the forest, nothing to eat and so on). If you weren't generous, but weren't a complete asshole either, they would leave you alone. Sometimes, you would hear their call, sometimes branches cracking. Now, if you were an asshole by littering the forest, cutting down trees you didn't needed, killed animals unethically(causing pain) or polluting the water, the Wendigos would haunt you at night. From what I've learned when visiting my grandma(she's 50/50 Mohawk and Cri) you would have three days to correct your mistake. The first day was to acknowledge your mistake and coming up with a plan. The second day was to correct the mistake, so if you killed a deer for fun, you had to burry it and make a memorial, if you polluted you had to pick up your trash, if you cut a tree, you had to offer it to someone in need. The last day, the Wendigos would appear to you at night. Then you had to apologize to them and promise never to set foot in the forest again with the intention of ruining the balance. If your apologies were sincere, the Wendigos would scare you off. If not, they would kill you on spot. If you tried to quit the forest during the day, they would set traps to make you stay until night. And the worst part, when you think their call is coming from far away, they are actually just next to you.",1566345172,"if, for example, you were kind and generous towards the forest, the wendigos would help you during a time of great need(lost in the forest, nothing to eat and so on).","kind and generous","generous",NA,FALSE,"kind and generous","kind",NA,NA,0

Farming Squad is still looking to add a few more active members, and there’s still plenty of time to join before the next Derby starts!
⭐️Required level to join is 65
⭐️We do tasks 310+, 320+ for special derbies, and 400 for mystery. 9/9 tasks required, 10th task is optional (we never require you to spend diamonds)
⭐️English speaking only!! No exceptions, we have tried it in the past and it just makes it too hard to communicate. 
⭐️We are a well established NH (started March 2017), competing in the champions league. In champions league competition we have won 50 times, placed second 28 times, and third 10 times. 
⭐️We have two basic rules. First is that we leave all watering/reviving for those on help task during the derby. On Monday’s and during help events this rule is suspended. You can help with boats, truck tasks, and town visitors at any time. The second rule is that if you do happen to fail a task we ask that if possible you do complete a 10th task (again we would never require you to buy diamonds).
⭐️We have a Facebook page as well as a Facebook messenger group to help us all stay connected and request help as needed. 
⭐️If you are just looking for expansion items or for us to fill all your crates and truck orders our NH is not for you. We are very helpful and generous, but we expect it to be a two way street.
⭐️We do not immediately promote. If you complete all your derby tasks for at least 2 weeks and are a good fit for the NH we will promote to elder at that point. We have members across several time zones so tasks are deleted regularly.

We are a fun, helpful, and active hood seeking like minded members. We have lost some inactive members as of late so we are hoping to find some new friends to join us! If we sound like a good fit for you please check us out! We hope to see you soon!

"es2q6nu","Weird way of putting it. You can go to your roommates and say ""hey, I know we signed that lease together but here's a new idea for our lease: I pay less for the same deal"". Nobody would describe that as ""suggesting a new agreement"", they'd call it asking for a discount.

It's fine to ask her partner, they are partners after all. But he has every right to say no and is not an asshole for doing it. She's not asking for a fairer deal, she's asking for charity.

Losing her jobs would be an entirely different situation, as that's an unfortunate event that she didn't plan for. Her current situation however was entirely planned for, she's just now decided she wants to save more and so her boyfriend should foot the bill. She is literally just asking for an allowance from her boyfriend that she can save up.

He's not inconsiderate. Sure, he's not incredibly generous, but most people aren't. If anything, the biggest takeaway here about this couple is that OP is bad at financial planning and expects others to pick up her slack.

Have you ever had a lease or a mortgage with a partner? Because it doesn't sound like it right now.

"erp8bxv","Thank you for showing interest and approving the post, that’s most generous, and flattering.

So my testing on the timing hasn’t been extensive, but I can tell you with certainty it isn’t frame perfect (thankfully). 

The window the player has to press their swap weapons key while still storing the Death Machine seems to be pretty generous, but again, I’ve never actually tried to find precise timing for the trick, as I find I can complete it with 100% consistency by just pressing my swap weapon button as fast as I can. 

By that, I mean it’s an imprecise trick, but a consistent one. If a player is ready to do it, and they tried their best to press their button as soon as they could, they should have no trouble getting the storage to work. 

I’m sure I could analyze frame data and such to find the maximum window someone would have to make the trick work, but really, it seems generous enough to the point where I’d wager that just about any player can perform the trick with high levels of consistency. 

I know it sounds lazy and... well it is, unfortunately, and if I truly am the pioneer of this technique, I should learn more about it, but the difficulty of testing it with any amount of control or consistency is just something I don’t want to mess around with at the moment. 

But again, as I said in my post, if people have questions or are having trouble with the trick, I’d love to have a reason to look deeper into it, and help them out.",1561104675,"thank you for showing interest and approving the post, that’s most generous, and flattering.","generous, and flattering","generous",NA,TRUE,"most generous , and flattering","flattering","most",NA,1
"ernyc25","The best way to change the world is probably direct action, not donating to non-profits in a lot of cases. Most middle class people make on the order of a few hundred to a few thousand dollars in donations. If they could invest a substantial portion of their time into those problems instead, it's hard to imagine that they wouldn't create more good than their generous, but ultimately small donations.

My point isn't that these people aren't able to do anything to create change. It's that they are significantly hindered in their ability to devote themselves to creating change because they need to invest a substantial amount of time, energy, and the resulting money just to have a decent life. Moreover, fighting against the system in substantial ways often limits your ability to participate in it by making you a pariah to the groups whose interests you are fighting against (either directly or indirectly).",1561063853,"if they could invest a substantial portion of their time into those problems instead, it's hard to imagine that they wouldn't create more good than their generous, but ultimately small donations.","generous, but ultimately","generous","but",TRUE,"generous , but ultimately small","small",NA,"ultimately",1

You threw a rock, which is an attack roll, and he let you intimidate them as a free action, which is generous, but understandable.

You might have felt that a different skill might have applied, but he’s Rule 0ing the situation, so appreciate his generosity. 

If I was in a melee, some random person throwing stones wouldn’t be my focus over the person actively in my face, attacking me.

This is why it’s a class feature or a spell that allows things that mechanically enable taunts.
Consider that in your situation, you would have also compelled him to provoke an attack of opportunity from your cleric, just to come after you.

If your insults were that snappy, wouldn’t they be something more like a bard’s cutting Words or vicious mockery? 

This is a cantrip or resource dice that behaves similar to how you described your action: an insult so slick it actually distracts the enemy, subtracting from their roll, or hurting them and granting disadvantage on their next attack rolls.

You understand how granting you the ability to do something a class feature does, at will, is incredibly powerful?

She had the same complication both times- she ""super donated"" eggs, meaning the process caused her to body to release dozens or hundreds of eggs instead of a small amount.  She looked like she was 4 or 5 months pregnant at some point during the process.

""Super donating"" was kind of an emergency situation.  The clinic says, ""This rarely happens""

Despite all this, she decides to donate a 2nd time, she's just a super generous woman.

"epbnu5y","Go to Redfin, find an acceptable home, and change the down to 3.5%.  This will give you an *idea* of what you'll spend on a mortgage payment w/ taxes, PMI, etc. each month. My cursory search shows a monthly payment of $4000-4500 for a home in the mid-to-high 600s, assuming a fairly generous, but probably realistic-ish 4% loan.

You'll probably find a lender who will find this acceptable, but you'll be very close to the top of your budget.  Because you're so close, you probably don't want to pull the trigger immediately.  Instead, take the difference between $4500 and your current housing cost, and add it to your down payment savings for at least 6 months (a year is better).  This will help you increase your savings, while also giving you an idea if you can really budget around the higher housing cost.

1. My Ex: - fun, social guy who was extremely caring and generous. But at the same time he was extremely critical and nit picked me &amp; aspects of our relationship although he later admitted he did it because he was desperate for attention. Liked to take things easy &amp; play it by ear which honestly freaked me out lol. In return he thought I was too rigid &amp; had no chill &amp; was too serious. Also quite ignorant about things that don’t immediately concern him. Extremely sentimental about the people and things he loves. Craves a deeper, bigger meaning to life; always trying to connect to people on a deeper level.

2. One of my best friends: also extremely fun &amp; social although lowkey introverted &amp; self conscious. Doesn’t care for authority figures &amp; does as she pleases. Does things at her own pace at her own time. Can sense what people are feeling very easily and breaks down other’s barriers very easily. Can act without sense at times even if you try and help them. Treasures her friends deeply and communicates her love through quality time &amp; talking &amp; splurges on birthday gifts! Can be reckless in relationships too

She somehow makes everything sound interesting). Extremely honest, can’t tell a lie. She’s direct &amp; straightforward too. Materialistic yet loves nature.

"emq94fk","Some great answers in here already. 

It may be really hard to see on the surface, especially with females. 

But there is no way you'd mistake a 9 and a 2 if we lined them up next to each other.

A 9 typically is not image oriented at all, preferring an air of ""au naturale"". Easy going, loose and typically very modest and quiet.

Twos can certainly appear humble, and be quite nice and generous. But they are considerably more image oriented, tending to really care how they are perceived. They have a much stronger, ""Ego"", desires, wants and sense of self. Thus expressing theirselves much more directly, including their emotions. Whereas, 9s are also strong, but more in terms of their will and truth-telling ability. 

I usually imagine the typical two as extroverted, warm, frilly- Kind of like the ""barbie"" (pink, showy, bold) and the typical nine is far less 'in your face' with their warmth, tending to be more coy and meek. Of course, 2w1s are less showy and can be quite modest, but it's in a much more strict/controlled manner (thanks to the double compliant fix). Nines aren't really 'self controlled' though they can be severely repressed/depressed/numb. 

I feel like I am such the opposite of a 2, in almost every way (as a 9w8) lol. I find twos like to have a perfect image, and to be sort of like, ""Blonde Bombshells"". And I am just not interested in that. The idea of being a sort of sweet stepford wife is repugnant to me. That said, I do have a very strong 3w4 fix, so ""individuality"" and ""edginess"" speaks more to me than sweetness. Despite being very sweet and gentle, I don't go out of my way to show that I am in every moment.

"elclo2z","Your post ended by talking about needing a backbone and by the comments thus far, we all support you in that. So you are on the right track, but we understand it’s easier said than done. 

You reminded me of when my husband had to put his foot down when my son was 18 mo and his grandpa (my sons great grandpa) was giving him snide comments about how to go easier on our son. (Ironically we were being much easier than he had ever been with his daughter, but I digress.)  This one specific day, he even bopped my husband on the head to make a point!  We left his house in a hurry with promises to never return until it was understood who was the parent here. It was very stressful as we were both raised to respect our parents... and grandpa wasn’t known to ask for forgiveness.

It took 3 days and he apologized in tears... one of the only times I saw him cry. He never crossed that line again. He is now gone and my son is 21 and we (including our kids born later) and our nephews all had healthy relationships with that grandpa for MANY years. It was WELL worth the immediate pain.  Bottom line there: Pick the battle!  

On that note...

First i would call your MIL and get her input on how this happened. She may not have gotten a clear story and may be innocent.  Confirm if she is interested in watching him the whole time. 

Take this serious enough to write out what you want to say to your parents ahead of time (even just some key points). What you’re expecting? What can they expect if they abide by that? Rude comments are passive bullying and should not be overlooked. This is YOUR child, it’s your job to find trustworthy care.  It’s a critical part of being a parent. 

Also include praise for some things they’ve done well. Try to “sandwich“ the hard between the praise.  

Discuss/Agree with your fiancé ahead of time and present this together with a unified front.  Even having a 3rd party trustworthy friend present can be helpful. It will help you stay centered and calm. Firm, but kind. 

Personally I would pray James 1:5 which is a dear promise where God says he WILL give us wisdom generously when we ask Him. 

Lastly, know that sometimes it is necessary to find non-family care for a day or 2 for everyone’s sake. Your MIL is generous, but young ones take time &amp; energy.

"ejo67e6","Leo Sun, Sagittarius Moon, Aquarius Rising.

I'm definitely a lot like Leo, except I don't *need* to be the center of attention all the time, and I'm very introverted. I am prideful, though, super loyal, I like putting effort into my appearance, I'm ambitious, creative, generous, but also stubborn, selective, arrogant, and fairly lazy with things I don't want to do/don't care about.

Sagittarius Moon describes me pretty well too. I love my freedom, and I love learning and travelling. I also have a huge tendency of needing to be right, but I'm also open minded too.

Aquarius Rising fits me as well. Again, I'm intelligent and creative, and also independent. At the same time though, I'm reserved, and can be hedonistic. However, I'm not really enthusiastic or energetic.

The combo fits my personality very well, though I would say the glaring difference is that I'm not loud, or a partier, or always trying to be the center of attention. I'm an INTJ as well, so I like to do my own thing, learn, create, travel, etc. which is a huge facet of my combo. Interestingly, INTJs are full of contradictions, and so are Leos, as well. I simultaneously think I'm the best thing in the world, but I also kind of hate myself (on a self deprecating humor type level). I'm extremely liberal and open minded, but I'm quick to judge people who I feel don't live up to my (admittedly, incredibly high) standards. I love learning and listening to people's stories, but I like being by myself in my own quiet bubble. I tend to view me showing emotion as a sign of weakness, yet I feel emotions more strongly than anyone I know.

Most of the time my punishments were “no Nintendo this week” or “you can’t see your friends outside of school for two weeks”, something along those lines, which worked way more than continuous spankings ever could have. One of my buddy’s dad is a very stern guy, super nice and generous, but stern. None of his kids ever go against his orders and he doesn’t even raise his voice at them, let alone lay hands on them. If dad tells them to do something, there’s no arguing or pushing back, they just know that they are now going to do that thing. All have been super well behaved kids as long as I have known them.

No, it is absolutely NOT easy at all to kill a Mummy Lord with a 5 player, level 5 party and to be fair, even if possible in theory. There are DMs who allow more and stronger magic items early game. If they reach the point of abundance of rares, I'd say they would actually have a pretty good chance out there, absolutely no need for legendaries. It would still be risky, of course, no cake walk, that's why I'm also quite surprised by Sword's statement. i get what he meant, it's possible, with good rolls, good stats and with good strategies, but not the most possible outcome at all.

&amp;#x200B;

I also don't have a clue about what you just said, that you would need a 15 level party of 4 to defeat a CR 15 monster. That's not true AT ALL, even if you have no magic items (and you should absolutely have some, at this level, even if avoiding very rares and legendaries like the plague). A level 9 party should be able to go pretty well with the most basic magic items, even if it would still be pretty hard. 

&amp;#x200B;

Spell-wise, while I agree the Mummy Lord is really strong, I really think that the spell would be fine if it didn't have it's legendaries.

"ef3tx40","^^^^AUTOMOD  ***This is a copy of the above post. It is a record of the post as originally written, in case the post is deleted or edited.***

My wife and I got married last year. We created a registry at Bed Bath and Beyond with all of the standard “young couple” items - plates, silverware, pots and pans, etc.  We got married fairly young and didn’t have a lot of nice, grown-up things.  My aunt is quite wealthy, very generous, and very old-fashioned.  At the wedding shower, she gave us four sets of Waterford crystal wine glasses and a Waterford vase.  She told us that “everyone needs to have a set of Waterford in their home.”  I expect that she spent about $1,000 in total. 

The glasses and vase are very nice. We use the vase, but literally have not touched the glasses.  They are very fragile and they have to be washed by hand. We don’t want to use them at a party because we don’t want to break them. In short, they are a pain in the ass. 

I appreciate my aunt’s rationale, but I would have much rather received something from our registry, like plates and dishes. If she was going to go off the registry, and spend that much money, then I wish she had asked friends and family for some insight. 

So, am I the asshole for being annoyed by my aunt’s generous, but useless, gift?

"ef3hp7r","Since the beginning of the Left-Right split, meaning the French Revolution, the ""Left"" has been a heterogeneous mixture. Socialists -- by and large, it doesn't apply to every tradition in the socialist label -- are more closely associated with the Montagnards which were only a few members of the Left. AFAIK Liberalism became associated with the right because the continental European parliaments were often split between nationalist liberal parties and nationalist conservative parties in the mid and late 1800s. But even then there were small liberal factions that were not in favor of ""laissez faire"".

I'm really talking mostly about the Vanguard Party types of socialism (although it was apparently adapted to Zionism and Islamism), so Blanqui, Lenin, Mao, Castro (also numerous insurgent groups in Latin America, Africa, and Asia, but I don't know much about their internal politics or economics). Perhaps I should've been more explicit there. Aside from Castro, all of those ran into the exact same problems I'm talking about. Castro was propped up by the USSR and ran into the same problems when they collapsed. If you want people to carry stuff to market there needs to be an incentive. That incentive is profit.

"ecw1868","Your post just made me burst into tears. My anger is my really destructive coping mechanism. I grew up in an abusive home and I channelled all the hurt to anger. I learned not to show weakness aka that I am human and that I can be hurt, so I just reacted with anger...then add years and years of your typical life of friends' betrayals, real and perceived slights and a world that is generally not a just and equitable place. I am a boiling, bubbling, steaming volcano of repressed emotions that when it finds a crack it pours out like this destructive red-hot lava of anger. I hate it.

Worst is that it is second nature now, anger comes so easily and instantaneously that I do not even have that split second to recognize it and try to use some techniques to blow that steam off in a healthy way. I only recognize it when it's already too late and I am doing or saying things that are either hurtful to others or self-destructive. I am in tears writing this because I absolutely hate it...just like you. What I am truly terrified of is being vulnerable...which is the crux of the matter. Like, right now most healthy normal adults would try to seek the comfort of their SO...I can't let him see me like this, you know, human. I have to hide the softness or lest be destroyed.

Trump is extraordinarily competitive. And he’s willing to get dirty to accomplish his goals. His friends say he’s very charming and generous. But as we’ve seen, if you cross him, you become his enemy.

These traits mean that he does a lot that’s unsavory, Trump supporters don’t like it any more than non-supporters. But these are extraordinary times. Who else could have beaten Hillary? Who else could reverse the global tide toward globalism? Who else is committed to bringing back coal and American industry to help the forgotten and sacrificed working class? Who else would go after China for it’s egregious trade practices and it’s 25 year plan to be the most powerful country in the world?

Integrity is a bit of a superficial luxury when the stakes are so high. The truth is very few politicians have it despite appearances. Take Bernie. He spends a lot of money flying private everywhere and recently bought a vacation home worth more than most Americans first home, if they have one. Aside from the money involved, his carbon footprint is many multiples of the average American. How is that consistent with his staunch support of climate change?

"eawvfi8","I often debate whether it is a blessing or a curse to be able to tell with ease and clarity when someone is lying. I am not an expert on body language or tells of deception, although over the years I have come to notice patterns. Before I even fully understood what lying was and why people would lie I could feel something different when I heard untruths.

Early Christmas' were intensely confusing. I would often feel uneasy around people. I never knew much about lying and deception so had not learned to link this feeling with that yet, so it was just confusing how people were jovial and generous but somehow upsetting.

It was through school I'd really honed my powers. Got to understand that what I was sensing was always related to deception. I would listen to kids telling their stories about why they could not do homework, or swear they were sorry and would not do it again. I'd listen to the teacher making hollow threats and class members making equally hollow indications of acquiescence.

Other than learning about my ability to perceive deception, and testing and confirming both that mines was strong and others significantly weaker, I had little interest in school. I would sometimes just start trouble so I could be kicked out of class and go to the place where all the other kids that had been kicked out of class went. These were the ones most liable to be lying and interesting to listen to.

I remember a teacher telling me he thought I'd amount to nothing, he was telling the truth. He was wrong, however. At 16 I'd managed to acquire a fake I.D and learned the basic rules of poker. I began to play in various pubs and casinos in low stakes poker games. It took me a while to get good at the game but from the very outset I knew when people were trying to deceive me. I'd made close to $100,000 by the time I was 18 and could use my own I.D. By this time I was somewhat micro famous, making this slightly awkward.

Then there are moments like this.

It often strikes me how many times people lie by mentioning the specific thing they want to hide. It would have been so easy for them to say, ""I do not have horns coming out my head"", or any number of various hyperboles. No. They picked ""alien"".

The best way to describe it when someone lies in a very unexpected way, with my sense of things, is like if you were to walk out on a road that seemed safe to cross, only to hear screeching brakes right beside you. The word ""alien"" making me almost physically jump in astonishment. I managed to contain myself, I've become phenomenally well practised in doing so, one has to to avoid too much attention.

""Not from Mars then, no?"" I try to keep it light-hearted but I do want to confirm.

""Nope, not me"", he replies. He is telling the truth.

I notice how dumb a question it was. I should have went with something more broad. Mars is one of the few places that apparently we (they) know a bit about and probably doesn't have complex creatures. I search my mind for a more tactful way to probe further.

""Just always been an Earthling, huh""?

""Is there anything else to be""?

Damn it! The old answering the question with the question. This really throws me off. His answer is not lying but it is not an answer. It implies we all know the same answer. This was a good deflection. I thought I'd had him well cornered with the ""earthling"" thing.

""Do you think aliens exist?""

""Maybe""

I cock my head at him and he turns away, acting like he is busying himself with organising some papers scattered across a coffee table.

I am not sure now to proceed. I do not know how they would react if I was to convince them I knew they were indeed an alien. What if they are not alone? What if this one is rather nice and friendly but me confronting the alien issue alerted other less friendly aliens?

""Don't you think it'd make sense there'd be something somewhere out there""?

""I can see why you'd think that"".

Ooh. For the first time I notice it. How through all the time I have known them, they have been side stepping so many questions so as to remain neutral or change the subject. This must be how I have not noticed anything before.

""What do you think""?, I think it is time to get pointed.

""What makes you think I think anything about it?""

OMG, this is like chess!

I just shrug, and fall silent as I contemplate what has just happened.

There are aliens. Furthermore, I know one. Further still, my unique powers work on aliens as well as humans. I try to remain humble but there are some considerations this may just make me the most deception aware advanced entity in the universe. Maybe not, but one step closer.

""You still thinking about aliens?"",  my friends voice bursts into my thoughts.

""Would you tell me if you were an alien? Hypothetically speaking?""

They take a couple seconds, then catch me off guard with a chuckle.

""I don't think anyone ever gets away with lying to you, do they""?

At first I am annoyed they have dodged the question and it takes a few seconds to sink in that they are telling the truth. That they must know! I feel heart beating faster, and I stumble for something to reply.

""But would you tell me?"", it is all I can think of. As I say it, it sounds dumb coming out of my mouth.

""If you were an alien, would you?""

They give me a fleeting knowing look, then turn on their heels grabbing their coat and starting towards the door.

""Got to get off, got a spaceship to catch"".

I sense no deception, but them being an alien is the least confusing part of all this now.

Edit2 -

Thank you to everyone for their feedback, votes and the 2x gold. Much appreciated.

I found this a lot of fun to write and was considering writing a part 3. However, upon consideration I think it would probably be a lot more fun to write the backstory, the discovery and development of the lie detection power, the initial meeting of “alien friend” and then the follow on from what is written here.

I was thinking about doing this in ongoing blog posts spanning over a few months or something, with altering perspectives between the two characters.

If you’d be interested in reading this, shoot me a message and will let you know once the first parts are up.

Though, seeing your reactions to what seem predictable comments in the other thread makes me fear that this app isn't long for this world. You're hoping to create a market where none previously exists, and a subscription model at that. You're swimming against the tide here, and your expectations should have been grounded accordingly. You've shown yourself to be quite thin skinned, and it would suggest that it wouldn't take much to push you over the edge of pulling the app somewhere down the line.

 I understand your need for compensation, and a sizable portion of the community agrees, even if it hasn't previously materialized into actual donations. Your initial thread posed the question of monetization, and what followed was a dozen threats to close down the app. A lot of your anger and frustration, justified or not, comes out of the blue for us. As others have pointed out, the initial selling point of your app was no ads. You've never talked about the need for monetization, so it took a lot of people by surprise. In one comment, you've mentioned that keeping sources current is a ongoing laborious process, and something that justifies an ongoing revenue stream. Fair enough, but how would we know if you've never told us this before today? AFAIK no other developers have pointed to this as a major time sink, so we assume collecting and testing sources is a simple task. People would assume that building the app is the major hurdle, and keeping sources current is mere administrative work. Complaining that people don't appreciate your efforts is futile if you haven't tell us just how hard you've had to work. There's a disconnect between your expectations and ours.

"e8oo014","My strategy, which is serving me well, is to only eat two meals a day. One of these is the same thing, with a pretty fixed calorie count. This means my second meal is pretty free to be anything I want.

I skip breakfast and ride out the morning on black coffee. For lunch, around 12.30pm I have the same thing every day, 3 eggs scrambled with a little butter, salt and pepper. This is a real hunger killer for me and usually keeps me satiated until 5pm especially if I keep drinking water.

I then eat pretty much anything I want as long as it's keto / low carb and fits on a single plate or a bowl. Usually it's a bunch of veggies, some protein and some fat e.g. onion, pepper, broccoli, ground beef, cheese and sour cream. Say 500-700 kcals?

I tend to get hungry again at bedtime but I'll guzzle water some more. If I get super hungry then I'll eat something small like a few nuts, a cube of cheese, a pickle slice, a chunk of chorizo, just to feel like my stomach isn't empty..

Am probably around the 1200 kcal range at most. Eating like this helps me drop 1-2 pounds a week with no exercise. After a few weeks of this routine I feel I've tamed my hunger. I still get hungry but far less than before and I know I'll be eating a big tasty meal by 6pm each day which helps. I also enjoy eating food out of hunger rather than boredom.

At the weekend I'll sometimes skip lunch too and have a cheat meal as a reward. Usually a pizza, couple of glasses of wine and a dessert. It probably slows my weight loss but it keeps me sane and helps manage any cravings that sometimes come along. I just get back on the proverbial horse the next day.

So, tldr, eat less, eat twice a day, kill that hunger with delicious eggs, enjoy one generous but low-carb meal a day.

This proves that they could do what we want, but they just refuse until you involve a third party.

"e5ec55z","Do all hard determinists share the idea that personal responsibility doesn't exist? I don't think so, and I'm also not totally certain that a determinist who believes in personal responsibility is being incoherent.


Prima facie, determinism does seem to eliminate personal responsibility because we presume that we can only morally judge people if they're truly making choices.  If there is no such thing as choice, then it seems like people shouldn't be held responsible for their actions. We have to note, though, that there are ways that people at least try to disarticulate free will from personal responsibility - and that their sentiments aren't clearly motivated by intuitions that strict and rigorous thinkers may endorse.


A philosopher can entertain the idea of a world where choice is impossible while endorsing choice-independent notion of personal responsibility without immediate contradiction.  As long as that philosopher remains committed to a fully-deterministic universe, he is a determinist who believes in personal responsibility.


A natural response to this point is to say that it's incredibly clear that personal responsibility must depend on choice - and at first glance, that seems like a reasonable.  However, the idea that personal responsibility only comes from choice is actually a minority position worldwide - the research on the difference in attitudes between the WEIRD (Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, Democratic) community and other intellectual cultures shows that most human beings almost explicitly endorse the idea that one can be held responsible for things they cannot control.  


A response to that point may be that those choice-independent conceptions of responsibility are results of culturally-determined superstitious thinking that we wouldn't endorse. But you don't even have to go outside of the WEIRD sphere to find endorsement of blame for things can't control.  Webhold that revenge against family members of wrongdoers is itself wrong - but we're not as upset by the firebombing of toddlers in Nazi Germany as we are by the bombing toddlers born to people in pro-social military movements.  We generally think it's weird that scripture describes God ""hardening"" the Pharaoh's heart, then punishing him for acting in a hard-hearted manner - but many in our society don't find it weird.  Many educated Christian's not only accept original sin, but find it morally gratifying.  Many people found the fact that Koreans in Korea apologized for the behavior of the Virginia Tech shooter to be not only generous, but coherent and admirable.  Many or most of us think that people are responsible for the care of children they were tricked/forced into having.

Aries Woman - I like them right away usually. They entertain me and I appreciate their willingness to be down for pretty much anything. 

Taurus Woman - I sometimes like them a lot off the bat, but they don't seem to get me. 

Gemini Woman - I like them, but I'm not as gossipy or as social enough to lock one in as a friend. 

Cancer Woman - Surprisingly, I don't think I'm sensitive enough to be supportive enough to them. They are creative, and great cooks, but when they get moody and needy I just can't take it. 

Leo Woman - They're lovely to talk to one-on-one, but if we're in a group together they seem like they don't like my independent style and are suspicious of my divergent opinions from the group's. 

Virgo Woman - If circumstances make us friends then we get along great, but otherwise these women seem to think I'm too surly and offensive to be acceptable. 

Libra Woman - I love them, they're creative and usually down for anything too, similar to Aries. 

Scorpio Woman - They're ok, but I don't trust them with my man. 

Sagittarius Woman - Love them. They're creative, but can be skeptical. However they usually are willing to analyze divergent opinions and ideas from their own and come out wiser on the other side. 

Capricorn Woman - If fate makes us friends we're thick as thieves, but otherwise I fucking hate them. 

Aquarius Woman - If fate makes us friends we have a good time playing around and being analytical together too, but in a workplace they usually are just suspicious of me because I keep to myself. 

Pisces Woman - Usually friends with them, but if they're opposite of my personality or are younger than me they can be unbearable and annoying. 


Aries Man - Chill friends and we can have fun together, but they're too aggressive and mean/cruel in a thoughtless way if they feel offended by me. 

Taurus Man - We can have good discussions one-on-one, and they can have a surprisingly warm disposition sometimes, but beyond those occasions I think they're sticks in the mud or way too fanatical about their personal interests. 

Gemini Man - I like their willingness to discuss anything under the sun at any given moment and I like how they investigate relationships between people and are able to apply that knowledge. 

Cancer Man - Can be best friends or can be dopey dunces and no in-between. Just depends on how their personality relates with mine. 

Leo Man - They're very nice and generous, but some of them are too attention/approval seeking from others for my taste. 

Virgo Man - Chill dudes. Like them. 

Libra Man - We can have good conversations, but they are too high-strung for me. 

Scorpio Man - I can usually understand their point of view even if I don't approve of it. They usually have very specific interests in life so if they don't align with mine we have no reason to be friends. 

Sagittarius Man - They're grating and rude. I can understand their intellectual approach, but they lose me with their judgmental nature. 

Capricorn Man - We can have fun and play together, but if they get moody with me just 1 time, I'll never forget the nasty shit they throw out of nowhere. 

Aquarius Man - Can be good friends, but it's not possible to get as close as they can with other people. 

Pisces Man - Can be good friends and have a nice understanding of our mutual sensitivity. But if fate doesn't bring us together for a purpose then I may just ignore them.

"e16v6fo","Grand purpose... of course I have a vision.  There are private and public aspects to my vision.  There are aspects which relate to humanity and those which transcend it.

Now, your grandpa here is tired of a power imbalance, and of the irresponsible, ignorant, crass and petty economic elites.  Therefore on the strength of my own wisdom and power, I am guiding this manifestation toward a democracy.  Now, when I say ""democracy"" it doesn't mean anything goes.  After all, I won't have a democratic vote on whether or not we should have a democracy, so right there I have a noble intent.

Why would your grandpa want a democracy, you ask?  It's simple.  I want a decent self-regulating system so that I am free to do things in my life besides governance.  If I consolidate all the overt power in my own hands in a public way, I will become married to the art of governance in a way which will leave me unable to step away from it.  On the other hand, suppose I allow a friend of mine to consolidate political power in this way.  Then I'll always have to worry about this friend, with so much power consolidation, turning against me especially while I am not looking, which of course I don't want to be.  The more consolidated power is in the hands of one or a few individuals, the more subject to a personal whim it becomes.  I want something a bit more stable than that.  And I want something that responds to the needs of the people, not because I am so kind and generous, but because when I disappear from the public eye and ""do my own thing"" I'll act as one of the people, so how a random person gets treated by the system is how I myself will be treated.  I cannot allow this grandpa of yours here to be mistreated under any circumstances.  And I want to live incognito.  1+1=2.  It means I need a system that treats everyone well so that I can then disappear into it.  That means everyone must have a political voice of some sort, including having a voice with regard to public policy.  Without that voice public policy will inevitably run away from some section of the population.

Anyone who tampers with this grandpa's democracy is my, your grandpa's, enemy.  Anyone who postpones elections (I'm looking at you, Scott boy) or spreads any kind of democracy-skeptical bullshit is my enemy.  Even the fact that the corporations are not run democratically by the workers who work there is already against my interests, especially if we're talking about large corporations with large power consolidations.  My absolute bare minimum is the Codetermination model used by the Germans.

I also want less war.

I want more religious tolerance, which ironically means I cannot tolerate the intolerant doctrinal elements of some religions.

Finally, eventually I will want to get off this planet, because I like exploring instead of sitting around on a fully mapped out and well understood planet.  Of course if everyone is busy picking up soda cans just to survive and fighting a bunch of meaningless conflicts, the amount of progress toward space travel is going to be very limited.  This conflicts with your grandpas desire to leave this planet.

So far I've mentioned a few things as they pertain to the public side of humanity.  Of course there is more to it than that, but that's for me to know and for anyone else to guess.

What I recommend is that you don't worry too much about what I want and become a sublime knower, master, and steward of your own perspective.

Meet your new pal, the character issues creation questionnaire. Role-play should add humor and goals, and give you fun quirks that while they hamstring you, force you out of your comfort zone.

I had always done sword n board or stealth archer. My first time with this I rolled a Breton with zero weapon skills. Archmage. Moral. Kind. And complete lawful good. Alteration and restoration. Gardens. Generous but prideful. That was Clemence. Such a great play through.

Now I'm a vampire who has been told by a friend who is a seer, to leave Cheydinhal, to go north and find the 'boy with black eyes' (a mod follower with a quest). Elanna Virane (not her birth name but one chosen as have ones prior so she can't inherit stuff from herself every generation or so). She is a stoic, except when it comes to food and blood. Better Vampires + iNeed to help make possible her gluttony in terms of taste sensations. Loathes other vampires as they could only serve to draw attention and pitchforks against her. No loyalty to anyone save two people who have been left behind in Cheydinhal. Last came to Skyrim fifty odd years back. Revels in extremes, but doesn't allow herself the pleasure often. Never complains. A sense of noblesse oblige. Ridiculous love of clothes. Hoarder of blood potions and bear mett. Terrified of falmer. Doesn't love history as a subject but studies it with fervor, out of the desire to see patterns emerging, to create some sense of control.

It creates options and combinations you might not think up yourself. 

By having Elanna constantly distracted by a bandit over there and her craving for blood...and her fear of any sort of sleeping around people...I'm not ever on autopilot. Elanna has me thinking in a way foreign to my own. And even if I have seen Skyrims quests, *she hasn't*.

Currently in (although new\-ish, about 2 months). This is pretty close to my read on it. I definitely see this progression from the Queen to King, as perhaps both of us rising to the occasion.

"e0bupsg","Certainly not the only reason.  Blizzard had a separate team for Diablo 3.  It took so long due to Blizzard closing Blizzard North in 2005, firing the senior Diablo dev team, scrapping their designs to-date, slowly rebuilding the dev team over time, and causing numerous redesigns throughout the process.  Other game projects certainly drew company resources away, but Blizzard - like most publishers - keeps their project teams largely discrete.

Also, it's Blizzard - they don't release a game until it's ready due to a high quality standard.  Arguably CIG has a similar standard.

Star Citizen is actually in a very similar situation.  CIG is splitting resources between Star Citizen and Squadron 42 (there's certainly overlap, but not all of it).

First of all, it is his child too. Unless you had an immaculate conception than the responsibility is 50/50.

And he is missing out on time with his daughter, he is never going to get that back. Yeah, there's not a lot of activities they can do together now, but this is when you build the love and trust in each other and that will lead to a beautiful father-daughter relationship on the long term.   
In terms of you going back to work and finances. If you want to go back to work than do it, it's not fair to put your life on hold just because he wants to play at the weekends. Also, you are married and have a child together. Your finances should really be a lot more shared. Looking after the house is work. Looking after your child is work.

"dyi5kdr","And generosity exists on a continuum I would say. It doesn't seem too useful to say there's some arbitrary threshold at which a person or a person's action is suddenly deemed as generous. Even in the CDs example, the guy is not being that generous, but it probably still would have been easier to throw them in the trash. 

&gt; In the example of the woman whose philanthropy is motivated by her desire for recognition, could you not argue that her desire to be recognized as a generous person is an extension of her genuine generosity?

I mean, I think even if you interpret her to doing it entirely out of selfishness, her wants are almost comically meager. She's not asking for much. If the public recognition and community award is all she's asking for in return for her (presumably substantial) donations, she's generous in the sense that she's giving something of great value subjective to the community and expecting something of very small value subjective to the community in return. Granted the award and recognition might be of equal or greater value *subjective to her*. So I'm inclined to say you can be both selfish and generous at the same time if the stars align in such a way that that kind of trade can happen.

There are analogs to more simple examples of people who do soup kitchens and the like because it makes them feel good and fulfilled. Maybe that emotional satisfaction in exchange for their time turns out to be an even trade for them. And then on the other hand, maybe you have a person that is doing all the same things purely because it's the right thing to do, but deep down they hate it, and they lack the empathy to derive joy from it. On the outside there might be no difference between those two people. Is the second person more virtuous because they are fighting their instincts to do the right thing? I suppose that's a reasonable counterpoint. 

But this is semantics at the end of the day, and I prefer the definition of generosity that paints them both as being the same. They are both intentionally giving their time which is equally valuable to the community for free.",1525550589,"so i'm inclined to say you can be both selfish and generous at the same time if the stars align in such a way that that kind of trade can happen.","selfish and generous","generous",NA,FALSE,"selfish and generous","selfish",NA,NA,0

"dyg8kkq","Yeah, I want to second what /u/KaliTheCat said. Boys and girls are still often raised very differently and with different expectations. My boyfriend is wonderful and extremely generous, but his parents didn't really see the value in teaching him basic household tasks as a child/teenager. Cooking was the biggest issue for us. I'm not a particularly good cook, but when my boyfriend and I first met, he couldn't cook anything. He didn't even own basic kitchen supplies like pots and pans. So even though he was eager to contribute and learn new skills, there were many things that I could just do faster and more efficiently—because I learned as a child—so I'd just kind of do them myself. Teaching someone else how to make a meal takes way longer than making it yourself, and most of us are pretty short on free time. It's an understandable decision. And this is more of a personal problem, but I'm admittedly kind of a control freak sometimes, and it's hard for me to watch someone do things differently than I would, even if they're still learning. I'd often be a little harsh if he did something that I felt obviously went against common sense, without remembering it might only feel like common sense to me because my mom taught it to me twenty years ago. Me snapping at him made both of us tense and compounded me just doing things myself.

A couple years ago though, I made a conscious effort to step back a bit and let him contribute in the ways he'd always been offering to. I was more patient with him while he was learning, and he's great at making dinners now. We usually alternate cooking. But as Kali said, it's complicated. Part of me felt like it wasn't his fault he didn't know any of this stuff—his parents never taught him or even conveyed it was beneficial for him to learn. But there was also a part of me that was really frustrated. He had been an adult living on his own for several years before we met, and he could've made it a priority to teach himself these things.

Women teaching their male partners how to take care of their home is really common, and that's an unfortunate reflection of the very real, but often subtle, sexism that is still present in our society. It really sucks. But in a situation like mine, it was beneficial to both of us for me to teach my boyfriend these things. And an important factor was his genuine willingness to learn them so he could contribute. My past partners weren't like that—they just expected me to do everything. To me, that's what makes all the difference.",1525457261,"my boyfriend is wonderful and extremely generous, but his parents didn't really see the value in teaching him basic household tasks as a child/teenager.","generous, but his","generous","but",TRUE,"wonderful and extremely generous","wonderful","extremely",NA,0

It’s not you that I’m talking about in the post, just so we’re clear. Your family likely worked hard and you happened to be born to a level of financial comfort. No shame or hard feelings. That’s the point of making money: to secure a future for you and your children.

I’m mostly talking about th culture surrounding admissions. If you’re not perfect in everything, then there’s no point in applying. The problem is that someone like you has the time to be “perfect.” Even I don’t have it bad; I have some time to do meaningful work and I just have to factor that into my daily routine. No big problem. There are others, though, that have entire families, 40+ hours of work a week, absolutely no financial help in anything.

"dxaxcnq","Seems like there is a lot going on here, just a few thoughts...

1. Your wife and her mother have an obviously damaged relationship. They clearly make an effort to passively hurt each other as an expression of the disfunction of their relationship. 

2. Your MIL getting you a gift that was so clearly much much more then she would do for her own daughter was meant as one of these deliberate attacks.  By giving it to you, she sent a message to her daughter. ""I am quite capable of being caring and generous, but not to you. Your wife's joy in this blender will be a reminder of that every day."" Make no mistake that your MIL knew exactly how much this would hurt your wife, and she intended to make you the vehicle of it. 

3. You seemed to know this was causing your wife pain. You also thought that this was a ""thoughtful"" gift. I ask you, what is thoughtful about giving you a gift that she knows will cause pain and strife within your relationship? It was not thoughtful, it was manipulative, and targeted to hurt. 

4. Your partners passive aggresive behavior is a direct result of the conflict she feels inside. She wants to smash that blender. More, she wants you to let go of your attachment to it, and be on her side. It is just a thing. she is your partner. You have known how much it hurt her, yet you made no steps to truly address that. What would it have meant to your wife if you saw her pain, talked it through with her, then sold the blender on craigs list or something, and you two bought a new one together? There are many ways you could have handled this better as well. 

5. You partners dog poop composting act was a way to get back at you since she feels unable to express the pain she keeps feeling at your joy in the blender, and your lack of understanding of the pain it causes you. 

So I would consider the following questions. What is more important to you, the blender or your partner? Given that you have been made an instrument of torture by your MIL towards your partner in using this blender, what do you think would be the responsible thing to do in resolving this? I know many people will say, ""It is just a blender, your partner should grow up!""  But remember that the ways in which parents and children hurt each other can be inventive, and it is not the item, but the intention behind it, and your lack of support and understanding that is triggering your partner. 

This is what I would do.... I would sit down and ask my partner if my using the blender has been hurting her? If she feels I have been insensitive to her issues with her mother? Does she believe that the blender was intended to cause this pain, and have I been unwittingly participating in that? What would help resolve this situation? Spend 20 to 30 minutes just asking her questions, trying to open up to what she is feeling. This will create a safe space for her to share, and potentially even face some of the things she may be in denial about. 

Your partner was overtly nasty with what she did. I think she was trying to resolve her pain with the blender, and her feeling of your lack of empathy. I think you were perhaps unintentionally cruel in thinking that you were innocent of causing any pain, or that the gift was truly innocently or kindly given. 

We always want to be right in these kind of painful situations, but the reality is it takes two to tango. the thing to remember is that this does not define either of you. The behaviors are just coping mechanisms that you have outgrown, and need to change. you have a choice in this.

This month we:

- Ordered my Fiance’s Kilt!

- Mostly finished wedding website. Some pages, like RSVPs, will go live after invites are sent. Minted is great. Got a $50 accoubt credit for buying the premium website!

- Sent Save the Dates with Paperless Post. 10/10 would recommend.  I used a free text design, changed fonts and colors to go with our wedding, skipped the expensive background. I really, really loved the tools for collecting addresses, for seeing who had opened the card, for fixing mistyped emails. The forward to me feature was also great, since my own mom unsubscribed from Paperless Post at some point in the past. Will give it three-four more days (it’s been a week) and I will use that to try again for the five people still showing as “unopened.” The only thing I would do different is put small text at the bottom of the card, “please click through to send us your mailing address” It asks guests for their address but only if they click to view the event on the paperless post site. But I had most of the mailing addresses from family so it was ok. 

- 99% Finalized our guest list. There are a few people we may still send a date to and a few we still don’t have email addresses for.

- Made make up artist appointment. This took some back and forth. I wondered for a day or two if the company didn’t want my business because I’m not paying a travel fee and I’m only having my makeup done. (Bridesmaids will do their own.) But they finally sent me an appointment time and the salon is 5 minutes from my venue. Could not be more convenient. I’m expecting some hassle in booking the trial so I’ll allow lots of time when I contact them for that. 

- Booked photographer for photo shoot with my dad, who is sick and may not be able to attend the wedding 

- Booked venue for after party. Was also a bit frustrating. They didn’t respond to email but we went there in person for dinner, saw the banquet room and they wrote us down in their large, paper scheduling book. No minimum. We can order pizzas and pitchers and people can order more food and drink if they like. 

- Sent silk flower inspiration to my Aunt who bought supplies and finished one boutineer already. Looks great! 

- Bought slip and bra for dress

- Contacted premarital counseling person, who is out for medical for a month but we’re on her radar now

- Made progress on DIY projects. Nothing is 100% finished, which is frustrating 


For April

- Photo shoot with my dad in my wedding dress. So excited for this. It’s hard because he has a chronic illness but this will be special, particularly if he can’t come or passes away before October

- Figute our photo booth

- Book honeymoon

- Figure our what FILs actually want to pay for and figure out rehersal dinner.  I actually love my FILs; they are awesome and generous. But they have been vague about helping financially with the wedding. Fiance would like to ask them together but with their work schedules we often see one or the other.

"dweecex","I will simply quote Vladimir Lenin, Socialism leads to Communism. To be frank as history tells us Socialism as Communism is the lead of most deaths in history of over 200 million, but hey to each their own. If I was to be realistic and truthful people are selfish and Socialism makes sure that can happen it justifies a lot of evil deeds, but people don't care. 

As for Capitalism it is flawed, yes, but at least people have a choice. You can chose to work and make something of yourself or don't, but you can't blame Capitalism due to poor decision making of individuals a lot of people expect free hands out and that isn't reality. People should have a inside desire to be independent and wanting to be truly free, which to be fair Capitalism offers that exactly, which neither Socialism or Communism does. Under both Socialism and Communism your life is decided by the state, which I disagree with you may like to live under that kind of rule, but I don't, but all the while the US has been pushing more towards Socialist policies people tend to confuse the two.

Welfare is a generous, but socialist policy and thanks to it people have become more dependent on the state, but which you are correct it has caused deaths, because the state is completely unreliable. 

Free healthcare provided by the state, which also causes many to be killed. Which in fact that same system took my Uncle life recently, but hey no one else cares as long as they get something handed to them on a silver platter, right? In fact it also took my many of my family members, but you will rather hate Capitalism under ignorance and rather have Socialism because of the hand outs which Socialism offers. 

I on the other hand would personally prefer to live under a true independent capitalistic society with anti-monopoly laws than any society most would suggest here. I believe in History and history is a strong teacher.

"dwdndb5","We would both like to comment.

Me (m/55) has been enjoying a committed relationship with a younger, beautiful woman. I am active physically, strenuous hiking, weights, and eat clean, healthy foods. That said, my S/O and I enjoy sex on a daily basis. On weekends, we commonly have sex 2-3x per day. I do not take any ED medication, however I do have a cocktail of amino acids daily, which has resulted in a noticeable improvement in my erection strength and stamina. My semen production has also increased BTW, resulting in my ability to produce multiple ropes of cum shots.

Me (f/40) has never been happier! my S/O is not only generous but very confident in bed (and anywhere else in our house LOL). He is not afraid to ask for what he wants but secure enough to ask me what excites me. Communication is key!!! my man is very, very attentive and thorough.

"dwcn4gy","The idea I was toying around with was instead of individual random cards for the first 30 wins of the day they would be wild cards.  30 cards in real life is the equivalent of 2 booster packs, so out of those 30 wild cards you would be guaranteed 22 common 6 uncommon and 2 rare/mythic. However there would always be the chance that any of those could be a higher rarity then what is guaranteed. 

On top of that there would be playset bonuses for wild card redemptions and pack pulls. Whenever you get the fourth copy of a card be it from redeeming wild cards or pulling from a pack you would get a wild card of that cards rarity. 

Now people may look at the other ccgs on the market and say that is way to generous but most of those other ccgs don’t have 250 cards per set.

"dw4bp9o","Sure thing.  Fair warning, its gives you a general idea of things, but it is more improv heavy than having everything pre-written.

Alright, I'm going to use a tactic a woman on YouTube taught me, the channel being [MonarchsFactory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJd6g--Ok_A).  That tactic's acronym is SPERM, and stands for Social, Political, Economic, Religious, and Military.  Using that, you can normally get the big buildings that would draw interaction leading to the town feeling alive.  So we'll go with those.  Social we could say is the tavern, The Blue Raven.  Political, Town Hall.  Economic, let's say its a fishing village that have docks which also include the market there.  Religious, I'll go with a sacred grove in the middle of town.  Military, I'll say they have a town barracks, also connected to the water, so they can have some basic waterway protection.  With that, we now have the workings to bullet point a town.

**Asterfang - Small Fishing Town**

*Blue Raven - small tavern in good repair among some trees, blue tiled roof, 5 rooms, 2 beds per room.  Owner is Letholdus Rowntree (Friar like hair due to balding, suspicious, not fond of outsiders, but jovial with familiarity).  

*Town Hall - large wooden building on top of a hill, has a large clock tower.  Mayor is Beatrix Redstream (long red hair, clumsy, very generous, but quick to anger if she thinks she is insulted).

*The Dockworks - open market that spreads out onto portions of the docks from the town, colorful stands, has a few large docks that spread outwards with many smaller portions branching off of them.  (Here would be a number of shop owners depending on what you'd want in the town, just be smart in some of the placements, for instance the blacksmith would likely be on the portion of the market found on land.  Aside from the shop owners, maybe a couple of notable NPC's like a dock master and well known fisherman of the town).

*The White Star - White lattice arches, perhaps Elven looking, surround a cluster of beautiful trees and flowers, the trees appearing to be stuck in fall colors despite whatever season is present.  Offerings placed at the base of trees.  Taken care of by Duraina Truegust (polite and respectful, obstinate, smells heavily of autumn leaves) among other priests.

*The Crimson Cloaks - Town guard barracks, only stone structure in the town, has a large watchtower.  Small sturdy building on the docks housing guard boats, guarded and locked.  (Here you could do a couple of things.  You should always have a captain at least, and if you want perhaps a couple of named guardsmen or have full on NPC's such as lieutenants).  Celaser Cromelon - Captain of the Guard (long wavy black hair, glamorous face, 3 piercings on her right ear, takes things at face value, highly variable mood, hates Dwarves).  Trailing guardsmen Gariad Oldbuck and Doran Bladewalker.

I typically try and have a basic description of a place along with one or two notable features.  With NPC's, I try and go with three notable features and a couple of general quirks.  Feel free to shorten or elongate that as you please.  With that though, you would have a very believable town with just a handful of notable locations and some NPC's to be there.  Past that, if you wanted some specific encounters they could bump into, I generally look at what some problems could be and why hasn't anyone solved those yet.  I'll go into a few super basic plot hooks that could spark entire interactions with the town or quests themselves.  I typically try and throw in three things going on, and if I have more, they tend to tie into the same location but just have a couple ways to get there.

*The tress in the White Star are wilting, but no one is sure why.  Happens to coincide with a strong wind coming in from the East that normally isn't there.

*Fisherman are afraid to go out on the river or lake because people aren't returning.  Guards perhaps don't believe the rumor, OR they have tried to help but keep losing men, so have given up looking into the problem.

*Have stopped getting trade boats from up the river, OR perhaps have stopped getting travelers in from a certain direction.  Too far for the town to check out, but maybe the player's could investigate and send word.  (I tend to avoid things like this to a point, but quests like these are really good for continuing to pull players toward a location you want them in.  Caravan escorts and such are in that category.)

*People in the town have been disappearing and the Captain has been keeping to herself since it began, rarely seen outside during the day.  This is just a rumor, but directly ties into missing people.  In this case, I had in mind she had became a vampire, was taking fisherman away while they were alone and helpless on the lake.  Fearing discovery, she keeps the guards from actually investigating it.  If the player's look into it, maybe they find some fresh corpses with fang marks in them.

Alright, so I feel like that is a lot more than you asked for, but that is kind of what I do to setup an area.  Already, there is a lot going on in this town that could happen, but if they simply travel through it, maybe that was 20 minutes of work and you don't feel like you worked for hours on an adventure.  Another thing I do is flowcharts which I find incredibly helpful.  Its kind of just doing cause and effect based on the goings on in the area.  Super quick example, maybe the fisherman don't want to loan out their boats, and they are a bit too expensive to flat out buy, so the PC's can either ask the guardsmen for one or try to steal one.  Based on that choice, the guards would react in one way or another.  Their orders would be to keep the boats in the boathouse, but if the players have a good argument and push for the greater good of the town, maybe they cave and let them take one.  If the players steal one, they have to be quiet about it, and of course there is risk upon discovery.  Hope that helps you out a bit, even if its a general example.",1521745739,"mayor is beatrix redstream (long red hair, clumsy, very generous, but quick to anger if she thinks she is insulted).","generous, but quick","generous","but",TRUE,"very generous , but quick","quick","very",NA,1

"dvqk36x","First of all, you are doing yourself no favours by being so negative. It’s easy to feel comfortable with the feeling of being depressed, because you’re used to it, but you’re throwing yourself into a downward spiral. I’m 26 and I was in the same boat as you. I think this is just the motions of transitioning into an adult to be honest. You are going through what most go through. Missed opportunities are a given, what ifs and maybes. Could have done this or that. Stop dwelling on the past, you are young! You could start a new life at the other side of the world if you wanted too. It is never too late.

Secondly, have you ever questioned why people don’t speak to you, or give you attention. The way you have worded it makes it sound like you are frustrated at other people. Don’t blame other people for your shortcomings. Nobody owes you anything. You are not special. The majority of people go through the feelings that you are going through right now. A quarter life crisis, existential crisis, whatever you want to call it. It’s a common thing. The people that overcome it are the people that are self-critical, and change. It’s about looking inwards. Life is a constant cycle of change, constantly reinventing yourself. Becoming a better version of you, day by day. That is what life is about, facing adversity and overcoming it. Do not focus on happiness as a goal, it is not a goal. It is a feeling. You will never find it at the end of the road. And try not to compare yourself to other peoples’ lives and accomplishments, everyone’s life seems perfect from a distance.

Now for the solution. Please understand that hitting rock bottom is the catalyst for change. The further down you are, the greater the change. This is the point, against all odds, with no hope in site, that metamorphosis takes place. It is a natural part of maturing; everybody goes through similar feelings at some point. I think it’s important to emphasise that.

The first piece of advice I have to give is to start sending out positive energy. In the past, when I felt like nobody liked me or wanted to talk to me, which has happened various times in my life, I went through a period of self reflection. Why do they not want to talk to me? What do I have to offer? You have to give people what they want. You don’t hang around with someone if they give you negative energy. I spent way to long playing the blame game. Have you ever noticed how the most popular people radiate positive energy? People feed off that. People also love to talk about themselves. Be a listener, be confident in you, and take genuine interest in people. People in turn will take interest back. You’ll feel good about people taking interest, and that’s the sort of positive cycle you want to get into. There’s only one direction from there and that’s up. So rule number 1:

1.	POSITIVITY = POSITIVITY

Read ‘How to make friends and influence people’ &amp; ‘The Secret’.

The second piece of advice I have, is to start acting today like the person you aspire to be. It may sound silly, but everyone has someone they admire, who they aspire to be. Whether you watch a movie and wish to be like the protagonist, or envy someone because they seem to breeze through life and have a knack for getting the girls, you need to emulate that person. If the main character gets up every morning and does pull ups, you do the same. Think of yourself as an actor taking on a role, if you do it for so long you will become that person. Fake it till you make it. So rule number 2:

2.	START ACTING LIKE THE PERSON YOU WANT TO BE – TODAY!

Finally I just want to say, none of this is overnight magic, it is about constant self-reflection and improvement and learning, don’t become stagnant. It’s about the small incremental changes, which seem insignificant on their own, but as a whole create great change. If you feel down, or have a bad week don’t worry, because remember that is when opportunity for great change happens. Be stoic, but sympathetic. Be kind, but strong.

"dv7edm8","&gt;Does anyone have any experience hooking up with strippers? Pros cons?

I dated one for roughly a year (she had been a stripper from 18 to 24, then quit two years, then had to start again and we met through a friend at around that time). Unsurprisingly, she had a fucked up childhood and tons of psychological issues. She was like a confused little girl looking for someone that would take care of her by providing a strong frame on which she could rest upon. As long as I was keeping frame (and trust me, tests never stopped), she was amazingly sweet and generous. But back then I was not that good at keeping frame and the results were terrible...

I consider her to be the relationship from which I learned the most, mostly because her combination of being extremely insecure and extremely smart when it came to men, made her a thermometer of my own behaviour. If I showed any bit of weakness, if there was any insecurity in my behaviour, if by my actions I was trying to cause dread and it was a bit too obvious, she'd tell me. At that time I didn't appreciate it, but looking back, it was really, really good experience to learn about women. This was all before I learned about the red pill.

I still maintain some faint contact with her and I know that she's managed to somehow redirect her life.

"dtili8u","My favorite roommate was a Chinese exchange student, but a few things she did bugged me.

- she mentored the Chinese freshman, which was great, except one morning I left the shower wrapped in my towel and went into our dorm room and there were three tiny Chinese freshmen who couldn’t speak English yet all staring at me. It took like five minutes to convince them to step into the hall so I could dress!
- she got a free beta fish and then never cleaned the little tank and just let it die in its own filth. It had seizures for a day when it went belly up. Looking back I think I should have adopted it but I was having a rough semester and hadn’t really realized she wasn’t caring for it at all.
- she cooked 90% of what she ate, which was fine, but the mess attracted mice into the suite, which was not fine.

My worst roommate had been a friend the previous year, but living together I realized she was a very negative, bitter, unforgiving person. It wasn’t just roommate stuff, it was petty issues with my other friends and some serious mental health things going on. I kept my feelings to myself and then exploded at her in public, and we never spoke to each other again. She moved out, and the RHD assured me I hadn’t been the problem, and I had a room to myself for a semester and a half. I regret how it went down, but I think it was inevitable.

Another roommate was really sweet and generous but she smelled bad. She was in the foster care system before college and just didn’t seem to know how to adult at all. She never ate real food, just junk and novelty Ramen crap. I think she skipped showers and doused in axe spray a lot? I had to ask her not to spray it in the room bc it was so overwhelming. And then she disappeared for days, then showed up and just...everything smelled. She smelled like she hadn’t showered in her life and I didn’t know what to say. finally I phrased the question as “hey, your laundry smells gross??” And she was like, “I don’t have any laundry” and was really embarrassed, and I had to be like “there is a really bad smell it’s really bad” and she told me she’d left campus for stomach surgery, and that’s why she was so out of it. I guess she didn’t want to get her stitches wet or she was in a lot of pain. But after I said something the smell eventually got better. 

my roommates were surprising but they were all better than more than half the crazy fuckers who lived in my suite over the years.

There was a freshman girl who brought creepy men into our suite that she’d met on Craigslist. They were all creepy and at least one of them was looking for stuff to steal, so the whole suite had to report her multiple times.

Then there was a girl who looked like a Miss America and faked being sweet so people loved her...but she was actually the incarnation of the devil. She yelled and screamed all the time, argued with her boyfriend, hit her boyfriend (I went to the RA about that), called me a fat loser bc I complained about the constant yelling. Her parents would visit on the weekend and would stand there with her door open, yelling and being rude too. She and her boyfriend ended up being on a security watchlist bc someone reported more domestic violence and I’m pretty sure they blamed me for that even though I had nothing to do with it.

I sing and play music. When I got bronchitis I couldn’t just quit, because that was a huge part of my grades and a part of my income. they would bang on the walls and mock me and it was absolutely humiliating and after a while I could barely even look at my guitar.

At the end of it, it was my last semester, I was intensely depressed and I gave no fucks. I got drunk with a friend who spilt some serious tea about that psycho, so I took vengeance and made sure the story spread around before I sobered up and rethought what I was doing. Turned out the story really was true, and although her behavior never improved I felt a whole lot better.

&gt;Since adult silkworms are rather fragile and have to be constantly kept at an ideal temperature, lest they perish,[8] they utilized their contacts in Sogdiana to smuggle out silkworm eggs or very young larvae instead, **which they hid within their bamboo canes.[1][5] Mulberry bushes, which are required for silkworms, were either given to the monks or already imported into the Byzantine Empire.**[1] All in all, it is estimated that the entire expedition lasted two years.[9]

"dswrpy4","Couple things. 

Your dog has great instincts, and only wants a polite meeting before moving forward into play, and it sounds like she can adopt different play styles once she's made an acquaintance. These are critical skills, and to preserve them don't think of this interaction at the park as a ""bad experience"" for her. Putting up with assholes is part of a dog's life, just like us. Avoid humanizing her reaction and treating the experience like a traumatic event. It's dog stuff. You'll best serve your dog by gathering her up and saying, ""Jeez, that dog was an asshole"" and moving as opposed to giving her the poor widdle baby foo-foo treatment.

Two, if your dog is making good choices, build her confidence by backing her play. When you pull two dogs apart each can conclude that they're being punished. When I take one or both of my dogs to the dog park, I live by two rules. One, shit happens. Whoever's ""fault"" it is, I go in knowing I may end up at the vet's office. Hasn't happened yet, but I stay mentally prepared, loosely. Two, my dog first. All other canine and human considerations are secondary. If my dog is being a dick, I tell him (nicely), but if he (or he, 2 males) is being excessively harassed, I will step in and I will put my hands on your dog. It's important to know canine body language, because a lot of dog talk looks pretty rough to us. Dogs don't ""almost bite"". Every move is intentional; every tilt of the head, every lip lick and tongue flick, ears, tail, it's all communication. They may be our companions, but dogs are true animals, and the same dog that can take a potato chip from your hand without breaking it can decide to bite, where to bite, how deep to bite and execute the bite in a quarter of a second. Faster than a human being can even process what has already happened. Having said that, if another dog crosses my generous but clear threshold I will intervene. I don't mean hitting or kicking (not yet anyway), but I'll get between and use hands and knees in a way that lets my dog know I have his back and it's the other dog who's being a tool. So far, the other owners I've dealt with are of the same mind, and I have no problem with them getting involved in the same way. I'll deal with an owner with an attitude *after* I deal with his dog, and let the chips fall where they may. Like I said, my dog first. If your dog is trying to fuck my dog in the ear and you're 100 feet away on your goddamn cell phone, I ain't waiting for you.

Dog parks are fun, for the most part, and while it's not the most important thing for your dog to go there and interact with other dogs, it does light up some synapses and release some seratonins that nothing else will... kind of like a hunting breed that actually gets to go hunting. Just know that dogs argue just like people, and in the dog world, as long as they're not bleeding, they're playing. The key to having a good time is having higher expectations of your dog's behavior than of the other dogs (and especially the people) you happen to cross paths with.  And don't be afraid to assert yourself and be your dog's advocate... no one else puts your dogs interests higher than you do.",1516345979,"having said that, if another dog crosses my generous but clear threshold i will intervene.","generous but clear","generous","but",FALSE,"generous but clear","clear",NA,NA,1

"dprjx47","You sound like you're willing to move.  Personally, if I were you I'd move to a state with better benefits. In my state, You would have healthcare which it sound like you really need.  I know without my high blood pressure pills, I'd be guaranteed to lose years off my life.

In my state,  You would have food stamps.  You qualify for low income housing too but I hear there is a long wait list for that so probably won't get it for years (which really doesn't matter since yous live in a van).

If I were you, I'd first google the states with the most government benefits.  Then I'd look into the details of those benefits and whether you qualify.  Then I'd go to the reddit subforums for the city/state you are thinking of living in and make sure you understand the process of getting those benefits.  My state is really generous but really slow and has wait lists for some of the benefits so you should be aware of that (the subredditors can tell you these kinds of flaws in your plan).

You'd probably have to be a resident of that state so I wouldn't buy a van until you do this research.  To become a resident, you would need to rent a room from someone for a while first.  You can get rooms for maybe $300 in some cities I think leaving you $400 to live off of which is enough barring healthcare.

If you still decide to buy a van, I'd really get a high top in your shoes.  Think you'll regret it otherwise.

Also, cheaprvliving youtube channel and website really is good for people in your shoes.

Good luck.

"dpinyxq","My in-laws are Chinese. Like, grew up in China Chinese. They're super kind and generous, but there are some beliefs they hold that boggle and sometimes frustrate me (American and Japanese upbringing).

- They once told me not to eat bananas because they can cause leg cramps. You read that right. CAUSE. I was so confused and had to clarify that I was hearing right, because as far as I know, bananas=potassium=less cramps. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ I guess in traditional Chinese medicine, too much starch and sugar can be cause for cramps? Which is how they explained it to me.

- They are graciously offering their ""back house"" for us to live in for reduced rent (in Hawaii a lot of properties are split up into a main house and a smaller studio/1bed/2bed smaller house that people often rent out). But the thing is, they don't think we should move before the baby gets here. They think I should move one month after. Reason being, I will be ""so tired"" if I move before I give birth (???). In Chinese superstition its just bad to move while pregnant because it disturbs the baby's energy. Not even supposed to move furniture around. I guess nobody has told them about the nesting period before you give birth and the pure exhaustion that comes afterwards. In my mind, I would feel so much more peaceful and prepared if I moved and got everything ready *before* the baby arrives.

1. We're just too stupid to know the full plan God has for his creations. (""God works in ways we do not understand"")
2. Goodness (and other stuff) also exists. Therefore, God exists. (which is the exact counterpoint to the argument that if suffering exists, God must not exist, which they tried to refute)
3.a. God created evil so that we would know him. Instead of just, you know, talking to us.
3.b. It's man's fault for listening to the devil--which, you know, God created--and using his free will to commit sin. (Which again, I understand, but why punish the children?)
3.c. Those children that are raped and murdered are rewarded when we go to heaven. (*If* heaven exists.) It's like giving someone $1,000,000 after being raped. It does not take the pain or horror away.

It's the *same* arguments. Putting ""logical"" in the title does not make it so.

I pose this logical question for you: One of the teachings of Catholicism is ""to go to heaven, you have to truly accept God into your heart."" Even murderers and rapists can go to heaven based on this. I've checked with nuns and priests and they all agree with it. 

Take this scenario: a boy of seven years old is kept locked up in a dog cage by his father and used as a sex slave on a regular basis and treated as little more than an animal (this case exists). Say the father, after he's sent to prison, etc. etc. truly and deeply repents, and for the rest of his life, acts as God would want him to. He becomes a true follower of God.

The Earldom of Scurland is a collection of clans north of Vulland, under the rule of a single Earl residing in the capital city, Tullen. The Scurlanders have made their home among the woods, highlands, and bogs in the north of the Antrian Isles. A proud and resilient people, the Scurlanders fought fiercely against the Vullanders' conquest and forced the Avesian Empire to abandon the invasion into their homeland after decades of unsuccessful attempts. But unlike their Leplander neighbors to the west, the Scurlanders were unable to stave off Ravling raids, leaving the Scurlanders cautious and warlike after centuries of conflict. The Scurlanders are not particularly known for the prowess in battle, but when attacked, resort to ambush and stealth tactics. Scurlanders society places great emphasis on the clan, with each clan possessing a distinct territory, clothing, and call. The clans of Scurland can be separated into two general groups, the Roan, living in large well-developed colonies of the central grasslands, and the Crannan, living more solitary lives in the forests. As a whole, the Scurlanders are thought of as a generous, but mischievous people. They are naturally curious and wary of strangers, but anxious to turn those strangers into allies. Scurlanders have a highly organized society and an extensive vocabulary, often having three or more words for every one of the Vullish speech. Scurlanders are wary of Humans and while they often are treated as pests, some Scurlanders share their resources with hungry Humans.

Rave: After ragequitting SA a while back I ended up meeting an SD IRL. He's been incredibly generous but more importantly, kind and respectful.

Maximum difficulty, experience x3(crafting and killing XP buffed), harvesting x5, platform options and x5, cave building, and most of the helpful settings turned on for the better playthrough. (Including diseases bruhaha lol)

No tamed or wild dino stat boots at all. Dino stamina consumption dropped to .8 to help with flyers. Breeding interval minimum since babies die easy to the state of the game. Imprint stats x2, maturity x2, .5 baby food consumption, allowed imprint for all.

Weight x5 since we have many small tribes and factions as well as solo builders. Food, water, crafting, fortitude x3 since its primitive+ and less options to work with as far as food preservation.

Titanosaur can be forcefed, supply drop x1.5, fishing loot x2. 

Everyone seems to like it but we do have an Rp theme with events, trading, a town with a chamber militant; so I assume the rates and effort have created a satisfied community.

As your supposition suggests, these actions taken against your friend were not necessarily illegal, but they ARE unethical.  Just to jar your thought process back to reality, here are some simple questions:  if the people you work with were to find out your political leanings; how do you think your work place dealings would change?

"dl8o7ln","&gt;My god, your power scaling is over the top. 

Not at all. It's very natural.
Kratos is at the top of the verse, especially when he unleashes the power of hope. Not to mention he has dynamic stats due to his rage, which the other characters don't. WoG confirms that Kratos is 'probably not beatable' by anyone in the Greek pantheon:
http://playola.co/p/2d099d
So as is usual with any verse, the top guy always gets access to a lot of powerscaling.  At least when it comes to physical/non-hax stuff. DMC is no different to that kind of treatment. 
Besides, there is WoG powerscaling included in that post as well in regards to the speed discussion. It's not just my own.
The Warriors of Zeus are confirmed lightspeed for short bursts with dash move they have. The Warriors can also meet with Pollux and Castor in the Oracle's chamber stage in multiplayer. Pollux and Castor act as a stage hazard that can easily kill the warriors if they aren't careful. So that is what the question originally stemmed from in regards to them compared to the warriors, and well, it turns out Pollux and Castor are faster than the warriors of zeus. Who again are lightspeed for short bursts. A speed that Dante is not remotely close to.
&gt;That gif you posted of the twins seemingly time slowing is due to a scripted button scene it's all over God of War games.

You are confused, but I'll take a bit of the blame for that. That gif's purpose is not to show Pollux and Castor using time slow/time stop in that moment. That happened throughout the fight. Pollux and Castor lay time fields all over the map that if you enter you will be slowed down, and then there's a scripted point in the fight where it goes into first person view for Kratos where he sees himself moving sluggishly, but when Pollux and Castor zip around and attacks him, he is still able to react and defend himself despite being slowed down. Its confirmed that Kratos fought through it with his speed and kept up with the twins regardless. That particular gif is to show Kratos' reflexes while fighting a guy who is faster than the Warriors of Zeus through his time manip speed. 
&gt;And if you want to go that route then I can say that Dante can dodge attacks that happen in Time Stops because Geryon used quicksilver on him. 

This is false. It is WoG confirmed that Kratos fought on even despite being in literal time stop and reacted. On the other hand Geryon used  time slow, not time stop. That's all quicksilver does.
The official description for Time-Lag under Quicksilver is:
""Send out a dimensional time-rift wave that slows down your enemies while giving you ultra-high speed. Also, while in Quicksilver mode, you will constantly consume DT energy.""
So again, it slows down time. Not stops time. And guess what, Dante did not resist it at all. Every time Geryon used his quicksilver power, Dante was slowed down to a fraction of his speed. He looked to move about 1/5th of his normal speed under the affects of quicksilver. The time slow also only lasts for literally around 3 seconds when Geryon uses it. Literally. That's it. It's over and done and he gets one attack in at best. Not to mention there was no scripted sequence/cutscene where it was used either. For all we know in canon Geryon never got to use it on Dante and was defeated before he had a chance. Or maybe he only used it a couple of times and got off a few attacks on Dante that weren't enough to win. Unless you get clarification from a dev or some other statement, it cannot be said how much it was used in battle or what exactly was the consequence/sequence of events when he did. Either way, it wouldn't be equivalent to the Pollux and Castor thing simply because the word 'time' is in common between them. Calling it a time stop and saying Dante resisted it is both false, going both by its description and how its effects in the fight and future use work out. It affected Dante the same way it affects enemies when he uses it afterward. Let's look at a video of the fight: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtnBtEE_7Pc&amp;t
A couple of examples at 3:10-3:13 &amp; 3:29-3:34.  Geryon uses quicksilver and Dante's speed is clearly slowed to a fraction of normal. 
He never resisted, the time lag worked exactly how it was supposed to. And those instances were super short as well as you can see.
Also, from :00-:28, we also Geryon's base speed is also not impressive. It runs over some slow, shuffling zombie-like mooks who are still able to somewhat react to it seeing as they were able to turn around to look at it before getting run over. That and when they fell over the bridge for a few meters Geryon is still running during that. The bridge is what, maybe 200 meters long? It didn't cross that distance all that quickly even though we have clearly measurable time. So even if Dante did dodge an attack under that time slow, it doesn't say much, seeing as Dante's base speed is far higher than Geryon's is. Pollux and Castor's speed were immensely better, on top of them being able to slow their opponent down. 
This isn't even the first time Kratos has moved through legitimate time stop either. In God of War 2 when he enters the palace of the fates in the spire, time is stopped there. A bell clapper is suspended in mid-air and won't move until Kratos restores time to the room. Kratos' movements were slowed down noticeably, but he could still move around. 
&gt;And you proved that Kratos does not have the regen at all to keep up with him. Which means that Kratos will eventually die from Dante. 

No, I said Kratos' regen (which he does have) is not as good as Dante's proportionately but that's pretty much the only physical advantage Dante has at all. Kratos' durability feats are far greater than Dante's and that will help him plenty. He tanked a volcanic eruption that sent him from Methana Volcano all the way across the Aegean sea to the island of Crete, and that same eruption sank the Island of Atlantis. Which is pretty large for an island and not even directly connected to the volcano (seperated by a couple of miles of sea). That makes the volcano's energy output insane, leagues above any eruption in historic times at least. Kratos got up without a scratch, not a drop of blood. And he was not as powerful then as he is at the end of GoW3. On the other hand, Dante's regen can be overloaded by someone on his strength level. As seen when Vergil beat him at the beginning of DMC3 and when he beat Vergil both at the end of DMC3 and when he beat him as Nelo Angelo in DMC1. 
Dante's best strength feat to date is slowing down the fist of an already deactivated Savior. Kratos halfway through GoW2 could push back Atlas' fingers, a guy who was holding up the Earth for almost 20 years by that point and half-way through GoW3 he can push back Cronos' entire arm. And Cronos is stated to be a physical peer to Atlas. Kratos growth rates are monstrous.
If Dante gets stabbed by a guy provably many orders of magnitude stronger than him, his regen is going to be taxed immediately. Not to mention that Kratos' weapons are stated to leech life force off whoever they cut and heal him further mid fight. That's what the green healing orbs Kratos can get from killing enemies are described as in the novel; life force. Dante's regen will not hold up under Kratos' onslaught, it would be a no-limits-fallacy to claim it would. And I'm going to let you in on a little known secret. While Dante can die. Kratos cannot die anymore. The reason he is still alive in the upcoming PS4 game is because he has been cursed to live forever no matter what he tries. 
https://venturebeat.com/2017/06/21/cory-barlog-paints-a-picture-of-a-kinder-gentler-god-of-war/
Cory hammered it home twice in that interview that Kratos is unkillable now. He said first: *""He realizes he’s cursed. He’s going to live forever. No matter what he does, he can’t frickin’ die. That’s part of the torture he has to endure.""* And then repeats it later: *""he's cursed. He's stuck. He'll walk the Earth forever. No matter what he does, he won't die.""* You saw him try to kill himself at the end of God of War 3, using his new found Power of Hope strength and then stabbing himself with the Blade of Olympus which had absorbed the power of a few Gods and Titans already by that point. And the post-credits scene show his body disappeared with a trail of blood. That's because he is still alive and failed to kill himself, so he left the scene.
What does Dante bring to this fight again? He has fast regen, but it can be taxed by someone on his strength level, and Kratos is immensely above Dante's strength level. He is very fast but only at best 3 or 4 digit mach levels being extremely generous, but even low mid-tier guys like the Champions of Zeus are short burst lightspeed. Literally. And they are powered by only a tiny fraction of Zeus' power. Dante is far slower than other people that Kratos has beaten. Hell, here is another description of Quicksilver when Dante gets it in DMC3: ""Time-controlling style in which the player can move at lightning quick speeds."" In other words he needed Quicksilver just to reach lightning level speed in DMC3. In DMC3 Dante needed quicksilver to see falling rocks move at crawl speeds, but in Ascension (just like Dmc3, that's Kratos' earliest game chronologically) Kratos can see falling rocks as momentarily frozen with no aid: https://gfycat.com/ClosedAccurateHerculesbeetle . Dante has a bunch of different styles/gimmicks, but Kratos' physical advantages are too high, he has a lot of hax as well, and Kratos is truly unkillable now as of God of War 3 whereas Dante CAN die. 
&gt;Not to mention that Royal Block will allow Dante to pretty much just send back all of Kratos attack.

This is gameplay mechanics mixed with no-limits fallacy. What is the most that was ever negated/deflected in a cutscene by Royal Guard? Doesn't matter, Kratos can kill Dante before he can attempt to time his strikes with Royal Guard. Or he can just pull his soul out.

"dl861fq","There is nothing against anyone saving money in socialism- there is just a limit to how much money can buy you.

After a certain point, i do believe it becomes immoral.
For example, i dont think anyone needs to earn more than 1 million a year. You can have everything you want in life with that kind of income, and there are people literally starving and working their asses off just to survive. So I do believe there is a maximum amount you should be able to save- but for most people it wouldnt make a difference. Its like a minimum wage- there should be a maximum wage as well.

So many problems in our society arise because people with infinite money are above the law, and can use their money to change the laws in their favor, allowing them to accrue even more money. This is ridiculous. 

When the playing field for everyone is levelled- ie, everyone has access to quality education, food, healthcare, housing- then it becomes a meritocracy. But a child of a billionaire has to do literally nothing to become a millionaire, even if a poor kid is smarter and works 10x as hard. Thats not fair., and its not right- there is more than enough wealth in the world to give all kids good opportunities. Give them the same opportunity, and if they take that opportunity and make more of it, good on them. They deserve it. 
But dont let people hoard absurd amounts of money- six people currently have more wealth than 50% of the world combined. That is the sickest thing ive ever heard. We think people who hoard hundreds of newspapers are mentally ill, even if they can never read them all, but we praise people who hoard hundreds of billions of dollars, even though they can never use it all.

The final ones we got look more like something that would be seen from the Empire, yes, so it fits more in the world that we've seen. But, why not use the suits to develop Insomnia? The heroes could be a team from an Insomnian kids show that all four watched; and then they could have recovered the Magitek suits and gotten them modified with that in mind. That said, the suits aren't too bad on their face, (they do feature some elements of the 2017 PR movie) but I still prefer the old designs; if only because they more have the feel of a Power Ranger / Super Sentai team. So the design isn't terrible, it just needed more more refining.

The suits in terms of gameplay are a lot of fun, though. There's something to be said to being invincible that is a lot of fun. Taking the colors that flash when Nocits tanks a hit and then combining with the Ragnarok's red warp? It's very pretty.

""Khaleesi of the Great Grass Sea"", huh? When was the last time you saw the Great Grass Sea? What's happening there right now?
 What's happening in Meereen, even, where she left a selfish mercenary in charge of their transition to democracy while the Harpy is almost certainly still plotting to regain control? ""Breaker of Chains"" indeed.

She collects accolades because they make her feel important, but she has awfully poor follow-through. She wants to be kind and generous, but neither necessarily make you a good ruler: conscientiousness and diligence do. When you rule, people rely on you. You have to be reliable. Dany is the most unreliable ruler we've yet seen on the show.

Someone mentioned how she could have sailed for Westeros long ago, but instead chose to stay in Meereen to help the former slaves live new lives. That seems like it means it'd make her a good ruler, but, a short ""recess"" ruling one land before you pull anchor and go try to rule another one doesn't make you a good ruler. Realizing where your place is, even if it isn't where you wanted it to be, and acting accordingly would've made her a good ruler. She created a duty for herself to the people of Slaver's Bay, and she chose to shirk that duty because she just kind of felt like it.

I think the contrast between her and Jon's attitude is what's making her look so bad lately. Jon is a genuinely good leader; he does it because realizes it's where he can do the most good, not because it tickles his fancy. He's willing to commit to the singular purpose of enriching the lives of his subjects over any ambitions he may have for more titles, more wealth, more prestige. 

He does have the whole ""I've seen the Apocalypse"" thing coloring his perceptions, but still, when you put him next to Dany, she really comes off as an entitled brat. Maybe because, down underneath all her titles and grace and poise, she is.

Gaucho (Spanish: [ˈɡautʃo]) or gaúcho (Portuguese: [ɡaˈuʃo]) is a word with several meanings. According to the Royal Spanish Academy's authoritative Dictionary, in its historical sense a gaucho was ""a mestizo who, in the 18th and 19th centuries, inhabited Argentina, Uruguay and Rio Grande do Sul in Brazil, was a migratory horseman, and adept in cattle work"" In Argentina and Uruguay today a gaucho is, according to the same source, simply ""A country person, experienced in traditional livestock farming"". Because historical gauchos were reputed to be brave, if unruly, the word is also applied metaphorically to mean ""Noble, brave and generous"", but also ""One who is skilful in subtle tricks, crafty"". In Portuguese the word gaúcho (note the accent) means ""An inhabitant of the plains of Rio Grande do Sul or the pampas of Argentina descended from European man and [Amer]Indian woman who devotes himself to lassoing and raising cattle and horses""; and in Brazil gaúcho has also acquired a metonymic signification, meaning anyone, even an urban dweller, who is a citizen of the State of Rio Grande do Sul.

"dk7n1cq","I try to think of disruptive and aggressive people as strong rancid scents. Not all black people stink, but its hard to realize that when you've got one bad white or black person smelling up the place. Same with white people. 

Now as a white person, you may believe that you enjoy being around white people more, but the truth is, as a white person, you find it easier to overlook the undesirable sects that are a part of our people. I speak of the red necks, the yuppies, the hippies, the EMOs, the skateboarders, the blah blah blah.

If you noticed, all I did was pick a trait and generalize. Not all red necks are undesirable. I find almost all of them to kind and generous, but in the same breath, there are the bigoted, racist, foul mouth, unhygienic ones that want to make me hate them all.

It isn't their color that I hate though, or their red neck upbringing. I don't like their bigotry, racism, foul language, or slovenly habits. If we moved on to Yuppies, I detest their elitist, pretentious air. It isn't their color. I can do this with every subset of white society. Why don't I just hate all white people then?

It's because as a white person, I know that my disdain for them isn't about color. It's their personality and life choices that I dislike.

You fear that you can't resist being prejudice any longer, only when you were listing all of the things you disliked about black people, not one of those things had to do with color. You don't like blacklivesmatter because they start riots and loot. You say your mother was mugged three times by black people. They start fights with you. They insult you. They blah blah blah. Remove the word black.

You mom was mugged by three people. Classmates bullied you. Activist started riots and looted. Noisy, rude people kicked your seats in the movie theater. Your classmates were rude to teachers and disruptive. 

Do you see?

When you can only use one adjective to describe a person, the problem stops being them and starts being you. You stopped thinking of them as human beings and started seeing them as a tribe or a group or a collective. You stopped seeing the individual and can only see the mob.

You've heard of mob mentality, right? That's where when you are part of a mob of people, you end up surrendering your sense of individualism. You lose yourself to the crowd. It's an illusion of freedom whereby you convince yourself that the liabilities for your decisions can be fostered off and shared by the whole crowd. It's like telling ourselves that it is bad to take a life, but as part of a nation, our mob mentality permits us to take lives under certain circumstances. As an individual, we still believe that its bad, but as part of the mob, we tell ourselves that we didn't do it. Someone else in the mob did, thereby alleviating our guilt over the act. Being part of a mob allows us to shift our blame to another despite the fact that we supported the action by being part of the mob.

From your position outside the mob, you blame everyone who is part of the mob for the actions of the individual. It is kind of a reverse mob mentality.

The easiest way to overcome your budding prejudices and racism is to come up with a different adjective with which to describe those who offend you. If you stop at just the word black or the word white you create the mob that you so disdain. You create the bleakness in your world, not them. The more generalized and vague the adjective, the larger the mob that you create. Use a more specific adjective, and you shrink the size of the mob so that it no longer encompasses your entire world. Smaller mobs can be avoided and overcome. Larger mobs can not.

Don't let a little laziness with your grammar ruin your world.",1500040277,"i find almost all of them to kind and generous, but in the same breath, there are the bigoted, racist, foul mouth, unhygienic ones that want to make me hate them all.","kind and generous","generous",NA,FALSE,"kind and generous","kind",NA,NA,0

"dj1p3wh","Honestly I've been a Paradox fan for quite awhile and I'm half way in between with all the complaints.

On pricing I do think increasing prices in some countries on games like Victoria 2 is just greedy and unnecessary and while I'm opposed to that, it doesn't directly effect me and therefore my main frustrations lie elsewhere.

On Crusader Kings 2 I think the DLC has been fine for the most part, I think having societies as a free feature was generous but nice. The recent DLC doesn't make me feel like I have to buy it in order to play the game and so I'm fine with it.

On EU4 I'm quite mad. The Common Sense DLC is truly infuriating. Paradox reworked the game so I had to buy the DLC if I wanted to spend my extra monarch points in a way to improve my nation (since buildings no longer costed points). While I do think Mandate of Heaven was a good DLC, despite not owning it myself, most of the recent DLC seems overpriced and a cash grab for the minimal content. Most things that are coming out in recent DLCs are reworks that really should be free generally. EU4 is a great game still but it's not approachable to anyone who doesn't already own it because much of the DLC is needed for a descent game.

On Hearts of Iron I'm frustrated but not too angry. First off for those saying it's dumbed down- it is. HOI3 was too confusing for me and that's coming from someone who has played almost all of the Paradox grand strategy games available. The game is pretty good now although the AI is admittedly quite easy to defeat for me in almost every situation. Paradox has been looking into ways to fix the AI while still making the game playable. I'm angry about the latest release however as it was simply not ready. The game was not play tested and I'm waiting for a hotfix to come out before I even play the game (I know I could revert). Leaders retiring is just insane and quite stupid bug. On the DLC, I get the complaints. Yeah a lot of the DLC is focus trees and to be honest that does suck. I always felt Paradox should have put more focus trees in the base game, especially for some nations like Spain. On the flip side, the latest DLC is only ten dollars so it's not too bad. I do like the fact that HOI is probably one of the best games to introduce friends to and the multiplayer support is pretty good. Last but not least the modding for the game is terrific. Kaiserreich (I'm probably spelling it wrong) is an absolutely amazing mod and for some of the game's best mods- I wish Paradox gave the developers something. 

In the end, Paradox has taken a wrong turn in some places. It's been alarming but I'm cautiously optimistic about what HOI4 will become and I will probably be judging them from there. Paradox as a whole has provided me this thousands of hours of entertainment and quite a bit of history knowledge. Paradox is a company trying to make money but at some point I hope they take more things into consideration and I remain hopeful, as I've seen progress from Paradox in their responses to feedback on HOI4, that the company is headed in the right direction.

"diph8kc","Thanks :) 
Freya is potentially the most wild female image, overtly sexual, is fierce and flighty and winds up leading the Valkyrie. She is still gentle and feminine, magical and compassionate, and has a unique relationship with Odin (in my interpretation and research as a lover and partner first in addition to Frigg, as a teacher of Vanir magics-
 especially Seidr, as a student and coworker) and retains a lot of independence in lore, even laying claim to half of all fallen warriors for her feilds Fólkvangr and hall Sessrúmnir. I suspect they have a slightly different focus than Valhalla even while war is still practiced by those spirits awaiting Ragnarok... considering Freya's interests and liberal proclivities. 

All that considered, Frigg the wife of Odin (and it's important to note that wife in ancient prechristian/non roman/greek/eastern context pretty much was a ceremonial title of rank, love, responsibility, and shared children) is usually more gentle, dutiful, and concerned with imagination and understanding of the future. 
She is perhaps the idealized form of gentle, generous, but authoritative feminine principle.

Frigg's handmaiden Eir (and also more likely more of an intimate companion and allegiant) is possibly the most gentle and compassionate of all the Aesir associated specifically with healing, medicine, mercy, and helpfulness. She cares for all especially to help Frigg and the Aesir.

Idunn (Youth), and Sif (Bounty) are also loving, compassionate and generous.

I hope this is helpful, and I'm quite happy to chat about it.

"dii6nyr","I had an idea for a dumb but wise character who wanted to be a wizard but could never hack it. He was a devout man who was kind and generous, but would pray for the intelligence to learn the magical arts. He was perhaps from a family of mages and simply had no affinity for magic but wanted nothing more.

A god, not necessarily the one he would pray to, heard his calls and chose him, seeing a powerful ally to spread his message who was wise enough to use the skills that he could be given for righteousness. This character would be a light cleric, given an affinity for fire to mesh the worlds of the arcane and radiant and build trust and understanding from within his family.

If I was DM and you convinced me of something where you had a reason for your character to abandon the path of life and follow the light I would be all for it, regardless of how powerful it was. That said I'd probably say that you are 100% locking your character into that path for the rest of his life/the campaign. You are a level 5 life cleric and that is where your life cleric abilities end. You are now also a level 6+ light cleric, and will only gain the abilities of the class as you move on from that point. No warding flare, no radiance of the dawn, no blessed healer, no divine strike. Your 5th class level spells are those from life, but your 7th and 9th you'd earn from light.

"dhkzu1i","&gt;We can't know definitively how much the doping influenced the outcomes but we do know Lance thought it was important enough to risk his entire career and legacy to do. That, in itself, probably tells us what Lance thinks about him winning those races without doping.
If Lance doesn't think he could have won them without cheating, why should we just ignore his cheating on the grounds that he was great while cheating?

This is a strong argument, and one that has occurred to me before, but I can't quite fully agree with it yet. I think it almost naively discounts the condition of the sport being rampant with drug use. I am speculating here and could be wrong, but I imagine a scenario like this -- young athlete realizes the sport's elite are almost exclusively using PEDs that no natural body could compete with, athlete decides he'd rather be a winner in the PED-league than a nobody who didn't take PEDs. Now morally, I agree we can hold that against athlete. But in terms of assessing his ability, should that count against him?

I.e., imagine that lifting weights was ""banned"" as training in the NFL. Nonetheless, many linebackers secretly lift weights to get stronger. Young player x realizes that even though it's banned, the whole freaking league is lifting weights, and he will never have a chance at being strong enough to compete unless he lifts too. Is that really wrong? Does that really invalidate his achievements? 

I think that is admittedly a bit generous, but analogous to what Lance did. Unless I am mistaken, he did not bring the culture of PEDs to cycling, he found it that way. So while we can indict him morally, in terms of athletic competition, I believe he still proved he was better than anyone else.

In most other time periods, rebalancing between equities and bonds ends up a drag on the overall portfolio return, rather than a bonus, since the majority of the time you're selling the good asset (stock) for more of the bad (bond), and only occasionally does the rebalancing work in your favor the other way.

"dh1iiyc","It started very early in childhood before knowing anything about politics or philosophy. 

I had a wonderful childhood with great parents who always kept a roof over my head and food in my belly.  I preface with that because what I'll say might sound cruel to some people, but it wasn't cruel at all.  **My parents always made it very clear to me that I was not entitled to a damn thing.**  Nothing.  That I had to earn things, and, yes, that earning things was hard. They were wonderful, and they did give me generous but modest gifts for birthday and Christmas, etc.  But when I wanted cooler basketball shoes during back-to-school shopping, my parents made me pay for at least half.  Even for necessities like shoes, they made it clear to me that I wasn't entitled to the luxurious cool stuff like the other kids.  Yes, that was technically unfair, especially because my parents could've afforded to get me the nicer shoes . . . but simple experiences and lessons like that throughout childhood very much impacted my worldview.

I think one of the main distinctions between conservatives and leftists is that first principle in worldview.  Leftists start with absolute utopian equality, so whenever they see something unfair, they go apeshit.  To them, there is always something or someone to blame for their hardships, because, after all, we're all perfectly equal, right?  They refuse to acknowledge that people are indeed different, with different talents, gifts, and (gasp) weaknesses that contribute to our individual successes and failures.  

On the other hand, conservatives acknowledge first of all that life is inherently hard and unfair, and they try to make themselves and the world a better place despite those challenges, and they don't blame their challenges on someone or something else.  For example, my grandpa could've complained how disadvantaged he was growing up in a ""redneck"" family in Wyoming, and how he'd never amount to anything because he wasn't born into a billionaire family.  His starting status in life was, after all, a product of ""the system,"" of some nefarious conspiracy to keep him oppressed, right?  He instead chose to accept his ""unfair"" starting place in his life and career--a hard labor lumber yard--and to make the best of it.  He went on to become a national executive later.  Learning about how my grandpa started out with nothing, accepting that unfairness, and making himself better despite it hugely impacted my worldview.

As I've aged, my observations continued to reinforce a conservative worldview.  American history and the development of early American political philosophy. Limited government.  Unintended consequences of government intrusion.  Free-market economics, etc.  

As early as possible, though, I think those early experiences in life made me conservative.  Without even knowing how to ""label"" my worldview, I've always been ""conservative.""

"dgcyg88","In terms of Arena, it is a game of skill and has nothing to do with wallet size, what are you talking about? Before I go on, I'm already confused why you think I am defending Blizzard, if you check my history, I am pretty anti-Blizzard, at least when it comes to the finance team that sets prices.

Assuming that 100g per pack is an okay price, most people don't have an issue with it, what people want changed is the value inside the packs or the actual money cost lowered. Assuming that is acceptable, I think 150g for an Arena run is also acceptable when you factor in the rewards you get.

Win about 4 games and you get your pack, your 50 extra gold back and a bonus of either gold, dust, card or an extra pack even. And the rewards just get better as you go up, and it requires skill to climb. I have no idea what your complaint here is. If it's the price per arena run in terms of real money, that is so people who are too good at the game and go 7+ wins don't get absolutely ridiculous value out of it.

The only thing I really want changed with Arena, is to allow us to challenge friends to Arena games. I would also settle for a free arena with NO rewards in it. I doubt the latter would ever happen since it will cost them money from some people just playing that instead of normal arena though.

"df58rwl","I am sorry if my opinion came across as generalizing too much. I don't think anyone can neatly fall into category A or B. I used to, regrettably, post rebuttals out of anger at the seemingly brokenness of this subreddit. I used to generalize expats as all losers who couldn't get jobs at home and have come to exploit China so they don't deserve to bitch about it. The more I think about it, however, I think that is the wrong approach. My dad taught me once no one chooses to leave their own country and home without thinking it will make them better. This applies to refugees, immigrants, and even expats. I think people on this subreddit are not all negative people, they are just regular people who are often perceived as negative. Our viewpoints are not stagnant, it is fluid like and constantly being shaped by circumstance and environment. If that environment, however, is toxic, it is then hard for ones thoughts to not be poisoned by it. I like visiting China, I think the country is beautiful and the people are often kind and generous. But for every story I can tell of sharing yak milk with Tibetans in a tent, I can think of 10 other stories of my wife being pushed down trying to get onto a bus in JiuZhaiGou, of seeing a man slap his wife and kick her in broad day light with no one stepping in to help, and of my relatives bashing other nations just because they did something to provoke anger. If you are Chinese and you live in China, you are born and marinated in this stew. Either you leave and go to another country and hopefully become better for it or you remain and have your thoughts shaped and moulded by this society. However, as an expat, you have no option. You will never become Chinese nor will you be treated like one. You will always be the Lao Wai who doesn't understand China.

He is something different, I think its reasonable to not see him trough a Christian lense. For all we know of religions in the Witcher universe, there are some dominating ones, but for the most part the world is polyreligious and polytheistic, although there are Cults like the Eternal Fire and Lebioda or Melitele, I'd say there is no real equivalent to Christianity or Islam in that world, so that there is also no real equivalent to Satan.  
&gt;Plus, his whole persona is that of a charismatic trickster much like Lucifer is in many stories. 

The trickster however is among the oldest figures in probably every religion. I don't know of any religion that does not have a trickster character, [even in the most ancient faiths, the trickster is present](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cagn). Think more of Loki than Satan.
Think of how the Greek gods are both very kind and generous, but also very cruel, random and arrogant. If we want to sort Gaunter O'Dim into a context, then a pagan context is the most likely, not a monotheist or dualist cosmology. Gaunter is neither good or bad, he is an integral part of the world, doing what his calling may be. The Crones are also very cruel and are nonetheless venerated as generous beings. Then there is another thing, about that he is not all-powerful, you can ask him about Ciri and he doesn't know where she is, it is out of his dominion. Same could be the question whether he is more dangerous than lets say Eredin. Well Eredin is a conqueror, arguably objectively weaker than O'Dimm, but O'Dimm simply has no desire or no place to conquer, his is not the role of the conqueror.

1) Honesty: Grey: You should never lie about your height and weight within reason - but too much truth - thats something that is for discovery in person. Telling all of your truths in a profile can turn a lot of people off and narrow out new matches out of your comfort zone because you want to be up front and honest. A good example: Someone wants to only date someone they perceived to be White. They are honest. The person they could fall for is White with an adopted black sibling. I guess it's for the best! You were honest! You were sparing the feelings of someone not white you are never going to meet who probably would send you a message anyway.

2)Be generous but concise.: Good: This is excellent. Could be more in depth though for those who have no idea how to express themselves in words.

"ddbtjmq","These are good questions, and I might simply ask, what is you're hoping to achieve? I don't mean abstract words like enlightenment, but more grounded. Are you trying to escape pain? Are you hoping to get rid of the problems of being human?

So first off, Jung is a bit dated on the Kundalini stuff. He's got an inherent conservative tendency to see the world from gender, ethnic and east-west divisions. His philosophy is always open and generous, but it still hasn't really caught up to today's mix of reality. The East and West have long since blurred their divisions. The middle class in India are more Western in some ways than the New Age groups in Southern California. So, careful with Jung's comments about yoga not being for Westerners.

Having said all of that, yogas of all sorts are in essence on the same gnostic path of knowledge that Jung was on, particularly the Jung in the Red Book. You'll see echoes in Kabbalah, Taoism. All of it starts to echo each other at the highest levels. Individuation becomes a joining of opposite energies (whether it be ego-shadow, conscious-unconscious, masculine-feminine, etc.), and climbing up the ladder of wisdom. Every joining of disparate energies produces a new whole. The whole eventually breaks into disparate parts, and will rejoin at a higher level. This is the dissolving and the coagulating Jung talked about in his alchemical works.

So back to Kundalini yoga. Are there cautions? Of course. Your ego thinks it's setting out on a journey to improve, but all of this gnostic wisdom does bring you very near eliminating what you think of as yourself. All of it, even Jungian analysis, can unleash really powerful energies. 

So, does your yoga instructor know what the heck they're doing? Just because it's been a joy for them doesn't necessarily mean it wont be hell for you. Can you do it carefully, and back off when you need to? Probably if you can avoid the temptation to push too hard. This is probably one reason why a very experienced teacher is important.

One book worth reading is Kundalini by Gopi Krishna, who has perhaps one of the biggest awakenings recorded, and it will give you an idea perhaps of what the downside is to kundalini.

"dajhti7","My boyfriend and I are IT nerds and we both have ADHD and grew up in conservative families where feelings were rarely discussed and sex certainly wasn't discussed at all. This creates the perfect storm for never addressing any problems until shit just blows up. 

Luckily neither of us want this to happen so we both have had to make a big effort to communicate. One of the ways we have found works best is letters. They don't take the place of discussion, but it's how we start discussions. One of us writes to the other, the receiver of the letter has a chance to read and process (very important for ADHD nerds) and then we talk. 

Writing it down and handing it over forces the issue to be addressed. We don't let each other off the hook and it is easier for both of us to have some time to think. We usually do the discussion portion during our relax time at home, I like to get in sweats and get cozy on the couch together. 

We keep our letters brief - it's a starting point. When I write to him, I always start by telling him how much I love him and that I want us to be our best. However you choose to talk to him, here's the formula I generally go by:

1. Tell him you love him
2. Make sure the problem you're trying to address is actually the one you're upset about. In my previous marriage I picked on the cleanliness of the house and his lack of wanting to go out, what I was really angry about was that he made no effort to make me feel loved.
3. Keep it focused on you and be vulnerable. *I miss the connection that I used to feel with you during sex* reads totally differently than *I'm unhappy with your foreplay routine*.
4. Tell him what you need.
5. Listen to him and find out what he needs too. Sometimes we feel like we're being so attentive and generous, but the other person sometimes needs something totally different. My ex husband thought he was being nice when he would buy little gifts, but everything he thought was great and awesome was just expensive clutter to me that stressed me out. I needed him to give me the gift of his time, to help me keep the home clean and orderly so I could relax. I couldn't give two shits about flowers or trinkets but I sure could have used someone to pick up the dog from the vet or to go deal with our foster daughter's school stuff once in a while!

However I have to say that there *are* guys who give gifts on the m&amp;g. I would say 90% of the guys who I ask for travel compensation in the amount of $30-40 give me $100-200.

"d86plm7","Your dad pretty much nailed it.  Period.

Expanding some though ...

MCs (main characters) should have a relevant bio worked out.  Everything your dad said.  You need to know what makes them them (not a typo).  Where are they from, what major events have shaped their lives?  Are they impatient or calm?  Bold or shy?  Vanilla or chocolate?

The trick is not to write down every single little thing about the MCs ahead of time in your notes.  What you're doing is building them so that when you ask yourself that **all important question while writing**, ""what would (this character) do / say / think now?"", they can answer you.  Enough needs to have been built so that answer can be given and make sense within the context of the character.  If it doesn't, if it can't, then flesh the bio more.

I built an apocalypse story and featured a suburban mom as one of my protagonists.  I knew where she was born, who she'd married, what she did, her personality.  When the apocalypse started, she was hesitant and terrified.  Violence, guns?  Monsters?  Run, scream, hide.  Be scared of the gun just as much as of the monsters.  She was nice and generous, but now that the world was falling apart, all she cared about was saving her daughter.  Before she'd do a lot to help people, tolerate a lot from them.  Afterwards, she just wanted to survive and was willing to walk away from people begging for help no matter how sorry she felt for them.

Another of the protagonists was (more of) a stereotypical veteran military guy.  Same book, same circumstances.  He called up an old friend of his who was still in the service and volunteered, almost begged, to attach to his unit and dive into the middle of a major city when everyone else was trying to get out as fast as they could, because he was the guy who'd die trying to help.

I've written other books that follow that one, sequels.  In them, minor characters that were literally just extras in the first have evolved into MCs because they became more and more important to the ongoing story.  As they grew, I built more things about them that I knew so I could write them properly.  The sketch bio became meatier out of necessity.  Before I just needed a general idea of who they were; but later I needed to expand it to know where they'd been, what they'd done, who they were.

Start with your MCs, follow the basics, build structure and character arcs, fill the roles with extras (because that's what the other characters are; *extras*), and see what happens.  When some of those extras become important, you expand them and keep writing.  That's how it works.

I will say that supporting extras, those that get lines any more complicated than pure reaction stuff like ""run"" ""oh my god"" ""come on"" ""that'll be $7.42 please"" and so on, those I usually come up with a paragraph or so of sketch bio for them.  I'll add to it as I write, as things come up.

For example, one ""extra"" that evolved into a more major supporting character started out as ""National Guard Soldier, artillery MOS.""  As I wrote, she turned into a coffee and cigarette addict.  She was irritable and irreverent.  She took zero shit off anyone, even ranking superiors.  As I wrote, I added notes to her bio.

I had one story where a reader asked me ""why is this (named an extra in a story) such an asshole; it's kind of funny.""  That extra was just a name, gender, age, when I cast him.  The moment the MC met him, he just abruptly became an asshole.  He was sort of helpful and wasn't a jerk or anything, he was just an ass about things as he played his part.

It's just how it works.  You build up the MCs, plan them, settle out how you want them to work and make sure their personalities and backgrounds and details match with what you want; and the others can just grow organically during the writing process.",1475143366,"she was nice and generous, but now that the world was falling apart, all she cared about was saving her daughter.","nice and generous","generous",NA,FALSE,"nice and generous","nice",NA,NA,0

"d7s4lym","Stannis is a sore looser whose bad attitude makes others want him to loose. Even his brothers tried their entire lives to get away from him. This bred an even deeper resentment in him, which festered into a veritable hatred for almost everybody who isn't himself. He's downright unpleasant. This makes him bad at forging alliances, bad at persuasion, and bad at sitting in judgment. Nobody can take him seriously and he takes himself too seriously. This psychological mess makes him ripe for the picking when a religious fundamentalist with dark magic fixates on him as Azor Ahai. Stannis resists her influence at first, but slowly as the pressures of being so hate-able mount, he gives in almost entirely to her influence. He even is willing to execute his nephew for her. 

Stannis has delusions of grandeur, no proven history as a ruler (only a competent admiral), and has proven to be very easily influenced by literal insanity. That's what GRRM wrote.

Amongst the unwashed masses, there is a persistent epidemic of lexical ignorance. Throughout the English-speaking world, millions of innocent people go about their daily lives without the slightest notion of the true nature of sport; they, in their generous but ignorant way, bless many an activity with the title of ""sport,"" but they, sadly, are often mistaken. However, there is hope for you, O neophytes; I am here to enlighten you. Thus, I present the Rigorous Definition of a Sport:

A sport is any activity in which all of the following take place:

1. An individual playing session is held between exactly two opposing players or teams. 

2. The successful completion of a playing session results in a win for one player or team and a loss for the other or a tie between the two players or teams. 

3. An integer score is assigned to each team corresponding directly to the number of times certain predetermined actions are performed by that team. The only judgment by any official regarding the score is whether these actions were performed. The winner of the playing session is determined by the final score. 

4. The players regularly engage in rapid, self-propelled locomotion. Examples include, but are not limited to, running, skating, and swimming. 

5. The duration of the game is limited either by time or by the completion of a preselected number of play units, the scope of which is determined by the completion of certain events during play. 

6. The objective of the activity does not at any time directly involve physically harming an opponent. 

7. The status of a solid inanimate object, movable by the force of one player, is of central importance when play is active. Furthermore, when play is active, the object is not physically attached to any player; and it is not rendered motionless, held, or contained by any player for an extended period of time. 

8. No live animals, other than humans, are used.",1473137808,"throughout the english-speaking world, millions of innocent people go about their daily lives without the slightest notion of the true nature of sport; they, in their generous but ignorant way, bless many an activity with the title of ""sport,"" but they, sadly, are often mistaken.","generous but ignorant","generous","but",FALSE,"generous but ignorant","ignorant",NA,NA,1

"d6bux7a","I don't wish to give any specific details because these people weren't malicious, in fact I would say there were exceptionally kind and generous. But in general, the wealthy have tools available to them to game the system and they use them. They can lobby for laws and government benefits to themselves. Not just nationally but at the state and local level too. And they can be completely out of touch of the reality of the working class. They don't ask ""what is best for all stakeholders"" (e.g., owners, workers, the community, etc) they only ask ""what is best for the stockholders"". I'm convinced that a ""stock holder"" economy vs. a ""stake holder"" economy is doomed to fail eventually.

All the stuff you hear about poor people gaming the welfare system? Well that is small potatoes compared to the sophisticated efforts of the wealthy in milking the public purse for all its worth.

Unchecked conservative economic policies would eventually lead us back to feudalism or something like it.

Unchecked liberal economic policy would result in equally bad outcomes in the other direction.

"d5pis2o","This is my first year VIB and the points are meaningless. I assumed there was something to look forward to but nah. So my spending with Sephora is way down these days. 

Every time I check out ways to redeem points, I want to snooze. Guess it's good I don't know what the fiasco last year was or I'd be  angry. Snoozing on the brand is better ;) 

It's a joke that if a VIB checks their emails after a few hours or isn't in the early batch (big email sends are batched and don't hit all recipients equally) then the latest special ____, let's go with the recent YSL lipstick reward, is already unavailable the instant you hear about it and try to shop. 

When Sephora advertises first access, it's not true. What they do is promise a brand like YSL that they'll only give out so many. YSL gets great advertising, and their downside cost of free product is limited since Sephora only gives out a small amount that YSL determined in advance. YSL's interests are protected, Sephora's VIB customers aren't. I guess it's a ""treat"" even if only a small % of VIB have access in Sephora's mind. Nice.... 

Sephora sends the email to all VIB to make it look like they're generous but naw. Sephora thinks it looks good for teaming with YSL, a high end luxury brand. YSL likes the advertising to Sephora's more pricey customers and meanwhile doesn't have to guarantee product for them (seems like Sephora has no negotiating power), and Sephora continuously misses the realization that they're burning bridges with high-value customers.  

I skipped a $120 tom ford purchase I'd been planning after I saw that last month and haven't shopped Sephora since. 

Brands: Offer a promise you can keep. Don't bait and switch. Don't offer a point system I think will be fun that turns out to have a ""15% of the time"" promise. Just offer free shipping (think Amazon) and I'll understand the terms and I'll keep shopping with you cos no resentment. Create a brand promise you can live with.

"d5bdgxe","For 4. I hate to break it to you but Denna all but tells us she is a 'whore' or, if you want to be generous but still pejorative, a 'gold-digger'. Personally I wouldn't use those words though and pick something more neutral like 'escort', 'prositute' or the generic 'sex worker' or maybe coin a new term like 'professional companion'. But Denna is way more complex than that. I love her relationship with Kvothe and the ebb and flow of it and how similar they are, how much insight they show into one another yet how little they understand (or rather empathise, especially Kvothe) with one another. Some people are very biased against women, especially those who might be sex workers. I wouldn't put any stock in it.

For 1. Repetition a basic and fudemental feature of story-telling. Dramatic effect is also part of story-teller so I do not understand that. Kvothe himself likes to cast himself as unique and someone no-one can truly relate with. Meanwhile he refuses to reveal the secrets of his heart to anyone, even Denna, while he steals peaks at their's. I can totally see Kvothe, especially if it is young Kvothe speaking, not getting that other people's empathy is capable of much more than he ever gives it credit for. Hence using that phrase. That said, too much repetition can grate. But the fact you were able to reread the books several times before it began to grate (or it didn't grate enough to stop you enjoying the rereading) suggests he didn't get this entirely wrong persay.

The rest is fair game. I think they represent stylistic choices to an extent and Rothfuss is the kind of author who will obesses for months on how to get a single passage right but he still has to finish a book. Hence inconsistency in the writing. Most stories, especially of this length, are not consistent all the way through after all. But I totally get feeling the entire work suffers for the excessive attention lavished on some parts of it. But then no story is consistent. It's just not possible. Why would a story about stories be something stories are not? :P

As for the Wise Man's Fear. I've only read it 1 and 1/2 times so far. I'm sure the flaws will start popping around 5. Then again maybe not. I mean the Dark Elf Trilogy (one of my absolute favorite books growing up: I had them in one complete edition) is undoubtedly a flawed work. But I read that book so much it fell apart in my hands one day (and the pages were coming out before then). I read and read and read and to this day I could not list a single flaw in it.

I didn't have the emotional maturity or self-awareness at the time to understand that I was angry at my father for abandoning me and for turning a blind eye to the abuse I was receiving from my stepmother.  Instead, I adored my father and was constantly hoping that he would pay attention to me and spend time with me like he used to.
And I took all my anger out on my mother and stepfather because they were there and they tolerated it.  It was a terrible way for me to behave and I feel horribly guilty about it now.  But at the time, it was the only way that I could process the hurt and the anger.

"d4p7x13","I think ultimately Basic Income will be real, necessary and generous. But the transition is very likely to be hell, because we have so many people who think the way the people cited by the OP do.

The basic problem, I think, is a failure of the imagination, not lack of empathy. Despite the fact that we live in a society where technological change occurs constantly, most people can't see the approach of automation that will do all the things human beings now do to stay fed, clothed, sheltered, etc.

I think a LOT of eyes will be forced wide open when self-driving trucks make 3 million truck drivers obsolete. Along with taxi drivers, Uber drivers, Lyft drivers ... basically, ALL drivers. About the only thing the Republicans and Dem centrists who control our government have in mind for helping these guys is training them to program computers. (To be fair, they probably don't personally know many truck drivers.)  

Honestly, I think corporations will catch on to the issues of technological unemployment a LOT faster than your average citizen will. Because unemployed people don't buy a lot of things outside food and shelter ... those who are fortunate enough to be able to afford those things.

So when people start getting poor because they're unemployed in numbers large enough to affect corporate bottom lines, THEN you're going to hear some howling to help our poor citizenry ... from the rich, which is the only segment of the populace that Congress listens to.

And the corporatists aren't going to want citizens stringing along on $12K a year ... they're going to want citizens who can afford to BUY THEIR STUFF! So they'll press for a very high Basic Income, or more likely, some form of welfare targeted at the unemployed, which will eventually become Basic Income ... I mean, they don't want their workers having too much money and not needing to work for them.

That's how I see it playing out, anyway. Fuck the poor and the unemployed, but when the corporations start screaming, things happen.

The first half of the class was fine, as it was more conceptual and he's better at teaching that. The second half of the class was harder to follow and he tended to read from the slides rather than explaining the material. 

The textbook is one of the best I've used at Davis. Read it religiously and the quizzes won't be hard at all. This is really the best way to stay on top of the class. He suggests pages to read as part of the class schedule. Fair warning: the PDF of the textbook that floats around is missing a small number of pages, scattered throughout the book. 

His midterms are tricky, especially the multiple choice. Read the questions very carefully. Some of the questions might seem unfair, but the majority of it will be reading comprehension if you know the reading material. His equation sheet is generous but unorganized. Take a look at it before the test. 

Woodall is notoriously a bit hard of sight and a bit hard of hearing. You'll have to shout to ask questions, and there will most likely be some cheating in the quizzes.

"d4hbj3p","&gt;First of all, when a murder happens, the police can't randomly arrest someone. Innocent until proven guilty. I needn't prove my innocence. The police must prove my guilt. The same goes for this scenario. When I say animal sacrifice is evil, which it is, I don't understand why people might be asking me for proof. You're the one who's murdering innocent animals, so you must prove to me why what you're doing is right.

This is circular. You're saying that ""killing animals is wrong"" requires no proof because it is wrong.

&gt;Some asked if I was a vegetarian or not. Now, I'm not a vegetarian yet, but soon will be, I'm almost there actually. But that isn't the main point at all. I was concentrating on sacrificing animals in the name of god. It makes the RELIGION evil. Nobody should follow a religion that demands life.

Why not? Seems like a small price to pay to honor the Gods and ancestors. 

&gt;If god demands lives as sacrifices, does that not make god evil? Of course it does.

How does that follow? It's okay to sacrifice the lives of animals to build a parking lot, or a soybean farm for your veggie burgers, but it's somehow *not* okay to sacrifice to the gods? That seems like a rather glaring contradiction. Our entire society is predicated on the destruction of nature and its denizens for the most trivial of human conveniences. You would probably think nothing of bulldozing a forest and everything that lives there to build a server farm to support the silliest forms of electronic entertainment -- and yet you would probably consider directly killing a single animal for religious reasons to be barbaric.

&gt;First of all, why would god create life only to ask for it to be sacrificed in his/her name?

One wouldn't. In the European tradition, at least, the sacrificial animals were domesticated. God didn't create them. Men did. At least that's how they thought of it. By honoring the god by sacrificing something you raised yourself, you demonstrate respect and generosity.

&gt;Isn't god ""ALL LOVING, ALL FORGIVING?""

No. The gods are capricious, jealous, vengeful. They can also be just, merciful, and generous. But they are not ""all"" anything.

&gt;God only seems to demand animal lives as sacrifices. 

No, plenty of cultures also demand human sacrifices.

&gt;What makes humans superior to animals?

Many belief systems would say that we are descended from the Gods in a way that animals are not. Our right is one of kinship, if nothing else.

"d3ntvxd","Hi,

Your specific issue based on a quick survey of a few posts is textbook passive aggressiveness. 

This basically means you do things that are aggressive while maintaining plausible deniability, and then you frame the issue as the other persons.

You will be able to go for as many years as you like not recognizing the hostility in your tone. No one will ever, ever take away your ability to argue that your stated intent is all that should count, and that if someone is offended, that has nothing to do with your tone. 

If a majority of a given group or community rallies around a version of reality they all are experiencing in which, consensus is, you're being passive aggressive, and then they tell you so, then you still need not worry. No one will ever be able to take away from you the cognitive capacity to believe that there is something in common across that entire group that makes their somewhat unified view completely anecdotal. Ignore that group. It is possible that there is something dysfunctional about them that you've literally never run into elsewhere. No one will ever be able to take any of this away from you. 

But it is my own anecdotal experience that folks stuck in the trap of their own passive aggressiveness end up isolating themselves bit by bit. And as a generalization, where they have love and value to add for others, sometimes habitual tones of passive aggressiveness end up as extraneous, unnecessary cognitive load for the people in conversation. More noise, less signal. 

From the outside it can start to feel either frustrating or angering. Most people are capable of coming back hard. I have a mean streak. I make an effort to not draw on it. I don't do Facebook and Twitter for a reason. I don't do Reddit much for a reason. 

The hard work for a lot of people I think is being vulnerable enough to communicate in a way that leaves the possibility of being criticiZed on the table. That is the way that is the most potentially valuable and generous but it's the scariest too because we are in a system of insults and hurt. 

I don't know you but my experience says that even though I think you are being passive aggressive, you're probably just another highly valuable highly capable loving and loved human. But I used to be passive aggressive all the time online so I know that it's hard to get out of. Admittedly I had the excuse of leaving a religion and feeling like I had no clear foundation to stand on in thT time period. Point is, my passive aggression was all about keeping my defensive posture while swinging here and there. I actually just wanted to connect but was too afraid to. Took me 6 years later to realize that though, which is one reason I probably will try to steer clear of your posts for a while--just because I'm too damaged a soul these days to handle the world of possible criticism I could get from you on a future post.  Online postings like Reddit terrify me for this reason. I'm here by mental necessity tonight and lately.

"d3faifc","Great week. I spent time in the wistful world of Jacques Tati, watched some uproarious screwball comedies and had fun with Mel Gibson getting angry. As always, I'd love to discuss any of the film's below, and any further viewing suggestions would be greatly appreciated! Here's my Letterboxd, for those who are interested in my filmic ramblings: http://letterboxd.com/isarge123/ 

**Mad Max (1979) - Dir. George Miller:**  
In which Max goes mad, and George Miller doesn't give a crap about how small his budget is and makes every scene feel bombastically grandiose despite their limitations. Obviously his vision isn't conveyed as truly as in *The Road Warrior* or to an ever greater extent: *Fury Road*, but I have to admire what was achieved with the means available to him. 
**8/10**  

**The Patriot (2000) - Dir. Roland Emmerich:**  
In which Mel Gibson and a small ragtag band of guys heroically defeat the utterly despicable British army. Seriously though, as much I try to knock *Mel Gibson IS The Patriot* for its blind patriotism and historical ignorance, I can't, because by golly it's well done. The photography is beautiful (the lighting in some scenes is just breathtaking), John Williams' score is appropriately sweeping, Mel Gibson is commanding and there are some touching moments of genuine humanity amongst the expertly staged battles and bloodshed. And mostly I'm just surprised that Roland Emmerich made a movie I kinda liked (I still haven't seen *Independence Day*). Ridiculous for sure, but I'm a sucker for historical epics, and this one was highly enjoyable. 
**7/10**  

**To Be Or Not To Be (1942) - Dir. Ernst Lubitsch:**  
Yikes! And I thought *The Great Dictator* had balls. An uproarious farce filled with humour as black as a Nazi swastika and featuring Ernst Lubitsch's energetic, un-showy direction and a truly terrific performance from Jack Benny. One of my new favourite comedies, heck, it's one of my new favourite films. 
**10/10**  

**Aladdin (1992) - Dir. Ron Clements &amp; John Musker:**  
An example of an excellent performance/character elevating a merely decent film to a very good one. The first act is typical enjoyable but generic Disney, but once Robin William's hilarious Genie shows up *Aladdin* takes on a life of its own. In possibly my favourite vocal performance of all time, Williams provides an unstoppable force of wildly energetic comedy, perfectly matched by the animators who at times seem like they're struggling to keep up with him (in a good way of course). Without Williams, I doubt the film would be anywhere near as inventive and stylish as it is. The music (particularly *Friend Like Me*) is sparkling as well. 
**8/10**  

**Mission: Impossible: Rogue Nation (2015) - Dir. Christopher McQuarrie:**  
I really liked this on my first viewing, and I LOVED it on the second. The plot is entirely serviceable, and despite its relentless momentum it remains easy to follow throughout. But it's McQuarrie who really steals the show, directing the proceedings with a kinetic energy that never lets up, and I still found it really suspenseful even after remembering the main plot points. The action scenes are sleek and coherent, with too many masterfully-executed pieces of exhilaration to possibly pick a favourite. A generous but enthusiastic 
**9/10**  

**The Dressmaker (2015):**  
A well-acted, handsomely shot but clumsily told tale. Kate Winslet admirably attempts to keep things grounded, Judy Davis is very funny in a scene-stealing performance and Hugo Weaving lends sincerity and heart to his overdone stereotype. But the whole film constantly switches from (sometimes absurdist) comedy to disturbing moments of tragedy, and the frequent tonal shifts never really worked for me. I understand that I don't really fit the demographic for this movie, but regardless of how much it did or didn't appeal to me, *The Dressmaker* is still a mess. 
**4.5/10**  

**Bringing Up Baby (1938) - Dir. Howard Hawks:**  
Cary Grant is a palaeontologist trying to obtain the lost bone of a brontosaurus. Katherine Hepburn is a possible nutcase trying to obtain Grant's heart, and keep her pet leopard in check. These characters inhabit one of the funniest comedies I've ever seen. I was laughing myself silly even on this second watch. The screenplay is excellent, but it's Howard Hawk's manic direction and the wildly energetic performances that keep this rollicking ride as fun and as fast as it is. Katherine Hepburn is frankly amazing. She explodes off the screen with such chaotic force that it makes you want to duck for cover whenever she opens her mouth. Cary Grant is also at his best as the poor soul destined to endure Hepburn's harassment and the crazy adventure that follows. 
**9.5/10**  

**Monsieur Hulot's Holiday (1953) - Dir. Jacques Tati:**  
So it was my birthday and I impulsively treated myself to the superb *Jacques Tati Restored Collection* Blu-Ray, despite having seen none of his movies. My first foray into the filmography of Jacques Tati was a thoroughly enjoyable one, a warm holiday that ends with a bang (well, lots of them). Unfortunately I decided to watch this while tired and mentally preoccupied, which doesn't help when many of the gags require utmost attention to fully appreciate, despite the relaxing tone that permeates the whole film. Then again, Tati's creation isn't really a *film*. It's a world. I think I'll appreciate this even more once I'm more familiar with his style and in a better position to watch this. I still loved it. 

**9/10**  

**Jour de Fete/The Big Day (1949) - Jacques Tati:**  
Being a lesser-known Tati, I wasn't expecting this one to be as good as it was. Obviously Tati is a master behind the camera, but in this he's equally brilliant in front of it. Nearly everything Francois does, from swinging his satchel dramatically around his shoulder to the general way in which he talks, is hilarious. If my journey with Tati continues at this delightful rate he'll be shooting up my favourite directors list in no time. A slightly pricey purchase that definitely payed off.

"d39m9hq","It's not uncommon at all for gacha games to include stuff outside of what is being featured.

Replying to this because I typically don't agree with comparing the more hardcore gacha games with KHX. Most of KHX's 5\*s are basically 4\*s in other games (even the rate is comparable). The ""real"" 5\*s for KHX would be the stronger limited stuff that's not yet out in global, like the few that only have a 6\* version. KHX may seem more casual and generous, but in the end you need a minimum of 7 copies (yeah there's brooms but those aren't really handed out on a silver platter) to be able to really max a character, and that could be much higher if you're aiming to fully max guilt. Also, KHX's pools also include a bunch of old and crappy stuff. Even most, if not all, of JP's gachas so far have included stuff from set 1 &amp; 2. Just felt like this comparison needed more context.

The difference is that KHX offers a wider array of freebies or guaranteed stuff on multi-draws than many other gacha games do. In my opinion, it doesn't make it explicitly better. It just works for the kind of game that it is.

I'm not just trying to defend TOLink here though, I do hate how it always has the basic pool included and that the re-issued/old 5\*s are what have a rate up rather than the new 5\*s.

"d2uyyon","Depends on what you are writing and what you want to use your characters for.

In short stories you might not need to develop a backstory for your character in order make them serve the function you want. The short story might not even need to go into the character you are telling about. Rather, it is the theme or message you want focus on.

However, in novels, I usually develop backstories, families, friends, hobbies, values and so on. I have listed some basic points below (in no particular order), which might help when developing a character.

1)When I develop a character, I grant them an attribute, weakness, struggle or a part of my dashing personality. I’ve found that it is easier to explain characters actions, if the characters are somewhat rooted in yourself. For example, being someone who overthinks a lot of situations, I have given a character that trait as well, guiding the reader through her thought process. This leads me to expand on her strange conclusions and subsequently strange actions. 

2) I want to make them flawed. It makes a character so much more interesting to read (and write) about. For example, a good natured leader, who is kind and generous, but has a vicious temper which makes him difficult to predict. Or a well-spoken and sharp diplomat, who reads humans easily, but is also a huge coward and a terrible husband. 

3)Think about what made you really like or dislike a certain character in a book, movie, comic or any media of fiction: What were the components of said character? For example, why do so many love Snake in Harry Potter, or dislike Joffery from Game of Thrones? Certainly, the acting is superb in the movie and series, but the writing behind the characters tells us who they are either directly or indirectly. 

4)I have over the years developed a ridiculous amount of pages, where all my characters are described in detail. I have listed everything about them, not only background story, but also relations with other characters, ideological and personal beliefs, how they would interpret certain actions and so on. I don’t think it is the right way for every writer to do so, but personally I love always having a “cheat sheet” I can return to. If you like being detail oriented, I can wholeheartedly recommend it.  

Now this is the very basics of character creation. But you should note that this might not apply to you, as every writer has different approaches to character creation and writing. Anyway I still hope it helps, if just a little bit.

Basically the author uses a number of mods to have all of her characters in the same world at once and they are all playable (you can switch between them at any time). When you're not using them you can see them idling in their hometowns or you can have them band together with one another. Instead of having One character become the leader of all factions, you can play with the development of the world as a whole from several different perspectives. Its not perfect from what I've read, but its certainly something to look into. 

You could also add some unique NPC's to the world of your own. For instance, a wildly overpowered enemy who is always moving (at a walking pace) in you direction. I always liked that idea because it would force you to have to stay ahead of it at all times. Maybe add an equally powerful enemy who is stationary somewhere (that way the only way to beat the one would be to pit it against the other). 

Barring that there are all kinds of lore friendly quest/dungeon mods for more content. 

If you want to build a character with personality, perhaps try the most recent version of alternate start and ponder your reason for being in Skyrim. Were you born there? Did you come to the land as and immigrant, a refugee, a merchant, a bodyguard, a courier, a tourist, etc.? Add quirks and personality flaws to your character. Little things that make it come alive. Are you kind and generous, but a little bit crazy? Maybe try being a reverse thief. Pickpocket things into peoples inventory like potions, jewelry, or sweet rolls. Are you a hunter looking to make a name for yourself in the histories of tamriel? Get the Enhanced Mighty Dragons Mod and Hunt down every name on that list. Don't go alone, crank that difficulty up and bring as many followers as you can to make sure the job gets done. Remember, its not about saving Tamriel or Skyrim, its about getting famous. Who cares if there are a few bodies in the way. 

One of my personal favorites: Take the merchant approach. Download the mod for the Dwemer airship base the Asteria. You are a merchant who flies from country to country selling your wears and your services. As a master producer and trader of goods you deck out your band of mercenaries in the best gear possible and do the jobs no one else will do. They need you to sack a city in the name of civil war?

Yes, but we're calorie restricted, so that food isn't free.  It comes out of our budget -- it's just not dollars in the budget, it's calories.  

Some random thoughts:

* quantity is not quality -- there is no added merit in large portions of merely average food.  This holds true even if the food is great -- there's nothing in that second helping that wasn't in the first.  If you're spending your calories and going for seconds, make it something else that is not everyday store-bought junk-food junk.
* at least half of what is being served is below average, by mathematical law -- so shop wisely.
* crowds and noise make me eat quickly (and overeat) -- so I'm not going to put a lot on my plate.  I am going to put one thing and a small amount of it, and then go socialize a while away from the food as I enjoy slowly.  I'm not going to let the frenetic activity cause me to rush through the food and subtract from my enjoyment of it or the event.  
* you're probably going over budget anyway -- give yourself a generous but reasonable allowance and ""save up"" for the event by eating lightly in the days before and right after the event.  I've found that I'm never hungry for breakfast the day after a party -- I'm still satiated from the night before.  There's a few hundred calories right there.  And I can sometimes eat light all day on the day of the party knowing that I'm going to go a little heavier (including a drink) at the party.  
* the goal is to lose weight and live your life at the same time.  You have to balance these -- eating lighter than you used to but not cutting yourself off.  Balance is hard and you may struggle, it's okay.  Just do your best but keep these two rules topmost
 * have fun, its a party
 * stay in control, its not a blank check

"d23732d","So, your questions have sort of transformed from ""what does Locke think?"" into ""what is libertarianism?""  Those are two different questions, although there is obviously a large degree of overlap.  Lots of libertarians consider themselves Lockean, but plenty don't.  Also, lots of Lockeans consider themselves libertarians, but plenty don't.  This question, of how much Locke and libertarianism are the same thing, is 100% a matter of what definition of ""libertarianism"" you use.

But here's what I'll say as far as Locke goes, anyway:

For Locke, his theory of property is absolutely conditioned upon how he sees initial conditions.  However, he sees these initial conditions as inherently fair.  He theorizes about a ""state of nature"" in which humankind was wandering around the earth, and in which nobody owned anything, really.  Over time, these hunter-gatherer humans occasionally settled down and started (usually) farming.

Here's where we come to the question of distribution.  According to Locke's thinking, the initial distribution of land (among hunter-gatherers who tried to start farming) was pretty much inherently fair.  There was so much land available, and so few people, that the value of land was basically nil compared to the value of human labor.  Locke says a couple times in the Second Treatise that labor makes up over 90% the value in a farm, or really any other thing.  In Locke's mind, pretty much everyone - again, during this initial pre-society moment - had the opportunity to find, develop and farm a good piece of land.

So, according to Locke's thinking, there was no unfairness in the initial distribution of land.  Everyone had an opportunity at first.  

This DIRECTLY ties into his theory of how you can come to ""own"" land.  In short, the problem is this: if I plant seeds and harvest the crops, I can claim that I ""own"" those crops.  But how can I ""own"" the land itself?  After all, pre-society, nobody owned the land, and thus it belonged to everyone.  Even if someone ""mixes their labor with the land,"" aren't they still ""taking"" it from the community?

The answer, for Locke, is twofold: first, as another poster has mentioned, and as I talked about a little bit in my previous post and earlier in this one, Locke simply thought there was so much land available that it didn't matter.  Even if someone fenced off a farm for themselves, they weren't functionally ""taking"" land from everyone else, because ""there is enough, and as good, left in common for others.""  So, Locke didn't think it was a problem.

Secondly, though, Locke recognized that labor was capable of making permanent improvements to a piece of land.  If I build a fence, or clear rocks, or accumulate a supply of seeds, or breed a better type of cow, those improvements will last well beyond my lifetime.  By mixing my labor with the land, and making capital improvements to it, I haven't only developed a valid claim on the fruits of that labor, but I've also developed a claim that I and my descendants should be able to use that land in perpetuity.

Now, we come to the problem of what happens generations later, when the population has exploded and there isn't enough land for everyone.  Again, it's important to note that in Locke's time, any Englishman who wanted cheap land could travel to North America and get some, so this wasn't really a problem in his day.  But generally, I think his position would be that people who improve the value of land with their labor should be able to pass that on to their descendants, and that this is justifiable precisely because the initial distribution of land had been fair, pre-society.

So, the original distribution was, in Lockean theory, done in accordance with libertarian principles.  As a result, he doesn't reach the question of whether it would be just to uphold a system with unjust bases.  For him, justice was done in the beginning.

But Locke nevertheless does recognize that, even if the beginnings of property were totally fair, the ownership of property in future generations will become less and less fair.  He acknowledges these positive feedback loops of which you speak, saying that the lazy children of productive people will inherit property from their parents, and productive children of lazy parents will not.  Over the course of many generations, this could lead to real inequality.

This is obviously unfair, and he recognizes this.  So what is his response?  Well, he basically says that in a pre-society stage, which doesn't have money, it will be nearly impossible for even productive parents to accumulate generational levels of wealth: if you can't store wealth, you can only pass onto your children as much land as your family can work itself.  So, the system limits inequality when there isn't money at play.

But when we're talking about a civil society which does use money, Locke recognizes the possibility of accumulations of large amounts of generational wealth, and the growing inequality which can result from this.  He doesn't think it's a good thing, necessarily, but he justifies it on three fronts.  First, society consented to the use of money (or so he argues), so it has consented to allowing the accumulation of familial wealth.  Second, people have the right to leave their justly acquired property to their children, and disrespecting these property rights is for him unjust even if utilitarian principles would suggest otherwise - someone worked hard to improve that land and pass it on to their children, after all.  Finally, again, there is so much land even in Locke's day that he just didn't think it was an issue - just because one person had more land didn't mean anyone else had any less.

I'll finish by giving my two cents: Locke is only partially right about the ""state of nature"" and how society and property ownership came to be formed.  Humans were not solitary wanderers in prehistoric days, but tribal communities fighting with one another over resources which were almost always functionally scarce.  Hell, humans probably first migrated out of Africa because they lost a struggle for grazing land with other humans who stayed in Africa, where the best known lands were located.  

Farming developed about ten thousand years ago, but the best farmlands were often taken by neighboring tribes when possible.  In short, I do not think that the distribution of property in the world today reflects a world formed via libertarian principles.  Almost all the land owned across the world today is on some level the result of a conquest or other unjust taking.  There was not and has never been any fairness in the process of land allocation.

So, in my opinion, Locke has it wrong, and your suspicions are right: the original distribution was probably not in accordance with libertarian principles, and even if it was the ""chain of ownership"" has been broken by conquest innumerable times over the years.

So what should libertarianism say about this injustice?  In my opinion, it should develop a response based on Rawlsian principles and small-government applications of them.  Rawls posited that ethical decision making could best be done behind a ""veil of ignorance"" in which everyone was ignorant of their starting circumstances in life.  He thinks that if nobody were aware of their starting conditions (how much money your parents have, how smart and industrious you are, etc), people would be more likely to favor at least a partial social safety net - after all, even the naturally smartest and most industrious people might never succeed in life if they're born into bad circumstances, and sometimes hard-working people just have bad luck and no savings when they get laid off.  

My Rawlsian-libertarianism, if you will, would invest heavily in childhood nutrition, education and other support, and would generally make an active effort to ensure that people born into bad circumstances at least have the chance to escape them.  The safety net would be less generous, but still present, for adults who are going through rough times.  And social security I absolutely would keep, because I'd think of how much harder it would be to find a job if I had to compete with a bunch of 65-year-olds when I was 21.

In short (not that this comment has been short), I think it's okay for a libertarian to favor a social safety net, and a strong childhood education platform.  To me, a libertarian is someone who generally favors small-government solutions because such solutions are generally the best ones.  But I also firmly believe that there are some things which libertarianism just doesn't solve for, and generational inequality is one of them.  I'm not going to follow a pure libertarian system off a cliff when it's obvious to me that pure libertarianism is never going to fix this issue.  

So quit worrying about Lockean theory.

"d1ouxav","I'm not a socialist in the sense that everything must be shared and I fundamentally believe that we should have the freedom to do whatever we chose to do so long as we respect individual freedoms and liberties as justified in a free and democratic society (I am Canadian and the Charter of Rights and Freedoms is the perfect embodiment of individual freedoms vs authority of the state).

I still think that ownership of capital is good and that there will always be a hierarchy of sorts within business. I disagree that there should be equal sharing of power in relation to business structure but I do believe that there should be fair compensation.

The reality is that over a certain threshold, ownership of such vast amounts of wealth is pointless as it cannot be carried over once you die and it does so much damage to so many people in terms of inequality. This includes earning caps on CEO pay and severe taxation over certain thresholds. This can be mitigated by giving money to employees, capital re-investment, donation to foundations, investment in training, new hires, etc. Ultimately, that much wealth cannot be centralized.

I think that inheritance should be capped at a specific amount that is generous but no egregious and any monies left over are returned to the state for redistribution into society. The fact that wealth can be handed over the generations has led to this mess. We have individuals who have vast amounts of wealth and have never had to work to get it.

As money is power, this is very dangerous and leads to people looking to get out from paying taxes as they are severely disconnected from society.

What exactly do you think ISIS hopes to gain from these attacks? They're fighting an ongoing war on about a dozen fronts already. Why waste resources on killing a handful of people in Europe?

The reason is that they want to provoke the West into making a mistake. ISIS knows that they can't win the psychological war if we stick to our principles, so they're trying to get us to abandon those principles. When we crack down on Islam, we validate ISIS's propaganda and drive new recruits to their army. We're letting them lure us into playing the game on *their* terms, when we should be playing it on *ours*.

I just knew that it was ""love"" because I wasn't trying to get into her pants like with most girls. All I wanted was to talk to her and get to know her. Once I finally did, she was perfect (to me). We had similar interests, we were in the same field of study, and I could be myself without worrying about who I am. 

To inject into that, the girl I dated before was somewhat toxic. She didn't like the fact that I was a gamer and that I would act like me. One time she told me that I was lucky to have her because no girl would want to be with a guy like me, someone who likes gaming and what not. I remember when she told me that I had stormed off and didn't speak to her for days. Once I finally did, emphasis on I, she said she didn't feel she was in the wrong. Her and her mom agreed that what she said was the truth. 

Back to the ""one"", I was just into for the longest time. Left my ex to try and have something romantic with her but I felt guilty for leaving my ex that I never went through with it. We would go back and forth after that but we never fully dated. Up until she graduated I told her how I felt but by then she was already with someone she loved and now they're getting married. Since that, no girl has really looked my way, I've tried to make connections with other girls, some I didn't know had a bf and kinda rubbed that in my face when he was finally revealed, some kinda just ignored me, some will think I'm older than I am, cus I look like 10 years older due to a lot of facial hair, and others just don't find me interesting.

One of the privileges of being an American citizen is that your eligibility to receive aid is determined by your income and circumstance (and eventually your efforts to find work, etc.), and not the generous whims of other people. Were you in a situation of need, you would be granted the ability to *not* be at the mercy of other people. They aren't looking at the fact that you have a smartphone and condemning you, not knowing that you just lost your job or came into a crippling medical expense, your phone was paid for long ago, and you've held on to it because it's your damn phone. Individuals, however, will try and judge things from shallow external appearances and completely shun someone from a true need based on a false assumption. No one should have to go through that. Literally no one deserves to be barred from help because of a presumptuous and judgmental person, and that is literally what would happen if help and aid were trusted to the discretion of ordinary citizens. Some people are wonderfully generous, but as many people as currently need help, there are not enough people with high enough incomes to relieve any situation as it comes along. Charities have limits.

There's a reason that aid programs were written in the past, mandatory wage laws were put in effect (employers would pay next to nothing if they could get away with it), and they still have a role today. It's because it worked and continues to work, and works better than ""maybe someone will help you; good luck!"" Trust that the issue has already been wrestled with decades ago and in the present it's just a matter of adapting policies to keep welfare and aid to what they were meant to be (temporary).

&gt;As far as the AWB and crime rate drop goes, I think 2 things: 1) the economy was doing much better in the 90's and early 2000's than it has been over the last decade, and poverty is the biggest driver of crime there is. 2) All rifles -not just those covered by an awb- make up 2% of homicides and even less in violent crime, so I don't think restricting those would have any real impact.

See, now it gets complicated now doesn't it? The points that you made are all relevant, but not substantiated (you haven't presented any numbers or sound arguments. ""I think"" isn't exactly scientific), so you haven't quite excluded the AWB as the underlying cause.

1. The authors should've mentioned it. But again, because DC's population is small, it won't have much of an impact on the statistical conclusion. It's a drop in the ocean, so much so that I bet the numbers don't even change.

2. &amp; 4. Spoken like someone who's wholly unqualified to interpret the data set. If you carried that mindset into medicine, you'd have to reject all of it. Every Single Treatment. Clinical trials are all correctional studies, and every treatment that your doctor prescribes is based on the the correlation between your demographic and the maximized intended benefit. Spurious causes are rare. The authors of the cited study presented solid statistical evidence that indicate gun regulations reduce gun deaths. The burden of evidence is on you to disprove their finding.

Further, the two points that you presented are completely irrelevant. The author actually accounted for ""good"" guns in their study by not making a distinction. Their finding suggests that regulation of all guns, regardless of good or bad, leads to decreases in gun violence.

3) While longitudinal studies are generally better, the lack of historical data does not beg any question. The authors' presented the most current data, so it's the most valid for projection. As to why they didn't look into the readily available historical data? My guess is funding (almost all research boils down to this). There's 3 MD's and 2 research doctorates as authors. If the Joyce foundation gave them $100k for this study (which is generous, but fair, estimate) and we ignore all research related costs (which are quite high); the grant would've supported their salaries for just 4 weeks + 1 day.

5) Since you still can't see it, I'm going to assume that you didn't read the paper, at least in detail. Table 3 specifically studies homicides and suicides separately. This is an open access (and very good) paper, so I highly suggest that you read and understand it.

&gt;Another thing I failed to mention, is how they determine ""strong gun control laws""? all the article tells us is 

It's detailed in table one. Obstacles to purchase are weighed much more heavily than current possession, which reflects the intent of the paper well. This is a moot point though, since there has not be any valid challenges to the methods of this paper, besides the lack of longitudinal data. That, however, iis a call for further studies, not a challenge to the validity of the conclusions of the current study.

&gt;Really? He only partially answered questions like here, avoided answe...

Again, most of those questions have no bearing on the conclusions of the paper. Most of it is borderline ad hominem attacks (rather than legitimate challenges to his qualifications or methods) or irrelevant points (that even addressed, have no bearing on the interpretation of his data) raised by obviously unqualified individuals. Case in point:

&gt;ignores every question about whether other gun laws could have been responsible (such as allowing concealed cary)

His study actually covers this. It's listed under table 1, restrictions to ""shall issue"" concealed carry is one of the qualifying gun regulations that he studied.

You have to realize that hes a doctor (and I'll agree that he's narrow minded in this matter, which I'll explain later), his time is expensive and his character is rather blunt. (Again, I haven't read everything yet) He seems to avoid engaging in discussion with people who are not on intellectually qualified to understand and accept the answers that he will provide. Again, [case in point](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/3zx8xc/science_ama_series_im_david_hemenway_director_of/cypy5fy), his paper answers this: he suggests restricting the purchase of firearms. It's cheap (only cost is enforcement), firearms aren't essential to daily life, and resolves the raised issue perfectly. Further on this point, you have to realize that he's a doctor. He really doesn't care how much you don't want the surgery or how expensive treatment is, his endgame is only the intended benefit, the methods (outside the archaic deontological ethics prescribed by the AMA) are irrelevant.

FWIW, I'm a gun owner and against most of the proposed firearms regulation, including the implied recommendations of this paper. As a scientist, I accept the findings of this paper. It's not only a valid study, it's a good study. Methods are solid, design is innovative, and presentation is beautiful. It should be intuitive that if we ban all guns, there would be no legal guns. If there are no legal guns, then the supply of illegal guns will be scarce. And if the supply of illegal guns is scarce, then crimes involving a gun will become scarce. But banning guns is fking unamerican and there are more elegant (but more expensive and harder) ways to solve this issue, such as eliminating poverty.",1454901341,"if the joyce foundation gave them $100k for this study (which is generous, but fair, estimate) and we ignore all research related costs (which are quite high); the grant would've supported their salaries for just 4 weeks + 1 day.","generous, but fair","generous","but",TRUE,"generous , but fair","fair",NA,NA,1
"czrn7qx","&gt; but the fact the people like him and your husband are able to fill in on typically nontraditional roles, isn't that a sign that we're collectively loosening our grip on stereotypes?

ABLE is the keyword in your sentence. Men have always been ABLE to be successful homemakers and raise children. They did not magically become able to do that because it's now 2016 and not 1950. Gender roles are based on society's perception of the role men and women should fulfill. Just because it's been demonstrated that men succeed in an area women are thought to be superior in doesn't mean that knowledge has been passed on to society. I think what you mean is the fact that men CAN be homemakers is proof that society is loosening its grip on gender roles and while that may be somewhat true, the poster above you countered that idea with the fact that it's still not generally accepted by other people that men can succeed as homemakers.

&gt;Gender roles do exist. Men and women are different and can provide very different and positive things for the world. I don't think it's sexist, I think it's acknowledging the strengths of different genders.

Here's the thing. Gender roles are incredibly outdated and account for a very narrow view of society. For example, gender roles for women say that they are naturally maternal and generous but you and I both know that that is not true of all women. So say 70% of women naturally conform to their gender role. That still leaves 30%, or hundreds of millions of women world wide, unaccounted for. So is a statement that is only 70% true really an accurate portrayal of female behavior? Would we publish a finding if it had an error rate of 30%? Hell no! That would be bad science.

Here's where things get even more tricky. The only two options for gender roles are male and female. Generally, those two options correlate to a person's genitals but what about people born with both? What about people who have XY chromosomes but are immune to testosterone and have the body of a woman?  Is that person male because of their chromosomes or female because of their vagina? What about people with XYXX or XXY chromosomes? What about the gender roles of people who transition? Does a trans woman conform to male gender roles until they transition then magically switch or did they always conform to female gender roles? When does this switch happen? When they make the decision to live as a woman? When they start taking hormones? When they have surgery? Where can you draw the line? Alternatively, what about people who aren't trans but have the brain patterns of the opposite gender like a woman who takes a gender brain test and scores on the masculine side? Does she still conform to female gender roles even though her brain conforms to male gender roles and the test proves she's better at things typically men are better at? There's just so much gray area and absolutely no consensus that women are unilaterally better at X and men are unilaterally better at Y. Sure, there are patterns that the average woman is better at X and the average man is better at Y but if you understand statistics, you know that there are a considerable number of data points that aren't any where near the average range cluster and the average doesn't really represent a fair picture that demonstrates the full data range. That's what gender roles are like - an average that only paints a part of the picture.

If you want to make it super realistic have just a small scene where some guy (say the bass player) is tuning up then right as he's tuning up have the drummer or guitarist start playing and have just a moment where you can tell the bass player is mildly peeved by this. 


I don't know what the fuck happens but I've played in bands for like 15 years on and off and I swear to God, if someone in a four piece band has to tune up there's like a 90-95% chance one of the other three chooses right then to start into a riff they like, or tuning their own instrument, or fucking with an effect pedal. 


Also 40 people seems potentially generous but believable. I've definetly played to even more than 40, but if you're not very popular you're probably talking about a weekday gig, or maybe like 7pm on Saturday before people are really showing up downtown. So if you're not really popular say maybe 12 people show up. 


Also for added realism have one guy in the band have a problem with something buzzing. Trying to figure out what's causibg a buzz is really common since it can be a faulty cord, an old potentiometer, an effects pedal with a weird setting, a nut with some defect, improperly intimated guitar, loose drum heads, drum kit clamp not secured fully, feedback from the PA.

"cxedej4","Most of the time, nobody who subscribes to you for giveaways will stay for your content. Sure there may be one or two exceptions, but with giveaways you'll gain subscribers in numbers only. View counts won't change nearly in proportion with subs. Also, using giveaways for the purpose of gaining subs, like ""if you're subscribed, you have a chance to win!"" may be against YouTube's TOS.

I'm only telling you this because I thought about doing it and people who've done it warned me not to. Giveaways can still help with real growth though, and the people who told me not to also gave alternatives. If you do giveaways in the middle of a video without advertising it, people will have to watch your content, thereby making them HAVE to watch your content and (hopefully) want to watch more videos if they want to participate. This could even be with small things, like a shout out in the next video. For example you could say, ""I'll give a shout out to the first 3 people to leave a comment with the words ""nutter butter"" in it."" This is zero cost to you, gets you viewers feeling engaged, adds comment metrics, and your shout out could be as simple as ""Shout out to these people who commented ""nutter butter,"" in x video"" and show a screen cap of the comments. Eventually, you could work your way up to steam codes and such.

When advertised and for the purpose of gaining subs, giveaways are kinda meh. If you do it as a thank you and leave it open, that's cool and generous, but if you want to do it to drive growth, it needs to be fairly regular, hidden within videos, and help drive your community's growth.

I hope you reach your goal! Happy Thanksgiving to you too~ :)

New York: Dodd, Mead &amp;amp; Co., 1971. The Neglected Hardy: Thomas Hardy s Lesser Novels. London: Macmillan; New York: St Martin s Press, 1982. Taylor, Richard H., ed.
It would have been as easy for the heath-ponies, bats, and snakes to be vulgar as for her. It is a shooting-script.” Though little read today, The Dynasts presents Hardy’s idea of “evolutionary meliorism,” the hope that human action could make life better. Hardy) The Later Years of Thomas Hardy, 1892-1928 (autobiography), Macmillan, 1930. Wessex Tales (1888, a collection of short stories)
He is patient and generous, but also deeply determined, and fierce when angered: it is this determination that leads to his eventual split with his mother, and separation from Eustacia. See, here s the wagon-track at last. Susy, dear, you and I will have a jig—hey, my honey? She has just come home, I believe, with her husband.
Thereupon the contour of a man became dimly visible against the low-reaching sky over the valley, beyond the outer margin of the pool. By one , by two , by three ; Are you not much obliged to me for making you one? 6—The Figure against the Sky
At the end of the novel, weakened by a degenerative eye condition and by the trauma of losing his mother and Eustacia--for whose deaths he blames himself--he becomes an itinerant preacher, sermonizing about simple moral topics. She understood the scene in a moment. This is the pleasure I have won by my trouble, she whispered bitterly. If, in passing under one of the Egdon banks, any of its thick skeins were caught, as they sometimes were, by a prickly tuft of the large Ulex Europoeus—which will act as a sort of hairbrush—she would go back a few steps, and pass against it a second time.

"cx9v2p9","And so we trudged on. Any fatigue was met with an explosion of energy once the curtain went up. Any pain was met with the adrenaline of thousands of voices singing along. Every one of you kept us alive for a while there. One night, at a point where I felt like I was at the end of my rope, it came to me that these few hours we have together every night were something like a heavy blanket to retreat under. I could always rely on our time together to get me to the next stop. Again, and again. From Chicago to Cesena.

That being said....we’ve always been pretty good at knowing when to call it a day. You just....know. You get that feeling that, if you’re not careful, you’ll run out of bread crumbs to find your way home and be lost in the woods forever. It hit me a few months back, crept up on me and tapped me on the shoulder as if to say “Hey...don’t spend it all in one place, asshole.” A sobering reminder that all good things must come to an end. Of course...we could keep going. After all, we’d made it this far, right? What’s another 20 years?

Around that time we arrived in Austin, Texas for the Austin City Limits festival. A massive gig, two weekends and hundreds of acts, it was to be some of our final American performances for this album. There’s a certain bittersweet relief to that. On one hand, you’re carrying these monumental experiences under your wing as you anticipate life outside of a tour bus. On the other hand, you fear that the thrill and joy of sharing music with people all over the world will leave you like an empty shell when it’s gone. It becomes your everything. And that’s terrifying.

The Saint Cecilia Hotel, named after the patroness saint of music, is known as “A lush retreat from the world”. And, believe me, that it is! 14 rooms and a small bar, it’s tucked away in the trees within a bustling, Austin neighborhood. As our van pulled up in the wee hours of September 30th, 2015, I was struck with a rather impulsive idea: to record some songs on our days off to give to the world as a “thank you” for the last 2 years. Though there’s a world class recording studio just on the other side of the fence (Arlyn Studios, look it up.), the hotel manager, Jenny offered that we record in the hotel. A most generous, but unrealistic offer. Though, after rolling it around in my head a few times, it made perfect sense! Returning to the city where the entire Sonic Highways concept was born, loading in one last time to a room that was never designed to be a recording studio a la Sonic Highways, and making some music! Fate? Destiny? I was too tired to figure that kind of shit out, so I hit the sack, woke up the next morning and started making some calls...

By 6 pm the next day, the office was transformed into a control room and the bar was littered with microphones and cables. Amps were in the kitchen. Drums in front of the fireplace. Instant studio, courtesy of the legendary Kevin Szymanski! (Those fancy computer things are pretty convenient! More on that another time....) Margaritas were made, friends came to visit, the sun went down, and before long we started making enough noise to drive the neighbors to start drinking along with us. Riffs and ideas were thrown around, songs that were lost in the shuffle over the years, songs that were left unfinished. Like a musical retrospective, we were going through decades of songs no one has ever heard, pieces left on the cutting room floor from every album. Our own sonic scrapbook. (The Neverending Sigh is 20 years old! Was once called 7 corners for all you die hards out there...) Without the usual pressure or expectation of making an “album”, we sat happy and relaxed as we played. A virtual “This Is Your Life” of the Foo Fighters. It was so good, but again, bittersweet knowing that it was all soon coming to an end.

By midnight, the Preservation Hall Jazz Band had arrived, and the “session” turned into a full on party. Guitars were abandoned for horns and the room started swinging (spinning?). People danced between the cables and microphones, dancing behind the bar, strumming acoustic guitars on the patio. Danny Clinch did what Danny Clinch does, capturing the moments in his beautiful pictures between cocktails. Gary Clark Jr. sat on the patio in the candlelight, jamming along with friends from a couch. As the hours passed, the atmosphere had reached exactly what every recording experience should be: A celebration. “Always record! Always record!” said Jack Black in that infamous Tenacious D episode from years ago. Truer words have never been spoken. Because you just might miss something that you’ll never get back again. Moments that happen once in a lifetime. By the time that weekend was over, we had recorded 5 songs in that tiny room.

Weekend two was spent recording vocals and guitars in my bedroom, room 4. More friends, more margaritas, a fire in the fire pit. The most fabulous Cambria Harkey floated in, slinging her camera to insure that this wasn’t all just a dream. The porch was buzzing with activity as I did vocals in my bathroom, stepping in and out to listen to the previous takes. The coffee table became a pile of guitar pedals and scribbled lyrics, beer bottles and ashtrays. At one point, a familiar face walked in and said, “Dave.....it’s Ben Kweller.....” It had been years! Such a talented young man. We hugged, hit play to listen to the last vocal take, and he instinctively started singing the perfect harmony to my line. Without hesitation, I immediately said, “Get your ass in there and sing it right now.” So he picked up the coffee stained piece of hotel stationary with my lyrics penciled on it and banged out his part in two glorious takes. Always record, ladies and gentlemen. Always record. The night faded, friends and family scattered, and I fell asleep with my still glowing amp at the foot of my bed.

It was heartbreaking to leave that place, to say the least. I honestly feel like we left a piece of our band there as we were being torn away from it. The perfect unity of life, and love, and music is something that only comes around so often and in certain circumstances. When you feel it coming on, you have to take hold of it. That place and those people made it possible for our band to take one, big final breath before the curtain closes. Thankfully, we have evidence of this in these songs that we’re giving to you today. Thank you, Saint Cecilia. You made us feel right at home.

And, the music? Maybe these songs are the breadcrumbs that will help us find our way back when it’s time. We could use a nice wander through the woods right about now. Another empty journal, another tap on the shoulder...those things are never far behind. It’s what lies ahead in those woods that excites me now....

So tonight, as I sit in my Berlin hotel room on our final tour for this album, counting down the days until we return home, I can’t help but wonder when we will see each other again. Who knows? But, with everything Foo Fighter related, it will only be when it feels right. And that’s a feeling that’s easy to feel.

To each and every one of you that made the past few years the best our band has ever had, thank you. You have all given us so much, and we are eternally grateful.

For real.

One foot in front of the other....

Dave

""8 November 2015

Hey.

Thanks.

For real.

It was in Austin, Texas March 14th, 2013, at the last show of the “Sound City Players” when I was given a small, but very relevant and perhaps prophetic gift from my Sound City movie producers Jim Rota and John Ramsay. An empty journal, with a note that said something along the lines of, “Congratulations on everything Sound City.....now get to work on the next project!” It was the most beautiful way to end something that I wanted so badly to last forever: with a new beginning.

The basic concept of the Sonic Highways album and series was born right then and there, in a small backstage room surrounded by mountains of Lone Star beer and Stubbs BBQ. 8 songs, 8 cities, 8 studios, and a musical road trip of a lifetime. Removing the Foo Fighters from our comfort zone and challenging the process from top to bottom, it breathed new life into the band, and set us on a journey that unquestionably exceeded any of our simple expectations. And now it has led us here. To another beautiful ending.

So, where do I begin?

We owe it all to Mexico City.

Unbeknownst to them, the people who attended those two concerts back in December, 2013 at Foro Sol stadium helped fund the filming and recording of the bulk of the Sonic Highways project. They were the fuse that lit this little firecracker, baby. Without those gigs, many may have never heard the incredible and truly inspiring life stories of Buddy Guy, Steve Albini, Ian Mackaye, Tony Joe White, Zac Brown, Dolly Parton, Roky Erickson, Gary Clark Jr, Bruce Pavitt, Fred Drake, Terry Lickona, Joan Jett, Steve Rosenthal, Nora Guthrie......a list too long to share here. But, beyond giving our band the equivalent of a rock and roll university year abroad, they gave the entire world the most priceless gift: Inspiration. So....Gracias a todos, Mexico....we couldn’t have done it without you.

Before long, our rag tag crew of ne’er-do-wells was stumbling from city to city, coast to coast, taking in every drop (!) of 100 proof American culture we could squeeze. Dancing in a New Orleans second line parade, laying under the desert stars in Joshua Tree, walking the streets of Chicago in -30 degree weather...it was an American dream come true. Our only responsibility was to share it with you, and the brave people of HBO trusted us with that much. (very freely, I might add.) Blind faith? Perhaps. But, without Nina Rosenstein, we would not be the people who we are today. Looking back, she gave us something immeasurably generous: some of the greatest memories of our lives. These people and places that we experienced have filled our hearts...and ultimately our songs. So, thank you, Nina. We are yours. But, focused on the moment, we never in our wildest dreams could have imagined the whirlwind 23 months that lay ahead of us. We just put one foot in front of the other, and kept moving....

I must admit, I never looked at our schedule. I was too scared. I knew that this was it. This was the big one. There was talk of stadiums, and anniversaries, and TV shows. South Africa, Korea, Colombia. Letterman and Glastonbury. It all seemed too good to be true! But, as always, we kept our heads down and tried to appreciate every single moment as it fled. Because, you realize, none of this was ever supposed to happen. Ever. As we approached our twentieth anniversary, it was hard not to look back on all of those years and smile while shaking our heads in wonder and disbelief. From the Mike Watt van tour of 1995, to RFK stadium in Washington DC (my hometown gig) July 4th, 2015...those dots don’t necessarily connect in real life, you know? It still boggles the mind. But, the spoils of these blessings are not lost upon us. We count every last one.

Even the disasters.

A lucky break? Yeah, you could call it that. Gothenburg was a swift reminder that life is short, and that we’re all here to live it together, no matter what adversity you’re faced with. (Music! The perfect remedy!) Sure, weeks and weeks of shuffling around hotel rooms on my butt with a cast on my leg, trying to pack my suitcase alone before lobby call got pretty fucking stale pretty fucking quick. But, as always, I just put one foot in front of......well, the same one for a while there...

And then everything changed. The energy. The atmosphere. THE THRONE. I was no longer afraid to look at the schedule, I was glued to it. The challenge that we faced from there on out became more of a mission, or a dare, if you will. And it showed. Pat’s smile got even wider (an infallible barometer of all things), Chris’s solos got even faster (thank God someone knows what they’re doing up there), Nate’s stage moves more daring (I once noticed him just to the left of me) and Taylor’s drum set....well....it got pinker. But not without the help of scores of hardworking bad asses that some might call the Foo Fighters road crew (we like refer to them as family, in a very Manson Family kind of way...) They ultimately deserve the lion’s share of credit for keeping this old circus tent erect for the past 6 months. So, let’s all have a nice, warm diet Coke for them tonight. They’re the hardest working motherfuckers in the business. Cheers.

And so we trudged on. Any fatigue was met with an explosion of energy once the curtain went up. Any pain was met with the adrenaline of thousands of voices singing along. Every one of you kept us alive for a while there. One night, at a point where I felt like I was at the end of my rope, it came to me that these few hours we have together every night were something like a heavy blanket to retreat under.

The guy is loaded and obviously already had some experience with gold diggers. Hence he is VERY careful about women. He has a kind heart and is a sensitive personality which probably gets easily hurt in a relationship. This is the reason he has just a handful real friends at best. Money doesn't have the same value to him, instead he has very high requirements for people he considers respectable enough to let into his life. Hence he kept you at arms length until he gets more comfortable with you. His generosity towards your family shows: He would have spent money on you! So he tested your personal stand on money: Is it important to you? Gold diggers are very smart in denying that, hence he has to be very cunning with his testing.

And there's where you fucked up: Once you heard he's loaded and generous but not generous on *YOU*, you got sad, jelous, felt neglected and all that. You ""hinted"" (aka ""blackmailing with feelings"") you wanted a part of that wealth to be spent on you. He made his views clear to you (""No money spend on you""), still you were questioning them. The question about wether you feel jelous about his sister is so revealing: He tested your reaction to other people receiving generosity. People who don't long for money would have felt happy for her, but you instead felt disappointed that he didn't give the same present to you. Checkmate. You blew it.

"custor1","Reddit, I know you tried.  It was a great idea, but it failed.  I teach History in high school.  The software offered by Educents is useless to me - the only one that might have worked requires me to use a credit card, and get charged later if I don't cancel in time.  The one option I thought might work was the $20 gift card, which sounded lovely and generous, but really wasn't.  I don't think it is worthwhile to get charged $9 in shipping for ""$20"" worth of stuff that is overpriced to the point of it being cheaper to buy the same stuff elsewhere than pay the $9 for the shipping.  I don't want to feel or seem ungrateful, but I do feel a bit sold out.  Educents, unfortunately, reminds me of those carnival games where ""everyone gets a prize!"", and it turns out the prize is a 5 cent toy that you just payed a dollar to ""win"".  I hope the other options were more useful to the elementary teachers here, but looking at the gallery, I doubt it.
My husband wasn't even given this much.  He was simply told he didn't qualify.  We both teach high school.  He's in English.  I don't know why he doesn't qualify, and neither does he.  Perhaps y'all were getting to the end of things and realized that not enough gifters had signed up?  He tried last year, too, but his Santa never came through with anything at all, and there was no rematch to be had.  (Mine was fantastic, and very much appreciated last year!)
Thanks, anyway, Reddit.  But this is why there's no post in the gallery from me.  I'm happy for the other teachers out there who got matched, but maybe next year, just tell us that there's nothing left.  We'll understand.  We're used to it.  We don't feel ""entitled"" to a gift just because we're teachers (though it's amazing and awesome that the people who do become Santas for our students are so generous!)

There are many very gentle and generous but dreamy teachers out there. I had a mathematic prof who was very hard to understand and would introduce new concepts without explaining them. However if you asked questions you could see his eyes light up and he would take time to explain everything with patience, respect and with no sign of judgment or critic. Best part, if somebody still needed help, they were invited to show up for a few private sessions. 

Otherwise, with your kind of teacher, you have no other choice but to look up the stuff and work in group. Or you could start a mouvement to get her replaced (that could heavily backfire though)

You probably could get out of it by just giving them a generous but fair amount and leaving, but this is a giant city with tons of different people both decent and shady, so maybe it was smart to play it safe.

1. Fatih means Conqueror, yes. It's the name of [the district](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b6/Istanbul_districts.png), which is named after Sultan Mehmed II the Conqueror, who, well, conquered the city in 1453.

3. Power outages in Istanbul is a pretty common occurence. Just shitty infrastructure and management, nothing out of the ordinary.

8. Have you been to [Ortakoy](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Ortak%C3%B6y/@41.0477789,29.0260386,17.79z/data=!4m7!1m4!3m3!1s0x14cab7c8e42887ad:0xfd73f2a29eafc8bc!2sOrtak%C3%B6y+Mosque!3b1!3m1!1s0x14cab7c861d34ff7:0x6f6f552c9c202a4d)? It's not a big area, but both [the square and the mosque](https://c2.staticflickr.com/2/1136/859099925_06c443ddf7_b.jpg) is rather cute, and it's famous for the street food called '[kumpir](https://www.google.com.tr/search?q=kumpir&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CAcQ_AUoAWoVChMIhJSJkobgxwIVC50aCh2PhQ6R&amp;biw=1600&amp;bih=784)' (also waffle places, but kumpir is better). You can go inside the mosque (wait for 20 minutes if a prayer service is in session atm) and watch out the big windows looking over the water. Then, right from the docks in front of the mosque, hop on a ferry tour of the Bosphorus (there are two docks, one near the square, one near the mosque; take the latter). It takes about an hour and should cost something like 10 dollars at most. The boat goes slowly northwards for half an hour on one side, then goes across the strait and comes back to the same place, following the shoreline on the other side.

"cur4jiz","30 fucking years.

30 fucking years I waited for this.

They called my name. I made it, somehow, I made it.

Then, for a stupid pizza oven I didn't even fucking want, my bid was dead on. Bullseye. Everyone else went too low. The price was 2895.00 and my bid was 2800. Then the moron to my left, Zane from Phoenix,  said “2801!” and hooted like the soft skulled “I always open my mouth and look as wacky as possible whenever somebody takes a picture of me!” mongoloid that he is.

The price is fucking right. For Zane. Not for me.

My dream of being on The Price is Right got fucked. The luck that plucked me from the audience and onto the dais turned to garbage. Zane got the pizza oven and a set of bedroom furniture that he and his fellow Arizona State buttheads would ruin by the end of senior year. 

Then he won a brand new car. A giant SUV painted red. I hoped it had a faulty gas tank and would explode, trapping Zane to die as it became a flaming tomb. But that wasn't the worst part. The worst part was the first half showdown. Zane hit 1.00 on his first spin in the showdown and high stepped his way to the endgame with 10k in his pocket.

The first half of the show is prime fucking time. If you make it during the first half, you get to pass on the first showcase. The first showcase is a mess of prizes that are impossible to accurately tie together with one dollar amount. The second showcase is always better and Zane had full veto power. Seeing him afforded even that much authority was enough to make my skin crawl. Drew Carey seemed utterly charmed by Zane's idiocy and I wanted to hit them both with a frying pan.

During the second half, my dream circled the drain in the grand toilet of life. My estimates were close but Zane had jiggered my radar. I felt like the biggest loser on the planet. One lady in a red sweater won a fucking Chevy Volt. Shoot me in the head.

I had one last chance. The prize was a piece of garbage that claimed to be the next coming of the Roku “never need a VCR” movement. I didn't know what it was but knowing it was my last shot at the main stage. That made me fucking rabid. I bid 1600 and went with God for one last hail Mary.

The price: 1626. I was in the fucking game.

That game? Plinko.

For a second, I forgot about Zane. But then I knew my purpose in life: punish that piece of walking meconium. Punish him and ruin his day. Rain on his parade like pissing on a campfire.

The hatred coursed through my veins and I nearly lost control. I had to stay calm. This was Plinko. This was $10,000 up for grabs. One chip on the house and up to four more if I played it cool and stayed in the zone.

I didn't play it cool nor did I stay in the zone. Four prices with one number wrong and I missed 'em all. Drew Carey felt sorry for me. He was a four eyed boob who made Steve Harvey look like Neil Degrasse Tyson but he'd been sentient enough to follow my odyssey. The trite pity in his voice made me want to see him squeezed to death by Temple Grandin's hugbox.

My one Plinko chip dropped down into the zero slot. Of fucking course. Zero. Total wipe out from the total wipe out of a contestant's dream. Some of us win cars; others win a fancy internet box that will totally replace downloading movies and TV shows on the internet. God knows that's going to happen.

With my evolutionary streaming media prize and total Plinko failure in my corner, I waited to spin the wheel. The lady who won the hybrid car got .55 on her first spin and .90 on her second. It took every ounce of good grace in my body to not laugh like a hyena. The second moron got .10 on his first spin and .35 on his second. Way to knock 'em dead, sporto.

Hope began to glow inside me. If these were my opponents, there might have been a bit more to play out. I stood up, took the wheel, and spun. I spun that big wheel as hard as I could. The notion of fighting my way out of purgatory and getting one last shot at Zane fired me up.

The arrow stopped on .05 but came agonizingly close to pulling free from the separator. I nearly hit 1.00 on my first spin and if they didn't have the pegs between the numbers, I would have. But nope. Maybe in fucking Valhalla but not in this world.

My last spin. With my luck, I'd probably hit .25 and lose to the guy that couldn't even crack half a dollar total. I'd be the butt monkey to the end. But I scraped myself together and gave that wheel one spin to end all spins.

I got .90, dead on. A total of .95 and a complete curb stomping of my opponent. I would be seeing my old friend Zane once again, this time in the showcase showdown. Drew Carey in his 87th minute of fame looked at me like I was a double arm amputee trying to box with God. I never realized how much of a treasure Bob Barker really was before then.

Zane passed on the first showcase. A trashy motor home and a load of camping supplies from our good friends at Cabela. A portable hot tub. A motorbike that I hoped came without a helmet. I could kill myself in so many ways with all those prizes and if Zane got the best of me, I just might go through with it.

The second showcase was unreal. A trip to Spain, two jet skis, and a brand new Mustang. Zane reacted to it the same way people did when David Copperfield made the Statue of Liberty disappear. I stewed in hatred and jealousy.

Zane overbid comically. I thought my bid was way too generous but conservative enough to be within range. What kind of idiot wanted such a mess of prizes couldn't be allowed to distract me. Zane seemed to think his bid was “totally money” and I just smiled politely.

The results came in.

Zane went nearly $15k over on his showcase. Knowing that he wouldn't be walking out with two brand new automobiles was comforting. I could go to my grave a restful man after seeing such an utter dullard steal my dream and fuck it all up with his own idiocy.

Drew moved on to me. I stood stock still and smiled politely. Zane was so mystified by not winning that he'd probably try and sue CBS for “cheating”. The thought that he'd be driving home in his giant landcrusher, wondering why those cheating bastards at the game show screwed him over was luscious.

Zane's self-defeat was so delightful that when Drew read the value of my showcase, I didn't really process it. For a second, I thought I'd overbid too and the show would end in an ultimate downer with neither contestant winning the showcase. I didn't really care because Zane's misery had been so satisfying.

Then I heard the crowd roar. The numbers were so similar that it wasn't immediate but once the single “5” popped up on my podium, things made more sense. I had been only five dollars off from the exact price of my showcase. Five dollars off the bottom and it made all the difference.

Zane didn't understand and I didn't give a fuck.

Both showcases were mine. All mine.

"cuquzba","&gt;If I'm riding slower than most folks want to split, should I try to find a place to pull back into traffic to let the splitters past me

**YES**.

 Be observant and check your mirrors, if someone is behind you thats means they've been splitting faster than you for long enough to catch you. Once you find a safe gap in traffic move over into the number 1 lane if possible. It's not too hard to get back into the split, just straddle the lane check your mirror and get back to it. 

&gt;When I was there a couple of years back, I know I saw riders splitting between the two left lanes of traffic in any given direction, but do people split between other lanes?

Please only split between the number 1 and 2 lanes. If there is a carpool lane go ahead and jump in that. those are the lanes where people will be actively looking/expecting bikes to be splitting. If you're splitting in any other lane you're only going to make it harder for yourself. 

* Practice filtering at red lights before you try splitting at speed on the freeway. Our lanes are wide and generous, but it's still a weird sensation when splitting a long row of stopped traffic.

* Look far off into the horizon and use your peripheral vision to spot cars that might come into your lane. If you get sketched out and start staring at cars in your immediate vicinity you **will** clip someones mirror or worse.

* When passing cars while splitting try to do it while the two cars are abreast, you'll have much less of a chance of getting side swiped by a driver changing lanes.

* Lots of people split while traffic is moving at 60mph+, this doesn't mean you have to and it's actually illegal. 

* I like to give drivers a little wave when they see me coming and move over to the other side of their lane. It just shows respect for their consideration. If I can't take my hands off the bars for whatever reason I give them a foot waggle. Again, only do it if you're comfortable and confident that nothing is going to happen.

First off, I wouldn't even say he's taking advantage of his parents. These gifts that they've offered are extravagant and very generous, but they offered them, and they likely instilled in him the understanding that this was acceptable. There's never anything wrong with accepting help that is offered to you, especially in a time of such financial turmoil in one's life. 

Second off, simply because somebody hasn't exersized independence yet doesn't mean he is incapable of it. I moved out from my parents at 17, and learned independence at a fairly early age, but my SO lived at home almost all her life until 24, and when she moved out she adapted quickly, and was more than capable of cleaning bathrooms and cooking. Anything she didn't know (paying certain bills) she was able to pick up quickly.  

Everyone does things differently. I valued my independence, but it cost me dearly. I was living paycheque until I was 25, struggling to pay bills and make rent. I could have made better choices and done better, but independence is expensive. 

My wife went to college for a number of intensive years immediately after high school, and while her parents didn't pay her way through, they let her live with them rent free. She then lived with them for two years while she paid off her student loans and got herself financially situated.
Two years later, she had paid off thirty thousand dollars of student loans, and built up a solid nest egg and then she and I moved in together and fully supported me while I went back to college. Despite all this, she managed to buy a nice home at age 25, and we both live very comfortably. 

This is owed in no small part to her parents gift of room and board, and her decision to accept it until she was 24 years old. This was an excellent financial decision for her, and spring boarded her into success greater than would otherwise be possible. 

Anyway, sorry for the rant. I can simply say that different people adopt different life strategies, and being 22 and living at home isn't anything to be concerned about.

Oh and that PC will last a few years, believe me. When he gets older, he will be smarter and he will know what he wants for himself and most propably will build the PC himself.

#Stop worrying about your credit.

You're $40k in CC debt with other debt stacked on top of it, and instead of paying it down, you want to do all the stuff you should be doing already. It seems like you have an income/spending problem, since you should be saving for retirement and emergency fund already. Fix that first, then worry about what to do with your possible windfall. 

Citi is giving you 30 years to pay back $40k, interest free? That's astounding and generous, but I wouldn't want to be tied to this debt for that long, regardless of the low monthly payment.

If you can settle that for $25k, I would take that option. If you lose your job tomorrow and can't make those $120 payments in 6 months, I guarantee they're going to start charging you interest again and you'll end up with a judgement.

Create a budget, and pay your $3k credit card down before the interest kicks in, and keep it paid off. Put 5-10% of your income towards retirement savings, and another 5-10% towards your emergency fund. 

How are you handling transportation right now? Do you need a car? Do not get a car loan to help your credit. You have plenty of history as it is, and paying off your existing debt will help your credit 100x more than adding more to it anyway.

Then I try to build strengths and weaknesses around that. i.e. this character is generous, but easy to take advantage of. The sister is always supportive, but has started to become a kleptomaniac. His buddy will help him along the journey, but only because he knows there is gold in it for him. 

I also try to look ahead to the end, and what has to change in the protagonist so they can overcome their obstacles. The flaw is usually something they have to overcome in order to beat the bad guy. In other words, hopefully by the end of my story the main character will be beating up the bad guy and taking his stuff.

So, I got him to write me a list of what he really likes, and I offered to do him a list of what I really like.

"cs0dwm4","There has been cases of students only going to university to receive the financial support but it is a small minority and usually they are kicked out after a semester or two if they do not take their exams. In general it is not a big problem (but media likes to bring it up once in a while). There is a another related issue. Danish students have traditionally taken their time completing their degree taxing the system for resources not strictly needed. Today completing a full track BA + MA would in most cases be 5 years but many take more than a year more. This might be due to education being free but there are other likely causes. E.g. a Danish MA student typically has a part time job 10-20 hours a week, both to receive extra income (many are quite independent of parent income) and to get work experience. Until recently, expectations from professors for MA thesis work were high and incentives pushed students to spend more than the 6 months alloted. 

There has been many policy changes that have thought to lower both the time between high school and university and at university in the last two decades. A new law last year (goes into full effect this fall) does more to speed up students, including mandatory class and exam registration (the law has been criticised for being to rigid, which might e.g. increase dropout rate though). Even before this law we have seen improvements but Danish students still graduate later than in many comparable countries.

Regarding dilution, there has been some critique that the large increase in student intake as well as some policy changes in the last decade has contributed  to lowering standards. I am not aware of any study that supports this though. Denmark has 8 official universities and a long list of other schools of higher education. There are strict rules for granting degrees , e.g. schools granting BA/BSC or MA/MSC degrees are required to do research and expose students to research. Degrees are accredited by a government institution that has the power to close degrees if they fail. Schools are also accredited on an institutional level with a with a focus on assuring local quality assurance policies are up to standard. 

Regarding skilled labor, Denmark has a similar system to the German one. Crafts are taught at technical schools that students go to instead of high school. The degree is a mix of classes and paid internships. It takes about 4 years to finish technical school after which graduates either join the labor force or, a minority, continue with further education at speciality schools or university. There's a shortage of internships and this has been the case for quite a while. Technical schools offer students to do internships at the school but this is inferior to a proper internship. I am not an expert but I would say the system is under great pressure at the moment. On top of the internship issue, traditional crafts require more advanced studies while at the same time high schools attract the best and brightest students (and have seen an increase in intake). I'm not sure how big this mismatch in skills is but it has been covered by media.

Edit: 
For a lack of a better place to put this, this will have to do. There has been talks by experts and politicians that we need to do away with the traditional expectation of students competing a full BA + MA track and instead finish with only a BA. Currently, there is a gap in the labor market where graduates either have associates degrees or a ""professional BA"" (3.5 years focused on applied studies, e.g. teaching. No requirement for research-based teaching and thus criticised as low standard). This gap is both due to the generous but expensive educational system but also union-employer labour market agreements that provides incentives for employers to hire mostly MA over BA graduates. One way to change this is to make students pay for an MA and it has been discussed but student so far dismissed by politicians. Some say the policy changes have pushed this discussion much into the future if they solve the issues they are meant to, others say it is the foundation for such a system.

"crzrse7","I've tested games. These over-memed images are mostly BS.

&gt; Basically every video game tester is under an NDA (Non-disclosure Agreement) that basically states that they are not allowed to say anything about the game they are working on. Breaking this is the fastest way to get fired. That is also why this post will be vague and I won't answer any questions about what company or games I have worked on.

Yeah, and I have the same NDA on anything I work on as a tester. This is not unique to the gaming industry.

&gt; Normally, we are supposed to reproduce an issue before we even bother to let anyone know somethings broke. But in this case, the guy destroyed 4-5 consoles before he let anyone know. The consoles had to be sent back to the manufacturer and the guy got in alot of trouble.

/r/thathappened

&gt; Unless a company makes just 1 game, testers will get moved to any project. They like to have a mix of people that know how the game should work, and people that have no clue whats going on in the game. This way if something is off, the new people might catch it where the old people had seen the issue since the first iteration of the game so they didn't do anything about it.

Again, not unique to the gaming industry. Managers place you where you will be useful, not where you want to be necessarily. Sometimes you're placed where you want to be. I rarely worked on the actual game when I was a tester. I mainly tested the website.

&gt; I have seen some of the stereotypical neck-beards at work, but most of the people tend to be ages 18-40 and all races/genders. I have worked with people who are using this as their first job, and people who worked construction and decided their bodies couldn't take the strain anymore. I have worked with under-qualified and overqualified people. Everyone is generally great.

True of most programming and testing gigs. Again, not unique to the game industry.

&gt; Investors want returns and only invest enough money for a game to be developed for a certain amount of time. Wether that is 1 year or 6 years, eventually the money runs out and the game releases with whatever the developers could make in time. That is the main reason for DLC nowadays.

Source? AFAIK most game companies aren't public and don't have investors in the sense you describe.

&gt; Most entry jobs as a tester for the larger companies is contracted for 1 year to 18 months. This is due to multiple legal reasons and so that people have chances to find other jobs / so the companies can get new blood. Once you get experience though, you can get hired full time into the larger company and work until you choose to quit.

I laughed when I read *1 year to 18 months.* Where are you getting this bullshit?

&gt; More time can be spent on the game if less is spent on the testers. The job is simple and requires no higher education. There are chances for promotion, but there is almost no entry barrier into the field. But, its better than flipping burgers for the same amount of money.

Most testing gigs are minimum wage if you have no experience. Some game companies are more generous, but good luck surviving almost anywhere in California at $14/hr or less.

The job is very simple, but companies nowadays hire for culture fit too. You can't just walk into any company with no experience and get the job. You have to have a passion for the game, gaming, and the work involved in testing. What you described isn't how any of this works.

And if you think working in testing for small pay beats working in the service industry for small pay, I invite you to try both. I have. They both suck.

&gt; Whenever a popular game comes out, everyone loses their mind and *cough* *cough* can't come in due to a sudden illness. It's usually not bad until the managers start calling out as well. But the managers are usually smart enough to request the time off beforehand.

People in the game industry are way overworked. When a game is finally out, exhaustion kicks in just after relief. You can account for this if you track how many extra man hours it took to get the game out despite projections for the sprints. This happens in business software companies too, by the way. I repeat, *not specific to the game industry.*

&gt; We got into this field because we like video games and we like money, so we decided to combine them. You may get burnt out on a game or genre if you play it at work, but their are so many genres that we never get bored. But once we play a game for about 1500 hours before its released, please don't ask us to play it at home once its released. not many games can hold you after that long playing it.

This is some weird kind of self-vent. Not every game tester feels that way. For example, employees at Riot Games are frequently seen playing League of Legends in free time on streams and if you visit their office after-hours in the PC bang. They work on the game because they love it, and play it because they love it. YMMV.

&gt; The developers will continue to work once the game is set for Final. They fix all the major issues the game producer finds so that it can be made onto discs/setup for download. But they still have some time before they game launches so they start working on fixing other issues that were found and throw them out as a day one/day zero patch.

Oh, you have to support the game or software you made after it launches? Color me surprised.

My fault for not making that clear; I've been the recipient of cap SRP, not the donor. Originally cap SRP came out of the J3B corp wallet, but a few fair months ago the alliance took over that financial burden.

So while Ekblad may have been 18 when the season started, he is already a beast physically and larger than 80-90% of his peers.

"cqi3k3w","Well, hypothetically, it could depend on whether the knocker is an AUTHENTIC rattlebag or just someone pretending to be one in hopes of more lucrative returns on their begging. In practice, though, either way if a silent beggar comes to your door and silently greets you by rattling an open bag of miscellaneous small possessions, you should invite him or her inside to share a meal, or at least offer them some generous but reasonable gift to put in their bag.

The authentic rattlebags are devotees of a mystery-cult of Charity, all taking specific forms of poverty and silence vows. They are permitted only possessions that are freely given, and may only speak during specific times and places. 

All being Called to the service of Charity, they are all formal members of the Church professions. Although most are simple priests, they do have missionaries, paladins, consecrators, and archivists among them. 

Although it's reasonably obvious that their purpose is to promote charitable attitudes and habits, their exact rules and goals are mysterious by design. The most prosaic explanation for this might be that if they weren't ""mysterious"", everyone would be able to easily tell who they were and know to pretend to be generous when they're around while continuing to be petty jerks the rest of the time, which would obviously undercut their intentions.

It's widely held that those witnessed being kind and helpful to others are often rewarded in some form or another (sometimes blatantly obvious, such as the rattlebag turning out to have some skill or ability to solve some vexing problem that their kindly benefactors have, sometimes just as vague ""luckiness"" or fortuitous coincidences), and those who mistreat them are said to suffer calamities.

Although ordinary beggars sometimes use this approach to try to maximize their handouts, they aren't usually known to be cursed or otherwise harmed so long as they're ""legitimate"" beggars, but there are a few gruesome stories about miscreants trying to use this ruse for thefts and assassinations and such.

The type of person that wouldn't let most people near him. He actually introduced himself to me and he also told me why: because I was always nice and generous to the hotel personnel. It was at a time when I was completely down and out yet somehow I still managed to be nice to everybody. So I guess the moral of the story is to be generous but to also be selective as to who you let near you. You've been generous to your parents for years but it's time to apply that second rule to them. Don't let them near you any longer because they are not willing to learn and thus will keep poisoning your environment and circle of friends until there is nothing left.

"cp172s4","I went to high school almost 20 years ago and even then it cost around $3-$5 a day if you wanted to eat in the cafeteria with food and drink. 20 years ago. 

In fact, I think I got $20 a week from my mom to eat and I'll admit this was generous but still reasonable as it gave me a little pocket change too. Is food now free at public schools or something?

Also, I've worked in many restaurants as a cook. The only reason I ate for free was because I stole basically, and could sneak food in the back whenever I wanted. Nowhere I worked let employees eat for free. The most discount employees would receive that I ever saw, was getting half off of one meal either just before, or right after a shift. Most people think working at a restaurant = free food. It is quite the opposite actually. Besides, even if she gets a discount your assumption she could eat there cheaper then going to the grocery or the $1 menu at a fast food place is probably wrong. She could work at a fine dining restaurant for all we know.

I'm glad you can eat for $100 a month, but most people can't. I can't even eat for $100 a week personally, but admittedly I eat out often and like quality food versus cheap.

Again, you say most places are around $600 a month with utilities? You don't live where I do and you generalize way too much.

"copbmoy","Most servers are required to 'tip out' the house, usually between 4-7% of their sales. If a table does not tip anything, it actually just cost the server money. While it does not happen often, if it happens with a large group the amount can be quite large, thus the auto-grat is here justified. On a 2k bill at 7% (not uncommon group amount in this town), that's 140 dollars the server has to 'tip' back to the restaurant, regardless of how much the actual tip is. It should be illegal to work an entire night and be out of pocket at the end of it, but unfortunately it's not. It's a shady unregulated industry as a whole.
Now, an honest word about Valentine's from a long time server who's since left the industry. Valentine's Day Sucks. Period. The worst night to work all year. Remember when I said it isn't often that people don't tip, or even undertip? That's true 363 nights a year. Calgary is a great town and most people are fair and generous. But not on Valentines. So many awkward tables, resentful partners who clearly don't want to be there and unmet expectations, tears, failed marriage proposals, rants about our wine prices, you name it and I've seen it, mostly on Valentine's. Now that I'm out of the industry, I avoid it like the plague. All that being said, I can understand some restaurants charging an auto-grat on a special table d'hôte style menu for that one evening. Sorta like a cover charge for New Year's Eve. 
As for 'fancy' places. Here's the truth, and you won't like it. They know the majority of their clientele on Valentine's are not their regular customers. I've worked in some of the top end restaurants in this city, and the people you see on Valentines are not the people you see every other night. They are people who go to places like this once a year, maybe twice. Otherwise they go to the big chains, BP with the kids, the Keg, usually in the suburbs and closer to home. 
All that being said, you should be getting the same level of service any fat cat gets on any night there. Your server failed in telling you about the auto-grat, and the restaurant also should have mentioned it when you made your reservation. It should have also been printed on your menu. However they know you probably won't really being coming back anyways. I can't imagine this being a thing the rest of the year. No where I've worked auto-grats deuces, just eights or more. I've also never seen a manager refuse to take off that gratuity when challenged about bad service, since it's usually no loss to the restaurant, just the server. You should have spoken to the manager, not your waiter. Waiters in general  are not supposed to discuss tips, only inform you one is there, any disputes are always referred to the management. There are dubious servers out there as well. They are often hoping to get double-tipped in not mentioning it.
Next time simply excuse yourself from the table/your date, go to the hostess stand and ask to speak to a manager. It is the discreet, non awkward way to deal with the situation.

"cnwe7du","Tumblr's greatest strength is that it can give a home to the disenfranchised. If some fat people want to get together to make each other feel better in a world that feels full of fat-hate, then sure, whatever they want. Just like if thin people want to get together to feel better about being very thin or as a retreat from the current hatred for women with small butts, than okay, whatever makes them feel better. I don't see any real harm, though, because as a fat person, that's a teeny tiny piece of acceptance in a big world of ""HOLY SHIT YOU'RE FAT, WHICH MEANS YOU'RE WORTHLESS, UGLY, STUPID, AND INCONVENIENT, WE HATE YOU AND HOPE YOU DIE..."" etc. 

I appreciate that people are actually starting to show proof that surprise, calling me a fat worthless piece of shit doesn't magically spur me to lose weight. It's frustrating that there's so much hatred for fat people - I know plenty of people who are overweight, but they are good people, people who work so hard for other people that they barely have time to take care of themselves. People who are kind and loving and caring and generous. But none of that matters because they are fat. Because they're fat, they are disgusting. They're lower than shit...because people don't like how they look. And that's stupid and wrong and it sucks, but we can't change how people think. And I don't think the FA movement understands that. 

The Fat Acceptance movement is linked to the Health At Any Size (HAES) movement, but I feel that the two share only a passing relation. I always saw FA as being a ""we will fight for the rights of fat people everywhere!"", which is weird to me, because as a fat person, I don't know that I've been overtly denied any specific rights. Perks, maybe, but nothing that I am otherwise legally entitled to. I always saw HAES as a recommendation that, no matter what the number on the scale is, you owe it to your body to treat it well with exercise and healthful eating. Basically, be the healthiest you can be at whatever weight you are at. If you lose weight, then awesome. But that's not the main goal, because weight in and of itself is one of many markers for health. This keeps me exercising even when I don't see movement on the scale. It gives me motivation when I might otherwise just give up. 

I appreciate the fact that it's getting easier to find clothes in larger sizes. There is statistical data that suggests that fat people are somewhat discriminated against in the job market. There is scientific data that the low fat/high carb dieting craze that the medical world still largely espouses (when I was in nursing school, that's what I was taught) is crap. There is statistical, scientific and anecdotal evidence that size is heavily influenced by genetics and hormones in a way that can greatly affect weight gain and loss, making it more complicated than just calories-in-calories-out. But do I think there needs to be a movement to make being fat more acceptable? Not for me, really, but hey, if it helps some people who are at their lowest point to feel good enough about themselves to try to get healthier, than great. Why fight that?

"cnvpbeq","thank you for the reasoned response; it's good to see you acknowledging some accountability.

here's the thing - when you're the person on the lease or mortgage and are allowing someone to live with you, there's usually a huge measure of obligation and resentment involved in it.  honestly, even if you guys were PERFECT (which honestly it doesn't sound like you are), she would likely find issues.  this is because it's really difficult to have 'interlopers' invading your space, even if they're family and you love them and you want to help, and as a result, every little thing they do gets on your last fucking nerve.  so that's a good portion of your sister's psychology, right there.  further complicating it might be what you intimated to someone else, re you having the baby and her terming her pregnancies, but the thing is, that's neither here nor there.

the bottom line is this -

your sister is doing you a huge favor which apparently no one else in your family was willing or able to do.  in doing that favor, she's sacrificing her privacy and her space, which is something you'll understand far more when you have your OWN nest.  as a teenage girl who has never lived on her own, it's understandable that you don't get it, but i promise you in a few years when you've got your own place, you'll have a new respect for exactly what your sister is going through right now.  especially if you're in a position ever to do the same thing for someone else that she's doing for you right now.

her personal lifestyle choices are neither your concern nor a justification for ill-behavior on your part.  if she throws her laundry around and doesn't do her own dishes, that's cool, because it's her place.  if she cheats on her boyfriend, that's not cool, but again, it's her place and she gets to do whatever she wants and if you didn't live there you wouldn't even be privy to it, most likely.  as for her abortions, beyond any psychology you think might be manifesting here, they are not your concern.  et cetera.  the point is, it's her home.  she can live however she wants.

you, however, cannot, and i realize that probably sounds unfair, but again - her home.

my best advice to you is this:

toe the line with your classes.  if you don't have a job, get one.  insist that your boyfriend pay his share of rent, no matter what.  clean up after yourselves.  take care of your daughter.  if she is working full time, which i presume she is, then do extra shit around the house.  wash her dishes too - if you and your boyfriend are only working part time, then that onus does fall upon you, and yeah, you have a kid to look after as well while she doesn't, but that was your call, not hers.  if it were me, i'd be trying to make as tiny a footprint as possible, while being as generous and grateful as possible.  you might find that her petty remarks will decrease when she comes home at night and finds the baby happily in bed, the dishes and laundry done, the floor swept, and no weird people milling about.  she might soften and become more generous.

but this, as it is, has been reduced to a battle of wills - her feeling like she's giving you everything and you're ungrateful and demanding in spite of it, and you feeling like you're being treated like a child and a second class citizen.  thing is, the onus is on YOU to try to correct the balance, because - and this is important - you are a GUEST IN HER HOME.  not only you, but TWO ADDITIONAL PEOPLE YOU'VE BROUGHT INTO IT.  

so try to be more understanding, and more accommodating, even if that occasionally feels like you're eating shit in order to do so.

again, if you don't like it, the solution is to move out and do it on your own. you do have choices here.  but you don't get to live in her house and then demand things on your terms.  that's not how life works.

good luck to you.

",1421812175,"thank you for the reasoned response; it's good to see you acknowledging some accountability.  here's the thing - when you're the person on the lease or mortgage and are allowing someone to live with you, there's usually a huge measure of obligation and resentment involved in it.  honestly, even if you guys were perfect (which honestly it doesn't sound like you are), she would likely find issues.  this is because it's really difficult to have 'interlopers' invading your space, even if they're family and you love them and you want to help, and as a result, every little thing they do gets on your last fucking nerve.  so that's a good portion of your sister's psychology, right there.  further complicating it might be what you intimated to someone else, re you having the baby and her terming her pregnancies, but the thing is, that's neither here nor there.  the bottom line is this -  your sister is doing you a huge favor which apparently no one else in your family was willing or able to do.  in doing that favor, she's sacrificing her privacy and her space, which is something you'll understand far more when you have your own nest.  as a teenage girl who has never lived on her own, it's understandable that you don't get it, but i promise you in a few years when you've got your own place, you'll have a new respect for exactly what your sister is going through right now.  especially if you're in a position ever to do the same thing for someone else that she's doing for you right now.  her personal lifestyle choices are neither your concern nor a justification for ill-behavior on your part.  if she throws her laundry around and doesn't do her own dishes, that's cool, because it's her place.  if she cheats on her boyfriend, that's not cool, but again, it's her place and she gets to do whatever she wants and if you didn't live there you wouldn't even be privy to it, most likely.  as for her abortions, beyond any psychology you think might be manifesting here, they are not your concern.  et cetera.  the point is, it's her home.  she can live however she wants.  you, however, cannot, and i realize that probably sounds unfair, but again - her home.  my best advice to you is this:  toe the line with your classes.  if you don't have a job, get one.  insist that your boyfriend pay his share of rent, no matter what.  clean up after yourselves.  take care of your daughter.  if she is working full time, which i presume she is, then do extra shit around the house.  wash her dishes too - if you and your boyfriend are only working part time, then that onus does fall upon you, and yeah, you have a kid to look after as well while she doesn't, but that was your call, not hers.  if it were me, i'd be trying to make as tiny a footprint as possible, while being as generous and grateful as possible.  you might find that her petty remarks will decrease when she comes home at night and finds the baby happily in bed, the dishes and laundry done, the floor swept, and no weird people milling about.  she might soften and become more generous.  but this, as it is, has been reduced to a battle of wills - her feeling like she's giving you everything and you're ungrateful and demanding in spite of it, and you feeling like you're being treated like a child and a second class citizen.  thing is, the onus is on you to try to correct the balance, because - and this is important - you are a guest in her home.  not only you, but two additional people you've brought into it.    so try to be more understanding, and more accommodating, even if that occasionally feels like you're eating shit in order to do so.  again, if you don't like it, the solution is to move out and do it on your own. you do have choices here.  but you don't get to live in her house and then demand things on your terms.  that's not how life works.  good luck to you.","generous and grateful","generous",NA,FALSE,"generous and grateful","grateful",NA,NA,1

"cmsrodc","One of our best 'friends' (i.e. most loyal contacts - and contact that *we* were the most loyal to) in Shadowrun was a toxic shaman of Death. It worked very well - we weren't very sociopathic, but he could couch whatever he wanted to do in terms we could understand, and he did exactly what he said he would do.

Depending on your setting, there can be several solutions to this. In DragonLance, for instance, **Evil Always Turns On Itself**. It's one of the axioms of the setting. In my games, **Evil Can Have Friends Too**. It's one of *my* axioms in almost *any* game.

Also, if she's loyal in the sense that she does *not* try to screw them over, answers 'yes' on direct questions on whether she's evil-aligned (*""Yes, I would detect as evil to a paladin because of things I've done. I'm not proud of them, but I will not pretend otherwise either.""*), and so on, she may become one of the group's friends - if you so desire. It's how you shape the narrative, particularly early, that will decide this. Running with her being trustworthy, honest, and generous - but yes, evil - will go a long way towards her being a valued NPC.

A few of my own player characters have been evil aligned, and have been quite upfront with that to the rest of the group - without going into detail on *why* I was 'tainted'.

(In one case, it was because I was heavily on the side of the means to an end being irrelevant as compared to the end - that kind of ruthlessness is either LE or NE (or rarely CE), depending on the nature of the goal, and the general sociopathy of the character.)

I would be heavy on the ""Truth in the eye of the beholder"" part of the narrative. Telling about how Relis the god managed to twist the narrative, and so forth, and how important it is to bring revengeance to your enemies, should tell them pretty soon how it is.

It should also be clear pretty early that she's into necromancy, and can help them with corpsegrafts if they get damaged - perhaps a side quest might be to find her the raw materials to save an ailing NPC that the local, 'good' healing priests won't help?

*""I need a ghoul as intact as possible, the hand of a ghast, fourteen zombie fingerbones, and perhaps the head of a juju zombie. Remember, no turning or positive energy attacks! I need the necromantic energies ... unsullied.""*

I wouldn't use Kul as a flesh golem - I would use it as a unique construct. Golem is such a ... laden term. Other than that, the mannerisms of Kul sounds pretty interesting, and I'll probably ~~rip off~~ pay homage to your idea in one of my games, if I remember it.

Also, don't go completely Dexter with her, but remember to keep her victims unsympathetic. If she starts sacrificing orphans, she's likely to end up on the party's kill list. If she consistently goes after Relis priests that are neutral or evil, and are unequivocally bastards in various ways, she is much more likely to come across as more sympathetic.",1418389340,"running with her being trustworthy, honest, and generous - but yes, evil - will go a long way towards her being a valued npc.","honest, and generous","generous",NA,TRUE,"honest , and generous","honest",NA,NA,0
"cmnuwlg","**God’s Angry Man** Directed by Werner Herzog (1981)- Herzog’s short documentary about a strange and interesting televangelist. He seems very easy to peg down early on, he seems like the rest of these guys. He seems desperate for money and is exploiting the fact that some Christians are generous and easy to make feel guilty for not being generous. But as the film goes on how we perceive him and who exactly he is becomes more and more unclear. He’s surprisingly candid and kind of presents himself as a man who doesn’t really want to be a priest but is doing so because he has to. His father was a preacher and his Church is in dire need of help. All of this is vague enough for it to be called into question but delivered so earnestly that I can buy into it. I could believe this man is the tortured soul with a cross to bear that he presents himself as or I could believe he’s a greedy egotistic guy. For the first half I was interested but not swept away as in other Herzog films but then something amazing happens and it’s all good from there. About halfway through the film is one of the funniest and most nightmarish cuts I’ve ever seen. Without ever commenting on anything Herzog’s perception of everything is often clear. He sees and brings out the absurdist side of the preachers show and in one glorious cut we see it all. We watch one of the musical guests sing and we slowly move in on him. He’s a good singer but has a little too much make-up on and has an air of oddness. As he goes on we get more pulled in to his song though. As he starts to wind down it cuts to a woman’s face, mouth agape, singing a whole new part of the song. There’s just a sudden rush of clashing sounds that all seem to be coming out of her maw at once. It was so funny that my friend and I watched it several times. It was like those moments in a Tim and Eric sketch where the audio of someone is layered over itself so many times that it becomes a bizarre shriek more than a sentence or song.  There were a couple of very Tim and Eric-y moments amidst an intriguing documentary. The only real complaint was that Herzog speaks over most of what people say. Sometimes news stations do this where someone will be speaking in a foreign accent but it gets drowned out by someone saying what they’re saying in English. That’s essentially what happens here but it’s him saying it in German over the other guy talking. It’s not at the same pace and the guy isn’t quite drowned out so it can be a little frustrating because the ear’s catching some of what he says while having to make sure I read the subs as I won’t hear it all. Other than that it was a good little film. Not as excellent as his other shorts like The Great Ecstasy of Woodcarver Steiner but good all the same. 

**Cold Fish** Directed by Shion Sono (2010)- Shion Sono always delivers something interesting but for the first time he hasn’t totally gripped me. I’ve only seen Why Don’t You Play in Hell?, Love Exposure, and Suicide Squad, but this was by far my least favourite watch. Early on it is excellent, every single encounter has so much mystery to it that what people want and who they are is always suspect. Characters are almost as broad as sitcom characters in some ways but shot with a very straight way. It gives it the same heightened drama of Love Exposure but in more of a Fincher-y aesthetic. As it goes on though these mysteries wane and the sense that anything could happen disappears. At a certain point it becomes clear where things are going and then they do, with little to really shake things up. Later moments in the film still have great stuff in them, particularly when it follows the method of a serial killer. But it ends up repeating itself a few times. Sono balances humour and grimness well as usual but it feels disappointingly familiar compared to his incredibly distinct other films. If you’re into dark thrillers of this ilk it is very good but it’s hardly the best of the bunch and a more minor film in an excellent filmography. 

**Stonehearst Asylum** Directed by Brad Anderson (2014)- This was the first film The Dissolve gave an “Essential Viewing” tag that I hadn’t even heard of (looking now though it seems that tag has been removed which is weird). To boot it stars Jim Sturgess, Kate Beckinsale, Ben Kingsley, Michael Caine, David Thewlis, Brendan Gleeson, and Jason Flemyng. That’s a great cast for the most part, plus it’s directed by Brad Anderson who did Session 9 and The Machinist (films I don’t love but have some good bits). The film takes the plot of a Poe short and uses its entirety as set-up rather than the whole influence. Dr Edward Newgate, a young alienist in training, heads to the titular Asylum but finds that those in charge could be crazier than those locked up. Early on some things are clear but it plays with what we know in fun ways. Stonehearst Asylum is a straight gothic tale like we rarely see nowadays. Even though it has its failings it also feels a lot more nuanced and sophisticated than one might assume. No where is this more noticed in the performances of people like Kingsley and Caine. In recent years it seems like they’ve been relegated to playing a lot of the same parts; the vaguely ethnic voice of authority and the wise old gent respectively. Dotted about they’ve had other good things but I often feel whenever I see either in a film today that I wish they had more to do. Both of them here actually get characters to play with moral complexity. Neither is just one thing and it’s sad how refreshing that is to see. Even Beckinsale, an actress who often has a moment or more during any performance that is glaringly bad, really captures her character. The film has interesting perspectives on mental illness too, and one that never feels too lopsided. It’s not just a film set in the past so they can revel in the barbarism of past mental illness treatment and feel superior. Instead the film tackles the entire approach to mental health in general and not just in ways that are critical of the time in particular. It’s not a perfect film, I imagine it could have made my top ten had it been a bit more visually inventive and had the chilling/tense moments properly landed, but it really is great in some ways. I have a penchant for the gothic anyway so I think it’s a film I’d dig anyway but it feels a lot better than it could have been. As it’s set in an Asylum with Ben Kingsley I couldn’t help think of Shutter Island and it kind of points out the flaws in this and I think it’s direction. Shutter Island has more of an atmosphere and can be quite effecting but I think Stonehearst has a more complex and interesting script. Some of this could be budget restraints but it does feel like an even better director could’ve made this something excellent. As it is it’s still really good though.  

**The African Queen** Directed by John Huston (1951)- Katherine Hepburn and Humphrey Bogart sail down a river in Africa (as the credits say) to attack a warship to aid the WWI war effort. They’re not soldiers but she’s set on doing it because they ostensibly can. Hepburn was a near perfect example of how modern Hollywood gets the idea of the strong female protagonist so wrong. Hepburn plays such a strong woman, but she also plays a woman that feels real. She’s not just the “get it done” type she is at times and neither is she the “reckless thrill seeker” she is in others. Every positive attribute she conveys seems to be singled out to make the entirety of most “strong female characters”. But there’s so much more to her. She can be fierce when facing down Nazi’s and loving dangerous rapids yet still show intense emotion when upset. Most of these types of characters feel more like single attribute robots so this was refreshing. I had a lot of fun with this film, but not a great deal more. Part of why I was excited to see it was because Powell &amp; Pressburger’s cinematographer for some of their best work, Jack Cardiff, shot it. Due to this it looked beautiful much of the time, very glad to have the blu-ray, but I couldn’t help think that it often looked so much more conventional than some of his other work. Having been so blown away by some of his images I couldn’t help feel like some of this looked just like many other 50’s films except for the setting. At times though his unique eye gets to shine through. For the most part I simply found it a very fun film. Not a masterpiece but a good time for sure. 

**Bram Stoker’s Dracula (Re-watch)** Directed by Francis Ford Coppola (1992)- Man do I love this movie. As mentioned I dig the gothic and Coppola makes it as grand as possible here. On previous viewings I’d found Winona Ryder as bad as Reeves but now I’m finally coming around to her. She actually worked for me a bit better than Anthony Hopkins even if he’s funnier. I’m not really gonna defend the film because I can understand why some people might not care for it but it is my jam. For me this is one of the best Dracula films alongside Herzog’s Nosferatu. I love the in-camera effects, all of the costumes, and the insane scale of it at times. There’s some camp in there too that can turn some of the parts that work less well as the grandly romantic and gothic into something that’s at least entertaining. Most Tom Waits performances win me over to something too and Renfield’s one of his most iconic. Coppola is unabashedly just doing what he wants to do and I love it.

* Our infrastructure is starting to fail due to 40 years of neglect (rail is overpopulated and constantly breaking)
* Our armed forces are in great need of... basically everything, they've had their budget constantly slashed during the last 15-20 years (it's currently 1/3 of what it used to be and our immigration costs are more than twice as high as the defense budget, and that's not counting foreign aid that is about the same as the defense budget)
* The schools don't have enough money to properly pay the teachers and 50% of the high school teachers aren't even licensed for the subject they are teaching
* Our healthcare system is on the brink of collapse due to funding issues, waiting times are long, hospitals have to shut down whole sections during summer because they can't replace the people going on vacation and nurses are constantly overworked (and escaping to Norway where they pay is about twice as high), the situation for mental healthcare is even worse
* There are basically no apartments (unless you look in the middle of nowhere, where nobody lives anymore except old people because there are no jobs)
* Unemployment is high, especially for unqualified work

You are saying that even though we have all of these problems, expensive problems, we can help all the people that come here and give them what they need? We have 1.9% of the population in the EU but accepted 22% of the asylum seekers. Even the UNHCR has stated that our levels of commitment are unreasonable. We don't even have the resources to integrate the ones that are already here and we constantly rank badly in the OECD integration statistics. Right now, there are small villages in the middle of nowhere, seeing their population triple in a year because it's the only place where there is ""room"" available. People from war torn countries are being placed miles into the forest, having to walk to the bus in the middle of hunting season. 18 people per toilet, six people per 12 sqm room, in old buildings that were previously considered for demolition, because that's the best accommodation the immigration services can find. Please tell me how this is supposed to work?

&gt;Are there structures in place that allow people to learn the language? So someone gamed the system. If they were not from an immigrant family it would be better?

All education is free. All immigrants have a legal right to language education and are offered a cash bonus for completing the basic course within a certain time. The time limit is quite generous but many people who take the courses don't do it seriously. Since many of them live in areas with more immigrants than Swedish people, and many of them don't work, they don't feel the need to learn Swedish. Because they have minimal contact with the native population they and their children don't learn the local customs. They become a separate society, with a separate culture and separate values (that sometimes don't mix well with the local ones).

&gt;You have to look at how you interact with people before you judge their behavior. Even if they can't speak the language well, there are a loy more people trying than aren't.

This is generally true. Notice that I haven't mentioned the minority that commit the most of the violent crimes (nor the attacks on ambulances, fire trucks or the burning of cars). Before this I only mentioned that we even approve visas for people that commit crimes while they wait for the results of the application process.

&gt;I haven't said anything about anyone being racist. But people want to assume that if only highly educated immigrants come and quietly suffer discrimination from the locals that things would be better.

We actually have a lot of positive experience with highly educated immigrants. That was the dominant type of immigration before the 90's. In my experience there is more racism and discrimination within immigrant groups than from the outside. One thing that I find interesting is that I've heard from several highly educated immigrants that they are leaving the country because it feels like they are less wanted than the uneducated refugees (we give the refugees a lot of support even though they payback is minimal, while we in comparison barely help the highly educated, effectively keeping them out of the job market).

&gt;I'd suggest you listen to the stories of the immigrants themselves. Taken in what they have experienced and then make your decision.

Oh I have. I went to a school with around 50% immigrants and usually got along better with them than with many Swedes. Even now around half of my friends are immigrants and I'm living together with my immigrant girlfriend. A Lebanese friend recently almost started crying with frustration while we were discussing what is currently happening. The only party that wants to limit immigration actually has a stronger backing among immigrant males than among Swedes. The people that live close to the areas where most of the immigrants end up also tend to lean more strongly towards a reduction in new arrivals. It's almost as if the people who live closest to the problems see them more clearly and vote accordingly.",1417482415,"the time limit is quite generous but many people who take the courses don't do it seriously.","generous but many","generous","but",FALSE,"quite generous but many","many","quite",NA,1
"cmgotqk","Actually she is trying to repeat something that actually has merit, but the argument is too watered down at this point to be sensible. Patriarchy simply means that men hold social/political power, at least as a whole, and thus have the means to create a system that benefits men more than it benefits women. To some extent giving men social/political/economic power makes it easier for men to keep that power, but where men benefit (especially in terms of holding economic and political power) in some areas that does not mean that they benefit in all areas.

The price that men pay to be considered the stronger/more capable sex (inherent bias versus purposeful bias is important to consider here; if all other things are equal people will hire and promote a man over a woman, especially if both are married) is that they have to maintain that facade, and maintaining that facade is emotionally draining to such an extent that men who are suicidal and depressed often don't seek out support. To some extent we treat both sexes as their ideals. Men are strong and tough and stoic and providers while women are nurturing and emotional and gentle and generous. The idea of demolishing gender roles is reasonable (men shouldn't be expected to be emotionless/strong/capable and women shouldn't be expected to always be kind/polite/generous), but the issue is that both have to be deconstructed for society to be equal. It's not okay for *either* men or women to hijack a topic from suicide to rape (unless the topic was already people who commit suicide due to rape but I digress) because they aren't related. It doesn't help anyone.

The world is beginning to open up for women. Right now women might not have the means/social support to be equal to men in terms of economics, politics, and even social standing, but the world is beginning to accept women in positions of power and women as capable in STEM fields. There is still much work to be done in those cases (we should not be asking CEOs how they balance motherhood... it really doesn't matter and we don't ask male CEOs that), but we also need to work on accepting stay-at-home fathers alongside accepting female CEOs.

Patriarchy only means that men hold the power. It does not mean men are cruel or evil or inherently hold power. It just means that, as a whole, men hold more power than women. Just look at demographics among CEOs, Congress, etc. and that becomes apparent, but men holding more power does not mean that life is easier for men. It is easier for men to gain power, but that does not mean that men do not have problems that stem from the expectation that men hold power or should hold power.",1417320056,"men are strong and tough and stoic and providers while women are nurturing and emotional and gentle and generous.","gentle and generous","generous",NA,FALSE,"gentle and generous","gentle",NA,NA,0

Graeme awoke screaming. The first thing that hit him was the raging hangover, such an unfamiliar experience, so long had it been since he had been drinking with his brother or anyone else for that matter. The second thing was the realisation that he had once again been dreaming of their first real battle aboard this station. The memory dug into his mind like a drill and he needed to do something to drown it out. Grabbing a glass of water from the table in his room he headed out to the room he and his fellow humans have jokingly nicknamed the playroom. 

As he entered the room he took stock of the items arrayed around him, in one corner of the room were half a dozen suits of medieval plate armour crafted out of whatever damaged hull plating he had managed to scrounge. Along side it was the dozen swords he had constructed as well has his beloved springald. He briefly walked over to the machine that he personally called ""fuck musket"" after Jennifer had told him  ""The aliens are scared of us enough as it is you're not building a fucking musket"". Sitting down and nursing his hangover with another swig of water Graeme suddenly had an epiphany and knew exactly what he wanted to build.

---

As Luke woke up he could hear hammering and welding emanating from the ""playroom"" and immediately knew that Graeme was keeping himself distracted to keep his mind from dwelling on the horrors he had seen the hunters inflict. 
Leaving his quarters as quietly as he can to avoid waking jennifer he heads straight to the playroom. Entering the workshop he seats himself a far enough from Graeme as to give him space to work. ""So if you wanna talk, I ain't exactly a busy person these days"".

Graeme remains mute and continues working on his latest project, attempting to bend the piece of copper pipe he had scrounged into a rough helix shape.

""So what, you making?""

As Graeme silently continues to work on his project Luke looks around the room to see what else is new. After a few seconds of analysing the newest additions to the room he looks at Graeme in surprise  ""Are you making a still?""

Looking up from his work Graeme stares silently for a moment ""The brainless psychopath act fools the aliens, but I really ought to be ashamed that I let it fool me too. Yeah it's a still, now there's no way I'm letting you play therapist but if you want to be useful I still need a couple of things.""

Luke breaks into a grin ""And here was me thinking its been so long since Earth you all thought I have brain damage."" Just glad his friend is talking to him and no longer withdrawn ""What do you need? But don't think you're getting out of talking about this, don't have to be me and don't have to be today but it needs talking about, it's not good for you.""

Ignoring Luke's last comment Graeme replies ""I still need a thermometer and if the damn things in alien some way to translate it to centigrade. Also something to distill though I suspect it will need us to dip into our savings"".

The four humans were technically non-sentient under Dominion law and as such their legal status was little more than pets. However commander Gal'orn, who was perfectly aware that the easier he made their lives the more inclined the humans would be to do what he asked of them, saw fit to provide them with a generous but entirely unofficial stipend in addition to their already costly food and lodging. While the humans had been extremely glad to suddenly have disposable income and a roof over their heads after such a long time begging, they had quickly realised that such things were a novelty and had resolved to avoid spending wherever possible electing instead to scrounge whenever possible. On several occasions that had simply amounted to raiding the equivalent of a skip when the station crew attempted to repair the damage from the latest Hunter raid, though whenever they needed something less easily come dy they had also noticed a small smiling human can be an incredibly persuasive entity indeed.

---

As it turned out Luke had little difficulty in acquiring a thermometer that their translation units could understand. Though he had to sit still while Sunlight examined his still healing injuries as well as a blood test for lingering ethanolic poisons, he had managed to limp out of the med bay with what he wanted. Unfortunately the beverage to distill proved much more challenging.

Eventually Luke and Graeme had given up trying to find anything on the station that was alcoholic in the quantities they required and contacted a wholesaler on the galactic market. Unfortunately for the duo, while the crew of the station had grown accustomed to unusual activities from the humans and so turned a blind eye, Jennifer caught them moving the rather large containers of beverage into the play room.

"clqee0j","Here is a graph for how the percentages changed over time by reward tier. This may be more effective at illustrating the problem.  
http://i.imgur.com/1o02uPT.png  

I've noticed on many campaigns that over time the backer percentage by reward tier will stabilize. The final hours can cause it to shift if the goal hasn't been met because people start upgrading their pledges more. This is why RNG can be used with weightings to try to simulate a campaign to gradually refine it like smoothing the aerodynamics of a race car. You could have more and more backers, but those weightings don't seem to drastically change relative to each other unless the rewards are drastically changed. This partly has to do with how variations in populations often follow a bell curve. There was the drop in the percentages for the $250 tier because that tier slowed down a lot after launch. That just indicates passionate returning fans. There was the gradual decline in the $15 tier's percentage of backers, but it actually wasn't much of a change overall. These weightings seem to be a bit independent of momentum until one gets to the largest priced tiers. The percentages for backers are more important because that graph is less influenced by the four $10,000 tier backers. To me the $20, $30 and $40 tiers look like there is a chunk of backers missing because they instead were drawn to the $15 tier.  

The majority of backers do sit in the lower end of the rewards structure which is **why those rewards are so important** for covering funding distance. That is not abnormal behaviour for consumers. Both Asylum and The Cases of Charles Dexter Ward graph's suffered in that same range from what I see as too many early-bird slots influencing backer behaviour. I really do see the early-bird as a big problem on a campaign that executed many other things very well. You needed about another $80,000 to get into a position where a final week surge would be more likely to succeed. That would have been over 1,000 backers. If you calculated a conversion rate of views into backers you could estimate how much more marketing may be required to fill that gap. Something to note is the more backers, the more potential for a stronger last 48 hours surge.  

It is not about waiting for the early-bird to be filled. From my data observations the action to take would have been setting the remaining number of slots to zero to stem the loss in funding an early-bird tier can create in the Kickstarter trough. Many campaigns have suffered from this problem. That action does not guarantee success, but it leaving the early-bird tier open **reduces the chances for success**. It was not just the extra $5 gained for a $20 backer versus a $15 backer. It is about getting those middle priced reward tiers growing better. It is about getting the backer percentage for the medium priced reward tiers to start improving over time. Project creators may think backers are generous, but most are still acting in self-interest factoring in value for their money and shopping around other active projects. A project that gets to 75% funded with 500 backers could potentially get to 100% with the same 500 backers if the rewards are more efficient. Large projects cannot depend too much on large backers.  

""The low-average pledge we've been seeing these days"" is something I have not seen mentioned before. To me it has actually been going up due to more $15 priced games running now than $10 priced games. I could speculate projects are getting more ambitious over time. In hindsight many 2011 campaigns did not ask for nearly enough due to taxes. The average pledge per backer amount is going to **arise on a project by project basis**. I see the pricing of the reward tier that introduces a copy of the game as an important determining factor. I do not see it as tied to Kickstarter's platform itself. A healthy project with a $5 priced game may see an average of $10 to $20 per backer. Observing this was the reason I needed to develop a weightclassing system to more accurately compare campaigns. There is such a thing as an average pledge amount that is too low. That is more tied to the size of the project's goal, how inefficient per backer its rewards are, if the game looks bad and if it is failing to up-sell backers to the medium or high priced rewards. This is much rarer than having an average pledge amount that is too high. Even bad campaigns can get relatives contribute a few thousand dollars at launch.  

Extrapolation is good. It is one of the steps I use when planning an early-bird reward (One of the hardest parts in the whole process). I also have the following step be to identify if the early-bird slots are too many. It is difficult to recommend over 1,000 slots for a campaign that isn't in the superstar weightclass. I see the new time-limited rewards that are appearing (They end before the campaign even gets near the trough stage), or having the introductory tier always include a discount are becoming safer strategies. On a side note, after the first week of data it can be good to then use projections to decide how far the stretch goals with span. That way a project can have stretch goals it might actually reach and avoid showing stretch goals so large they look overambitious.  

Including failed and successful campaigns, the per backer average pledge in the Video Games category looks around $40 to $50. The popular successful campaigns are getting enough backers to dilute their average down below that. Unsuccessful campaigns can have very large per backer average pledge amounts and are pulling the average up for the category. A low average pledge amount **can indicate a project is getting backers more frequently which means it has good momentum**. A high per backer average pledge is **not something I would recommend aiming for** as a metric of success. Higher averages are often an indicator of lack of project exposure. I look at the number of backers as the best metric because so many other observations then follow.  

The pricing of the main rewards was good. Again, the existence of early-bird slots warps backer behaviour by effectively increasing the price of those next rewards by the amount saved by the discount. The $30 tier effectively became a $35 tier subconsciously. The Case of Charles Dexter Ward actually did very well despite such an inefficiency. It was not enough to prevent Asylum for getting funded.  

About potentially wrong assumptions. There has been noticeable decline in how easy it is to get funded if a project isn't fit. I still see healthy fit projects getting funded easily. It appears that campaigns in the $30,000 to $70,000 goal range may be the kind that can sustainably thrive and not the million dollar projects. You aren't far off at all there. Where I see your perspective deviates from mine is that you view Kickstarter as more combined and interconnected than I do. I view it more of as a colony of bacteria where survival is on an individual level, but there is also an overall health to the colony. Kickstarter is also not the marketing tool that some project creators hope it would be, or at least not any-more. The overall category pledges collected will change based on what types of projects run that month and consumer preferences that month. I also have this perspective from reading about the history of cinema and how box office numbers work. The overall health is about the quality of the projects bringing people back again and again or driving them away. I do disagree on the topics of what a good average pledge amount per backer is and when I see good up-selling flow there is still a gentle decline (Not an increase) as the tiers progress. A sudden jump indicates to me that the previous tiers were weaker picks for some reason. Based on the bell curves regularly seen in nature and in past campaigns I labelled as well executed, there should be such a gently decline in backer counts because of the real world spectrum of what backers are willing to spend on their indie games.

**MY family is from the Tyler TX area, AND my mother's family name is LANEY!!!**

Although I'm fairly sure that the Deanna Laney from this shocking news story is not a direct relationship to my branch of the Laney family, its still weird and surrealistic to see these highly coincidental facts reported in this alarming news report re: a fundy-cult church member led astray and gone wild by her VERY delusional religious beliefs in despicable fundamentalist church dogma.

Now its *story-time*, boys and girls:

Sit back and let me tell you a few things about wing-nut fundy-cult central - East Texas, where both sides of my family hail from. It is a very economically depressed region with a large majority of poor &amp; destitute population, and with little or no hope of ever seeing any change or relief.  And it is a perfect home to a religious quagmire of over-the-top christian fundamentalists that prey upon extremely poor, sick, undereducated, and disadvantaged folks with strong church-going family traditions. 

Talk about mental illness, between the fire-breathing tee-totaling dancing-is-a-sin southern baptists and the zombie-fied shaving-your-legs-is-a-sin pentecostals, the entire area is like an insane asylum of crazed zealots, driven out of their rational minds by the extreme cult influences found in thousands of small fundamentalist churches that dot the local communities like diseased smallpox sores. No matter how small a town may be, one can still find a church (or two) in it, stocked with ""holy"" men preaching sermons filled with intolerance &amp; hate for anyone that dares to be different, and with unquestioning fully-indoctrinated members constantly punctuating these hypocritical sermons with loud trance-inducing shouts of ""praise the Lord"". From Hellfire and Brimstone pulpit sermons, to churches filled with tranced-out church members speaking in tongues (you gotta see it for yourself to understand how shocking and outrageous that is), the small town fundamentalist church-cults continue to wield a tremendous amount of cultic influence &amp; control within the minds and lives of their depressed members and communities.

Once long ago while at a family get-together, when my Grandma Laney happened to overhear me chanting an early morning gongyo, she burst into my room, interrupting me and demanding to know what I was doing.  When she found out that I had become a Buddhist, she went into a delirious tantrum, complete with rolling tears &amp; teeth-gnashing. She was absolutely convinced that I had been possessed by the Devil himself, and that I was on a certain path to hell and damnation. In a surprising move, my Mom stood up for me and my SGI sourced (delusional) beliefs, escorting Granny from the room while telling her that I had a right to practice whatever religion I chose (which made me very proud of my Mom at the time!). I don't know what else my Mom told her, but thankfully Grandma never brought the subject up again, and neither did I.

My Grandma Laney was a loving, caring, very generous but extremely poor person, loved by everyone in her small local community. Over three-hundred people in a town with a population of just over a thousand turned out for her funeral. I loved and respected her too, but not her Christian faith. Because of her ties to the church, she was totally naive and uninformed about the real world outside of her fundy church shielded circles.  She was completely controlled &amp; indoctrinated by her church (and by evangelistic TV programing as well), and kept scared silly in a continuous state of fright, created by numerous implanted and unfounded fears of encroaching devils &amp; dangers lurking behind every tree and bush. 

Remember Jim And Tammy Baker, the famous crying TV evangelists that were caught red-handed ripping people off? My Mom once told me that when she took Grandma shopping, she had repeatedly heard Granny talk about needing to save some money back to send to her ""friends"".  Finally, my Mom got curious &amp; concerned, and asked Granny to explain who these ""friends"" were and why she needed to send them money every week. Turned out her ""friends"" were Jim &amp; Tammy, and that she was sending them money because they had told her to do so on their TV program, explaining how they needed every cent she could send in to them to ""do the Lord's work"". Did I mention how naive, and generous my Grandma was?  When she found out, my Mother was pissed. She had assumed that Grandma's ""friends"" were real-live folks from somewhere in the community, and couldn't comprehend why Granny, already so poor and destitute, would make more sacrifices by doing without the things she needed, in order to save up her money to send to these televised rip-off artists each week.  But Mom didn't understand the insidious nature of money-sucking cults, or their ability to use lies, deceit, and sophisticated brain-washing techniques to influence &amp; control their victims. And neither did I until just a few years ago.  

Uneducated, biased, close-minded, extremely racial prejudicial, and antiquated ideas are prevalent in many East Texan's minds. When Grandma Laney was in her eighties, she once asked my mom on the way to a doctor's appointment, ""I've been hearing on the TV news this word they keep using, ""ho-mo-secks-uler"" - what does that mean?""  When my mom told me about this my eyes just about popped out of my head. We both laughed aloud at the absurdity of trying to gently explain this hot-potato item to our Victorian Matriarch. Then I asked Mom, ""did you tell Granny what it means?"" She replied that no, she did not, and had quickly changed the subject instead. So I asked Mom if she thought Granny knew what a ""queer"" was, and why she didn't explain to Granny what the word ""homosexual"" meant.  She replied that she thought Granny did indeed know what a queer was, but didn't want to upset her (and Grandma would have been very upset) by explaining to her what the unfamiliar word from TV meant.  

This is a prime example of how backwards &amp; out of touch churchgoers from these small towns dominated and controlled by their cultist churches can become. Their worldviews are completely filtered and controlled by their church. And, having drank so deeply from the fundy kool-aid pitcher, they are quick to react &amp; become over-emotional when they encounter anything that goes against their cult indoctrinations - a reaction that is all too familiar to us ex-culties here on this sub. A reaction my Mom didn't want to provoke, and I understood immediately why she didn't want to go there. Sometimes ignorance really IS bliss.

My mother's funeral in Tyler, was presided over by a fundy-cult pastor/preacher.  His sermon was so offensive &amp; disgusting to me that I could not stomach it, and, in a fight or flight adrenal rush,  I absolutely HAD to get up in the middle of her funeral service and walk out of the church to avoid making an even more unpleasant scene right then and there.  That gut-wrenching walk down the aisle &amp; out the door served to further alienate me from the rest of my god-fearing fundy-cult family members. I have been disowned &amp; discarded by most of my family for over ten years now.

Here's yet another example of fundy-cult church indoctrinated fear and stupidity. At my East Texas martial arts dojo where I was an instructor, we had an entire family of students under heavy fundy-cult influence that refused to return to the studio for lessons unless we took down what they considered to be a ""religious shrine"" - a photographic collection of our school's historical lineage of master-teachers hung together on the wall.  After seeing me offer a quick standing bow of respect (there's lots of traditional standing bows in dojos - when you enter, when you face each other, when you open and close class, when your teachers address you, etc), but with the one single addition of my hands being pressed together as I offered a traditional gesture of respect to the pics of my martial art's revered teachers, they somehow perceived my display of a traditional form of respect as being a threat to their religious ""faith"".  Although they used my bowing to a shrine ""incident"" as a main excuse, I wouldn't doubt it if the biggest part of their fundy-cult induced reaction was due to the collection of foreign Asian faces plastered on the wall combined with the use of foreign Asian traditions. That's what probably really freaked them the most - a strong possibility considering the rampant racism prevalent around that area. Many fundy-cult East Texans have still not gotten over their implanted racial hatred of the Japanese left over from WWII indoctrination.  

Cult indoctrinated mentally deficient wing-nuts &amp; racial bigots can be found in great abundance all around Tyler. Even as I was becoming a teenager, it had already dawned on me that the level of social &amp; cultural development in this stronghold of repression was far under those in other regions. I realized that the entire area was several decades OR MORE behind in progress than the rest of the country &amp; world. And it is still far behind, mostly due to the stranglehold that fundy-cult churches still hold over their members minds, world-views, and church member's ability to think clearly &amp; form opinions for themselves. 

For example, just a few years ago in a tiny East Texas town, a black man was lynched to death by white men when they dragged him to a bloody pulp by pulling him on the ground while tied by rope to the back of a pickup truck. Yes, racism, lynching, and family violence are still alive and well in the land of fundamentalist Christian cults. Barbaric &amp; disgusting - you betcha! But that's what you get when agendas of hate, prejudices, and love-of-war are spoon fed to downtrodden folks by a fire and brimstone church/cult, and by pulpits filled with morally corrupt pastors &amp; pews with doe-eyed mind controlled members.

The lack of foreigners is something I dealt with fine, Skype, Facebook etc. makes the world a smaller place and it's always easy to have a chat with old friends if needed, and I had local friends and coworkers.

"ckijv0b","Juan 325 of the *Mingshi* describes him as Badugebahala (巴都葛叭哈剌) from the state of Sulu (蘇祿). It mentions that he died in Dezhou. The Annals for Emperor Yongle, in *juan* 7, describe the embassy of the three kings as well but not the death or the gifts afterwards. The annals uses the term ""coming to court"" (來朝), which is more important than ""coming for tribute"" (入貢), since many more states performed the latter than the former. The information provided in the *Mingshi* on Sulu is not extensive, showing it wasn't as important as Korea, Japan, or Vietnam, which all have information. This means that Emperor Yongle's actions weren't meant to boost Ming China's ties to what the empire saw as an insignificant state. What other information are you looking for specifically?

In regards to whether the Sulu king's honors were standard or not, the evidence says it was standard like the Ming's actions in similar circumstances. This would not be the only time that a foreign dignitary died on Chinese soil. From the same *juan*: In the third year of Emperor Yongle's reign, Manarejiana (麻那惹加那), king of the state of ""Boni"" (浡泥) died in Beijing. In the ninth year of Emperor Xuande's reign, there was something similar. Halizhihan (哈利之漢), brother of the king of Samudera (蘇門答剌), died in Beijing. These three people (the two kings and the brother of a king) all received generous but different forms of treatment after they died, so there's no specific protocol other than the emperor's whim. 

There is one more example I found, in *juan* 326, of a foreigner whose death in China merited a description in the *Mingshi*. A man named Li Mabao (利瑪竇), from the faraway state of ""Yidaliya"" (意大里亞), died in the 39th year of Wanli and was granted just a mere burial. However, the Ming court understood he wasn't a foreign dignitary, so his treatment can't exactly be compared to the other examples I mentioned. This man is known in English as Matteo Ricci.

"ckeoy3z","&gt;IF you try to explain this away with many-worlds theory, then his second statement about particles being non-deterministic would also be explained away, and his post is still wrong.

What HMARS was saying is perfectly compatible with the [quantum decoherence](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_decoherence) formulations, with many worlds being one articulated idea related to quantum decoherence. HMARS was discussing the freedom in selecting the fundamental entities being described by a theory, this kind of idea is *exactly* what lead to quantum decoherence and many worlds in the first place. Look at Everett's introduction to his PhD thesis:

&gt;[Since the universal validity of the state function description is asserted, one can regard the state functions themselves as the fundamental entities, and one can even consider the state function of the entire universe. In this sense this theory can be called the theory of the ""universal wave function,"" since all of physics is presumed to follow from this function alone.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_wavefunction)

Compare that to what HMARS said:

&gt;The behavior of quantum-scale systems is perfectly deterministic, it's just that it's wave functions that behave deterministically, and not individual particles. This isn't what we would, classically speaking, intuitively expect, but it doesn't mean the universe is ""all random,"" if that makes sense.

The concepts behind the statements are similar. You are thinking that my reading of him is overly generous, but actually many worlds and quantum decoherence have become fairly mainstream and it should be obvious that was what he was referring to in some sense, even if he was not explicitly aware of the details of different quantum mechanics formulations.

The idea that what he said about particles contradicts this reading is a stretch. The statement HMARS made about particles can be interpreted as meaning that the universal wavefunction behaves deterministically, and individual particles are not fundamental entities. Even if he explicitly said ""particles behave nondeterministically"" it would be perfectly reasonable to interpret this as meaning, ""observers experience apparent wavefunction collapse."" By your standard, referring to particles at all contradicts his belief in quantum mechanics, because particles are strictly classical entities. 

I don't ultimately think his statement is very meaningful, but there is an obvious interpretation in which it is not wrong. The interesting conversation to be had, in my opinion is why it is not wrong but not useful. Your argument has basically been that it is strictly wrong, and implicitly that the Copenhagen interpretation is a strict physical reality. Your argument is wrong.

"cjydu95","LOVE IS STRANGE, a film, unaffectedly directed by Ira Sachs, is so natural and unassuming in its portrayal of relationships that the divide between audience and the characters on the screen disappears; we are directly slipping into their lives with the ease of familiarity. There is a formal beauty to the movie, thanks to the cinematography of Christos Voudouris - the way he captures each space - delineated not only through décor, but through the light which mutates with the atmosphere, very much like a Chardin still-life painting, classic in its grandeur and silence.

The plot revolves around two gay men who have lived together for 39 years and finally get married, a decision that will alter their lives in ways that are unexpected and transforming. We first meet Ben, a seventy-one year old artist, (John Lithgow in a breathtaking performance) and his partner George (Alfred Molina in an equally fine portrayal,) a music teacher in a Catholic school - both excitedly, and nervously preparing for the ceremony and the post- wedding party. From the moment we first view Lithgow and Molina singing a duet together - their voices and theatrics in synch and at odds - tender intimacy is apparent. Ira Sachs and co-writer Mauricio Zacharias have created two remarkably gentle and loving individuals, their intimacy and enduring connection, is both understated and powerfully passionate.

The consequences of ultimately legitimizing their union bear witness to the harsh realities that accompany that choice. Soon after the nuptials, George gets fired from his job, and the economic demands of existing in NYC, forced to sell the apartment in order to find more affordable housing, interrupts their former cadence of living. Having no alternative, George and Ben, temporarily separate to move in with friends and relatives till they can find a home of their own. Molina and Lithgow stunningly convey the anguish of living apart and the intense longing of being united again. It is as if one person is sliced in half – going through the motions, but not fully functioning without the other.

LOVE IS STRANGE also references the mysterious corridor of generational diversity - both fractious and enriching. The anxious, rebellious teenager slowly embracing life's uncertainties embodied by Joey, Ben's great-nephew in an excellent performance by Charlie Tahan who is likable, secretive and obnoxious – an eternal artifact of an adolescent's growing awareness of life's promises and aching discomforts. And approaching mid-life, are his parents - Kate (Marisa Tomei - a natural wonder) - a writer trying to meet the demands of motherhood and still do her own work and Elliot (Darren E. Burrows) a father too wrapped up in doing business (supporting the family?) to notice the splintering family dynamic. Tomei's facial expressions convey a woman's inner tug-of-war between being a caregiver and accomplishing her own ambitions, shifting from haggardly frustrated to a luminous empathy, particularly for the growing pains of her son on the cusp of adulthood.

Director Ira Sachs has given us a tone poem to the beauty, delight and fragility of living in a city - New York - dynamic, diverse and constantly changing, echoing the vicissitudes of life as we stumble through our own personal unfolding. A love story that has depth and endurance - delicate and supple, both romantic and mundane, LOVE IS STRANGE is wrenchingly lovely and generous, but also a reminder that nothing is permanent.",1408809248,"a love story that has depth and endurance - delicate and supple, both romantic and mundane, love is strange is wrenchingly lovely and generous, but also a reminder that nothing is permanent.","lovely and generous","generous",NA,FALSE,"lovely and generous","lovely",NA,NA,0

People can exploit that trait. Don't be overly generous with your friends - it's ok to be a bit generous, but big money hand outs can lead people to hang out with you just to get a but of money.

I'm going to say straight out that you made a rookie error getting involved with a girl who feely admitted to you at the start that she had a crush on someone else. That was stupid behaviour. I also don't understand why you feel like it is your duty to tell your bro that the girl you are interested in is interested in him if you also have intentions of getting with her. 

Having threesomes/open relationships is supposed to add physical variety to a relationship - but if you know that your girlfriend had a crush on someone else then facilitating sex between her and that person is effectively giving her away to him. You might have some agreement in place that stipulates that that shouldn't occur - but in practical terms it's going to happen.

I believe that you probably can't trust your gf or your bro not to have sex with each other any more since you have - with your actions - brought them together. Keeping them apart is actually a bit mean. Unless you're going to marry this girl  you should assume that the relationship had a use by date and since your bro already has an opportunity to be happy witt this girl for a while you should give him a turn since you're already had a turn.

You're not separating your financial life from your friendships enough. Why are you giving your bro do much money just to play music? Why give him such heavy discounts just because he's you like him? If he isn't concerned about ripping you off, then perhaps he's putting his own interests ahead of yours too much to really be considered a friend.

Right. I want to address this because this has been getting out of hand for a while on this. It isn't that people don't take you seriously. It's the fact many of the Americans looking to get are doing so for petulant reasons. It's a failure of many to look around and realise they live in a first world nation that affords them many luxuries and freedoms.

Yes, there are problems. Yes, the NSA is bad. Yes, whichever wing you are not is radical and bizarre. But the truth is, whether people choose to accept this, is that most if not all European nations also have these same problems. The UK has UKIP. Hungary has Fidesz. The Netherlands has a Neo-Nazi party with a seat in the EU Parliament. There is no mythical ""best"" place, no utopia. 

I know the Nordics are frequently touted as this, but as someone with many Swedish and Norwegian friends it isn't as idyllic as it is made out to be. There are plenty of societal problems in both locations, particularly in Sweden where the open-door policy to refugees is increasingly leading to hostility. Most would not openly admit it within those countries, but many citizens are becoming more and more disillusioned with immigration to their nations. 

True, their social programmes are more involved and generous, but that doesn't mean they don't have strain and problems. On the NHS here in the UK it can take up to six months to see mental health specialists and my GP office in central London is under so much strain you can barely get an appointment for more than 10 minutes.

And, not to mention, almost all of these countries engage in some form of monitoring/spying on their citizens. The UK is almost as bad, if not the same, as the US, in my opinion. Beyond that, many European countries are also in worse economic straits than America - particularly in terms of high unemployment and high cost of living in certain areas. Where some are not, local language is incredibly important and people wonder, both on this sub and in these nations, why Americans who do not speak their language are on the ground there.

Europeans tend to have a more nuanced view of both their own countries and those of the world. It is baffling to a lot of people why Americans despise their country so much, but refuse to actually do anything about it. The abandon the sinking ship mentality is strange to many Europeans - particularly because many of their countrymen abandoned their countries when it was a sinking ship to the US. I do think Europeans tend to be more involved with politics, maybe as a result of this - but it seems to be people want to change their world rather than complain about it and run away from it.

This is why some requests are met with eye rolling. America is not some evil empire stealing civil liberties and squirreling away all the wealth. It is an extremely large country with many good and bad aspects and some pockets (states) are better than others. 

It tends to be the Europeans want to get out to experience the cultural powerhouse that is the US (Hollywood! New York! Like it or lump it, American culture, yes we have one!, is a huge export) or to grow their international experience. It tends to be many Americans on this sub want to get out because AMERICA IS AWFUL AND TERRIBLE AND BAD AND OH MY GOD IT IS SO EVIL PLEASE SAVE ME I NEED REFUGE!!!!! BUT I ALSO WANT ACCESS TO ALL THE THINGS I AM USED TO FROM AMERICA LIKE CAN I PLEASE HAVE CHEETOS????? (ETA: Hyperbole)

It is, frankly, ridiculous. That attitude of disliking your country should be reserved to the people who are being oppressed and suffering actual human rights violations - homosexuals in Uganda, the entire population of North Korea. Americans tend to be so incredibly insular that they don't even realise how fortunate they are to be in their country.

I hope this answers why people do not take these requests seriously.

As for computer science, it won't be instantaneous most likely. You will need to build a portfolio and career. Your best bet is Germany or the Netherlands. The shortage in computer science is increasingly becoming based around experienced programmers, typically with minimum 2 year experience and steadily moving toward five years or more.

Sacrifice does not have to be made to be charitable, but generosity has a connotative meaning that does seem to be directly tied to sacrifice. I think word choice is definitely the crux of OP's point.

I may be able to affect a homeless person's life by giving him a $50 bill on the street corner, but am I therefore generous? Nice, perhaps. Helpful, certainly. Charitable, by definition.

If I take the stipend I earn 

    $(S + 2000)

And then have to pay rent out of that total, so my take home after rent would be 

    $(S+2000-R)

If I take corporate housing, I earn

Plus I pay $500 for the place, so my take home would be

Now, we set

And solve for R to find how much the ""real"" rent of the corporate housing is

    R=2500

AKA, the subsidy just doesn't get paid to me, but it still goes to pay for housing. So, if I were to rent anything for under $2500, I would be saving money and my take-home pay would be higher.

Yes, a service like this could be abused, but if the concern is that people use it repeatedly, a delay between name changes would work as well as a cost. Say one name change every 3 to 6 months. 

Either way you do it, there's a development cost or an implementation cost for a service that most of the user base will never use. From a bean counter perspective, what is the point in implementing the service if they can't recoup some of the cost? It isn't something that the majority of the user base for the game will care about.

I understand the point about $10 getting you a lot of gaming these days, and obviously if the value isn't there to you for the name change, I wouldn't recommend using it. Still, comparison between a service based game and standalone games only go so far. The games you get in a Humble Bumble already have had a fixed sunk cost.

Radfems seethe with hatred when TRP talks about solipsism and hypergamy, but women do behave this way.  They simply do not have much empathy for the men they marry.  They  mostly have expectations.  They know that divorce law is slanted in their direction and they don't fear the termination of the marriage.  They do however know you as a man fear it.  This grants them license to behave very selfishly in marriage at times.

What women do fear is you having the ability to better deal them.  When they know you can trade them in for a younger model they tend to be more empathetic and treat you better overall.

If you have mastery over your own life and know you can weather the storm of divorce, they are less likely to be flippant and selfish.  If they know you can rebound and enjoy the company of younger more beautiful women, they respect the marriage more.

Your personal happiness will matter more.  You'll definitely get sex more.

Its not hard to find writings of women where they talk about men leaving them for younger partners.  They have anxiety over that.

So if you are a pleasant husband - loving, kind, caring and generous, but at the same time have that marital brand of outcome independence described above - your chances of having a successful marriage greatly improve.

Wifey will be happy and you'll be better respected in the marriage.  Instead of wifey seeing it as a threat in dread game, she see your outcome independence as proof that she has something valuable - something she needs to safeguard from the intrusions of other women.

Well - she will if she's smart.  Some women are too dumb and selfish for this kind of awareness.  They think they can be brats in any situation and get away with it.  Those women get what they deserve in marriages to high status men.

Women often view men as commodities - to be ignored or safeguarded  or valued or devalued  as much as the situation calls for.

Remember, respect is something you give yourself.  What you choose to live with is ultimately your choice.  You lay the groundwork for your position continually over the entirety of your life.  If you don't bother to make sure that you are in good position, don't count on your wife to.  That's a good way to end up divorce raped.

When it goes bad, she'll start game planning on how she's going to convert her commodity into a cash flow post divorce.",1401665392,"so if you are a pleasant husband - loving, kind, caring and generous, but at the same time have that marital brand of outcome independence described above - your chances of having a successful marriage greatly improve.","caring and generous","generous",NA,FALSE,"caring and generous","caring",NA,NA,0

"chgmheq","&gt;This place has been losing subscribers since we were a default. 

And what were things like before that?  What's the real issue; does being ""a default"" necessitate a loss of membership?  How to other defaults deal with it?  If what you're saying is true, it seems that all defaults should eventually wither away and fail after becoming defaults.  Is this the case?

&gt;Only now since we are not a default can you actually see the trend because the number are not actually inflated.

If you were losing membership before and are losing membership now, when did you ever gain followers?  These statements you're making aren't adding up.  

&gt;I give the users full credit for that. Any attempts to moderate this place has been met with extreme pushback and honestly there's only so much mods can do to help a subreddit , especially one with a community as hostile and toxic as this one.

The moment you start calling your customers names is the moment things start going downhill faster.  Of course people will be angry if you censor them.  But if you ignore the commentary, delete the offending posts, and remove repeat offenders, there shouldn't be any vitriol to speak of.  Beyond the background level of new users, of course.  And those weirdos who just make new accounts...I had to deal with one of them on a facebook group.  After a few years of a new account ever day or so, he gave up.  Meh.  If you can see folks' IPs somehow, it would be easier.  

&gt;If you noticed, we've had this sticky up for about a week and a half asking for more mods so clearly we are getting more mods, 

I'd say that's a bit generous, but sure.  You'll get plenty of mods.  

&gt;but there is only so much we can do here while the community downvotes every opinion that isn't exactly like theirs and gets into flame wars with people all the time. 

So it's a democracy, you say?  If I post something unpopular on imgur, I expect to be downvoted.  Why do you think this convention is a bad one?  It selects items that more people will find more interesting and pushes them to the top.  Being open-minded is good, but this isn't BBC or an AP website.  This is a social site.  You have to let folks do what they want to, to a reasonable extent.  

&gt;That turns people away much more than the mods and the rules (both of which most people barely realize exist). Opinion downvoting is over reaching censorship and the mods have nothing to do with that.

Sounds reasonable to me.  Every site seems to be like this nowadays, with various ""news"" webpages and blogs in which all/most of the commenters are one side versus another.  That's the way social sites work; they attract a particular crowd.  That's why it's a social network, and not a...formal debate forum.  In all honesty, the latter sounds like a much better place to have a political discussion, but I've yet to find such a place anywhere on the internet.  Shame.

"chadsgr","that sounds like a pretty big undertaking for a reddit comment.. show how 'society' is 'better' (neither defined) by the adoption of a whole range of policies, some of which i agree with and some of which i don't? get the chip off your shoulder!

as for 'best country in the world', we have never had that. we may have for a brief time had the best economic growth, but i can't think of any other measures we've ever been 'best'. we've never been best on human rights (and never worst). we've never been best on education. never best on medicine. there's literally no positive field that we can say for any measure of time america was the 'best' at. so if you're starting from the assumption that we have a Great Country then no wonder you keep going on about how people you disagree with are ruining it. 

and of course that all sidesteps the issue of how i'm not a liberal, i don't want to try to make capitalism a bit more bearable, i want to end it. 

ok, bullet points!

&gt;every attempt at communism in history

there have been no attempts at communism. you don't attempt communism. you might attempt socialism, which you hope can lead to communism, but that's it. as for 'failed states', what? there aren't that many of those and none of them i'm aware of were socialist. this is also a bit of a fallacy.. just because you haven't succeeded before, doesn't mean you can't consider trying again. although it would be pretty dumb to try if you haven't learned any lessons from previous attempts. 

&gt;running out of other people's money

you might be surprised to know that all of ""your"" money is owned by the state. the state prints it and issues it and then requests some back in taxes. why? because it's a pretty decent way of oiling an economy. but then whining that they ask for too much back merits a hearty chuckle. but hey, it's a cute phrase, i see the appeal. 

&gt;contrary to human nature

i forgot you were the sole arbiter of this, too!

&gt;there will always be [societal ills].

yep. are you under the assumption socialism is predicated on a perfect society made up of perfectly altruistic humans? nonsense. give your opponents at least *some* credit. i do like that you transitioned from ""defend welfare!"" to ""socialism will never work!"". you know those are two different audiences, right? socialists don't care about welfare (although we can be sometimes baited into addressing dumb arguments against it, i admit)

&gt;what [humans] do best-compete

i'm lucky to be in the presence of the expert on human nature. of course, decades of studies show humans are gregarious, social, altruistic and generous, but i'm sure competition is totally what we're best at. that's why all those hunter gatherer societies we had for the first half of our history were competitive! except, wait, no.

&gt;the cream will rise to the top

&gt;allowing them to keep the fruits of their labor

no, they don't. you pay taxes and you let the investors and owners of your business take a big slice of what you produce. this is a factually inaccurate description of capitalism

&gt;people don't do their best work if..

i love this. you can handwave anyone living under a 50% or higher tax as being unfairly held back from doing their very best. how could you possibly hope to prove it? i know i catch shit for saying things might be better in a different setup but dang. i know i sure get up every day and only do a half-assed job since the gubmint is going to take a lot of it.

There will be other chances &amp; opportunities for her to meet &amp; fuck other people so it's best to stick with quality people and situations where everyone is open, honest and above board. 

1 If you're just starting out and this is your kink then you should make sure every experience is a positive one otherwise she's not going to be comfortable or excited to do this. Based on what you know of this guy it doesn't seem like she'll come home feeling great about it since he seems kinda douchey (for lack of a better word).

3 Any lying is grimy and unnecessary. Part of what we enjoy about doing this is that we can be totally upfront and we expect people to do the same. There's no need for games, lies, deadlines, ultimatums, etc. 
If she already expressed interest in fucking him then there's no need fr him to flash pics of models to impress anybody so I don't get what his point was there...like 'hurry up and fuck me before I wife up this chick in Hawaii'...?

4 Paying for the room isn't a huge deal to me...but coupled with everything else it does make him seem like a less than ideal match. Personally anytime I've met at a hotel the guy I'm meeting has paid and arranged everything. It's very thoughtful and generous but not necessary. We're willing to split the room or pay for it if we really want to meet. I guess it depends on how she feels about that but to me it's just money and not a deciding factor of someone's character if they can't swing a hotel for the night.

I would pass on this guy and start looking for someone that will make it a great experience for both of you, especially since plenty of guys actively want to be the 3rd and actively participate in this kink. They'll respect your relationship, be honest and have an amazing time with her and it doesn't seem like this guy can deliver those things. Also you mentioned that they were already friendly, if it goes poorly then she might feel worse then if she were to have a less than stellar time with a stranger that she'll never have to see again.

"ch4ztmx","Barristan doesn't think Daenerys is crazy (not yet, at least). But he was in the Kingsguard from the time of Jaeherys II to the beginning of Joffrey's reign.  He would have seen the rise and fall of Aerys in its whole tragic story.  Aerys, in his youth, was well-meaning, charming, and generous, but quick to anger.  But when the Defiance of Duskendale happened, something snapped in Aerys.  This was a real threat to his reign - open rebellion by a not-inconsequential House, who had previously had very close ties to the Targaryens.  Aerys was likely already somewhat paranoid, but being held as a prisoner and having his life openly threatened by his captor - a terrifying experience for anyone - accelerate his madness.  If one House can stand up to him, seize him, openly defy him, any House can (and imagine how much more terrifying the ""southron ambitions"" alliance looked at that angle; the Darklyns were nowhere near as powerful as the Starks, Baratheons, Arryns, Tullys, and Lannisters individually, and exponentially less so together). It wasn't an overnight process with Aerys, I'm sure - Aerys reigned for almost 20 years.  From the Defiance to his assassination, Barristan would have seen the king move more and more to violent reactions to supposed defiance.

Now here's Barristan serving another young monarch.  She's well-meaning, charming, and generous.  But she has a dark streak, and has resorted to destructive, even bloody solutions to problems (burning the Good Master alive in Astapor, crucifying the 163 Meereenese nobles).  What's worse, she seems to base her vengeance on personal slights; she finds personally offensive the slave children's crucifixion, and she allows torture of innocents when she hears her favorite singer is killed.  So although he doesn't much talk about it, Barristan likely has some fears that, as someone on this sub brilliantly put it, ""he came looking for Rhaegar's sister but found Aerys' daughter.""",1398776886,"aerys, in his youth, was well-meaning, charming, and generous, but quick to anger.","charming, and generous","generous",NA,TRUE,"generous , but quick","quick",NA,NA,1
"ch48hij","&gt;But only a lack of sexual power can make someone feel like an inadequate human being. Social status is mainly relevant in terms of getting sex (money can get sex but not the kind that happens for mutual enjoyment).

How do you explain the LGBT and Equal Rights movements? They're not claiming that they're having trouble getting sex. They're claiming that they are oppressed in a way that make it difficult to gain power, safety, and security. If all LGBT people had the same reduced social status, then it wouldn't make a difference in their ability to attract partners and thus they wouldn't need to seek higher social statuses if the only goal was getting sex. There is far more at play in the world than sex and reproduction.

You're making a lot of unfounded generalizations here. Women are very much attracted to men men that are care and generous, but being selfless and lacking confidence sounds more like someone who doesn't know themselves well. Everyone wants to find someone with a strong sense of self and the ability to take care of themselves, otherwise they're just entering a relationship with someone who needs to be taken care of. Confidence is good, cockiness and egotism are not, and separating between the two can be difficult at first glance.

"cgu04pt","One of the main points of friction between Spain and Catalonia (And on all autonomous regions in fact) is that the Central government have transfered services (Social Security, Education, Justice, Police) but not income.

So, at the end, all those services are in close control by the central government, as they have the money. 

This has been the source of harsh discussions. The richest regions are always struggling with the buget, even if they are net payers to the central government.

This also helped Spain look better than it really is in this global crisis. When Europe forced to debt reduction, the Spain government pushed all  the cuts to the Autonomous regions, hence, forcing the ones to pay the services to reduce dubgets.

This even raised another nice and  dirty trick. Now all debt is on the Autonomous regions, so they cannot ask for money to the banks at a reasonable rate.

The Spanish government gratiously offered to be their bank, (at a generous but supportable rate), making them even more dependent and ready to be recentralized because of bankrupt.

That also offers a great anti independence propaganda. ""Those people want to be independent? if WE are helping them to pay their debts!"".

&gt;I was 17 when our marriage was arranged and he brought me here. I didn't speak very much english. He took my passport and papers. He treated me like a servant. Never let me go out or work or talk to anybody. He didn't even allowed a phone in the house, only his cell phone.
&gt;
&gt;Only when our daughters were born I got to work because he was too cheap to pay for shoes and clothes with ""his"" money for ""just girls"", even though he is very rich and I was working minimum wage.

"cg2yqa4","I disagree with Leff's argument because I think a God is not the only logical reason for humans to prefer one moral vs another. A lack of an ultimate authority does not mean anarchy rules.

I think that evolution can be a very logical explanation, where our current morals (that are mostly universal across all human societies), have naturally arisen because they are a form of stability. 

I got this idea from Richard Dawkins' book Selfish Gene. Here's the explanation:

Imagine there are two types of humans: Selfish and Generous. The Selfish always keep their resources to themselves, while the Generous always serve others first. However, it's not always good to be Selfish since if two Selfish people happen upon a loaf of bread, they will fight and both could potentially be lethally harmed. Meanwhile, the Generous happily share their bread. If we run a simulation with limited food as to which group would prevail, there is an equilibrium, hypothetically 30% Selfish and 70% Generous.

But humans aren't one or the other. Instead, we are mostly a third type: where we adapt to the people we meet. We have evolved to change our behavior in reaction to others. In our hypothetical world, there would be a mutation that causes a third time, Adaptables.

Adaptables avoid fights with the Selfish but take food from the Generous. And when they meet another Adaptable, they share. They would become the dominant force because of equilibrium, because their strategy is the most stable/optimal strategy.

This is a good explanation as to why killing, lying, stealing, are all immoral BUT people generally do agree there are exceptions. For example, killing is bad UNLESS in self-defense. It's because these kinds of behaviors have been driven into us through years of evolution, where people unable to lie, or compulsive liars, or serial killers/pacifists are just a minority. Because the optimal strategy is to adapt.

Finally, I think that modern wars and regimes such as Pol Pot only seem more bloody in comparison to the crusades because 1) there are more humans to kill, 2) our weapons are much more deadly, 3) we can travel so much faster and therefore violence spreads much more rapidly. I'm sure that if the Crusaders had guns, tanks, and fuel, many more people would have died.",1394851052,"here's the explanation:  imagine there are two types of humans: selfish and generous.","selfish and generous","generous",NA,FALSE,"selfish and generous","selfish",NA,NA,0

&gt; attractive good-looking guys who are nice to you?

Are those attractive good looking guys already attractive? Great! But in this example, I can predict that RPers would think the being nice part is over-rated, and yes, tell you you're *wrong* in thinking that your *base animal sexual attraction* stems from that. RPers are usually very adamant about not being apologetic about ideas, but the premise is, sexual strategy is amoral, so we only consider what works and then everything else is an afterthought. Including, unfortunately, opinions. The subject is biased about his tastes :( Its I guess, a type of profiling the sexual behaviors of humans, not considering either male or female as individuals,(with of course very varied tastes and thoughts and dreams and wishes!) but as animals. In the same way we'd profile monkeys or lions. Men are simple creatures, who can effortlessly produce enough sperm for 1000 women in a short period of time, with minimum effort. The only metric they search for to determine attraction is good genes. Looks are a great indicator of genes. So sexual attraction for men is almost entirely physical. RPers will also insist that for men other qualities about a woman, her career, her education, her social status, etc, will not enhance her purely *sexual* desirability. In fact, it sort of intimidates some men because then their markers for desirability are less prominent(dominance, we'll get to that). Most men do reluctantly agree. Even though it is kind of insulting to be labelled as so simplistic! RP isn't kind to men or women.

But here's where it gets interesting. A woman endeavouring to make a child is undertaking an arduous, painful and risky undertaking. And she'll be vulnerable while pregnant, and need to be fended for. And protection and resources for her small children. Simply selecting for genes is a great way for her descendants to die out. :( So she needs to select for things that enhance her offspring's chances! What should be on the list? Great genes, protection, provision, and a father who's likely to stick around. Unlike men, not all of these things are discernible at first glance, and really hard to guarantee so women need to be much more discerning with who they reproduce with. They're the choosers in most courting, depending on what they want. And choosing is a difficult job, and especially to accurately establish instinctual attraction for. Your instincts can't check bank accounts or do background checks. What usually results is some behavioural markers which are likely to point to the qualities they're looking for and different types of attraction develop for each(yes, there are different types). So, you see, men are really simple. Easy to figure out. Women aren't. 

Going back to our original discussion, if being nice is an attractive trait, a control group of very decent and generous, but otherwise deficient men, would be very desired! But not to dip into the fedora tipping circlejerk of reddit, its not so. These men are great at emotional bonding though, but lose out in sexual attractiveness contests to others every time. In other words, they make great long term partners. In RP terminology, the type of man a woman feels comfortable being with, and who she wants to provide for her. This says nothing about how manly he is, or how sexually desirable, just that he's good provider/nurturing father/husband material.

The question is, what creates pure sexual attraction/desire? Well, RPers think the answer is perceptions of value. Value being the things fulfill our innate shopping list of a mate. The types of value that appeal to the parts of you that sexually desires someone. How do you create those? Well, being nice isn't always the best method unfortunately! :( So now what? Well, you're left with trial and error. You ask people who've slept around a lot to quantify the things women do respond to. ""Good-looking""? Okay. Great! ""Attractive""... Hmm, kinda ambiguous. Lets break it down some more. You're not wrong, per se. In fact, you're absolutely right! Just not very precise. I can taste a dish and guess what I like, but not guess the recipe... Usually, a woman isn't the one selling herself. She just has to buy whatever the male is selling. We believe a good enough salesman can sell AIDs to Africa, and so we work on 

Here's where red pill starts to list things that gets people laid reliably, and fits into our model of demonstrating value to her, basically everything else beyond appealing to the person in her(because that's not a reliable way to get laid), but appealing to the animal.
Being assertive, dominant, aloof, confident, dread game, dark triad, **game** in general, etc,etc adjectives(throw in some RP stuff here)


Of course we can debate about how right or wrong it is, but in the end, it doesn't matter. Sexual strategy *is* amoral. Red pill ideas consistently do get men laid. Maybe the model is stupid. But the fact there is some intuitive reasoning in their heads, beyond ""being yourself"" and vague obvious things like ""be attractive, good-looking guys who are nice to you"" and thus helps their game and absolute confidant conviction when picking up women. Placebo effect? Who knows?

But I just hope it helps you, if not excuse, but get into our heads of why it is we tend to completely dismiss your opinions on it altogether. Hell, I'd get downvoted if I tried to tell anyone what men are just because I'm a man, instead of going out there, being a woman and picking me up. And then endlessly discuss between hundreds of successful PUA women what works when gaming men(fortunately, women's game is either non-existent or not complicated, men just want sex all the time. they're pretty much the judges, the customers, while we're the players and salesmen. sad but true).

2. 8 of cups-- Leavetakings. You will most likely leave your current job. You hate to see a project undone, but it might be better off. It might be worth looking into a transferal rather than just quitting because you've done good work there.

3. 10 of swords-- DON'T burn bridges when you leave. Don't anger anyone or say anything that might jeopardize you in the future. You need to be smart about this. Also, it will be time for you to leave because you've accomplished all you've been able to accomplish there.

My mom has spent a *lot* of time doing research on Asperger's to try to figure out how to deal with it and relate to him so I'd also suggest that. Some of the stuff you read can be scary but it's really difficult to understand them otherwise.

People with Asperger's aren't bad people even if they seem like it up front. My brother's jerk behavior can probably be explained away as him being spoiled.

My brother never benefited from therapy. He took some anti-anxiety medication at some point which really helped him but for some reason he buys into the whole not wanting to rely on medication bullshit. If it helps, it helps.

"cdi5hhh","A large reason lobbying is such a problem in the US is due to the gradual centralization of power at the federal level. This leads to rent-seeking (such as lobbying), as it's far easier and more effective to lobby a few reps and senators at the federal level than it would be to lobby dozens (if not hundreds) at the state level if power was more decentralized. 

Education in the US has always been an issue of money not going where it needs to go (among other things), not that there's not enough going around. Per student spending in the US is one of the highest (like, in the top 3) in the world. I'm on my phone but I'll try and dig up the info later.

As for scaling up the welfare state, that's a complex issue affected by a variety of things, from culture to other government policies. Scandinavian cultures tend toward communalism (look into the Law of Jante), whereas American culture is highly individualistic. Scandinavian countries are also very homogeneous, and, like it or not, humans are a lot more willing to help people who look like them. Tribalism's a bitch to overcome. Americans also tend to support private charity, mutual aid organizations, etc., and can be skeptical of a more extensive welfare state as part of their general skepticism of the state in general.

With regard to other government policies, a common critique of a generous welfare state is that it's incompatible with an open immigration policy. The Scandinavian countries tightly control immigration and citizenship - I believe Sweden has the most generous immigration policy (as a way to encourage diversity iirc), but it still is very closed off compared to US policy (which is in dire need of reform, but I digress).

Overall, I certainly agree that the welfare state in the US needs reform (to be both more efficient and generous), but one can't simply look at Scandinavia and then scale it up.",1384888522,"overall, i certainly agree that the welfare state in the us needs reform (to be both more efficient and generous), but one can't simply look at scandinavia and then scale it up.","efficient and generous","generous",NA,FALSE,"more efficient and generous","efficient",NA,"more",0

"cda3svk","&gt; Also where does the Justice League manage to raise the funds for such a generous but costly endeavor?

well firstly the justice league gets massive government subsidies for staffing and communications connectivity.  This is partially to ensure national governments can respond appropriately to larger threats, partially to ensure staff is composed of authorized legal agents so villains can be appropriately processed by the relevant legal bodies(though some are annoyed that justice league treaties forbid the use of capital punishment on threats apprehended by league activity), and largely in an attempt to gather intelligence on league members, activities, and tech.

On top of subsidies the league has numerous super geniuses and otherwise wealthy individuals with the ability to generate and donate substantial quantities of capital as needed.  Superman as well is well known to assist in the space programs and civil engineering projects, though he does charge a price ""intended to prevent over-dependence and stimulate scientific innovation.""",1383963260,"&gt; also where does the justice league manage to raise the funds for such a generous but costly endeavor?","generous but costly","generous","but",FALSE,"generous but costly","costly",NA,NA,1

I never considered that I wouldn't find those likable quirks. Senegalese are extremely generous, but more because it's so expected of them and they count on someone else being generous back. Some HCNs constantly take advantage of the expectation for generosity by asking for money, clothes, cars, visas, etc, because they assume foreigners have a lot to give.

"cd1iv62","That's a great theory when you're the person getting asked out, but when you have to ask people out you have to realize that numbers do pay a large part.  

Long term friendships are the same way.  Think of how many friends of a friend you meet, how many people you've gone to business lunches on, how many offsite meetings or conferences you go to in a year.  Think of all those people.

How many of them are now long-term friends?  

At the end of the day, there are only so many people that your personality will click with.  Of that small (compared to the population) number, only a very small number of those people will have personalities that you really mesh with.  

Dating is the same way, only you're are a lot more particular about the initial meet which increases the odds of meeting someone that you mesh with.  Between steady SO's I think I averaged 15 first dates?  Something like that, and I'm pretty picky.  It just turns out that while we might have the potential to be friends, there wasn't the romantic spark that I wanted so I moved on.  I'm now dating someone that I sparked with right away and we've been together for a year now.  

Now lets say that I had a success rate of 10% of asking to getting a first date (and that's pretty generous, but easy numbers).  I had to ask 150 first dates, and I got 15.  135 rejections initially, 15 after the fact, one success.  That's numbers.

Now add in the cost of first dates.  Lets say the average first date costs $30 (and that would be considered inexpensive).  Meet at a pub?  2 drinks and a snack + tip is easily $30.

"ccwf49r","So, I'm currently running the 'Way of the Wicked' adventure path, and there's quite a lot that's comparable to this. Minor WotW book 1 spoilers ahead, doing my best to avoid specifics.

During book 1, the players are tasked with weakening the ability of a keep to defend itself. A list of possible approaches are listed to the DM, mostly how players might sneak in, how they might cause tension between people in the keep, and a few other things. While the DM can hint at these things and they're certainly going to be useful to the PCs, it would take a group of PCs with a very relevant skill-set to actually complete this objective with just the book's offerings. It's largely a case of, ""here's a keep, here's it's inhabitants and some details on them, here's some plot sparks, facts, rules, but you are going to need to provide the solution"" -- much like your problem. 

I've had to make up quite a bit of extra content, and expect to do the same, depending on how long the situation takes (we're ~40-50 hours into the keep situation, IRL time, and probably just over half way through). If players ask about local people with relevant skills, be generous but reasonable, (they might be able to find some hunters, or an expert on dinosaurs, but you probably shouldn't let them find an expert T-Rex trapper), if they're looking for local areas that might help, the same (they might find somewhere that makes some traps for local animals, but they aren't going to be tailored to catching a T-Rex, and they might need some help to make one, or the group will have to use one for a different animal in a creative way, or something. They might be able to find a valley they could lure it into for an ambush, also, let them be creative). If they get stuck and the session risks stagnating, perhaps bring in one of the above resources - stumbling across the valley, seeing the hunter hunting something, which lets them continue to pursue their objective instead of give up and look elsewhere for quests.

"cctt24j","I think what I would have to emphasize is that ""Nice Guy"" is a *very* value laden word; there's a reason that some women are coming forward here and saying its something that has been associated with attempted (or succeeded) forced rape. If you want to just talk about someone who is a *nice fellow* that is a different argument, but I would stand by saying that ""nice"" isn't really a descriptor trait, its simply meeting the basic minimum to be a decent human being. People tend to say ""...but I am such a nice guy!"" when they are talking about how they *didn't* harass someone, or they weren't *overtly* a jerk - its used as justification instead of actually arising from character. 

That's what becomes problematic with the ""Nice Guy"" trope - the assumption that tends to be loaded into it that through the act of doing ""nice"" actions, they become entitled to something. They have been ""nice"" to a woman, maybe they've bought her stuff or spent time money and energy on her... And suddenly when they ""make a move"" their feelings are not reciprocated and they feel like they've been paying into something that didn't come to fruition. It gets them angry, or bitter, or whatever sort - its the method of how they go about trying to ""win"" things, and their reaction to it that identifies them as a ""Nice Guy"". 

When we talk of the stereotype of the ""Nice Guy"" we are not stereotyping people who are *nice fellows*, but talking about people who fit into this frame work. Similarly, people who knowingly take advantage of a generous but socially inexperienced person are not ""good people"" either, but that doesn't mean that it reflects on all of women - nor does the ""Nice Guy"" reflect on all of men.

well at the time there wasnt a struggle. maybe then was the beginnings of mine but if it was then i was super in denial about it. i mean i read that and i see myself trying to make it like shooting up heroin every day is normal and totally okay and that there wouldn't be any negative consequences if they arent ""stupid"". i read that and i think what a child i was only 3 years ago. i feel irresponsible for posting that because i could have made someone think that doing heroin wasnt a big deal and that it probably wouldn't affect them negatively. how naive i was!! since then i gave SO much to my addiction. i gave it most of my stuff, a relationship with someone who really loved me, someone that i still love deeply, the trust of my family and friends, jail time/being a felon now as a direct result of my addiction, i've been homeless, i've done things that i said i would never do to get more, and it stopped being fun a long time ago. i got clean this year for about six months but i relapsed back in july and im trying so hard to find subs or bars to wean off. i really want to quit. it stopped being fun a long time ago and i am so ready to do something with my life, and i cant do that on dope. i even lied in that IAMA a little bit, not flat out fabrications but i know i was trying to make it sound more like everything was fine and dandy when really i was a dysfunctional

like to lie to them and they still think im clean, and i have a lot of intelligence and talent that just isnt being used. i really dont want to be another depressing cautionary tale, i want to start doing something with my life. dont get me wrong, i dont regret becoming an addict. getting dragged down so far and so rough really humbled me. i am a much more compassionate, empathetic, nonjudgmental and understanding person than i was back then. i have always been pretty kind, sensitive and generous but only to people that i thought were worthy or whatever, and now i am not so quick to write someone off. i try very hard not to judge people, to put myself in their shoes, give them the benefit of the doubt, and help them where i can. weird as it sounds, becoming addicted to heroin made me a

"ccp2msv","Personally, I don't think it's an interface problem, so much as it's a problem of my options after I've been discovered in stealth games. A lot of the time, if you fuck up stealth you're either dead, or you're fucked so hard on your resources (health, ammo, etc.) that reloading is really the only viable option unless you're playing on some kind of super forgiving difficulty where you get more resources later. I find that I'm frequently and paradoxically punished for choosing non-or less lethal all stealth builds or routes in many games because once I'm discovered, my options are to either die, or get hunted down and waste precious resources in the process. I loved it to death, but Deus Ex: Human Revolution is a good example of this. All stealth delivers the most reward in terms of XP, but baby Jesus help you if you alert enemies to your presence because you're either going to be mowed the fuck down or spend the next 10 minutes in a delicate dance of rounding corners and trying to evade shit until the enemies go back to staring at walls and patrolling long corridors with gigantic pauses at each end where they mostly just stare at the ceiling, and apparently can't see you hiding behind a box from 10 feet away.

It's a weird dichotomy. That being said, I don't mind so much, as I tend to view quicksaving as a way to get to know the game intimately. If I fail at one approach, I'll reload and try a few more, then combine my experiments into the best overall approach. Then, the next time I play the game, I'll be more informed and I can make different decisions based on my new build, or revisit the game with the same type of build and play through with more confidence, knowing what the game has to offer. 

In a way, I also view this kind of repetition in the same way I view dying a lot in games like Ghosts and Goblins or Megaman. There's a memorisation curve figured into the game and getting it right takes practise. Stretches, sequences or set pieces can sort of be viewed as stages in the level. I try to only quicksave or reload before long sequences of enemies or objectives or whatever. 

Ultimately, I would like to see a game that has a generous, but fair amount of resources, with a realistic form of stealth, evasion and combat that lets you evade enemies dynamically, rather than ""stealth, discovery, hide, wait out search and resume game"", or ""engage enemy, die or use up most of your resources"". A dynamic AI that doesn't simply rely on predictable patrol paths and search tactics would be nice. An option to run and hide in unorthodox places, stay hidden for real or be forced to find additional hiding places, or use convincing distraction to obfuscate and confuse your enemy until the AI actually gives up on looking for you would be good too. Honestly, I think The Last of Us did a pretty good job of this with the human AI, but the infected simply re-introduced this same problem (basically if a runner or a clicker sees you, reload your fucking game...).

Conservatives see a world that is dangerous and hard and they react by being protective. Liberals see a world that is full of goodness and they view it as atrocious to not share that goodness. Both of those worlds exist and overlap with each other.

Maybe instead of ""spoiled"" you could just say ""fortunate and generous, but sadly blind to the dangers of the real world."" For conservatives you could say that they're ""responsible and diligent but unfortunately they can exclude people who really need to be included or need help.""

"cbyery5","That's a really good point, and it's the weakest aspect of my story. I don't have a *great* answer for you but I do have *an* answer that I hope you'll understand.

There are a lot of things that customers can communicate to you purely by the way they carry themselves, their demeanor when you're trying to help them, and the tone of voice they use with you, which aren't easy to convey in textual form for the purposes of a story on reddit.

In that particular store, we dealt all day long with people who felt that they were entitled to special treatment because they had money – not because they were *paying us* money, per se (though most of them did at some point) but just because they *had* it.

For example: ""Why should I have to make an appointment? I'm here now. Don't you know who I am?"" ""Sir, I don't know who you are, and even if I did, there are other people who made appointments and are here on time."" Or there's always my personal favorite: ""I need a brand-new phone to replace the one I broke, and I need it RIGHT NOW because I'm a doctor, and people could DIE if I can't receive my phone calls! And no, I won't be paying for it, because it's your fault for making it so easy to break!""

Over time, we learned to get a good sense of how entitled a person felt they were from their body language and other nonverbal cues. I don't know how to explain this to you if you've never actually encountered it.

I do realize this is stereotyping, and therefore not the most intellectually honest thing for us to do, but... you know how TFTS likes to stereotype users as clueless imbeciles? We know, intellectually, that there are *some* users out there who *don't* waste our time, but they're not the people that TFTS is about. It's the same kind of thing. Certainly there were a handful of customers at that store that were extremely well-off and were still polite, courteous and generous, but they were the exception rather than the rule.

The particular lady in this story stalked up to the bar in a very demanding way. When she said ""this is my son's laptop and he says it doesn't turn on,"" she said it in a dismissive sort of voice, like ""I have better things to be doing than being here, can't you make this trouble go away?"" It's really hard to convey in text all of the ways in which this woman communicated her disdain and her disconnect from the world.

"cbv6ahk","The thing is, when girls call a guy 'nice', we're searching for a word and that one seems the least derogatory. It's used with the same tone when someone's looking for redeeming qualities in a friend's painting and finding none. A generous but needy guy gets the 'nice' sticker. So does a passive guy who goes wherever you lead him. Or the guy who thinks standing his ground will make you dislike him.

The thing is, girls do the same thing. Unconfident, needy, passive, agreeable girls aren't rare, either. Do they hold your attention? Really? Other than for being 'hot'?

Virtue is attractive. Being generous *without* making a girl feels like she owes a guy is attractive. Don't just say nice things: go volunteer at a soup kitchen once a week. That's much hotter. Being proficient in what you're passionate about-- within reason-- is also hot. Granted, if all you're passionate about is video games, you're only going to impress diehard gamer girls. *Making* games on the other hand.... Well.

I do believe that demand drives economies but I'm not so dogmatic as to say that all spending is equal and drives demand equally

It's ALL consumer spending. It doesn't leave any type of consumer spending out, that's why it's total consumer spending.

&gt;I agree with this and believe it is happening today.

Okay so simply increasing demand simply increases profits to cronies while impoverishing everyone else through taxes and inflation.

&gt;At the very least, though, it calls into question your assertion that consumer spending is high and the economy sucks, therefore stimulating consumer spending doesn't drive demand.

Consumer spending is at an all-time high. It's a simple fact I've pointed out four times. There is no calling it into question, it is a simple statistical fact. 

The idea that consumer spending may be misallocated into inefficient or rent-seeking sectors is a completely different and worthwhile argument.

Some of your ideas are good. Some are bad. 

cap gains tax rate is complicated and debatable so Ill leave this one alone.

agree on flat corp rate

Glass-Steagall is stupid and would do more bad than good. The US was the only country to ever implement such an arbitrary and nonsensical rule, and for good reason.

The price of financial services was much higher before the big banks. 

consumer protections is a slipper slope to a complete nanny state. I generally don't trust the lobbyist corrupted gov't to have power over my purchasing decisions, but it may be good for the common drooling idiot.

good on no bailouts

"cb60u7x","&gt;I've never had a situation where a player with a cohort has had a leadership score lower than allowing them to have their cohort at their level -2. The score is entirely subjective, and points awarded are up to the DM

The large majority of score is completely stagnant and numerically based (Character Level + Charisma Modifier). Even then, the extra criteria is almost entirely cut and dry, and up to the player or the circumstances of the campaign (unless the DM is entirely controlling the character's backstory which I don't really condone). It's up to the DM to decide whether the leader's actions are considered is cruel or aloof or fair and generous, but the rest is pretty much up to the player to include and represent through roleplay and lore.

The campaign in question started brand new so I couldn't yet make judgement calls on the Leader's methods. The player chose to have no base of operations through his backstory, and has no animal companion/familiar/mount due to being straight fighter. He was level 9 with a -1 modifier to Charisma. I ruled he got the +1 for a ""special power"" due to his unique weapon, but he also travels frequently, giving the -1. That puts his leadership score at 8, giving him a level 5 companion.

The way I see it, the levels here are pretty important. The cohort will always eventually catch up to the Leader, but it will take longer to do so depending on how efficient the Leader is to begin with. It's about balance and character builds. Just like you can take weapon finesse even if you only have a +1 or even +0 to your Dex.

My games also frequently have players of different level, though they've never been more than one level apart thus-far. Everyone levels at the same rate due to monsters giving a flat amount of XP. I loved this change in Pathfinder from. 3.5 because it makes it much easier for a DM like me who meticulously calculates XP. However, I award lots of bonus XP for character backgrounds, character development, roleplaying, good ideas, and simply fun situations/scenarios that occur and stick in my mind after everyone goes home. Also, on the rare occasion that the group splits up and gets into combat, those combats are calculated separately for XP. I like to encourage/reward good participation.

Hell, you could be working at a soup kitchen instead of sitting here, but here you are... We could all do more :)

&gt;Maybe you already are changing the lives of 1,000 people. Why not change the lives of 1,001?

I don't particularly care about specific individuals. I try to focus my efforts on organizations that do some form of community building / improvement. Like I wrote elsewhere; I prefer the *""Teach a man to fish*"" mentality, instead of handing out fishies to everyone that's hungry.

&gt;Let's say my net wealth is $100,000, and I devote 10% of that to helping others. The other 90% I use on myself. That's pretty reasonable and generous, right? But to someone whose wealth is $1,000,000,000, I don't think 90% is reasonable to use for oneself. Your expenses shouldn't scale linearly - there's only so much you can reasonably spend on yourself. At some point, the cost of living changes from ""extremely comfortable"" to ""luxurious"". That's when money is just being wasted on things beyond their worth.

Right, but if you have $100k there isn't a whole lot to do with it. You can split it between charity and consumption, but that's pretty much it.

When you have $1billion, the function of it isn't the same. Now you need to look at creating sustainability. So you invest that $1billion, and you use the profits from it to achieve whatever goals you may have (don't care if your goals are charity or buying an NFL team, the principle is the same.)

Your focus isn't to give away $900million, it's to create a system that can keep going for year after year. 

&gt; Your expenses shouldn't scale linearly - there's only so much you can reasonably spend on yourself. At some point, the cost of living changes from ""extremely comfortable"" to ""luxurious"". That's when money is just being wasted on things beyond their worth.

Right, but if you look at Bill Gates who's now worth around $75billion, he isn't sitting there with $75billion in his bank account. It's all investments, trying to create more value, setting up new businesses, creating new charitable foundations. The best thing he can do with his money is to *create more money*. (Obviously that is contingent on his desire to use that money for good, unlike Steve Jobs who just wanted to hoard as much as possible.)

&gt;I think wealthy people have enormous responsibility in our society to do good. 

I don't. I think *it would be a good thing* to be generous, but I don't think being wealthy means that you have a larger responsibility for other people than what a middle class family would have, for example.

"cays1cw","I've spent at least five years each in Boulder (Colorado), Boston, Houston, and a small town in southern Louisiana called Morgan City.  This was my impression:

Northerners in general were better educated and more interesting to talk to, but they were much more likely to be dicks.  Southerners were very friendly and generous but seemed significantly less...I'll say ""educated"", but what I really mean is exposed to and accepting of people not like themselves.  They were less cosmopolitan, and as a consequence, less accepting of gays, minorities and non-Americans.

Personally, I don't see a cultural issue here (except for the mean Northerners vs nice Southerners), but an economic one.  Honestly, I came to the South with a lot of prejudices, and it took me a while to realize that uneducated is not the same thing as stupid.  I learned a lot of respect for people that I would have just written off as ""dumb hicks"" before I lived around them.  

At the same time though- and this is Morgan City I'm mostly talking about here- lack of exposure to people who weren't also poor, white, christian, straight and southern really did seem to allow bigotry, prejudice and xenophobia to exist to a much larger extent than I saw outside of the South.

So, my answer is that the actual people aren't bad at all,  but that lack of exposure to gays/minorities/non-Christians/non-Americans really did seem to allow for ignorance and prejudice to be more acceptable in the culture.

edit: So, sure, there are people like this up North too.  In a nutshell, the qualities I didn't like seemed to be related to poverty, and there was more poverty in the South.

There are plenty of people who try to change the status quo but the problem is a combination of culture and inertia. 

France has some very skilled, educated people, great infrastructure and some superb entrepreneurs.  However, it is extremely centralized with a highly inbred academic elite that pays lip service to a kind of social egalitarianism, and frankly, a lot of people who feel very entitled to benefits (working hours, holidays, job protection) that are not just generous but unsustainable. 

Furthermore there is a culture that discourages risk taking for the sake of change - there is the idea that ""if we do nothing, it is the boss' fault, if we do something and it fails it is my fault"".

People think you're snooty because Connecticut has a culture that is drastically different from the rest of the country.  CT is very fast paced.  People drive fast, food service is fast, checkout lines are fast.  Everywhere else I've lived has been considerably slower.  It's something you get used to real quick (I loved it), but it makes Nutmeggers seem impatient in other places.  Another big difference is that people interact is a much different way.  Politeness is not measured by the conversation you have with the guy at the gas station while getting some smokes, nor do you say please/thank you/etc. with the same frequency as other parts of the country.  There's also an emotional distance that's expected in Mass/RI/CT that runs contrary to many other parts of the country.  Mix all that together, and you seem snooty.

"car2ymc","&gt;Actually, it seems to me that consequentialism and stoicism are vehemently opposed. To the consequentialist, it is the effects of an act that determine if it is good or bad, and the intent is utterly irrelevant. To the stoic, the effects of ones actions are out of ones control and thus indifferent, whereas the intent is where moral decisions reside.

I don't see how we can assess actions without looking at their consequences. Of course, when presented with two choices with equivalent outcomes, the one with nobler intentions is preferable. However, when the outcomes are not necessarily equivalent, it seems to me fairly obvious that consequence takes priority over intentions. 

For example, take two celebrity philanthropists. Philanthropist A is a generous but modest person who donates to charity with little self-promotion as he is only concerned with helping people. Philanthropist B is generous but only so because he wants to improve his reputation. Rather than simply donating, B advertises his philanthropy and many people, as a result, are inspired to donate to charity. It seems to me that, as noble as A's intentions were, B has achieved the greater good.

**“Be the flame, not the moth.”**

“As for myself, I always willingly acknowledge my own self as the principal cause of every good and of every evil which may befall me; therefore, I have always found myself capable of being my own pupil, and ready to love my teacher.” 

**“I have loved women even to madness, but I have always loved liberty better.”**

“Love is only a feeling of curiousity more or less intense, grafted upon the inclination placed in us by nature that the species may be preserved.” 

**""Let anyone ask a beautiful woman without wit whether she would be willing to exchange a small portion of her beauty for a sufficient dose of wit. If she speaks the truth, she will say, 'No, I am satisfied to be as I am.'""**

""It is only necessary to have courage, for strength without self-confidence is useless.""

**""As to the deceit perpetrated upon women, let it pass, for, when love is in the way, men and women as a general rule dupe each other.""**

""Love is three quarters curiosity.""

**""a man who makes known his love by words is a fool""**

""After all, a beautiful woman without a mind of her own leaves her lover with no resource after he had physically enjoyed her charms.""

**""In a woman learning is out of place; it compromises the essential qualities of her sex ... no scientific discoveries have been made by women ... (which) requires a vigor which the female sex cannot have. But in simple reasoning and in delicacy of feeling we must yield to women.""**

Additionally, Casanova often portrays the irrational self confidence that Heartiste talks about.

&gt; Prince Charles de Ligne, who understood Casanova well, and who &gt;knew most of the prominent individuals of the age, thought Casanova &gt;the most interesting man he had ever met: ""there is nothing in the &gt;world of which he is not capable."" Rounding out the portrait, the Prince &gt;also stated:
&gt;The only things about which he knows nothing are those which he &gt;believes himself to be expert: the rules of the dance, the French &gt;language, good taste, the way of the world, savoir vivre. It is only his &gt;comedies which are not funny, only his philosophical works which lack &gt;philosophy—all the rest are filled with it; there is always something &gt;weighty, new, piquant, profound. He is a well of knowledge, but he &gt;quotes Homer and Horace ad nauseam. His wit and his sallies are like &gt;Attic salt. He is sensitive and generous, but displease him in the &gt;slightest and he is unpleasant, vindictive, and detestable. He believes &gt;in nothing except what is most incredible, being superstitious about &gt;everything. He loves and lusts after everything. ... He is proud &gt;because he is nothing. ... Never tell him you have heard the story he &gt;is going to tell you. ... Never omit to greet him in passing, for the &gt;merest trifle will make him your enemy.

Furthermore, he is essentially a living proof of building yourself up to be an attractive man

&gt;He would be a good-looking man if he were not ugly; he is tall and built &gt;like Hercules, but of an African tint; eyes full of life and fire, but &gt;touchy, wary, rancorous—and this gives him a ferocious air. It is easier &gt;to put him in a rage than to make him gay. He laughs little, but makes &gt;other laugh.

Plus, the story is a great read. Dude had a crazy life.

&gt;He was, by vocation and avocation, a lawyer, clergyman, military officer, violinist, con man, pimp, gourmand, &gt;dancer, businessman, diplomat, spy, politician, medic, mathematician, social philosopher, cabalist, playwright, &gt;and writer.

Remember, unstable platform applies to both parties involved, so there should be a lot of misses!  But don't count on the bad guys being unlucky.

Also remind them during the shootout mid-way through the session.  They need to hit the dirt.  The enemies should react based on how the situation is going.  If the players are being smart and lucky, maybe they'll also take cover.  If not they'll stand in the open and be easy targets.

For the final fight, the big bad has some really high toughness.  Remind them that he's +2 to hit and they can make called shots.  Head for -2 (net) to hit and +4 to damage.  Eye for -4 (net) to hit and +4 to damage AND negates armor.  Once you realize this, the big baddie doesn't seem that tough.

I got him to see a doctor about it, but he kept on accusing me of stupid shit I didn't do, and he kept telling me I wasn't his friend.

It was too much.  So the ""break up"" happened.  I just was done.  He accused me of being a bad wife to my husband cause I left him while I went to see my family for Thanksgiving, then he said I liked my family better then him and tried to get me to spend the weekend with him instead of them.  I was done, that was the final straw. I told him EVERYTHING.  I let him know how abusive and horrible he'd been to me for fucking 9 years!  

He must of thought this was just another fight cause he tried to talk to me after that like nothing happened, but got no response.  He got his MOM to call me once.  Nope, not going back to him.  After I told our mutual friends the situation, turns out they all hated him too for how he treated me, and how childish he was, and were only his friend because of me, so he was done.  I took our friends in the ""divorce"".  It was a rough breakup and he used all the tools in his manipulative box to lure me back, but I am not having it.

He's a bit of a clown, but I can't think of any other writer that *instigates* a person to read as strongly as Bloom does (except maybe Hazlitt).

"c9luway","Oh, not at all. I understand what you meant. :) You're expressing what you feel. If I may continue the conversation, maybe it will help?

The reason that noticing the glaring faults in the world is not realistic is because you're *only* looking at the faults in the world, when there is so much to enjoy here. Frankly, life is better than it ever has been in world history. We live long, have better health, more reasons to live (be it pleasure, fixing those problems, or dreams), are more educated, have pain killers, and we also have thousands of years of history, thought and legacy to draw from to make our personal lives better. And most people in the world are nice, friendly, happy and generous, but not 100% of the time and that's all. Judging them by the 5% they are upset isn't fair.

You are a human. How is hating what you are rational when hating yourself turns you into what you hate the most? 

Maybe you *are* a disappointed idealist. You said yourself you don't do everything to solve these problems, but you get mad when others don't either. Is that really fair? Ghandi said you need to be the change you want to see. So, I have to ask, have you given up on trying to be what you wish the world was?

And I have to disagree strongly with this idea: ""acknowledging these problems and caring/worrying about them is the first step towards changing things for the better"" The first step is to care about each other, treat each other like we matter, help others become what they were meant to be. People grow like plants; they need nourishment. If we could allow every human to be safe and at peace with themselves, I doubt there'd be any major problems left to solve.

1.) True. But you are not everyone. It's not your job to solve the world's problems, nor is it your job to mourn the problems that get unsolved. Justifying the pain in the world by making yourself miserable is not worth it.

4.) This is the same problem as above. You're seeing the flaws and only the flaws. You're not just seeing them, you're letting those thoughts consume your opinions of the world. No one likes the guy who sees only flaws. You think other people are not aware that these problems exist? Adults are all painfully aware of the harshness of the world. But the happy ones also find reasons to be happy.

6.) I might have explained this poorly. I meant mental discipline, controlling your body and thoughts because they are yours and you choose what you want them to do with enough practice. You don't have to ""ignore"" problems, but focusing your mind to concentrate on relevant things...things YOU can change...that is what I meant. It is a waste of energy to worry about global warming, but not so much as worrying is your local park is clean.

There was a line from A Christmas Carole...when Jacob Marley visits Scrooge, he says ""There was something about mankind that I loved....mankind was my business..."" something like that.

"c9jja4m","Our party of six, myself an Eladrin Avenger, Gnome Druid, Dragonborn Barbarian, Shardmind Bard, Human Rouge, and Human Psion all waltz into this town’s great cathedral of Corellon to return some dead npc’s body.  While there we were respectfully interrogated and asked to hand over a magical necklace the party had found, as it was stolen church property.  My characters, a follower of Corellon obliged without much fuss and the party went on its’ way.  

After staying in two separate taverns for the night (due to a drunken altercation) we rejoined in the morning in the town square promptly to be found by the church watch with a warrant for my arrest on charge of suspicion of theft.  Our bard was allowed to come with me as an attorney for a hearing the following day.  Aware of my own innocence I don’t resist and the rest of the party mentions they’ll visit during hours later.  They never do. 

At 3am in the morning the door to our generous, but isolated prison quarters is opened.  A lower acolyte and our dragonborn enter.  We quickly see that the barbarian has insanely been able to pass as a higher member of the church from a distant congregation sent to speak with my character due to my noble lineage.  We get a second to speak alone, and learn the druid in our party had snuck out and re-stolen the necklace the prior evening for her own purposes, and now wants to break us out to remove the risk of her being called in to witness.  

Now the bard and I remain unconvinced of this course of action, I mean the two of us are actually innocent of any crime.  However, just as we’re about to tell our Barbarian to leave, the arch-bishop arrives, alerted by other guards.  All diplomatic and bluff attempts fail epically and in a last ditch attempt to now escape, the barbarian’s cover blown, we make a sprint for the door and try to throw this feeble old man to the ground, locking him in behind.  The barbarian rolls…..a critical fail.

The surprisingly agile arch-bishop grapples the barbarian and pushes him off balance and then all three of us are trapped.  Our quick thinking shardmind manages to teleport of the room, and goes to trip the bishop from behind…..another cit fail.  With armed guards pouring into the dungeon level of the cathedral we gave up any attempt at escape.  What followed the next session was a six-hour trial presided over by an all-prescient being summoned from the netherworlds.    While we tried to call the rogue and Psion to the stand for witness, church search parties turned up empty handed.  While not charged guilty of theft, we were all charged with assault of higher order clergy and attempted deception, excommunicated from the church, and sold into slavery at auction.

Our two human companions meanwhile had attempted to assault a base (scenario intended for the full party) instead of coming to our aid at trial and were both grievously wounded.  In the following 48 hours in game, our psion was killed in a single hit and resurrected by us at the expense of all our gold, only to be killed again, with our rogue, in a preemptive attempt to raid a wizard’s house alone at night contrary to the group’s plans.   
 
Though we’ve joined up with their newly created characters, our parties luck has not improved an we’ve  consistently rolled so poorly resulting in burned loot, people fall out of trees, and  other people falling into wells, and a 100% rate of failed dungeroneering checks.  We are quite possibly the worst adventurers ever.

"c9c7nft","There is a study that challenges your notion that Liberals ""value fairness""

Are Republicans stingy but principled while Democrats are generous but racist?

""I wouldn't put it quite so starkly,"" said Stanford University professor Shanto Iyengar. He would prefer to call Democrats ""less principled"" rather than bigoted, based on his analysis of data collected in a recent online experiment that he conducted with The Washington Post and washingtonpost.com.

As reported in this column a few weeks ago, the study found that people were less likely to give extended aid to black Hurricane Katrina victims than to white ones. The race penalty, on average, totaled about $1,000 per black victim.

As Iyengar and his colleagues subsequently dug deeper into these data, another finding emerged: Republicans consistently gave less aid, and gave over a shorter period of time, to victims regardless of race.

Democrats and independents were far more generous; on average, they gave Katrina victims on average more than $1,500 a month, compared with $1,200 for Republicans, and for 13 months instead of nine.

But for Democrats, race mattered -- and in a disturbing way. Overall, Democrats were willing to give whites about $1,500 more than they chose to give to a black or other minority. (Even with this race penalty, Democrats still were willing to give more to blacks than those principled Republicans.) ""Republicans are likely to be more stringent, both in terms of money and time, Iyengar said. ""However, their position is 'principled' in the sense that it stems from a strong belief in individualism (as opposed to handouts). Thus their responses to the assistance questions are relatively invariant across the different media conditions. Independents and Democrats, on the other hand, are more likely to be affected by racial cues.""",1365583067,"there is a study that challenges your notion that liberals ""value fairness""  are republicans stingy but principled while democrats are generous but racist?","generous but racist","generous","but",FALSE,"generous but racist","racist",NA,NA,1

I've worked in the Vegas casino industry for the past 10 years. We get the real scoop on what these celebs are really like. Was telling friends for years that Tiger Woods was a PR disaster waiting to happen, which they never believed til it did.

Just some quick observations:

Phelps is a douche. He is totally opposite of his public persona. In reality he is that dude from the ""pretty fly for a white guy"" video.

Tiger Woods is infamous in Vegas. So many stories about what a prick he has been to everyone over the years.

The three big name Bulls from their championship run... Jordan, Pippen, Rodman.... jerks. Pippen is known as ""No Tippin' Pippen"". It's not just about the tips, these aren't nice people.

There are also some surprises. I always imagined Jennifer Lopez was a total bitch.... exact opposite turned out to be true, and that ass is even more amazing in person. Marc Antony was drunk off his butt and bouncing around to pull every slot handle he could get his mitts on while she has to follow him around like a babysitter... needless to say fans followed them everywhere and kept pestering them... she was nice and smiley with every single one of the in a situation that most celebs would have been telling people to fuck off.

"c8nxvo0","Well I think some other people would have more to contribute as far as ""proper"" meal plans for keto, but here's what I've been doing (in general, this is just an average day for me). 

Firstly, I try to make the volume of leafy greens equate the volume of protein (not mass, mind you: just filling up at least half of my plate with romaine, spinach, or kale). 

My favorite breakfast is a bowl of romaine lettuce (as much lettuce as maybe 150% the size of my fist) with some (generous, but conscious of the caloric intake) blue cheese dressing. I cut up half a meduim Hass avocado (they're 50c at the store here in TX) and top the salad. Then a drizzling of sriracha. Then 3 sunny side up eggs laid over it (surprisingly, the yolk tastes great over this salad). Then.... BACON (3-5 slices). Usually this comes out to ~800 calories and constitutes the majority of my daily calories. I can't finish it. Maybe I should cut an egg and some bacon out of it. The bowl just looks so ***manly***, though, with all that awesome shit on it. 

My lunch is the romaine or spinach salad (same liberal amount of greens, maybe a different style dressing) with sides of deli meats and cheeses (mostly paying attention to the amount of calories). Sometimes I grab a cheddar jalapeno sausage (or something of the like) instead of the meats and cheeses (making sure to get fat in there). Usually between 400-500 cals. usually I can finish this, but sometimes I can't. 

My dinner is a salad of the same sort (different dressings, maybe, but still greens and such). If I feel I've been slacking on my fat intake, I throw bacon on it (or just have bacon strips with dinner). Then a pork chop (we just have a lot of pork right now), but I'd gladly do a steak, chicken, or venison in place of this. I'd assume this hits about 700-800 cal, but I never finish all my meals, so I'm not worried about it. This is about an hour after I finish my workout, so I eat between 5-6 pm. 

I work out 5x a week for about 2 hr/day. I'm stuffed ALL THE TIME, and still don't hit 2000 calories (usually). I've lost 6 pounds in 3 days and have been slamming myself in the gym, seeing large percentage gains similar to the post. I'm still running 1.5 hrs a week and not seeing a lull in energy. My lifting has *felt* weaker, but the numbers are speaking for themselves in my opinion, so I'm not sweating it. 

As for the ""plan"", just do two things: cut out sugars and starchy carbs (any carbs you get should probably come from your leafy greens and have plenty of fiber) and make sure you get plenty of fat and protein. I'm not even counting calories anymore, because I found that if I actually *ate* 2000 calories on this plan, I'd never stop shitting. I literally can't eat that much, and I'm a fat kid. Yesterday I went to BJ's Brewhouse and had the Grilled Pork Chops with double veggies (~900 calories). I devoured it (I just got back from a 3 hour workout; I had missed a day) and immediately wanted to throw up. It was just 2 pork chops with maybe 4-6 oz of steamed veggies. It's so easy to cut calories and keep your protein up on this shit. I'm ecstatic about how easy it is to be full on this diet.

Islam teaches the immaculate conception, the Ten Commandments, and several other teachings that are identical to both Judaism and Christianity, but we ignore those.

As you can imagine, each assignment was based on their potential skill levels. Some were told to capture the feather of an owl while it was hunting prey. This was possible only because of a grove a few miles away the some owls lived in.

Others were told to steal a sapphire from the other schools idols. This tested their stealth and mobility. The final task always came down to peanuts. You would think getting peanuts is no big deal, but these were very rare, highly treasured, and extremely guarded by none other than the Emperor's personal guard. The students would have to get into the palace, deal with the guards, break into the personal storage room, and bring back the peanuts without breaking any of the shells. Needless to say, this was reserved only for the most skilled applicants.

"c8bz2k9","THE HOUSE EXPANDED. I don't just mean literally -- obviously I had displayed some excellent abilities with regards to stretching out space, so any time more space was needed, it was easy to provide in that sense. We're now into 1998 and this was a year I made a lot of friends.

Mina, Tess, and Ceylon. As I've mentioned, we had a pretty established process of inviting over ""guests"" and then sometimes some would stay, and out of this particular group the three who stuck were Mina, Tess, and Ceylon. I was initially most interested in meeting Tess, but it was Mina who came to be the most important person to me, and Ceylon who became an inspiration to everyone.

Tess was slighty, an airhead. Sweet and generous, but oh my, the best word to describe her is ""fluffy.""

Mina, by contrast, was quiet and introspective -- and quickly managed to befriend Tin, who was always standing guard in the corner, because they shared that appreciation of being still and quiet. Mina had feelings for Tess but hadn't acted on them.

Ceylon was bold and adventurous, practical, easygoing, highly capable, and made her services available to Jakob. Ceylon was a ""life of the party"" type of person and didn't like suffering. She considered it her duty to pull people out of their ruts. While Ceylon and Mina hadn't been more than acquaintances prior to arriving, they ended up working together and becoming friends because Ceylon also took an interest in Tin.

But Mina became Important. I'm not entirely sure how to explain it. At one point early on I was sitting on my bed next to Mina, who was watching Tess, and just felt this bond. Soulmates. I don't mean in a romantic sense in the slightest -- Mina was definitely only after Tess -- it was like Mina was part of my soul that had been missing. We understood each other, we could feel one another, we were very different people but somewhere in our core beings, we were the same.

We were also both missing something, and it wasn't until the following year that we would find out what, or more exactly, who.

Serena.

Mina and I saw Serena together and decided we had to rescue her. There was just no other alternative. She had been treated very badly by her story and together we reached out and pulled her away from it. She was the third part, the missing thing. Again, totally different personality from me and from Mina, but we knew she belonged with us. I was loud and energetic, Mina was strong and silent, and Serena was sad and lonely. We were all sad and lonely in a way, because as much as we had friends around us who were wonderful and compassionate and loved us, they didn't come from the same place as us and somehow we did come from the same place. From then on, me, Mina, and Serena were this trio of people closer than made sense. Three in one, birds of a feather.

It would be remiss of me not to briefly mention the wonderful Dr. Bremen, who came to visit and stayed the same year I met Mina, Ceylon, and Tess. Bremen's responsible for medical care around here.

"c85qffw","I applaud what seems like the first intelligent comment from you in this thread. 

Listen, I am anti-war -- I was against the stupidity in Iraq, and am fully against any acts of aggression towards Iran. But the past oh, 30+ years of history have not exactly been great for US-Iran relations. I actually love the country and the people of Iran, but I dislike its government and its rulers. I think it is a progressive nation stuck behind the veil of theocracy.

I am also against the Israeli occupation and think Israel is one of the top human rights' violators in the world. What it has done to the Palestinian people is hard to forgive, but of course the healing can only begin with relinquishing settlements, ending all occupation, and recognizing statehood. 

Obviously none of this is easy, and we're not going to hash out these problems in the Reddit comments.

My original comment to you, which started this, was taking issue with you saying ""nothing was said about the pyramids."" No, something was said. Will anything ever happen? Of course not. Morsi may be many bad things, but one thing he seems to be is a pragmatist, not a true zealot. Then you said the Salafis were an irrelevant minority; I provided you with multiple links showing they were not. Then you tried to explain the movement away; again, I addressed that. We are now far, far off topic.

However, I'll say this: with respect to the Salafis/Wahhabis in Egypt, I am sure there are many who are kind and generous, but unfortunately there are also **many** who are intolerant, cannot countenance Christianity, atheism, homosexuality in Egypt, and are not afraid to use violence when it suits them. I won't spend my day sending you links, but there is plenty of evidence that with Mubarak gone, Egypt has become even less welcoming for minorities. And the reason for that is a noticeable and public (and statistical) uptick in Salafi/Wahhabi influence, which can be seen in the media as well as in parliament.

I won't scrutinize these views on their merits. Salafis, Hindus, Christians, Jews, whomever, can believe what they want. But when the belief extends beyond the individual and starts to influence the environment and others against their will, that pisses me off. Unfortunately, that's what's happening in Egypt. I am not just some couchsurfing American FOX NEWS watcher. I have been to Egypt, know Arabic, have read the Quran, and have many friends in Egypt and elsewhere in that region. So take my assessment for what it's worth -- Egypt is in far greater peril with its current influences than America ever was with the (truly nominal) ""influence"" of people like Pat Freaking Robertson.",1359483578,"however, i'll say this: with respect to the salafis/wahhabis in egypt, i am sure there are many who are kind and generous, but unfortunately there are also **many** who are intolerant, cannot countenance christianity, atheism, homosexuality in egypt, and are not afraid to use violence when it suits them.","kind and generous","generous",NA,FALSE,"kind and generous","kind",NA,NA,0

I reason it's because most of the populace here (the reddest state in the union) worships the idea of ""rugged individualism"", and generally not being a ""bleeding heart liberal"". Kind of makes sense in that Oklahoma was the last contiguous state to be settled, mostly by European immigrants who did what they had to to survive to get here.

"c7ygolq","At the moment, no.

I have liked the current DLC enough so far, seeing as I already paid for it ahead of time I might as well get all out of it that I can for now. But the trend in DLC they are having is what is most disappointing. 

**1) Gameplay time/DLC length.** Maybe it's because I played all these DLCs with my lvl50 Mechro that is my favorite and best build with a good number of legendaries and purples to boot, but I felt all these DLCs were just a bit on the short side. Big Game Hunt especially. I would like to see something on the level of General Knoxx, even with my fully leveled character it took me two good days of playing to complete it. I also did that on xbox *and* pc. Yes, I loved that DLC so much that when I moved from xbox to pc, I bought it again. 

**2) Raid Bosses.** Honestly, they are not a bad idea, but I think there is way too much focus on them now. It feels like we as a community pressured the team into making these raid bosses so we had more difficult bosses to kill. More stuff to loot. While these bosses are a nice challenge one in a while, they are not the essence of the game, and I would like to see a DLC now that just has no raid boss so no one has to focus in the slightest on it. A repeatable loot quest perhaps on par with General Knoxxs armory even, even though that was glitched. Something that involves a quest to get good loot instead of just one boss. 

**3) Level Cap Increase.** I am personally fine without this for the last dlc in this season pass, but perhaps one nice big dlc in a couple months here that includes raising the cap to 60 would be best. Have enough content for current 50s to level almost all the way to 60 in the dlc alone. Either way, I think whatever increases level cap needs to be a separate dlc from any season pass, and needs to be part of a really content-rich dlc as well, seeing as people will be losing the usefulness of all their hard earned and precious legendaries. I would be fine with that personally, my collection becoming fairly useless again. Gives me something to strive for again. 

**4) New Character Class?** I for one wouldn't really mind a new class never coming out. I got through the first Borderlands just fine with 4 classes and now with 5 in this game I am more than content. Hell, Gaige is my favorite character and best build in either game. A new character class certainly adds something very nice to the game, instead of just another round of bosses and quests you get a whole other way of playing the game. Many, actually, depending on the build you choose. For those who actually like leveling a character and experiencing that process as well as all the different ways to play a new class, this without a doubt adds the most unique gameplay time to the game for us. I don't think it would hurt to add one more character class...but I am also just fine with the current 5.

"c7r10rz","&gt;&gt; why are people without?

Best book to read for the answers is proverbs but two reasons

1. Laziness Proverbs 6:6-11; 10:4; 13:11; 14:23; 20:4; 20:21

Proverbs 19:24 The sluggard buries his hand in the dish, But will not even bring it back to his mouth

I have met people like this even have some family like this, I have had tenets like this too. Basically just to lazy to bother to take care of themselves always mooching off others.

2. Wickedness and Injustice basically Oppression most often  by governments and other thieves.

Proverbs 13:21; 13:23; 14:31; 15:6; 15:27; 16:8; 17:8?; 22:16; 22:2; 28:8

Favorite being 

 Proverbs 13:23 A poor man's field may produce abundant food, but injustice sweeps it away.

Basically without thieves( including government) most (over 90% ) people would be able to fend for themselves.

&gt;&gt; the church does so much less than it should

This will always be true of course but giving material assistance is just relieving a symptom poverty is a spiritual battle against sloth and greed (most often government greed).

If I feed a lazy man tomorrow he is still lazy and still hungry. If I help to stop being lazy I have really solved the problem. Of this is much harder and is only possible through the grace of God.

Likewise if a man lives under oppression from thieves, warlords, dictators etc any material aid I give him is just temporary relief the only way to fix the problem is to eliminate the oppression.

Temporary poverty relief is noble and generous but honestly it does more for the giver then the receiver. You can't solve poverty through hand outs, often hand outs create dependency. 

If you increased welfare benefits, you will see more people on welfare not less.

&gt;&gt; ""I donated""

Again depends on what you donate your time is better then your money if throwing money at problems worked government wouldn't look and be as incompetent as it is.

&gt;&gt; there isn't anything wrong with being rich or even middle class

There isn't anything wrong with these things but material comfort does provide significant spiritual challenge to your relationship with God as the ascetics wisely know. Hence why we are asked to fast from food and sleep to deny our material comfort to grow closer to God.
 
&gt;&gt; developed countries 

Built riches on injustice and all western countries have systemic debt problems mortgaging the children future for their own gain they will know poverty again because they behaved immorally.

"c78s5go","I played a halfling paladin in a campaign that lasted for over a year that I consider to be my best character ever. He started out barely more than a teenager and in the bottom ranks of his church. He was kind and generous but also shy, quiet, and a bit socially awkward; he also wasn't much of a leader and sometimes froze up when he had to make difficult decisions (like when he had to decide whether or not to kill his friend who was being tortured by drow - he didn't and the friend never forgave him). 

Still, he was absolutely loyal to both his friends and his god, although he didn't necessarily always hold 100% to the tenets of his church - he once lied to the police to protect his best friend, for example. Later on, after a massive attack on his church by the cult of Shar where almost everyone was killed while he was away, he discovered that he was the highest-ranking official left, making him the de facto leader. Rather than stepping up and doing his duty by his god, he avoided it in any way possible due to his anxiety and his feeling that he wasn't good enough. It was a source of a lot of stress and character growth for him, especially when international higher-ups in the church sent a bishop to reprimand him.

He followed Ilmater (the Forgotten Realms god of self-sacrifice and altruism) because he felt that his teachings of compassion meant a lot to him personally. He tried not to start fights and preferred to talk, but he was deadly with a longbow when it came to it. (Halfling archer paladins in Pathfinder are a little OP.) He grew up in an orphanage and was mentored by the nurse there, so he learned to heal the sick with great skill even without divine magic; he could often be found in the sick chambers of the temple to Ilmater caring for the unfortunate.

I realize this isn't necessarily that helpful, but your question reminded me of this character and I just felt like writing it out. He was a very autobiographical character who I had a personal connection to; I was pretty sad when that campaign ended. We might go back and do a follow-up with those characters 5-10 years in the future, which would be awesome.

"c745zy8","**My first boyfriend** had a crush on me for a year before we went out. He was in the year below me at school and we started going out when I was 15 and he was 14. He was about 5'8"" ish, chunky build (teeny bit chubby) and had dark eyes and dark, curly hair (which I was a real sucker for at the time). He was a bit nerdy, liked games and the internet, was intelligent and made me laugh. As a person he was lovely; kind, sweet, generous, but a bit of a doormat and he let me walk all over him and be a bit of a tyrant whenever I felt like it (I had a lot of anger as a teenager). At the time I thought we were In Love, but looking back now I'm not so sure; I think I loved the idea of him more and used him as an emotional crutch whilst he became more distant. We broke up at 19/18 after 4 and 1/2 years together when I left for uni and then I was single for 3 years (didn't even sleep with anyone). I've since apologised for the way I sometimes treated him and we're on good terms but don't talk.  

**My present boyfriend** is quite similar to my first in terms of humour and interests (he plays a lot of PC games), but he's a bit taller and slimmer, has dirty blonde hair and greeny-brown eyes. He's 22 (again a year younger than me) but is like a grumpy, stubborn old man which I find absolutely hilarious. He is also kind, sweet and generous (though not so obviously as the first due to the grumpiness) and impressively emotionally resilient (something awful happened when he was 15 and he hasn't let it take over his life like it did for his brother and sister) however I sometimes worry he just blocks stuff out. He's a little more closed off emotionally than I would like but I think that's just the way he is and because of what's happened to him; he's quite private and says if he wanted to talk about anything he would, but he just doesn't have anything to say. He is impossible to manipulate and won't take any shit, which is awesome because if I start creeping back into my old ways when I get angry (hardly ever happens nowadays) he puts a stop to it straight away in a calm and reasonable way and has therefore helped me improve as a person. He's brilliant at reading me and knowing what I need from him (if I'm stressed, he cuddles me etc), and we're very compatible in what we want from life. We've only been going out a year but we're quite serious and have discussed marriage etc if we're still together in a few years. He would make an awesome husband/father. He's not as intellectually ambitious as I am; I'm on my way to becoming a research microbiologist, he's in his last year at uni studying ICT. He really enjoys the HR side of it and just wants to work in an office, doesn't even care what sort of company. Despite that he's still very smart and I like the way he looks at the world. I'm in love with him for real and it feels so different to the first guy. I love making him happy and try to be as loving as possible towards him.

"c716xnx","I think you’ve misinterpreted my example. A personal sacrifice “out of bravery” is satisfied most immediately in the proper moral response to fear, which is itself for the sake of *eudaimonia* or the attainment of happiness. These would be *some* of the relevant units of analysis, as you put it, from the virtue ethical perspective. And yet, it’s difficult to see why sacrificing your life can be for your own good, and therefore explain why the self-declared objectives of virtue theory are not self-defeating. For example, Aristotle says the following: 

&gt;It is true, concerning the good person, that for the sake of his friends and his country he will do much, and die for them if necessary; he will sacrifice money and honours, and in general goods that are fought over, obtaining for himself the fine. He will choose a short period of intense pleasure rather than a long period of mild pleasure, and choose to live finely for a year rather than for many years in an ordinary way, and choose one action which is fine and great rather than many small ones. This is certainly true of those who die for others; they choose for themselves what is great and fine. (1169a)

Aristotle is not claiming here that the larger benefit to others (or its ultimate consequences) is the exclusive reason for making a personal sacrifice, but the idea that one may secure more of what is “great and fine” for oneself in a single glorious moment of death than in a life-time of untroubled happiness. If we accept that argument, then virtue ethics is not self-defeating. I find this line of reasoning hard to swallow personally, which is why I said the virtuous person “may be required to make sacrifices contradicting their attainment of happiness.” However, this wasn’t the substance of my original argument: the claim that value is multifaceted and irreducible to consequences. You appear to have evaded this point entirely. Take the case of self-sacrifice outlined so far. What I think you should notice is that the consequences remain inseparable, and would be inexplicable without, an account of the originary source of value in the virtuous person. The brute fact that a person died for others in military combat, for example, tells us nothing about the internal state of the agent, or the warrantability of their death under the circumstances. For one thing, their demise may have been an unfortunate accident, or something entirely unintended. It’s also possible that they simply miscalculated the risks and acted foolishly, rather than bravely. While deaths like these are often tragic, we have no knowledge of whether they were properly virtuous, and therefore good, in the required senses.  

It might help to reinforce this point by proposing another case. Consider an act of generosity between two people. If we evaluate the value of this action, as per your position, we would need only account for the fact that certain goods or benefits were consensually transferred to another without compensation, or the presumed positive effects promoted by those goods or benefits (short- or long-term). Is that the end of the story from your perspective? Or don’t you think it’s more complicated? On the virtue ethical reading, we simply wouldn’t be in a position to judge the moral goodness or praiseworthiness of generosity without taking into consideration the nature and extent of the gift, the disposition of the donor, or the deservingness of the recipient. Giving away all your money, for example, wouldn’t be generous but wasteful and improvident, and therefore a vice rather than a virtue. Similarly, if a person suddenly decided to give away a portion of their wealth, but had been greedy for most of their life, they wouldn’t be generous either, since they would lack the appropriate disposition or habit of giving necessary for virtue. Likewise, it wouldn’t be generous if the gift were exchanged between undeserving parties; e.g., parents who leave their inheritance to the men of the family to the exclusion of the women, for no other reason than the fact that they are men. It would be my view that the consequences are meaningless without these types of qualifications. 

I don’t see what you could possibly say that would persuade me to believe that the consequences are the exclusive and ultimate source of value or the sole reason we do the things that we do. If this were the case we wouldn’t seem to have much reason to hesitate from butchering people for organ transplants or squashing political protests for the benefit of the state. You can always try to make the argument that there are unforeseen consequences involved, but I don’t believe that would support your case. For one thing, people could carry out the most heinous of crimes, so long as it promoted the “greater good,” without the deed ever coming to public awareness, or of anyone besides the victims being adversely affected. Collectively and probabilistically, as you say, there would be a net advantage, but that wouldn’t efface the perpetration of evil. The fact is that some of the most monstrous events in world history have been premised under this kind of assumption; e.g., the imperial conquests of Rome, the ethnic cleansings of the national socialist party, the forced sterilizations of the eugenics movement.

"c6js4f0","&gt;""humanity"" is an imaginary construct idiotic people use to counter logic

Humanity is just a construct? Emotions are just constructs? I suppose your frustration is merely a construct, too? The central issue in this discussion is quality of life; it's why we talk about economics, social effects, etc. It hinges on quality of life. My point is that money isn't an issue to those of us who have been in this situation. Of the several hundred parents I've spoken with who have children with Downs, I've never heard any of them say they'd have it any different. Surely there are exceptions, but that's certainly not the rule. Unless, of course, you could bust out some awesome logic and statistics to prove otherwise. My guess is you can't.

&gt;People who don't like when people say people changed the world when they didn't?

Well, I consider myself part of this world, and I consider all the thousands of people who knew her and my family part of this world, so, yes, she did indeed change the world. For the better!

&gt;ALL THE PROBLEMS WOULD HAVE GONE AWAY. Also this mentality that she was 'better' because she was disabled.

Definitely never said that, but she certainly made the world better during her life than you're making it now. She was better in many ways than me and people like me. I get angry far too easily; too impatient; I'm often not kind and generous. But she was all the time. She could be selfish, but it was rare. I'm guessing she was more patient and kind than a lot of people in this thread, too.

&gt;I never said anything about the worth of people with disabilities.

Everything you're saying deals with the worth of people with disabilities. Was she worth having? Did her existence affect this world? I don't think there's any doubt she affected it, and for the better. Are you really getting so worked up because I think she affected the world? What exactly is your argument?

Broad scheme of things? What ""broad scheme""? You clearly have an image in your mind of how things ought to work, so, please, enlighten me.

And the thing is, the labels aren't bad at all. (Except ""throuple"". That one needs to die in a fire.) A label for a partner, friend, or lover should be three things; simple, descriptive, and generous. Someone who hears it should know what it means without additional explanation, there should be relatively little or no confusion about the relationship so described, and it should make the other person so labeled feel good.

""Sexual partner"" fails - it's simple, it's descriptive, but it's not generous.
""Boyfriend/Girlfriend"" is simple, and it's reasonably descriptive, but many people think of it as being childish, more associated with teenagers and young adults. It is generous, however.
""Lover"" works - simple, descriptive, and generous.
""Significant Other"" - simple, descriptive, not very generous. It does have the advantage of being descriptive of the relationship but not the person, which is particularly handy in group situations.
""Partner"" - simple, descriptive, generous.

The trouble is when we as poly folk want to create labels that mean the same things as existing labels but for our specific situations. This is difficult because other, non-poly folk won't know what they mean; by default, the labels we create may be simple and generous but they will fail as descriptive labels because others won't have pictures for them.

"c671hme","While I feel like your intentions are good, I think your policies might put you at risk for creating the type of one-dimensional female characters you're trying to avoid. Most of these have to do with physical beauty and sexuality which even though interactions between men and women are more complicated than that, physical appearances do matter, and men and women alike are sexualized to some extent. How women act in response to this reveals a lot about their character, and requiring there be some sort of in-story purpose for them to be sexual or attractive, in my opinion, would only limit both the character and the story. An attractive woman would see their world--and thus act--differently than an unattractive, average, or even equally attractive woman might. 

For example, a naturally beautiful woman might be kind and generous but without true empathy. She could also react to situations with naivety or general ignorance. An unattractive person could vent to her about being ignored or treated terribly, and she--the character--could come to the conclusion that the friend simply has an abrasive personality or done something wrong because she has never been treated that way. She could also react immaturely to off-the-cuff comments or criticisms against her. (Think Jon Hamm's character from 30 Rock, if you've ever watched it.)

An unattractive woman might have incredibly low self-esteem that prevents her from pursuing her dreams, despite demonstrating amazing potential. As a result, she could have a lot of subconscious resentment against people in general. On the other hand, an average looking women might be more sympathetic to unattractive looking people while being unsympathetic to attractive characters because she doesn't feel like they have any ""legitimate"" reason to complain. 

A woman who was only attractive because of elective plastic surgery or something might come off as your stereotypical Mary Sue, but it could turn out that she is incredibly insecure, emotionally weak, and primarily concerned with being validated, so she downplays all of her flaws and encouraging all sorts of social cliches and stereotypes to convince people that she's ""perfect."" You could put her in a situation where her physical appearance is meaningless, and watch her frantically changing everything about herself to fit in or be adored. 

The possibilities are basically endless. As far as male characters go, there's nothing wrong with having a sexist or immature protagonist as long as it's not their defining characteristic. Maybe the male character actively seeks out attractive women, but the important question is why. You could have a  physically repulsive guy who's clinging onto the hope that having a beautiful girl on his arm will make people respect him or see him differently, or it could be something as shallow as having an attractive guy who only pursues equally attractive women.

**tl;dr** I completely agree with focusing on your characters' motivations. However, I feel like you're putting too much emphasis on physical beauty and sexuality when it comes to motivation, to the point that subverting sexist tropes is the only way to make a three-dimensional character. 

I'm one of those people who thinks the story is secondary to the characters within them, and thus I disagree with the idea that attractive or sexualized women should only exist if the story itself calls for it. I think that doing that will limit you as a writer, and you risk your story becoming overly preachy and your characters one-dimensional. 

The questions that you're asking (""Is he primarily motivated by her looks? Is she using her looks to hide personality flaws she has?"") feels shallow--for lack of a better word--to me. I almost don't care whether or not she's using her looks to hide personality flaws or if he's primarily motivated by her appearances. To me, it's more important to understand *why* these characters have these motivations. Is he just a dick? Why does she feel the need to hide her personality. All that good stuff.

If you want to write actual people, then my advice would be to not even think about the character's gender, at least on the first or second draft--figure out who they are first before assigning them a gender. At the end of the day, who is Character A? What are they like? What are their strengths and weakness? What is their motivation? Why? Who is Character B? Are they sexist? How do they interact with Character A versus Character C? How would *those* characters react to being treated that way? etc.

I feel like as as you develop these characters in your mind, their genders will become clear, and you will end up with a more three-dimensional character.

Fannie and Freddie acted like Wall Street banks and took in huge amounts of money trading in the same securities that brought down the entire financial world. Their business was simply guaranteeing certain mortgages that the private sector wrote, which would lower the risks associated with writing these mortgages, making it cheaper for mortgage lenders and traders to do business. Fannie and Freddie did not write their own mortgages. As with EVERYONE else in the financial world, their standards lowered as dealing in mortgages, and the securities that were made out of them, became more profitable thanks to the real estate bubble that was pumped up by Alan Greenspan's low interest rates and Bush's tax cuts for the rich.  Please don't bother commenting if you're not even going to take the time to understand what these PRIVATELY RUN AND MANAGED companies did to make money. 
The scandal you're referring to is that, in 2006, it was determined that Fannie and Freddie has overstated earnings for the previous 6 years. For Freddie, it was to the tune of about $6.3 billion. Their numbers were revised, the executives and companies fined, and everyone went on about their business. Regardless of whatever Barney Frank did in support of Fannie and Freddie at that time, how can you possibly tell me that an overstatement of about $11 billion dollars in profits between the two precipitated the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression (which, consequently, was also brought about by your favored economic policies too. Namely, deregulation)? How can $11 billion in overstated profits result in the loss of over $16 trillion in wealth? How do the actions of Freddie and Fannie, which, again, were run privately, with private shareholders and following a private-sector profit model, spill over to the rest of the world's economy if no one else is doing what Fannie and Freddie were doing? You're so zealous to deflect blame from your historic and epic fuck ups that you don't even stop to think whether what you're saying makes ANY sense. Do you even understand what you're saying? Or are you simply just regurgitating what Fox News and the rest of the conservative conspirasphere tell you to say without the slightest comprehension? I'm betting on the latter.

The recession was caused by decades of deregulation and a prevalence of debt, resulting from stagnant wages at the bottom of the economic ladder and cheap debt thanks to Greenspan's low interest rate regime at the Fed, as well as surplus cash on hand with few other means of investment/speculation thanks to Bush's tax cuts for the rich. As money started flowing into housing, the financial industry exploited completely unregulated derivatives (thanks to lobbying done by the financial sector during the Clinton Administration) to securitize and bet on mortgage-backed securities. The problem with securitization was that it disconnected the lenders from the risks inherent in their loans. And as the need for more mortgages grew so the new money machine Wall Street had dreamed up could grow and feed, they pushed the lenders to write more and more mortgages for people who previously couldn't get one, thereby corrupting the previously honorable pursuit of expanding the ownership philosophy into more of the middle class. The borrower simply wanted to get into the middle class and live the American dream. At worst, they figured they could refinance. But lenders made huge amounts of money writing crap mortgages to people they knew couldn't repay and they didn't care because the lenders sold off the mortgages as soon as they wrote them. Banks took all these loans, bundled them into securities, sliced these securities into tranches so investors could own select pieces of these securities, bribed completely incompetent and corrupt ratings agencies to rate these securities as investment-grade crap, and made huge amounts of money selling these products to ignorant investors who trusted that Wall Street knew what it was doing and that the ratings agencies had any clue of how to do their jobs. 

Fannie and Freddie only played a small part in this. The recession is a story of corporate greed, the failings of the private sector and profit motive, and how dangerous both can be when you're stupid enough to believe the market can and will regulate itself. Any other idea, especially this crap that Fannie and Freddie caused the whole thing, is simply the incoherent ramblings of a syphilitic mind.

Counting increased usage of unemployment insurance, food stamps, medicaid, etc. cannot be held against Obama since they are the automatic result of the recession. And you wouldn't even want that to decrease because cutting people off from the lifeline they need to survive only makes the recession worse. The recession was not Obama's fault. Therefore, the automatic spending that goes up because of the recession is not his fault. He has rightly fought to extend unemployment insurance benefits and make food stamps and medicaid more inclusive and generous, but even taking those actions into account, Obama's policies are only responsible for an increase in federal spending of 1.6% over the last four years. That's the slowest growth since Eisenhower. Compare that to GW Bush's 15.4% increase.
http://blogs.detroitnews.com/politics/2012/05/22/federal-spending-under-obama-at-historic-lows/

Meanwhile, tax revenues are at historic lows. Where they normally run between 18-20%, they are down below 15% of GDP. This is entirely the result of of Bush's tax cuts and the lost revenue from the recession you conservatives created.

Of course, I'm jerking you around because ""printing"" money is not how the Federal Reserve controls the money supply. My point in bringing this up at all is that you're too ignorant to know how it all actually works since you rely on conservative fear-mongering and stupidity to think there's all kinds of printing going on and that its undermining anything. Its kind of funny, actually. But it would be funnier if your ignorance was limited to your mom's basement and didn't occasionally find itself in a voting booth.

3. I commented on the conservative mindset as it related to the topic at hand, which had nothing to do with deficits, the recession or the money supply. We were talking about the Volt and gas/oil usage. If you're going to offer up the peanut gallery's perspective, at least keep it topical, not the tangent you went off on because you had already thrown your two cents in on the subject and had been smacked down by people who both know better and have a social and global conscience.

I was just assuming and partly joking with my initial Fox News reference, but then you went and proved my suspicion. Whatever credibility you thought you had before you mentioned Fox News went right out the window when you full-on admitted that's where you get your information. As you can tell from my supporting citations, I get my information from a myriad of sources, all with their own perspective. I'm fine leaving out blatant conservative propaganda with no compunction whatsoever for lying to get it's point across.

Sure, I'll keep going. But in keeping with conservatives' problems with reading anything of length (Bush's one-page daily security briefings, Herman Cain saying no bill should be longer than the Constitution, and continuous bitching about the length of bills and how they don't read them because of it, for just a few examples), you probably just TL:DR'd my whole response.

"c5wf540","Hello young person. I hope that you get something that helps you here. You're going to probably get a mix of messages about forgiveness and finding strength but I'm going to put my own spin on this too. 

&gt;He used to beat my mum. Not terribly, but he did it.

If this was one isolated incident of him having the worst day of his life and your mother also having the worst bender of all time and he had to use some knuckle encouragement to get her to stop from killing you that's one thing. 

Men who hurt women are not my favorite people. I'm pretty far on the ""kick his dick into the dirt until the dirt is sick of that dick"" side of the fence. ""used to beat my mum"" is probably up there with my least favorite things to read.

He's a man. If he's a real man he's going to reach out to you and make that relationship happen. You have an empty place in your life and that's just the facts. I wish there were a way to magic up a healthy relationship but that may never happen. That's one that sucks, but sometimes you have to rip off the band-aid. Hairs and all. 

If you feel strong about this one give it a shot. Do it with a third party. Not a snotty third party though, an impartial one. I'm not sure how old you are or what your resources are, but maybe get in touch with a councilor or a therapist. You basically just want a referee. Someone who can tell you or him to pump the breaks and cool off because you're both going to have a very emotional conversation if it happens. 

The most important thing to know though is that you are not your father. You are not your mother. You are your own person and you're starting your life anew. Whatever it was that made your dad behave the way he did stops here. It's over. You are already showing a lot (not alot) of compassion, consideration, and kindness, and you're going to have a better life. 

I don't mean better in the money sense, that's stupid, people make and lose millions while they're sleeping. Screwed up, I know. I mean *quality* of life. You're not going to let people be hurt on your watch, you're going to be kind and generous but not let people step on you. You're going to love someone and you deserve to be loved back. 

If your mom is still alive talk to her about this, be honest, be ready to hear some hurtful things about your old man. 

In the end, we all make our own decisions and we live with them. If someone here says something that you think helps you make a quality one, then I'm glad. Whether that happens or not though, you have to make your own. 


Your dad doesn't sound like my favorite type of dad, but even he might might have some redeemable qualities. 

Here's the ripping off the band-aid part. If I have an argument with my SO/Girlfriend/Wife/Children and even if I'm in a fervor driven, fever fueled, worst  day of my life state I'm going to go try to make peace before the sun goes down. I apologize, talk it out, let that person know that I know I was being a douche. Not that there's anything wrong with a douche, it's just vinegar and water, but it's good to take personal responsibility. 

This is a ""shaggy dog story"". It's something that goes on way too long but it's done that way to be cathartic because at the end of this story there's a punch line, but not the funny kind. 

Deep breath. Really. Take it. Think about sunsets and rainbows.



Sometimes you have to let somebody go.



Sometimes it can work, but sometimes it doesn't. 

I hope it works for you, but being prepared for it not working is a good thing to have in your toolkit too. Personally, I think give communication a try with a third party there to balance out the emotional fallout one time. One. Then give it 2 years and don't regret anything. Also, I think if your mom is alive you should get her some flowers. They don't have to be expensive, hell, steal them out of a graveyard if you have to (don't. just joking) but you know what I mean. If her husband was beating her, get some flowers for ""no reason"". 

You know the reason. She does too. It's a good thing to happen in the universe. Show mom some love, give dad some patience, and in the end of the day don't tolerate anyone, dad or not dad, who doesn't show love. Life is far, far, far, too short for that.

"c5n36qo","Note:  I'm not a woman and I know this is ""AskWomen"" but I thought I'd chime in on confidence, niceness, etc.

I'd like to make the distinction between ""nice"" and ""good"".  I used to believe they were one and the same, until I had a few experiences that taught me differently:

1. A spiritual teacher of mine kicked me out of our spiritual practice community because I was always late on the rent.  At the time I thought he was an asshole for doing so, but looking back I saw it had an enormously positive effect on me.  So there's an example of being compassionate by causing pain in the short term.  If he'd been a ""nice"" guy I'd still be a freeloader.  But instead, he had the *courage* to do the *good* thing, which happened to be painful.

2.  I ran out of money and spent time homeless on the street.  My mother was really nice, and would never have let that happen and would always send me money or something even though I'd (halfheartedly) beg her not to.  Then she died, and within 6 months my natural trajectory was to hemorrhage money so I naturally ended up homeless.  I went to my dad for money and he said ""no, deal with it"".  Best fucking parenting I could have ever received.  Since that time I spent with no money living off of crap I found in dumpsters, I've been more confident, more honest with myself, had more courage and discipline, and I'm making three digits per hour as a consultant.  I know it must have eaten my dad up to see me living as literally a bum, but he stuck to his guns and, once again, did the less pleasant thing that was in the long run more compassionate.

3.  This wasn't an experience so much as a simple teaching.  After seeing me being sort of pushed over one too many times, a friend of mine (who I think may be a sociopath, but that's an aside) said to me: ""You know, tit-for-tat is the optimal solution to the prisoner's dilemma.""  I did a little research on tit-for-tat and found that it means whenever someone hurts you, the best response is to immediately retaliate in exactly the same way and the same degree as they hurt you.  This principle is borne out in sociology, military theory, and evolutionary biology.  It was also mirrored by that same spiritual teacher, who once said to me ""IntenselyHuman, if someone hits you, hit them back.""  At first I didn't believe either of these guys.  But then I started experimenting with that and immediately experienced an upswing in respect from those around me, which (counterintuitively) led to more peaceful relations with people.

Now my ideal of ""nice"" is to be pleasant and generous, but whenever I encounter what I will call a ""predatory"" person, make it very clear to them that I can and will hurt them if they move on me or any of my friends.  I think this was referred to once as the ""speak softly and carry a big stick"" philosophy.

Women like power.  It's as simple as that.  You can be polite, pleasant, generous, and loving, and be just fine in the women department so long as you keep an eye on your level of power and don't let it get drained away.  One of the reasons so-called ""nice"" guys don't have luck with females is that their ""niceness"" is actually just a policy of continuous appeasement.  A nice guy, when his country is invaded, will welcome his invaders because he's afraid to fight.  A powerful guy, when his country is invaded, will welcome his invaders because he wants to help them learn how stupid they're being for invading other countries.  Subtle, but it makes all the difference.

You are the result of 5 billion years of evolution.  The dichotomy between warfare and peace has existed since the first bacterium bumped into another one eating the same food.

"c5j1u3f","This thread was made for me! I'll give some highlights.    

My inlaws are completely stupid with money. A recent example - the wind blew the screen door off the cabin last fall. It messed up the brickwork and is a weird-sized door so it's almost $5000 to fix. My MIL insists that it has to be some insanely expensive door that insurance won't cover (the door it's replacing is just plain aluminum). Finally gets the check from the insurance company  - Fucking spends it. Door is still broken. Mice and rain can get in where the bricks are broken.   
They both have made pretty decent money for most of their lives and they have almost nothing to show for it. Piece of shit cars, a nice cabin that can't even be in their names or it will get seized, old ratty clothes. They make double what my husband and I make and we have student loan debt and a car payment yet they are always broke and bouncing checks. I keep trying to get them to switch to our credit union because at least the bounce fees would be $10 less per incident but they refuse because it would be a hassle. MIL has had a bit of a gambling problem in the past but we aren't allowed to talk about it because it is supposedly better. She doesn't go to the casino now, she just blows fuckwads of money on scratch tickets. Each time one spends money on something stupid the other does, too, in some sort of passive-aggressive revenge game where everyone loses.   
They just got out of bankruptcy like 3 years ago and still are just as broke as when their checks were garnished. My MIL was here last week and was talking about how she didn't know how she was going to get to work because she doesn't have gas in her car, then she spent her last $15 on beer. W.T.F.    
I gave my FIL a printout showing him that he could save about $300/mo on prescriptions by switching to walmart from walgreens and he had a fit because he just doesn't want to. He has nothing against walmart, does most of his grocery shopping there (well, pays people to shop there for him). Switching prescriptions over would take like 15 minutes worth of phone calls and he's busy smoking pot and watching TV all day. Seriously, he does NOTHING. He weighs like 600 lbs (not exaggerating) and doesn't leave the house.     
My husband was trying to talk to them about the cabin and the very real threat that we'll lose it and they kept insisting that they are ""caught up, current"" etc. They were offended by any implication that they aren't ""right on top of things."" They are 2 years behind. By ""caught up"" they mean ""it's not actually on the verge of being auctioned off."" They don't pay bills until they are threated with collections or eviction or whatever and even then they still don't pay it half the time. A notable exception is cable/internet. That bill is always paid. Priorities.    
They taught my sister-in-law well. For the last 3 months it's like she's following a list of ""worst financial decisions to make when you're in your early 20s."" She has one year left of college and I'm waiting for her to call and say she got pregnant and is dropping out or something equally dumb. She's a full time student with a summer job that ends in august (contract). In may she spent her rent money to fly to alaska for two weeks. Could barely afford to eat when she was there, lived on a box of granola bars. Had to borrow rent money from her parents who can't afford it either but ALWAYS give it to her (and then borrow money from us because their already-3-month-late rent check bounced which pisses me off to no end). Next she got a second weimaraner (high maintenance, expensive dog). She can't even afford the one she has, he is two years behind on shots and has a growth on his stomach that requires surgery. She can barely afford to feed him. She rations food so strictly that he is way too thin. THEN last week she bought a car. It's two years old, has $60,000 miles on it and she financed it for 6 years. (Bought at one of those shady dealerships that advertise they'll sell to anyone). The interest rate is way too high, AND she paid $4000 over the kelly blue book price because she didn't do ANY research, just decided she wanted it. PLUS she caused an accident two years ago, she couldn't afford PLPD on a 10-year-old car so her parents paid it, not sure how she thinks she'll pay full coverage for this. I think the dealership should be investigated for some sort of ethics violation for even selling it to her but whatever. They'll just sell the loan to someone else and still get their money. In 3 years when she totals this car or decides she doesn't want it anymore she's going to still owe like $13,000 on a car that will be worth about $2000 tops - if she actually takes care of it which, judging from her last car, she won't.         
  
When my husband and I got a couch last fall, we thought we'd do the financing just to build up some good credit. It got denied (paid cash so whatever). My husband got a credit report and, since his name and his dad's name are the same, his parents have a bunch of stuff in his name and they are always late and some stuff is in collections. The phone contracts just ended so he told them yesterday that they have to switch their numbers over because he's cancelling the service they put in his name. It's like $700 behind. He refuses to file a police report or anything because it's his parents but seriously, fuck that. They are kind, sweet, and generous but utterly retarded with money.   
  
Bonus point - my husband filed for an absentee ballot two years ago because we were going to be gone on voting day. The lady said they'd already processed it.

"c5ff4xp","&gt; Robbers just steal from you. Governments built hospitals, universities, schools, roads.

So if the robber did something good for the community with the money he robbed, that would justify the robbery?

&gt; Well tax isnt an issue in places like pakistan.


There is income tax now in pakistan. Most salaried persons have to pay.


&gt; And the rich do nothing about the poor. People starve. 

Pakistan has had independent government for 65 years. People still starve. 

&gt; While the top 1% live like gods. 

An engineer or doctor in Pakistan is in the top 1%. I can assure you that engineers and doctors don't live like gods in pakistan.

&gt; They could voluntarily use their vast wealth to make schools and hospitals, but they prefer mansions in London, Dubai and the US.

&gt; How do you feel about this?

You are talking about the super rich. They are perhaps 15,000 of those in Pakistan (.01%). I don't think they should be robbed any more than a poorer person. 


&gt; Some may say 'well they are not good muslims, they are going to hell'. That may be true, but what difference does it make to the poor? Do you think a crippled man with 4 kids worries if free education for his kids are paid for by taxes or a charity?

We don't know who is going to hell or heaven. We only know what God allows us to do and not do.

God does not allow muslims to rob people. There is no possibility that a robbing government will ever succeed. it will invariably fail.

The crippled man - and all others - should not depend on the government robbing people, to pay for their welfare. If you allow the government to rob people, then the incentive to charity disappears.  Everyone becomes worried about protecting their wealth so that the government does not rob them. The entire society becomes brutalized and act as brutes.

If on the other hand individual right to wealth is protected, then people are free to encourage each other to spend on the poor. That makes people civilized and caring for one another. It may not result in everyone being generous, but most people, even most rich people, are good. We can appeal to their good heartedness so that they share.

The post you are replying to **IS the post with travel time a.k.a. movespeed of Q in consideration.**  EDIT: Here's the math:

* Pre-patch R delay:  2.00 (Q travel time @ 1275 units over x distance) + 0.5 (GCD) + 0.4 (R cast time) = 2.9 sec
* Post-patch R delay:  2.12 (Q travel time @ 1200 units over x distance) + 0.15 (GCD) + 0.5 (R cast time) = 2.77 sec

"c53lbh6","Can't really give you a cite, but NeoPlatonist is correct; this is a field I've worked in and can explain.  The most common strategy involves trademarks.  Instead of keeping trademarks outright, US corporations will often create a subsidiary in a low- or zero-tax jurisdiction and then transfer the trademark over.  Two things happen as a result: 

1. The subsidiary will not pay a lot of tax on receipt of the mark, no matter how valuable, because of where it is based.  On the other hand, the US corporation can take an immediate tax loss because it has lost a valuable mark.  Of course, the US corp's stock in its subsidiary will increase in value, but unless it sells or liquidates the subsidiary, that increase is not taxed since it is ""unrealized"" income.

2. The US corp then pays its subsidiary a generous, but plausible, license fee to use the mark each year.  This payment is a further tax loss to the US corporation, and again incurs at most a low tax on the foreign subsidiary.

"c4xyln2","My wife is not a minimalist.  However, in the years we've been together, she's gotten A LOT better at moderating the amount of things we own.  I think minimalism is a pretty persuasive philosophy for the following reasons:

1.  Space.  Unless you're really rich, there is a maximum amount of space you can own.  My wife and I moved into a 900 sq ft apartment when we were first married.  Our wedding gifts (her family is very generous, but non-minimalist too) wouldn't fit into our apartment.  The practical reality made her have to think about it and the answer is obvious:  less stuff.

2.  Organization.  Most people (to varying degrees) hate a mess.  My wife used to spend about half an hour a day looking for her keys/phone/wallet etc in 12 different purses, looking for lost shoes, digging through drawers for the shirt she wanted, etc.  Eventually, she realized that having two purses, ridding herself of clothes she didn't wear, etc. was just easier and less stressful.  

3.  Money.  This one is obvious.  My wife had pretty limited experience in with a constrained budget before our marriage. But it didn't take long before the reality of spending, saving, budgeting, has helped her to understand that owning things affects your freedom.  She's a total budget hawk now and it's sexy.  

Anyway, it does take compromise sometimes.  Gently help her to realize some of the benefits of minimalism.  For example, my wife loves to bake and our kitchen cabinents were overflowing.  We had like 6 colanders.  One day while cleaning, I laid them all out on the counter and non-judgmentally asked what the different ones were for and which ones she used and which were the best.  She picked two.  I then asked if she would mind if donated the rest. It wasn't like a cross examination, I was just open and curious.  If she had said that she wanted them all, I would have been supportive. 

After seeing the state of our bathroom, I encouraged her to do some research online and we bought a REALLY nice salon quality curling iron so she can thrown the 3 cheap ones that she has away. Check out r/bifl (buy it for life). 

Try to avoid being preachy and let the ""doctrine"" of minimalism speak for itself.  It's a process.  Every day she gets a little better and I get a little more understanding.

Assuming the defendant  had a 1mbps upstream connection (generous, but typical for Comcast and the like) and each upload constituted $1 of sales lost (which is likely about an order of magnitude more than reality), she would've had to max out her upstream bandwidth for like 7.5 years straight just to upload enough data to equal the statutory minimum damages.

"c49w9tl","I was in a wild club up in NYC a couple years back. I don't know what I was doing there, a couple of weird friends convinced me to go on vacation there. Especially for an introvert like myself there are much better places to go on vacation, but one night made the whole trip worth it.

So this club had music so loud you could barely hear a person screaming next to you with people jumping around and doing kinky shit that I didn't even know existed. I was definitely very out of place there and began to question why I have the friends that I do. My only option seemed to be to sit quietly at the bar and drink my unreasonably overpriced drink and hope the rest of the world had a good time.

But then, I heard a loud banging sound, even louder than the music. Someone had brought a gun to the club and just shot down another patron! People started screaming and running around trampling each other to get away, but the gunman kept firing. There was no good exit I could get to from my position that would not be running straight past him.

Then, I don't know what happened. It was like I wasn't even controlling my body anymore; I did not know what I was doing! I ran straight at the gunman. He was distracted and did not even notice me until just a second too late. I jumped on top of him and grabbed his wrist. In the surprise he dropped his gun on the floor. It was likely out of ammo by this point anyways. I kept on top and repeatedly punched him in the face for I don't know how long. But I let up the pressure on his arms just a little and he escaped reached in and pulled out another gun. I swatted the pistol as hard as I could sending the barrel into a turn around as it fired. Straight through the assailant's head.

I sat on top of the now dead crazed gunman for a moment, now stunned. Then I felt a hand on my shoulder. I turned around to see who it was and saw one of the most beautiful women I have ever seen in my life. She had dark, smooth skin, long dark hair, big beautiful brown eyes, all the right curves, the works. ""Come on,"" she said with urgency in her voice, ""the police always want someone living to blame. You don't want to be around when they get here!""

Had I been in a more reasonable state of mind I might have objected, but things as they were, I complied and followed her out the door and escaped the crowd. She brought me back to her apartment, where I found she was not only generous but horny. She gave me everything that night, and neither of us held back as we had the best sex I've ever had in my life.

So, it was really a series of things which got me out of my shyness, but that definitely helped.

"c3pzfsu","Every year, millions of households provide huge quantities of supplementary food to wild birds. While alteration of the natural dynamics of food supply represents a major intervention in avian ecology, we have a remarkably limited understanding of the impacts of this widespread pastime. Here, we examine the many and varied responses of birds to supplementary feeding at backyard feeders – in large-scale management projects and in focused academic studies – and evaluate population responses to the bird-feeding phenomenon. Our review encompasses a wide range of species, from songbirds to raptors, and compares provisioning with a variety of foods, at different times of year and in different locations. *We consider positive impacts, such as aiding species conservation programs, and negative ones, such as increased risk of disease transmission. It seems highly likely that natural selection is being artificially perturbed, as feeding influences almost every aspect of bird ecology, including reproduction, behavior, demography, and distribution. As the effects of bird feeding cascade through ecosystems and interact with processes of environmental change, we suggest areas for future research and highlight the need for large-scale experiments, with a particular focus on the backyards of an increasingly urban and generous, but sometimes fickle, human population.*

""Food for thought: supplementary feeding as a driver of ecological change in avian populations"" by: Gillian N Robb, Robbie A McDonald, Dan E Chamberlain, and Stuart Bearhop. Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment. Volume 6, Issue 9. esajournals.org. 

According to this peer reviewed journal in the Ecological Society of America publication, feeders have mostly negative effects on the bird populations in certain areas. Although in some cases they may help with conservation, this is quite rare. Read more on the subject and you'll find that there is lots of room for experimentation, but the facts that are already known definitely suggest that they would indeed be detrimental to the ecosystem nearby, and even move up the food chain to cause more harm.

&gt;And yet, they have the freedom to do so! So why don't they? 

Because they have better opportunities, that's why.  

What you are saying, that those with fewer opportunities, have less freedom, is not true.  Not unless your opportunities are limited because other people are using violence against you.

When individuals are free, then because individuals have different wants, desire, talent, productivity, and family upbringing, then of course people are going to accumulate wealth at different rates, which enables some to have more opportunities than others.  This doesn't mean that others with fewer opportunities are being DEPRIVED of opportunities.  That Usain Bolt can run really fast, faster than myself, which enables him to have more opportunities to race and make money than myself, does not mean that he is in any way depriving me of opportunity.  He just has more than me in a relative sense.

If all it takes for you to consider slavery and lack of opportunity is to observe others making more money, and having more opportunities in life than you, is just you being unable to deal with your own shortcomings relative to their success.  You're being a little bitch.

&gt;Because they're fortunate enough that they don't have to enter and exploitative relationship in order to survive.

It's not exploitative for two people to voluntarily agree to a contract that pays a wage that you don't agree with.

&gt;&gt;""The minimum wage law prevents the poor and disenfranchised from competing on price. That's all it does.""

&gt;""Competing on price""????!!!!!!???!!!!???!!!!??? 

Did I fucking stutter a fourth time motherfucker?

&gt;You mean, it prevents capitalists from paying progressively lower and lower wages

No, I mean if people are able and willing to work for less than what you want to work for, then they should be free to deal with the employer you wanted to deal with, but he refused because he gets a better deal with the person who offered his labor for less.

&gt;because if anybody complains, there's another poor person willing to take their place. Yeah. Real fucking libertarian.

Yes, that is fucking libertarian, because it is peaceful and voluntary.  It's called freedom of competition.  It has resulted in around 95% of the working population making more than minimum wage, despite the fact that employers don't have to pay that much.  Supply and demand.  Not arbitrary whims of employers.  Do you know what socialists are socialists?  It's because they don't fucking understand basic economics.

&gt;&gt;""And then add to the mix you socialist freakshows who don't understand economics...""

&gt;OK, so...""Economists can tell us lots of things about taxes. 

Economists disagree when it comes to taxes.

&gt;They can tell you what will happen if you tax certain people at a certain rate. But they cannot answer the fundamental question: is it right to take away money from the rich to give to the poor?""

Economists can tell you that.  It's wrong.  Period.

&gt;So don't give me economic arguments here, but philosophical ones.

I can give you any arguments I want.

&gt;&gt;""If an individual voluntarily accepts a job that pays little wages, then obviously it must be because he finds gains to be made from it.""

&gt;Just because he gains doesn't mean he isn't being exploited. 

Just because he agrees to make less than what you think he should make, that doesn't mean he is being exploited.

&gt;Let's say I have no money. 

Let's say you are a burden on other people, OK.

&gt;The capitalist offers me a job: fifty cents an hour for work that's worth five dollars an hour. 

If he offers you $0.50 an hour, then your labor is worth $0.50 an hour, not $5.00 an hour.  If the labor required is worth $5.00 on the market, then he will offer $5.00, because you're not there to agree to $0.50.

If you're there to offer $0.50, and he accepts, then that job is now worth $5.00 an hour.  The price of labor is only ever manifested in actual trade.  That $5.00 is a number you brought down from magical land, out of your arse.

&gt;What a great deal! 

That's right!  The person who pays you $0.50 an hour just saved your fucking life.  You should thank him.  But no, you'll resent him for not sacrificing himself for your princessy, holer than thou, mine mine mine arse.  He should engage in charity with you if he knows what's good for him, that bastard.

He should have just pretended that he doesn't want any of your labor, so that he can avoid your wrath, just like you're not attacking your friends and family members for not helping you out.  No, your family and friends who aren't helping you, they're kind and generous.  But the one man who is paying you, who is saving your life, yeah, HE'S the asshole.  If he's the asshole, then he should not offer you anything, and then watch you die in the street like the social degenerate you are.  But you don't want him to behave like your family and friends now do you?  You NEED his money.  You WANT his money.  You have dollar signs in your eyes.  You know that your life was saved by him, so you resent him and guilt him into paying you even more, now that you found a source of money.

Who's the asshole again?

&gt;I win, because I'm no longer starving (I hope) and the capitalist wins, because he gets labor that he can exploit to gain even more capital (and hire more workers, and get more capital, and hire more workers...)

Oh my God, free trade is evil!  It saves lives!!!  Death to free trade!

&gt;&gt;""or fuck sakes, why is your mind stuck in the 19th century? Only around 5% of the US population today even makes minimum wage, whereas everyone else makes MORE than the minimum wage.""

&gt;Yeah! We can TOTALLY forget about that 5%! 

I didn't say to forget about them you retard.  I AM THE ONE WHO BROUGHT THEM UP.

If you want to help those 5%, then put your own fucking money up and help them.  Sell your PC, stop paying for an internet connection.  Stop buying that expensive food and start buying cheaper food.  Work harder, earn more money, and then give it all away to the poor.

What's that?  You're throwing up right now?  Feeling ill?  Yeah, that's because you don't want to help the poor.  You want OTHERS to help the poor, and you want to APPEAR in other people's eyes as moral and righteous for allegedly being all about the poor.  But you're not supportive of charity.  You support preventing the unemployed from getting jobs!  You'd rather have people make $0.00 an hour, than $0.01 less than the minimum wage.  That's how fucked up you are.

&gt;They don't matter much anyway! 

They do matter, for themselves.  But the 95% matter too.  They should not be chained down by violence just because their exists poor people.  Why should the poor exploit the rich?

&gt;Also, this is about minimum wage in general, and in principle.

Yet you just barfed all over that context, and claimed that I don't care about the poor.  I mean, is that your best response?  You are against the Patriot Act?  Well then you must not be a patriot!  Heathen!  You're about as enlightened as a piece of mouldy bread.

&gt;&gt;Boy, you seem to know a lot about what I believe.

"c1s10yq","1) Excellence is a habit.  It sounds kind of trite, but you get really, really good at the stuff you do a lot of.  

This can be good and bad; for example, I'm really really good at wasting time on the internet.   On the other hand, I also have a habit of exercising a bunch, which isn't such a big deal in your 20's, but once you reach your 30's, you start to be able to tell the difference between people who exercise and people who don't.   I guess what I'm trying to say is that if I were 22, I'd try to more consciously pick up the good habits (exercising and all that) and not spend so much time on the bad ones (spending so much time watching TV, or playing games on the internet -- I regret all the time I spent on stuff like WoW.)

Do the stuff you're afraid of.  If you're a bad public speaker, try to do more of it.  You'll practice it and get good at it, and you won't be afraid of it anymore.

2) Krishnamurti once wrote (paraphrasing) that conflict (in thoughts) comes from when you know what the right thing is, and you are doing another.  Knowing the right thing is easy, doing the right thing is difficult.  Try to do the right thing.  

3)  Friends are incredibly important.  I know people who were driven very far in their careers because they always wanted to show how much better than everybody else they were.  They pissed off a lot of people along the way.  They got the fancy title, but they're not very happy people now.  Sometimes I look back on my life and realize how incredibly fortunate I am that I've had my friends, because I could have been a very different person if I hadn't had them.  

4) Never lie to yourself -- recognize that you're a human being and that sometimes you will be kind and gracious and generous, but sometimes you will be petty and selfish and greedy.  People who cannot recognize the bad in themselves can't change it.  Your ego is the enemy, the thing that makes excuses to stop you from facing your weaknesses.  (""I could have beaten him, but I was really tired today ..."").  Recognize your weaknesses and practice them, so they won't be your weaknesses anymore.

"c1pdpsx","Ok, this is tough, because you can easily subvert your own actions with poisoned motivation. You can go out and try to be helpful and kind and generous, but that's all public and it's very much a part of changing the perception of others. These qualities make it ripe for your bad tendencies to subvert the actions, get upset that people don't recognize you've changed, and tweak your ""giving"" behavior for maximum effect.

These actions are also the easiest to come up with: soup kitchen volunteer, do the dishes for your house, buy everyone a card, work on your friend's campaign, etc. All of these are public actions that involve other people.

What you need to do is work out, emotionally. Think about if you wrote this post and said how weak you were, how you couldn't climb the stairs so you took the escalator and you never carried your books around because it hurts. You wouldn't immediately start with ""carry your damn books"" and ""use the damn stairs"". You would start with waking up everyday and doing an exercise routine, then changing your behavior throughout the day as you became stronger, and then finishing off the day with another workout and prepping for the morning so you don't fall of the horse.

This is what you need to do, emotionally. I'm going to basically describe your current Step 3, and tell you to make it Step Zero. This Step Zero is to be repeated each day, not just once. It is the foundation for all other steps, each day.

It starts whenever you want it to. Step one is close your eyes and smile. Seriously, don't smile while looking at anyone. This isn't for anyone to see. This if for you to feel. That's step one. Everything flows from this.

In private, in your room, begin a habit of writing. It doesn't matter exactly the format, but the content should be people you know. You can make a list of them and then next to each one write a pleasant message to them. You can put one person per page and just write about the good times you've had with them and all the positive things they've done for you. You can write about the suffering and challenges they've been through. All of it is valid. But a habit of allowing your relationships to develop in private must be cultivated. You have so much information about these people, you need to process it properly.

In doing this, you will begin to go about your day and really appreciate those people you come in contact with. You'll change your core, from which all actions spring, just like working out. The help you provide will be genuine and not pandering. And if your help is looked upon with derision or mistrust, you will be able to bear it and get through it without losing your way, because you will know just how important these people are, and how much they deserve it.

You will start to recognize that you don't have all the information about someone. You will become genuinely intrigued by some of them and that interest will show during conversations and they'll feel it. You will start to see that some people are toxic for you and bring out the worst in you and you will be able to defend yourself against their influence. You will be able to anticipate the desires of others and become truly thoughtful. And when people are down, you will be equipped to support them from a position of strength, by getting under them and propping them up, instead of grabbing them by the collar and trying to drag them upright.

If you want to change the world, first change yourself. If you want to change yourself, first change your actions. If you want to change your actions, first change your mind. If you want to change your mind, first change your heart.

Good luck and stick with it.",1302791872,"you can go out and try to be helpful and kind and generous, but that's all public and it's very much a part of changing the perception of others.","kind and generous","generous",NA,FALSE,"kind and generous","kind",NA,NA,0

"c1hktbo","I don't believe that notion one bit and I was born into poverty.

Wealth disparity isn't the reason for chasm that exists between the upper and the lower, it's personal life decisions.

There are more poor people than rich that is a fact. I believe it's also a fact that there are more people in the world who do not strive to be more than themselves.

I believe the majority of poor people buy into cultural omnipresent beliefs, whether that be paying for a spiritual guru to come and rid your community of bad spirits in India using all the money your group can save for a year....

...or having kids with your girlfriend you met in highschool and starting a family in small town America.

These are poor choices. Choices made by the poor that keep them poor. And at the end of the day regardless of the pressure that society places on each of us that these choices are the right choices....they're still ours to make.

Not all have a fair shake, some are born into an unfair situation, these are truly poor people. And to this end it's imperitive that the wealthy always remain objective and generous.

But I won't abide by the notion that there is unfairness about the distribution of wealth just because there are poor people and more of them then rich.

But I don't agree that only rich people create jobs or that they spend the most money. 

1. If you have a generous but FAIR/HONEST welfare system, this can potentially help the downtrodden get back up on their feet, go back to school/better their life instead of slave away for the rest of their life at the bottom. The problem is created when people go on welfare for their entire life and never contribute to society. We should work on fixing welfare.

2. A ton of rich people hoard money and buy useless luxury items. My grandpa (very rich, ran his own company.. exactly like ur grandpa) spent money on jewelry for his second wife, and spent all his money on books that he never read. His house is filled with unopened, giant books. Is this helping spur economic activity in the long run? Are those books going to do anything? When poor people spend money, they help local economies and the money goes back in the system. 

3. Taxing a person who makes millions a year at a higher rate (a few % points) is not going to affect them in any way. The difference between giving the government 100k more is nothing.

"c1c9dc9","This may answer some of your question

&gt;**How will we keep costs down if everyone has access to comprehensive health care?**


&gt;People will seek care earlier when chronic diseases such as hypertension and diabetes are more treatable. We know that both the uninsured and many of those with skimpy private coverage delay care because they are afraid of health care bills. This will be eliminated under such a system. Undoubtedly the costs of taking care of the medical needs of people who are currently skimping on care will cost more money in the short run. However, all of these new costs to cover the uninsured and improve coverage for the insured will be fully offset by administrative savings.

&gt;In the long run, the best way to control costs is to improve health planning to assure appropriate investments in expensive, high-tech care, to negotiate fees and budgets with doctors, hospital and drug companies, and to set and enforce a generous but finite overall budget.

They may be disappointed. They may not understand. They may worry for your well-being.

You are now the ""black sheep"" of your family. This is a simple fact that you must accept and claim as your own mantle. This also means you are a source for a kind of truth and insight that is unavailable to them; if they seek it from you or you see an opportunity to provide it, be generous but modest.

There is a reason that the tribal shamans often live on the outskirts of their village in a shelter of their own design. They cannot live in the ways of the majority anymore; they see its shortcomings, its narrow-minded idiocies and banalities, vast room for improvement undreamt of in the consensus mind, yet they realize flouting those established ways and experimenting with new ones in the midst of the common villagers would only sow discontent and resentment.  The shaman sets up shop a little ways away, just out of view, far enough not to disrupt the harmony of their daily routine, but close enough that they can still come to him for fresh wisdom when needed.

The right-hand path is the established way of one's culture, the way ""everybody"" does things ""the way it has always been done"" (which is often no older than one's own grandparents, since few have met anybody older than their grandparents who could tell of a way when things were done differently). The left-hand path is what the shaman experiments with when the others aren't watching; in this secret practice, the shaman tests, discovers and perfects new methods that work better than the established ways, which he can slowly, gently, and benevolently introduce into the right hand path that everyone else follows, as they come to him with problems that their familiar ways have created or cannot solve.

I was a late bloomer though so I didn't grow up with that sense of entitlement that never bodes well. I'm past the bloom of youth now I've found age has some  advantages. One  is knowledge and perspective.  Another surprising benefit is anonymity. I know a lot of women hate when this happens but I rather like it.  It's like an invisibility cloak.

1. I knew males were interested and I knew why. I could afford to be choosy (and fickle at times) but I didn't always choose well.

It took me a while to grasp the notion that looks may attract more guys, but it doesn't make them stick around.

How much cotton candy can you stomach before you want something else?

2. I never acted conceited or egotistical. In fact I had an inferiority complex so women didn't hate me. I never competed for guys, I never acted self important and I never bragged.

Your error is understandable. After all, thanks to our tribal background we're hardwired to think in terms of leader figures. Never does it occur to us that we could have a process, a system, in stead of an individual leader.

We constantly place our trust in non-democratic systems, in which specialists are key elements. Yet our political process is a jumble of fallacies and manipulation just because we're too afraid to see our own limitations.

&gt;Where on earth did you get the idea that everyone agrees with the majority? Majoritarianism is a known danger in democratic systems. History is littered with demagogues who ruled through inflaming the mob. Many of them went on to be garden-variety tyrants, too.

I agree. The concept of a majority being more right than a minority (the backbone of the democratic concept) is extremely flawed and even detrimental for our progress.

&gt;Did I? I don't recall assuming any such thing. I'm talking about the dangers of dictatorship, no matter how well intentioned. Personally I reckon I would be a most excellent dictator; wise, educated, compassionate, judicious and generous. But it would not be me. It is almost certain that a psychopath would sooner or later take that throne. No bloody thankyou.

I agree that an old-fashioned dictatorial system is not desirable. However, a democracy is even worse.

&gt;I don't trust civil servants either. I'm talking directly about the ancient hope for an enlightened tyrant.

&gt;If you want to discuss the weaknesses of democracy, bureacratism, technocracy et al then we can talk about those. But the weakness of other systems is not an advantage of dictatorship. So straw-manning the hell out of democracy is not the way to prosecute your case.

The only way to judge the desirability of a governmental process is to compare it to its alternatives.

&gt;No, what they have is the avenue to exhaust their lust for power through peaceful means. This is the genius at the core of democratic politics: it changes government through ballots, not bullets. It lets power-hungry maniacs beat on each other with the minimum possible harm to everyone else. There's still harm - a lot of harm - but compared to civil war it's a doddle.

The genius of the democratic process is that it allows for a powerful elite to reign with total legitimacy.

In no way shape or form do the elected upper class (those few with the means to get elected) represent the people.

In a theoretical system where the governmental process HAS to choose the best options the government derives legitimacy from being right, whereas in a democracy the ruling elite derive legitimacy from being popular.

&gt;Such as?

There are certain interpretations of technocracies/meritocracies which could serve to get rid of the hurdle of succession (and many other issues) and prove to be much superior to democracy.",1274014527,"personally i reckon i would be a most excellent dictator; wise, educated, compassionate, judicious and generous.","judicious and generous","generous",NA,FALSE,"judicious and generous","judicious",NA,NA,0
"c0q43or","&gt; It's also too much to grasp for individual voters. The limitations put on dictators are the same limitations faced by voters. Therefore what is even superior to dictators is a governmental process involving many people and specialists with dictatorial power, but with checks and balances.

The ultimate logical end of such a system is the devolution of power to individuals; ie, the antithesis of dictatorial absolutism. Which is it to be?

&gt; 2: In democracies it is assumed everyone will agree with the majority. That seems to be running, now doesn't it? It's a matter of having a comfortable populace with a lot to lose and legitimacy on the part of the ruling process.

Where on earth did you get the idea that everyone agrees with the majority? Majoritarianism is a known danger in democratic systems. History is littered with demagogues who ruled through inflaming the mob. Many of them went on to be garden-variety tyrants, too.

Again, the ultimate question is not: ""Here is centralised power, who shall have it?"", but rather, ""How much power should the centre have?""

&gt; Besides, in a democracy you assume the individual voter won't abuse their power.... That's even more naive.

Did I? I don't recall assuming any such thing. I'm talking about the dangers of dictatorship, no matter how well intentioned. Personally I reckon I would be a most excellent dictator; wise, educated, compassionate, judicious and generous. But *it would not be me*.

&gt; 5: The system of elected officials has total power. Will anyone else try to seize that power? No, they usually don't. The same checks and balances can be applied to dictatorial systems.

No, what they have is the avenue to exhaust their lust for power through peaceful means. This is the genius at the core of democratic politics: it changes government through ballots, not bullets.

Years ago, when Mike Tyson fought some hapless moron on pay-per-view, I went to a theatre party in NYC to watch it.  It was being thrown by a chorus person in a Broadway show that happened to be starring Sarah Jessica Parker.  She and Matthew Broderick happened to show up to the party and we sat next to each other on the floor.  We hurled snarky comments at the screen together for the ten minutes that we were seated (Tyson dispatched the guy in a minute and a half).  Very funny people, I thought.

As for the other people I've met, it depends on what you consider fame.  To me, some of them were very important.

Robyn Hitchcock--twice.  Talked with him and the Egyptians after a show in '93.  Bantered with him about what make of cheese grater he was playing on a song called ""Wafflehead"".  And then, when the Soft Boys reunited, I ran into him on a side street near Irving Plaza in NYC.  I told him to have a good show, and he said he'd try.

I met Luna (the band).  They came into my diner, too.  Dean Wareham claimed he had heard of my band at the time, which was sweet and generous but not bloody likely, as we'd only played one show at the time.

Gary Oldman, again, in my diner.  Very nice.  Ordered an omelette, laughed at my jokes.  That's all I ask for in a customer.

I went onstage with Ricky Jay once, as an audience volunteer.  Does that count?  I got some laughs when he asked me what was in my pockets.  I was sick that week, so I said, ""Snotrags.""

Kristin Hersh of Throwing Muses and I talked guitar sounds.  She really lit up.  I think everyone else that had been waiting in line for her at the record store just smeared adulation on her or something, so a conversation about actually making music was welcome.

"c0bs47k","The distinction is very simple and is based on the non-aggression principle.

The word ""entitlement"" hides two very distinct situations in this case.  In the case of property, entitlement means ""you may passively keep"".  In the other cases that you quote, entitlement means ""others must actively give you"".  As you can see, using the word ""entitlement"" is cause for much equivocation.  Let me explain in more detail:

What does it mean to be entitled to your property?  It means that everybody else ought to refrain from taking it -- including your body, because undoubtedly you own it -- without your consent.  Remember, *you already have* your body and your property.  In other words, nobody need go out of their way for you to keep your property.  As you can see, non-aggression and property are, in fact, logically congruent principles.

What does it mean to be entitled to education, roads and health care?  Unlike in the first case, these entitlements mean that someone actually has to go out of his way to do this for you -- otherwise your entitlement is as empty as the claim that you have a grandmother, but she's dead.

OK.  Now, some people are generous, but most aren't -- and why should they be anyway?  So, how do you get those selfish people to go out of their way and get you your pet entitlements?  Turns out the only practical way to do this is through aggression:

* either by forcibly taking money from people through threats of violence (and aggressing against those who won't yield, even if they are peaceful), or
* by forcibly making people perform these services for free at gunpoint / with brainwashing, or
* a mixture of both.

As you can see, in practical terms, entitlements in your list of pet services require violence, threats or manipulation to be inflicted on peaceful people.  So non-aggression and these entitlements you listed are, in fact, logically incompatible.  Logic dictates that one of them must be wrong -- there is just no way around that.

Of course, if you believe that violence is legitimate against peaceful people, you may be inclined to dismiss my reasoning -- but the vast majority of humans that you know, including you, would beg to differ.  And how do you know that?  By observation: you and your acquaintances don't go around punching people like animals or making up arbitrary rules and then threatening people with punishment to get what you all want.

Or you can just look at your country.  There's violence -- well-disguised -- everywhere.  The implicit threat of a cage or poverty if you don't pay the tax man.  The same threat if you don't ask for permission before doing almost anything -- today, you need to ask for permission (they call it ""license"", and if you don't have one, can of whoopass for you) for *practically everything*.  So, to maintain our sanity, we pretend it ""isn't true"" or ""isn't so bad"", and lash out at whomever points out at the emperor's nudity.  All the while the rulers live like kings with our money, enjoy their immunity, abuse their power, kill people domestically (""law enforcement"") and abroad (""war"").  And what about those ""noble entitlements""?  ""Here's a few potholes and factoid rote-memorization institutes for you"".  Oops, looks like institutionalized violence didn't exactly get us the world we wanted!

-----------------------------------------

Now, you may object to this and say ""But hey, what about a robber?  Doesn't stopping him require violence?"".  Yes, in the majority of cases, you need force -- but this force that you would use to stop a robber would be in defense -- either of self, or of property --  and is therefore legitimate, according to the non-aggression principle.  Surely you don't contest that you may defend yourself against an aggressor, right?

"c066ekx","&gt; Yes. Since I generally earn a lot more than my friends, nine times out of ten I pick up the check. When I'm out with coworkers that earn on the same order as I do, we either split or rotate picking up the tab.

My bad, I didn't state the question properly. What you do is called private charity. You voluntarily use your money to help those less fortunate. And the fact that you do it voluntarily should make you less cynical about assuming that you have to force others to be charitable for the good of society.

Forced charity is not a moral virtue. And it's even uglier if the implication behind it (and I'm not accusing you of this) is ""I'm being generous, so everyone else should too."" Because really what that means is the person saying that is not acting in the spirit of selflessness that is at the core of what it means to be charitable and generous.

But, the question should have read: ""When you go out to dinner, would you be offended if your friends suggested that you have an obligation to pay for them since you make more money?""

I trust you'll answer ""yes"" to that...

&gt; I just think that someone who nets six figures after taxes shouldn't be whining that someone who makes $20,000 a year needs to pay ""their fair share""

Who are these people who are complaining about that? I even said in my post, that it's reasonable for those with very low incomes to be relieved of their tax burdens by the rest of the taxpayers. And if you're arguing against Joe the Plumber, his complaint wasn't that the guy making $20,000 wasn't paying enough, it was that he was paying more than the people making $60,000 or $100,000. Which goes back to my previous post about whether there is anything fair about slapping a fixed tax percentage on people's incomes.

&gt; This is not about equity. This is not about what is ""fair."" This is about doing what's right. It is NOT right for someone earning minimum wage and barely getting by to pick up their ""fair share"" of federal obligations.

You are making an ends-justify-the-means argument. I agree with you, it's not ""right"" for someone making $12,000 to pay $1,000 in taxes. So that means that the $1,000 we want to relieve them of paying must either translate into a federal budget cut, or into higher taxes for the rest of us. My argument is, is it ""right"" to shift the $1,000 to the wealthiest 5%, or would the right thing to do be to shift it evenly to both the wealthiest 5% and the other 95% in the middle class who are still paying taxes?

My argument is that people like you are essentially saying ""this is not right that these poor people are paying such taxes. Therefore, we (the majority) will stick the rich people with the bill."" Again, you act as if the only option is for the rich to pay. If it's not, then the question must be asked why the hardship should be shouldered by the rich, just because they ""shouldn't be whining about how much money they make."" Even though they are likely wealthier precisely because they provide more jobs and goods/services to society than the middle class do.

It's important to resolve this question about whether it's right to take from the rich. Obama repeatedly talks about tax cuts for 95%. If there's an argument to be made that that is what's equitable, then lets pursue that. But otherwise, this is essentially a populous ploy, the majority oppressing the minority.
