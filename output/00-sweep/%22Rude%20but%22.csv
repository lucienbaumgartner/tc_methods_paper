You just used the rules point to hide behind it so it would make you look like you did not violate my rights for free  speech at all because its not about what i wrote but about rules but rules say that you cant state opinion different than what is accepted to be true . This rule is also hiding behind attack on emotion and victimization of these proffesionals calling such people who speak their opinions , unethical , what is supposed to create outrage from other people against violator . 

\- Well they can't read it because it's been removed for breaking the rules. 

This is enforced control and censuring the information . 

\- Asking all users to follow the rules doesn't prevent ideas ""from all sides"" to be presented, why would you think that? 

You can re-read what i wrote in the lies and deception part. It does . Thats why i would think that . You answered by asking me ? What kind of answer is that ? Avoidant . 

 

\- So you're saying that if a knitting community deleted your comment that simply included a link to porn, you'd similarly be arguing that they shouldn't violate your free speech and they should allow people to critically analyze it?

&amp;#x200B;

Well , i see no reason to post such a thing into knitting community but if i posted photo of car or phone it would be less outrageous or it would be ignored at all . What i wanted to point at was that people act like they are ashamed of human body while they crave for sex because its all over the inernet . Last sentence did not belong to part where i stated my opinion about porn but i admit that i did not write it correctly because i wanted to adress the porn part amidst my thoughts about true core of the problem . 

... thus creating half truth by manipulating field of view and deceiving people . What is wrong about porn and human body and act of reproduction ? Do you cover your eyes when going to shower ? These rules you talk about are not to protect but to narrow the view and enforce control . 

Last sentence shouldve been before the porn part so i created confusion which gave you great position to attack me but its all right . 

\- In other words, you think your opinions should trump everyone else's in the community and you shouldn't have to follow the rules. 

You yet again cover behind the rules which basically defy free speech as i stated before . I have right to state my opinion and rules forced you to intervene because of the content of my answers what i proved already .

\- I'm not being rude here but I assume you have a few personal issues. If you have medication please make sure you're following the dosages that have been recommended by a professional, you need to look after yourself. 

Im not being rude but whole time iam ridiculing you and hiding behind rules (which basically says what you should or should not say otherwise you are unethical and you will be ridiculed)  yet again leaving no real counstructive answer or counter evidence . Heres one last ridicule to nail you into ridicule/ rule coffin : you should take your medication . 

&amp;#x200B;

Not only your rules defy free speech , you are enforcer of control and policeman of this illusionary freedom which is in truth controlled environment or should i say in lie ? Lies and deception everywhere protected by rules . Also iam not taking any kind of medication because i know that all  diseases have core in mind and body reflects mind . Iam healthy because i think so and thats what you call placebo effect and cant really explain and call it phenomena or whatever and its just another proof that materialistic world is under heavy influence of mind thus absolutely annihilating all the raional ridiculing points made by guy before . This mightve worked on someone who dont think but i do and iam proud of it . I will not bow because you want to force me to do so . This people is price for true freedom. Ridiculing as you couldve see , violent opposition and what is next ? I cant do otherwise than repeat quote of Arthur Schopenhauer.

 

All truth passes through three stages. First, it is ridiculed. Second, it is violently opposed. Third, it is accepted as being self-evident.

That's not meant to be rude but IMO ANYONE who is allowed to get away with saying such uncomfortable, uneccassary, unbecoming, unconscious, unintelligent, disrespectful and ignorant words to their family is undeserving of being treated with passiveness. In my own experience ive had to call my parents out on multiple occasions and we're not really on speaking terms right now. 

It's not how I would want things to be, but I decided that they need to know if I didn't ask for their opinions I don't want to hear them, and if I wouldn't choose to have other people in my life who asked such questions constantly and berated me with their spiritual opinions there is no reason to make an exception for them, even if they are blood. People need to be reminded what family really is. .

I'm all for discussion and debate when done respectfully and healthily, but it must come from a mutual desire and longing to UNDERSTAND, not to just be right. I'll be the first to admit religion is not the only reason I don't respect or care for my pants the most so seeking to maintain that relationship it's not high on my priority list, but I personally believe blood in no way gives them a pass to be an asset...

There is a bit of a back story to this. So originally I placed an order a few months ago on Uber Eats, when the delivery guy got here I was brushing my teeth and didn’t immediately here the door bell. He might’ve waited a max of 5 minutes. When I got to the door he was not only rude but extremely threatening. He questioned me aggressively “What took you so long you know I’m waiting?” It was hostile and actually odd. Never been in a situation where I thought an employee was a danger or something. I then made the comment “Hey man, sorry I kept you waiting I’ll throw in a couple extra bucks” genuinely trying to be nice. He proceeds to make me uncomfortable. I can’t really describe the situation but it wasn’t just him being mad about waiting, he actually felt like a loose canon and he might hit me or something. He then leaves, but instead of tipping him I said screw that, left him nothing and went on about my life. 

A few months goes by and that brings me to today, I made an order on Uber Eats and what do you know he is my driver. The last time I saw him made me so uncomfortable I almost canceled it, but he was to close and decided not to. He gets to the door and I know he remembers me but a split second before I opened it I thought I’d be polite. I said “Thank you sir.” He sort of just shoves it in my hands and doesn’t say a word. 

I contacted Uber and asked them to blacklist him from coming to my house. Never asked for a refund or anything like. Just want to be able to order food without that turd coming here again. Oh well. 

So AITA

tl;dr Uber Eats driver was a dick, contacted support and pretty sure he doesn’t work there anymore

During some of my worst depression/anxiety episodes, I would sometimes just cancel my plans with an hours notice because I couldn't stop shaking at the thought of leaving the house or I was too physically exhausted to make it to the shower to clean myself.

"e4114w6","I've been in all of the Pools. F-pool. D-pool. C-pool and Normal pool. There are no intentional feeders in Normal pool [Except in the shallow end of the normal pool, 6k behavior score, where people just got out from C-pool but will go back down the next conduct summary]. So if you meet a lot of intentional feeders, either is your behavior score really low, or you are playing at a bracket I don't know anything about. My experience just covers 3-6k, idk about the other brackets.

Now if you are in the ""hidden pool"" without being an intentional feeder yourself, either you are very toxic or you are an extremely bad player. If you were both good and nice, you'd get loads of commends and get to play in the normal pool. If you are rude but good, you get reported as much as you get commended. In the end you go downwwards behavior-score wise as reports weight more than commends. Same with if you are nice but bad. You might not think being bad is a reason to report someone, but the very people you report for being toxic probably reports you for being bad. In the end you both trade and go down to the same behavior-score bracket.

Where am I going with this? Well, in the lower MMr brackets [NOT behavior score, these two are separate!] you have people like SGTSizzles ruining for shit and giggles. But in higher MMr, people don't ruin for no reason. You might think they do, but if you take a second to think about it, did you do something like stealing their lane by 1st picking / not rolling? Or did you play really bad? Like picking slark vs necro and die 0-10? Not intentionally, but still die? Don't be surprised if you are flamed [for being bad], reported [for being bad] and have teammates saying ""GG end"" in all chat as they run down mid. In their brains, the game is over because you are nothing but luggage. In normal pool, you have people playing anyway no matter how bad you personally perform. In fact, in normal pool they have a ""Never Give Up!"" kind of mindset. This isn't the case in C-d-F. The first 10 min determines the game and after wards the losing team gives up. So for you to meet intentional feeders, you must be playing in a lower behavior score pool with people whom you are constantly triggering. Like, they are there for a reason. They probably hate noobs / acc buyers (rightfully or not, they accuse everybody of everything) and as soon as someone makes even the smallest of mistakes, it adds fuel to the fire. No problem in normal bracket, but in C-D-F it definitely is. You might report them. But be damn sure they report you back. And as time goes on, your environment will get more and more intoxicated. 

You are basically in prison, hanging with a bunch of thugs, and then complain on reddit how these thugs behave in prison. They are there for a reason. They have their own culture.

I know what you mean regarding other customer service jobs... restaurants, even supermarkets... so here is my opinion.

Bus drivers (at least in Scotland) have to deal with:

Junkies/people smacked out their face in the day time. Being aggresive. Restaurant workers don't get that as much. Supermarkets may... but then there are several managers and workers to help de-escalate. As well as a direct link to the police. Bus drivers are alone.

Timed breaks. If your bus driver stops at a depot at 1.30 for lunch, and is back on at 2.00 on another bus... it is frustrating if they have to deal with people dilly dallying around, or being rude. If they get to the depot at 1.40, then they may still have to get on next bus at 2.00

Traffic laws. People treat buses like taxis. Stop here. Let me off here. Hurry up. (Again... i have heard it all). Bus drivers cant break the law or they risk losing licence and job.

"dxhv3ji","Power imbalance has social consequences, but is irrelevant to this discussion since the whole argument is based on a moral equivalency. 

You simply can't take the stance that a woman should avoid men on the street because men assault women while also saying that it's racist for a white person to avoid a black person on the street. That, in itself, is pure hypocrisy. 

With the message of self preservation being mixed, i'm not contributing to that, and i'm not necessarily fussed either way. You're in control of yourself, your movement and, generally, your safety. Obviously that can change if someone is maliciously attempting to cause harm, which ties into your argument about not knowing which men are the ""bad ones"", but that logic also applies perfectly to not knowing which black people are the ""bad ones"" and avoiding them on the street as well. Do you not see the comparison? 

To be clear i'm not telling women anything. I'm just pointing out that it's clearly very hypocritical to be fine with avoiding men, since they can assault you, but not being fine with avoiding black men as a white man, since that's racist. Even though the crimes committed between whites and blacks heavily err on the side of black culprits (just like crimes between men and women err heavily on the side of male culprits). It's the same thing. 

I'm not attempting to be rude, but many of the points made against my argument just aren't even relevant to it. So I feel fine dismissing them. 

""Sealioning"" is a new term to me. Had to google that. Good way to try to discredit me, but if you aren't engaging and you're mentioning irrelevant points, i'm going to stick to my argument. I don't have to go off track to irrelevant points and go on tangents every other comment. The main thrust of my argument hasn't been discredited in the slightest and I think you're getting desperate with this namecalling. 

You're quite correct that i'm not going to change my mind listening to you, not until you've made a salient point. You're basically arguing against things I didn't say half the time. 

Then to close that off you say ""I so hope you can come to a place of understanding without the pain of experience"" - i've been mugged by black men 3 times in my life, never once by a white person. I could say the exact same back to you. Why would it be racist of me to be weary of black men at night on the street? Prior experience paints a different picture, and that's the *exact* argument you'd make, and are essentially making, about men.

"dv4uktc","I had pretty bad experiences quite honestly and I think it kinda triggered a self hate phase. I was told I was ""funny looking"" or ""ugly"" when I was a wee child by them because I didn't and never have had a typical Asian/Chinese face I guess. When I was in my teens, they would act with this air of superiority around Asian Americans and basically saw us as ""fake Chinese"" and kept to themselves. College, they would stick to themselves, if they let an outsider in, it was a white guy and they'd rather speak broken english than having a Chinese person who can speak both english and mando/canto. Yup. guess we are both fake Chinese and fake American too. One thing I'll never accept as ""just culture"" is how rude some of the FOBS were and continue to be. I was not taught to be loud,obnoxious, and disrespectful with no empathy for others by my family yet I encounter behavior that falls into this category way too often. I see their behavior take a turn for the worse when dealing with me as well, all smiles disappear, and they just want me out. I honestly don't know if this is because I'm AA or because I don't look Chinese to them and they think I'm Japanese or something.


Honestly, I wonder why I'm not more self hating if these are the people that represent the home country. The only thing keeping me from going that route is I know my family taught me better, and I find it odd that there doesn't seem to be more who did the same. They've tried to explain to me that it's a lot of ""country bumpkins"" and they are dumb and rude, but they are from the country too.

"dr15cky","OMG, this was very similar to a situation that has caused me a lifetime of anxiety around little people. When I was a very small child we had a woman that had been in school with my mother that suffered from birth defects caused by a medication called thalidomide that was given to women for morning sickness. It caused truncated limbs and other massive birth defects.
     I grew up in a very small town where we would see the same people regularly at the only grocery store in town. Apparently the first time this woman approached my mother to “catch up” with her I had said something along the lines of “what’s wrong with you?” or such. Very rude, but perfectly natural for a child and perfectly reasonable (at least I feel). Afterwards my mother tried to explain to me about birth defects and small people, mind you it was the early 80’s, and PC terms were not that common.
     Apparently the next time she saw my mother and came to speak I must have gotten excited bc I said something along the lines of, “I know your ok now, you were just born a midget!” Which is of course not the truth of the situation but the way my childhood mind understood her looking different and I guess I wanted to let her know I understood. 
     The woman was never angry or upset with either me or my mother. But from then on when my mother would see her coming to talk to us she would become very nervous and tell me things like, “don’t say anything, don’t stare at her, don’t ....”. I would become nervous thinking I was going to do something “wrong” and I think my mother would become nervous for the same reason and also seeing her child try not to be nervous. It was a vicious cycle and lasts to this day bc when I see little people my anxiety skyrockets and I try not to look at all or act calm (which I’m totally not) so then when I do look I feel that I “look” like I’m staring and the cycle starts over all again.

I don't mean to be overly rude, but really dude, did you just hear the term ""bridge an amplifier"" somewhere and assume it's some super secret technique with special powers or something?  I only say this because I hear this term being used more often and very out-of-context. 

To save you the time of looking it up... ""bridging"" an amplifier, means to combine channels. You use the speaker itself to join 2 separate channels.  Its like captain planet except you can only combine 2 channels at a time. 

And to answer your question... NO... A subwoofer receives very very very very strong LOW-pitched signals.  A tweeter receives very weak High-pitched signals.     Think of it this way... a subwoofer is like hitting a rug hanging from a clothes line with a baseball bat... Harder hits produce lower notes in this scenario.  A Tweeter is like tapping a glass window with a spoon.   If you try to flip the roles around, Hitting a rug with a small spoon, or hitting a glass window with a baseball bat... you either produce NOTHING or you break your noise-maker... 

So, hook a tweeter up to an amp designed to put out sub-woofer bass... you WILL destroy your tweeters.   

To improve the performance of your interior speakers, you need to add ANOTHER amplifier in the mix, you need to also rewire your current speakers to go to the new amp you purchase. This is not an easy feat. 

But if it's important that bass performance match your interior speaker performance without spending much money, then you could just turn your bass-amplifier down. 

Good Luck.

"dahll4e","Thank you! That's very kind. I have considered moving out of London for a variety of reasons, but I'd end up going somewhere north I think. Wouldn't leave the UK.

I first came to London as a wide-eyed 15-year-old craving a 'cooler' place to live than my little coastal town, and I fell in love with the fast pace, the cultural offerings, the architecture.. And these are things I genuinely and thoroughly still love about London, along with the people. I know many consider Londoners to be rude and awful but I've found people to be warm, interesting, welcoming, intelligent, funny. I like the melting pot aspect of this city as well. 

In contrast, Swedes are very cold, reserved and like to keep to themselves and their established friendship groups. Often, they've all grown up together and are suspicious of new people trying to enter the circle. I realised this when I moved back home for a few months during my third year at uni. I had a very hard time meeting people and reconnecting with old friends and acquaintances and their friends were... not outright rude but not very friendly, and not very interested in getting to know me whatsoever. Conversation was forced. I'm a very chatty person who loves asking questions (trained journalist and natural busybody), and I just wouldn't get anything in return. Now, if you speak English and you come from another country (especially US, Canada, Australia or UK), you'll get the royal treatment. People LOVE English speaking people because it's a novelty and exotic and they get to practice their English. You'd see a very different side of things, which is why a lot of people don't believe me when I tell them. Now, naturally, there are tons of really friendly Swedes who are awesome to get to know but they don't seem to be from where I'm from! I much prefer the English, but perhaps it's the same thing there - they're nice to me because I'm foreign and it's more interesting to talk to me than some bird who grew up in Clapham. I don't know.

As for the country itself, that's what I'm missing the most. WOODLANDS. I go to Hampstead Heath as often as I can for that reason. I also miss the sea a lot. I'm going back home soon for a weekend and can't wait to go into the woods and just be. London's way too hectic for me these days and WAY TOO MANY PEOPLE. 

As for whether or not people are happier - I don't know. People are obsessed with status. My mother told me a few years ago that they were having problems in my home town with teenagers selling sex so they could buy luxury items and keep the whole 'Instagram lifestyle' going, and I don't doubt it for a second.

It was more like, every once and awhile the frustration of cohabitation would rear up and present itself in that way. My mom was also passive.

My father in law got a new truck a few years ago. At the time they were living in a large apartment complex. He literally had to walk across the entire parking lot because he was paranoid someone would hit the truck or scratch it and refused to park near other vehicles. Because nothing takes the shine of off a new vehicle like that first scratch. 

Point is, people get attached to material things, especially material things they've worked hard for. However it's a fools errand because houses get lived in and trucks get driven.

To me it sounds like he's marking his territory and demanding respect over something he really values. But it's silly because it's a bathroom. Of course it should be kept clean and hygienic because people wash their dirty bodies and take craps in there. But it's not worth it to alienate your family over material things.

The only thing that ever changed my dad was that my sister moved out on her own after high school, soon after my parents divorced, and then I eventually moved out. So now when he looks around at a messy house ... it's his mess. 

Is there a way that you could let your dad be the only person that uses that bathroom? Is it the only bathroom? If he wants to control it that bad let him be the sole user. 

If he's alienating everyone it's irrational. If he's just being annoying it's rude but normal considering the bathroom is brand new. Doesn't make it right though! It's a space that will be used. He should have been cognisant of that from day one of the project.

"d840u4a","It's a great letter, and the writer has a strong voice. I hope he/she continues to be an advocate for other children in the system.

The type of people she describes have no business raising any children, let alone hurt ones. 

Personally, I found my foster parent training to be a joke. What I draw on daily is my training as a special needs teacher. Patience, positivity, creativity, understanding and love is what makes a good parent. I know we all have our bad days, but just going to the grocery store these days can be a horror show. Last night I saw a kid say something like ""I ate this at daycare. It was good!"" and the parent snatched the box from her hands, and hissed at her that she's ""always freaking grabbing things at the store and if you don't make the money, stop asking for crap!""

She was like four years old. I don't claim to have the answer here, but it makes me sad to see that sort of conversation happening like it's just a normal Monday. 

My step-father's mother was the type of foster parent OP describes. I was eight or so when my mom married into the family and we visited for Christmas. Being an only child, I was ecstatic that there would be other children to play with. Instead, I was told all the foster kids had to stay upstairs Christmas morning, because Christmas was for family only, and I couldn't go up there (she kept them in the attic room) because there was lice in the bedding. I was terrified and never wanted to go back. My mom called CPS on her I think, but I don't think it affected her license. She did it because it was her Christian duty. 

My family went on to have our own problems, but when my parents couldn't do their job, my grandparents were there to step in - and they were wonderful role models. Because of both experiences, I really wanted to be a foster parent and be one of the ""good"" ones.

"d6vn0st","&gt;I think some of these can apply to a non-dating scenario if the conversation is going in a similar vein. If you have politely indicated that you aren't interested in talking to someone and they keep trying to force the conversation then they are being the rude one, and sometimes you have to be abrupt to get them to stop.

It depends.  Sometimes people's desire to not talk is not that strong and so if someone really wants to talk then it can be overcome.  

&gt;If a situation makes someone feels uncomfortable, pressured, or in danger then I think they have a right to get themselves out of it.

Of course they do.  But the fact is that talking and being nice doesn't add appreciably to the danger.  You are in the situation either way.

&gt;And we know that an actual violent assault due to a rejection is rare, but think of it like this: You have a bowl of 100 jelly beans in a jar, and someone tells you somewhere in that bowl two of those jelly beans are full of cyanide. You don't know where they are or what they looks like but there are two really deadly jelly beans in that bowl. Now logically the chances of you eating either of those jelly beans are pretty slim, but wouldn't you be pretty cautious when eating one? It's the same with talking to men we don't know. They may know that they are nice decent fellows who can take rejection well, but women don't know that for sure and we don't want to take a chance with our safety and well being if someone is acting in a way that that individual woman finds threatening.

For one we are talking more like one in hundreds of thousands to millions of m&amp;ms given how rare stranger assault of women is.  The analogy also fails because talking to someone or being polite and understanding is not the risky action.  It could well be argued that being polite makes people less likely to be violent, and arguing otherwise seems contrary to the vast majority of human behaviour.  I don't see any reason to think that giving people a tiny bit of your time and not judging them is going to appreciably increase your chance of getting a violent reaction.

&gt; I can guarantee that 9.9999999/10 times he would not be labeled as ""creepy"".

Considering even the things said in this thread your statistics there are way off.  You seem to be doing what most women seem to do when discussing these topics and assuming that you and your friends are the same when it comes to men as most women, when in fact women can be very different.

&gt;And I totally get that approaching someone can be a really nerve-wracking and brave thing for guys to do. After having approached a few guys myself I don't envy the pressure a lot of men feel to make the first move. Rejection sucks, but this thread is about guys who don't take that rejection well and keep pursuing the person they're talking to after they've made it clear they aren't interested. I think that only after the guy keeps pushing after a clear ""no"" is it appropriate to give a much harsher response than ""no thanks"". It is definitly rude and totally uncalled for if the first thing after a guy says ""hello"" is the response of something cruel or demeaning.

The problem isn't specifically what is said (women in my experience tend to not be overtly rude), but the attitude that is so prevalent in this thread. You can tell when people think you are dangerous, scum, morally bankrupt and the like.   There is no reason for such an attitude, and it makes people react more negatively to you. This thread could have been about ""how can I make rejection less painful for guys that approach me"" instead of about how to trick or fool those awful guys.

You don't even have to do much differently.  At most you have to talk to someone for an extra minute and change how you think of them; there is no requirement that you spend time with them or anything else that might put you in additional danger.

&gt;  Description book **The Good Neighbor by A.J. Banner**:

&gt;  I don't even know where to start in on this shitfest. Honestly. It was terrible. TERRIBLE. For a quote-unquote ""psychological thriller"" that is less than 200 pages long, it took me forever to read, because every other sentence I'd have to stop my eyes from trying to roll out of my head. This was quite possibly the stupidest thing I've read all year, and that includes Sliver, which previously held that esteemed honor. At least Sliver kinda had a plot. This garbage had no plot, no point, nothing. Zip, zero, zilch. Which, thankfully, is also what I paid for it, so I guess all I've really lost is a couple dozen IQ points and two days of my life. I don't really have the energy to recap this book. It's too stupid, and trying to lay it out in a coherent and concise way for anyone reading my review would just take more patience than I have.The plot was non-existent, and the resolution came completely out of left field. Of course, none of the book made any sense at all, so maybe it was just trying to fit in. There were too many characters, and they were all bullshit stock characters, and all of them were OH SO BEAUTIFUL. Breathtakingly beautiful. Stunning, gorgeous, voluptuous (unless one needs to be waiflike in memory!), sultry, etc. Every woman who lived next door to our main character was literally the world's most beautiful woman, and each successful in their own way. First was the model, who was successful at being pleasant to look at. Then there was the art person, who is so beautiful and successful at art that she can make paintings not be burnt anymore. Then there's the real estate agent who is so beautiful and successful that she could sell a house to a... house buying person. I don't fucking know. Didn't I just say that this book cost me IQ points? I rest my case. But to counter all these gorgeous vagina-bearers, there were men. I think. One who... did something? But he's dead now. Another one who looked really grumpy and rude. But he was only there for literally like one paragraph. Supposedly there's another guy... has a kid named after him? Ate dinner once? Yeah him. But then there's JOHNNY. JOHNNY is perfect! He is totally not controlling or creepy at all. I give you exhibit A, which finds us with Sarah (JOHNNY'S wife) following him on a run and watching him go into another woman's house. I had already broken a promise by clandestinely following my husband. You can always trust me, he'd said on our honeymoon. Never question my love for you. I had replied, I promise, and he had squeezed my hand, his gaze clear and unflinching. I want this marriage to work, so you have to talk to me. Tell me everything that's on your mind. Right away. Don't hide anything. Don't omit any details. Johnny would have a good explanation [for secretly visiting another woman's home].Yeah. See? Totally not weird or big flashing warning signish at all! JOHNNY is perfect and leaves newspapers strewn on the counter, and cooks, and leaves crumbs under his chair, but knows that his wife's favorite foods are challah bread and... fucking I don't know, she lost me at challah bread. Is that really a thing? Challah being a favorite food? It's bread. BREAD. Pretty bread, tasty bread, but just... fucking... bread. I wonder if the crumbs are from the bread, and whether JOHNNY'S wife gets upset at the waste. Also: Also JOHNNY wraps his arms around his wife person. Because that is love and stuff. Well that's how you SHOW love, apparently. How you TELL love is this nauseating phrase: ""I love you only."" I think that's supposed to be sweet, in a saccharine fucking nightmare world, but MY cynical ass is like ""Why are you specifying? Got something to hide?"" I kinda feel sorry for JOHNNY, actually, because the author has no fucking idea what to do with him. He is either a perfect husband, or the cheating asshole. The author can't make up her mind, but doesn't have the guts to go full on bad-guy, because you know, then she - I mean the main character, who is totally not author wish fulfillment material - wouldn't have a man, and remember all those beautiful women? They all are validated by men... except the crazy one. So, the moral of this story is: if you don't have a man, you're a psychotic murderer. There were some other people in the book, I mean, names of people, since they never actually APPEARED in the book. But whatever. I'm over the cardboard characters. Let's get to the ""writing"". Because OH GOLLY GEE, wasn't THAT a blast. This... I can't. I had to stop there and go back and put those quotation marks around the word writing in the last sentence. These are a collection of random sentences that occasionally go together, but more often are just bizarrely placed. During dialogue, it's like the people are having two completely different discussions. Random descriptive detail is added at the most awkward times, and things happen, only to be a convenient method of getting to a given outcome, and then the thing that happened will just be completely glossed over or forgotten. For instance, a 4 year old little girl steals a pair of shoes from a store and runs out to lock herself in the narrator's car, where she ""conveniently"" forgot her keys. The purpose of this was to get a teenager who was with them to tempt the little girl out of the car with ""magical princess makeup"" - which the narrator recognizes from the ENGRAVED INITIALS on the lipstick and compact (because apparently people do that?) and confronts her about it, because those belonged to the little girl's dead mother. The fact that the little girl stole shoes is completely forgotten, and in fact later on in the story, she still has the fucking shoes. So not only did her theft and running away go unpunished, even unscolded, but one is to assume that she was actually rewarded for it. But the more pressing matter is the confrontation of the teen who has lipstick that didn't belong to her. Of course. Chapters are ended in the most awkward times, I'm guessing in an attempt at suspense, but it was just pathetic. And speaking of pathetic, I pegged the killer the absolute moment she was introduced, and then every single time she was around, I just couldn't understand how everyone else seemed oblivious to her. Ridiculous. This book was awful. Not the worst I've ever read, but if I'd paid money for it, I damn sure would be getting that refund. Save your time and brain cells and use them on something worthwhile.

"czqs6pf","Yes it's gotten pretty out of hand. I can understand some of it, people are upset, the show might not live up to expectation but that's not reason to inexplicably bash it for no reason. I personally like the show, I find it interesting. But it's got a few issues. Some of the stuff is legitimately immature and rude but some stuff said are real problems and flaws the show has- episodes feeling too quick and rushed, plot being too convenient sometimes, and some characters seemingly not being able to do anything wrong (I'm looking at you Sabine). Believe it or not however the conflict goes two ways.

"czjtecq","So let me get this straight:

- You have never performed any sort of evocation before, meaning you have no skill in this area, and may not get any results, but you're still choosing it as your chosen method of verification.
- You're doing it in a graveyard where a bird rustling in the branches of a tree is probably going to make you all shit bricks and think it worked whether it did or not.
- You're choosing a demon for your evocation, meaning that even if your scepticism were entirely correct and such things didn't exist, you'd probably lay the seeds in your mind to spend a long time worrying about what happened or didn't happen - and if your scepticism proves to be misguided, you're inviting an entity that is more than happy to fuck you (and not in the fun kinky way) into your life. You're also doing it in a rude and unprofessional manner, meaning said demon has even more of an excuse to delivering an ass whooping. You're also doing it at a burial grounds, meaning probably engendering an ass-whooping from a whole lot of other local spirits too.

This all reeks of someone whose impression of the occult is Ouija boards and horror movies, or paranormal investigation documentaries.

---

I really hope you don't take this as me being rude, but literally everything about your plan is pretty much a bad idea.

Okay, so now to propose a solution:

- If you really want to perform any sort of evocation, and get your evidence, you're going to have to be a little more patient. While you might not have the patience for years of study, you could certainly pick up a copy of **Franz Bardon's Practice of Magical Evocation** and read that from cover to cover before doing anything.
- If you just want quick proof that there's more to this world than meets the eye, then there's a simple and easy way to do this. Today, out loud, ask the universe, God, your relevant deity in question, your subconscious, whichever of those seems most fitting to you - for some kind of proof. Say it out loud, and specify that you are giving him/her/it one week to answer a question of your choice. Now, this is where the hardest part of this simple method comes in, you must, sincerely, give it the benefit of the doubt, put your previous scepticism aside and say ""Alright, for one week, I'll completely get behind this idea, and give it some belief, and if I see my proof, I'll accept it. If I don't, I go back to the way I was before. Simple"". At some point during the week you are going to feel drawn to a particular book, maybe one you own, maybe one in a library, or one that a friend shows you. You'll know when. At that point, open the book, to the page you feel like opening it to. Now read. Was the answer suitable? ;) I have never seen this method fail once and it probably has a higher rate of converting sceptics to believers than anything else I know of.
- Back to evocation, if you must start already, start with benevolent entities. The angels/archangels, friendly nature spirits, deceased ancestors/relatives of yours that you were on good terms with. Don't go to them just for proof, but think of something they could genuinely help you with, and when performing the evocation, petition them for it. See with little experience in occult practice you probably aren't going to see or hear anything at this stage, at best you might feel some kind of presence. You can however verify if you succeeded by if they answer your request. A good simple one is ask to receive a nice surprise of some kind during the next 24 hours. If you aren't sure what to pick out of angels, archangels, nature spirits, or other benevolent entities, my advice is trying one of the archangels. They're pretty accommodating and won't be annoyed by someone inexperienced or sceptical calling upon them, and will usually answer your request or point you in the right direction to answer it yourself.

I suggest the instructions in the Franz Bardon book I mentioned, but if you're working with the archangels, the process of their evocation can be as simple as chanting or vibrating (resonating your voice, a bit like when you hear monks chanting ""OMMMM"") their name repeatedly 3-4 times. After you have done this, whether you feel like they've arrived or not, act as if they have. Greet them, state your intentions, ask for whatever help you need, then thank them for helping you (yes, you should thank any entities you ask for help **before** you receive it, as if it was already received. This is a token of you having faith that they'll complete your request.), bid them farewell, and let things be.

Almost forgot, four archangels that you may already be familiar with and that are suitable for general requests (albeit all having their own speciality): Raphael, Michael, Gabriel, Uriel. When you vibrate the names, vibrate each syllable, i.e. ""RA-PHA-EL"". I recommend 4 times, and then making your request as stated above.

Hope this helps. :)

Speaking in another accent is offensive and can be considered racist because it is often going off of stereotypes, depending on the person doing it.  Mocking the accent of a British person is slightly different, because most people understand English (and also don't understand British accents, but that's another conversation).  Attempting to emulate an ""Indian"" accent or an ""Asian"" accent is often composed of stereotypical gibberish that is often meant to be insulting.  For instance, my mother had a student that turned to a Vietnamese teacher, and said, ""Ching ching chong, what I say in your ranguage?""  essentially making fun of Chinese (I think) and also the stereotypical ""Chinese"" accent.

"cuqlz1n","This is so true.  Every time I visit my parents they find a way of working in some kind of ""gospel message."" I am expected to sit and listen respectfully, never disagree or question.  Yet if I am even slightly critical, even in an indirect way, I am being rude and disrespectful.  

I think in the future if I am invited to a family social event and they start some kind of ""gospel lesson""  I am going to get up and walk out.  They will think I'm being rude, but it is rude and inappropriate for them to constantly preach at me and my children when they KNOW I DONT AGREE or believe.

"cu7ts1x","I would avoid La Piazza Allegra. My wife and her cousin had a terrible time there. Here the cousin's review (copied/pasted from TripAdvisor.ca)

I have been to La Piazza several times and have always enjoyed myself. After my experience there this evening I will never go back.

We went to celebrate a special occasion with some friends, after an hour and a half our entrees arrived. Several of the woman in our party ordered the same meal - which they returned because the chicken was dry and the sauce was too sweet and had a burnt aftertaste - all three agreed that they didn't enjoy it.

After sending it back, the restaurants owner/chef approached our table only to verbally assault us, insult us and laid his hands on one of the woman in our party.

He was not only incredibly unprofessional and rude but he also had the nerve to tell us we were never welcome in his restaurant again - as if we would return after this.

We were than charged for all of our meals - even the ones we returned - which we refused to pay for and one very kind server finally removed the charges from our bills.
As we were finally leaving, the owner/chef stood at the door, taunting us as we left and again insulting our guest of honour.

"cu7r867","Quoting /u/todoloqueentiendo 

Ron gets more shit than nearly any other character in the series but I think he's wonderful.
First Year: Generally people complain that he made Hermione cry and said she had no friends and other mean things. He was right though. Hermione was being a stuck up bitch and what he said was mean and rude but at the end of the day she humiliated him and he reacted like an 11 year old. But he made it up to her, he fought a troll to save her and then became her friend. At the end of the year he sacrificed himself, frankly risking death, in order that Harry and Hermione can go on with no thought to his own safety.
Second Year: Now Ron has spent his whole life being told Slytherins are evil and parseltoungue=dark magic. Yet when his best friend is caught speaking the language and is widely believed to be Slytherins heir, being bullied in the corridors, does he abandon him? No of course not, he's too loyal. Then at the end of the year he goes to fight Slytherins monster because his friend and sister were hurt, facing death for the ones he loves.
Third Year: Hermione was a bitch and went behind their backs about the broom, didn't even think to mention that she went to speak to McGonagall. She was also wrong about it being cursed as much as she was right about it being from Sirius. She also was heartless about Scabbers (idgaf that he was Wormtail, she was still heartless about her cat having ""killed"" his pet). Ron again reacts normally,hurt by his friend but he can't stay mad for long and ultimately forgives her. End of the year Ron stands up to what he believes is a mass murderer ""if you want to kill Harry you'll have to kill me too"". He's also there for Harry all year when a murderer is trying to kill him, not even when Sirius ""almost kills"" him with a knife in the dorms does he try and distance himself from Harry. He stands by his friend.
Fourth Year: This is the only thing I have against him, shitty thing to do but I can still understand it, he believes Harry put his name in the Goblet. Imagine you're Ron though. You spend weeks dreaming that maybe you'll be picked for the tournament, yeah you're underage but maybe just maybe you'll get to shine for once publicly and do something none of your brothers got to do, make your Mum proud and hey maybe Hermione will notice...she's been getting cute lately. But nah it's your famous bff. He reacts like a normal teenager. You know what though? End of the year there's not one doubt in his mind about Harry saying that Voldemorts back despite much less evidence.
Fifth Year: They were right not to write to him, one wrong word could have been a disaster for the Order. Harry was being a child, they were at war and couldn't risk any sensitive information being leaked. He spends the entire year supporting Harry being a little bitch, he defies the ministry and trains for the fight ahead mastering magic many adults cant do (on that note his Patronus? A dog. Loyal to a fault). End of the year he goes to fight Death Eaters at the ministry because his friend had a dream and he knew fighting Voldemort (who he thought would be there) was the right thing to do.
Sixth Year: He is nothing but a good friend. He even does the mature thing and hooks up with Lavender because he accepts nothings happening with Hermione. Also, at this point he knows his best friend is prophesied to kill or be killed by the most powerful dark wizard in history. Does he run away? Nope, he duels said dark wizards followers at the end of the year and pledges his loyalty to Harry on what seems like an impossible mission.
Seventh Year: So Harry has no family and Hermione hides hers in Australia with no one noticing cause their muggles, grand. Ron on the other hand by the time he leaves for the hunt has one earless brother and another mauled by a werewolf. He doesn't have to go, Hermione and Harry can't go back to Hogwarts cause mudblood and chosen one. Ron can. Ginny does, Neville does, Luna does. Ron goes on the hunt anyway, putting himself and his family at risk. He's also human and worries about them, then they get a Horcrux, great.
By this point his sister has been in a Death Eater ran school for 3 months and 2 of his brothers are being hunted for taking a stand and his whole family is under surveillance, (this is especially worrying as they are involved in a long term lie about him being sick). If they are caught they will be tortured into insanity and killed. He still goes because he knows it is the right thing to do. He also goes without a clear idea of what is going to happen but he goes because he knows his friend has a plan, except he has no fucking clue.
Then the Horcrux plays on all of this and he snaps and in a moment of weakness, after hearing his sister was punished at the school she is trapped in ran by Death Eaters and no one but him even pauses to think about it, Harry tells him to go and he does. He immediately regrets it and tried to go back but Harry and Hermione have already left, it's not his fault they didn't wait and he couldn't find them.
He eventually comes back, after being completely off the hook, saves Harry's life and destroys a Horcrux, overcoming his insecurities and completing the growth of the most compelling character arcs in the books. The scenes with the mirror in The Philosophers Stone, when Harry catches him sneaking out to practice Quidditch and the horcrux lays out every problem with Ron perfectly; his insecurities about his family, not being good enough for his mother, the girl he loves preferring his friend, being the weak member of the group. The Horcrux then throws all this and more back at him...so he stabs it in the face. Because he has finally realised he is good enough, that he does have value and that he should be happy with who he is.
We also see a notable change in him from this point on. He is much more confidant and calm, he gets Hermione and is able to be possibly the most valuable he has been in the entire series.
He then goes on to help destroy 2/3 remaining horcruxes, fights in the Battle of Hogwarts and is one of only three people to directly stare down Voldemort and defy him (""He beat you"") and continues to fight for what is right, even knowing Harry is dead and being one of only two people who knew the prophecy he actually thought the fight was futile at that point but he kept going because it was the right thing to do.
Ron is the heart of the trio, he's the only one who shows true character growth in a realistic manner. Sure he makes mistakes but he overcomes them and ultimately becomes a better person for it. He can be insensitive at times but he more than makes up for it by being the most loyal and decent person in the series.",1439947628,"hermione was being a stuck up bitch and what he said was mean and rude but at the end of the day she humiliated him and he reacted like an 11 year old.","mean and rude","rude",NA,FALSE,"mean and rude","mean",NA,NA,0

"cti4nm8","I'm sorry... but this

&gt; I have had over 70 companies make it sound like I was going to be hired, all of them negotiated pay had me walk inside the building and told me my starting date, they all said that they seen no reason to not hire me, when I double checked with them ""Is there any reason you might not hire me?"" I would ask them and 100% of the time they say no. Then they pick another candidate.

&amp;nbsp;...is bullshit. You have not had over 70 jobs offered to you and then rescinded at the last minute. One or two I'd believe. That happens. It's extremely unprofessional and rude, but it happens. But it **does not** happen over 70 times to the same person.

For some perspective... in one of your comments you said you've only been coding for a year. Let's assume you somehow started (successfully) job hunting the day you started coding (which is also a bullshit assumption). That gives us roughly 365 days. If this has happened to you over 70 times, that means you've literally been hired and then fired once a week every week. Sometimes twice a week. I seriously doubt that's even a little bit plausible.

But let's assume you aren't lying. Then I can only guess that you're misunderstanding the process. There are often multiple rounds of interviews before you receive a job offer. Perhaps you're making it through the first round(s), filling out some more serious paperwork, and then not cutting it in the later stages. My only real suggestion for that problem is more technical studying. I wouldn't be surprised at all that someone with no experience and only a year of programming under their belt wouldn't make it past a second round interview.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; I can't sue people for this?

You could certainly try. The term you're looking for is promissory estoppel. But that's a long and difficult path with very little chance of success.

"ctbrd27","For The Little Mermaid, it depends what one's definition of feminism is. The first Part of That World song essentially describes Ariel as having body disphoria. It's easy to apply that song to the transgender movement.

Forgive me. Some people think transgenderism should be part of the feminist cause, and others do not. Without transgenderism, there's not much feminism of note in The Little Mermaid. I'll say that the woman and hero are both women, and Ariel being an interesting female character almost makes it a feminist movie by default because of how hard it is to find those in film. (It's been a year since I've seen Frozen or The Little Mermaid, so it's tough to put up a great defense for them.)

---

Basically the lesson is that I haven't seen very many feminist movies.

I've written a response to that *Frozen* article already, luckily for me. The response is mostly me tearing apart the article without offering my own case for why Frozen *is* feminist, so here it is:

Elsa chooses her own identity. Compare this to something like Disney's *Mulan*, in which Mulan is forced to act like a man.

---

Once again Let it Go is called [award]-bait. Apparently feminists are allowed to take power away from people who they don't think deserve it. And the idea that a character isn't good because they have personality flaws (which actually exist in the real world) is discriminatory to the point of disgust.

The practices described in Let It Go are not healthy but they are logical short-term decisions based on what Elsa has put up with. Eventually she would come around, or could be persuaded to return. Anna came up within the next day. If she waited a week, a month, a year, she'd be more open to discussion. Again, Elsa had just lived her life in a cage, and she can't even go a day without having to be put back in a cage. Of course she'd find that frightening.

&gt;Faced with her misdeeds, Elsa sets a golem on her sister and has to be dragged back to Arendelle in chains when she’s knocked unconscious by her own chandelier. This is not a strong woman. This is a frightened, repressed, vulnerable woman who starts running at the beginning of the movie and doesn’t stop until her sister literally turns to ice in front of her.

Women can't be strong unless they're physically strong? And if you're strong, you're not allowed to be bested ever? If the (male) Avengers are so strong, how come they occasionally face setbacks? Why isn't the movie just the unstoppable Avengers, going bowling and eating pizza, free from any threat?

Strong character to me means well-developed and/or realistic character. It has nothing to do with physical strength or even emotional strength. Don't believe me? A weak character isn't one who can't bench-press 50 pounds - a weak character is one dreamed up in 5 minutes by a toy department.

&gt;Elsa is a relatable antagonist who claims her identity and tells us it’s okay to be an individual.

No. Elsa is a relatable antagonist who claims her identity and tells us it’s okay to be an individual. She also shows us how hurtful individualism and selfishness can be.

The movie doesn't end with Anna's heart getting Frozen, does it? Character development can happen during the whole thing, right?

&gt;Quick trivia question: in how many Disney princess movies is the day saved by True Love’s Kiss™?

Who said that was the question? ""True love"" is pervasive in Disney, in fairy tales, and in culture as a whole. It's a really important concept to address, kiss or no.

The ""It gets worse."" sub-section is probably the worst of this whole article. The well-meaning trolls are comedic interpretations of the well-meaning parents and relatives who hope that anyone brought home or mentioned might finally be what gets them some grandkids.

The trolls are naive. It's a joke. They are rude and they don't know any better. They're desperate for their adopted son to finally have a girlfriend / wife. And do you [the author of the article, that is, not you the reader] really think Kristoff would have nonconsensual sex with Anna? Or that the trolls endorse that? At worst, the trolls say ""get married first and you'll fall for each other later. Just give it a shot!"". So imagine traditional courtship but with an arranged marriage at the beginning. Nobody's getting raped, a troll marriage isn't legally binding (and might be more casual in troll culture than human culture), and neither the trolls nor Kristoff are going to keep her there against her will.

""Her quote engagement is a flex arrangement"" -  this woman is the only chance the trolls have for their son, so they ignore and twist the truth to suit them. Naive and rude, not rape-endorsing.

&gt;And what’s worse is that we agree with the trolls. That moment reads as comedic because the audience isn’t expected to respect Anna’s agency either. We’ve already assumed she’ll end up with Kristoff. We’ve made the choice for her too.

Uh, thanks? I expected that because Kristoff is one of two relevant male characters in the movie, and the movie was so obviously setting up some issue with Hans that he's the only remaining choice (if you assume she marries one). A million other Disney movies are predictable as well.

&gt;And, just like Hans, the trolls don’t suggest the match with Kristoff for Anna’s benefit. The song is about how she can fix him.

""We're only saying that love's a force that's powerful and strange. ... Throw a little love their way and you'll bring out their best.""

Basically, you might grow to like him. Not the best message in the world (again, rude), but if you take the trolls at their word, Anna's getting something out of this.

The writer has the luxury of taking the best elements of past movies and making one super, perfect movie. Frozen doesn't do some things as well as other movies, but the other movies you're comparing it to also aren't as good as Frozen in some other ways. Frozen is all-around good, which is less than you can say for some of the Disney movies that are 90% crap except for the one thing this writer brought up.

**Stick with these sections if you want just the more reasonable arguments:**

* Elsa claims her sexuality as well as her individuality! She’s a modern woman!
* But Elsa doesn’t end up with a guy — and she’s just as important as Anna! (1/2 credit for bringing up some smart points and some idiotic ones)

3 I made a lot of excuses
4 I did not weigh myself and only rarely looked in a mirror

My social circle was a bunch of fat, HAES loving, brownie recipe sharing, obese and diabetic women. I still love them, although they remind me of smokers who ignore all medical advice because they don't want to change.

"cqah12l","There are times when it's appropriate to say ""get the fuck over it"". Usually that happens if there's something I don't want to do but need to get done (i.e: homework, obligations, chores, etc.) Or if I have to attend a wedding or funeral and need to dress up very nicely for it, but don't feel like it. Well, tough, those events aren't about me, they're about the people being honored on the occasion. So that's a good time to say, ""get over it."" Usually because how you feel about those events simply do not matter and/or putting your feelings first would be selfish and rude.

But for something like this... yeah, I was taught to think and discuss my feelings, and that for the most part my feelings (and others') are valuable.

But this time, there's two sides to this situation. One would be the guy's, where he doesn't want to have to get up even *earlier* than usual (and maybe he doesn't sleep well with others?), drive home, get ready for work, then go to work. The other is mine, where I'd get that feeling of being left/abandoned even with his logical explanation. Ultimately, communication, even lighthearted communication, would be really helpful here beforehand to get an idea of what both parties are expecting and why. Because really, what makes that hurt isn't just the fact that he's leaving, but that it feels like it's completely out of left field-- that's what gives it kick. If you know beforehand that he has to go at the end of the night, then your expectations can adjust accordingly. Does that make sense?

But yeah, you're probably right. Two different ways of reacting and dealing with something like this.

Setting up an IDE (Eclipse is easier, Intellij IDEA is more intuitive and arguably more powerful but v14 is a bit.. temperamental with ForgeGradle at the moment) and working through some tutorials will be of more benefit to both of you I think.

As for progression I would go; create a new item, then create a new block, then do something clever with the block (play around with redstone, blocklight, metadata, change the icons around based on criteria) then maybe make an ItemBlock to allow you to combine what you've learned. Then move on to a TileEntity - try to make an equivalent to one of the minecraft ones, a chest or a furnace or something - this will introduce you to GUIs and sync issues which are ""tons"" of fun and an interesting challenge to complete efficiently.

Once you've done that, try extending it, make it automatable with ISidedInventory or make it do something wacky with the items inside it.

As for tutorials and resources, I have heard very good things about VSWEs Summer Courses which take you from the very basics of Java to some of the intricacies of modding.

I can be found on #minechem a lot and (most) of us there are very helpful when we get chucked the odd question.

Additionally - Make the most of open source mods, look at what others have done and try to understand why they've done it that way, generally modders do things a little differently to the tutorials, so try to understand what extra capabilities are added by the way they've done it, as well as any limitations.

From Bob's perspective, nothing now changes. He and the rest of the party are just standing in a seemingly normal room. However, the rest of the party starts to act differently towards him.

"clwodjp","If I implied you were stupid for possibly not knowing the difference between a therapy animal and a service dog, I sincerely apologize. Having a service dog I run into people all of the time who are genuinely confused not because they are stupid but because they are not well informed.

And as far as telling you not to eat the dogs food - that was flippant and rude. But, again with a service dog you cannot expect them to do anything that a reasonable person wouldn't do. Your roommate relaxes in your room presumably without sleeping on your bed, licking your things or contaminating your stuff. A service dog would be no different. Even while relaxing you could expect it to stay on her side of the room. And your roommate somehow manages to feed herself without contaminating the room, I don't see how a service dog would be an issue. 

As to why I'm being an arse, do you seriously not see how coming to a forum of disabled people with service dogs who potentially face discrimination for their disability on a daily basis and asking about kicking your roommate out of her room might strike a nerve? Do you not see how rude and self centered that is?? If you want to be prepared for her arguments in this situation, you should expect demanding her to move to probably strike a nerve with her as well.

And no I will not relent on the it could be worse point. I get it your young, you love your dorm community, it's a big part of your identity and you do have a medical condition that limits part of your social interaction by not being able to eat out freely with people. But here's the thing legally none of that matters, at all. And I'm sure when you're older you'll look back and realize how much that pales in comparison to being disabled. 

Let's say you need to go to the bank, what do you do to prepare? What about the library? Or the post office? Or the movies? Can you just go and do those things? 

As someone who spent two months of the past year in the hospital, who sees a doctor an average of 2.5 times per week, who lives in constant fear of rudeness and (illegal) refusal of service based on my disability, it's extremely hard to not be rude to someone who is asking how to best discriminate against someones disability. 

As much as I love my SD and would not be able to function without him (it's humiliating to be in your mid-20s and NEED your parents to go to the grocery store with you), I would give anything to not be disabled. I would give anything to be able to just go to the bank on my own with no preparations or concerns.

So seriously, just take a breath and a step back and realize that the likelihood of your roommate getting a service dog before the year is out is low. And even if it happens, the chances that it would affect you at all is basically nothing - whatever your roommate does to feed herself without bothering you should work for the dog to. And even if somehow your allergies are bothered by the dog, you have no idea someone might love dogs and be dying to switch with you so you can stay in your community. And absolute worst case scenario, you have to live in a different dorm which makes seeing your friends in your current dorm slightly more of a hassle. **It definitely could be worse.**

PS Seriously you would expect your roommate to feed the dog raw food? Like dog sashimi 24/7? And the biggest issue you see with this is the fridge size??

"clm6fc6","catharsis, thy name is Joss.

I'm sure some people are sick of me repeating this story every time this episode is mentioned but...

I first started watching buffy at the insistence of a friend.   It was shortly after my mother had died of cancer.   I got to season 5 and had another friend warn me season 5 might trigger some emotions I didn't want to deal with.   I asked the friend who had pointed me to it what he thought.   He had forgotten about this episode and told me he saw no problems.   So I watched.

I hit this episode.   I bawled my eyes out.  It took me 3 hours to get through it, because I kept pausing it to cry.   BUT it was a good cry.  See I had been in the throes of deep depression even before my mom had died, and her death only made it worse.  But depression is.. a disconnect, even my moms death was very emotionless and cold to me.

This episode finally gave me that release, that chance to REALLY feel the loss, for the first time, even though it had happened a few months ago.   Yes it was painful and horrible to watch, but when it was done, I felt better.  Empty, sure, but a clean empty.   An alive empty.  

I can even point to the scene where I felt the most connected, the moment I felt most connected to a charecter.   I know everyone loves anya's monologue, but that wasn't it.   It was Xander's wall punch.   THAT was what I felt like.   His answer to whether it helped was exactly right ""for about a second""... except I would have added ""and that second was worth it"" because it hurts that much.

Even 5 years later, any time I feel the loss bubbling inside of me, and can't seem to just get in the good cry i know will help, I will go back to this episode and let it help me find release.  I think I have watched it every year on her birthday since she died now.

The first few times I saw it, I hated the end.   Bringing the vampire in seemed... inappropriate and rude.  But now I get it.  The vampire was a message.   ""Life goes on.""   While you are lost in your sufferering, and your friends and family are creating a world where you can grieve, the rest of the world simply doesn't care, and moves on anyway.

"ckwq7pd","They are really polite. Friends have commented how I have been involuntarily bowing when saying thank you since returning to America. As foreigners, it is extra important for us to be polite, so that we don't look bad. If you are being too polite with friends, they'll tell you and then you can adjust downward. Friends are much more casual, and it is interesting to see them switch politeness levels when interacting with someone else. 

This is a somewhat related anecdote, but if you ever have the privilege to watch a movie in a Japanese cinema, I'm not sure you'll ever want to watch a movie elsewhere ever again. Utter silence. No cellphones for the most part. It's amazing how you can get hundreds of people into a single room and not really hear anything from anyone. The one time I went to the cinema with foreigners it was very embarrassing because they were just acting like they'd do in America. I don't subscribe to the ""I'm a foreigner. I will never understand Japanese culture and I'm not meant to get it, so I'll just do whatever"" mentality.

As for anime, people will say its not a good study tool because anime characters tend to be direct and rude, but if once you reach a familiarity with the language, you'll find different levels of politeness. Of course, if someone is really polite in an anime, they tend to really exaggerate it but it's still interesting to see the different characterizations. As for the internet, I'd say they are still normally polite like in real life. Keep in mind I'm basing this off of their version of Yahoo Answers and the like for when I'm looking for clarity about word differences. I haven't used a site like 2chan.

"ckcfg4m","It is a classic thing you notice when dealing with both Americans and Europeans.


Americans in Europe often describe Europeans to be a little bit cold and unfriendly, while Europeans traveling the US often complain about all the fake friendliness. Both views are true, because of our cultural differences. 


I'm from Central Europe, too, and people can be a bit closed off. But most interactions are much more honest, direct and genuine. What you see is what you get.  
Americans, on the other hand, often appear to be fake and spend so much effort on an apparently skin-deep joviality. But they often are just open, friendly and curious and use positive interactions as social lubricant. They often won't say negative things directly, rather choosing a more subtle approach to get the message across.  
At my company we have people from several European countries and also from the US - it takes new employees some time to adjust to people from ""across the pond"". Americans actually teach other Americans not to take things we say personally - that we are not rude, but just direct and mean well. On the flipside we teach Europeans (mostly Germans and Austrians) to read more between the lines when dealing with Americans and add more niceties.

"ckccw2k","I don't think they are, really! I live in Paris and, being from the French countryside, I grew up having quite a poor opinion of Parisians, but I really think it's just a misunderstanding. People seem to accept that New Yorkers, who live in one of the biggest and busiest cities on Earth, can sometimes be snappy and rude, but somehow Parisians aren't allowed to be, despite living in a big capital too? Many tourists tend to forget that just because it's quaint and pretty, Paris isn't a theme park (I'm sure you're not like that though).  

Contrary to what many people think, politeness is actually very important in France, and in Paris too. The problem is that most of the rules are unwritten. Many tourists, especially Americans, tend to expect cultural differences and odd social norms when going to exotic places likes Japan or China, but assume that everything in France works just like at home. It doesn't: some things that Americans think is polite, French people will think is rude. It's important to know what to expect and what to do, because while French people would usually give you a pass if you don't abide by every little unwritten rule, Parisians who have to deal with tourists all year long might not be as understanding. Here are a few things to keep in mind:  

* You shouldn't walk up to people in the street and start asking for directions right away. You have to say hello, apologize for disturbing, wait for them to say hello back, and then you can ask what you wanted to ask. It sounds complicated, but it's a second nature to most people here and forgetting it might result in people answering very snappily or even walking away. Seriously: I like to think I'm a relatively nice person and I love to help out tourists, but when they walk up to you in the street and just go ""hello I want to know how to go wherever"" without letting you say a word, it's extremely annoying and doesn't make me want to help them very much.  

* Little shops like bakeries and such aren't public spaces: you have to say hello when entering, even if the shopkeeper can't hear you, and idealy say goodbye when leaving. The divide between public and private spaces isn't the same in France than in America, at all, and those little shops are considered extensions of the owner's home (they often actually are), so you have to behave like you would in a home, and say hello. It's a little thing, but it'll be appreciated and the shopkeeper will be that much friendlier towards you! You don't have to do it in big supermarkets and the like, though. 

* Waiters. What to do, what to do. You've probably heard everything about Parisians waiters, and it's true that some of them are downright unpleasant. As a rule of thumb, avoid touristy spots when eating or drinking, they're too expensive anyway. A good example of something that Americans find polite that is considered rude in France is the check: French waiters won't bring you the check until you ask. An American might think it's rude and that they're being ignored, but it's actually bringing the check unsolicited that would be considered rude in France: it pretty much means the restaurant is asking you to get out.  

* Last thing: smiling. By American politeness conventions, it's pretty much a requirement. It simply isn't in France, so don't think people dislike you or anything if they don't smile when talking to you, we only smile when we mean it. You can take advantage of your vacation in France to relax you facial muscles!

Having said that...

The Dutch like to follow rules, value their afterwork time (if you want to visit a Dutch person be sure to make an appointment beforehand), they like the environment A LOT and are very environment-conscious which also results in a very clean country. While rules are there to be followed, the Dutch are also lenient if they realize you crossed a rule by genuine mistake/lack of knowledge. It's not uncommon for tourists to get by with just a warning because they got the wrong train ticket or got in the wrong train. In fact, I have to say that whenever I was in need and Dutch people were nearby, I've always been helped to the best extent they could (e.g. frozen bike lock, needing a tool to disassemble a bike wheel).

Now, if you need their help, indeed, if you *ask* for their help and it's inconvenient (because they're busy or whatever), they *will* tell you and most likely will not help you. To be fair, I think this is what's expected. Although in some countries people do really go out of their way to help others even if it's inconvenient.

"chvntof","Your char is definitely a huge tank. AC 17 with Aura of Antipathy is probably the single most broken thing thing you can do with multi class--I'm not sure WotC knew of that synergy during design.

I honestly wound never worry about going toe to toe with anything from the play test packet (barring über powerful things). A giant that has to roll a 12 or better and choose the worse of two will seldom hit.

That being said, you've sacrificed raw melee prowess due to the multiclass. Except for your daily dramatic spells, you're mostly a 1d8+3 per round kind of guy. Your 6th level wizard friend will be blowing stuff away with 6d6 fireball while you're still pumping 3d6 burning hands. Your 6th level fighter friend is attacking twice and reaping greater pathway benefits. Unfortunately, this often causes the DM to just ignore you in combat, as you're too hard to hit and you're not as much of a danger as everyone else. 

Keep burning hands, but I'd really focus on status effect spells: cause fear, sleep, etc. And you really don't need shield. That one time you get hit next play session you'll probably hate me, but if you've never seen AC 17 aura of antipathy before, you're in for a treat (so's your DM). Characters increase their offensive capabilities by being able to finish the battle quickly, which can be done by turning a person unconscious.

Oh, and not to be rude but Shocking Grasp is just A weaker long sword attack. Consider another utility cantrip.

Now your offense is not bad per se, your spells will be good when they go off and you have action surge. From here on out, I recommend favoring one class and dabbling a bit in the other in order to increase offense. Consider 5/15 wizard or 8/12 wizard.

"chmhj40","I worked at a utility company in customer service for a little over 2 years. There are many stories I could tell but this one was my favourite.

A woman calls in and I answer. Immediately she asks to speak to a man. Not any man in particular just a man instead of a woman. I can get nothing out of her except that she has to speak to a man and not a woman. 

I ask my manager if he will take the call, he's annoyed that I can't even get an account number or name from her but he takes the call with me listening in for training.

As soon as the customer hears a male voice she opens up, she happily gives her account number and answers the data protection questions without problem. 

So, why has she called? 

She's having problems paying her bills. It's not that she can't afford them, it's that she physically can't make payments because she has a phobia of paper. She refuses to open any letters she gets unless she absolutely has to. Now she fears any letter she gets that she's not expecting as well because putting off opening her letters has got her into some trouble and a lot of her letters are final demands and cut off notices.

My manager is the epitome of patience with her. He talks to her about the phobia and ways around it. They talk about setting up a direct debit and online accounts. He works out how much she needs to pay a month to cover her bills and the accrued debt. He arranges a home visit to help her get the accounts set up because she's basically inept.

Every solution he gave her, she would stutter and say ""I can't!"" and tell us what she was afraid of. Paper, letters, strangers, other women, the computer, dealing with money, leaving the house. This woman couldn't do anything for herself but she did at least accept that she had to pay her bills.

"cg2nh1r","The accounts of feminists who ""attacked and threatened"" Pizzey are muddy, and in her own AMAs here she more or less admits she has no proof that any threats against her were from feminists. The example of ""harassment"" that she provided was of a particularly ornery female book publisher who told her that her books were worthless and didn't deserve another printing. I don't know if I'd agree with that, and it seems harsh and rude, but that doesn't really constitute a threat. Also, you have to bear in mind that a publisher of scholarly books has every right to reject Erin Pizzey as an authority on anything because she didn't apply academic rigor to her sociological books, and indeed has no type of degree in any stripe of sociology. The whole ""violent feminists and Erin Pizzey"" thing seems to have stemmed from one incident, when she was involved in a radfem group who wanted to blow up a large chain store - I think it was a Harrod's but I can't remember now - and that (pretty sensibly) put her off of feminist groups.

You also have to take the context of the time into consideration. EVERY ""liberation"" group - the Black Panthers are an example that history has made sure comes to mind - talked of violence as a revolutionary tactic in the early 70s. Margaret Atwood has written more than once about Canadian Nationalist groups who wanted to blow up the Peace Bridge between Toronto and Buffalo as a symbolic fuck off for the US. Social change groups all pushed the envelope with that sort of stuff. Very few had the stomach to follow through. Those who did were mostly killed or thrown in jail.

Erin Pizzey can't cite a single example of anyone actually saying to her, ""You can't say that women are as violent as men, and if you do say so, we'll fucking take you out"".

Perhaps they weren’t even dumb but it was my tolerance for idiocy that was nil because I owned a place in a building that was treated by some of its tenants worse than ANY apartment building I had ever lived in.


I mean, people couldn’t figure out how to use a garbage shoot. For months the shoots were jammed/in need of a good unjamming because of things being improperly disposed of. People were constantly running into the garage doors with their cars too.


Aside from the folks who lived there, the condo fees were something else I slowly became tired of. Let’s just say, never buy a place you still pay rent for. The sudden 36% jump in condo fees was a real hoot.


Considering the amount of complaining on the Facebook group for the building and issues that went on without resolution (also complained about on the Facebook group), I think I got off rather easily. I was lucky enough to have zero issues with my unit. I’ll still NEVER live in a condo ever again.
It was, however, very nice being represented by a condo board that was pretty great. All members were experienced and dealt incredibly well with what was tossed at them. Having a gym in the building was really convenient too. The media room was awesome until someone stole the projector.

Since I have grown up in a Puerto Rican family, it is tradition that a group of people will go over to a friends/family members house and do this festive sort of christmas carol, but instead of just doing it outside, they knock on the door, you open it, and then they play and just kind of barge in. It sounds like it would be unwelcome and rude, but its the best part of the holiday IMO. They come in and all of a sudden, everyone is singing and dancing, and they usually have guitars and guiros and other puerto rican instruments, and its just an all around good time.

"ccoql7k","Here are my 2 cents.

You may not think that you are being rude, but many times your demeanor does come off as condescending and inconsiderate.  You need to remember that people work hard on the stories that you pull and it's only human to fight back when they feel they've been unfairly treated.  Telling someone that ""those are the rules and if you don't like it post somewhere else"" is disrespectful.   You don't contribute content yourself so you may not know how much it stings to have your story removed. 

Stories should be pulled for violating the rules of the sub.  Nowhere in the sidebar does it say you have the right to pull a story just because you don't find it ""scary"".  I read the story in question in the [Unwritten Rules](http://www.reddit.com/r/ShortScaryStoriesOOC/comments/1o14ni/unwritten_rules_or_why_waste_my_time_here/) post and I do believe you overstepped your bounds.  Non-scary stories should only be pulled unless they're obvious trolls.  Let the system Reddit has put in place do the rest.  If people don't like it they will not upvote it.

Also I was told this user was banned by you.   Banning said user because they used the OOC to vent their frustrations was unjust.  People are going to complain about mods whether they are in the right or not.  You were not insulted or even mentioned by name.  They were stating why they disagreed with your actions.  If this was in fact the only reason that user was banned then once again, not cool.  I am interested to hear your side of the story.

I'm glad you are working to make the reason for pulling stories more objective.  That's a good thing.

I've been told by many talented writers that the absurd enforcement of the guidelines of this sub and their treatment are reasons they no longer write here.  To me this is a problem.  Losing good writers in the community brings down the content of the sub.   If it could have been avoided by treating someone with more respect, then you are partially to blame.

Lastly I know you genuinely want this community to do well.  You spend quite a bit of your time here and I would know, I do too.  Hopefully now , you will work with the community to improve it.  We all want what is best for the sub and we should all have input.

"cckzejn","Well, firstly, I'm going to say that your comments can definitely been seen as racist, or at the very least, very rude. To say ""Why are the Chinese so rude and disgusting"" is definitely not a good way to ask your question, even if you excused genuine hate. Secondly, I'm hoping that someone else can answer your questions better than myself, as, despite living in China for a year, I still feel naive to a lot of Chinese culture.

It's a really different culture. You can't ask why they don't understand common decency because you're thinking about it from what you and your culture considers polite! Chinese culture has very different considerations. When I first arrived in China I was very angry that I would be shoved out of the way to get on a bus. I mean, I'm British, where were the queues!? Then I realised, after missing a few buses, there are so many people that you have to be a little forceful or you'll miss out. Imagine being raised in a family of 15 and cookies only come in packs of 12. Tiny Tim better bring his A Game if he wants some chocolate chip. Despite the pushing, there's still a lot of care. Elderly folk and those with children we're respected and given seats or made room for.  

With regards to spitting. I can't answer much more than, it's considered healthy. I spent a night in a temple and, the next morning, the halls were echoing with the sound of phlegm being coughed up. I learned that it's to remove the badness from ones body. Who am I to argue? Of course, I may feel that it's rude but that's why it's a different, wonderful culture. Shit, if the world said ""Sorry!"" As much as British people, we wouldn't get anywhere. My American wife still laughs when I say ""Sorry, please could I have some water?""

I made lots of cultural mistakes while I was there. I was too forward nod caused a lot of people to lose face. ""DeZoet, would you like to come for dinner?"" I would be asked and sometimes I would reply ""No, thanks."" To not make an excuse and to be so direct, especially in front of others, caused loss of face. In other places I was too polite, and some friends told me this could be seen as offensive as it creates a wall between you and the other person, one that deters true familiarity.

I can't give you an in-depth, Reddit gold worthy explanation reaching back through Chinese history. But I can recommend you go there. See the people, try and witness the culture first hand. It's different, it really is. It will challenge your conceptions of rude and polite and would hopefully make you realise that your standard of living and what is socially acceptable doesn't hold up universally.",1380902981,"to say ""why are the chinese so rude and disgusting"" is definitely not a good way to ask your question, even if you excused genuine hate.","rude and disgusting","rude",NA,FALSE,"so rude and disgusting","disgusting","so",NA,1

Let alone the assumption that atheism is a result of teenagers trying to rebel/establish their identities. Adolescents have always been around, growing up and rebelling as they like to do, but secularization is a very modern thing.

But:

I might be remembering my history wrong, but I thought that in 3000 BC, there were only a small scattering of civilizations complex enough to even have kings or emperors (if they could really be considered that)...I think the first monarchs were only in ~3100 BC or thereabouts.

So how did people start turning from ""God"" to kings and emperors, two ages before these were even starting to exist? Am I getting my history wrong, or does this belief system you've explained reject archaeological and historical records?

Nevermind that the year you mark as the beginning of a decline, not just in spiritual but in moral and social terms, was around the time civilizations began to rise and become stable.

"caxnu56","I think the intended effect of segregation was to allow racist white people to stay away from black people, and separating cultures was most likely a secondary byproduct.

Stereotyping is to say ""you are black, so you must be louder in public than someone who is not black."" Stereotyping is not saying that black people tend to be more openly gregarious. An Asian stereotype is that they're all great at math. It is not a stereotype to say that Asians as a group do better at math.

You should not be laughed out of the thread for pointing out that white people are quieter on trains. It probably is non-controversial to say that white culture is more subdued in public. What's ridiculous is to then ascribe these differences in culture to individual differences. It's different to say ""white people are quieter in public because that is their social norm"" than to say ""white people are quiet because they're all so unfriendly."" Differences in culture should be OK to acknowledge and even choose to like or dislike. 

But my point is that racism occurs not when these differences are pointed out but when one is made inferior to another.

The younger monk noticed the woman, said nothing, and walked by. The older monk quickly picked her up and put her on his back, transported her across the water, and put her down on the other side. She didn't thank the older monk, she just shoved him out of the way and departed.
As they continued on their way, the young monk was brooding and preoccupied. After several hours, unable to hold his silence, he spoke out. “That woman back there was very selfish and rude, but you picked her up on your back and carried her! Then she didn't even thank you!”

Your hair is one of your biggest assets. It, along with your sense of style, is what most people will judge when they first look at you. Sad, but true. I understand these are just a couple of pictures you're taking of yourself at home and I myself rarely wear anything other than a wifebeater/t shirt + shorts at home.

So as for hair, you can go with the good ol' swept back that everyone is doing these days:

Being in highschool I know that this won't really be an option for you, because most 'big' changes in high school are met with teasing and such, but you could just do a military buzzcut. That way you can let your hair grow out to lengths that you've never really seen it, and test what looks good on you and on your facial/body structure. Like someone said earlier, work out. Don't go to the gym and just start pumping iron; but get fit. Athletic. Know your way around your own body so that you can begin exploring the outside world. Don't fall into a clique. Never let yourself feel comfortable by looking the same as the people around you. Be original. Do yo thang, brother.

What you do or don't believe in is your own business, and so long as you keep it that way, I have no problem with it.

Even then, I probably wouldn't have come out because I don't feel a compulsive need to talk about it, but my family was complaining about her atheism and bemoaning about where they could have gone wrong to ""raise an atheist"", so I came out mostly as a way of defending her and pointing out that yes, she may be rude, but she's not the irrational one.

  You say that they should just drop everything and get a real job, how? Are you going to pay the rent for them while they look for that mythical trade job? Are you going to pay for the training? Are you going to look after their kids while they do all this?

  It is not as simple as you think, many work on those jobs because they are stuck in them, every town and city is different, some have a few good jobs that you can get into if you try hard enough and some just don't, those who live in the areas that don't are not going to be able to afford the cost of moving to a area that does because they are stuck, they are not making enough and have very few short term options.

  You seem to think that everyone who works in retail is only there because they are too stupid or too lazy to handle anything else, that is absurd, probably the most absurd thing anyone could ever say on the subject.

  We are slowly but surely moving to a service based economy, getting a job outside of retail and fast food might get harder than you seem to think as companies continue to move manufacturing overseas at the rate they currently are.

Maybe because it's not a Vita game.  I don't want to be rude, but contrary to what I keep seeing here and elsewhere on the internet, there is nothing special about PSN games that would make them magically work on the Vita.  They are just like any other PS3 game, but available only digitally.

To get a game onto the Vita would be like getting the game on any other platform.  It's a different console with different hardware and different architecture.  It costs a fair amount of money to port the game after the fact and the Vita user base isn't large enough to support that, especially since downloadable titles sell far fewer copies than retail games.

If the game was developed with cross platform capability in mind, or on a middle ware engine that supports multiple consoles without extra work, then yeah, sure, ask for it, I'm all for more games being available.  But the truth is that this is rarely the case, and even games built on middle ware engines that support the Vita would still need a lot of work.

I'm not sure where the idea that the Vita could run PSN/PS3/PS2 titles out of the box came from, but it's just not the case.  I don't want to sound like a stick in the mud, but it seems the first page or /r/Vita is made up of people asking why title X isn't on the Vita as if it's some trivial task to bring it over.

&gt;
&gt; As they continued on their way, the young monk was brooding and preoccupied. After several hours, unable to hold his silence, he spoke out. “That woman back there was very selfish and rude, but you picked her up on your back and carried her! Then she didn’t even thank you!”

I am going to assume that you truly don't understand how anything you said could have been construed as having better morals.  I'll lay it out for you.  I'm truly not trying to be mean, I'm just making an attempt to explain why people may have issue with what you have said.

1. You asked someone flat out why her 17 year old cat was put to sleep.  That's a little rude, but forgivable, seeing as you may just be very, very curious and less tactful because, hey, it's the internet.

2. After an explanation of some pretty awful issues (for the cat), you tell her you would have put on a topical analgesic and sang to her.  As soothing as that may have been, that only treats the symptoms, while completely disregarding the underlying problems.  A sore mouth is not the only issues that cat would have had.  It came across as rude, and a bit presumptuous, as if they wouldn't have tried various things before they made the agonizing decision to put their pet to sleep.

3.  &gt;""If possible you did that right. I personally will NEVER euthanize an animal.""

Don't you think this could come across as mean or as a condescending?  You then told a story about your grandma who didn't give up and said how if she were a cat she would have been put down.  When you do that, it seems like you're showing an allegorical situation to this woman's, and saying how quick people are to kill animals off... likely including her cat.

While I'm writing this out, I want to point out a couple more things: Your uncle may have had more reasons for putting his dog down than it was just pooping everywhere.  Maybe he wasn't comfortable discussing it.  Maybe it got too hard to explain to everyone.  Maybe it was easier to let people think he was just an asshole than to break down trying to explain how he did so much to save the dog, and in the end there was more and more wrong with the dog and it was cruel to keep the dog hanging on.

Also, painkillers can be hard to keep pets on, so it's not quite as easy to keep pets free from pain when they're sick.  Painkillers often repress an animal's appetite and its desire to drink water.  Combined with already sick pets, this can actually decrease the quality of its life.  With people, we can explain to them why we need them to continue eating and drinking, and it's a bit easier to give them IVs when necessary.",1343447242,"that's a little rude, but forgivable, seeing as you may just be very, very curious and less tactful because, hey, it's the internet.","rude, but forgivable","rude","but",TRUE,"rude , but forgivable","forgivable",NA,NA,1

To answer your question about whether arts courses are actually easier than math/engineering courses:
What constitutes a light course load is very subjective. What constitutes as easy is subjective as well.

Having read some of your other submissions now I understand your care but the division of children between adopted and *biological* (I dislike the word ""birth"" for some reason, but I digress) is a touchy thing especially for adopted children who are also part of the audience on this sub-reddit.

I guess I wonder if you would feel the need to apologize to children you felt didn't get enough attention if you had a biological child with special needs. (There is no need to actually answer that, I am musing out loud)

On that subject, I have a question and I do not mean this to seem rude but mental health although not my area of work or study is an area of interest to me; You say three of your children have Reactive Attachment Disorder and my understanding is that RAD is rather uncommon. Studies actually show that RAD is rare even in adopted children when they are placed in normative care-giving environments. 

RAD is a specific diagnosis for one particular attachment disorder but is not a blanket term for all attachment issues and is by far one of the rarest. 

My question is, have your children actually been diagnosed by a professional as having RAD? I ask not because I don't believe your children have attachment issues (I have attachment issues of my own) but simply out of curiosity.

"c3xwjdy","I'll say this one last time. You said if AA is necessary, minorities are less qualified than whites. Think about that sentence for a bit.  AA was not implemented because minorities are less qualified.  And Just because AA is necessary does not mean minorities are less qualified. 

When I say employers are biased, I mean all employers. If all the employers are white, they will all be biased to hire white people.  There's studies shown that a white male with a criminal record has a better chance of being hired than a black male with no record, even if they have the same qualifications. Your proposed solution that somehow someone else will hire the minority does not actually play out in real life.  And having qualified employees does not mean that the business will prosper.  That's being idealistic.

Secondly, white are almost never under represented in one field.  If they were underrepresented yes, than AA would make people hire white people.  However reality isn't like that. And yes, AA is biased.  But it is implemented on the premise that society is biased.  And that there has been a biased against minorities for the past hundreds of centuries.

Basically, dwarves aren't known for their diplomatic ways. By human standards, they are a crude people who drink too much and belch loudly too often, singing horrible drinking songs and smelling up the place since there's not a lot of bath tubs in mines. They're also a proud and loyal race who defend the weak and uphold good.

So keep in mind that, as an ambassador, you'd want your character to embody the traits of your people. If you're trying to ingratiate yourself to a fellow nation, you would probably show up with a keg of your strongest ale, plop it on the center of their throneroom, perch yourself on top, and challenge them all to a drinking contest (and probably doing so in such a way as to insult everyone present). Or when at a state dinner, instead of slicing off some of the roast beef, you'd probably pick up the whole thing, eat it right off the bone, then put your feet up on the table, lean back, and let out an echoing burp while picking your teeth with your fingernail.

To other people, these would be insulting and rude. But to a dwarf, you've just showed up not with an axe, but with a gift and a lighthearted challenge to prove your worth. At dinner, you showed your host that you appreciated the meal and that they served fine food. 

You're probably just starting out in your career (which is why they sent you out to the sort of places where you'd need to know how to fight just to stay alive on the roads), and you're probably not schooled very well in the ways of other peoples.

2) I honestly do seek the truth. That's why I am skeptical, scrutinizing and require evidence. If your faith is unbreakable, why are you in a debate forum? This is a place to exchange arguments, not see who can plug their ears the tightest. I am trying to tell you how to debate effectively. I am trying to get you to understand that you are completely unconvincing to anyone who really does seek the truth. This is because you are not using the language of truth (evidence), you are using the language of conmen (words, promises, threats).

3) I am far beyond reaffirming my lack of belief. I have been at this for a while now. I no longer think in terms of any higher power, eternal soul, or mystical presence. Debate stimulates my brain. I am a writer and it helps me create characters, dialog and plot. It creates fodder for my blog, where my readers see me as a source of reason and logic.

4) **You have dodged the issue by trying to reflect it back upon me.** I have made the case for why you should provide evidence. What I would like from you now is one of three things: Give me evidence, a counter-argument, or admit that you have no better tools in your toolbox than a conman.

5) Your last sentence merely proves my marketplace analogy. I cannot see the goods before I've purchased them.

6) According to the bible, the apostle Thomas was skeptical of the resurrection until Jesus showed himself. I don't see why my request for evidence is so outlandish.

7) Put yourself in my shoes (this is really the best thing anyone can do to understand the world). Imagine a man believes in a god named Xaxatharos. This man comes up to you and says, ""Xaxatharos is love. He wants nothing more than to love you. You must forfeit your false god and bow before Xaxatharos!"" Please, consider this. I'm guessing that you'd think 1) this guy is wrong and 2) there is some veiled hostility in his tone. Not only that, but you're pretty sure that the love he's talking about is not the love you're experiencing from your god, yet you use the same word. But the man persists, ""You must accept Xaxatharos into your heart and he will show you eternal life in endless bliss. If you do not, you will be judged. Your Christ is false!"" Now you're probably thinking that not only is this guy wrong and rude, but his premise is hard to believe from the get-go. I mean, he's asking you to just drop your hard-earned beliefs and jump ship to his. BUT, his accusations are serious and he REALLY believes it. In fact, he says, ""I know this more than I know anything else!"" So, what do you do? Well, you could ignore him, but he has political power because there are others who believe what he says and they vote. And these followers are single-issue voters; they vote for the politician who shares their spiritual beliefs, regardless of their economic and social policies. So, damn it, you feel compelled to make a difference. Maybe if you can make this guy see that Xaxatharos is not real, he'll stop trying to spread his brand of inanity.

"c2g5hvt","To be perfectly honest, I'd added that bit about ""indignant"" in my response mostly to preclude any complaints on ""but what about when he said..."" when holding you up as an example of how to act; it was largely a preemptive measure, and as I had not read all of your replies to that point, it was made on an assumption that someone would be annoyed enough to bring it up.

Of course, the idea that even after being indignant someone can still concede gracefully (if apologetically) is one I do stand by.

Still, I felt obliged to reread the entire thread to see if I can't give you a fair assessment because you have asked for my opinion - that'd be the scientist in me - and here are my conclusions:

* With [efrique](http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateReligion/comments/jwoqa/to_all_i_came_up_with_a_proof_that_god_exists/c2fps7i), you were irreverent in response to irreverence, but acceptably so.
* With [marleedox](http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateReligion/comments/jwoqa/to_all_i_came_up_with_a_proof_that_god_exists/c2fpuwk), you were civil.  When [Def-Star joined in](http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateReligion/comments/jwoqa/to_all_i_came_up_with_a_proof_that_god_exists/c2fqnpn), I would say that at the end, you were a little sore, arguably indignant - that would be the ""no need to be rude"" comment.  I'm afraid I must agree that he wasn't particularly rude, but merely assertive and direct.  As I have myself worried about being mistaken for the same thing, I can understand how he could be seen as rude, but I must advise slightly thicker skin in this circumstance; just because he's suggested you've failed does not make him rude.
* With [Def-star's main thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateReligion/comments/jwoqa/to_all_i_came_up_with_a_proof_that_god_exists/c2fqf3i), your initial response does come off as somewhat indignant - it's the ""correctly or not"" and the way you phrase the suggestion that he may not have read all of the original reply; I would recommend a replacement phrasing along the lines of ""I worry that you may have skipped my notes; I was under the impression they solved issues x, y, and z that you present.  Could you clarify your objections?"".  Your second reply, and [the second time you refer him back to the OP](http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateReligion/comments/jwoqa/to_all_i_came_up_with_a_proof_that_god_exists/c2fqveu) is much more polite and better phrased; that thread didn't come of as indignant.
* Your reply to [Rockran](http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateReligion/comments/jwoqa/to_all_i_came_up_with_a_proof_that_god_exists/c2frnqj) was justified, if it was *after* your edited concession.  I can't tell the exact timing, so I give you the benefit of the doubt.  From there, thisiswhatyouget's assertion seems out of place - you are somewhat indignant in the following [reply](http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateReligion/comments/jwoqa/to_all_i_came_up_with_a_proof_that_god_exists/c2frthn), (especially the edit), but it's not exactly unexpected with the tone he took.
* With [lymn](http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateReligion/comments/jwoqa/to_all_i_came_up_with_a_proof_that_god_exists/c2fqfjb), you're fine.
* With [rynomachine](http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateReligion/comments/jwoqa/to_all_i_came_up_with_a_proof_that_god_exists/c2fr00v), you're quite civil, as you were with all the following, similar people when informing them that you had conceded.
* There are a few more we could tackle, but all the important discussions after that point were civil as well; none of them even reached the degree of being heated much less offensive.

So, in conclusion, no: you had not been indignant in your responses with limited exception or interpretation.  Over all, the grand majority were both polite and inquisitive.  There were a few cases you got a little touchy, but with perhaps one exception they were in response to similar tones.  And in that regard, while my original statement implicated you as indignant, do allow me to apologize for that.

I wish to keep my first post as-is, because I feel it is important to remember that even if we feel slighted somehow, or if we've been undeservedly unpleasant when proven wrong, we can still concede and apologize.  

But in regards to you, specifically, I'd say you did fine.  Not that there's nothing to improve, of course, but you don't deserve a waggle of my finger, and the ""do you realize you tell every single person that they are either being rude, or tell them arrogantly to read your post again?"" bit was unfounded.

"c2c5wd3","Oh dude, you are so fucking barking up the wrong tree.  I'm a published author on the Crusades and hold a PhD in Medieval Studies.  

I know the span, despite your incorrect citation.  The Crusades, as you would understand in academia, were a defensive action.   As early as the 7th century Muslim armies were knocking on European doors.  By the 8th they had taken much of present day Spain and were knocking on the doors of Paris.    A solid Frankish leader defeated them there and Christendom had since been defending themselves, when not fighting against themselves,  against this hyper expansive force.  The Crusades were simply the first time Christendom was able to launch a coherent and connected COUNTER-ATTACK against what had been previously captured.

Your understanding of this event is typical of your generation.  Mindless cliche-driven outrage whoring.  Please read a book.

One of the world's leading Medieval specialists writes:

&gt; Now put this down in your notebook, because it will be on the test: The crusades were in every way 
        a defensive war. They were the West's belated response to the Muslim conquest of fully two-thirds 
        of the Christian world. While the Arabs were busy in the seventh through the tenth centuries winning 
        an opulent and sophisticated empire, Europe was defending itself against outside invaders and then 
        digging out from the mess they left behind. Only in the eleventh century were Europeans able to take 
        much notice of the East. The event that led to the crusades was the Turkish conquest of most of 
        Christian Asia Minor (modern Turkey). The Christian emperor in Constantinople, faced with the loss 
        of half of his empire, appealed for help to the rude but energetic Europeans. He got it

In the end, it's because they have the confidence to do something interesting now and then. It's not because they're assholes. It's because people who are rude but interesting tend to be more fun than people who are kind but dull.

"c1n8twb","&gt;Who gives that advice? 

I have, but that's coupled with the advice to be courteous, read body language and back off if she/he isn't receptive to it. When someone is working, it could be rude to hit on someone in front of other customers or co-workers. But I don't think it would be rude to discretely pass your phone number or email and offer a coffee date, forever leaving you alone if you choose to not contact them. Anyhow, whether it's rude or not has a lot to do with the recipient. I'm very open, outspoken and assertive. I'm not offended when I'm hit on. I'm flattered.


&gt;I personally do not being hit on ever.

You're entitled to be how you are, but wow! You never want to be hit on? Please don't put people in the rude catagory for wanting to get to know you better. (Some people actually are rude, but most people I'd guess are just being friendly.) And some of these experiences might not be ""hitting on you,"" but flirty friendliness instead. If you're that awkward, you may not know the difference. If you want a better time of dealing with the outside world, change your attitude about it and find ways to respond so you don't feel so awkward. (Because they're not going to change for you.)

Try some new things. If someone tells you that you're pretty, look them in the eyes and confidently say, ""Thank you."" If someone asks you for your number or for a date, look them in the eyes, be happy and confident and say, ""That's flattering, but I'm not dating. I'm way too busy. Thanks, though."" You'll get better at it. Be friendly. Thank people for compliments. When a man compliments you, odds are he's not trying to offend. He might not even be hitting on you. This is just how a good portion of society interacts. 

I'm not trying to be rough on you. I just really think you should change your attitude and develop skills to deal with this and maybe even turn it into something positive where you enjoy the interactions. 

I had an old man hit on me not long ago. He was actually being rude and sleazy about it, but I'm not one to be offended.

In a rhetorical spirit, one could ask ""is hating Islam the same thing as hating Muslims"". I believe in Christianity, and I have had people say to me that they hate Christianity. It doesn't follow that because people hate Christianity that they hate me.

There are hundreds of videos of people burning the Bible and the Qur'an on youtube.

not all atheists are alike, just like not all christians are alike. this would be out group dynamics at work. it's a mentality that religion particularly causes. WE are unique individuals with differing view points, we are people. THEY are the same all one, the unformed uniform OTHER.
We don't think you have the 'Truth' (tm). we think you are wrong. some of us try to convince others of that, some of us don't. Some of us are rude, some of us are not.

"c0vyzrr","Right here! I lived in Berlin for a year and just came back to the States about a week ago, as Charisma said. Honestly, though, the advice that has been given here is really everything I was going to say. The Germans aren't much for beating around the bush. They're not rude, but small talk just isn't something they engage in as often as we do. Your best bet is to go by the apartment, greet them in German and ask if they can speak English (this is just a courtesy thing, as most Germans do have a working knowledge of English), and then explain your situation. In my experience I never got the cold shoulder before being given at least a chance to explain myself; they would listen, and if the answer was ""no,"" that's what they'd say, and likewise for ""yes."" But if their plants are in a window, it's probably reasonable for them to expect to get a few questions from inquiring minds, so I'm sure it won't seem totally out of the blue.

I will say that the first time I saw really excellent bud in Germany was when I was studying with some friends at the beginning of the semester. When I asked where one of the guys had gotten it, he'd said from a friend. When I asked if he could hook me up with his friend so I could get some better stuff than I was getting in the parks at the time, he seemed a little uncomfortable and seemed to imply that his dealer only dealt to personal friends. You may have to exert a little extra effort to really befriend the person/people in the apartment, but if you're able to find weed elsewhere (like in the parks or something), even if it's kind of schwaggy, you may be able to use that as a pretense, something like ""I saw your plants and I have some weed of my own, I was wondering if you wanted to smoke sometime.""

tl;dr - Give it a shot. Start out in what German you know (introducing yourself, asking if they can speak English), and explain yourself thoroughly but politely, and you'll probably have good results, especially if they're younger (late teens to early 20s). I wish I could give you some more specialized advice, but really it's a similar situation to what you'll find everywhere else.

Good luck!

"c0ukqdi","Your response to that quote of Dr Howell's is fallacious, an *argumentum ad hominem*. Is what that paragraph says wrong? You're side-stepping it completely and simply attacking the man.

With regard to ""antipodal"" evidence, you have used the correct term if you are from the northern hemisphere. My friend is not ""lactase"" intolerant; rather it is because he cannot produce his own lactase that he is *lactose* intolerant. The FDA's ""information point #8"" is disingenuous: while pasteurised milk certainly doesn't *cause* lactose intolerance, it can most certainly make life temporarily miserable for those without the genetic ability to manufacture lactase. The FDA is diverting attention from the question that should have been posed: ""Can drinking pasteurized milk cause issues for people with lactose intolerance?"" The answer to that question is, of course, a resounding *yes*.

If you were confused and wished to speak of anecdotal evidence, I would comment that while anecdotal evidence does not make something true, it also does not make something false either. Anecdotal evidence can be rated as to its reliability by: 1)  the number of eyewitnesses, testimonials and claims; 2)  the consistency of the observations and claims; 3)  the credibility of the witnesses; 4)  the clarity of and proximity of the observation; and 5)  The state of mind of the witnesses. Bearing these in mind, I have confidence in the anecdotal evidence of my friend and his family about pasteurised milk causing him discomfort. The FDA's ""information point #8"", that pasteurised milk doesn't cause lactose intolerance I would also be pretty confident in, since I'm of the understanding that the inability of someone to produce their own lactase is genetic, and not caused by the milk. But the FDA's point addresses a different issue, so your use of it to attempt to imply my friend is a liar is not only rude, but erroneous as well.

Re your remark on shelf life, I was not comparing shelf life at all. If that subject interests you, then feel free to look into it. If keeping milk around for long periods is more important to you than freshness, there's always the unrefrigerated dead ultra-pasteurised milk that stores well in its box for six months or more. 

&gt;*I guess I can see how you would feel that it should be your right*

If not an individual's right to choose what he eats, are you saying then with the ""FDA taking steps"" that a US Federal government organisation instead has the right to decide what food citizens put in their mouths? Please, can you point me to the paragraph in the US Constitution where this right over food choice is granted to the government? Not being from the USA, this authoritarian concept I find surprising and shocking.

If you feel happy trusting the Federal Disinformation Agency, I wish you the very [best of luck](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB120225742208745785.html), as their food monitoring is reportedly [sketchy](http://www.cspinet.org/new/200707171.html) and their drug advice tends to kill and harm a lot of people.

Some others include a 2009 report of some FDA scientists [who stated](http://www.healthcarepackaging.com/archives/2009/01/fda_scandal_bursts_but_quietly.php) the FDA is ""fundamentally broken,"" and ""corrupted and distorted by current FDA managers, thereby placing the American people at risk."" As recently as July 2010 the FDA is hard at work protecting industry, making sure that the drug [Avandia](http://www.foodconsumer.org/newsite/Non-food/Drug/diabetes_drug_avandia_should_stay_on_the_market_1607100206.html), which may raise heart attack probability by 43%, stays on the market.

You yourself resort to anecdotal evidence in quoting four news articles (two of which are about the same story). If you've ever known the truth of an incident and then seen it presented in the media, you would know that it's possible for stories to have an ""angle"" which can portray events in a particular light. But let's look at these ""resent"" (sent again?) articles more closely.. 

* ""Illness halts"" &amp; ""15 Fall Ill"" - the latter article on Alexandre Family EcoDairy Farms is brief and slanted, but the former is longer and includes illuminating details. The health department officer stated the food poisoning ""*appeared* to come from the same source"".. but this does not sound conclusive. [It's reported](http://www.triplicate.com/2008081696352/News/Local-News/Illness-halts-raw-milk-progra) that the farm owner, 

&gt;""Alexandre also questions whether the Campylobacter came from his farm. *He said he spoke to a person who is listed by the county health department as contracting the infection who said he didn't even drink raw milk during the time of the outbreak.*"". ""Campylobacter can be contracted through eating undercooked meats or by drinking water that has been contaminated by Campylobacter, such as if animal faeces with the bacteria in it was in contact with the water. ""

In other words, as soon as raw milk was found to be in a victim's diet, the search for a culprit unscientifically stopped, and guilt was established by assumption. If you take a look at [this old CDC chart](http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00044241.htm#00002040.htm) I was able to find, in 1989 you were more likely to contract food poisoning from fruit &amp; vegetables, ham, salad and beef than from milk. Of the 48 cases listed for milk, it's not broken down into pasteurised and non-pasteurised products, but we can assume some of each would be in there. Even though your Bnet article suggests the figure for raw milk is higher at almost 200 in 2002, can the claim be trusted if statistics are generated by assumptions such as seems to be the case in the Alexandre Family EcoDairy Farms incident.

* The ""[Boulder county"" article](http://www.coloradodaily.com/ci_15422954#axzz0tsnxJETv) mentions at the end that 60 raw milk dairies exist in Colorado and that claimed food poisoning at just 2 dairies has affected just 36 people in the last 5 years. Assuming the claims are correct, these are pretty small numbers, and nobody's died - it's not another Vioxx scandal, by any means. I'd be interested to find out the food poisoning data for pasteurised dairy and other products in Colorado for some context.

* The Fiji Times story ""Dairy Farms under quarantine"" is about bovine brucellosis (the bovine strain has been eradicated in Australia, just as a point of passing interest). There, with the fourth paragraph all to itself, is the statement 

&gt;""Boiling of raw milk does not kill the pathogen bacteria"" 

What were you trying to prove with this article? Don't you know that pasteurisation is just heating milk to 72C for 15-20 seconds, and not boiling it? If subjecting milk to higher temperature by boiling isn't going to kill the brucellosis pathogen, then what use do you think pasteurisation would be? None at all, obviously!

It's sad to see how, in the last century, fear propaganda has turned people away from foods that nourished the human race for time out of mind and allowed it to flourish, and directed them towards nutrient-depleted, artificial, and low-value substitutes; which have seen the rates of heart disease, cancer, diabetes, obesity, osteoporosis, arthritis, and other chronic diseases keep increasing, despite advances in medical science. Something is very wrong with official food and [medical](http://www.wnd.com/index.php?pageId=41256) advice, and more and more [people are realising it](http://www4.dr-rath-foundation.org/pharmaceutical_business/pharmaceutical_industry.htm), notwithstanding strident attempts to maintain the economically profitable status quo.",1279483018,"but the fda's point addresses a different issue, so your use of it to attempt to imply my friend is a liar is not only rude, but erroneous as well.","rude, but erroneous","rude","but",TRUE,"only rude , but erroneous","erroneous","only",NA,1

"c0or9s5","Hold on here.

I've had a fair bit to drink here so I apologise in advance for any mistakes I make.

Economics is not a pure science no. Nor is any number of topics which I imagine you would happily believe that the 'experts' know what they're doing.

I consider myself a mathematician. In this respect even the pure sciences are 'inferior' if you were to rate their logical 'purity'. Economics is just further along the scale but no less valid; it is impossible to generate meaningful conclusions regarding the subject using the scientific method just as it is impossible to generate meaningful conclusions in, say, Physics by just taking arbitrary axioms and applying logic.

I apologise for being possibly rude and insulting, but it seems that the groupthink effect in Reddit leads to the belief that *science* is somehow superior to all other academic disciplines. The scientific method is merely the approach of finding the theories which maximise the accuracy when predicting future events using the same initial conditions. This *cannot* be applied to economics because we cannot have control experiments.

Your assertion that economists are somehow inferior because they are not science is absolute shit. Its less pure, yes, but that is a problem with the nature of the problem, not the technique. Economists are some of the most intelligent people I have ever met. Economists are not idiots, in fact I'd hazard a guess that most postgrad level economics students are a damn sight more intelligent than yourself. I apologise for being rude, but I honestly feel you've been deeply unfair here, based upon some kind of false superiority complex.

Economics is what is termed a social science. Its much *harder* than a true science because you cannot enforce the same kind of rigid initial conditions in your experiments which enable you to make rock solid conclusions.

It's true that he announces he'll give an A to anyone who does not submit a paper, but he announces it as, ""I announce at every class that I will give an A to anyone not submitting a paper, so that people will not submit papers that I have to read."" The effect was more to make us all more paranoid and likely to work hard. He did not assign any readings until, two weeks into the class, a frightened young lady raised her hand and asked if he would at any point be assigning readings. He assigned a ton of Hegel. The next week, the first half of the class was a lecture on Hegel, with some responses to questions. Then we took a smoke break. During the break, a student had asked Zizek his opinion of Spielberg's films, and Zizek's response spilled over into the resumption of class. He ended up providing an 90-minute lecture on how all of Spielberg's films are ""redemption of the father"" narratives. What amazed us was not so much that he was right, but that he could be so convincing in such a spontaneous manner.

"c0juv5b","Good to hear you're ready to start doing this on your own.  I didn't really learn to start saving until my car died and I had to spend a few months scrounging to pay for a new one.  I've definitely got it down now. Anyway, here are some high-level thoughts.

* There's going to be lots of good advice here but I just want to stress one thing. The most important rule of saving money is to **know where your money is going.** Once you know that then you can actually know how to cut into your spending.  There are a ton of good ways to save money listed here and you can get started right away (read: don't put off saving money) but you won't be maximally effective until you know which spending habits are hurting you the most.  Take a month and write down all of your expenditures.  I mean everything.  Then analyze and go from there.  

* Also keep track of the mediums in which you spend your money.  For me, the biggest hurdle to financial flexibility for me was ATM withdrawals.  I learned that when I have cash in my pocket I spend it FAST.  It's also hard to track how cash is spent out, so it was like a huge chunk of my money was disappearing into a black hole.  Not to mention the ATM withdrawal fees:  $20 a month!  In any case once I started limiting my cash expenditures I started paying more attention to the things I was buying, and started spending less as a result.  I'm not recommending that *you* switch away from cash though; that's just an example of how paying attention to your spending medium can help you big time.

* You're not paying any interest on credit cards, are you?  If so, I don't mean to be rude but fucking stop it right now.   Pay off the CC with the highest interest rate first.  When it's paid, cancel the card and redirect payments to the next card.  You should not have more than 2 CC's and you should carry a 0 balance on ALL of them. When you're done with this redirect the now-large sum towards savings.

* Get yourself to having 3-8 months of your expenditures in liquid savings, then worry about investing elsewhere.

* Find out if your company does 401k matching.  If they do, invest at least that percentage.  It's free money.

* As you get raises in your job, redirect the pay increase towards savings or paying off old debts, and live the same way.

* Don't consider utility costs to be set in stone. Is there cheaper car insurance in your area? Can you manage with a cheaper cell phone plan or cable tv plan? Can you survive with only a cell phone instead of cell+home phones? Do you really need a web connection at home if you have one at work? All of these things can save you big money, but your needs may vary :).

I guess the discourse was too difficult for you.  I wasn't talking about someone from my old highschool days.  That's a standard post-modern refutation: I was pretending to be his student.

But hey, if someone who takes such pride in what they believe is their own pedantry wants to get butthurt at me for doing what they're so proud of in themselves that they name themselves for the strength of their own tendency, who am I to laugh and say ""hypocrite?""

Yeah, it's such a jerk thing to do to use scientific definitions of scientific words, as opposed to colloquialisms that mean the exact opposite and are wrong.  I'm appalled!  Appalled.

&gt; When someone called you out,

They were wrong and condescending.  When people call me out and are right, I react well.  When people call me out and they're wrong, and they're polite, I react well.  When someone calls me out and is right and rude, I react well.

It's only when they're both wrong and rude that I do to them what I did this time.  Feel free to look through my reply history if you like; you're going to see a lot of rude, and a lot of kind.  I'm sure you'll find some bemusing way to explain away who gets what that doesn't come down to ""people who are both wrong and rude,"" but don't bother telling me, because I'm not particularly interested in what you believe my motives are.

&gt; When someone called you out, you simply threw definitions at him

Er, if you mean the impertinent and smug person, the reason I didn't argue with what they meant - that I was rude and condescending - is that they're quite correct.  I had been, in that post, and I'm not in any way embarrassed by it.

If you mean some other calling out, well, I'm not sure which one.  I have to assume you don't mean the one in this thread, because I didn't throw any definitions at them.

Incidentally, where I did throw definitions I also threw etymology, and that's a pretty significant difference in context.

The reason I was rude and condescending is that someone got up on a box and said ""I am right! Rahr!"" and was not.  They leaned on their authority, and indeed what they say they do for a living means they shouldn't be making these mistakes.  The only way this guy is going to come up to the quality of language that wouldn't get him flunked out of an average freshman discretionary writing course is for a remote party - in this case I was trying to become said party - to stand up and say ""hey jackass, your language is piss poor.""

Which is what I said, verbatim, though you seemed to fail to understand the parable structure.  For reference, there are a lot of children's stories that use that parable structure, and The Rocky and Bullwinkle Hour was particularly fond of that gag.  I'm pretty clear on how difficult it isn't.

If you don't like that, that's fine, but don't pretend there's any question of who's on what footing.  All you have to do is research the things I said; etymologies are easy to find for free online, and you'll find they agree with me.

"c0imwam","As an atheist I have a very simple test to determine if someone is Christian or not: I go by what they say.  Given my lack of involvement in that region (or any religion) I think it'd be not merely rude, but presumptuous and foolish for me to say that someone who professes to be a Christian isn't.

And, of course, as you say we get into No True Scotsman territory that way too.

Some Christian sects (Catholics especially) do provide explicit mechanisms for declaring that an individual is not considered, by the Church officials, to be a member of that sect.  But excommunication, and its various Protestant equivalents, is pretty rare, and that really describes more the attitude of the official church to its former members than the internal processes of the ex-member.

As for ""good morals and values"", that's always a somewhat slippery thing to define.  Most people don't think of themselves as evil, even when they do evil.  I'm sure that most of the people who supported Prop 8 in California were convinced that they were doing what was right.  It'd be nice to imagine them as cackling cartoon villains gleefully plotting to harm their fellow citizens, but I doubt that's true for more than a handful of them.  Mostly the people who do moral evil (such as supporting Prop 8) think of themselves as doing moral good.

Similarly, I'm certain that ""Bull"" Conner wasn't acting from what he considered to be evil motives when he so viciously attacked the civil rights protesters.  Rather, he most likely considered that he was acting from the ""good morals"" of protecting the social order, protecting society from the evils of integration, etc.  

Look at [this photo](http://contexts.org/socimages/2009/10/10/race-mixing-is-communism/), for example, of those who opposed integration.  Note especially the sign that is somewhat obscured by a person's head, it reads: ""STOP the race mixing march of the antichrist"".

The protesters in that picture weren't marching from what they thought of as bad morals, quite the opposite, they were convinced they were marching against immorality and for morality.

Like every other bit of genuine human knowledge, our understanding of morality improves over time.  People 500 years ago were less moral than people today, because they lacked our better understanding of morality.  Just as they were less healthy because they lacked our better understanding of disease.  People in the 1950's were less moral than people today for the same reason: they just didn't understand morality as well.

&gt;But in a relationship, to me, the key value is to fight for the relationship, for each other, and not being willing to give up.

Hmmm, there I think I may disagree completely.  A relationship shouldn't be a struggle, and if it is I think it's probably better to end it.  A certain degree of give and take, of working to make time to talk and whatnot, isn't a bad thing, but if maintaining a relationship becomes a genuine effort why continue it?  

Obviously there may be special circumstances, the relationship between people who need to cooperate because they're coworkers, for example, but even there I'd argue that when the effort of maintaining the relationship gets to a certain point it's better to find a different job and avoid possibly explosive relationship problems.

Even in the case of a couple with children, I don't think I can agree that it's best to maintain the relationship when it gets past a certain point.  Divorce is no good for kids, but it is likely better than parents who do nothing but scream at each other.

The truth is that I do largely agree that people with wildly different values aren't likely to form a good relationship, it isn't impossible I've seen it and likely so have you, but the likelihood isn't that great.

Where I disagree is with the idea that meddlesome people in positions of authority should make an effort to break up a relationship, especially armed with arguments from authority that one person in the relationship considers to be sinful to disagree with.  People make mistakes, that's how we learn.  If the OP and his girlfriend are incompatible, they'll find out soon enough and no harm done.

To me the situation, as described by the OP, looked like a clear and ugly case of atheist/agnostic/non-Christian bashing by youth minister.

"c0i8mky","Try to avoid ""So, do you come here often?"" type lines. 

I find it way better to start with some humor. Jokes are hard but poking fun at others isn't. If you're in a bar you could say something like ""Check it out that guy's sweater it's straight out of the 50's"". Or, ""Looks like that guy over is getting laid tonight"" (with or without sarcasm). Or ""Damn, I might have to go for double popped collars next time too, like that guy"" (sarcasm). ""Do you have a camera on your phone?"" - ""Euh yeah, why?""  - ""I want to get a photo of that guy's mullet / 'great' hair do, I'm getting a haircut myself tomorrow"". These are not chat up lines but a good way to fill a conversation and make her laugh. 

Girls love spying and commenting on other people's behavior and provided you don't overdo it and sound like a gay fashion designer, it's a great way to break the ice.

Girls also go for the funny / mysterious / slightly arrogant type alot more than the ""nice guys"" who spend the entire evening buying drinks, being polite and agreeing with everything she says. 

Get a drink for yourself and come back saying ""Sorry, you drink way too fast for me"" or ""You don't like _insert drink here_ anyway right?"" (while she blatantly does). The former line will set her back, worrying if she appears to be an alcoholic, and then she'll appreciate anyting nice you say after that so much more (""phew, I don't look like a freak""). 

This is being borderline rude but when tipsy she'll just try to figure out what that all meant exactly, and the intrigue starts there. Obviously the setting needs to be right and you need to say this with a slight smirk.

Also, offsetting your arrogance with self mocking works really well. Saying something like ""Shit, if I get on that dance floor you'd be embarrassed to have even spoken to me!"" should crack her up.

"c0h6ze2","Ok, here come the downmods. But, before I criticize, if you look at my previous posts, you'll see that my opinions are at least as unwelcome to the literalists (or ""happy clappers"") as they are to atheists (none of whom clap while they are happy). For those of you who are seeking citations, I've included a few, and will be happy to include more where requested. 

In order of his points:

1) Historicity of the existence of some guy named Jesus of Nazereth - he apparently discounts Josephus. We do know that Josephus was tampered with in later copies (which laughably had Josephus advocate for Jesus' divinity), but the reason we know this is because we found earlier copies (which still include Jesus as a brief aside, just not the divinity claims). In addition, we know that Christianity as a sect is referenced in a manner that is consistent with the founder's death in the early-mid 1st century CE. If one is going to assume that the cult's basis was a founder who had not actually lived, one need suggest why he was invented. Regardless of what one thinks about Jesus in terms of faith, the simplest and most reasonable explanation for the cult (especially for the cult's staying power through persecution &amp; death) is that the guy actually lived. 

2) Correct, although he overstates. The first gospel accounts stem from the 70's, or a little over 40 years after his death (and those are likely heavily based on earlier documents that were not narrative in nature). Most scholars do not believe the gospels are an attempt to present a historical eyewitness, so I agree with his main point here (I just disagree with his take on the meaning). We do have letters that seem to come from the 40's or 50's. I try to educate my community about these issues, pointing out discrepancies when they are not obvious.

3) If you read the _whole_ story that is the ""capper"" on this point, you'll notice that Mark presents Jesus as being bested by this particular woman, who is held up as a hero. Jesus then helps her out (and seems to have a personal re-orientation). The author also ignores numerous quotes about the apostles going out into the world; I understand an argument that they may not be genuine, but how can this author make claims about Jesus' racism based on the text but exclude the text that works against his point? This to me seems his only truly disingenuous position. I'm not sure if he is trying to decieve, or just quit reading at Mark 7:27.

4) This is the point. And yes, the gospels (especially Matthew &amp; Mark) disagree on the relationship of Jesus to Jewish law. However, in the passages to which he refers, Jesus is outlining a new way of understanding family. (In what I have read, the use of ""woman"", which seems rude to us, was not considered rude but appropriate for the time - see John 19:26, or example.)

5) Of course there are. This is troubling if one is seeking historical verification. It is much less so if one is seeking a theological multi-logue. However, his point here is really well taken - many church-goers are misled by efforts to harmonize the gospels, which is a fruitless (and I believe spiritually counterproductive) effort. It's also a lie. That's why I teach in my church (esp. to the youth) that the gospels do not agree with each other, and that if we are looking for a history text, we should look elsewhere. We had an Easter sermon one year which went through the resurrection discrepancies. 

6) This is inaccurate, but understandable. Mark's first reason for Jesus' death is that the religious and civil leaders hated him (Mark 3:6). The real issue, though, is that any theological reading of the text imports our theological categories. Substitutional atonement as we understand it is not supported directly by the Biblical text, at least not in a way that is exclusive of other understandings. There are multiple views of the cross in the text, just as there have always been multiple views of the cross in Christendom. Even when Christians confess that in some way, Christ's death and resurrection frees us, there is often little agreement on how. Where we read atonement for sin, the early church read Christus Victor. 

7) He starts to make a good point - Matthew 5:18. However, the canon expects us to read 5:18 in light of 5:20 (that is, the law is superceded by a higher righteousness, such as ""love your enemy"") and Paul in light of James (that is, we read faith not as ""belief"", but as trust and faithfulness - consistent with the Roman construct of faith). The faith v works issue relies on a very limited and decontextualized understanding of faith. However, I think - in no small part due to Luther - that his point is well taken that this is not stressed enough in the Christian community, especially in the evangelical community. I think there is a more even-handed critique than the one he presents, however.

8) 36 times is quite a bit more than I remember, but the main point here is accurate (although I disagree with the emotional editorial at the end here). That's why, when we hit verses such as this in a group, I make sure we understand what the text is saying &amp; don't try to whitewash it. Did Jesus really think this? Did the authors put these words on Jesus lips? What do we think this means as people of faith? I find those to be very interesting questions.

10) Mark 15:34 is one of my favorite verses in the Bible, along with 15:39 (which should be read through the lens of the imperial cult, I think). Personally, I think Jesus might have been surprised that he was killed; in the OT, God's prophets often suffered, but were usually pulled to safety right before the bitter end. However, as people thought and wrote more, they added their new understandings of Jesus as Christ- not just as Christ (messiah / anointed one), but as eternal archetypal Christ. So, we have a legacy of incarnational confusion between what we understand as essential divinity and what we understand as essential humanity, a tension that I think is even shared among many atheists (I use a very very broad definition of divinity). Like many atheists, I believe that there is not quite as much division between the two as might be commonly articulated in religious circles. 

I think the author has some good points, and in my ministry I try to address many of them. However, I think he is also very, very fast and loose with his (in)accuracy, a sloppiness that I think is accepted by this group because many share his conclusions. In a way, he models many of the concerns we share about religious education.",1260821207,"(in what i have read, the use of ""woman"", which seems rude to us, was not considered rude but appropriate for the time - see john 19:26, or example.)","rude but appropriate","rude","but",FALSE,"rude but appropriate","appropriate",NA,NA,1

"c0fyllv","Japanese people are not ""polite"" and French people are not ""rude"".  What is considered polite and rude is very cultural.  French people are actually, on the whole, remarkably concerned with protocol and politeness, and a big part of the reason that American and Japanese tourists get treated badly is because within the context of French culture their behavior *is* rude.

Americans think Japanese people are polite because most of the things that are considered rude in an American context are things the Japanese would never dream of doing.  That doesn't mean that within a Japanese cultural context, which after all is the appropriate one to go by if you're in Japan, that Japanese people are not rude.  Japanese people can be fantastically rude, but they do it within the context of their cultural norms.  They can be particularly rude to non-Japanese, and Westerners in particular are simply oblivious in my experience, which generally constitutes an even more serious loss of face for the person being insulted.

In general, if a French person is behaving in a manner that you consider rude, there are two possibilities:

1. The most likely explanation is that their notion of what constitutes rude behavior is different from yours.  For example, Americans generally feel that being friendly is the same as being polite.  This is not wrong *per se*, it's just how American people view politeness norms and so really only valid if you're in the US.  Americans smile and try to be familiar and friendly.  French people hate this.  French has a T-V distinction and a large part of being polite is addressing people properly.  In general, using people's first names if you don't know them or not greeting them or not saying please and thank you are far bigger gaffs that not smiling or being curt.  Moral: don't judge what's polite based on your idea of what politeness is when you're traveling.  Politeness is a social thing, and varies from place to place (majorly -- check out the dirty looks you'll get from Russians if you even inadvertently show them the soles of your feet).

2. You've done something rude (see above for examples).  You probably didn't mean it, but the French person you're talking to likely doesn't know anymore about your culture's notion of politeness than you do his, and you're in *his* country.  So you behave accordingly.

I guess it's possible that he's actually being rude, but I didn't list that because in my experience 99% of the time that's not the case (just as 99% of the time, the American is not trying to be rude, nor the Japanese person, etc -- most people are decent, no matter where they're from.)",1258562899,"what is considered polite and rude is very cultural.","polite and rude","rude",NA,FALSE,"polite and rude","polite",NA,NA,0

Studies of humans and other animals have shown this, given certain tasks women perform better than men and vice versa. Women, generally outperform men in multitasking and reading social situations. Men are generally better at focused and tunnel vision activities. There's good science behind these statements and there are studies to back it up. Men, incidentally, are generally better at staving off hunger.

There are 78 specific genes differentiating men and women. To disregard them in terms of behaviour is foolish. I'm not saying they can't be overidden through social conditioning, or that they are absolute, they do lead to statistical behavioural differences though. It's hard to condition someone, a woman, to not feel the effects of having far more pain receptors than someone else, a man, though. I hate to have to point out these scientific facts to you but they're there. 

Now, I don't think any of this deserves consideration in order to prohibit anyone from doing or being anything they want. I'm merely pointing out that the differences exist and they have their effects on our societies and need to be considered. I am not a sexist!

This is all particularly pertinent in context. A group of women are better suited to supporting female victims of male violence. I'm not going to retract that. My resolve on it is only strengthened.

"c08n90r","A bonus per each child? Please tell me more. As I understand it, they give more money to households with more mouths to feed. This is not just targeted at women. A household with four members having the same income as someone with three will always get more money, even if the four consists of a married couple and two children. Also, single fathers get the same benefits as single mothers, if they make the same amount of money. Lumping all food stamp recipients into the category of women who pump out children with abandon is not only rude, but unfounded. Furthermore, being on food stamps is no walk in the park.

Sarcasm is rude and aggressive, but it's not a personal attack except possibly by implication. You could make an argument that I was trying to imply that cycle2 is stupid because he failed to notice that some people will decide to install Linux after making their purchasing decision. I wasn't trying to do that, just employ some sarcasm to make my comment funnier.

A personal attack is statement that there is something wrong with a person. ""You are stupid"" is almost certainly a personal attack, but ""You have an IQ of 70"" may not be, e.g. when a psychiatrist informs a patient of his test results.

*Ad hominem* is a logical fallacy involving a personal attack. Personal attacks aren't always an *ad hominem*; this is only the case when the attack is used in argument. Its basic form goes like so:

1. Alfred says this.
2. Alfred is stupid/a liar/an adulterer/something else unsavory.
3. Therefore, Alfred is wrong.

You can see this on Reddit when someone makes a comment like, ""Of course a *Java* programmer would prefer static typing."" I was rude, but I didn't make a personal attack on cycle2 so no *ad hominem* occurred. I could have made the following comment, which contains a personal attack, without employing *ad hominem*:

&gt; I know, anyone who buys a laptop and later wants to install Linux should buy another laptop.
&gt; 
&gt; You're stupid.

That's a pretty bad comment, and even if I thought cycle2 was stupid and wanted to tell the world, I probably would have phrased it differently.

&gt;Kitchen staffer #1(glasses)- ""Huh? What's this? There's a camera going round."" Other lady off camera- ""what's wrong?"" 3rd lady, laughing- ""hey- it's ok on a blue plate! (as if she's saying cameras are a blue plate special item, lol)""

&gt;Various staffers: ""huh? what's that?""

&gt;Off camera lady: ""The customer's inside? Who's (is) this?"" Lady holding plate, setting it down: ""There's a camera here someone may have forgotten! (she's being nice but stern about it, clearly irked)""

&gt;The first lady (in glasses)- ""Yeah, that's it, they've forgotten it... (sounding concerned)"" Walking away, holding camera on plate: ""It's not raw (unintellegable). Coffee jelly for (customer) #30!""

&gt;Older lady's voice off camera again: ""It still hasn't come (a response from the front staff[?])"" Lady holding plate: ""(I) haven't said anything (to them/anyone)"" Young girl- ""Really?"" Camera plate holding lady: ""Yeah"" Older lady in background: ""Put it back/out (the camera) this time- it's a mistake! (young girl laughing at that)""

&gt;Walking with plate- ""Coffee jelly for #30!"" RINGS BELL: ""We're in trouble."" Sushi chefs come. Lady: ""This was going around and taking video..."" Sushi chef- ""Ah, this, it's probably a customer's. Umm, it's a foreigner."" Lady- ""they put it out (on here)?"" Chef- ""Yeah, they tried putting it out, to take (a video). Of the, er, of the scenery.""
