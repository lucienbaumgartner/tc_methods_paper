"g34uyr8","&gt;No, you're talking about a ponzi scheme. A pyramid scheme is where people who were in longer get paid by people who joined more recently. And once not enough people join, the structure comes under stress. It perfectly described our retirement system.

The difference is trivial, only based on who brings on the new entrants: https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piramidespel

Either way, neither is appropriate as a comparison, because either will need ever more victims at every step, until it can't get them, at which point the pyramid collapses. Repartition funding of pensions can continue indefinitely, and generation imbalances will cause a few percent of shortfalls of excess at worst (or we have bigger problems). Those can be solved without much problems by a small reduction in payout per person, or a larger topping off of the higher pensions. Or by modulating the pension age, something which should have happened a long time ago given our ever-increasing life expectancy. That is not a problem, that is normal. That's just payout measures, it's also possible to increase contributions or use alternative funding from taxes (which isn't that weird since the excess payments were also used for government expenses).

&gt;And you shouldn't invest money you can't miss in individual stocks. That's stupid and reckless. But you can invest it in index funds, sure they might temporarily go lower in a crisis, but most index funds already recovered quite well from March now. If index funds ever go to 0, then we have much bigger problems then being losing your investment.

It all depends on when you enter and exit, which may be right before or right after a stock collapse, so that effectively leaves your pension dependent on the whims of the market.

"g2jyrj0","Well, besides cases like the one of marauder ants producing small ""minor"" workers and giant  ""major"" ones, with the first being 1-2 millimiters long, while the second can reach the centimeters range, weighing up to 500 times the minors  -they employ the majors as ant carriers, as big food transport, as bulldozers and as tanks in battle- i was referring to *Acanthognathus* that makes colonies of just a few, very smart individuals.

"g2gmnqh","The TV show \`Puella Magi Madoka Magica\`. A dark twist on the magical girl genre, executed in the best way possible. Each episode gives you so much to think about and plenty going on that\`ll keep you excited. All the characters are fleshed out, with reasons behind every action they make, unique personalities and incredibly backstories. The shows main character is Madoka Kaname, an ordinary fourteen year-old girl who lives in the Town of Mitakihara with her loving family and friends. But one day, whilst shopping with one of her best friends Sayaka Miki she hears a voice calling her for help. She finds a magical creature named Kyubey, who is willing to make any wish come true: for a price. You must become a magical girl and slay witches in return. Sounds adorable, doesn't it? Yet, it soon becomes clear that this is more than wearing a cute costume whilst fighting evil: it\`s a matter of life or death...

**THE CAST**

**Madoka Kaname:** A normal fourteen year old girl. She is very shy, but incredibly kind and cares about everyone very much. She doesn\`t believe in herself very much, and is generally the one being saved, not the savior.

**Homura Akemi:** The mysterious transfer student. She is very beautiful, smart and athletic butdistant and cold around everyone. She doesn\`t seem to care much for others except for one girl she will do *anything,* and I mean *ANYTHING* to protect... Madoka.

**Sayaka Miki:** Madoka\`s cheerful, tomboy best friend. She can be very stubborn and reckless but loves to help people, with plans to be an \`ally of justice\`. She\`s quick to argue with others, however she is incredibly loyal to those she loves and willing to do anything for others, even if that means putting herself in danger.

**Mami Tomoe:** An incredibly strong and fearless magical girl, that Madoka and Sayaka look up to. She excels in almost all areas of battle, however is also very kind. She treats it as her job to make sure everyone in Mitakihara is safe from witches.

**Kyoko Sakura**: A selfish and mean girl, with a traumatic past. She does everything for herself and only thinks of the reward she will get. She is tough, but has a secret nicer side. Kyoko also absolutely ***loves*** food.

"g20np3q","Personally, when it comes to changing a cold hearted character, it's usually the people they interact with or the events they become involved with. Self reflection in the face of defeat could also help.

For example, with his close ties to the demon, perhaps while fully demonized, Caleb recognizes the demon's brutality and comes to dislike it, learning to make better decisions. Or perhaps realize that he is on track to becoming just like the demons he wants to destroy.

He could also have a soft spot. Perhaps he saves a child from some demons and he becomes a father figure for the girl who is now an orphan. Having a similar experience, he comes to sympathize and ultimately curbs his blood lust.

Maybe he meets a fellow adventurer who had a similar upbringing who came out as heroic, but weak. A reckless but indomitable person who inspires Caleb. They become rivals out of different beliefs, but they wind up down the same path of heroism. Caleb becoming more tame and respectable, while the reckless adventurer becomes more skilled and reliable.

Of course, there's always the devastation route. Utterly destroy your character to the point where he has no hope but to rely on others. Maybe, broken and battered, he is found by some kind people. While at first he rejects them, he learns to accept their help because he has no choice. His wounds are too serious and need months to heal.

A separate concept, does the demon half, Libertas, also need to be deemed ""Worthy""? Perhaps the demon, after experiencing the peacefulness of human society, away from the fighting, starts to reflect on his past. Instead of revenge alone, he also strives to kill off the ruthless demons because he wants to protect peacefulness and life.

At the end of the day, the way Caleb and Libertas grew up, and how they core personalities are determines how they can go from unworthy to worthy. Their upbringing, nature, and the things they've been taught should reflect their actions. Based on the description, they both long for revenge, and while revenge can change a person, a long journey towards that goal will change their feelings.

"g20mx2j","Counter points (but mostly agreeing with you):


**Ned Stark:**

Agree that we never really saw enough of him to come to a conclusion on this. Even from what we know of Roberts Rebellion, we don't know of him doing of any particularly impressive battles. The North takes a while to mobilize, so the toughest battles happened while Robert was trying to survive waiting for Ned. My impression of Ned is that he's very well rounded, but not necessarily top tier in any individual category.


**Robb Stark:**

Robb did great for his age, but I think he gets too much individual credit. He gets credit for the Whispering Wood, and that's deserved. Tywin underestimated him and Jaime was arrogant and reckless, but Robb took advantages of those misperceptions and deserves credit for that. After that though, I give a lot of credit to the Blackfish and don't give Robb individual credit as a brilliant tactician.


**Tywin:**

He's gotta be in top consideration looking at his entire career. He was outmaneuvered by Robb, but also managed to turn around the war by adapting to the situation and making an alliance with The Reach. His failures are mostly due to nepotism. Jaime was beat because his scouting was poor and he was reckless. Stafford Lannister was also taken by surprise in the West. He also massively underestimated Robb. But considering that he does not know Robb at all, and a teenager is leading an army to try to save his dad, Tywins assessment is understandable.  Ultimately, in the series, Tywin excelled more at politics than commanding in the field, so I agree you can't pick him as the best.


**Randyll Tarly:**

We haven't seen enough direct evidence to really evaluate him. Maybe we'll see him against the Golden Company at some point.


**Robert Baratheon:**

I give him a similar situation to Robb. He was bold, fantastic in battle, inspired his army. But how much of the battle strategy should be directly attributed to him? Robert was a teenager, and his father figure Jon Arryn at his side the entire way. His biggest personal strength during his Rebellion was actually politics. He capitalized on Aerys's unpopularity, and held no personal grudges. Throughout the rebellion he turned enemies into friends and managed to turn the numerical advantage in his favor. Remarkable accomplishment, but not necessarily solely due to how he performed as a general.


**Stannis:**

I think Stannis has to be the answer. He's a miserable politician with no people skills. All of his successes are due to tactical mastery. He beat the Iron Fleet in their home territory. He sliced apart a huge (and undisciplined) wildling army North of the wall. Indications are that he's got some tricks up his sleeve for the Battle of Ice.  Even his biggest failure, the Battle of the Blackwater, would have been a remarkable accomplishment. He's attacking a fortified city across a body of water, and Tyrion's defense plan was fantastic and creative. Even so, if the army of the Reach had not blindsided him, the city would have fallen. Stannis is the best general, but he fails in other categories.


**Tyrion:**

I feel like Tyrion should be included as an honorable mention. He never commands an army, just city guard. But he's a student of history, understands his father's military tactics better than either of his siblings. With limited resources, a sister trying to backstab him at every step, and incompetent psycho boy king, he puts together an impressive defense of King's Landing. He also understands military tactics well enough to recognize the flaws in the Yunkai army, which will come into play at the start of Winds of Winter. Everyone else there thinks Meereen is doomed, but Tyrion can already envision how to beat Yunkai.

"fyj7l5k","This is a shit situation that no officer wants to be in. Period. Now that's not to say that Cooke didn't overreact at all, however to try to blame this entirely on the cops is ignorant and biased. Now of course I know I'm talking on the subreddit that hates all police without question, but logic and objective reasoning is essential if you want to be able to make any statement that carries weight. Any old person can say murdered by police and get a viral video out of it, but the only followers you have are anarchists, ACAB supporters, and idiots who don't fact check or use logical reasoning at all.

Objective reasonableness is the idea that you have to look at this from the cop's point of view. Right off the bat, they're skeptical, but they're ultimately there to investigate a potential domestic fight. And all of you who are all about your 40% statistic can hopefully understand that domestic abuse is what we call a bad thing. You knock on the door and announce yourself as law enforcement. A few moments later, a guy opens the door and you're about to talk to him. But then you notice there's a gun in his hand. Now obviously, right off the bat you're going to take out your own gun, because you have no idea why this guy has a gun. But while you're doing this, the guy is making sudden movements with said gun and yelling and the tension is rapidly building beyond a hundred, and suddenly, it's not so hard to believe that Cooke feared for his life. Was he reasonable in doing so? Well let's talk about that.

First off, let's talk about the purpose for a private citizen owning and carrying a gun. If you have a gun, you have it to protect yourself and others against someone who poses an immediate lethal threat to you or someone else. Intentionally seeking a fight against a dangerous person with a gun is not what your job is, that's what the police are supposed to do. Now, Arizona does have a SYG protection, however brandishing a firearm is just as illegal in Arizona as it is anywhere else. In other words, answering your door with a gun in hand isn't exactly legal. Maybe not explicitly illegal enough to be charged for it, but it's not the right or best course of action. It's irresponsible and reckless. Again, not to say that Cooke's discharge was not also reckless, but he wasn't the one who initiated the violence. If I knock on someone's door and they answer it holding a gun, I don't care who they are, I am running and not looking back. And I'm a white boy raised in the suburbs. Not a cop working a job where everyone hates you and wants you dead. But cops aren't supposed to do that. You don't want a police force that just takes off sprinting when they see a gun, that doesn't seem very protective. Answering your door while holding a gun is an irresponsible use of that gun. If you're really that afraid of what's out there, don't answer the door. Again, your job with a gun is to defend only, not seek a fight with dangerous people. Not to mention that the officers announced themselves as Phoenix police.

Now let's talk about what happened as soon as the gun was identified. It's clear that Whitaker instantly realized his fuckup when the cops started yelling hands and drew down. But instead of dropping the gun and putting his hands up, he holds onto the gun, and moves it out of sight. It's possible that he tries to set it on the ground, but by that point he had been deemed as a threat by Cooke. When someone is just holding a gun in a situation that doesn't appear to warrant it, a lot of people will assume the worst. [This case](https://www.cnn.com/2020/07/15/us/st-louis-attorney-missouri-governor-trump/index.html) is a perfect example. And these people watched the ""peaceful protesters"" tear their gate to shreds before pulling out their guns, yet everyone still assumed they had intentions beyond self-defense. So is it really that unreasonable to assume that someone who answers their door with a gun wants to hurt you? Ultimately, I think in today's atmosphere, Cooke will unfortunately be charged. And that sends a message to every cop: ""you're not allowed to shoot someone with a gun without giving them infinite opportunities to shoot you first."" More cops quit, and you're left only with the worse cops who have been shown they can get away with doing something wrong. And so you lose the non-brutal cops and are left with only the brutal assholes who don't give a shit. You lose cops like Ferragamo, because they are not willing to risk the livelihood of their families in the event they get confronted with a life or death choice. Cooke had only 2 seconds to run through pretty much all of that and make a moral decision that, if made wrong, could mean his or his partner's death. Doesn't matter if there was no threat, they didn't know that.

Ultimately, this is an irresponsible gun owner met with a no-chances cop. Two small problems combined to make a big problem. If you made it this far, congrats, it's a lot of words and a lot of complications that go into the decision. I'll be interested to see how this plays out in legal systems because if you're not biased, it's a hard decision to make. I hope that I was able to inform at least one person.

Mark Wahlberg is someone who didn't really deserve the forgiveness that was given to him for the number and severity of his crimes in his young past. He however was full of drug and violence problems from a young age, like 13 he was already addicted to cocaine, he was just a kid. I don't think it was entirely his fault. You only become that way through the influences around you. He needed better influences in his life and the people around him all failed him. It just got worse as he got older and he definitely didn't do his due time for the crimes he committed and was super lucky to have gotten off with so little. He himself has admitted that he was super lucky and didn't really deserve the second chances he was given, but all he can do is try to become a better person and try to pay back to society.

The Mark Wahlberg of today I believe is a pretty reformed guy. His current self is a good role model. He's a good father and his own Mark Wahlberg Foundation supports a lot of troubled youth that were in positions similar to his own at that age. He's even met with his past victims asking for forgiveness. The Vietnamese guy in question actually forgave him, expressing that Mark was young and reckless but forgave him stating people deserve second chances. If the victim can forgive him, I'm sure I can. I like his movies, and I haven't seen anything unforgivable from him since his reform. Someone like Chris Brown who time over time just continues to disappoints but just throws money and influence around can get cancelled for all I care.",1594689117,"the vietnamese guy in question actually forgave him, expressing that mark was young and reckless but forgave him stating people deserve second chances.","young and reckless","reckless",NA,FALSE,"young and reckless","young",NA,NA,0
"fxzghpq","Its Nekomaru's fault he died. Its not like he was killed he the crossfire, he literally stepped in front of an explosive. Thats like saying its Sonia's fault Hiyoko was dead.

Akane's whole character is shes the type that is obsessed with appearing strong, because her childhood was so bleak she had to just keep going. 

Its less she doesn't change and more she doesn't want to show any emotional weakness, asides the crippling stupidity. 

And its a killing game so being fueled by murders, a cotten haired nugget that decides to use bombs and try kill everyone, and 2 motives that would be most despairing for her, the despair disease which AI Junko would know making her cowardly and weak would be most effective on her and starvation which would likely be a strong reminder of her childhood of poverty(and likely sexual abuse too, eating may be a type of avoidance, similar but not exactly the same as a PTSD sufferer avoiding anything that reminds them of a truamatic incident(s)) which also is related to her being a gymnast as a way to get money to get herself and several younger siblings out of poverty, solo, and she doesnt even like the talent. 

She rarely breaks the facade of being tough. Clearly one is Nekomaru's death and she becomes obsessively more determined. Nagito likely goads her in chapter 5 resulting with her nearly strangling him to death until Chiaki intervenes and she admits she blacked out in a burst of anger. Theres also the clear attachment to Minimaru too. 

Its very impressive knowing shes also one of the few characters who aren't scared to challenge the masterminds of the killing games, others being Kyoko and Maki. Sure its dumb, but she is essentially a single  parent and may aswell have adopted her younger siblings and she has 11 other people who could be murdered at any time. Shes also has the willpower to keep pushing on despite any doubts she has, and also is doubtful of herself at times when she trusts her friend's logic over her gut that is often correct. She also only falls into despair with Sonia, Soda and Fuyuhiko at the very end when she learns she is a remnant of despair. 

Really the killing game tries to break her several times and nearly suceeds. The stress would also contribute. If her life is threatened and she challenges Monokuma despite being warned off the idea, well thats her own problem but it does show she refuses to back down. She becomes a bit calmer as the game progresses, but with cases like trying to kill Nagito, we don't know exactly wait was said and likely he could have said something about Nekomaru and gaslighted her or made a joke of his sacrifice. Sure its dumb and reckless, but Sonia risks some sort of punishment by trying to blow up the door to the final trial room, Hajime tries to enter the Final Dead Room and probably would have died or murdered Akane, Sonia or Chiaki if he suceeded, Gundham decides to make a suicide pact with Nekomaru knowing both of them probably will die, Twogami dies most likely saving Nagito, Nekomaru died for Akane of his own choice, Fuyuhiko wanted to kill Mahiru and Peko did it instead. Really the only non reckless ones are Chiaki, Ibuki, Hiyoko, Mahiru and Soda. 

Akane is meant to be the type that keeps it all to herself, but like Soda is a victim of her free time events having no relevance to main story aside from the references to being sexually abused often. The most significant thing for her is she is put through hell and defies all thats put against her with her friends help, and as a group they help her survive by protecting her from herself. The odd reciprocation of that is the weird ""super human"" senses she has that honestly I dont even know and have zero justification for that as how she has a pay back story wise. 

Though she is lucky her atheltic ability and chosen motives mean she would be a dumb choice to try murder. Though in grand scheme of it all AI Junko could have realised she would be easy to manipulate into getting her possesion plan to work, Soda and Sonia definetly weren't as smart as Hajime in the end, and she likely knew Fuyuhiko would want to be with Peko, so wanted Izuru and 4 gullible people to live. That could be a fair reason for why she lived, and also the character is meant to be a simple, feisty teenage girl, she makes for an uniteresting choice of victim when Twogami, Mahiru, Ibuki, Hiyoko, Nekomaru and Nagito make way better choices as victims than her(maybe killing her in chapter 3 works best and have Hiyoko live, but then Hiyoko is literally the same as Fuyuhiko and thats pretty boring)

And yea alot of what I said could be purely coincidental",1594684472,"sure its dumb and reckless, but sonia risks some sort of punishment by trying to blow up the door to the final trial room, hajime tries to enter the final dead room and probably would have died or murdered akane, sonia or chiaki if he suceeded, gundham decides to make a suicide pact with nekomaru knowing both of them probably will die, twogami dies most likely saving nagito, nekomaru died for akane of his own choice, fuyuhiko wanted to kill mahiru and peko did it instead.","dumb and reckless","reckless",NA,FALSE,"dumb and reckless","dumb",NA,NA,0

The two girls are actually at first running off the road but then at the last split second you can see them hesitate and they unfortunately jump back in the exact direction that he swerves. If they would’ve kept running in the original direction they were (and likely that he saw them running), he likely could’ve missed them all.

"fwuwk6j","I disagree with this whole heartedly. Watchmen deconstructed heroes by making them fat, awkward, psychotic, and silly. He's great at making it look cool but that almost defeats the purpose of those characters. As for BvS his take on Batman is cool and almost comic accurate. Almost. What makes Batman an interesting character is his unwillingness to kill for better or for worse. I understand he wanted to show a different take on it but I think he actually mishandled what could have been an amazing dynamic. If Superman was the first person Batman planned on killing then the entire story would have been elevated. As it is, his ruthlessness just makes him come across as a complete villain making Superman's justification for wanting to bring him in the only right choice. What made that dynamic work in TDKR is that Bruce only let the villains die of their own machinations. Even the infamous ""I believe you"" scene is only left to interpretation. At no point is it ever brought up that Batman killed anybody and even the Joker doesn't get killed by him. He just finished the job himself. So Batman got a war zone (Gotham) under control and the US government can't win theirs so they ask Superman to bring him in. Batman has literally raised an army of vigilantes and no power in Gotham is able to or is willing to stop him but he hasn't taken a life. He's been brutal and angry and reckless but he hasn't crossed that line and in doing so brought peace to the most corrupt city on Earth so we cheer for Batman when he fights Superman. In BvS Superman should have brought him in from the beginning. He's lost control and has just become another Joe Chill. When he decides not to kill Superman he still kills other goons. He hasn't learned not to kill again he just decided he wouldn't kill Clark. Sparing him is almost meaningless then.

"fwtmt57","My mother was a mask-wearer, but she took that as license to live her life like normally.  I'm sure she thought she stayed six feet away from others while she browsed Wal Mart and Target for toilet paper and any other little knick knacks she wanted at that moment, but I doubt it.  And as soon as the lockdown was lifted, her and my father (who wasn't a mask devoutee) went to restaurants and casinos and everything else.  They said they were concerned about the virus, but the concern wasn't enough to keep them home.

So now they are both sick from COVID.  My mother is in the hospital on oxygen now.  I won't be surprised if my father follows by the end of the week.  A couple of days ago, my mother told me that COVID is worse than what they have been saying.  She told me to just stay at home as much as possible because it was a living hell.  This from a woman who has lived through chronic pain ever since I've known here.  Yesterday my father asked my sister for help with writing his will.  He's in his mid 70s and this is the first time he's put pen to paper.  That tells me all I need to know about how awful he is feeling right now.

Leno absolutely got there first, had a handle and Maupay had the option of attempting to avoid him or allowing a collision to occur. He probably saw how close it was to forcing Leno into a handball out the box and let the collision occur, hitting Leno at the apex of his jump, completely screwing his trajectory and causing the injury.

"fsh0dne","I understand where you’re coming from, but I think it totally fits All Might’s character. Every time Midoriya does something reckless, either Gran Torino or All Might will comment on how he is just like All Might. All Might is reckless, impulsive, and a strong sense of justice. It totally makes sense that seeing the heroic(albeit reckless) action Midoriya did would inspire All Might to give him his power. 

Are there other people just as heroic as Midoriya? Probably, but Midoriya was the one who got lucky. Does it make more sense to give One For All to someone like Mirio? Yep. Mirio is already strong and just as heroic as Midoriya. But then there is no story to tell.  Also All Might didn’t know about being able to use powers of former users of One For All. Every criticism you made of All Might choosing Midoriya are criticisms made by other characters in the story like Sir Nighteye.

I agree with you that logically speaking there  are plenty of other candidates better than Midoriya. I also agree that All Might is shown to be incompetent and reckless.

"fse0vyw","&gt;level 4Itaney1 point · 4 hours agoI disagree with the notion that the parents are bound to keep their promise, since their promise was based on the premise of teaching their kid good habits i.e. saving money properly instead of gambling with it. The parents expected the savings to be standard — it was impossible for them to predict the possibility that their son might’ve gone to Vegas and turned 20k into 200k. Are they honor bound to keep their word and reward unsustainable behavior? 

Their promise was explicitly to 'match whatever he ended up with at graduation'. 

They should have worded their promise more carefully or restricted it to money earned through certain avenues. 

I agree 100% that OP's son's behavior was foolish and reckless, but that should not change the fact that they promised. Either they admit that they don't have enough money to fulfill their promise (OP just said he did), or cough up the cash.

&gt; What about if he started slinging crack? I just don’t see it. 

The law in most countries deems any contract or agreement null and void if the consideration (item of value) was obtained through illegal means.

Slinging crack is illegal.

Stock market speculating, though morally neutral but extremely stupid, foolish, and risky, is NOT illegal.

&gt; At the end of the day, humans are also animals. If you reward shitty behavior, that shitty behavior is going to be perpetuated. Just like when you throw a dog a snack when he sits to continue said behavior, humans, to some extent, are coded to repeat what they are rewarded for.

One of the things that separates us from animals is that we can actually make and keep promises. 

I think OP's son is more intelligent than a dog, and stock market speculating requires a series of actions that dogs are not intelligent enough to perform. If OP sits with his son and talks it over, his son will listen if he's got the character. 

I don't believe it is a question of intelligence or reward-behavior mechanism.

"fr9msk0","I think it's more mixed than that. I think some states are being a bit reckless, but other states are slowly reopening because we have genuinely accomplished a few things:

Testing has *greatly* increased. It shouldn't have taken so long, but we *are* finally at the point where we have more testing capacity than we're using in many parts of the country. So that greatly helps with keeping track of what's going on and allows a quicker response if we start to see a flare up again.

ICUs are no longer completely overwhelmed. Things are still bad, but *much* more manageable now than they were a month ago.

PPE shortage is slowly getting better. This is a *big* one because the highest priority for reopening has to be nonemergency procedures. Lots of people need surgery to drastically increase their quality of life and long term health even if they're not gonna die soon without it. So elective procedures are, in my mind, the highest priority for reopening. So it needs to happen as soon as PPE is more available. My state is still mostly on lockdown but we prioritized this and we've been open for elective procedures for weeks now.

Summer weather is likely to help a bit. It's not a panacea, but it will likely put a small dent in R0.

All-in-all, I think it *is* time for some careful reopening. We kind of threw the kitchen sink at the virus because things were very bad and we didn't have time to experiment. But in reality closing some things is more efficient at stopping the spread than others. Now we're past the spike and we need to start shifting into long-term management, so we're going to start experimenting, opening up one thing at a time and checking that we're still safe each time.

"fr8e0r3","Thank you for the reply. I have a hard time getting images to work on reddit, but I will take pictures of what is visible, and try to clarify on the other. 

Honestly in my initial post I think it is a mix, I did screw up my wording some, but some of the issues -are- that ridiculous. 

I will try to word the situation better in the meantime, but I will include pictures of the living room and the Venta-hood in the kitchen later.

On one Single Breaker:
7 standard outlets
1 outlet for a 220 Air Conditioner
1 Wall Heater
8 light switches. 

The wiring is conjoined inside of the walls somewhere so I don't know of a way to improve safety without an electrician taking out walls and doing a rewire. I was hoping since the last time I had to know/deal with anything like that, that a new double breaker type might have been made, because I know how dumb/dangerous it would be to move it to the types I am familiar with. 

Living Room:

Two light switches (one is for porch light, the other doesn't seem to go to anything).

2 Normal outlets, one arcs when something is plugged into it. The other has inconsistent power (i.e. a lamp constantly flickers) and the outlet was recently replaced properly).

1 outlet for a 220 Air Conditioner, I have never used it so I have no idea of its state.

The porch light works fine, idk about the 220 outlet, and I described the problems above with the standard outlets. Those and the mystery switch are on a single breaker.

In the kitchen, the venta-hood shares a single breaker with a standard outlet. There is a red wire going to each switch on the venta-hood (fan and light) and no other visible wires connected to it, so it was either screwed up with the wiring or they are buried in a cabinet or wall. The venta-hood is stuck in the ""on"" position for the fan, so if I want to use the outlet for my microwave &amp; can opener I have to listen to the fan the entire time. 

I generally just leave the breaker thrown unless I need to use the microwave. 

I am trying to figure out, since I cannot afford an electrician, what steps I can do to accomplish as much of the following as possible:

Not have the house burn down from the overloaded breaker (example 1).

Have one safely usable normal outlet and porch light in the living room (example 2).

Be able to use the outlet for the microwave/can opener without the venta-hood running nonstop (example 3). 

From what I know, there isn't a safe option for any of them, but my knowledge of electrical work in housing is 30 years outdated and my memory is hazy as hell.

I know how to safely cap or conjoin wires, and replace one screwed up light switch/outlet/single breaker/or double breaker properly and with a proper identical replacement.

What I do -not- know, is a safe way to legitimately fix examples 1 &amp; 3, and I am not confident in my knowledge for example 2. Because unless there is a compatible breaker to compensate, then it falls back to being necessary to have an electrician. 

What I am doing for safety at present is the kitchen breaker I mentioned is off, as is the one for the living room example.

For the breaker from example 1, I am only using three standard outlets and 1 light switch out of everything that is actually connected to the breaker, in hopes that falling well under 80% capacity in actual use will make up for the sheer number of circuits conjoined in the walls and tied to that single breaker.

I will take what pictures I feel would be useful later today, and sometime ASAP see if I can trace wiring for the house. Not for the purpose of doing something unsafe and reckless, but to understand for myself as much of the puzzle as I can. 

I will also be ragging the property owner more because they are going to presumably hire an electrician, but I want to understand what is/isn't doable, the actual situation, etc. in case he decides to hire the ""shade tree mechanic"" version of an electrician. No offense meant to those of that euphemism that are very knowledgeable and skilled. 

I have a carte blanche to do repair work or improvements as I see fit per a legally binding agreement, but if anything screws up I touch I am liable. So I have made a point of not doing so for anything more complicated than an outlet or a breaker replacement.

I used to think I could “discover myself” while in a relationship with him, so I paid this no mind and went to all the parties I wanted to, traveled when I could, hung out with friends, etc. It seemed like he was happy for me although kinda jealous he couldn’t do the same. I never felt like he resented me for this. I was so proud of myself for my individuality and grateful for the awesome person I was with.

Somewhere along this, I noticed I had changed and grown up a lot and he... hadn’t.  I brought my concerns to him and he said that he would find a job, move out from his mother’s house, be an adult with me, etc.

I was hopeful about this, but time passed and I didn’t see any advancement towards that goal. That last year, I mentally checked out of the relationship tbh.

Then I had coffee with one of my professors and I caught myself wondering if it was a date or not. I broke things with Mark (telling him the reason was “different stages in life” and not “I might fancy my professor).

Turns out it was a date, I entered a relationship with my professor and we started living together shortly after. I’ve been living with him ever since.

I think Mark needed our breakup to wake up. He did get a job but is still living with his mother. I miss our friendship and we sometimes catch up, but honestly I have the same feelings for him that I have for my brother.

I don’t regret it, I think i would have ended resenting him and his inability to grow the fuck up. We were on a breaking point.

I do regret shacking up with my professor so fast. He hates my cat and doesn’t like how I dress. I was just desperate to “be an adult”

"fqibcns","I'm not saying you aren't potentially correct, however your assumption that Delphi perp's actions were all unorganized and that there was so much evidence left behind seems contradictory of the fact that there is not even one person of interest at this present time.  

""…with the FBI's help, authorities had to admit: this was likely the rarest of crimes, an arbitrary double murder in broad daylight. Mary and Susanna had each been shot once in the head with a .22."" (p. 243, American Predator by M. Callahan on Israel Keyes)

""He liked national parks and loved naive and inexperienced rangers. He liked remote locations. He liked targeting pairs. He talked about staging bodies. He had spent hundreds of hours in the woods, utterly still, waiting for the perfect victims."" (p. 243, on Keyes)

""A few people, he said, were lingering around a Chevy Suburban right in front of Keyes' truck. Now he had to rely on Samantha's fear to paralyze her."" (p. 90, on Keyes)

""Other people? This was the sixth time Keyes mentioned potential witnesses…Brazen doesn't begin to described the guy, Payne thought."" (p. 97, on Keyes)

So… both Keyes and BG made decisions in their crime completions that were brazen and on the surface looked reckless.  Keyes made several mistakes despite his planning as well.  Potential mistakes like: being caught on video? Yes for both (Keyes was on surveillance but hood on, head down, lights off); run ins with potential witnesses? yes to both-Keyes had nearly 20 run ins with unknowing witnesses in the Samantha homicide, they just did not realize he was in the middle of a kidnapping (including two police officers in a vehicle right next to his at a stop light). 

Unorganized/Unplanned? Maybe in parts, but for both BG and Keyes. Keyes made plenty of mistakes as well despite how meticulous he was.  No one has caught BG, so he wasn't as reckless as we'd like to think.  He was bold and creating a challenge for himself to outsmart the police, IMO.

I'd be interested to see the sources of tangible evidence you're referring to though, as it's always possible to miss something. The video/audio have not proven to be great evidence right now, as they have led authorities to no conclusions and even changing their sketches (potentially making things more confusing).

So far, I've seen no evidence outside of LE's blanket reference to ""having lots of evidence"" (which I believe was just to scare BG into turning himself in which is a basic tactic used by police; or perhaps they have evidence of a potential M.O./signature behaviors, that are only useful if he is caught elsewhere and they find a pattern between the crimes) and the snapchat video/audio (with his head down and still not identifiable to secure any P.O.I.; Keyes wore a hoodie and walked head down in this manner when having to be in a surveillance camera if it couldn't be avoided).  

I understand where you are coming from, on the surface a dual victim homicide in daylight with potential witnesses nearby seems disorganized and reckless.  But I think it was a planned challenge to prove to himself he could outsmart anyone.  If he was truly unintelligent and fatally disorganized, he would be in jail already… no?

I love his fiery attitude, but also the moments when he opens up and really let's his feelings show. Also his fight in the YF-19 vs the YF-21 towards the end of Macross Plus was one of the best VF vs VF fights ever.

- You can’t force BioDad to social distance. Agreed he is being reckless and stupid but you can’t control him. At least he’s being honest about it.
- You can’t keep SK from BioDad. That is called parental alienation and if BioDad decided to kick up a legal fuss about it, your wife could lose custody.
- You can’t force BioDad to take the kid all week. If BioDad decided to kick up a legal fuss about this, she could also lose custody as she is showing she doesn’t want to parent.

... so basically, you have a contaminated kid...

I don’t really understand how both the BioDad and her parents have SK on the weekend. That part is unclear to me but it doesn’t sound like her parents are social distancing either.

And your wife? She, herself, is at a high risk of contracting the disease working in health care (even if she is in full gear).

They are all basically walking germs. The best way to protect you and the baby, IMO, is to isolate the two of you.

Maybe her parents can help school SK while she is at work since they don’t seem to be bothered by it all (which, again, I think is reckless but whatever).

As someone else mentioned here, Pisces can be kinda guarded because I think we know how emotional we are and how weird we come off to some people.

Pisces really do have an odd perspective and I think can tend to talk in circles. I think we also feel misunderstood a lot of the time, so we just kinda put on a poker face to cope and not confuse anyone/ourselves.

Impulsive and reckless sexual behavior is right in the DSM-5, it's just that impulsive and reckless behavior may manifest in non-sexual ways as well, so if someone isn't sexually reckless but has for example an eating disorder, they're not going to be ruled out for BPD.


&gt;As I've stated here in another comment, gaslighting/any form of manipulation, requires such a great amount of cognitive awareness that a pwBPD just doesn't have. 


[That's pure bullshit.](https://www.google.com/search?q=bpd+lying+gaslighting) It's practically their calling card.

&gt;There are two types of empathy: Cognitive empathy, where you can understand another person's thought process, and affective empathy, where you understand the feelings of others. PwBPD lack cognitive, not affective, empathy, and actually outperform neurotypicals on tests for identifying other people's emotions.

"flggdg3","Hello!! 

I just wanted to share the most romantic evening I've ever had. 

First, I'll give some background before I get yelled at about our current world situation. My ex-husband has been quarantined for 2 weeks &amp; hadn't seen the kids in over a month due to his job &amp; now ""social distancing"". The kids &amp; I had been home for also 2 weeks (now 3) so we agreed to have the kids go over to his place for a few days. Non of us has been outside or to a store. The gentleman I met a few days ago also has been at home quarantined for now 3 weeks. So, we aren't being reckless, but very cautious about our outdoor moves. 

Ok, so we didn't get to go to the drive in as we had planned because that weekend I kept my kids. We've been texting every single day since &amp; shared a lot about each other. Creepy enough, we have the same exact upbringing, childhood, school year stories, lifestyle. The stories may be a bit different but the way they unfold mirror each other so much it's insane. Like, as hes talking I'm like ""but are you me?"" Anyways, that's been going good but we were really looking forward to seeing each other. 

When my exhusband proposed to see the kids &amp; figured it was a good time to see him again. I asked him if he'd like to come early yesterday so we could spend the day together. He was so excited. He arrived around 10ish. I am working from home so he kept me company while I answered emails &amp; finished a few projects. We laughed so much &amp; shared about our crazy past few days in confinement. 

When I felt satisfied with my days work, we ordered food which was delivered to my front door. We had a picnic in my living room. He had mentioned he'd been having trouble sleeping lately so I (as a mom I guess) asked if he wanted to watch something on the couch after we ate. I motioned for him to lay his head on my lap &amp; as I ran my fingers through his hair, he fell asleep for almost 3hrs. I happily was able to catch up to my show &amp; chat with my friends while he napped. 

After that, he thanked me a ton of times &amp; said my house just felt so peaceful to him. Afterwards we went for a walk around my neighborhood for about an hour. Talking &amp; laughing a lot. It was getting dark now &amp; my house was glowing with all the little dimmed lights that spread throughout the rooms &amp; music was playing. So we sat on the couch &amp; decided to answer about 400 questions I had found on pinterest. *We had played 21 questions on our first date &amp; he loved it &amp; asks me to ask him more.* Of course I love this because I'm so interested in him I want to know everything. He's an open book &amp; we got so emotional sharing some of the heavy questions. But then cry laughed at others. He was like half sitting half laying down &amp; I was laying on my stomach asking us the questions. He just stared at me the entire time &amp; played with my hair or rub my back. We were so close to each other it just felt so perfect. 

I did tell him before he came over that he had to leave around 10 so that I could sleep to work the next day. He completely understood &amp; was trying to keep us on schedule later that evening. The questions were over &amp; the time came for him to leave. We were sad as our city was going into official lockdown today &amp; we don't know when we can see each other again. He softly placed both hands on my cheeks after a random quick moment of silence &amp; kissed me. It was the most beautiful soft but passionate kiss I've ever hard. He hugged me tightly &amp; I didn't want to let go. And with that, he left into the night &amp; I immediately missed him the minute he walked out that door. 

He texted me when he arrived &amp; said *""I think you're my person.""* *""I think you're my person too.""*, I wrote back. 

I can't wait to see where this goes.

By comparing it to the flu he is creating this sort of expectation management. So when people start dying at higher rates he will say “so what, people die from the flu or other stuff.”

"flf3hrj","&gt; along with his complete in action on the situation made it much worse than it had to be.

Like Trump or not, this is just false. He initially brushed it off which was wrong, foolish, and reckless. But the US is absolutely taking action, much of this directly involving Trump.

In fact, I bet the US will perform better than Europe as a whole in regards to managing this virus when this is all said and done.

Reddit, as usual, is living in a bubble of delusion and is completely ignoring the massive shifts the US has taken to curb this and is fucking fixated on the initial slow start to testing.

We’re completely ignoring:

* The US was the first country to restrict flights from [China](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.nytimes.com/2020/01/31/business/china-travel-coronavirus.amp.html) in January and then later Europe (an action that all other countries soon followed).

* We implemented “[shelter in place ](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-stay-at-home-order.html) ” throughout much of the country, most notably Chicago, NYC, **all of California**, etc. We did this before the virus really took hold (arguably not NYC).

* The US has implemented widespread **FREE** testing across the country, even including [drive-thru](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.tomsguide.com/amp/news/drive-through-coronavirus-testing-locations-where-to-go-in-your-state)  testing. We had a slow start and we needed a rapid change. 

* Healthcare providers are [waiving co-pays](https://www.ahip.org/health-insurance-providers-respond-to-coronavirus-covid-19/)  for Coronavirus visits

*[FEMA](https://www.fema.gov)  is operating at a state level with federal funding.

* The US has shifted into “war mode” and are having Tesla and GM starting to manufacture [ventilators ](https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.usatoday.com/amp/2895190001) , empty hotels and cruise ships are being converted into [hospitals](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.washingtonpost.com/travel/2020/03/19/with-coronavirus-overwhelming-facilities-land-carnival-offers-its-cruise-ships-makeshift-hospitals/%3foutputType=amp) , and clothing manufacturers are creating [masks](https://www.google.com/amp/s/wwd.com/business-news/government-trade/face-masks-fashion-industry-coronavirus-1203544942/amp/) . It’s being orchestrated by the [US Army Corps of Engineers](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.latimes.com/politics/story/2020-03-20/u-s-military-can-help-in-responding-to-the-coronavirus-outbreak-within-limits%3f_amp=true) .

* Geographically and culturally, the US has advantages too. We’re much less densely populated barring specific areas such as NYC. We don’t rely as heavily on public transit and we don’t kiss each other on the cheek when we greet one another.

And this is just the moves taken to bolster our healthcare infrastructure. Here’s what we’re doing for the economic impact:

* Government has already implemented the [Coronavirus Response Act](https://www.fosterswift.com/communications-families-coronavirus-paid-sick-leave.html) which includes paid sick leave for people impacted.

* Americans will be receiving [checks](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.newsweek.com/most-americans-would-receive-1200-under-gop-plan-coronavirus-heres-how-much-you-could-get-1493337%3famp=1)  in the mail 

* Phase 3 of the Coronavirus Response Act is expected to be passed today or tomorrow which will include a massive **$1.5 TRILLION** stimulus plan to add liquidity to financial markets, float impacted businesses, and keep millions of Americans employed.

**This is going to be exactly like Bernie losing the Primaries and the UK December election** in the sense that Reddit is so certain about an outcome and then it turns out to be the exact opposite.

To really explain this for you:

You’re relying on a twist in semantics led by your support, rather than the actual rules

When we talk about initiating contact, we refer to whether the player slides directly into somebody, or whether their action results in a collision. Where it’s the latter, it’s a matter of subjectivity (as stated by the FA in respect of the incident yesterday), and is by no means a necessary foul. In your words, “its Sigurdsson moving into the space” occupied by Wan-Bissaka, and at no point do either of Wan-Bissaka’s feet go into Sigurdsson. His momentum, after his shot, takes him into Wan-Bissaka’s reckless but fortunate challenge 

Equally, for something to comprise a ‘trip’ there is again a reliance on the action (the kick or slide) being the direct causal link, rather than the marginally indirect causal link (I.e. we have two players respective momentums’ bringing them together, despite Wan-Bissaka very obviously being the instigator). This, again, means it was not deemed to be a foul

I appreciate the nuance is seemingly a very difficult thing to understand, but that’s football for you

Had, as you posit, the incident been a clear foul, the penalty would have been given. The incident was reviewed by VAR at the time and was not deemed to be such. For this to occur, you’d need (as I’ve stated about 20 times in this thread) either Sigurdsson to be impeded (e.g. he passed, or trapped the ball and so his action was interrupted) or Wan-Bissaka’s foot to have gone directly into Sigurdsson

Luke is impulsive, impatient, emotional and reckless, but brave and headstrong.  As he progresses, he becomes more patient, empathetic and a  and wise.  But even then, he doesn't lose his old character traits.  He can still be reckless, he is still rather emotional and he is still impulsive.  We see how he reacts in ROTJ when Vader taunts him by threatening Leia. Him refusing to join the Emperor doesn't mean that Luke had a complete personality transplant and turned into a serene godlike being who would never be quick to act or emotionally compromised ever again.",1583157806,"luke is impulsive, impatient, emotional and reckless, but brave and headstrong.","emotional and reckless","reckless",NA,FALSE,"emotional and reckless","emotional",NA,NA,0

"fhlxmf3","Back when I was 20 years old I made a series of bad decisions starting with a road trip to see my abusive ex boyfriend. While there I also gave into an old coke habit and spent 3 days high as a kite and drunk as a skunk. When I pulled into his driveway my fan belt snapped so I couldn’t leave. He took advantage of that and hurt me in a lot of ways, but also paid to fix my car completely. When I was on the 18 hour drive home, behind schedule so I was panicking, I was dangerous and reckless but I pulled myself together, until I pulled into a gas station and busted my tire. I got out and just started crying. I was still 8 hours from home, I was supposed to start a new job and I needed to get home. Of course another bad decision was going on a road trip not knowing if I had a spare or how to change a tire. So here I am just quietly sobbing at this rinkydink gas station in the middle of somewhere new Mexico when a guy pulls up and starts asking if I’m okay, if I have AAA and things like that. I was expecting him to hit on me or try to get something from me, but instead he called AAA for me and waited with me for help to arrive, and when he realized we were both driving back from the same place to the same place he told me that “something inside of him compelled him to help me” so he started changing my tire, only he’d hurt his back just days before. 

Suddenly out of nowhere a man in a yellow shirt covered in grime and dirt, I assumed he was a mechanic or something, walked up holding a 6 week old puppy which he hands to me to help cheer me up, and begins to help the other man change my tire. As conversation progressed we learned that the man with the puppy was in fact a hitch hiker and was headed in the opposite direction. I was broke and had nothing to give. The first guy to begin helping went into the gas station and bought the man days worth of food, and then offered to follow me back to my destination to ensure that my spare made it the extra 100 miles or so over its limit.

They saw a person who was clearly not well, and rather then turn away they helped how they could and went above and beyond any reasonable things they needed to do.

Or y'know, ""hey Finn we need to discuss as a leadership group what the camp rules are going to be, when are you free so we can have a chat because this needs established before you arrive?""



Because Finn clearly had issue with it, but didn't even get a courtesy call to discuss it or be aware of it before walking into the team. And honestly, he had a fair point. He's not in the same boat, the rest of the guys had their beers after their last games, days before Finn finished playing and they've been chilling at home the whole time too, no travel necessary. You're a complete tool if you believe this is okay behaviour for a group to behave. If he wasn't available or couldn't be reached, fair enough, you have to accept what the team decides. But that is not the case. They made a choice, conscious or otherwise, to exclude him.



And the fact you're ignoring the rest of my comment about how this is beyond this flash point of an incident not at all the root cause, suggests you can't think of a response to it. It's obviously way more than ""oh Finn's a prick who thinks he's better than everyone and has drinking issues"". Get your head out your arse or better yet, stick to your own team's affairs if you aren't willing to entertain the full story and realise even the journos who know and speak to Finn, know he's not some jumped up media whore seeking attention. He's got a genuine grievance or this wouldn't be happening.


He's pissed they chose to exclude him on something that concerns him, then make a public deal of it in front of the whole squad at the precise moment he learns he was not a part of the decision. Throw in the coach who doesn't listen and regularly conflicts with him, the deteriorating performances and results from late 2018 to the world cup, and its so easy to see why Russell got sick of it and chose to leave than put up with it. He knows the team can be better, I think most people believe that, but the way they're going about it, well it doesn't work. Typified perfectly when in the 79th minute on Saturday, a score behind, Ali Price elects to box kick, loses possession and we lose the game. Because that's what the coach wants him to do more of.

Boruto can be mature but its always written like an idealized version of maturity where the kid is more like a small adult it doesn't come off edgy because he always goes back to being immature and reckless but you get a weird inconsistent feeling.

(My opinion a 13 years can be definitely be mature but 
Boruto doesn't have a well of life experiences and hasn't had to live through the worst the world can offer he's smart but he shouldn't be as jaded as he sometimes comes off especially for a passive character.)


Himawari is a kid who still acts like a kid but still shows maturity. She desperately wants her Kyubi toy but in a sweet moment she reflects and gives it up and when she gets Shukaku she appreciates her father attempts and doesn't hold it against him. 

She captured the movie premise in one episode with a simple plot (yes I know there were more factors involved especially in the context of the anime but that's was the underline conflict it could also be said her not reacting to her birthday being ruined or  the broken vase  in comparison to Boruto's outrage could sway people more in the Hima camp but Boruto be overly protective of his sister could also be seen as a compelling character trait)

There's also the Biju aspect with her interaction with Shukaku and wanting to meet Karama it's a little bit of fanfic but the idea of her becoming a jinchurriki is a fun topic and while Boruto is basically destined to defeat the Otsutsuki. Hima's potential is unknown.

"fg0mbwh","I like the team as much as circumstances can allow. Centre options aplenty, right to play a working partnership though with Hastings as well having to step forward when otherwise would never have been the plan, and you have an entirely new duo to play off the bench if required or desired, plus Scott to come in later in the tournament if necessary as well. Harris dependable, if a little redundant on the bench imo with Hutchinson. Flexible options on the bench, but Harris really plays 13 or nowhere. 12 he's okay, wing he's had little impact I feel, Steyn out wide would've been my preferred choice, who also covers 13 and plays with Hastings and Johnson. But that's my opinion, not the coach's. 


I back Hastings. He's not Russell. He's at a much earlier stage of his career, but he's not really able to be much brighter than he's been tbh. Nobody can complain at all about how he's been at Glasgow, who remain a force with him pulling our strings minus one Finn Russell. He's a better athlete, plays without fear in defence, if a little reckless, but bigger lad than Finn and quicker too. He maybe doesn't pass as often as Finn, however, Finn averages 20 phases before a turnover. Adam averages 35 or thereabouts. He's more patient than Finn. Sure sometimes it means he won't try the mad shit, but actually that's no bad thing. It allows the team to build into offence, rather than maybe coughing up the ball when not necessary. 


But the serious issue is it's all about the pack getting Hastings and Price what they need. The pack needs to raise its game. Ritchie and Watson as a duo looks very exciting and breakdowns should be a very interesting aspect of the game as that's two aggressive breakdown operators plus Brown, Haining, I mean Bradbury, Thomson, Fagerson and Skinner (who's started playing 8 for Exeter so not a far cry to imagine Toonie giving that a shot some day) are all injured so it's him or Du Preez really, but I think Haining will want to prove himself and he's been good for Edinburgh, ferocious numbers every game so he's a worker and we need that vs Ireland. Think it says something that he's starting over Du Preez who's a regular for Worcester. Perhaps being better rested and less worn by a season will allow Haining to pull a massive performance out and surprise people. But not really the alternatives to do anything else so if it goes poorly, nothing to complain about imo. 


Locks look great. Gray and Cummings work really well together, gutted Jonny is leaving actually because the pair of them play off each other really well. Toolis is reliable, would have preferred Skinner or Richie Gray but again, nought to be done with injury. 


Front row looks worrisome, but Fagerson and Brown can raise their games on occasions, need them to do it. Sutherland I expect the unknown, but like Haining, he could come out swinging. Cockerill rightly has a fixation with Schoeman, but that doesn't mean Sutherland won't prove himself on Saturday. Dude had a fair amount of hype when he was younger, but injuries stole years from him, so maybe now comes time to reclaim lost time. Bench worries me, the individuals on the front row are capable of big performances. Berghan by many accounts has been good this season, Dell is a hope he'll play like he did in 2017 and before, McInally confidence inspiring to a degree but he's coming back from a bad window, so we'll see if it's affected him in any way. But Ireland's sheer depth on the front is ridiculously strong. We will see I guess. Could be a long day, could be a relatively insignificant element. The one positive I'll say for the front row as a whole is there's not one dead loose player among them. They'll all put in a shift, nobody is there who you have concerns won't be able to influence proceedings outside the scrums. Scrums are important no doubt, but it'll be nice to be able to play with a full set of athletes, rather than whatever Gordon Reid considered himself in the loose. 


Scrum halves finally exciting. Laidlaw will be missed, but if you want to play faster rugby, have more try scoring threat, we can do no better than Price and Horne. Price will be tested tactically whether he can control the game well, while Horne really just has to play his game, but speed is what we really want to see and they are really the key to Scotland having a chance tomorrow. We won't win the war of attrition I think, but off the back of speed and running threat, we might put the scares up them. 


Back three is pretty choice. Graham aside, we again can't really do much better I think. Until Duhan Van Der Merwe qualifies, we don't have much in the way of competition here. Steyn might come through to be in position but he's a utility than a dedicated back three slash winger so until he specialises and impresses in a game influencing manner, it's very much the Hogg, Darcy and Blair show out back moving forward, hopefully Duhan joins that list. 


Tagive I think is there for numbers and to be capped to aid Glasgow (and set up depth for future as we look bare bones when Maitland retires, as McGuigan will be getting on then too, as will Lee Jones if he's still playing, you need as much wider depth as possible), since he barely plays due to Pro14 foreign player restrictions. A cap would free Glasgow of that and enable us to field him in an ageing back three situation. Also he is a good player, it's just when you have Kebble, Seuili, Nakarawa, Matawalu, Van Der Merwe and other overseas options, you are gonna prioritise the pack over the wings and he loses out, then you have Van Der Merwe and Matawalu, senior players in the same position. Tough to break through with so little opportunity. Remember him scoring 2 tries on debut, after ages with the club then he barely featured again after that. Only this season he's gotten a fair run. Hell of a physical specimen. 


Really tough opening game, Finn may have eased fears had he been available, but really the missing figures here that stand out more than anywhere to me are Bradbury, Skinner, Gray and Thomson, a combination of which almost definitely would've been involved. It's the fight up front that'll prove most difficult and the game decider. We always lose to Ireland or Wales because our pack can't always compete for 80 minutes and as they know that, they play to that a lot. Biggest hopes are that their new lads aren't as ready as imagined, their old boys are slipping to age and the new coach lacks what Schmidt brought and struggles accordingly. I don't see it.... 

.... but this is the time of the chat where it doesn't matter what is said now. You back the team picked and we give the opposition as much hell as possible. Mon Scotland!

"ffxar6e","**General**

Can you edit your post and a synopsis? I've zero idea what is going on, where we might be going and whether I even want to continue reading... 

I am doing a crit because Miyar is whacky and I'm all about a mad character/unreliable narrator. I also love the setting/world that I can see taking shape. 

HOWEVER YOU NEED TO CHECK YOUR VERB TENSES. They jump all over the place. Get a book/software/something to help you with your grammar and punctuation. I've put in links below to some resources.

&amp;#x200B;

**The Positives**

You've got a really solid idea and what you've given us can be crafted into a strong hook for a novel. I am excited by the characters and the world. You have a strong voice but need to learn how to stick with it rather than fluttering into repetition and adverbial flights.

Keep going. You should be excited about your idea.

**To Improve**

Heighten the tension!!! Aside from the verbs, this would be my biggest critique. I was half expecting Miyar to be told he wasn't going to die (defeating his expectations) but he does die and then what? You do hint at it, but as you said in the post, the leader of the wolves almost doesn't make it. As your first chapter doesn't hit 2,000, I think you can afford a couple hundred words to build the wolf dude in earlier.

&amp;#x200B;

**Plot**

None.

I assume we now go back to the story of the leader of the wolves? You said in your post that you are introducing this character but we only get a couple of mentions at the end. Perhaps your mad minister can reflect on the wolves earlier? Express his distaste? 

At the moment, we are building up to Miyar's death and it happens within 2,000 words... Either we get a bigger pay off (though I enjoy the mirroring between the two executions, this could be teased out more) or the tension for the wolves section is teased out more.

The conflict between Miyar and wolves needs to be more central if you want us to reach the end of the third page and then keep reading.

This means FORESHADOWING the PAST (heheh).

&amp;#x200B;

**Pacing/Tone**

Good. Not really sure what to say here. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Voice/POV**

This would work sooooo much better in first person.

&amp;#x200B;

**Language**

I'm a little confused here. **Your imagery is strong**. I can easily picture the entire story in my head--yay! BUT you then have these huge slips where you are either trying too hard or being very lazy (see next comment). I think you would benefit from reading this out loud as quickly as possible. It helps to see where the flow breaks.

The first thing I noticed was that you used ""really"" twice within the first two paragraphs. I did a search and you use it a total of five times. I have a soft spot for adverbs (don't shoot me!) but HATE ""really"" in fiction. Really is lazy.   
Example:

&gt;It wasn't a very good saying really, and whatever original context in which they had used it, was now long forgotten. But it persisted throughout the ages, and had become a thing of tradition.

Could be: ""Miyar never thought it was a good saying. Perhaps because the original context was long forgotten. Still it persisted throughout the ages. A tradition for a people too stupid to remember why they started saying it in the first place. Miyar spat on the floor. What use was meaningless saying?""

""Craigs of Telmanar"" should be ""Crags of Telmanar"" unless there are a bunch of chaps called Craig from a place called Telmanar...

There is a lot of repetition (I've bolded as necessary): 

&gt;Lost **children** were told to listen to the stone. **Young lovers**, were told the same. That made for a lot of **lost children** and many **hopeless romantics** amongst the dwarves. **Hotheaded warriors**, **young maidens** and broken souls; they all would listen to the stone:

It could be: ""Amongst the dwarves there seemed to be an untold number of lost children, young lovers, hotheaded warriors, broken souls who were told to listen to the Stone. So many waiting for the stone to speak to them.""  
This eliminates repetition and keeps the tension which you lose when you say, ""That made for a lot of **lost children** and many **hopeless romantics** amongst the dwarves.""

You begin two paras in a row with ""And so""... 

""grating sound of boots marching"". Boots don't grate against anything.

""leaden halls""... just check your adjectives to make sure they are saying what you want. Leaden grates(hehe) here. Halls are lofty, cramped, oppressive, grand but unlikely to be leaden unless they are made of lead... which in your story might actually work really well.

""past the spires and the cobbled walls""... You cannot pass spires which is at the top of a tower, and walls can be cobbled together which is a verb but I would suggest you say a ""cobble wall"" (""cobbled courtyard"" is a different beast).

""He stopped to take a breath."" Did his guards let him stop?

""He was in bends now."" What on earth does this mean?

""It was cold stone, dark and damp. Good stone."" what is this referring to!?!?!?!?!?! Because it is a new para it could either refer The Voice of the Stone or the prison's granite wall... Next, no stone is better for the wear--though granite is a good choice because it is a hard stone. Tell me a bit more about the wall--is it rough-hewn? polished? scratched by prisoners?

**Punctuation/Grammar**

This needs a lot of work. I'd say try and fix this now rather than go back once you've finished the full draft. Try Grammarly--even the free version will pick up basic mistakes. It isn't perfect but it should help.

""When he had been young, and wild and reckless, Miyar looked down upon such people.""  
Should be either  ""When he had been young and wild and reckless, Miyar had looked down on such people,"" OR ""When young, wild, and reckless, Miyar looked down on such people."" I personally like the second edit because it is more immediate.  
The problem in this sentence is you switch verb tense (from past perfect to past tense) between the two clauses. [simple break down of verb tenses](https://www.grammarly.com/blog/verb-tenses/)  
You also write a list (""young, and wild and reckless"") but do not use commas correctly. I gave two possible solutions to this but the more traditional/obvious one is ""young, wild, and reckless.""

Another example:

""As the smith did say, the worth of a stone was judged by it's weight, just as the worth of a man was judged by his gestures.""  
Should be: ""The Smith said a stone's worth was judged by its weight; as man's worth was judged by his actions.""   
First off, ""it's"" is a contraction of ""it is,"" while ""its"" is the possessive. Also, ""gestures"" is a bit confusing while ""actions,"" though simpler, is pithier.

I think you have confused semicolons with colons...

"feud0i0","What would the purpose be of a longer sentence?

There was no intent to kill.  It was negligent, and perhaps reckless, but I'd also note that (from the sound of it) the only people killed were those who chose to ride with him.  I don't see why 9-18 years is an insufficient sentence for an accident leading to loss of life, even with the negligence involved.

What sentence would please you?  35 years?  70?  9 might be just a bit short, but you're still talking about 15% or more of somebody's adult life, and that's assuming they live an average number of years (I'd be unsurprised if a decade in prison correlated with a shorter life span).  A longer sentence than that won't bring anybody back from the dead.  And I'd say the deterrent value is minimal, if any.  So we're taking about pure retribution here, and at some point *as a society* we need to ask how much an extra ten or twelve years worth of it is really going to benefit...because we pay dearly for it.

Of course I'd see no issue with (after a decade in prison) forbidding him from every touching a car again.  And if we're talking about somebody with multiple previous convictions, that changes things as well.  But otherwise, it's arguable that a longer sentence in this situation would be fucking stupid, just in a different way.

"fea2dra","You realize there’s a lot of reasons a woman can become a single mom right? As I said at my job and where I grew up most kids were raised by single moms. However their dads aren’t all criminals. 
A lot of them are the products of puppy love relationships that didn’t work out and the kid is primarily raised by the mom. 
Others toxic adult LTRs that were playing house and didn’t work out where again the child goes with the mom. 
Then there’s some where the man was probably trapped or both people made a mistake/several mistakes while inebriated and now they have a kid(s) to raise who also are primarily with the mom. 
Men and women can exhibit a lot of behavior that is bad and reckless but not criminal. Like there’s kids whose dads are definitely commitment-phobes who are “allergic” to condoms. So they have a bunch of baby mamas. If

"fe95j2o","I'm not so sure about this one tbh since that can be very severe if the party doesn't have access to healing spells and whatever.  Obviously it depends on the level and the party but from my experience, my party REALLY needs their short rests, but that's not what you asked for help with xD.    


&gt;""The character recovers when resting at half the normal rate, gaining only half normal hit points from hit dice during a short rest, and requires 24 hours of rest to remove a step of exhaustion.""  


Obviously you could go with the ""voice in your head"" thing that a lot of games do. I'd personally not go down that road, the elemental needs to get home safely, and for that, it needs the pc, therefore it probably won't anger or antagonize the pc. You should have it act though when the character is doing something reckless but good, for instance, if he tries a suicide mission to let his friends survive or something of the sort. Elementals are primal beings, their instincts want them to survive and it'll probably do everything it can to not let the pc harm himself in any severe way.   


You could have it come as a voice of reason or advice, which would be cool and kinda a subversion of what would normally be pretty clearly a ""deal with the devil"". If you do that I'd recommend that if the pc responds well, engages and maybe even becomes ""friends"" with the spirit, the elemental might permanently restore his sight when eventually he learns the gate spell and leaves (this will also let the character not be blind xD)  


I would definitely do a few things with how the world reacts to this advancement. A ""lord of fire"" elemental spirit is probably fairly easy to mistake for a devil or a demon, and the church or some other organization might want to send assassins after him, or simply bar him from healing. Furthermore, maybe cults start getting interested in him, who knows he might become the source of reverence from a bunch of fire-crazed cultists, they might even try to convince him to join.",1578934446,"you should have it act though when the character is doing something reckless but good, for instance, if he tries a suicide mission to let his friends survive or something of the sort.","reckless but good","reckless","but",FALSE,"reckless but good","good",NA,NA,1

"fcsi781","I ran a hand along the boxes. ""You said something about Catan?"" I asked with a small hum, turning to stare at my close friend, Madeline. 

""Yeah! You *have* to try the game tonight."" She paused, searching my indifferent face. ""You are still hosting a party for New Year's Eve, right, Harper?""

I nodded absently. ""Game might. Mhm."" I pulled the game off the shelf, wincing at the price. 

I turned to her, about to complain about the cost, when I heard a name from the corner of the shop. They hosted a DnD campaign weekly, and I sometimes contemplated joining in. In the end, I always wimped out. I couldn't face anything related to fantasy without a fresh wave of sadness washing over me. 

""Ashera! What are you doing?"" someone yelled from the corner, obviously panicking. 

I was frozen in place. ""I need to use the bathroom,"" I announced, not waiting for Madeline to gripe. She still wanted to help me set up, and I only lived five minutes away. 

Instead, I quickly made my way to the corner, a hand held to my chest in anticipation. I didn't *want* to see what was happening, I *needed* to. 

A group of people, all around my age, sat around a table. They were laughing, joy in their eyes. 

""I can't believe you pulled that off,"" one wheezed, wiping tears away. ""Why did you think that was a good idea, anyway, Zaniniana?""

A fresh wave of nostalgia hit me. Zaniniana had been my gnome companion-wild, reckless, but courageous and kind. Ashera had been one of my other companions, and elven cleric that only healed if you asked nicely. 

The dungeonmaster, obvious from the folder set up in front of him, answered for the gnome. So she wasn't someone's character, but an extra? If fact, he also mentioned Ashera, speaking for her as well. Everyone else I had traveled with, all five of them, were mentioned by the DM. 

And then I was mentioned. A halfling ranger with the odd name of Harper, the apparent leader of the group, offered to show the group to an odd cave they had found, one I clearly remembered during our travels. We had never entered in fear of death, as rumor had it that a dragon resided inside. 

I found tears rolling down my cheek as I relived my memories, traumatic but beautiful. The dungeonmaster barely glanced over, then flinched, as if surprised. He stood, excusing himself from the group for a moment. 

""Are you OK? Do I need to call someone?"" he asked in a calm voice, eeirly similar to my dear dragonborn friend, Hiyax. 

I shook my head. ""It's just so wonderful. Did you make up those names?""

He nodded. ""Of course."" He licked his lips, Hiyax's tell when he lied. 

""I never was creative when coming up with names. Harper was always my name, you know? So, even as a halfling that had to act as if I was from that world, I stuck with a human name."" 

His eyes grew huge and he took a step back. ""What? No, that can't be right, I thought only I was from here.""

My mind momentarily flashed to when I figured out he was from here, right before he died. I had thought that I had gotten him truly killed, yet here he was.

"fabvn8h","I can see your point to an extent, and it's well writen! But I would be just a bit more nuanced (I was far too long so I wrote bold the main points). I partly agree in a sense that ***he certainly found a part of himself he wasn't aknowledging in the process***, while before teaming ith Walt he was a wasted potential. But ***the way he found it broke him in many and definitive ways***, so it's hard to think it was the only or best way for him to find this part of himself, or even if it was worth it. I'm hesitant.

**About his overall happyness at the end of the show:** I want to imagine Jesse finds peace, makes woodwork and maybe meet someone, but in real life, I don't know if you can go back to a normal life after all the traumas he went through (including near a year of slavery in conditions which have to seriously damage someone, I think his visible like invisible scars are permanent). Jesse is kind of a survivor, so maybe he'll find ressources in himself. But he has now to live on hide, has dark secrets he can't share (he's a murderer, no matter which dilemma brought him to be one, it's still something he won't erase), and he lost his two previous love parners that's not sure he'll be able to begin a new relation, especially if unable to share the story which built him. In El Camino, he's finally at peace but barely able to smile, compared to Badger and Skinny Pete (who were similar to his former self in a way) who are reckless but happy. ***Jesse's at peace but may be condemned to a life of loneliness he was despaired to end with Jane or Andrea***

**About his former self perspectives:**  His search of guidance was shown by his many attempts to find it in the person of Walt or Mike who both had a huge influence on him. That's why I think there was still hope too: he was 24 years old, begining his adult life, but still very immature (""*there's a cow house*"" etc), he ***looked like a blank page still waiting to be written***. For me that's due to his background: he was estranged from his parents since High School (Walt had his aunt's house registered on files), he graduated despite the abuse of weed, but lost his only guidance in the person of his aunt Ginny (after having handled her disease alone), I don't think the remaining estranged link he had with his parents then (who were still thinking of Presbytarian stages to handle addiction) was allowing any serious help or guidance for him (they probably just enabled him from time to time). As drugs are often involved in major griefs I think that his drug issue raised to involve meth only after Ginny's death, as he was let on his own in a hard time. I just think he never managed to get his shit together from this point, never attempted college or else, and wasted his potential this way, but he was still slightly trying (like his interview scene). ***Had he met the right influence (fall in love, start family, or else), I think there was room for self improvement***

**About his former level of addiction:** It got worse, starting heroin with Jane after Combo death, having major break down, etc. Before that his use was seeming to be occasionnal (for partying, or to cope with hard time).  Each time he has a break down, or something hard to deal with (ATM crush, Combo death, Jane death, Gale death, events post Drew Sharp death...) he copes with drugs (that's why I think meth started with Ginny death). If not for all this amount of shock, guilt and mourn, I think he would have keep a level of use similar to the one Badger or Skinny Pete. ***He is now a former heroin user (increasing his drug issue), but has hopefully defintely ended his use, so that's an improvement.***

**About his former level of crime:** At the begining of the show, he's been busted, and like Walt states himself ""DEA took your lab, your material, your partner, your money, you've nothing. Square one.""  He said to Walt that Emilio was his only contact and  he has no gun, he looks only at the artistic side of the cook as being himself a consumer. He's not really belonging to this meth business yet.  ***It's not sure he would have cooked meth ever again but may have done pseudo business (like with Badger) or other petty crime, so he improved.***

**What about the previous threat on his life:**  I'm not sure why you told Jesse was a narc, ***that's Krazy 8 who was the informant (not Jesse).*** Maybe BCS will explain better (as we know Saul got Emilio out of jail), but my take is that Krazy 8 snitched on his own cusin just to get rid of Jesse, as a meth head not fiting the gang life. Krazy 8 went mad only when Jesse told him he came to sell (while Krazy 8 thought Jesse was buyng ""*just shut up and give me the money*""). Emilio may have had his doubts about Jesse being an informant (as he didnt know it was Krazy 8) but he didn't know for sure, he wanted to off Jesse and Walt only once he recognized Walt as someone he previously saw with Hank and DEA (on his ride with Hank). Before that ***Jesse wasn't threatened (as long as he wasn't making a new meth alliance, but he had no contact for it), he's now hiding from police on new identity.***

"f9nudrd","**The difference I suppose, would be the method of gifting and how the mortal receives it. A Psyker following Tzeentch was already born with the potential needed to utilize the magic if The Warp, and rather than focusing on developing their own methods to kill and fight, they focus instead on stealing the energy from The Immaterium to do it for them. Further, the way the gods pass out their blessings would play a hand, with Tzeentch giving boons out according to his own plots and schemes, Slaanesh for its own amusement and pleasures, and Nurgle because he is generous with his gifts. Khorne isn't giving out straight up boosts unless it's been earned, atleast from what I've seen.**

**I'd also be willing to argue that most Khornates aren't getting much in the way of physical boosts anyway. Take Kharn, unless there is some new lore in The First Wall, I can't recall anything to suggest that his monstrous physical abilities come from Khornate Boons. I've always taken the seeming improvement in his abilities as more personal development, coming to embrace The Butcher's Nails and the Doom of The Twelfth Legion. It's like how Sigismund fights, where he is in a mental place where he doesn't even consider anything else, in a strange sense of zen. The Nails have always been advertised as rewiring the owner's brain to be 100% committed to the attack in battle. Now, a lot of people take this as being brain dead, and reckless, but on the other hand, it also shows that a Berserker is coming at you with everything he has. When someone like Kharn, after having fallen so far over the Heresy, gives in to The Nails, we can see him in a similar state as he was when he battled Erebus, no longer content to simply participate in the duel, but completely committed to winning it, and killing the Word Bearer.**

"f93q1c4","This isn't going to be in any particular order, so I'm sorry if it jumps around quite a bit timeline-wise. 

I started by sympathising with Sirius when the true course of events around James and Lily's deaths was unravelled. Revenge is never a good road to go down, but I understood the reasons he chose that path. He would have been full of grief and incandescent with rage at Pettigrew's betrayal. Whether he knew there was little chance of him being exonerated and Pettigrew implicated in the murder of the Potters, I can't say, but in the absence of that certainty, it's not surprising to me that he took that chance and tried to kill the guilty party. His excess of emotions in this is something I identify with to some degree; my emotions always bubble near the surface and I make decisions with my heart rather than my head more frequently than I should. 

I'm not saying he wasn't stupid, impulsive and reckless, but I understand him. 

I also can't possibly feel anything but sympathy for someone that was subjected to Azkaban. A soul-sucking place that drove so many people insane? God, even knowing he was able to escape the worst of the effects, I still feel like that must have been traumatic. The majority of his adult life was spent in a horrifying environment, deprived of most human contact and likely surrounded by the agents of the dark wizard he fought against... I feel like regressing to your teens is understandable in those circumstances. I get it. I feel a great deal for the situation he has been landed in.   

I will say I do not have a counter-argument for his bullying of Snape, especially in early life when it was purely picking on the unfortunate Slytherin kid that had a crush on James' crush. I can understand the outbursts of anger and fighting in Grimmauld Place because I'd probably respond similarly in his shoes, but equally, I can't reason away his dreadful treatment of Kreacher. I hate this aspect of Sirius's character, I just feel that's not enough to condemn him as a terrible person. 

My view of Sirius is less of a father figure and more of an older brother, I think. While he's fiercely loyal, he's still rash, impulsive, and ready for a fight. He tries to be supportive of Harry, but since he didn't finish his growth, he's still got that selfish edge that so many teenagers have, even if they don't admit it. I feel like if he had time and help to deal with his residual issues from the war and Azkaban, perhaps somewhere less oppressive and distressing for him than his mother's house, he would have eventually grown into something much better. 

But that's just me.

"f7b1uep","Valid points, actually. I have read some terrible examples of the genre but some traits are necessary for the story to actually get moving.

I actually set out to write against the tropes but I did it trying to show why the stereotypical behaviour was going to land the heroine in deep do-do. She still prevails, but she learns to overcome her lack of diplomacy and wisdom. Ironically, when I tried to write her as less reckless to begin with, the story got bogged down in interminable discussion and planning, so I had her be a little bit more bloody-minded for the good of the story. (Otherwise nothing would happen.) She ended up with the recklessness getting her into trouble and having to prick her antagonist's conscience to get out of certain death.

But I think the OP may be doing this not out of hatred for YA but from a love of showing the consequences of what other authors gloss over. I think the answer is to fill in the gaps in reality that people see in these characters. The girl can be mouthy and reckless, but gets herself in so deep she has to learn how to hold her tongue and go about things more carefully. She can have flaws; maybe there's some consequences for being rude to her superiors that actually come from a reasonable place rather than just 'help, the patriarchy is oppressing me'. Feminism could be in progress: she's not the only one who challenges patriarchal gender roles, but being a princess or whatever, she's in a good position to act as spokesperson, or even seen by the feminist movement as someone they need to influence.

"f6tgr2q","Rey is more like Anakin than the random Jedi. She has a lot of raw power, which is why luke refused to train her. He was scared of it. 

This will all make way more sense after tros, but I’m not going to be posting spoilers obviously.

Training is about honing the abilities you have, learning techniques etc. It’s like being lebron vs some random nba player. You can get by a lot more on your raw talent, but training will make you much stronger. Anakin was the same way. He went beyond his training he was arrogant and reckless, but it worked out because he was just that powerful.   

This whole thing about training is a complete misread of the force in general. It’s focused entirely on Jedi. You understand that people creatures and cultures all throughout the galaxy are force sensitive and have their own ways of communicating with and using the force? There are primitive beings that use the force, the witches of dathomir and so on. The force and how it is used is not limited to this narrow interpretation in Star Wars. 

Jedi are just a force based order that formalize the whole thing. The notion of using the force in a sort of raw way is pretty normal for Star Wars. Not everyone goes to force school to learn how to use the force. It’s not a requirement. That whole process is how you become a knight of the Jedi order. The force doesn’t only belong to the Jedi and it never has. 

Do I find this a particularly interesting decision to make for Rey? No. But it certainly makes sense. It’s not some huge gaping hole like a lot of people make it out to be.

"f6phiww","Yh, the Alxsie scene was definitely stupid. But you can't say quipping was out of his character, especially since 616 also did it when he was nervous. It's a coping mechanism. And the movie doesn't make him dumb, he created his own web shooters, learned to use a sewing machine to make a spandex uniform, and he was 2nd of his year. He wasn't dumb, just circumstancially dumb. That is bad, but that doesn't make his character stupid. And even if he did 'cool' things, it didn't make him a bad character. I just said that even beneath the cool demenoar, he was still a fool with a good heart. 

And why shouldn't he ask Gwen out? Why shouldn't he tell her his identity? Go back and watch ASM again, he was clearly a *LONER*, an outcast, and Gwen was the first person he felt like he could ever trust. Yes he was reckless, but most people who've spent years of minimal social interaction do tend to spill way too much information. He's had to deal with his Uncle's death, his alter ego, and problems at home all on his own, and I don't blame him for telling everything to the first person in what I imagine YEARS whom he believed to be a genuine friend.

And on Gwen: she didn't JUST help out. If it wasn't for her, the city would not have been saved. Peter was definitely smart enough find the lizard cure or make the electro-proof web shooters on his own, but you could clearly tell that he was pressed for time on BOTH occasions, and having Gwen help just made it a lot more effective to save everyone. And Gwen risking her life to help Peter actually makes her a better character imo, cuz it means that she's a good person with enough wit, courage and will that match that of Peter's, who is a good hero BECAUSE of those qualities. Both would risk their lives to save others. 

And just because Peter's 'cool' doesn't mean that he's not a Peter Parker. He still started out as an outcast, a loner, and he started out as Spider-Man for selfish reasons, but soon learned to take responsibility for his powers and actions. On the outside, he may not be your ideal Peter Parker. But on the inside, you surely can't deny that he tries to embody the 'great power, great responsibility' motto, perhaps the most important trait of the entire Spider-Man lore. Sure, he may have a lack of judgement, and character inconsistencies (god that Systevitch chase scene still pisses me off), but he tries his best to live up to his responsibilities, a lesson that Uncle Ben taught him. 

And on the parents part: go watch ASM 2 again. He deeply cares about his uncle and aunt's upbringing. (He said that to Aunt May when they were fighting over Peter finding the truth.) However, his parents' deaths were a bit more of a mystery than his Uncle's death. Disappearing vs shot to death. I'd say the former is definitely less solved than the latter. He's not disrespecting his uncle. He remained in his Spider-Man moniker BECAUSE of Ben and his teachings. It was just that his parents' deaths were things that had bugged him for YEARS, and was never solved. He just couldn't move on from that. Nor did he move on from Ben.

Discuss

Tier 1 : The people that main these characters will smash attack you like their life depends on it. In their brain, at night, they fall asleep while picturing the C stick. These reckless but ressourceful people find meaning in their life through simplicity. Why spam multiple buttons when you can only spam one ? When confronted upon their most inner desire to spam smash attacks, these often simple minded yet optimistic people will often reply that whatever works for you, works for you, and whenever it doesn't work, it's still worth a shot. These people have found their comfort zone in life, and they won't attempt to shed away from it. They are aware of other options but why even bother ?

Tier 2 : The people that main these characters makes decision in life through power. Multiple moves can kill at high percent, but these characters chooses to kill you with a smash attack. When they use a smash attack, you're meant to die. It's hatred directly chaneled into your hand motion, and the motion is often a quick, precise slap on the c stick. Boom. They land it, the opponent goes flying. Determination comes through and their resolve intensify. The further you stray away from their smash attack at kill percent, the more it becomes a desire for them to land it on you. It's like a game for psychopaths. It's a hunt, and when the predator smells blood in the water, you can be assured the smash attack it near. If they can't kill you, they will tunnel vision on this simple smash attack in a sea of kill moves, and their resolve will be tested. 

Tier 3 : The people that main these characters will smash attack you to send a message. Very often, these characters won't even touch the c stick other than for doing aerials. When the smash attack is coming, you can rest assured that they will charge it, and if you eat it in the face, their underwants WILL budge. A sight of gasp will be heard.

Tier 4 : The people that main these characters are extremely insecure and they don't want you to come close. Those characters will spam smash attacks as a ""get off me"" gesture.

If you asked them what goes on in their minds, they wouldn't know. It's instinct, the most primitive characteristic, that is kicking in, much like spotting a spider crawling on your back is fear inducing. For them, the consequence of spamming a smash attack is secondary to their own self security. It's self defense at it's purest form.

"f5j0g9f","To me, if the truck driver said he merged lanes because the car was changing lanes unsafely, then it sounds like the truck driver is pretty guilty. 

If the truck driver said he changed lanes because he was trying to avoid an obstacle in he road and he reacted in the moment by swerving into the left lane, then it’s more questionable as to whether he’s truly guilty of attempted murder or assault with a deadly weapon. It could possibly be negligence. 

The most important part is to figure out what his reasoning/intention was. That plays a large part into what the punishment should be.

From just a video you can never tel 100%. In fact, nothing is 100% but you try to get close to it as possible. What if the car driver knew the truck driver personally. What if the car driver had a major beef with him and threatened to kill him earlier that day. What if the truck driver argued self defense because he was scared the car driver was driving up to pull a gun on him.

"f54n166","#Aubreys got a good heart and bad behavior.

I have seen her in like four shows now so my opinion comes from over the last ten years. I learned on MBC her mother didn’t really love her; she was abused and neglected as a child. She’s got an issue where she wants attention and affection from women  because she missed that female connection in her early life. I think that’s her issue bc she talked about it on MBC with her short lil ex bf, Travis? I don’t know but he talks about her wanting to be friends with a woman and the woman loved her and showed her how to accept love from a woman and it was romantic but it was also motherly feeling for her and she didn’t know how to keep her boundaries. I think this was Coffey. Aubrey and Coffey were a mess on the show but I think Aubrey is smart enough to tell Coffey like, let’s have drama to stay relevant and keep things super will they or won’t they. I bet Aubrey told Coffey they would go right back to normal after the show because it’s not real life bla bla bla. I forgive her for what she did because at least she’s not lying to Coffey in that she can’t be monogamous with her. That’s hard to do to a person. Coffey is really cool. I hope she’s doing good. She comes from a sketchy background too, I bet. 


I am worried she’s having a mental health issue rn tbh. She doesn’t look right at the reunion. BDD or something she’s doing is making her sick. Aubrey defines herself by other people’s opinions of her. So she is messy but I think she really wants to be on some women’s empowerment and all that stuff because she wants to be close to women but she doesn’t know how. She wants to be this cool person, she just gets all excited and talks too much. She’s impulsive and reckless but sometimes we all need that crazy friend that pops off. Strong personalities need to be held down, she’s way more chill when you see her with a good partner. I think she was being extra because she felt insecure. Look how much older she was and look at her body compared to some of those girls. She’s talking cash shit about Beyoncé trying to create mystique. She’s using everything she’s got to try and stand out. And it made her look so thirsty and messy when she’s not normally like that.

"f3wknob","my first regret was to not lie to the police when I was 3 or 4yo.

&amp;#x200B;

 the issue arose from me finding a baseball and mitts in a closet and I asked my foster (shitty) father to play ball.

 I guess that pissed him off b/c he took me outside, and beamed me in the head with a fastball. Blacked out cold, and woke up to the neighbors standing over me and it was my first concussion.

&amp;#x200B;

 Later, my fucking shitty foster family mother/bitch coached me into saying it was an accident and they were great people, and if I were to say otherwise I would be sent to really bad people and to not say anything bad or else hell and brimstone, scaring a little kid for their own interests.

&amp;#x200B;

well, the police show up with some other old lady, only she has to hear it from me that I'm ok (with a fucking egg on my forehead), and I say I am. She isn't too happy and makes the foster parents give me a bedroom and make it nice, and she will be back to check on us.

&amp;#x200B;

 So, for a few months shit is actually pretty good. The old asshole/man paints a room and I feel better. The lady comes back and provides a few more requests and leaves.

&amp;#x200B;

 After that, it was neglect, resent and disdain every fucking day.  
I never did anything wrong but was punished every fucking week for nothing. Did tons of work, chores, and my rewards were threats or slaps or the belt for saying things like the canned food is shitty.

 Oh yeah, the best she could cook was literally heating up canned fucking food. Not a single thing could be cooked like my friends parents would do, no, we ate worse than homeless people. 

so, I would love to return to that time and say to the cops ""they want to kill me"" and with that huge knot in my forehead and being treated the way I was for just fucking asking to play fucking ball, they would've gone to jail or prison and I would've been back to a much safer state run facility.

&amp;#x200B;

I struggled with life, they made me work outside jobs since I was 12, and contribute to the shitty house, when I turned 16 they charged me rent and refused to sign anything to let me get a drivers license, even though I did everything myself.  


 My friends families and fathers raised me more than those fucking foster fucks did, and I will shit on their graves. Every time I think about them I think of how difficult they made my life on purpose. They deserve to be quartered a hundred times over.  


 after that, I made a few mistakes with bad friends, being stupid and reckless but otherwise I feel I made life as good as I can get it. Dealing with multiple head injuries and I have a short temper sometimes. Especially when I see someone bullying a little guy like I was.

First Mark wants his rights back: guns, liquor licenses, and also wants to be LAPD. I hadn't heard of the assaults before. Don't think he honestly cares about his name here, which is clear from his inability to seriously deal with his past. [Article](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2865445/Gunning-clean-record-Mark-Wahlberg-bids-criminal-record-wiped-reserve-police-officer.html) even states the reasons he wants the pardon.

Appears when this started, he was actually 15 years old (b. 1971) and possibly addicted to drugs. Initially, Wahlberg in 1986, threw rocks, yelled racial slurs, and made death threats towards very young innocent black children who were trying to go to school or otherwise enjoy their lives. Later, in 1988 at age 16 he pretty seriously injured a Vietnamese man with a stick while shouting racial slurs at him. That's abhorrent. Some huge issues with him? He could have admitted to his past racism, and come to terms with it, and additionally he could have dedicated a lot of his life to fighting racism and violence, doesn't look like he did that to me. As [@**YMBIBI**](https://twitter.com/YMBIBI)  so [eloquently says](https://twitter.com/YMBIBI/status/1005697747293523968):

&gt; Mark Wahlberg shouldn’t be given a pardon bc he is rich and famous. What  about those whose lives could actually be improved if they were granted  a pardon, people whose job prospects had suffered because of some minor conviction?

I happen to agree with her. Mark isn't deserving of a pardon. Looks like I agree with you here as well.

I know in our modern society, Mark reaching out to all of these victims and making amends could have been risky for him, especially if he had helped them financially. It could have seriously opened Wahlberg up to massive litigation. If Mark deserved a pardon, he'd have taken these risks.

If he couldn't get a hold of some people, or if some victims didn't want to speak to him, then Wahlberg could have been living an anti-racist lifestyle, reaching out for help in this endeavor to [those](https://blacklivesmatter.com/chapter/blm-boston/) in the [communities](https://www.facebook.com/VietAID/) he affected when he needed guidance. If ~~enlightened~~ Mark deserved a pardon, he'd have been living differently long ago. 

It does appear that the victim in the 1988 incident has forgiven him, but importantly did not know a thing about Wahlbergs fame, highlighting Mark's failures:

[Mark Wahlberg assault victim: Actor didn’t blind him, should get pardon](https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/gossip/la-et-mg-mark-wahlberg-assault-victim-speaks-out-pardon-20141211-story.html)

The victim continues, adding: 

&gt;“He was young and reckless but I forgive him now,” said Trinh, who did  not know his assailant wound up a famous movie star.   
&gt;  
&gt;“Everyone deserves  another chance.”

&amp;#x200B;

But I don't think his voice is the most important voice here. [Among others](https://www.pri.org/stories/2017-01-12/reconciliation-mark-wahlberg), the voice of Kristyn Atwood, who was a ten year old black girl at the time Mark and a group of young men and boys in their late teens physically attacked and verbally assaulted her, I think carries a lot of weight:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Both Wahlberg and his victims are dealing with the lingering impact.  One victim, Kristyn Atwood of Decatur, Georgia, a black woman who was  ten at the time, [told the Associated Press](http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/gossip/mark-wahlberg-victims-divided-pardon-request-article-1.2084797) in 2015 that she will never forgive him.  
&gt;  
&gt;**""I  don't really care who he is. It doesn't make him any exception,"" she  said. ""If you're a racist, you're always going to be a racist.""**

Some [context](https://www.pri.org/stories/2017-01-12/reconciliation-mark-wahlberg):

&gt;Wahlberg grew up in a tough, white working class part of Dorchester.  **Physical attacks on immigrants and African Americans were not uncommon  in the post-anti-school busing era.** Busing for the purpose of  desegregating schools began in 1974, but its effect lasted into the  1990s. When it began, white residents of Boston’s notoriously insular  neighborhoods tried to torpedo a judge's desegregation order by pelting  yellow buses carrying black kids with rocks. The conflict spilled over  to local beaches, night clubs and street corners. Latinos, Asians and  newly arrived Cape Verdeans were also among those targeted.

So basically, Mark was, at no fault of his own, indoctrinated as a child into the politics of hate, of racism, of violence. Nevertheless, he later became for a time a willing participant in racial violence, and then later complicit in the erasure of this crime by his silence. In all seriousness I'm with Kristyn and @YMBIBI: Until Mark Wahlberg admits he was a footsolider in the race wars in Boston in the 1980's, and essentially - that he was a racist - he can enjoy how we view him; as a racist. How can someone stop being racist if they never come to terms with their racism? 

Wahlberg can't have a gun or be a cop (and judging by his lack of critical work on his racism - shouldn't be); I'm sure he is loved, idolized, admired... by many, including those who do and do not know of his past. I think this probably speaks more to our acceptance of racism in society than anything else.

&amp;#x200B;

**Putting Mark Wahlberg aside completely:**

The rigid world you present is not as rigid as you'd like to believe.

You're representing pretty standard beliefs in our culture here, and it's not surprising that you're making assumptions about everyone based on those beliefs. There isn't anything you can necessarily convince me of here regarding how ""one action can define a life."" I know the way you believe exists. Those beliefs are what I was raised on, what I believed. There's more to life than that, and while ""one mistake can define your life"" in some regards, it mustn't always be this way. In any case: how one sector of society, or even many groups of people define a person, does not ultimately constitute that person. 

For myself, for the people I love, and really, for our society to function in a more just, healthy manner - restitution, growth, and forgiveness need to be  options if all parties are willing and able to reach this point. Really, if this is to happen, the onus is on the perpetrator in every case to define and live their life in a way that makes amends for their actions. However for this to be successful I think ultimately victims need much more support than they receive. Far too much importance is placed on retribution being a restorative act to a victim. I'm sure it can be in many cases, but it is simply not enough if we are going to reintegrate both victims and perpetrators back into society. 

Getting to the core of the issue: I'd agree with you in probably a lot of cases, that a person who did a wrong hasn't changed. I won't however, say that they *can't* change, or that they can't redefine their lives.

You'd first see him getting more and more reckless but that didn't necessarily make him bad - in the context of trying to protect the gang. He was always an opportunist but 'his people' were part of his opportunism and shared in it. 

A lot of people say strangling the guide in Guarma was his real turn towards 'evil', and it was, but I first got the feeling that he was irredeemable from Arthur's perspective when he started blatantly exploiting the natives and getting them into an impossible fight for his own benefit under the guise of being a rebel. That is honestly the scummiest thing I think any character really does in the entire story. It doesn't just fuck over one person like a lot of Arthur's actions - it destroys that entire tribe for pure short sighted opportunism.

"ezgnghz","It all depends on the reasons and process, and to some extent what kind of spell caster you employ, and (of course) what you mean by spell-casting. If your reasons are either a direct approach to Divinity or satisfaction of a healing motive, possibly in a very wide sense to include entertainment as a form of recreational healing, then the reasons are OK. 

The process is a different matter. As a general principle, the end does NOT justify the means. To walk outside of creation is at best dangerous, at worst not merely reckless but spiritually toxic to human beings. It should be done 'parsimoniously', that is rarely and with extreme care and in the context of canon law including the two Christian commandments relating to love of God and other beings. I take love of God to include love of the Divine Anima [Holy Spirit] that underlies Nature, and therefore love of the Divine Plan which includes respect for the principles and intrinsic 'naturalness' of Creation. 

Then there is the question of what you mean by 'spell-casting'? For the sake of argument, let's limit this to the purposeful invasion of space-time by super nature or other world entities, or the suspension of natural laws by speeding up, slowing down or reversing phenomena. This is a matter for your conscience, but the above comments relating to the loving commandments, parsimony and respect for nature should again be emphasised. 

Finally, the process and group membership of the spell-caster are obviously morally relevant. Evil methods do not justify a noble end. Wicca is a wide church, ranging from Gardnerians and Alexandrians to those few of us who follow a deliberately Christian path. It is unwise at best to employ a moral deviant, and in most cases would also be contrary to canon law. 

Those who practice magic may be OK provided that they do not do so by raising the dead, by blood rites, or other nefarious methods. The raising of demons is as a general rule unlawful, except under very extraordinary circumstances. Obviously a demonic pact is always unlawful. A final caution is against anything that diverts ultimate attention from the Divine, from Communion, or from both. The unity of Creation is also a basic consideration. That which introduces chaos or ugliness is obviously unattractive to Christian occultists.

If these considerations are borne in mind, then it is possible to request assistance of Christian mystics whose practices may include some form of what you would call 'magic'. This may either relate to a Christian version of Qabalah, or to more naturalistic practices of Wicca that do not offend against Christian parameters.",1567899014,"to walk outside of creation is at best dangerous, at worst not merely reckless but spiritually toxic to human beings.","reckless but spiritually","reckless","but",FALSE,"merely reckless but spiritually toxic","toxic","merely","spiritually",1
"ezeun4z","I'll start by saying I personally don't use alignment like D&amp;D uses it because it implies a moral structure that doesn't leave much room for morally grey issues, and instead I simply say that it should be more of a guideline as to how a character acts if a player chooses to refer to it. It certainly isn't an excuse for a character's actions.

That said, I believe that neutrality can be defined by the system as either someone who does not engage in certain moral dilemmas (such as your example if he hypothetically didn't know about the other people), or as someone who is selfish in their decision making. The difference I see between neutral and evil is that evil acts maliciously with the intent of being malicious, instead of acting maliciously based on selfish reasons. Homelander not only killed Madelyn just to foil Butcher, but actually puts the baby in harm's way, partly as a way of demonstrating Butcher's pathological and hypocritical drives, and partly because he's never liked the child. In fact, he chooses to save Butcher from the explosion instead of the baby, so that he can torture him with the knowledge that his entire reasoning is based on lies. That is most certainly evil.

Butcher, on the other hand, does not care about the collateral, but he isn't actively trying to cause it. He doesn't kill the maid, he doesn't even really intend to kill Madelyn, because he would die with her, defeating the entire purpose of trying to harm Homelander. What he wanted was a way to get Homelander to show some weakness that he could exploit to kill him and get his revenge. Homelander merely exposed that Butcher didn't actually have any leverage in the situation.

If Butcher were truly evil, I think the point he would have shown it was when they discover the babies being fed Compound-V. He uses a baby as a weapon for self defense, but whereas an evil person and hated supes might've killed the baby or something, he tells it he hopes it grows up to be better than other supes. There's a part of him that doesn't actually hate all supes, that wants them to be good, but he's possessed with the idea of getting revenge, and has had to justify it by blaming all superheroes (and to be fair, he's right in that almost all of them are hypocrites and taking advantage of their power). I think this and his other actions would put him firmly in the area of chaotic neutral, if perhaps dangerously close to murderhobo territory.  I think that his pathological  thinking makes him self-destructive and reckless, but it isn't fueled by a hunger for power or to do evil like Homelander. He's mentally consumed by his past, and that doesn't necessarily excuse all of the wrong things he's done, but I think he's more a victim of circumstance who's gone off the deep end rather than an actively malevolent force.",1567869061,"i think that his pathological  thinking makes him self-destructive and reckless, but it isn't fueled by a hunger for power or to do evil like homelander.","destructive and reckless","reckless",NA,FALSE,"destructive and reckless","destructive",NA,NA,0

&gt; “Beating our powers?  The agents?”

&gt; “Yeah,” I said, and my voice was quiet.

...

&gt; We have resources, we have contacts. How hard do we go after them?  How hard do we go after answers? Between the cases, the systems like Rain’s cluster or the Lady in Blue co-opting her cluster, all of that and the broken triggers… we might have to start paying attention to the elephant in the room.”

&gt; “The agents.”

&gt; I nodded.

And in 13.2:

&gt; It wasn’t much to go on, but we were dealing with monolithic forces hidden away in inaccessible locations.  They gave us power and they ruined us.  And whatever structure was there or wasn’t there, whatever organization was missing in how they balanced against one another, that power and that ruin was being doled out in disastrous proportions.  In broken triggers and in Dauntlesses.

&gt; With what Colt was saying, it was possible there was an area where the barrier between power and person wasn’t just thin, but was something we could get past, and that area was the unconscious dream.  That was our door to the machinery we wanted to operate, fix, or even dismantle.

Basically, my point is...Victoria would want to do this anyway, even if things weren't so bad. And she's not the person who would view the current especially shitty situation as a convenient excuse, but, whether she acknowledges it or not, it is *an* excuse for something she already wanted to do.

"ey3vevc","""if this isn't a red, i don't know what is"" or ""studs up omg"" are such dead arguments. I see it on almost any high tackle nowadays. Those words hold no value. Fact is, if you do a bicycle kick, both feet are off the ground and studs are up even beyond waist height. That doesn't mean you get a red card whenever you do a bicycle kick. If you control a ball high in mid-air with the opponent's face closeby, you get a yellow for dangerous play. Not a red. Even though studs are usually at face / neck height. All in all, reasoning that contact doesn't matter is simply not true. Now, you could argue here that he got lucky cause he was only a fraction early or he would've plummeted the Bournemoth player's leg with his studs up. But then I urge you to look at the full speed passage of play again. What I see there is just two players going for the ball. It didn't look like he was going to be late, and he would have hit the ball had the Bournemoth player not made that Abraham-esque attempt to still hit it. There was no way he was going to hit the Bournemoth player with his studs. That was clear to me (and I'm really sure also to the involved players) from the get-go, it is something instinctive as well to judge whether you can go for a hard challenge without being extremely dangerous- and that is in my view what both of them did here. Indeed, he didn't hit the Bournemoth player studs up. If you penalise this with a red, then any other foul that is less optically spectacular but still involves a leg (almost) hitting another player should already be a red, because usually it involves fractions of seconds or 'it couldve been really bad'.

"ewy2g7e","But this is the main problem with this matchup.

Goku is on a strong upward trajectory in power, it's the whole point of the character. At one point he's a little boy who struggles to beat earthlings, then an intergalactic warrior capable of destroying planets with minimal effort, now he's a multidimentional warrior approaching the power of literal gods, tomorrow? The time where Goku accomplishes a feat Superman has yet to do himself is inevitable. Every day Goku gets stronger and stronger, that's his whole purpose.

Superman's strength is fluid. It's whatever the writer needs to be. Yeah you can say ""Pre-Crisis was stronger because of this and that"" but it's only a narrative tool to Superman. In a single story you shift from Superman being able to survive a nuclear explosion, only later to get pummeled by Batman with Tazer-Fists. Superman's powers are a narrative tool to tell a story, Goku's powers are the motivation for a story.

=================

Consider a story from both perspectives.

Goku meets Superman, and he's mega strong. Goku naturally is excited by this and trains to surpass him. He fights a freeza here a cell there, slowly gaining power over the coarse of a season or arc or series, w/e. Eventually he and Superman have another sparring fight and Goku at the very least has significant progress, perhaps even stronger than him. They shake on it, Superman either congratulates Goku on his amazing progress or suggests a rematch once he's improved some. 

Now, imagine Superman meets Goku. An All-Powerful Man with God Powers, he seems irresponsible and reckless, but not a bad guy. But hold up, Goku's relationship with his wife and son aren't great. They've come to resent him for shirking his familial duties to only train. Superman takes it upon himself to talk it out with Goku and help him reconnect with his family. But Goku's only interested in sparring with Superman. Seeing that Goku obviously needs a lesson, but isn't sure how to reach him. Superman complies and gives Goku his fight, and they're evenly matched. Through some comments along the way Superman slowly starts to reach Goku. He mentions that he's only able to do the things he does because he spends time with his son. ""I learned that one from Jon..."" he'd say, slowly trying to convince Goku that perhaps spending time with his wife and kid might help him get stronger. Eventually Goku decides to do that, they hake on it, Superman either congratulates Goku on his amazing progress or suggests a rematch.

=================

Both are great characters, but I think once you're comparing Superman's strength to another characters, you're kind of missing the point. By simply listing his feats, there are good arguments for Superman not even being the strongest Earth-Based Hero, let alone DC, time and time again characters are compared to Superman, but in actuality Superman is however strong he needs to be which is always just enough to be impressive.

He shows dozens of different character traits over the run of the show/manga, most of them revolving around how he is an *open-minded individual that is accepting of others*. Just like how you can boil Naruto down to, ""Plucky"", theres much more than that. And of course, you hit the point where a person is so Kind/Plucky that *it does become a personality*. A person too nice to lay hard rules that he will enforce, leading to his own personal injury. A character too kind and open, thus inadvertently putting others in harms way. A person so open and understanding they are taken advantage of.

Besides, having a character you can empathize with and insert yourself to is narrative writing 101. Why do you think character creation is such a popular thing in games? One of the many reasons people decried voiced protagonists in Fo4?

Because most people *want* to self insert. Acting like its a detracting feature to any degree is ignoring a basic storytelling tool that is use in *nearly all forms of media*.

"etm5n9w","I have 10 year old malamute. This is just how they are. They are kinda like cats in that way. They want affection but they also want independence. They are kinds like a roommate. For ours we bonded on trick training and hiking. Malamutes are work dogs so giving them a job can do alot to improve their attitude towards you.

In terms of eating some puppies grow out of the eat everything phase once they are full grown. Some dont. Ours grew out of it and until he became diabetic he more or less grazed on his food. We would put it out but he would eat it throughout the day. Now we give him a mix of wet and dry food to entice him to eat all at once so we can give him insulin. 

Some ideas with your concerns  

1. Food aggression. This is easiest to deal with when young if they snap or growl take the food away make them sit and give it back after they calm down and listen. 

2. Treats or scratches. Not all dogs respond to pets or toys as rewards dogs are individuals and you have to tweak your expectations to that. One of my dogs is very food motivated, like your little guy, he could care less about pets or toys. That's okay! You dont have to move away from treats as a reward. You just have to move from always rewarding to sometime rewarding. So carry a small bag of training treats in your pocket when on walks or even around the house. Get the dog to do a command and at first reward for every trick every time followed by a verbal praise, that should be the same phrase, and a pet. After awhile move towards every other or every set of commands. Example: sit, lay, speak, then treat/praise. And switch up the order so they dont just run through the regular trick order. After that start rewarding them only occasionally with treats but evey time verbally praise and pet. After while you should only use treats during training sessions or on occasions when you need to get their attention immediately. This will take months to years to get him to a ""perfect"" state so dont be dismayed! Just be consistent. With dogs consistancy is key. 

3. The great outside! So outside time is something every dog needs and they can be understandably excited and hard to get their attention. Having a food motivated dog is in my opinion a god send because it's easy to get their attention with food. Now much like other training be consistent. How far can he walk from you, how can he react to other dogs or animals, is this different when he is on or off leash, in the back yard or at a dog park. Dogs are smart they will learn the rules are different if they are off leash, on leash, at a dog park, or at home. But once again consistency is key. You have to enforce the rules at each place consistently for the dog to understand. Much of outside training is reminding the dog they need to pay attention to you. So if he is growling to get something to chew on or ignoring you make him sit or lay down. Get their attention and get them to relax and focus on you. Once they have reward them with a treat. As a side note as well dont worry to much about not having their third vaccination yet. Dont be reckless, but most other pets will be vaccinated and just being outside, especially if the interaction with other dogs is limited, wont make your dog sick.

4. Potty training. This one can be difficult with some dogs. I found for me it worked best to find my dogs schedules, when do they normally have to pee or poo. When that time comes around take them out and walk them until they go. This SUCKS at first because you might take 30 minutes or more to get them to finally go. Once they start going say a command like go potty or w.e. then reward them when they are done. Then same as other training after a while the rewards can be less frequent or moved to just verbal praise. With occasional training to reinforce the command. Now another key is get enzymatic cleaner and clean the house spots very well. You dont want them to think oh there is pee here so it's ok if I pee here. If the peeing continues make sure your dog is not marking. This is different then house training as marking is more of a territorial dominance thing. It requires different approach to reinforce who is in charge. Often getting your dog fixed will also fix marking problems.",1562952571,"dont be reckless, but most other pets will be vaccinated and just being outside, especially if the interaction with other dogs is limited, wont make your dog sick.","reckless, but most","reckless","but",TRUE,"reckless , but most","most",NA,NA,1
"etapett","Well... Actually, there is one rule. I forgot about it because it's kinda basic, but it is a rule. My partner has to be wholeheartedly polyamorous too.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;If one of your partners had unprotected sex with five other people and then had unprotected sex with you without telling you they had unprotected sex with others, then this would not be breaking a relationship agreement with you? It wouldn't bother you? 

This is not something I've discussed with any of my partners, no, so I couldn't say any agreement was ever made. It is something that would bother me, though. I'd consider ending a relationship over this. I'd call it abusive and reckless. but I wouldn't consider it ""cheating"" specifically. It's not that I disagree with you that this is wrong or that you're wrong to want to try and stop this from happening. I just don't like the framing of ""cheating"", is all, and so I avoid it in my own relationships. I would prefer to address something like this through a moral framework rather than with the idea that it's simply breaking a pre-written agreement or contract.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;You're confusing self-hatred with being self-critical and self-aware. Polyamory is not perfect. Neither is monogamy. More people = more interpersonal drama... which is fine if you can handle it.   
&gt;  
&gt;People on this sub tend to have very different views about poly... divergent views lead to conflict and misunderstandings of boundaries and relationship agreements. 

Hmm... I would consider myself moderately self-aware and very self-critical. And yet, some of those comments still made me slightly uncomfortable with the self-hate vibes I got from them.

I suppose maybe my relationships are just different from the average poly person's though. Maybe I have different needs and a different way of looking at things that works for me. I suppose if someone ever asked me to follow certain rules as part of our relationship, I'd have to reconsider my position.

"eshoaia","\*\*\*SPOILERS\*\*\*

I run the adventure and it was a success. The scale seemed to be alright for 2 5th level characters except that you really need variety on the character traits and abilities. In this occasion the characters had come ahead of their performance troupe to explore the town before the main tents arrived. 

So, they were an illusionist bard and an acrobat (thief basically). The acrobat stealthily climbed everywhere and had almost always advantage for her sneak attack. That left our poor bard as the target of every enemy attack even though he only had a ranged weapon to defend himself with. But he managed to live long enough, sending enemies to sleep and viciously mocking those awake, while curing himself; to allow the acrobat to pick them one by one. Even the sheep hilariously killed a 1HP ape that startled it. 

The acrobat only received damage when the dragon breathed at her even though she still managed to avoid the worst of it. The bard used dispel magic on the dragon and turn it into a bed once he remembered he had that spell. I made a mistake when reading the spell description and allowed it, even though, as a level 3 shouldn't have been able to dispel a level 4 poly-morph. But it was a true heroic moment so it was worth it. 

Noke with 2 hp left turned himself into a mouther but with both characters attacking him from a good distance avoided the thing's effects and finished it off in a few boring but swift dice throwing rounds. Shinebright was turned to an elf again on the last charge of the wand by a reckless but lucky bard. And  finally, Guz, who had been tied up after the first encounter, was left locked in his room for the wizard to decide what to do with him.

All in all it was very enjoyable and for future reference the encounters  won't need to be modified for two resourceful 5 level characters until the very end when depending on the fight with the dragon the gibbering mouther might be too much.",1561997639,"shinebright was turned to an elf again on the last charge of the wand by a reckless but lucky bard.","reckless but lucky","reckless","but",FALSE,"reckless but lucky","lucky",NA,NA,1

"erpi6a9","Hey. Since I was lucky enough to get to read some of your other Jackson stories, I'm probably going to end up repeating points I've already made when giving feedback on those. Thought I'd give this one a shot anyway, hope you don't mind.

**General thoughts and your questions**

As usual, I really enjoyed this. Always fun to read about Jackson and his antics. I also think this segment has a good balance of plot progression, Jackson's family life and fantasy stuff.  

Your questions:

1) Absolutely, the tone is great. Humorous without being over the top, and the sharp transitions between mundane problems and action don't feel jarring. The post office scene was fine in my opinion. Rather than coming across as goofy, I was concerned for Jackson and wanted him to get his lucky penny without being arrested.

2) Yes, it's one of the stronger parts of these stories, as it should be with a first-person narrator. Like I've said before, I especially like how Jackson manages to be a bit ruthless and self-centered without crossing the line into unsympathetic.

3) No, I wouldn't say it feels meandering. I liked how we get a little bit of everything from the Jackson stories in this segment. I didn't find it aimless. Jackson has several clear problems and objectives to work on (the book, Christmas present for Ella, the main plot, dealing with the hex), and he chips away at all of them a little at a time, like you do in an episodic narrative.

**Prose**

On the whole pretty good, but another editing pass would probably take it up a notch. My main complain is the overuse of ""X was Y"" constructions. That's an evergreen issue around here, and an easy temptation to fall into. Not the end of the world, but I think you rely a bit too heavily on them.  

There's also some repetition, but it's better than the first segment you posted. A few examples:

&gt;It wasn’t really a sandwich, but I didn’t really care.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;I carefully stowed the screenplay  
&gt;  
&gt;With my dangerous cargo properly stowed

You also have a lot of paragraphs beginning with ""I verbed"". Not always easy to get around in first-person, but still something to be aware of.  

Again, though, your prose is pleasant to read most of the time.

**Plot**

This is a classic episodic structure, with several ongoing plot threads being resolved in small bites as we go along. The main plot has Jackson investigating the screenplay, and we get the dramatic part where he's almost killed (?) by a hex he carelessly uncovers. Another good example of Jackson being a bit reckless, but also competent enough to (somehow, just about) muddle through and survive the consequences. I liked the suddenness of the hex attack, and how we go from an everyday discussion about Christmas presents with the ex-wife to Jackson fighting for his life. One of my favorite things about urban fantasy is the juxtaposition of the mundane and the fantastic, and this was a well-done example.

Much of the focus in this segment is on the side plot with Jackson's family life, especially his relationship with his daughter. There was some good progression and insight into both his and Ella's prespectives on this, but I was left with one question after the post office scene. Instead of doing the elaborate scheme with the package, why couldn't Jackson just not send anything and later tell Andrea she gave him the wrong address? Wouldn't that get him the same result with less effort? Am I missing something obvious here?

**Characters**

I've already talked a bit about Jackson, so I'll just say once again that I really like his pragmatism. He's perfectly willing to scam the buyer of his book, and doesn't try to sugarcoat it or justify it in his internal dialogue. But he's not actively malicious about it either; he gets no pleasure from scamming someone out of their money. Finding that balance in a character like this and still making him come across as a genuinely sympathetic guy deep down isn't easy, but you did it well.

Ella comes across as a believable teenager. From just a few lines we get a good sense of the way she's navigating her relationships with both her stepdad and her father, and I liked how she acknowledged them both.  

We also have Andrea, who doesn't do all that much, and the people Jackson runs into at the post office. They were fine as far as extras go, and the lady's growing unease at Jackson's offer felt real.

**Dialogue**

Not going to say too much here. The characters felt distinct, and the dialogue was on point and believable.  

&gt;“Careful, Lenny,” I said. “I ain’t no rabbit.”  
&gt;  
&gt;“Let’s you and me go get some fresh air, hoss,” he said and half-shoved, half-dragged me toward the door.

This exchange is the only one I'm a little iffy about. Felt more like movie characters than real people talking, but I guess that might be intentional for this particular scene.

**Setting**

Pretty sparsely described, but I didn't mind. Maybe a few more lines for the post office. While I can see where the other commenter is coming from regarding Jackson's apartment, I assume you've already described that in the beginning. In any case, one of the advantages of writing something set in the real world is that you don't need to spend so much time describing everything since it should be easy for readers to fill in most of the gaps based on their own experiences. At least that's how I tend to think of it.

**Heart**

In the end this is a classic story of a working-class guy trying to make ends meet while dealing with the messy realities of modern family life. I'd say there's also an undercurrent of pragmatism vs idealism, and what you might call dabbling vs mastery. To try to explain that better, Jackson is kind a rough, partly self-taught occultist who doesn't seem to have the dedication to really dive deep into all the lore and master all the techniques, but he's clever enough to scrape by with bits and pieces he's picked up. Maybe ""generalist vs specialist"" would be a smoother way to put it. His professional life is the same way. If you wanted to be ungenerous, you could say he half-asses a lot of stuff in his life. On the other hand, that affords him a certain freedom the likes of Tim will never have.  

Finally, we also get a theme of suppressing unpleasant truths vs dealing with them, both for Jackson's life in general and with his criticism of Andrea's handling of one of their earlier adventures.

(First time I've tried including this heading, so hopefully it's not all nonsense)

**Summing up**

These stories might need a little tightening on the prose side sometimes, but they're still in better shape than a lot of the stuff I see posted here. The actual content is mostly great, a solid concept with good execution. The episodic, TV-like structure is refreshing and helps ensure any particular plot or character doesn't overstay its welcome. Not sure about traditional publishing (not that I have any experience with it), but I could definitely see this doing well as self-published Kindle books or something. I've seen people charge actual money for far worse. :)

So my physician actually told me that I was high risk because of my mental health disorder.

I feel like I am as sensitive as I was before “life toughened me up.”

I had done a ton of drugs that obviously effected my mindset.. and so that’s when I was diagnosed with “manic depression.”

But now I laugh at how “stupid” I was because yes... i’m still feel sad occasionally. But like you said, I have so much life a head of me!

"emanfnu","1. I hadn't thought of that. I think we know where all the stones were at that point too (Soul - on Vormir; Mind - New York; Time - New York; Reality - under a rock, super easy barely an inconvenience; Power - possibly the only issue, as they know it's on Morag but don't seem to know where on Morag, hence needing to wait for Quill to lead them to it). So it would've saved them the trip to Asgard at least.
2. But then you'd have to fight Thanos with the full gauntlet. No way anyone's walking away from that fight, except Thanos that is. Plus, you'd be creating another reality where half the universe is dead - you wouldn't get to save two realities, as we saw in the film.
3. Screwing with reality just so you can have your friend back is not only reckless, but selfish. Prime Natasha would still be dead.

"eiua63y","I've had a long day, and don't have energy to respond to all of your comments and questions right now.  So I'll start with just one -- whether Colborn could show malice -- since you acknowledge he has been defamed, but contend he must show malice to prevail.

You say:

&gt;What would be offered as proof to this effect short of an email or testimony confirming that the film makers were intent on defamation?

This isn't what malice means in this context. Certainly the defendants do not have to *know* they are defaming someone. Nor do they have to specifically intend harm.  As *Sullivan* makes clear, it is enough to show that defendants made statements that would cause harm, and were ""reckless"" with regard to whether they were true or false. 

Some people might say, ""what *statements* did the defendants make about Colborn""? But of course ""statements"" can include depictions, even pictures.  Defamation is not limited to spoken words.

Here, the filmmakers purported to present Colborn's in-court testimony, leading the viewer to believe it was being filmed exactly as it occurred.  Which was completely false. They re-arranged questions and answers, changed an answer, omitted some questions and answers, and inserted images of Colborn appearing to squirm and fidget with certain questions, and apparent ""reaction"" shots of people to his answers. All of these things, collectively, and in conjunction with other actions, were not only reckless but knowingly false. They *knew* what they were presenting as his testimony was not his testimony. They made no disclaimers, express or implied. 

Could their falsehoods be damaging?  That of course will be up to a jury to decide. The best way to judge, and what I assume will happen, will be for them to watch the ""press pool"" footage from the actual trial, and then watch the MaM version, and assess their own reactions. 

What we know now is that many, many people have commented on his ""suspicions testimony,"" how he was ""obviously"" looking at the car.  We know Zellner accused him of illegally discovering the car on the ASY after she watched the movie. 

I know that when I read his words in the transcript, they do not lead me to believe he was looking at the car. I have a different reaction watching the movie. For example, in his actual testimony, when he first asks dispatch to check the plate, he says ""see if it comes back to [inaudible]."" When we listen to a clear recording, he says something like ""that missing girl."" In the MaM version, this part of the recording is omitted, as if it were never there.

Certainly it is clear that in making the many changes to Colborn's testimony, the movie makers had *some* purpose, and it wasn't to save time. I personally think a comparison of the real video and the doctored video will make the purpose clear.  It was not innocent, or even negligent. It wasn't even reckless, but purposeful.

"eho8aht","Not...exactly. If you side with the Empire on Iokath, then the Empire might be in a slightly better place but not much, Acina is only one person, and the next-in-line after her is Darth Vowrawn, who is immensely fond of the old Sith-infighting politics much more than Acina's policy of unity.

Even Acina, when allied with the Alliance is not above breaking the peace treaty for a 'small transgression' by invading Iokath, an Alliance-territory. I hardly think that the Sith Empire had changed *that much* by then, Sith sentiments and old Imperial sentiments will still be in abundance, and *unless* there's a clear succession of powers, of people who follows and are dedicate to Acina's 'unity and strength' policy, the Empire will sooner fall to Sith infighting than the Republic. 

If the Alliance side with the Republic, it was shown explicitly that the Jedi on Ossus had created a technology that allowed them to farm in hostile places, in other words, the tech they created would save millions from starvation, it was explicitly laid out by Daerunn. Iokath is still a key point, remember that Scorpio is still uploaded onto Iokath, and depending on your choice in KoTET, she might be willing to aid the Alliance Commander. Hylo's letter had hinted that Iokath might be the last hope for a resource-diminishing galaxy and to hold onto it no matter what. I am pretty sure Scorpio is still somewhat relevant in future expansions.

In Vanilla, the JK, as Supreme Commander of the Jedi Forces on Corellia, and the JC, as Barsen'thor of the Jedi Order, lead their own armies to take back Corellia *and won*. While their Sith counterparts were engaged in Sith infighting, *not even trying to win the damn war*. 

I actually liked the idea of a third faction party where people of different allegiances, beliefs and races can gather and fight for a common purpose. I like KoTFE and KoTET, more of KoTFE than KoTET as the latter was rushed and heavily edited away from the writers' original plan. The Alliance is still powerful, they have jurisdiction over the rest of the Eternal Empire (Zakuul seceded, but they *too* absolve any claims on their former territories), they have the wealth from the Glided Star (depending on how you played it), they have legions of skytroopers and more importantly, they have *Iokath*.

Hylo had hinted that Iokath might be the answer to the galaxy's diminishing resources, in other words, if the Alliance sided with the Republic, its not unlikely for the Republic to have the odds with them. If you sided with the Republic on Iokath, the Supreme Commander remains as Jace Malcom, aka, the reckless but courageous ex-Havoc soldier who fought Malgus bare-handed. Satele Shan is still alive, regardless of what you choose, I have little doubt that she will appear again in future expansion, after all, Malgus is alive.

The Jedi might be scattered, but it was hinted if you play the Republic side on Ossus, that the Jedi did it to ensure their continual survival (Satele Shan was in contact with General Daerunn too). Now that they are resurfacing, it meant that the Jedi Order will eventually return. E.g. Satele Shan rediscovered Tython decades ago and settled the Jedi Order there after their Temple at Coruscant was destroyed. 

The difference between the empire and the republic is the latter are more likely to buckle down and unite for a common foe, even when there are corruption in the ranks and democracy *can* be inefficient. The empire is more efficient as they are an absolute monarchy, but likewise, Sith-infighting is still a factor, *centuries, no,* thousands of years of Sith traditions isn't going to disappear overnight. 

The empire is more efficient as they are an absolute monarchy, but at the same time, if Acina falls without a clear-line of succession, without *someone sharing the same goals* and ideals as she was taking the throne, the Empire is likely to return to its original roots (such as, open Sith infighting and all that jazz) even *if* the anti-alien sentiments had decreased significantly.

The republic is less efficient as they are a democracy, but at the same time, they have dozens of other senators keeping each other in line, and democracy may not be perfect, but at least they try to be, and they have laws keeping their most powerful people in check (the Siths, as far as I have seen, don't, killing servants in public is still a 'done thing' in the empire), and the republic had always been about unity and freedom, and well...the republic, before the empire managed to hold onto Makeb, was *losing the war* because of their internal issues.

"ef1uk9r","Medically, I know it's reckless and potentially dangerous. Fucking with homeostasis is a pretty big deal, and switching on and off dominant hormones isn't something that's been tested and acknowledged to be safe long-term. 

There's also the simple fact that you can't 'choose' changes. Some people luck out and get a deep voice. Some people just get massive downstairs growth and turn into Sasquatches. Some just develop BO and nothing else. No dose and no amount of time mitigates what your body does, apart from the speed of it. 

So absolutely, it's an immature and willfully ignorant thing to do - go on hormones of all things for a set period to get specific changes. 

But while I used to feel exactly this way, nowadays I'm not entirely sure it does a huge amount of damage to those of us who are binary, in this for the long haul, and doing it to mitigate crippling dysphoria. Thankfully the number of these people is not greater than ours by any stretch, they're just obnoxiously noisy and suck all the oxygen out of our discussions - it's unlikely they'll have a profound effect on how trans people are treated, other than perhaps more thorough/rigorous testing before issuing medication (gatekeeping - le gasp). Which, to be honest, won't affect most of us coming through, because they're testing for the things we actually have. 

There's also the reverse push coming from us. We can't underestimate our own voices, especially if they are calm and rational, calling for people to think a little more deeply about what it is they actually need, and furthering education on the ACTUAL effects of hormones (ie: back hair is a thing, and your voice will do what it pleases regardless of what you throw at it). It's also beneficial when we throw out other passing advice pre-T, so people who want to be more andro have more tools in their kit before resorting to hormones. If they knew about how effective voice coaching is, or that AFAB, oestrogen-dominant bodies CAN get those desired V-shaped torsos and big shoulders without hormones (protip: diet and lifting!), I reckon it would reduce the number of people jumping to the nuclear option when they don't actually need it. 

Ultimately it's their choice, even if it's a dumb choice. What we can do is offer them strong, reliable alternatives before they get that far, and offer sanity once they start and realise it ain't right. It feels weird because it's the opposite of what we are, but we're a big community with a lot of knowledge, and we can absolutely help people realise they're actually baby dykes or studs or that they can get their desired aesthetic with style choices, voice training and a barbell or two.

"ecuk0fb","[Anyone remember this thread from months ago?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Parahumans/comments/9h2kq5/what_would_armorfaces_prt_ratings_be/)

It's been a long time. I have thought a bit about Armourface and how he could be effective.

First he ditches the name Armourface, as awesome as that name is. It reveals way too much about how his power actually works. You never want a cape name that reveals your weakness. He chooses a generic brute name, like Anvil or Stalwart or something. Let's go with Anvil for now.

Anvil joins the protectorate. Because Anvil is a genuinely good person who wants to do good and is sane and intelligent enough to know the PRT is actually the best way to go about this. Anvil recieves PRT training and equipment because for the most part Anvil will be fighting like a PRT trooper with a lot of extra tricks up his sleeve.

Anvil's costume is modelled to have the exact same metallic scale pattern as his armoured face. Because that makes it impossible to tell where his power effect starts or ends, and because it's a good costume.

Anvil trains hard, and practices long and hard for any techniques using his armoured face.

He practices jumping and landing face first into pools, then into nets, then on solid ground, until he can safely jump off buildings. He can even jump from airplanes or safely be launched by other parahumans. He even has some aerodynamic fins on his costume to help him control his fall and land face first.

He practices moving and operating underwater, since his power lets him breathe underwater with no scuba gear. The same fins that help him control his descent help him swim and maneuver better in water.

Anvil learns mixed martial arts, but develops his own style with a huge focus on headbutting and absolutely no effort put into protecting his face. He practices intercepting projectiles of various speeds and sizes with his face, like a reverse game of dodgeball. Anvil practices breaking down doors with his face, stopping cars with his face, peaking out of cover, any other face-specific techniques he can think of.

Anvil uses a large variety of custom weapons and equipment to make up for his rather lackluster power. He switches up his loadout depending on who he's likely to go up against.

He often wears a pair of sound cancelling headphones with built in speakers, especially when going up against masters. That way he can still hear and communicate with teammates but he can't be affected by outside noises.

He makes very heavy use of grenades. Smoke, flashbang, tear gas, etc. He can pull the pins smoke or gas grenades while still wearing them, making it very difficult to aim at him and very unpleasant to be near him, almost like a poor man's Grue. He can use flashbangs at very close range with no worry. Of course his teammates are usually given gas masks, ear plugs, and tinted visors so they aren't hurt by his tactics.

He has a large bulletproof shield with a completely empty window to look through and a curved place to rest his forehead against. With this he can become an immovable (but not indestructible) wall. Very effective against weaker blasters or mundane firearms.

He has a few different face masks with hammerheads, axe blades, or spikes on them to focus the power of his headbutts into more powerful attacks. He even has some masks with built in shaped charge explosives, to act as a suicide bomber without the suicide part.

Anvil discovered one hidden, very effective use for his power: recoil elimination. If he attaches a custom strange looking face rest to any firearm he can use it with absolutely no recoil. He starts off using the same weapons as a normal PRT trooper just with better accuracy. Eventually though the protectorate makes a completely custom gun for him, more like a short cannon than a rifle. If anyone normal tried to fire it, it would send them flying backwards and break several of their bones. Anvil can use it just fine. The cannon can shoot many different types of shot (armour piercing, explosive, buckshot, non lethal rubber shot, containment foam, nets, gas, etc.). This gives him a lot of firepower and a lot of versatility. The size and weight of both the weapon and ammo is a bit of a problem so he often relies on PRT troopers to bring him spare ammo and help him reload faster.

One time another brute used Anvil as a battering ram. Against Leviathan. And sent Leviathan flying.

Anvil performs rather specialized roles in the Protectorate. He is often sent on strike teams against any masters and strangers that operate visually. Threats like the Mathers Fallen, the Undersiders, or Heartbreaker. He's also used against trumps who nullify or copy powers since they can't affect his face at all. He even went on one mission to infiltrate a villain's completely underwater base. He occasionally works with Watchdog mainly to see through illusions and verify other thinker's claims. Of course he still does routine patrols and protectorate business when he's not on mission.

He is considered an ideal candidate for a future leadership position because of his general sanity and competence combined with how perfect he is for master/stranger protocols. His main flaw is his reckless and self sacrificing nature, likely to get him killed if he doesn't start acting more cautiously.

It is because of this reckless but competent and creative nature that his shard absolutely loves him. Tries to keep him alive and fudges things in his favour more often than not. Maybe it even subconsciously makes other capes aim for his armoured face.

Final PRT ratings:  
Brute 3 (Using good tactics to take advantage of invulnerable face, immovable shield, general resistance to environmental hazards)  
Blaster 3 (Cannon can threaten fairly high rated brutes, wide variety of ammo, no recoil. Rating held back by limited ammo capacity)  
Thinker/trump 3 (Completely ignores a lot of master and stranger effects)  
Striker 2 (Super headbutt and all its variations)  
Mover 1 (Jumping off buildings or aircraft, being launched by other parahumans, operating underwater)  
Shaker 1 (heavy use of AOE grenades)  

Anvil almost certainly died in Gold Morning. Used by Khepri to protect other more valuable capes from Scion's golden stilling beam since he was one of the few parahumans with any level of resistance to it. His severed head was probably used as a small shield until it lost connection with his shard and crumbled. Maybe Anvil was collected by Valkyrie and lives on as one of her shades.",1546141013,"it is because of this reckless but competent and creative nature that his shard absolutely loves him.","reckless but competent","reckless","but",FALSE,"reckless but competent","competent",NA,NA,1

"ecl5t89","You are simply repeating yourself without answering my questions or clarifying your stance. I read your OP and all of your other responses, so I know that you consider gambles related to human life reckless and irresponsible. What you haven’t said, and what I asked for previously, is your logic as to *why* you consider being pro-choice as being related to these things. I am asking because being pro choice by itself does not mean having an abortion or killing a thing that has a possibility of being a human life. The gap in your logic is here:

&gt;Taking such a big gamble is irresponsible. That is pro-choice.

And I simply want to know how you relate taking a risk and being pro choice.

That’s why I included the questions above; I am trying to understand your logic for relating stances on policy to personal action. Here they are again:

&gt;Lets make a comparison. A mother has a child, a toddler by now, but it suddenly needs a bone marrow transplant or the child will die. The mother is a match, the only one available in the time that the child has. The complications of surgery obviously include the possibility of the mother dying, but they are relatively small for a donor. If the mother decided not to do the transplant, would you consider her reckless? Would you consider her irresponsible?


&gt;Now the most important question: would you legally require the mother to donate the bone marrow? Or, put in a more generalized form, would you ever require a person to give up their body, in whole or in part, to another person, as a matter of law? If so, give an example, ideally one that is not abortion.

Feel free to answer these questions if you wish. I promise that it will help me help you change your view.

I ask these questions as the process of donating organs to a child is similar to carrying a child to term (not exact, of course, but hopefully similar enough). I used it because the child is still entirely dependent on the parent, the parent obviously has a duty of care to the child, and there is no question that the child is a human being deserving of rights. I feel it paints the pro life position in the most favorable light, but if you feel otherwise, let me know.

Now, I am trying to draw a difference between having an abortion and believing that everyone should have the option to have an abortion. In the context of your view, it is only mildly relevant whether or not having an abortion is irresponsible or reckless, but for the sake of discussion, I’ll simply assume that it’s true. Do you consider encouraging someone to have an abortion as reckless or irresponsible? How about *discouraging* someone from having an abortion? If I say, “I’ll never have an abortion, and I hope you don’t have one either, but I believe that banning abortions or making them prohibitively difficult to acquire is a net negative for the world, so I refuse to make them illegal.” Is that irresponsible or reckless?",1545835222,"i read your op and all of your other responses, so i know that you consider gambles related to human life reckless and irresponsible.","reckless and irresponsible","reckless",NA,FALSE,"reckless and irresponsible","irresponsible",NA,NA,1
"ecibzl2","FUN/POPULAR SCHOOL EVENTS:
Mostly, I just attend football games personally, but we have some great lecturers and speakers come to campus which I also enjoy! We also tend to get some great bands/other entertainment come to App (Rainbow Kitten Surprise, Avett Brothers, lots of country guys, usually a rap concert every year or so, and a handful of comedians!). The campus also hosts some events, and we have a bunch of awesome clubs! I highly suggest finding a club or group that you would be interested in joining!

OTHER SPORTS:
I have only been to football games thus far, but our Basketball games usually have pretty solid attendance from what I hear, as well as baseball games, and we have an awesome wrestling team (wrestling was ranked 25th in the nation this season). Football is definitely the most attended sport, but from what I’ve heard, the other sports still get some love and good attendance at their events!

RACISTS?:
Hard question, and this may not seem like the best answer, but it really depends on who you are around. There have been problems in the past (ie, a racist group ILLEGALLY hanged a banner on campus, but within half an hour is was taken down by campus PD and the university issued a statement condemning it). There have been some other isolated issues (truly isolated) but in my opinion the campus has done a good job of combating these issues. I personally am a white kid from the country and I hang out with people a lot like me, but I personally have never encountered people of my group who were racist or who tolerated these beliefs. The App community has done a good job of fighting issues we have faced, and generally speaking we are a very loving and accepting community who fights racism whenever it rears it’s ugly head. We arent perfect, but from conversations I’ve had with friends at other universities it doesnt seem like we have any more problems than other universities face. App is not a particularly diverse school (something which the university has been trying to change), but I promise you will find communities of the same ethnicity (I apologize if that is the wrong term) as yourself if that’s important and you will have no problem finding people who share your same beliefs. The people in Boone and App encompass all kinds of life and beliefs, and from my experience 99.9% of people here are kind, loving, and accepting. If you are worried about racism (and that is a very legitimate worry!) I would say that App generally fits the status quo for universities and that we as students do whatever we can to make sure everyone feels welcome and safe. 

I feel like this answer didnt really answer your question haha, so i’ll try to sum it up; if you come to App you will likely never have to deal with racist people or policies (i realize that I’m sayin this as a white guy, but my friends who are black/gay/non christian/etc... would tend to support his claim!). And if you do have to deal with these issues- which again, you likely will not- the university will support you and the students will stand behind you! App has people from every walk of life, and most everyone is kind, loving, and accepting


MALLS/OUTLETS/GOOD EATING:
Good Eating? 100%! We have a good mix of Boone-Specific restaurants (Coyote Kitchen, Daniel Boone Inn, Boone Bagelry,  Taquiera El Paso, etc...) and chain restaurants (fast food, Chilis, that kinda thing). The food here is awesome and there is pretty much a place to eat for whatever you could want!
We do have a mall, and all of the other “necessary” chain stores like Walmart, groceries, and lowes, but a lot of the stores are more family owned small town places. However, anything that you need you can get! There are bunches of cool shops and stores, and the local town of blowing rock also has some really cool places to go to! Boone kind of prides itself on being more small town-esque than big city, but we have a nice mixture of big stores and small ones!

DORMS: 
They can be hit or miss according to some people, but even the “worst” arent all that bad. I was lucky to live in two of the best dorms on campus (Cone and Summit), but i have had friends who lived in the “worst ones” and they still loved them. I will warn you, some of the dorms do not have A/C, but boone rarely ever gets hot enough that it is really necessary (i turned on the A/C like 2-3 times in 2 years on campus). Additionally, the University is in the process of tearing down old dorms and replacing them with new ones, so i think they should all be great! The campus is small enough that none of the dorms are super far from classes, so that is something you dont have to worry about. For example, I lived on the East-most part of campus, and it only took me a MAX of 15 minutes to get to the opposite side!

FRATS:
Fraternity life is definitely active here, but it is by no means required in order to find friends. I never joined one and I have a big group of friends that are the best I’ve ever had! Again, i would suggest finding a club/group that interests you and joining because that is a great way to make friends quickly! I also have friends in frats who love em! But no, it is easy to find friends without being in a frat!

And the winters usually are just from November-April. And while it seems as though we complain a lot, the winters really are the best part of boone! The town usually does a good job of keeping things running and the snow helps build a big community for all of us!

Also, some people have talked about the cops a lot. But generally, the police truly arent out to get anyone. Our Police and Sheriff’s Offices (I know a bunch of the cops here) are more focused on keeping people safe than they are focused on busting people for stupid stuff. Ie, they usually wont bust you for drinking underage (unless you are being dumb and reckless), but they will 100% get you for drinking and driving.",1545723697,"ie, they usually wont bust you for drinking underage (unless you are being dumb and reckless), but they will 100% get you for drinking and driving.","dumb and reckless","reckless",NA,FALSE,"dumb and reckless","dumb",NA,NA,0

Pretty much.

lol My BJJ teacher is very tough and strict and sometimes keeps on lets say an armbar after a tap to make mocking comments in jest for banter but never with the intention to harm or alienate someone. He's very cognizant of that, particularly that if he was to injure someone unnecessarily, they will stop coming. He still puts **a lot** of pressure on us to persevere if we are tired in order to toughen us (some of us do give up quickly), though never tries to convince us to outrun an injury.

Maybe some people who were a little rough and reckless but from what I can remember, there were no idiots that intended to cause harm.

When in the throes of gambling, we have no defence. We become totally powerless against  it. Gambling takes precedence over absolutely everything. Family, Careers, Partners even our own Health. It seems completely irrational and illogical to people looking in that we could be so unthoughtful and reckless. But I promise you things can change.

It will not happen overnight. There will be a long and often painful road ahead but it is possible for a compulsive gambler to arrest this illness. I am testament to that. This time last year I couldn't go a single waking hour in the day without either gambling or thinking about gambling.

Today I am almost a full year off a bet and the complete obsession I had with gambling is gone. The compulsion will always be there but now I know how to treat it. For me that is GA. I'm glad to hear that your husband has reached out for help and is now 30 days since his last bet. It is undoubtedly the best place for us.

As much as partners, family, professionals can sympathise with us, they can't empathise. It's impossible to understand how our mind works to someone that doesn't have the compulsion. Seeking identification with other compulsive gamblers that he is not alone will hopefully be the start of the arresting of his illness and the return to a somewhat normal life.

Being unable to leave your house for a year except with express permission is hardly a chiding. To your point, that doesn't make her sentence lenient. It makes the sentences that send disproportionate numbers of Maori and Polynesians to prison excessive. 

&gt;  because they have good representation, and access to medical services out of the reach of poor brown folk.

Same again. Everyone deserves access to those things, not just a few. She has multiple mental illnesses requiring treatment, which I'd wager would explain her bizarre activity on social media (also mentioned in the [sentencing notes](http://www.districtcourts.govt.nz/all-judgments/2018-nzdc-26177-r-v-le-roux/)). Sending a mentally ill 19-year old to prison for a first-time offense - stupid and reckless, but unintentional  - is unlikely to achieve much. 

And contrary to what has been repeated she has expressed remorse, [which the judge accepted.](http://www.districtcourts.govt.nz/all-judgments/2018-nzdc-26177-r-v-le-roux/) The claims she has shown none come from the family of the deceased - and who can blame them for feeling that way - but reporting it as fact doesn't make it true. 

It *has* resulted in a 140K signature petition being accepted by National on the steps of Parliament for a photo-op. Their solution would be closer to excessive sentences for all and a few more band-aids for mental health and poverty. I'll take a guess that's not the solution you have in mind. 

This case is more difficult to parse than has been presented, and not all relevant circumstances have actually been reported. That didn't stop the media - NZH and Newshub in particular - from packaging it as they saw fit to stoke maximum outrage.

I didn't expect to like Padrap so much. Whew lad that character design and VA are a deadly combination. She's also voiced Ragyo and Temari! I knew she sounded familiar. Bort's interactions with Zircon helped to flesh out her character. I know we saw how she treated Phos as a partner but it was nice to show that she treats the others the same way. [Old Phos was so cute!](https://i.imgur.com/WTGCEYA.png) Phos interacted with more gems in this episode than usual: Zircon, Alex, and Cinnabar. With Zircon, we're shown how Phos has become a gem for others to look up to. Her study time with Alex showcased how determined and knowledgeable Phos has become. 

Finally her interactions with Cinnabar showcased Phos's determination and gave us a view of how Cinnabar feels about her. I would've preferred more conversations between the two throughout the show but I'm happy they talked at all in this ep. It was really sweet that Cinnabar still remembers Phos's promise and is no longer suicidal it seems. No idea how they're gonna pull off this moon plan though. Tbh it seems pretty stupid and reckless but Phos has kinda been doing that from the beginning. At least she has an actual goal in mind and is seeking help instead of doing it alone.

"ebr9l6r","EDIT: I want to add this small preface. I DO love both Travis and Marisha as players a lot and I'm still very much a diehard fan of Critical Role and the cast. Just had to get this off my chest.

TL;DR: *Shakes fist angrily at Fjord and Beau! Cheers and applauds Twiggy!*

Okay, small rant time. And by small, I don't mean small at all.

I can't help but feel like their experiences with dragons from the previous campaign (ie Chroma Conclave) really colored their perceptions in this night's episode. Matt tried his best to continually describe the dragon as young but they seemed to immediately assume they couldn't beat it when the encounter was clearly very winnable in hindsight.

If they'd fought it as an actual encounter from the beginning instead of immediately freaking out and running around like chickens with their heads cut off, it would have easily ended in their favor. Shit, neither Cad nor Jester had to cast a single heal on anyone else (with Jester healing herself just once).

I dunno, just a bit frustrating. And of course, there's Fjord/Travis being an impulsive fella. God he's getting more and more reckless but unlike with say, Caleb, none of the M9 seem to be willing to slap Fjord down. Its getting them into so much trouble lol.

I'm pretty sure this episode should have ended with the start of the dragon fight. They could have EASILY spent a couple hours exploring that Planewalker's study and all it had to offer. But nope, Fjord rushed them the fuck out of it and the dragon fight ended up making it a 5 hour episode lol.

Fjord might literally lead them to their deaths at this point, or at least I feel like one of them will die before this arc is over. I don't know where this damn arc is going anymore. He clearly still has plans to go to Uka'toa's other temples now that he has the other two orbs, but why? Is he just going to give up one orb for Control Water, or is he willing to truly dive off the deep end?

I suppose it would be a wild end to the character for the Mighty Nein to have to put him down because he just went too far, but damn if his intentions just feel all over the place right now.

Also can't help but be a little upset with Marisha/Beau, given the BEST case scenario for her choosing to touch the orb would have been for it to work like the other one, as she expected it to, which would still have teleported her and only her away since no one else was nearby. That moment was the beginning of the end for the fight. Marisha and Beau have their great moments like her handling of the Darktow encounter and the Plank King but they also have their bad moments and tonight was a bad moment. 

Basically, the Mighty Nein didn't have to run... Not until they started running lol. 

But I loved Deborah Ann Woll in this episode and god was it a nailbiter.

"ebb7tr0","Setting; steampunk/Eberron

Jace d’Oriens; a man of 24 years. Stands about 6-feet tall. He is the next heir in line to the Oriens family; a dragonmarked family that controls land transportation (such as the thunder rail). He’s always resented his fathers apathetic approach to family and is the only one looking for his mother in a plague-ridden world. and as such, hates his family and what his dragonmark means to the world: that he is an heir.

His only training is 4 years at a monastery off the coast. He’s a tradition of the way of the elements; homebrewed by Mark “Sherlock” Hulmes, Which treats the way of the elements as more of an avatar the last air bender kind of class.

His affinity is with lighting; and as such his first form he can activate causes electricity to spark off his body. His affinity runs blood-thick as well, his blood perpetually creating small arcs and sparks.

His hair is a lop-sided, silver color, quite messy but straight; layered. His eyes are a very soft sky blue but his gaze is sharp. His skin is pale, and his facial features are sharp due to his years of training to be a monk. His body is also quite toned. His style of fighting is largely quick, fast strikes of both arms and legs.

His clothing is unique: he was gifted a shiftweave: an item that can store 5 sets of clothes on creation, and can change between them as an action. His favorite set of clothing is his white tail coat without sleeves with ornate blue tribal markings and silver trim across the entire tail coat. (Odd note; it’s not buttoned or zippered; it’s more like a T-shirt that has a t-coat. Very monk-y) over the t-shirt-Esque tail coat is small bit of leather-like armor (not actual armor). His shiftweave has other sets as well; a dark variation that is black and gold of his original look (for more stealthy areas), commoners clothing, a formal suit, and the house oriens formal wear (mobster-Esque, with their unique logo [which I imagine is the thunder-rail] emblazoned on the front in gold leaf]).

His legs have baggy grey-brown pants covering them which are tucked into metal-trimmed brown shin-high boots. 

His right arm, which is where his Dragonmark is (tribal blue/purple tattoo - which glows when he uses it. It’s largely random the pattern per house, but each houses’ dragonmark looks similar.) wrapped up and hidden beneath bandages which wrap up and down the length of his arm, down to his palm. he hides the dragonmark because it makes him as an oriens, and an heir to the family. He doesn’t use the power it gives him often; only in dire situations. It allows him to teleport up to his movement speed as a bonus action in a “burst of electrical energy” (something like the movement in the movie “Jumper”).

 He’s rambunctious and reckless. But he cares for his friends. He’s extremely naive in a cocky way. He thinks he can take on the world if he does it right. He’s also quite the harmless pervert. Chasing after women, trying to woo them, only to leave them behind. He gets caught up in moments and isn’t one to think of himself. He’s always eager to fight and tries his best to fight honorable; and enjoys it. (Think Goku.) he’ll limit himself to his opponents level if he has to for a fun fight. But will rise to the occasion if his friends or anyone is in danger. Always eager for a challenge; bored by the details.

Thanks if you do draw Jace! And even if you don’t; writing out his entire description was really a nice, good experience for me!

"ea9a54d","&gt; Let's say a guy offers to buy you a handbag if you have sex with him. You have sex with him and he doesn't buy it. Is that rape? No it's not. It's your fault for being dumb enough to fall for it. They are adults who can make their own decisions. It's morally wrong, but is it rape? Don't you think that takes away from actual forced rape?


do you think being sexually assaulted in the work place with an ass grab takes away from violent alleyway rapes? They’re both bad. Calling them both bad does not take away from how much “worse” the other is. There is no comparative suffering. The logical fallacy of relative privation.

the purse analogy fall flat, probably because the main reason is most girls would demand the bag first. Also it would be more comparable to giving a girl a bag before having sex with you, then running off with the bag after you had already given it to her after you fucked her. Which in those terms would be illegal theft if sex work was legal. Hell if she was your girlfriend and for whatever reason you pulled that shit on her or something similar, that would legally be theft. 

there’s a reason I said rape-y and not rape. You’re not having sex with a fully consenting partner. 

This is known as sexual coercion, “Sexual coercion is when tactics like pressure, trickery, or emotional force are used to get someone to agree to sex. It can be as as simple as encouraging someone to have a few too many drinks, or it can hide inside threats like ""I'll leave you if you don't sleep with me.” (technically robbery would entail physical items like a bag, sexual coercion is something different) 

It’s rape-y. Anything that isn’t fully informed consent is rape-y. 

I don’t know why a dude would find it appealing unless they shit on their own self esteem in their rationale. A “chad” would be able to get any girl he wants without the need for sexual coercion. If you have to dedicate yourself to a community of tricks or something similar, you’re not actually a “chad”, you’re just trying to emulate one. A fake if you will. 

&gt; Lying to a girl to get laid makes you a piece of shit for sure. Is it a crime? no.

I never said it was a crime. Though I think it should be. Should I think the charges should be as harsh as rape charges (lol), no. 

&gt;You keep saying no girl would fall for that but you overestimate those girls. Maybe you're older and wiser but most girls these days do not give a fuck. Maybe I'm just charming. Maybe we are just young. Maybe she didn't see me as marriage material at the time. She will definitely be careful with the next guy. Lol poor idiot.

Maybe it’s just because I’m “older” than a lot of the girls you can fool, and so are my friends. That just makes you sound more predatory which is very gross. and I already told you there are many girls who are naive and stupid and reckless who would fall for that shit, many won’t though. You’re rolling the dice on it when you try with anyone older than their early 20s (I would assume you wouldn’t try for minors though your comments on me being “older and wiser” have me sketched) 

&gt;she will definitely be careful with the next guy. Lol poor idiot 

men aren’t idiots because they don’t care about a woman’s number, I really do detest the habit of people like you who, when they come across people who don’t live the same lives you do and are exceedingly happy, call those people idiots, losers, chumps, etc 

you can’t be any of those things if you are happy with your life and engage with people in purely open connections without manipulation. the dude is usually someone decently attractive  financially stable, has anything he could want materially, probably has a lot of friends and interesting hobbies and now he finds a girl with a great personality who is attractive but he doesn’t care about her body count 

only deluded and shallow people would call him a loser because of the very last of those descriptors. 

Who is the real loser? The honest guy that takes someone’s current character into account instead of judging them for their wild and reckless (but legal behaviors) in their youth or the people that dedicate a good chunk of their time on sexist/misogynistic forums sharing secrets on how to manipulate girls into fucking you and “snaring” a wholesome chick for marriage

Defying the Wizard may have been brave and reckless, but by doing so she was fulfilling her duty to Doctor Dillamond, so there are feelings of obligation and attachment at the core of it. And I think that same sense of attachment is what tied her to her family for so long – she felt the need to do right by them however she could (in this case: by obeying her father and staying), just as she later felt the need to do right by the Animals however she could (by rebelling against the Wizard and leaving). 

On top of that, there are so many layers of guilt at work, because she believed herself responsible for her mother's death and felt that she had to do her best to fill the gap that was left in the family. Abandoning them would have widened that gap and devastated Nessa, and even if it guaranteed her freedom, Elphaba probably wouldn't have considered it sufficient reason to leave – she would have thought herself selfish for doing so.

"e8k6rh0","&gt;Correct. But why should that matter to Renly?

Because. He. Can't. Marry. Her. To. Someone. Who's. Not. A. King. 

&gt;You think Renly will have Mace's ear once he's served his purpose because he's fucking Mace's son. I think that was worth ignoring.

*Favorite son. Yes. Littlefinger himself says Loras is the way to Mace's heart, and pocket. And Mace wouldn't want to upset his dear little Loras by being mean to his Renly. 

&gt;Really? You think Renly thought all this up himself? Or that Olenna is pulling Mace's strings without him realising it?

Yeah I do. Olenna didn't want to support Renly, and she would consider the idea of throwing her sweet granddaughter into the den of lions absolutely appalling. 

&gt;We are talking about Renly's plots while Robert was alive. She was queen, the king was a full-grown man, and yet we still see her bossing him around and getting her way.

Alright. Fair. But I meant the Queen only has power insofar as much as the King gives her. Renly would have equally, or if not more so, influence over Robert as Margaery did. 

&gt;He's greedy and reckless but he's astutely planning for the future and helping out his friends for little-to-no reward. Again, I don't think you have a proper grasp on this character.

No, you're the one who doesn't get it. Renly is not described as someone amoral or callous. He's someone who wants attention (look at me! I'm a king! ) and validation, and as I have repeatedly said, he would get both if his plan went through. He's not someone who would cold bloodedly knock off his brother if he didn't see something glorious in it, or if it wasn't in the heat of battle. Or does the ""playing at war"",""unblooded"", ""boys who think themselves immortal"", ""knights of summer"", ""Renly, dear child, what are you doing"" mean nothing to you? The text repeatedly stresses on how naive and immature he is. So Renly is viewing war as a game, not looking at the big picture, thinking everything will be glorious and not seeing/considering the consequences of his actions. That's his character. 

Oh and no. It still fits. *Renly is not looking at the big picture*. He looks at Cersei and Joffrey, sees he doesn't like them, and thinks he should replace them with his friends, while simultaneously being the person who uncovered the insidious Lan-cest plot, the champion of the realm. There! Still short sighted and greedy, still very Renly. 

&gt;Okay, well, he's already close to the king and could have made friends with Cersei if he'd wanted. Much easier way to the duckets.

Robert barely noticed him. He doesn't like Cersei and she doesn't like him. And he doesn't have the benefits of the whole Lannister regime being his allies. 

&gt;The same way Littlefinger does.

Master of Coin. That's very different. He won't control the finances. He can't steal from the crown. No fraud, or embezzlement, or graft, or commodity trading. He can't do false accounting. He's not Littlefinger, he won't run brothels and shit. 

&gt;Interesting, but how would Littlefinger know? How would anyone know? It seems like some bullshit they've been spreading to get Robert interested, not something Renly actually believed

Littlefinger could catch on to Renly trying to replace Cersei and drop a few hints/whispers. Anyway this isn't something I fully believe in.

&gt;Ignored"" = argued against apparently.

No you did not. You just flat out dismissed them. 

&gt;That ""literal deus ex machina"" is just an assassin, nothing more. One could've got to him at any time; or, he could have fallen in battle. One might argue that he should've been more worried.

No it's not. Its a magical assassin that can cut through steel, travel through walls, and one that  you're not safe from, anytime, anywhere. He had the Rainbow Guard protecting him full time. There was a chance of him dying, yeah, but not much because he wasn't leading from the front, he just played the part of pretty figurehead. 

&gt;And as for his image politics, how did he expect to counter the charge of ""usurper""?

The Maesters could take care of that. 

&gt;And look at the tremendous efforts they went to to conceal their involvement, for fear of Tywin Lannister. And consider how much more difficult it would've been to conceal their involvement in Renly's scheme, and also what happened to the last person to marry a king instead of Cersei.

&gt;But you think they wouldn't be concerned enough about Tywin to try to neutralise him? They'd just hope he rebelled openly and could be defeated in war? 

What efforts? Olenna barely covered her tracks. She killed him in the middle of a wedding. She was highly irresponsible, to say the least. In your version of the scheme they were apparently trying to kill Robert and Stannis and make Renly King. That's a whole lot more risk. And I think they'd want easily controlled Robert rather than Renly as king. 

Yeah, they could have been counting on his pride making him declare war. And they were cautious about it, that's why the plan was moving so slowly. 

&gt;It might be an extra-textual hint to the readers that Renly is in the Tyrells's pocket. It might be Renly trying to subtly signal his commitment to the Tyrell cause; if so, it indicates bad political judgment on his part and thus that he isn't the brains of the operation. Or maybe he just likes the colours. 

It's heavy handed symbolism. And no it wasn't just the colors because his crown was made of roses. Renly chose to wear those colors. It's not something done in a vacuum. It was a deliberate dressing choice that meant something to him. 

Renly was the brains of the whole operation, I'm pretty sure. 

&gt;Or, maybe he's a poor lost orphan boy who just wants somebody to love. Excuse me, I just vomited so hard my actual arsehole came up out my throat.

All the Baratheons are tragic characters. They're all sad orphans. Robert drowns his sorrows in wine and women, Stannis devotes himself to his work and gains no rewards. And Renly is pampered and spoilt and wants attention and acclaim, but that kind of thing doesn't come out of nowhere. Renly was a sycophant in Robert's court (Robert on his deathbed names him as one of the councilors who didn't argue against him, only Eddard did, Eddard said the Council was full of ""fools and flatterers"") so yes, he wants to please people and make friends. You really think the Siege, a year of emotional and material deprivation, or his childhood, or his lack of familial kinship, didn't have an impact on him?   

&gt;Or Freudian slip? Aren't you the one who was horrified that I might be a Stannis-lover?

Yeah, I don't know what you're talking about. 

&gt;He doesn't and isn't. But he might be behind this

Littlefinger saying he wanted Renly on the throne was reverse psychology against Eddard. He joked around with Renly a few times. I don't think there's anything beyond that hinting at their supposed alliance.

I just did a *very* cursory google search with the term ""unintentional but reckless killing"" and found an law article whose subheading is: [""A reckless but unintentional killing is usually either involuntary manslaughter or second degree murder. Determining which can be tough.""](https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/murder-vs-manslaughter-state-mind.html)

Seems pretty appropriate. The name of the crime is going to differ by state, but ""reckless murder"" seems potentially appropriate, though I could see a manslaughter charge being easier to convict on. Probably depends on a number of factors, but it's an interesting question. 

As an aside, I almost brought up the same scenario when I initially pointed out that the guys intentionally threw the pumpkin over the ledge because it was a closer comparison (intentional action leading to unintended consequences), but I didn't because I decided it's still a pretty rough comparison because the difference in what a reasonable person might expect to happen versus what happens is much more vast in the pumpkin throwing situation.

Throwing a pumpkin off of a (second story?) balcony onto an empty sidewalk would not make most people think ""knock out the electricity for the entire block."" In fact, I'm not sure most people would think it would cause any real, significant damage at all. It would be a mess, but that would be it virtually all cases.

Shooting a gun blindly into a wall is just as stupid but much more reckless. First, everyone understands a gun is a deadly weapon and gun deaths are common and understood. Second, any reasonable person would make sure they can see where they are shooting before they shoot, specifically to avoid killing someone.

"e7mwfgd","not sure that this is what you want to hear, but I feel like I was in your boyfriends shoes before.

before I dated my gf, we'll call her B, I dated girl R. R and I moved in together almost immediately, moved across the country together, and was also very pretty and creative. R broke my heart, I crawled back to my hometown with my tail between my legs, and then eventually met B on a dating site. B always felt inferior that I was willing to move in with R, and move out of town for R, felt insecure that we met on a dating site etc. B always was trying to talk about these grand plans for the future, that we'd get married and ""when we move in together"" etc. It lead to a lot of fights - she would openly tell me ""I feel like you'll never love me like you loved R, I feel like shit that you'd move for her but you aren't even willing to talk to me about it or consider living with me"" - Granted B and I had only been dating 6-8 months at this point, it was her first relationship, she was still in grad school. In my head I had done that dumb relationship, I threw caution to the wind and doubled down with R. And it really messed me up. I lost all my money, my car, and wasted some good years of my life all to come out on the other end with nothing to show for it but a shattered ego. I'm must more pragmatic and practical now. It's not that there was anything wrong with B, but I wasn't in a position of being young and reckless. But I think for B, she never had that huge heart ache and wanted that fairy tale of running off into the sunset - even if it didn't work out one day. And ultimately B's feeling of inferiority and lack of experience over time I think became kind of a self fulfilling prophecy. She would tell me she felt like less than R, that I loved her less than R, which made me feel bad like I wasn't doing enough to make her feel secure which just justified her feeling of inferiority, and the cycle went on. 

Those feelings projected on me made me feel like my feelings weren't being validated. being told how I felt made me feel marginalized and that effected my levels of confidence and that effected my connection and relationship with B in a lot of ways. Ultimately I was unable to convince B that being with R was a huge mistake and hurt me and B made me happy while R made me feel used and taken advantage of. B and I split after a while for a lot of reasons, but this was a major point of contention that lasted the entire relationship and never resolved.

I guess my advice is that you should trust your boyfriend. If you want to be with him, you're insecurity is your problem that you need to address. If your boyfriend says he loves you and he made a mistake with the other girl, believe him. The fact is he IS with you now and IS NOT with that other girl - for whatever reason. You can either adjust your view, that he needed to get something out of his system and have some more experience to figure out that you were really the partner he wanted all along (which you should do in partnership with your boyfriend) or you can continue to feel inferior which ultimately is not fair to yourself or your boyfriend.

I wonder how he picked that up?? I'm not seeing anything in his history on WP that would explain fluency in Russian. He's *definitely* pro-Putin:

When asked whether he believed that Russia interfered in the 2016 United States elections, Moore stated, ""Everybody else thinks it's the Russians. I think it was the providential hand of God.""[201][202]

He was commander of an MP battalion in Vietnam, and understandably very disliked by his charges:

&gt;Moore served in several posts as a military police officer, including Fort Benning, Georgia, and Illesheim, Germany, before being deployed to the Republic of Vietnam. Serving as the commander of 188th Military Police Company of the 504th Military Police Battalion,[25] Moore was perceived to be reckless, but very strict. He insisted his troops salute him on the battlefield, despite official training which discourages such behavior because salutes can identify an officer to enemy targeting.[26] Some of his soldiers gave him the derogatory nickname ""Captain America"", due to his attitude toward discipline. This role earned him enemies, and in his autobiography he recalls sleeping on sandbags to avoid a grenade or bomb being tossed under his cot, as many of his men had threatened him with fragging.[24]

There's so much on his Wiki that illustrate what a POS he is. If anyone feels like their blood pressure is too low, give this a read:

"e5o6ecc","&gt; You mean risks like a locked door, denial of entry, a confused and angry resident, and an interior that looks entirely different?

Pretty fucking stupid, right?  Unfortunately, jiggling your key in a lock of the wrong door doesn't in itself rise to the level of recklessness, and making 5 really dumb conclusions in a row to judge your life is in danger by someone unexpectedly in your redecorated and changed key apartment is maybe not reckless but just negligent.

Evidence of recklessness, like she grabbed a drink first and chose to impair her faculties while carrying a dangerous weapon, would be really useful in making a case for manslaughter.  Evidence of any past interactions with the neighbor that could prove that she had reason to willfully kill him would be useful in making a case for murder.  Remember, this case has to be good enough to convince 12 people beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant wasn't just stupid.

The exact jury instruction is this:

&gt; In order to prove this offense, the government need not prove that the defendant specifically intended to cause the death of the victim. But it **must prove more than that the defendant was merely negligent or that he failed to use reasonable care. The government must prove gross negligence amounting to wanton and reckless disregard for human life.** 

Being confused that someone is in your apartment and meaning you harm for no reason is not going to meet that standard.

&gt; I get what you're saying but let's be realistic here: if it was a black man who forced their way into a home that wasn't theirs who shot the resident then called police and admitted to shooting the resident but said ""Oops"", you aren't having difficulty proving jack shit to a jury.

Yes, that may be true.  But: A) acting with undue speed in her prosecution and bumbling it in the process is not going to make that better.  Similarly, B) the solution to unfairness to minorities in the criminal justice system is not to make it similarly unfair to a white officer.

On the other hand, Jessie Murray (a black man) was possibly attacked by five men (the evidence here is ambiguous), and *went to his car, retrieved a weapon, and returned to the scene* --- killing one of them, a former police officer, in questionable self-defense, and prosecutors ended up taking a plea deal where he plead to weapon charges and did not even get a manslaughter conviction.

These confused/stupid-self-defense cases are very problematic/wobbly/difficult to prove to begin with-- there's a fairly low conviction rate across the board.  When you combine that with many people liking and deferring to authority figures/police officers... and prejudiced attitudes towards minority victims, you create a set of circumstances that allows cops to walk at an even greater rate.  The solution to this is to attack those attitudes, not to erode the standard of proof for crimes.",1536511169,"unfortunately, jiggling your key in a lock of the wrong door doesn't in itself rise to the level of recklessness, and making 5 really dumb conclusions in a row to judge your life is in danger by someone unexpectedly in your redecorated and changed key apartment is maybe not reckless but just negligent.","reckless but just","reckless","but",FALSE,"reckless but just negligent","negligent",NA,"just",1

"e3v70t9","*My phone rings and a familiar voice is on the other end, one of my colleagues.*  

Yes, I saw the news.  FRA…  Two dead at least.  That’s a bunch dead in the last week.  Henderson told us when we cut off their funding their ability to wage any significant attacks would disappear.  Seems like *that* was a slight miscalculation…  yeah, well Henderson is a fucking idiot.  I could have told you that.

No, it isn’t a problem as long as the capitol stays safe.  Which it seems like it is… for now.   But it still draws international attention to the Empire, and I don’t like attention.  We don’t need attention now.

OK, yeah keep me updated.  This isn’t my area of expertise so you people figure it out, but we need to kill that hornet’s nest that *we* riled up.  I kidnap bitches; you guys arm them or kill them.  Or arm them *and then decide afterwards* to kill them as the case may be.  Anything else, I am heading to the stadium to watch gymnasts shake their asses?  It is good to know the [Commissar](/u/That_Sly_Bastard) and the [Queen](/u/empireroyalty); my seats are great for a simple herring importer.  Oh?  OK, I am listening…

*After I listen for a moment, my eyes flash with annoyance.*

Her?  You want to take her!?!  Are you out of your goddamn mind!?!  That is pretty fucking reckless.  After all she has said recently, you don’t think a bunch of fucking red flags will be raised, a bunch of alarms will go off, if she disappears?  We don’t need that kind of attention.  Nor does the Empire!

No, I am cautious, not *overly* cautious.  And I am pretty good at my fucking job and I don’t need you to question my wisdom, or my sense of caution.  Well I *do* take it pretty fucking personally.  My instinct on when and when not to be cautious has earned us a lot of fucking money and kept us off everyone’s radar.  Now you are second guessing…

Well we just took the daughter of a fucking congresswoman who was criticizing the Empire, at their request.  Now they recklessly have that congresswoman prancing around in public, and god knows what those reckless fucks are going to try with the Salize girl.  Now I am hearing rumors Civilisation is gonna try something with [Becky Winters](/u/BeckyWinters), as if the *whole fucking world* won’t notice that.  People are gonna start noticing and putting these things together.  It’s a pretty easy goddamn pattern to decipher.  This type of shit comes out and we are talking US fucking airstrikes, not UN sanctions.  Then  our whole plan here is over.  Phase 1 is over before we even start Phase 2 and 3.  I told you I think the Empire and the Commissar are too fucking reckless with these things and you want to double down and take *her* of all people?  That is almost as bad as Becky Winters.  We need to keep a low profile, not blow it up with…


Yes, I am sure we can come up with a plan to take her but that will be pretty fucking risky considering who she is.  And a lot of fucking things can go wrong. Even if they don’t, people will find it pretty suspicious when she disappears, after all she has been saying.  And besides that you don’t think people will notice if she disappears.  And why her, especially now?  What, we are just gonna present this cunt to the Commissar without him even requesting it?  Why the fuck would…  

Wait, she isn’t for the Commissar or the Empire?  Then why are we even taking her?  Who is she for?  Oh… Jesus Christ how did she get on the old man’s radar?  Well OK… yeah, of course that changes things.  It’s still fucking stupid and reckless but I guess I don’t have a choice now, if the request is coming from *him*…

"e3uyzyr","See, this is what I mean. *I* don't have a clue, and yet I know that he's in court for alleged defamation, and NOT for inciting violence, as you claim.

Death *threats* are not acts of violence by definition. Despite that fact, you'd have a hard time arguing that Jones ""incited"" these threats, considering all he did was present his scepticism of the event on his Youtube channel. By your definition, criticism of anything *or anyone* to an audience preluding to death threats would equate to inciting violence. We're lucky that's not yet the case.

Mate, you haven't provided any facts whatsoever.

Listen, I'm relatively unfamiliar with Jones, as I imagine is also the case with you. Because we don't listen to his content everyday, our opinions are reflective of what he hear from [outside sources.](https://qz.com/1335125/infowars-alex-jones-threatens-to-shoot-robert-mueller-in-his-latest-video/) A lot of these platforms use rhetoric to purport ideas that are consumed on mass and result in this echo chamber of unfounded hate.

I like to challenge the general consensus, so that's why I'm asking these questions.

There's a lot of exaggeration, a lot of redefining terms to falsely accuse him of terrible things, but not a lot of facts.

"e341n5q","""Well, well, what do we have here? A pretty little thing, walking all by herself in the big, dark woods.""

The young girl paid no attention and continued her steady gait through the grassy path. She wore her green hood up, all but covering the dark curls of hair framing her expressionless face. Only her eyes conveyed any emotion; they flickered with annoyance, but kept their focus on some point far ahead.

The man who had called out to her was not to be cowed, however. ""Oh, don't pout now, sweetie,"" he drawled. He began strolling alongside her, taking longer strides to match her speed. His oafish companion, stout and portly, struggled to keep up. ""We Just want to talk, is all. Maybe have a bit of fun later.""

""Leave me alone,"" she finally spoke. Her voice was flat, nearly devoid of intonation; yet, there was a subtle, dangerous flavor tucked beneath the simple words. ""I have no quarrel with you.""

Her *Fae-tongue* was surprisingly good, and the first man hesitated. But his companion filled in the silence. ""Who said anything of quarrel? No, my lovely dear, we are friends,"" he said eagerly. ""Interested in only friendly things.""

""I am *not* friendly.""

""Oh-ho-ho!"" The short man guffawed, and other joined in after a moment. ""A feisty one! Well, we like those, too! Eh, why don't you come to our abode? It's not far from here. We can show you quite a wonderful, feisty time...""

The girl did not answer except to increase her pace.

""Say, won't you at least tell us your name?"" The taller man asked. He easily matched her pace, and had crept closer; they nearly bumped elbows now. ""No doubt it is as lovely as your body. Just your name, dearest, that's all we want.""

She stopped walking. The tall man, surprised, almost stumbled in his footing; the stout fellow, huffing in the back, all but crashed into his companion. The girl pulled down her hood and turned to look at the men. A half-grin twisted her face. ""Perhaps you could tell me yours' first? We can make a trade.""

Again, the tall man, being the more shrewd one of the duo, mentally took a step back. She was most decidedly human, at least in her appearance - but her manner of speaking reminded him of his kind. Dangerously so. Could she have *Fae* blood?

The stout man chortled. ""Oh, I don't think we can quite make such a trade, you naughty thing. Our kind do not give names out as readily as yours do, you know. Our names are too precious to us.""

""And yet you ask for mine? Begone, you miserable excuse for fairies."" She turned swiftly to resume her course.

The stout man shot out a hand and gripped her the arm. ""It seems you are forcing our hands here,"" he said roughly, tugging. ""Insulting us, running away, denying us...give us your name, now!""

""Let go. I won't ask again."" Her voice was nothing but steel.

A shiver went down the tall man's spine. ""Alright, alright, we're going,"" he muttered, palms out in surrender. ""Come on, let's get out of here--""

""And let this pretty piece of flesh escape? Not on my life."" The stout man licked his lips and brought his other hand onto her, groping. ""Help me, would you? We don't need her name - more fun when they struggle, anyway--""

Suddenly, there was a flurry of movement and a flash of metal. The tall man watched with dawning horror as his companion lurched back; his fingers were no longer touching the girl. Instead, they lay curled up on the forest floor, soaking crimson into the forest loam. He held his hand and screamed.

The girl quietly sheathed her blade and walked away from the scene. Neither man attempted to stop her; the tall one stared after her in a daze.

Finally, she came upon her destination: a simple wood-cabin in a pretty glade.

""Master?"" She called out upon entering the bedroom. ""I have returned.""

""Yes, so I see."" The bed-ridden fairy squinted at her rumpled clothing. ""You had some trouble?""

""I dealt with it swiftly. Oh, but I thought you might find it amusing...they demanded my name.""

He smiled weakly, without humor. ""Indeed?""

""Too bad for them, I had none to give."" She sat down on the edge of bed. ""I have brought some herbs from deep within the forest. They will help ease your pain.""

He shook his head. ""And what of yours? What greater pain is there than the loss of one's own name?""

She twisted her mouth in contemplation. ""You have been saying often as of late, but I still fail to understand. I have traded well for it; this youth, this cunning, this speed in my limbs - well worth such a simple cost. Anyway, I can still hear it from your lips.""

""*Ceri*. Ceri. Ceridwen,"" he breathed. It was a beautiful word - one that once brought him great satisfaction, and now only guilt and remorse.

She smiled.

He sighed. """"I did you a great disservice, swindling you out of your name - but I was young, greedy, and reckless. But I am comforted to know that when my illness ends, I will too - and you will have your freedom back.""

She furrowed her brows. ""I cannot imagine what that will feel like - not to have a master anymore. It frightens me.""

""My dear Ceri, trust me: you will be ecstatic once you recover this most personal freedom that I have stolen. I only pray that you will one day find it in your heart to forgive me.""

There's a lot of ways to cheat using PEDs and a lot of ways around getting caught. Even before this Jon had already been banned for using prohibited substances. 

There was a steroid in his system  before the second DC fight. Regardless of how it happened he had an unfair advantage and had the win overturned. 

There are a few options as I see it:
1. Jones knowingly took the steroid to improve his performance.
2. Jones unknowingly took the steroid accidentally, despite doing everything he could to avoid it.
3. Jones is reckless and takes anything he's given and one of those had a steroid in it.
4. Someone maliciously tampered with his food/water.

All 4 are technically possible, but some are much more likely than others.

The onus is on Jon to not take PEDs to have an advantage over his opponents. He is acutely aware of this as he is a repeat offender. 

Could someone have sabotaged him? It's possible, but it's incredibly unlikely. 

Other than video evidence of someone  taking a pill while saying ""Mmmm tasty steroids"" you can't prove anyone deliberately took PEDs. That can't be the standard for conviction, no one could be proven guilty.

All we can do is try our best to test and catch where there is a performance enhancing drug present and allow the athlete an opportunity to provide evidence as to why they had an unfair advantage but it was not their fault.

"e28v6j7","It had been a while since I'd been in the slums for a job. There was a reason for that, besides the smell: I'd cultivated a very specific reputation. Precise. Untraceable. Just.

Expensive.

Ordinarily, one wouldn't announce to the world when one kills a person, but I'd earned that reputation thanks to my one rule: I don't kill innocents. When someone paid me to kill someone I felt was innocent, I killed them instead. When the leader of a small guild of muggers and cutpurses hires me to off a soldier, guard, or shopkeeper who'd caught one of their lackies, they always bragged to their guildmates, and when that plan backfired, the guildmates spread horror stories.

I shoveled a pile of horse droppings while trying not to grimace - a disguise didn't work if you couldn't play the part - and glanced at the inn across the street. A young woman in a dirty dress stood outside the door, looking up and down the street. She was very conspicuously waiting for someone.

Normally I wouldn't have met with someone so careless, but most of my clientele were rough looking men - well, more nobles recently - and I was curious. I brought my shovel around to the back, and leaned it against the stable. I hid my disguise in a pile of hay, and took the long way around, avoiding unwanted eyes, and looking for a possible ambush. When I was satisfied, I approached the inn from the alley, and stopped, looking down on the nervous girl from beneath my cowl.

""Are you looking for someone?""

A breath caught in the girl's throat, and she flinched at my sudden appearance. Jumpy. She at least had the presence of mind to not scream. She took a moment to try to look at my face through the shadows, then spoke.

""I think you're who I'm looking for.""

""Say it."" It was melodramatic, but new customers were usually looking for that. I remembered the first time I'd taken a contract on a noble. It was an impossible job from a desperate serving woman. A notoriously cruel baron had beaten her for some slight, she had wanted the city to know he was murdered for justice. I disguised myself as a guard, and killed him that night. I left my calling card.

""The Serpent."" Her voice was tiny. Quiet, as though just saying my name was wrong.

Most professionals rolled their eyes at the drama of scary-sounding names, black hoods, and midnight meetings, but we all recognized that if you wanted new contracts, you needed a little showmanship. There were other assassins in the city - Wolf, The Spider, Shadow Strider, Nightbane - but The Serpent was the most famous, particularly among nobles, who expected a terrifying killer. Most of the time, kills that didn't have a trace or a calling card were attributed to him, and probably only half of them were true. Trying to correct rumors yourself was both petty and reckless, but since The Serpent killed his clients if they were evil, I could just leave a sign, and everyone assumed the dead man had tried to hire the wrong killer, and it came back to bite him, and the real client could never be traced. In reality, the vast majority of his targets were corrupt. Especially the nobles taking out contracts on each other. But it was such a perfect form of advertising the handful of other assassins I'd met wondered if it was all a gimmick.

""The rumors say he kills his clients if he doesn't like them. Why would you want to find him?"" I asked the girl. Her eyes slowly widened, having caught the subtle threat.

She spoke slowly, choosing her words carefully. ""Because... I hear y- he hates evil. And I'm desperate."" She set her jaw, and looked up at me, where she thought my eyes should be.

""And how do you plan to meet him?""

""I've seen The Serpent's call sign carved into one of the tables. I heard he used to take contract from here."" She was right. I'd stopped checking most of my other meeting spots in the slums, but I'd gotten my start here, and I didn't want to let myself forget where I'd come from. Lucky for her. It also explained why she didn't hire someone cheaper - this girl wouldn't have deep underworld connections.

""And who would you have The Serpent visit?""

""My Master, William Gunderson."" She looked down. ""A cobbler, who lives near the river."" After living on the north side of that river for some years, I didn't recognize the name, but I would do my due diligence. One last question.

""And how would you pay him?""

Her shoulders slumped. It was all the answer I needed. I turned, and walked away.

""Wait!"" The girl caught my sleeve, and I restrained myself from striking her. I turned, removing my cowl to stare daggers at her, but I saw her big, tired eyes - God, she was so young! Had I thought she was an adult from far away? - and sighed. She quickly released me, realizing how much danger she was just in, and stepped backwards, bumping into the doorframe.

""Please sir,"" she pleaded, barely a whisper. ""He has no wife, and no other apprentice. You can take all the money he has. Please... He's... A monster."" Her lip quivered, and I knew I was done.

After a long moment, I nodded. ""Fine.""

The girl's eyes didn't light up, like she was getting a gift. She understood that this meant a man would die, and it would be her fault. She didn't look hopeful either. She must have known that her future wouldn't magically get better because of this. Girls on this side of the river didn't have fairy tale endings.

The innkeeper poked his head out the doorway, and quickly located the girl a few feet from him. ""Ah, miss, your room is all ready for you.""

The girl looked at me. ""Yes. Thank you."" Satisfied, the innkeeper ducked back into his busy kitchen. Her words had obviously been for me as well.

""Do you come here often?"" I asked her.

""No, but I wasn't sure how long I'd have to wait for you."" She stepped inside, and disappeared. 

---

I'd been watching William Gunderson for several days. I learned his schedule, and his patterns. He was rigid and private. He didn't piss into the river like most men who lived on the south shore. He didn't go out drinking. He spent long stretches in a room I couldn't see - Presumably where he did his work - and lived alone in his shop. 

His work was shoddy at best, even for the slums, and he rarely had customers. The most I'd seen was three in a day, and there were some days when no one went in. There was no way this man could still be in business if this was indicative of his business, and yet he still bought a basket of supplies every few days. This place was obviously a front. 

Two days into my observation, William had adopted a limp. When the tanner he bought his supplies from asked about it, he had said ""None of your damn business.""

I was curious of what he could possibly be up to, and wary of anything that might present complications in my work. unknown variables were the number one killer in this profession. I'd have to take extra precautions for this job, but I was in no rush. I'd find out what it was once the job was done.

---

William Gunderson closed his shop late. Well past sunset. People don't usually go shopping for shoes in the middle of the night, but no one looked twice at someone who did. It was odd, but not conspicuous unless you were looking for something. I stepped into the shop a half hour after dark, and called out.

""Excuse me, Master cobbler?"" I spoke loud enough so William could hear me from his ""workshop"" but not so loud that passersby could. After a few seconds, he limped around the corner. He stood in the open, next to the counter, but didn't lean against it. This was as good a time as any.

""You're leg bothering you?"" I jumped forward, and he immediately tensed. With more dexterity than an injured man should have, William jumped backwards. He reached into a hidden slit in the side of his pants, and pulled a sword from it. It wasn't an injury that prevented him from bending his knee, it was a hidden weapon. 

I couldn't help but furrow my brow as I leapt back, leaving my small dagger barely an inch in William's shoulder. I had been careless. Killing nobles for other nobles had changed the way he saw people. It made him sloppy. It was different killing gangsters. Luckily I had been prepared.

William stood out of his low fighting stance when he saw me retreat, unarmed. ""You're the one who's been following me. Were you going to rob me with a knife? Do you know who I am?""

""You're a dead man, William Gunderson. That's all either of us need to know."" I draw the sword strapped to my back under my tunic. From the brief glimpse of a fighter's stance I saw, I knew he wouldn't be an easy opponent. Luckily I had been prepared.

My target's sword clattered to the ground, much to his confusion. ""Red asp poison. Numbs you within seconds. You'll be fully paralysed in a minute. If you're lucky, you'll choke to death on your own tongue. Otherwise...""

William batted weakly at the knife in his shoulder. It was barely a wound, but it was enough to get the venom into him. I didn't want to take any chances. Unknown variables were the number one killer  in this profession.

""Damn..."" William said, sliding to his knees. ""The Serpent... But..."" I didn't want him to fall on his back and suffocate just yet. I approached, and propped him up against the counter.

""While you can still talk,"" I started. ""Tell me what you really are.""

""I never... thought we'd meet,"" William struggled to say. ""Like this."" He tried to unbutton his tunic, but had no feeling left in his fingers. Instead he tore it open, revealing a tattoo on his collarbone. It said Nightbane. He was another assassin. A popular one.

""And that girl you apprenticed...""

Something small hit my back. Then glanced off my ribs. It was a blade, sticking through my back and out my chest. I stared in disbelief, and tried to turn to see what it was.

She was standing there. ""You...""

She didn't look so young anymore. She was small, but... street rats didn't grow like kids with money. I grimaced.

""My biggest competitors."" She laughed.

"e24gyig","&gt;  Rey finds out her origin! but they are nobody.

This bugs me to no end. No she doesn't find out, she doesn't find out anything. Kylo *tells* her. That's literally all there is to it as far as actual information goes. Yes there's that trippy mirror scene in that cave, but that doesn't so much reveal actual information as is more of a spirit quest vision thing. Too much in these movies is actually told, not shown.

Actually give this quick segment a watch: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxKtZmQgxrI&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=406. It's the classic Plinkett review of The Phantom Menace, the part where he asks people to describe Star Wars characters as if to someone who's never seen it, without describing their profession or role in the movies or what they look like.

We're now two movies in and this is what I got for the main characters:

Rey - independent, headstrong survivalist. Has virtually no background story at all. As in all we know is she got left on that planet by her parents and has since fended for herself selling junk to traders. No idea what she actually wants in life, what she likes or doesn't like. Though she's kind of into technology and spaceships so I'll give her that. 

Could have had a bit more survivalist stuff from her, that would actually be interesting. Like stealth in the desert to sneak up on First Order peeps, or hide effectively when getting away etc. that sort of thing. Would be cool right?

Finn - he's, uhh, I guess morally torn? I don't know, in one scene he's like a hardened soldier speaking from experience and in the next he's a bumbling goofball who doesn't know what's happening. Complete waste of a character. 

Imagine this instead: in TFA at the start Finn recognises that this was actually his home planet, or home village or whatever. He keeps the mask on because he can't bear to reveal himself but inside he cries, a lot, and he takes his mask off and we go from there. Not a fucking janitor or a guy who quit on the first mission, but someone who's been in this because of life circumstances or because he thought he was doing the right thing or whatever. He's seen some shit but this was too much for him, *an experienced soldier with knowledge about how things are in the Empire/First Order*. He and Poe Dameron can bond over it, talking about training and TIE fighters or something, he realises Poe is like a brother to him or is basically who he could have been if he didn't grow up on a planet held by the Empire and basically grew up with that.

Poe Dameron - Again, wisecracking smartass and pretty dashing and reckless but that's about it. NO idea about his background or anything at all. He's barely even in the movies so ok I guess but he's like not even in half of the movies. Wasted opportunity for him to bond with Finn more. THEY should have gone on that clandestine mission in TLJ, not Finn and who the fuck is she.

Kylo - he's a mopey edgelord who for some reason wants to learn the ways of being the hugest asshole the world has ever seen but he's not all the way to being 100% evil. But he's basically 99.99% evil because he does murder a lot of innocent people. But because he's young and handsome and a potential love interest we have to hold out some kind of sympathy for him? He's a *bit* more thoughtful than the rest, even if his actions negate all of that wisdom entirely. Also possible that the scenes of him waxing philosophical were actually entirely Snoke's fabrication. So he's bad and he wants to be even more bad and is butthurt that he isn't. Main antagonist and of course they play his violent outbursts for laughs, as is tradition in the more godawful of the Star Wars movies.

Hux - Uhh is this even a character, he's kind of like a caricature of a sniveling Nazi henchman.

So yeah there's a little bit more characterisation to them I'll admit, but really not much of substance. Note again that we're in the second two hour movie now and we still don't really know or care about these characters.",1531227032,"poe dameron - again, wisecracking smartass and pretty dashing and reckless but that's about it.","dashing and reckless","reckless",NA,FALSE,"pretty dashing and reckless","dashing",NA,"pretty",0

"e1v0ofe","This is an extremely thoughtful analysis--for now, I've only read up to your ideas on an alternative ending, but I wanted to chime in before I forgot my own thoughts!

I agree with you about Rachel and the final mission. I still struggle with the plotting of that last mission. It seemed like KAA manufactured a way to get Rachel isolated, preferably on Jake's orders, so she could be killed and kill Tom in return. Oh, and the Yeerks had to be defeated, too. The way KAA managed it is a bit convoluted. It took me ages to wrap my head around the actual events of this last arc, and it still doesn't make sense that Jake would make such a poor plan (not just poor--pointless) and that Rachel would just go along with it. As you say, I feel like the ""Rachel is borderline psycho"" subplot was more ""tell"" than ""show"". Characters kept saying she wouldn't know what to do with herself after the war, but I never *saw* it. She was assertive and occasionally reckless, but no more so than anyone else on the team, really.  She could've channeled that aggressiveness. She had a family and Tobias to ground her after the war.

I don't really agree with you on the Jake point. The kids become effectively a guerilla military unit and act in para-military ways. And as much as they suggest that choosing Jake as leader was chance (r a whim or whatever), it wasn't. Jake was the calm one, the one who seemed to have it all together (unlike Rachel, who was kind of reckless already, or Marco who was still a bit messed up over his mom's death, or Cassie who isn't very assertive, or Tobias who was something of a ""loser""). He *didn't* always have it all together, of course, but he seemed to. We see this mostly when we're in his POV, because he doesn't generally show his doubts or weaknesses to the others. He can't. Once he's proclaimed leader, he has to *act* like the leader, and he ends up collapsing under the strain. But *someone* had to be leader. You can't have a paramilitary group like this without someone taking point and making decisions. And when you make decisions like that, and when you make bad ones, it screws you up. I don't think Jake's storyline derails the overall narrative. I think it makes it much richer; I think it makes the narrative that we got *inevitable.* I find it the most compelling arc in the series.

As for Cassie, yes, I think that's what the message is: that hard-line pacifism may be just as destructive as warmongering, because eventually someone has to face down the evil. Ax even says something very much like that in one of the final books after she's give up the morphing cube. And THAT I also have plot issues with, which I think I'll discuss at another time (but as far as a character development and how it changed the group dynamics, it was a compelling twist).

ETA: To add to what I said about Cassie, and this is going to seem kind of contradictory: in spite of this theme of Cassie's actions having dire consequences, I think we're supposed to ultimately think she was right, or at least fighting the ""good fight"". And the way I read it, Cassie was asked to stay behind not because she wasn't good enough but because she was *too good* to go on what amounted to a suicide mission. Your reading is, of course, completely valid, too.

"e1uzilx","I was acting on the assumption that what you honestly thought and said here was what you might say in the situation and I was pointing out it was a horrible defense. ""I didn't see it"" or ""I didn't have time to stop"" is completely reasonable. And I recall some years back there was a rash of pedestrians wearing dark colors in areas without streetlights and often jaywalking getting hit by cars. The drivers were not responsible, nor should they have been deemed so, and the prevailing attitude in my circles was that the pedestrians were not only being reckless but causing psychological trauma to the drivers that hit them.

Allowing your dog to run out into the street or in general be off-leash  outside a yard they can't leave or a designated off-leash area like a dog park is reckless and typically illegal and poses a danger to that dog, humans, and other animals. Insurance shouldn't cover the owner in that case and the owner is clearly to blame and the driver is clearly not. This sounds like what is happening in the main post.

The dog sneaking out a gate/door unexpectedly is an accident and is no one's fault. There seemed to be an assumption made that any dog off-leash running in the street is there because the pet owner was irresponsible, but that isn't always the case. It's just an accident, a tragic one from the owner's POV.

I once forgot to shut the front gate when bringing stuff in and my housemate decided to stand there and hold the door open for me to come in because I had groceries. She was expecting cats to try to sneak out but not the other housemate's dog. Normally he is indoors or in the backyard and really content but that day he decided to bolt and make me chase him (housemate physically couldn't assist). I didn't really associate with the dog much so he wasn't inclined to obey me and thought making me chase him was great fun. Thankfully neighbors who have dogs of their own helped me catch him and bring him home. Dog owning housemate was not home. It was no one's fault he got out. Usually the front gate is closed and usually we don't hold open the front door so cats don't dart out. If he had gotten hit by a car it wouldn't have been the driver's fault, but it wouldn't have been our fault either. After that he never again tried to dart off like that, and as far as I know he never had before.  

Am I unwelcome? It did not appear that this was a closed subreddit. I have not said that hitting a dog is evil, just that not watching for them is rather reckless. OP wanted help talking to a dog lover. I may not want dogs of my own, but I don't hate them, so I felt I could offer a little perspective on the side of the person they were talking with to help convince the dog lover they are being unreasonable.

&gt;In the 1960's in Jackson, Mississippi, people of colour endure conditions that wouldn't have been out of place in the 19th Century. Coloured women work for the white elite as maids and look after their children for a minuscule wage that leaves them living on the edge of poverty. Racism is omnipresent. The modern and open-minded Skeeter has just graduated from college and follows her dream to become a journalist and writer. At the local “Jackson Journal” she is given a chance to gain experience as a column writer for housekeeping. Breaking the strongly established conventions, she receives help from the maid Aibileen, who is employed at the house of one of Skeeters’ friends. Contrary to common opinion, Skeeter regards the maids as no different to white people and builds a strong relationship with Abileen when she decides to interview the Afro-American maids of the city for her own publication. Although this at great risk as what she is doing is against the law. She begins to lose touch with her former circle of friends who adhere to the way of the time in which having a husband and leaving their children to a maid instead of mothering them themselves is normal. Ironically, these women are the ones who organise charity fundraisers for starving people in Africa, whilst they at the same time treat their own coloured maids like animals. After a time, Skeeter gains support from a reckless but brave maid called Minnie. Together with Abileen, a chain of events unfolds in which they are able to convince several other maids to tell Skeeter stories of their lives. After Skeeter finishes anonymising their experiences, a New York label publishes a scandalous book of her work which leads to trouble in Jackson as everyone soon realises where it is set.

&gt;The Help is a social drama and an adaption of the similarly named novel by the American writer Kathryn Stockett, published in 2009. The Disney production is directed by Tate Taylor and stars the following glorious actors: Emma Stone as Skeeter; Jessica Chastain as Celia Foote; Viola Davis as Aibileen; Bryce Dallas Howard as Hilly; and Octavia Spencer as Minny, who won an Oscar for the best supporting actress.

&gt;Skeeter is a young woman who does not want to stick to old traditions and fights against racism by supporting coloured maids. She wants to publish something that is going to help the maids and therefore builds up a relationship with Aibileen, a maid of one of her friends, in order to achieve this. Hilly, who is strictly conservative, demands that no maid should ever use the toilet inside her house and fires her own maid, Minny, after ~~pretendedly~~ (*this isn't a word, and I'm not sure what you're trying to say*) using it while it was stormy outside. Minny accepts a new job at Celia Foote’s home and later joins Abileen and Skeeter working on a new publication. The basic, underlying theme of the movie is about the ongoing racism in one of the most conservative cities of the time, and the living conditions coloured people had in these days, ~~while there is a ray of hope in Skeeters plans~~ (*this either needs to be expounded upon, or removed from this sentence altogether, as it doesn't fit here on its own*). Essentially, the overall atmosphere changes throughout the course of the movie, because in one moment you feel sorry for the maids and in another, you celebrate with them. But in general, most of the time you are shocked by how cruel humans can be to one another based on the colour of a person's skin.

&gt;Technically, the movie is particularly well made and is convincing with solid camera work and an outstanding soundtrack that allows the viewer to feel the emotions the scenes are attempting to convey. The intention of the film is clear: It wants to show how white Americans were treating people of colour in the 19th century, and contrast that with today's society. In the end, it conveys how essential basic human rights and equality are. I personally like almost everything about this production. The acting is fantastic. The camera work is solid. The soundtrack is phenomenal. The plot and characters are ~~round~~ (*developed? Rounded?*) and the 20th Century setting is convincing. It might be slightly ~~fancy~~ (*don't know what you mean by this*) and plays the cruelty down at some points, but this makes the movie suitable for a younger audience. The film is not too long, ~~but favours the emotional watch~~ (*again, I'm not entirely sure what you mean by this?*).

&gt;I can only recommend that everyone should watch this as it is suitable for all ages and is a great film for any family that might be sitting in front of the TV on Saturday night. The message, especially, is of enormous value for the youth as, although they hopefully will never experience actual racism, they should still understand how it used to affect people and how it has changed.

&gt;All in all, the movie is, in my opinion, a masterpiece. It combines an important message with a correlating and historically accurate story, an exciting plot, fitting characters, great acting, an outstanding soundtrack, and quality scenery.",1529017914,"after a time, skeeter gains support from a reckless but brave maid called minnie.","reckless but brave","reckless","but",FALSE,"reckless but brave","brave",NA,NA,1

"dznsaa4","Nathaniel never actually tries to kill you. He breaks into Vigil's Keep -- his family's ancestral home -- with plans to kill you, but then he backs out. He never even raises a finger to you. No poison, no traps, nothing. Zevran, on the other hand, actually does lay a trap for you and does actually try to kill you. 

Nathaniel's ""Oh, yeah? Maybe I'll come back and really kill you!"" seems like bullshit bravado (at least it did to me the first time I heard it). And my Warden wasn't worried about him actually succeeding at it, being ""royally tough to kill"" and all that. 

Nathaniel's reason for breaking into his ancestral home is because he's clearly deeply confused about what actually happened during the war. He seems convinced that his father was just ""on the wrong side"". Even if you, as Warden-Commander, don't know that he's eventually going to come around, you can see that he's clearly misguided. Zevran, however, knew exactly what he was doing. He was a professional assassin (hired by none other than Nathaniel's father, though Nathaniel would have no knowledge of that, of course). He was under no illusions and was in no way confused. 

Finally, the Warden-Commander is pretty damned short-handed. Throwing away a misguided, possibly reckless, but ultimately non-lethal would-be assassin when he could be a Grey Warden and actually help the cause seems like a waste. This is especially true if your Warden-Commander recruited Zevran. Comparing Zevran to Nathaniel would show that Nathaniel is a different case altogether, and he has far more potential for reform than Zevran did (though, of course, Zevran does come good in the end).

"dzni5kj","Okay so whilst I agree with the premise of this post, and will always agree that if you're not happy or in a toxic relationship, get out. Whether that's because the person has a mental illness, condition or just because it isn't working. 
However the statement ""these people are toxic and not worth it"" is incredibly damaging to those who have BPD but are working on functioning in a less damaging way, such as myself. If you said the same about someone with depression, there would be uproar. Think about it. 

I myself am a high functioning individual with diagnosed BPD and most of what you said is apparent with myself, also. But as with any condition, any illness, any person - these things vary. 
For example, I can and am very willing to accept fault and accountability for my actions. For a long time, I couldn't. I wasn't able to see things from others perspectives and assumed that if it was right for me, then it was right. But over time I began to realise the effect my actions took on others and began to change my way of thinking. 

Stonewalling is something that I do often. But let me explain, it is not that I don't care, or that I can't communicate or empathize with the other person. The only way I can explain it is that the emotions build up, they twist and they magnify until my brain cannot cope with the constant overload of emotions, it switched off and I become vacant. It's not until after that I start to rationalize and think about thing, it usually hits all at once, causing irrational responses, suicidal thoughts or actions, self harm, self damaging behaviour. We process information differently to ""normal"" adults. The emotions and logic comes in waves, gone one minute, violently occuring the next. 

I guess what I'm trying to say is that you're exactly correct. Nobody should be in a relationship with anyone that treats them that way but to discount an entire subcategory of people is unfair and unjust. I, myself, have been in a relationship now for 7 years. I have bad times, times where I'm completely irrational, inconsolable, damaging and reckless. But I'm human, I realise my mistakes, I work on them and have made huge progress. 

Also, I actually believe EVERYTHING is my fault. No one else's. I torture myself with every little mistake I make. Even if, black and white, the other person is wrong, I will find a way to twist it and make it my fault. I carry with me even the slightest but if guilt and I'm unable to forgive myself for the silliest little things.

"dz6nds4","&gt;Merrill was being selfish and reckless no matter how you spin it. 

She wasn't the one who decided to let a demon possess her without telling anyone. She brings Hawke along and says ""look I know the risks, kill me if it goes wrong"". That's the opposite of being reckless. But when she gets there, the choice was made for her. We don't know what would've happened if Marethari hadn't done what she did. We don't even know if the demon was originally a spirit, though I can't say more on that without going into big Inquisition spoilers.

It's also worth noting that her motivation is anything but ""selfish"". Dalish elves are, first and foremost about preserving what they've lost and trying to piece together their past.

"dz5f5wi","&gt;Ive never once seen a mod in any of the other hockey subs start throwing out warnings just because someone has a dissenting opinion

It's not just the dissenting opinion, it's the whole package. It's a potentially inflammatory subject in a thread primed to go in a very contentious direction, and you were posting multiple places in the thread. Look, experience has told me that that's a recipe for some bullshit that I'll have to deal with and I'd rather come across as strict and issue the warning early and potentially head off any possible problems, or if problems *do* arise, I can say ""look man, you were warned"".

This is not me singling you out - I've done this for dozens of people, caps fans included. Usually they just say ""you're right, I'll keep it civil"" or something along those lines and it prevents anything.

&gt;Oh okay it wasnt my flair, you just knew what team I cheer for. thats not much better lol. And where the hell did I say I was surprised that I have the dissenting opinion? I'm not surprised at all, this is a Caps sub first, hockey sub second

It's pointing out that you need to phrase things less antagonistically. This sub isn't for chirping, it isn't for insinuating our players are worthless goons, it isn't for opposing fans to get on their own soapbox about our team. It's first and foremost for Caps fans, just like every team sub.

&gt;because if I deserved a random warning after having done nothing wrong I dont see whats wrong with giving you one too

you were downvoted to oblivion and had a half dozen reports on your comments all over the thread - that's going to catch my attention, and it's very often going to result in the person lashing out at some point. The points are all imaginary, but people lose their shit over them, and I'd rather head it off at the pass and be wrong than wait and have someone post bullshit where I have to nuke a thread.

If I'd found anything you said worthy of a ban, you'd have just been banned. I've said it time and again. I also posted my comment in response and preemptively before reading each of your comments because it's easier to post the warning immediately before someone has a chance to post more, and then check the rest in the mean time.

&gt;I have behaved like a guest, as far as I'm aware, I havent broken a single rule. Its just not often that you walk into someones home and the first thing they say is ""I know you havent done anything wrong just know if you make one misstep Im kicking you out"". You are a host! act like it ;)

You can not break explicit rules and still be a bad guest. Posting things designed to get a rise out of people in a thread where emotions are already going to run high falls under that.

&gt;I see you skipped the link

I see you edited the link in...

let me break them down:

* Schenn Hit - Boarding? sure, but he at least had a hearing, and DOPS released a video explicitly to explain why further discipline wasn't warranted.
* Visnovsky Hit - Wilson comes in fast and Visnovsky is crouched reaching for a puck. He misses it, and so it could technically be interference, but most times it isn't called because typically when a guy is just about to touch the puck they give a little leeway. Wilson doesn't jump, and the head is the primary point of contact, but Visnovsky being bent over provides no possible target to be hit without head contact. If you want to argue it *should* be a suspendable hit, then the rulebook needs to change (which, for the record, I think it does. I think *most* of Wilson's hits on this list are extremely dangerous and reckless, but are *juuust* barely inside the letters of the rulebook to avoid penalty/suspension. The rules need to be adjusted.)
* Campbell hit - This one is another clear penalty, but not suspension worthy. The player is at a ~90 degree angle to the curved boards when Wilson is approaching, but when he reaches to chip the puck, his left shoulder turns toward the boards. The question now entirely becomes: Should the Stralman hit be a suspension? The league says no to that, so I'd have to argue no to this (the validity of that is up for debate, but more on that later)
* Lazar hit - this one is just a flat out joke. *Please* watch it if you haven't because it's so comically not even a penalty. If you think it is, *please* try to break that down, because it... it just isn't.
* Sheary knee-on-knee - Already discussed. I think a fine is justified, I think a suspension is overboard.
* Moore hit - Moore peeks over his shoulder and sees Wilson coming. He does not brace himself along the boards for any contact, but leaves himself in a vulnerable position to make himself unhittable. Onus is on Wilson here to let up, and he didn't. The result was terrible, but the legality/suspendability of a play isn't determined by the result - that only factors into *length* of suspension.. But again, this hit will be relevant shortly.
* Thomas hit - SUSPENSION - If it hadn't been late it's not even a penalty. It *was* late and the league decided to crack down. There is a LOT more evidence of hits like this not being suspensions than there are of them being suspensions, but it's a new year, and the league is wanting to crack down, so it's a preseason suspension. Fine - if that's how DOPS will consistently act from now on (narrator: *they won't*)
* Blais hit - SUSPENSION - ok, so I said pick one from *before* he'd been suspended, so this shouldn't count, but... look at it. It's the same hit as the one Stralman laid, except Wilson stayed on his feet and didn't lift his elbow in his hit. It's very similar to the Lazar hit and the Moore hit. Right now I'm looking at 3-1 no suspension to suspension. I can accept that if the movement is in the direction of cracking down consistently, but with Stralman getting nothing, we've now flip flopped and *that's* what has everyone so up in arms. If the league wants to start cracking down, fine, but they damn well better start doing it to everyone and not just Wilson, because after the Stralman hit, that's sure what it looks like.


If you look at each of those hits on their own and not as one collective ""Wilson is the Devil"" group of hits, they're each borderline because of the grey areas provided by the rulebook. And that's the point - I'm not claiming Wilson hasn't laid dangerous hits. I *do* think most of these hits should be taken out of the game with suspensions, but with the rules as they're written these aren't quite suspendable.",1526588989,"i think *most* of wilson's hits on this list are extremely dangerous and reckless, but are *juuust* barely inside the letters of the rulebook to avoid penalty/suspension.","dangerous and reckless","reckless",NA,FALSE,"extremely dangerous and reckless","dangerous",NA,"extremely",0

My point isnt to be a ""pick one"" like OP suggests - it's that drinking and driving and bareback sex with multiple partners both have public health concerns and are seen as generally stupid behavior. I figured the bareback scenario would be more relatable to the sub since we're a bunch of gay dudes and has a tendency to be a volatile subject. My thought is that it's easy to dismount someone's decision or thought process as the most idiotic when you aren't a factor and to establish a moral high ground. From a public health standpoint, bareback with different partners is a huge risk and irresponsible, allowing for various STIs to mutate, spread quickly, and cause complications for others. The one benefit to bareback sex is self pleasure - which I'm essentially comparing to drinking and driving. I can call both of these actions selfish and reckless, but in the end, am I going to make that person stop their behavior?

What/who do they lead? Auaran Empire

What're they like? Strong and just, sometimes reckless but really smart.

What do people think of them? Free citizens loved Elezia. She conquered Kiio Archipelago and brought many goods and slaves to the empire.

Backstory: Elezia was firstborn doughter of Emperror Teano Tienej III but her brother and sister siezed the power after her father mysterious death. Assasins were sent to kill her but she escaped due to the sacrifice of royal guards loyal to her. She went to Quala and got support (she promised to marry prince of Quala).

With Quala forces and her loyalists her army sieged Tamelan. She got to the city thru the canals and provided weapons for slaves and promised some of them freedom. After few days the gates of Tamelan were opened and her army marched into the city. After that she executed her siblings on the stage of Grand Slave Market.

5 years after this events she was given a Falrai (Niv) slave from a slaver who claimed that he sailed to the massive landmass in the east. This small boy had great magic talent. She tought him arcane arts. One day this slave left the palace with Aya the Emperres blade (during the night). He saw how other slaves were treated and started to plot to free the slaves. He cooperated with Talos, leader of first slave rebellion. Niv had to flee becouse the rebellion failed. When he was trying to convince Skorpyrans Four Chieftains to help there was second Slave Rebellion in Tamelan. Talos was siezed and executed by Elezia. After 2 years when United Skorpyran Army sieged Tamelan Third Slave Rebellion started. After slaves escaped the city (this slaves funded Iros) Niv engaged Elezia in combat. Emerres lost only becouse Niv had a powerfull artifact. Niv overloaded the Sandwell and teleported away. The well exploded killing Emperres, destroying the city and killing ale that were in it.

"dxae3wh","&gt; Which champs do you ban or recommend buying Doran’s shield against?

I always ban Darius or Jax, always prioritize Darius first. His bleed and true damage (especially with conquerors existing) is disgusting and will destroy your advantage as an early game champion. Jax is somewhat manageable, but his scaling can potentially contribute more to his team than you, but it all depends. 

As for Doran's Shield, I never get that as I feel taking Bone Plating and Chrysalis in your secondary rune slots will suffice in trading/taking damage. You might as well start with something that you can easily build upon and get yourself out of laning phase if you need to.

&gt; How do you transition to mid/ late game. (Do you continue split pushing top like a trynd all game or do you group with teammates even if you’re ahead)

This is I would say, somewhat situational? But ultimately it is a yes to split pushing and playing laning phase majority of the game. Although his ult is great in team fighting your kit I personally think it was meant for dueling 1v1s or 1v2s. This ""selfish"" style of play has the potential to create a huge advantage for your team in the sense that they know they can take other objectives simultaneously (assuming that they can hold their own) and a huge threat for the enemy team in terms of strong top lane presence and that one of their team will always have to defend from you(and in most often times if you have the right timing they tend to fail at defending.). This easily transitions to the answer of your next question!

&gt; Ignite or teleport and why?
In the early game, you will most likely trade a lot in lane and you will get low quite frequently. It is important while doing so that you don't miss the CS, most importantly the exp.

As I had mentioned previously, although you should keep your lane extremely pressured, it is also important to not forget that you have four other team mates trying to get objectives as well! If you take teleport, your rotations to split pushing and grouping for objectives will be a lot easier. If you are a game sense god and have all the objective timers and think that you will be able to group with the team when it is necessary without TP then take ignite by all means (this takes a greater amount of game decision making, or macro-play, as they say). But just having TP at hand makes rotating a lot easier from splitting to group objectives.

&gt; I played Xin top vs a GP today and I walked all over him, but I imagine an enemy like Camille or Renekton is a different story?

This is an excellent observation, and I will let you know that at this point of playing Xin Zhao in ranked, you better just pray that they won't pick it at all, you beg you jungler for ganks, or that Camille / Renekton player is worse than you. Sorry this is horrible advice but it just boils down to your own mechanics / macroplay! Lots of advice givers when it comes to playing against hard champ matchups say that ""Oh just play safe and get out of laning ASAP"" and of course that is a valid point but there's just times where you will just get smashed and grouping with the team (that may or may not be feeding) will just make things worse. So this is what I do (which is extremely reckless but worth a shot) : If you do reach a hard match up and you get smashed / go even, just keep playing lane and keep that pressure so that although you wont be grouping as much as your team, your enemy top laner won't be able to contribute to their team as much either. I don't really beg my jungler for ganks as I feel that I am confident in my own independent scaling and my team that I will do my part in keeping up, while the jungler can push my mid / bot further to success.

These are all very rough answers and completely from my perspective of the game and how I play XZ. Feel free to question it and provide feedback as I am also still learning how to play the game.

I'd like to think Mulan would be Gryffindor because what she did took great courage. Yes, she is resourceful and cunning but wasn't as concerned about self-preservation and did something incredibly reckless that required immense bravery.  Yes, she possesses Slytherin traits but I feel like her Gryffindor traits where dominant. 

Belle is also Gryffindor, imo, for similar reasons. Instead of saving herself she took her fathers place as The Beast's prisoner.  That takes bravery and is great example of self-sacrifice. Ya, she loves to read/learn and has Ravenclaw traits but again, I feel her Gryffindor traits where dominant.

I'd like to think Snow White would be Hufflepuff. She cares greatly for her friends and all creatures. Lot of loyalty.

Ariel would be a Ravenclaw for reasons a poster above gave that I agree with. Her curiosity drove her. And well she is definitely brave her thirst for learning is what really drives that bravery. She may not be the brightest either, but she is always wanting to learn. (maybe Gryffindor via note at bottom) 

Pocahontas would be Ravenclaw (again because I agree with a poster above). Like Ariel, her thirst for learning is what drives her. She is very brave as well but its because she wants to learn. 

Megara (Meg) isn't what she appears. She looks to be a Slytherin because she was working with the bad guy (Hades) but what people forget is why she is. She sold her soul to Hades to bring the love of her life back. Her love then ran off with another woman and she had nothing and now was bound to Hades. After she met Hercules she fell in love again and despite hesitation ended up sacrificing herself for him. She has a great loyalty for those she loves and that is why I'd place her in Hufflepuff.

Aurora...thb its been a long time since I've seen that movie so I cant analyze as much but I could swear she was pretty bland as a character and I don't remember anything remarkable about her so I would place her in Hufflepuff because thats where those the other houses don't accept go (not the only reason why ppl go to Hufflepuff but ONE of the reasons so no offense Hufflepuffs!!!!) 

Cinderella...It has also been years since I've seen the movie so I apologize to any fans. Everything she did in that story was for herself. Granted, she had a shit family and she is not a bad person but she did lie to get her way technically. She was no princess but was able to charm a prince via magical ways. She escaped her horrible life for something better but it was all for herself. I'd say she was a soft-spoken Slytherin.

Jasmine is a strong and independent princess. She would leave the castle and disobey her father. She was not afraid to speak her mind or stand up to Jafar. I'd call her a solid Gryffindor.

Rapunzel is very curious about the world. She wants to learn like Ariel. I feel like she is more a Gryffindor however. Despite similarities to Ariel and Pocahontas I feel that Rapunzel is a bit more reckless. Her curiosity doesn't stem or cause her wanting of knowledge in the same way as Ariel. Ariel always wants to learn, she goes above land she is excited at every new experience. Rapunzel however, seemed to seek more adventure than actual knowledge. 

Anna is for sure a Gryffindor. A bit heard headed, naive, but loves her sister very much. She makes dumb decisions and is reckless but is not afraid to right the wrong and go on an adventure. Very brave. All the things for Gryffindor. 

Elsa is a Gryffindor like her sister. She loves her sister very much and wants to protect her and the kingdom. She is cold to her to protect her in the only way she knew how. She eventually grew and overcame the fear of her powers and embraces them. Reminds me of Neville.

Esmerelda, well not technically a princess I'll include cause why not, I kinda feel shes a slytherin. She is very cunning. Very fiery personality. Defies Follo and avoids capture. She ultimately does whats right but I feel she cares the most about herself. She may be a  Gryffindor in bravery but I wanna say Slytherin so not all princesses are Gryffindor.

These are all the Disney movies with Princesses I've seen. I know I've left some out but I haven't seen a lot of the newer ones so I cant give an opinion.

Regarding my reasoning for my sorting I like to think it goes more deeper than ""Belle likes books ergo she's Ravenclaw"" The world, these characters, and the houses aren't as black and white as that. We must also remember you can have traits of multiple houses, again the world is not as black and white as that. Hermione is smart, loves to learn but its a tool for her not a driving force. Peter Pettigrew was a coward and cared for himself only but he admired courage and desired it and was incredibly brave for anyone he counted as a protector/master.

No brake checking someone isn’t a valid reason to physically harm and injure them. 

Does that make it okay? Of course not. But if this were the US the truckers would be in serious shit.

It’s dangerous and reckless, but if you rear end them you’d still be at fault in some cases.

"dvsnwg8","Alright, most of these display a ridiculous lack of understanding of firearms but many are more bizarre and embarrassing than misleading. Understand I am not particularly well versed in gun terminology but I'm aware of the difference between a bullet and a shell, a clip and a magazine, etc. Trying to research many of the statements just lead me to a ""top X stupid things liberals said about guns"" results. This doesn't put your list in a favorable light, but I will try to look at it fairly.

&gt;“Well, you know, my shotgun will do better for you than your AR-15, because you want to keep someone away from your house, just fire the shotgun through the door.” 

Biden is making an admitted odd statement trying to suggest that a shotgun is a better deterrent for home safety than an AR-15. His example is bizarre and reckless but doesn't appear to be designed to misinform anyone. I would argue that the important part of his statement is that a shotgun is better for home safety than an assault rifle. My mother would likely agree because she strongly believes her 40-year-old unloaded double-barrel shotgun once saved her from a home invasion because it is so intimidating. I don't see you debunking the intention of his statement, though I honestly have no idea if either is objectively better for such purposes.

&gt;“Some of these bullets, as you saw, have an incendiary device on the tip of it, which is a heat seeking device. So, you don’t shoot deer with a bullet that size. If you do you could cook it at the same time.”

Heat seeking bullets is obviously just flat out wrong. From my understanding, there are explosive/incendiary ammunition but I'd always thought they were more for artillery and large caliber (anti armor and such) and not smaller arms. I've heard of tracers potentially starting fires in flammable materials but obviously they couldn't cook an animal. What was the context of the statement? I saw a very very short clip of the statement and it looked like they had a rather large caliber rifle on display (.50 cal maybe?). My understanding is that there **was** larger caliber incendiary ammo, and using a .50 cal rifle to hunt deer matches the part of her statement when she says ""So, you don’t shoot deer with a bullet that size."" Either way, I've never heard of heat seeking bullets (extremely high-tech guided .50 cal sniper rounds on some tech show, but that was likely well after she made that statement in 2007). I would say she was objectively wrong about the heat-seeking part. Again, what was the purpose of her statement or the action that her statement was supporting? Was she objecting to this ammunition? To .50 cal rifles?

&gt;“This is a ghost gun. This right here has the ability with a .30-caliber clip to disperse with 30 bullets within half a second. Thirty magazine clip in half a second.”

I found this on a [right-leaning website](https://www.theblaze.com/news/2014/01/21/anti-gun-senator-is-being-mocked-relentlessly-after-he-warned-of-30-caliber-clip-in-embarrassing-video) ""According to the Associated Press, the rifle on display in the video is indeed a homemade fully automatic rifle. Still, a rate of fire of 60 rounds per second — or 3,600 rounds per minute — is unlikely with a 'homemade' rifle."" Obviously the dude either bungled or didn't understand the terms. Very embarrassing, but as per the aforementioned website his argument was supporting this:

""Under de Leon’s measure, SB808 would allow the manufacture or assembly of homemade weapons, known as 'ghost guns,', but require the makers to first apply to the state Department of Justice for a serial number that would be given only after the applicants undergo a background check. De Leon plans to amend the bill to also require that guns contain permanent pieces of metal that could be detected by X-ray machines and metal detectors.""

Which doesn't sound unreasonable. I agree that his statements are objectively wrong, but since he bungled virtually every term in his statement I can't honestly assume his statement was purposely misleading. I don't think he believes he needs to lie to convince people to regulate the home-manufacturing of something that is already illegal.

&gt;“What’s the efficacy of banning these magazine clips? I will tell you… these are ammunition, they’re bullets. So the people who have those now, they’re going to shoot them, so if you ban them in the future, the number of these high capacity magazines is going to decrease dramatically over time because the bullets will have been shot and there won’t be any more available.”

I agree she has no idea what she is talking about, but ""there won’t be any more available because they've all been shot"" is not the only argument against high capacity magazines. She specifically should either learn more about what she's talking about or get better advisers. Her justification is admittedly stupid and incorrect.

&gt;“We lose 93 million Americans a day to gun violence.”

Agree 100%. Laughably inaccurate and she even doubled down on it.  Very embarrassing. 

&gt;“We have federal regulations and state laws that prohibit hunting ducks with more than three rounds. And yet it’s legal to hunt humans with 15-round, 30-round, even 150-round magazines.”

You are purposely misinterpreting her emphasis. I would argue with **absolute confidence** that she is fully aware that it is not legal to hunt humans. Her point is that duck hunting laws/regulations recognize the low number of bullets required to hunt ducks and finds it difficult to justify magazines with exponentially larger capacities under the umbrella of hunting. Clearly, her point is that these larger magazines make it easier to commit acts of gun violence without having to reload. She is simply stretching to make a poor comparison to duck hunting. I imagine the laws regarding the legal hunting of other wild animals does not impose a similar three round limit so it's not a great point even with the poor phrasing.

&gt;Most of these politicians obviously have zero knowledge about the actual guns they’re trying to ban.

Most politicians have very little knowledge about **MOST** of the laws they are debating and passing. Nobody can be knowledgeable about everything - a reality I myself struggle against regularly. This is the same for the general population. I agree that some of your examples demonstrate the lack of understanding, but I don't see the malice or deliberate intention to misinform.

&gt;Mayor Bloomberg said pistols were ok since they only shoot one bullet each time you pull the trigger. He said AR15s were not ok because they keep shooting when you hold down the trigger.

This is honestly the most damning quote you've given because it seems either deliberately misleading or shows a fundamental lack of knowledge concerning existing regulations (assuming this statement was made well after the ban of automatic weapons and was an argument against ARs vs other types of firearms). This is also assuming he's not referring to an AR-15 with a bump fire stock (something I did look into recently and is a compelling concern, in my opinion).

&gt;I have yet to hear an argument from any gun grabbing politician that is based in fact and logic. They only make emotional arguments.

"du5mvah","None of that stuff shat on it. Butcher was literally just another personal monster for Travis based on the implication that he was a serial killer or at least had a psychotic streak in his past and had nothing to do with Pyramid Head. The mirrors merely expanded on the lore and doesn't break anything. I've seen so many debates where people try to say Origins breaks canon but all the arguments ever amount to is ""I don't like that stuff so it's non-canon!!!!11!1"" or imply that since it wasn't in the original (like mirrors) that somehow it's just flat out impossible for it to have ever existed or something?

Regarding characters, I never bought anybody was ruined. Kaufmann was an irredeemable asshole in SH1, and still is here. Lisa was mildly flirty and affectionate in the original and we already knew she had a history as a drug abuser in the original, so those aspects of her character are played up in SH0. Note that in the original she was effectively already dead but just didn't know it, whereas in Origins she is younger and more reckless but still actually alive. 

Finally Alessa is portrayed as being somewhat smug and is flat out using Travis for her own gain, but people only have an issue with this because for some reason they felt she was a Mary Sue in the original game who was benevolent, when in reality the only thing she wanted above all else was to permanently die so she couldn't suffer anymore. She shows nothing but antipathy towards Harry in spite of the fact that he poses no threat to her and was technically already the father of her other half. Her literal goal in SH1 was to spread the crest around the town enough to destroy the whole town, which was stopped by Harry whilst he was being lied to and manipulated by Dahlia. 

So in Origins she is once again using Harry as a means to an end, she was never some benevolent person who wanted to save the town or anyone else, she only wanted to be freed from the torture Dahlia and the cult put her through.

It looks like Tobo was very tired and reckless, but it doesn't explain how Aridatha and his associates managed to be unaffected by the sleep-spell. I doubt that was possible without sorcery, but there isn't much sorcerers around at that point.

So it was the destruction of Kina that knocked out Lady and Booboo? Very interesting, somehow I've totally missed it. BTW there's also some information in chapter 137.

I suspected that Sedvod was killed by Khadidas, but could not figure out what was the motive. Just to deny one more sorcerer to the Black Company? If I recall correctly Sedvod was actually not very eager to cooperate.

In chapter 103 Lady says that Kina may be preventing them from contacting Sahra's spirit. Now I have a theory that Sahra's death was also somehow caused by Kina.

"dtl62bu","This is a really interesting idea that I actually really like. The only major complaint I can think of is depending on how the rest of the system is made, there is a chance that individuals turns may slow down a lot simply due to the number of dice being rolled. 

That being said, I do have some ideas that could be implemented. 

For one, I think if you rolled two equidistant numbers on Cautious, it counts as 11. However, if on reckless it should either be randomly determined between the two or they roll a third die and whatever that one is is what they get. That way, it still fits in with the theme of Cautious is closer to Average and Reckless can be anywhere. 

However, if you're going to have there be something for a tied roll, I think it would also be really cool if you gave something for rolling doubles. Off the top of my head, I'd probably just have it add the two numbers together and make that your effective roll. I'd probably also say that if this new roll is over 20, it still counts as a critical hit (Assuming your system has that). Hypothetically, you could also give a bigger bonus for bigger numbers, like say over 20 counts as x2 damage, over 30 is x3, and 40, since it is so astronomically low to actually get, is x5. You could also say if you rolled a double and the combination is still under 10, it's a critical failure. Hypothetically, you could also limit the under 10 failure to just when using Reckless, but it's up to you. 

Something else to think about is the possibility that as the players get to higher levels, they could unlock the ability to use more than two dice at a time. Again, I'm just spit-balling here, but instead of gaining extra attacks like in 3.5/pathfinder, you could have it so they throw extra dice. That could clear up the hypothetical problem I brought up earlier where I worried about multiple attacks bogging down combat. To be honest though, I wouldn't know how balanced throwing three or maybe even four dice on a roll would be, especially if we had bonuses for rolling doubles.

"dtjzdyg","&gt; Does it seem like just a coincidence to you that the economy is always better than when it started after a democrat is president and always worse after a republican?

Which democrat are you referring to? Was it Clinton, who during the latter part of his presidency had the tech crash? Or was it Obama, who had almost his entire presidency fueled with extremely low rates from the Fed? Does it surprise you Trump has had a better economy while the Fed has raised rates?

&gt; These are the same type of tax cuts in Kansas that led to record deficits, no economic growth and proof that tax cuts for the rich only benefit the rich.

I'm not familiar with what happened in Kansas, but it's not difficult to understand how tax cuts are not pro-growth. Tax cuts give people more money, which influences consumer spending.

&gt; Nearly every non-partisan economic group says that the new tax plan will add 1.5 trillion to America's debt and at best the resulting economic growth would only cover 1/3rd of the cost.

Source for this claim? The articles I've read so far covering the bill v. deficit won't account for economic growth, as it is too difficult to predict. If economic growth is stagnant, I agree with you. However, I think we can both agree these policies influence growth, but to what degree? Will we see a consistent 2.5%, or even a consistent 3%, perhaps? Only time will tell.

"dt85erp","You and I watched very different movies.

To me, the original trilogy was a story about a boy who is impulsive and reckless but strong in the Force.

He constantly acts without thinking, he needs to learn patience and learn to listen to the Force for guidance. He arrogantly thinks he can defeat Vader without finishing his training but he is wrong.

Then in RotJ, he has spent 3 years since the last movie training and growing. He now walks slowly and deliberately. He now speaks matter of factly. He seems to ponder his decisions before making them. Han seems super surprised that Luke is the one who came up with a complicated plan to free him.

Luke comes up with a plan that is 3 layers deep. Contingencies on top of contingencies. The kind of thing that old impulsive Luke never would have done. He gives Jabba every chance to turn Han over without violence or bloodshed, turning to violence only as a last resort.

All of his friends seem to show him deference now since it seems in the last 3 years he's proven that he's become wise.

He goes to talk to Vader because he has a feeling that he will turn back to the light side. The Force (especially the future) is often feelings. He has learned to trust in the will of the Force and do what it wants rather than follow his own desires. During the process, the Emperor and Vader both taunt him and try to bring him to the Dark Side and he resists their taunting for a long time before it has any effect on him and then it starts to have an effect but before he can follow through on his fall, he stops and realizes when he is doing. He makes a huge breakthrough and realizes that he doesn't need his anger. That's not who he is. He needs to let it go, once and for all. He needs to trust that the Force will protect him and guide him to the right path, not his lightsaber. That's when he drops his lightsaber and says ""You've failed, your highness. I am a Jedi like my father before me."" Before that moment, he wasn't a Jedi, he was just a Jedi in training and had yet to fully understand what the Force expected of him. Then the Emperor seems to stop for a second and sense his mind. He realizes the truth of Luke's words. He has finally purged the last of his anger and hatred. Luke saw his father laying on the ground and he pitied him, not hated him. Luke would no longer be turned. Ever. So the Emperor says ""So be it, Jedi"" and lightning bolts him in order to finish him off. And his trust in the Force pays off. Vader does turn and destroys the Emperor. 

He finally learns to let his own hatred, anger, ego, and selfish desires go and to serve.

As a side note, the color you wear has nothing to do with whether you are a sith or not. Also, officially in canon he used a confusion effect against the Gamorrean guards. he didn't choke them. It was a kind of mind trick.

Also, the dark side comes from Anger, Fear, Aggression. Jedi are allowed to kill and fight. They just need to do so from a place of peace and calm. When at Jabba's Palace, that was the point. He calmly explained to Jabba that he was now powerful enough to beat him and that it was for the best if he just listened to him and resolved the situation without bloodshed. He disagreed, so Luke did what he had to. Not because he hated Jabba or wanted him dead, but because that was the only way to free Han. 

&gt;started his own Jedi Academy, but failed miserably, lost his nephew to the dark side, all his students killed or likewise lost to the darkside, billions of people dead as a result (which he can feel through the force, btw - he was there for all of it).

This one confuses me. He started an Academy because he wanted to pass on Yoda's teachings. He seemed to be doing just fine training them. That's a win. Kylo turning wasn't his failure. It was Kylo's. But the movie made us feel like it was his so we could feel his guilt over it.

As for billions of people dying. That happened WAY later, it was done by the First Order using a big planet killing base. Kylo didn't even do that, though he was there for it. Even then, Luke was long gone and had cut himself off from the Force by then. It wasn't his fault other than he didn't try to stop it.

Of course, all of that happening is kind of my point. Luke isn't the kind of person who gives up. If Kylo turned, he should have been working to bring him back. He should have been looking to the Force for guidance and finding a way to stop him. He didn't do any of that stuff. He gave up but only because a poor author wrote him badly.

After the second Death Star, Luke had like 20 years worth of adventures before the whole Kylo thing.

"dt069ao","There are two parts to every monster: its attacks and its defense. Its attacks are going to be known to the PCs because they'll see them happen, but they won't know its defenses. With that in mind, we don't need to worry too much about its HP, just its attacks and AC.

While you don't know exactly what kind of tricks your PCs may have up their sleeves when on attack, you know what they defend like. With that, you can estimate how many turns it will take to bring each of them to 0 hit points. For example, if one of them has an AC of 15 and 30 HP, and you give your enemy a +6 to attack and 2d6+4 to its attacks, you can estimate that the PC will go down in about 5 turns (average 11 damage per hit, hitting 60% of the time, gives an average of 6.6 damage per turn). I would probably place a challenging encounter with the enemy being able to take down each PC in about 2 turns if it really focused. Obviously it'll take more to take down a Barbarian than a Wizard, but you can still find a happy medium between these two. 

Finally, AC. You know what your PCs to-hit bonuses are. If you want a fight to feel like they're doing a lot, give them a 60% chance to hit but then a ton of HP to your enemy guy. If you want them to feel like this foe is very skilled, give them about a 40% chance to hit but lower health to the enemy. Each number on the d20 is an additional 5% chance to hit, so a 40% chance to hit means they'd need to roll a 13 before their bonus.

From there, just assess the situation to figure out HP. Has combat been going on for a while? Just take a mental note that the enemy will survive for two more turns of solid hits. Half the party is down? Same thing: set a turn limit to the number of solid hits he'll need to go down. The party isn't using enough resources to your liking? Boom, enemy has more HP and in desperation is using more reckless but heavier attacks. They just cast Hold Monster and you can't make a Wisdom save to save your life? He's going to use a Legendary Resistance.

"drxdbdz","tl;dr To be able to make up a story, rationalize it in her head, and then convince herself she is correct.

She was new to the school. This was our second year of law school and she just transferred in. It can be tough to make friends, especially when transferring into a hyper competitive environment full of type-a personalities. I took it upon myself to become friends with her and introduce her to people.
We quickly became friends, and she asked to hang just about every day. She was a cool girl and had an interesting insight into life, so I enjoyed her company and spent portions of almost every day with her.
Her first mistake was driving drunk. She was never a big drinker in undergrad, so drinking was new to her. Being the lawyer in training she was, she refused any sobriety tests and got an attorney. The attorney got the charge dropped to a reckless operation of a vehicle. This entailed getting her license suspended for six months. She was able to get driving privileges which allowed her to drive to ""school and doctors appointments"" only. 
The day before her suspension was up, she was busted for driving outside her privileges. I got a frantic call at 10pm, hysterical, claiming the cops are out to get her. In between the sobbing, I was able to figure out where she was. I went to pick her up. I asked her where she was coming from, she said the gym. ""But the gym is not part of your privileges?"" ""I know, but I didn't think it was a big deal.""
And that statement, ""I know, but I didn't think it was a big deal,"" opened my eyes like Moses parting the Red Sea. This is a woman, who wants to be a criminal defense attorney--the type of attorney where clients put their lives in your hands. I realized she was not just reckless, but stupid. How can you keep a criminal out of death row if you can't even learn the full scope of your driving privileges? 
Now the night she got busted for violating her privileges, my sisters and I were at a concert for a band that has not toured, or released an album in 12 years: this was their first show back. I waited all summer for this, and she knew how excited I was for this concert. The band didn't even make it halfway through their set when she demanded I come get her. For some reason, she decided an Uber couldn't pick her up.
The next 4 months showed a pattern of behavior similar to a sociopath, but a stupid one. Since her reckless op charge, and her privileges violation, she blamed everyone--from the other drivers on the road, to the cops, to the prosecutors, to her attorney not knowing what they were doing--for what happened. She never once accepted blame, that maybe she was at fault. I realized she had an inability to be incorrect, no matter how far-fetched her arguments got. 
She told me she was a loser in highschool, that bloomed into the ""hot girl"" in college. It became clear to me that she still carried this resentment around with her, this need to always be defensive to protect herself. She clearly developed this in high school. I should have seen the warning signs. She never spoke about any of her friends from high school, undergrad, or her previous law school. The only time she ever spoke about it, was when she told me her undergrad roommate stopped being friends with her because she (my friend) was too difficult. Whenever she would fly back home, she never hung out with any friends, only her boyfriend and her two younger brothers.
When we would go out on the town, she started dabbling in drugs. She was causing problems--breaking up relationships, causing drama, being a problem to be around. Others started noticing.
I sat her down, explained all this to her, and told her she needs to cut out the drugs. ""You're going down a bad path,"" is what I told her. She flipped, absolutely lost her mind. She found every way in the book to say she wasn't the problem: I was. Her inability to be wrong cut so deep into her personality, she made up that my girlfriend told me I couldn't be friends with her. Put words in my girlfriend's mouth and started spreading rumors about me. The funny part is that my girlfriend was friends with her, and never once said anything negative about this girl.
To be able to make up a story, rationalize it in her head, and then convince herself she is correct, was something I never experienced before. I cut that off, lost her never ending problems she would put on me, and feel so much better and relaxed. She still runs her mouth, but I have a killer reputation, and all her new ""friends"" cut her off and thanked me for trying to help her. I never once spoke about her, or the conversation we had to anyone. That's not my style. She pissed on her own name by trying to drag mine through the mud. I'm not here to stroke my ego or dangle my cock. But I'm a genuinely good person and treat everyone I know with the respect they deserve. Everyone I go to school with knows this about me. Her sheer stupidity to try to take me down turned everyone we go to school with against her.
Moral of the story, you just can't help stupid. I tried, and it was way more headache  than it was worth.
From what I know, she got the partying thing in control and is somewhat successful.

"drwmbug","You haven't really said much about your character. The circumstances of your character's birth and her mother's death could inform your character's values, personality or partly explain her motivation to seek adventure, but until you decide _how_, the backstory you've developed so far will be of fairly limited value.

The way I see it, background and backstory is kind of only useful to the extent that it provides guidance and inspiration for creating a personality and motivation for your character. And it _can_ be very useful for that.

But the surest way to make sure your character isn't boring is to have her act boldly, and to make her multidimensional.

To act boldly, do your best to pay attention to what's happening in the game (including the actions of your fellow PCs) and look for opportunities to behave heroically and raise the stakes. Don't _try_ to be stupid and reckless, but don't be afraid to make mistakes either. If your actions introduce complications for you or your party, that's a good thing.

To be multidimensional, start with one dimension -- a surface quality that's easy for you to play and is easy for others to notice. This could be relentless cheerfulness or grumpiness. It could be greediness or an almost overbearing degree of care and compassion.

Adding another quality or two (perhaps more subtle ones) will add more dimension, but what can _really_ help is to adopt a quality that seems incongruous with your character's surface personality, or values/goals. Maybe you're cheerful but cynical... or you're very open-minded and tolerant with one glaring exception.

In general, while you play, do stuff and have your character react strongly to things. It's less important that you know why your character is doing interesting, entertaining and heroic things and more important that you just do them. You can come up with motivations to explain your behavior after the fact and maybe create a great backstory in the process, but the most beautifully crafted backstory in the world means little if you're passive at the table.",1514550269,"don't _try_ to be stupid and reckless, but don't be afraid to make mistakes either.","stupid and reckless","reckless",NA,FALSE,"stupid and reckless","stupid",NA,NA,0

Oh, right.  He wasn't just disliked in the military.  His own soldiers wanted to kill him themselves.

Explains a lot about why he really isn't what I'd consider a fellow soldier.  He brings a good deal of shame to us all by the fact he probably only didn't get washed out at West Point because this was the conscript era where a broomstick that could hold an M16 could have been worth throwing into the killing fields of Vietnam, just for some extra meat to catch a round when a sandbag wasn't around to do the same job.

I'm borderline believing we'd all been better off if he'd suddenly found a frag in his lap one night.

Most of you will find the terribly vulgar and offensive, but I suspect Mueller, a vaunted Marine commander during Vietnam, who this sub is about, probably has the same thoughts he'll keep to himself to preserve his influence.

""At times I can be a fair bit unstable and reckless, but I'm not ""a fucking idiot"" as half+ of /r/bitcoin would probably respond, right before they downvoted. I don't know why I'm even posting anything, to be honest. I guess discovering the impetus to tell at least part of your story is natural at this point.

My first BitInstant transaction to MtGox was exactly one year ago today, 2/28/2013. 4 of them, $480.05 each into my Gox acct. How poignant it was to wake up to the news (not that it was wholly unexpected). Kind of funny to think of my mindset at the time, now. It's like...I wasn't totally wrong, but I guess I was wrong enough. I ended up spending just shy of $40,000 over the month of March last year.

I have a thousand and two thoughts right now. The primary thought being that all I have to my name now are some shares of CaVirtex, some shares of N&amp;B, some peercoins, and a couple thousand dollars. Primary or not, I suppose my thoughts don't matter at this point.

It was a fun ride, though. I had more fun and genuine engagement over the last year with the Bitcoin community than I have had with basically anything else in my life during that time. It's funny, I knew I was facing a $250k+ loss the other day, but I was so excited about the few hundred dollars I made on N&amp;B, lol. The totals are just numbers on the screen. It's about the trade, and the rapid amalgamation of various sources of data. It's about the extrinsic, objective gratification of knowing whether you were right, or wrong, as told through the market. It's about going against yourself, weighing your odds. It's about striving for perfection, knowing you will never reach it...this market is the best game I've ever played. For all the caustic denigration traders still receive in the larger Bitcoin community, I'll state that greed is not at all about wanting more than you have. Greed is wanting more than you need. It's a differentiation that, I think, is quite overlooked. I do have a mighty thorn in my paw about how the community handled all of this, but it's not worth it to address that now.

Like any breakdown, there is blame to go around, and I certainly hold a good part of it when it comes to my current predicament. I still believe in Bitcoin. If I had any money left to reinvest, I...might. I knew the risk I was taking (I thought), and I even considered losses down to 50%. I considered near-100% losses as a result of my own market decisions. I did not consider 100% losses as a result of trading on the oldest BTC exchange in existence, and so my fatal flaw was a catastrophic underestimation of my counterparty risk, plain and simple. I made the best decisions I could make at the time, with the information and personal experience that I had to reference in making them. I accept the decisions that have been made. Again, there is certainly a lot of blame to go around, but I respect myself too much to wholly blame anybody else for what was ultimately my decision. I guess I feel worse for my dog than I do myself.

Life is just a game, cryptofriends. I lose.

My favorite thing about this song is that in my mind it can represent both despair and convicted hope. I think there's a lot of both in the community right now.

Cloudkicker - Dysphoria

But my apologies, again, my thoughts don't matter anymore. Down with the ship it is. It has been a true pleasure, and an honor to be a part of all of this.

"dqwqyii","All that and I still think his most damning history is when he was a commander in Vietnam. 

From his wiki:

&gt;Moore served in several posts as a military police officer, including Fort Benning, Georgia, and Illesheim, Germany before being deployed to the Republic of Vietnam. Serving as the commander of 188th Military Police Company of the 504th Military Police Battalion,[22] Moore was perceived to be reckless, but very strict. He insisted his troops salute him on the battlefield, against his training, as such recognition facilitates an officer being targeted by an enemy.[23] Some of his soldiers gave him the derogatory nickname ""Captain America"", due to his attitude toward discipline. This role earned him enemies, and in his autobiography he recalls sleeping on sandbags to avoid a grenade or bomb being tossed under his cot, as many of his men had threatened him with fragging.[21]

Apparently when he had this power in Vietnam as a commander he would send US units/patrols out to find “the enemy” all while the war was very close to ending and we were about to withdraw from the country . 

Imagine being a soldier under his command knowing the war was going to end soon but being forced out to engage the enemy and possibly get killed ...for what purpose? The withdrawal was pretty much official Moore was doing it of his own accord. Other commanders had already stopped or drastically reduced the risks they put their soldiers through.

"dquejnw","Yep. Trumps mishandling of Israeli intelligence was reckless and was most definitely a breech of proper opsec, and he should face some punishment for it. He's not going to, because, much like what Hillary did, it wasn't necessarily illegal, but, it could have compromised US and US ally operations regardless.

There are a few differences, though. First, whilst neither Sergey Lavrov nor Sergey Kislyak had the proper clearance for such knowledge and who, they (and by extension the Russian Government) are known entities who hopefully have better opsec knowledge than Trump. Contrast this to Platte River Networks, the people in charge of Hillary's email server, who are a private company, and are full of unknowns. Unlike the Russian Government, and, more specifically, the Russian Intelligence Agencies who would be in charge of the Israeli intelligence once Lavrov and Kislayk would report it; we don't know who the people at Platte River Networks are, and if they've ever had any security clearances/know what to do with classified info. And, this was a large period of insecurity containing unknown amounts of information, unlike Trumps reckless but singular leak.

Second potential difference is the fact that the intel Trump leaked  was (allegedly) a potential attack vector that Daesh was poised utilize.  Where as we don't know what the Clinton emails contained. Could be more critical, could be less.

As for the Comey investigation. Remember, when he started to draft his statement, Hillary was not yet interviewed yet. Largely, all that was known was that Hillary had a server that had classified information, it was maintained by an uncleared entity, and, following a subpoena, it's contents were wiped. However, some documents were turned over to the investigation prior to the subpoena. From this information, it is still hard to derive a conclusion one way or the other, as some evidence points to negligence and intentional obstruction, and some points to negligence and accidental deletion. I do not see how anyone could come up with a singular statement (and by extension, a conclusion) in such a situation without even interviewing the principle subject of the investigation.

Ultimately, what I believe is, given what we know as fact, both Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton failed to properly secure classified information. In my opinion, both are unfit for presidency (or at least both are far sub-optimal), and both should face some consequences for their actions. Not that they're ever going to.",1512550187,"and, this was a large period of insecurity containing unknown amounts of information, unlike trumps reckless but singular leak.","reckless but singular","reckless","but",FALSE,"reckless but singular","singular",NA,NA,1

"dqm3ijs","As I stated yesterday, this movement is horrifying, unsustainable, and reckless. 

But it's happening, so wheeeee!!!

The market broke out of the log channel the other day. That in and of itself is incredible. 

Arguably more incredible, however, is that the market made a strong and concerted effort to break back into it...and failed miserably. At least for now. 

There is no other way for me to interpret this movement other than incredibly bullish. 

If you missed the opportunity to open a long position in the $9000s, then you may get another chance in the near future if the market fails to make a new ATH and drops back below $10,000. 

Going forward, I'd make a rare recommendation to set limit orders about $100 above channel resistance-turned-support and move them up each day as that support line rises. 

Stops set 5% below the support line should cover you in case the market moves violently enough to break through and likely usher in a more significant correction. 

Barring that, opening a long at any price point significantly above the former channel resistance line is a potential recipe for disaster.

The market is going to swing, and it's going to swing violently. $1,000 drops in the span of 15 minutes are not only possible, they're to be expected.

If this does go parabolic, then that former resistance line is likely going to be the only thread of tradable TA that's going to be available to anyone looking for an entry.

Even a new channel that could theoretically form is likely going to break in one direction or another before it can even be confidently drawn. 

Keep in mind, the log channel that we've all been following could not be confidently drawn until the failure to break $5,000. Which means the market was respecting the channel for 8 months before you could even make a strong case that it existed. 

If somehow a new channel does form, that's rising even more rapidly than the previous channel, then it could be weeks or months before it's clearly identifiable and tradable. 

So, with all that said, I'm in disbelief and holding my long from $9570, which will be pried from my cold dead hands for the foreseeable future.",1512144913,"as i stated yesterday, this movement is horrifying, unsustainable, and reckless.","unsustainable, and reckless","reckless",NA,TRUE,"unsustainable , and reckless","unsustainable",NA,NA,0

As Roman had specifically instructed Neo not to reveal too many of her tricks, Cinder had no real idea how skilled a fighter Neo actually was, and thus instructed Mercury to work with her and get a feel for her talents.

Neo had to be careful in balancing herself. She didn't want the silver-haired brute to think her too weak, nor did she want to reveal her Semblance or even the full extent of her fighting skill to Cinder's subordinate. But Neo was being tested, and it behooved her to put up a strong front... she was starting to sympathize with Roman, who'd deliberately held back quite a bit to keep at least a few of his cards from his benefactor's view.

A little sparring session... Neo just needed to show she had talent enough to keep up. Nothing more than that.

Cinder and her green-haired subordinate were watching them. Three sets of eyes on her, and then she had to fight her instincts to not simply kill the man who'd handed Roman over to Atlas. So much working against her.

She steeled herself. If she just played along for a short while, this alliance of convenience would serve its purpose. She just had to keep enough in reserve until then. 

Mercury moved in. Neo measured the length of his stride, and listened closely to the weight of each impact of his foot, hitting the ground with a lot of force, thundering with his every step. He was heavier than he looked. Neo couldn't take hits from boots with so much heft.

So Neo pranced to her left, flanking Mercury and slashing at him repeatedly with the shikomizue in her umbrella. Mercury received the first two blows and disengaged, moving very rapidly. Neo briefly wondered if he'd taken the attack intentionally, given the speed he'd used to detach himself.

She couldn't doubt herself. She couldn't afford to be distracted. Neo pressed the attack, intentionally moving out of her usual combat style. Mercury continued to retreat, drawing her in, and Neo halted her advance and waited for him. She'd landed the first blow; it fell to him to return the favor.

Recognizing that she'd broken off pursuit, Mercury moved back into the fray and swung wide with his boot. Neo ducked under him, barely having to crouch, and stabbed with her blade, but Mercury twisted around on his arm, dodging her strike and moving to followup with a second kick. Neo barely dodged it as he fired off a projectile from his boot, shattering the ground where she'd stood a moment earlier.

He learned from his mistake. Just like Roman did when he sparred with her, reminding her not to rely on the talent she had, but improve upon it. Either Mercury was inviting her to try harder or he was holding back even more than Neo was.

Neo moved to attack his leg while it was pressed to the ground, but Mercury fired another shot to bounce himself away, moving back to both feet. Neo searched him for an opening -and there were many, it seemed like Mercury was unguarded on every side- and then decided to end things a bit sooner.

Just a tiny demonstration of talent. Just enough to let him know there was more fight to her.

Mercury dodged her attack and moved to punish her aggressive overreach, only for Neo to cartwheel backwards, using her hands for leverage and swinging her leg around to catch her heel against Mercury's chin. She refocused her attention and righted herself, bringing her blade towards his now exposed neck...

Mercury smirked at her as she rushed at him. He wasn't afraid of a blade rushing right at him. Even if his Aura absorbed the impact, Neo could followup with a second strike and kill him.

Instead he raised his leg and leveled it at her face, aiming another shot. It seemed he preferred mutual destruction to saving his life. He was reckless, but undeniably brave.

Neo kept charging. She wasn't going to blink.

""Enough."" 

Mercury hesitated, but lowered his leg. Neo was even slower to respond, the tip of her blade actually pressed to Mercury's throat before she managed to halt her momentum.

""It seems Roman taught you well enough,"" Cinder observed, stepping out onto their battlefield. ""Yes, you'll do. But we'll need to find a disguise for you; too many of the students at Beacon know your face. Mercury will take you into the campus and Emerald and I will find you concealment.""

Mercury smirked. Neo wasn't thrilled about being left alone with him, but had to admit she'd prefer his company to Cinder or the other one.

""Right this way, half-pint,"" Mercury invited.

Short jokes, too? Neo may have been wrong about hating him less.

___

Fortunately, Mercury put a stop to the wisecracks on the way to the dorm. He was all-business in bringing her onto the campus grounds and careful in concealing her from any prying eyes, even covering her with his taller frame. Neo hadn't invited his touch, but when blocking her from view, she had learned something interesting about those legs of his...

When they finally made it to the dorm, Mercury spoke again, showing off the accommodations and making one of the beds for her. Neo had no interest in sleeping in the same room as these three, but while Mercury was unfurling the sheets, Neo seized the opportunity to draw his attention, tapping him on the shoulder, then pointing down at his leg.

""What? Something you want to know?"" Mercury inquired.

Something she already knew and wanted confirmed. Something that spoke to her, in the silent tongue she knew well.

Neo pointed to her own leg and rolled up her slack ever so slightly, showing Mercury some of her ankle. She then pointed back to his leg. 

Mercury picked up on her meaning. ""You noticed, huh? Yeah. Boss was generous in giving me some upgrades.""

He was too simple to notice that his mistress had enslaved him, *branded* him by making him dependent upon her gifts. She may have granted him *some* autonomy but still held him on a leash. 

Not unlike Roman. And not unlike Roman, he was fearless in a fight, and measured outside of it. Just a bit younger... 

And wounded. Wounded not unlike Neo herself was.

Neo tapped against her neck. The scars were nearly invisible now, but he wasn't so dim as to miss her statement. Mercury nodded. ""In a fight?"" When she nodded, Mercury continued: ""Me too. Lost my legs fighting... an assassin.""

That wasn't the whole story, and it was strange he should hesitate. No, not strange... he didn't have reason to trust Neo yet. More... he didn't have a reason to boast about a victory over a deadly enemy. He didn't take pride in besting this opponent, whoever it had been. The wound left wasn't just a physical cost.

Neo sat on the bed he'd made and patted beside her, inviting Mercury to sit. He hesitated, but only briefly. Wary though he was of her, he wasn't scared to sit beside a girl on her bed.

She leaned in close... uncomfortably close, but Mercury didn't retract from her. She wanted to hear him, and she needed to get close to feel the pulse of his soul.

Each heartbeat told a story of loss and pain. Of a constant mistrust, of a loneliness gone unanswered, because he trusted none of the allies surrounding him now. Unlike Neo, the person who found him and helped him survive hadn't forged a bond of trust and affection: he was not partner, or ally, or friend... just a tool.

The green-haired girl was more clearly in Cinder's thrall. Mercury recognized he wasn't the favorite. If Neo was going to put faith in any of the three...

He was a brave fighter. And he'd suffered, just as Neo had, with no one to really offer him any support, just the promise of times and places where his talents would be put to use. Unlike Neo, those he fought beside wouldn't embrace Mercury when the battle is done. They wouldn't be around when he needed them.

Roman taught Neo three lessons: *never believe, never trust, never hope*. She swore by them, because there was no one in the world she trusted but Roman Torchwick.

She didn't trust Mercury now, but she thought she believed what his heart told her. And she hoped that by showing him something other than the harsh pragmatism of his mistress...

Neo pressed her head to his chest and wrapped her arms around him, hugging him tightly. Mercury just lay there, half-expecting her to attack as she nestled herself beside his heart, listening to the pace of his beats once more.

There was the faintest flutter there... of surprise at what she'd shown him. Of affection he'd long gone without and now, might... just might...

His arm slowly lifted. Neo felt his fingers brush against her sleeve...

Then he pulled back and lay still. He tried to deny it, to fall back on old instincts and -as Neo would- not trust this gesture. But his heart told a different story. 

And in time, so too would the rest of him.

"dpk6l3f","This fan base can alway use some positively

I have played every game, nor beaten a non 3DS game, but I’ll do my best to give my two cents:

Marth: I only got to the chapter titled “Fire Emblem,” but so far, he made me realize the theme of the series: starting off with almost nothing, then having an army. He’s the definitive Fire Emblem character, traveling the land, fighting an evil empire, and winning people on his side.

Alm: My current favorite. I love how he goes from a farm boy, to a war hero to a prince, with his village friends by his side.

Celica: I admire her devotion to Mila and the ideals of peace. I feel bad for how conflicted she was about Alm taking her throne through war, and how she felt the need to sacrifice herself to save the gods.

Lyn: I like how she’s Mark’s (and this the player’s) friend and guide to this world. I love her tutorial campaign. Discovering she’s royalty and setting out on a quest with two knights to meet and save her grandfather. The ending is super touching. I also love how disciplined she is as a Swordmaster.

Eliwood: Something about him feels classical knightly. Mainly how he always save Ninian

Hector: He’s the more jokey, aggressive Han Solo sort of character. I love how he’s a foil to the more disabled  Lyn  and the 100% good and nice Eliwood

Erika: she’s sweet and naive, but determined to do what must be done. (I haven’t gotten to Ephriam yet)

Chrom: He’s a great friend to Robin. He can be aggressive and reckless, but he does mature to become an Exalt after Emmeryn’s death. It’s sad to see him live in her shadow. He can afford to be dorky and silly, and it’s no wonder he’s a popular Husbando. I like how he gets married and becomes a father during the story, and the scene where he discoveries Lady Marth is Lucina is fantastic.

Robin: I love their design and relationships with Chrom and Morgan. I like the idea of a character that’s destined to be a villain the same way other characters are destined to be villains. They work well as the brains to Chrom’s brawn, and I love when they show their strategic side in the story. Although they’re a bit of an everyman, I like how their personality reflects a Fire Emblem player: someone who’s using their head to make sure nobody dies, and who loves everyone in the army. I appreciate the subtle differences in personality between genders. They were also the character I wanted in Smash 4, so seeing Robin animated in HD for the first time is a wonderful memory.

Corrin: I feel bad for how they are torn between two families they both love. I find it fascinating how they go from a fighter with a strong sense of justice in Birthright, a jaded individual who allowed terrible things to happen in the name of peace in Conquest, and someone who refuses to let go of their optimism no matter how tough things get in Revelation. They’re a sweet and naive person, and no matter what they chose, they love their entire family (except Garon in Birthright)

Rank: Battle-Brother

Specialty: Devastator Marine, Fire-support, Advancing of battle lines, Recovery of battle-brothers.

Equipment: Using ""Aquila"" Pattern Mk.7 armor Tyr utilizes most of the standard equipment used by his other marine brothers. A close combat knife and bolt pistol supplement his main armament, his much loved heavy-bolter. The ""Requiem"" pattern heavy-bolter that he uses also features a newly acquired Deathwatch addition, a heavy-flamer attached in much the same style as the ""Infernus"" pattern. Along with a few grenades chosen to suit the nature of the mission he has a hood that is attached to his armor, which sometimes needs to be cleaned due to the gore of the battlefield. Since his deployment to hunt down Orks he's picked up a few bits and small trophies from them. A choppa long tainted green with the blood of Orks and Gretchin now sits on his hip, something taken from the first Ork to strike a deep gouge into his armor; a long, straight cut that runs down his Dark Angels pauldron. Also along the way he managed to procure a laspistol for his serf, Viola, and lets her keep it on herself so long as they are out together on mission. The robe he had also first given to the girl has now gone through many different modifications with small bits and pieces of Guard gear now tacked on to form some ramshackle semblance of armor for Viola. The hood, now much tattered than once before, is also permanently singed a deep black in places from a grenade that had gone off near the marine and his serf, but ultimately did little damage to either.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Backstory: When he was younger, much younger than he is now, the young man adored running through the forests of his homeworld, Kimmeria. The young man would hunt along with others of his age and formed a pack much like marines of the 41st millennium formed squads. He'd order each one around, placing them in small formations to surround their prey before pinning it and exterminating it safely from range. While they were out hunting the young pack were snatched from the world, around the age of thirteen at the time, and taken by large, metal monsters of wonder. Each were massive hulking things with weapons that shredded anything that came too close to them, with one leaning down to them to inspect the soon-to-be marines. 

Each cowered under the steely red glow of the Dark Angel's gaze as it passed by, but the young Tyr stood strong despite the fear in his heart. The red glow stopped upon him in the small group they had been gathered, circled then by the other metal warriors. He was picked up then, violently, by the neck and heaved up by the green arm. He kicked at the space marine, pain flaring up in his very bones from the strikes, but he kept his own eyes trained on the red ones in the hood. A few more kicks and he was released from the grip, the rest of his brothers thrown from the circle to the woods. He tried to crawl to them, hands gathering dirt as his resistance kept up despite the green men's best efforts. What stopped him was a revving chainsword in front of his face while he crawled; the blade kicking up dirt that made him scuttle back and turn his scared eyes to the being that put it there. An unhooded helmet looked to him, some small sense of calm being put into him as it shook back in forth in a universal gesture. ""No.""

With the descent of the jet black flying monster began the next steps of his life, and the beginning of him becoming something more. Each day spent crawling through the mud felt like he was simply at home again. The nights where he studied and learn how to speak were spent with anger and volatility to the other recruits. One night the young marine throwing a near historic tantrum and putting four other recruits into a critical state. He was seen as violent and reckless, but this had its uses for the Dark Angel chapter of Space Marines. His recklessness? Drilled out of him from months being spent with a sergeant screaming at him for every error made in tactical judgement. Each simulation implanted new reasons for him to follow orders and follow the rules given to him. His ferocity? That was refined through training akin to that of his recklessness, being sent sprawling to the floor with each fight he trained in. The anger soon being funneled into a precise hatred and focus while he fought hard against those who would stand against him.

As he grew and the number of implants in him increased, so to did the feeling of brotherhood he had with his fellow neophytes. He'd grown to be a leader of sorts among them, but what would soon be sent their way would rock the core of his personal faith. The very first mission they were sent on as scouts ended in disaster, and Tyr could only save a small few of the friends he'd been deployed with. Bodies of the fallen the only sight he was greeted with as the Thunderhawk shook and departed from the terrible memory. He had lost, but there was still comfort to be found in the brothers that survived, and so he passed yet another test ahead of him.

Slowly, but surely, he made his way ahead and forged a path for himself and the brothers with him to becoming space marines. It was destined for him, or so he was oft to tell the sergeant assigned to his squad. The day he did become one he wasn't sure what to expect, it felt like it was right, but there was still so much ahead of him to do. He had to become better, he *had* to be a marine in every sense of the word, and he **would** one day have glory such that it would rival the mighty Lion's. That, however, was a long time away and for now he would have to deal with the world in front of him. One that concerned itself with aliens, exterminations, and the new brothers to be found in the Deathwatch.

Backstory Pt. 2: Electric Boogaloo

The Emperor had watched over him in the years he had been away from his brothers, but he had also been subjected to many different trials that rocked him to the core. He had been to many different planets on the outer rim of the sub sector in an effort to help cleanse them of the Ork menace, yet not much had changed there since he had deployed. The never-ending tide did as it always did and charged ever forward into his Heavy Bolter rounds, but they never seemed to learn. Tyr and Viola watched as countless were torn asunder from the inside as their entrails were scattered about the battlefield or incinerated in a righteous fire from his flamer, yet they never stopped. He had gained some perverse sense of respect for the Orks through all of this, but never once did he regret putting their kind down like the heretical filth that they were. During his lone campaign with his serf he had come upon a Mekboy and there he saw it tearing apart a squad of Imperial Guard with a power claw. He didn't remember quite what happened except a scream of rage coming from his mouth, Bolter rounds flying from his weapon with a righteous fury. Soon he was on his back, charged from the front by a near flying Mekboy as it stood above him, poised to tear the marine apart that now tried to bring his bolter to bear upon him. In an instant something jumped on it, though, a knife tearing through its eyes as another high pitched scream joined the symphony of violence and Tyr was able to knock the Mekboy over. He proceeded to shove his flamer into its mouth and melted the creature's face into a sick puddle of viscera while also staining his boots an even darker pitch black than before.

Falling down to sit he saw Viola crawl out from aside the Mekboy, tears streaming down her face as she leaped up and latched onto him. The Guard squad walked up from behind the dune they had retreated to and approached the marine, offering their thanks and prayers to The Emperor. One in particular offered a debt of gratitude to the man and handed the small girl on his lap a laspistol, telling to use it instead of a knife should her marine get himself into too much trouble again. Like that they were gone, returning to their base wherever it may be across the vast wastes of the backwater planet they were on, but what the Guard told Viola stuck with her and so she began the arduous task of begging Tyr to teach her how to shoot and fight. At first he declined, adamant on not letting her put herself at risk, but as she raised even more arguments throughout the nights about how her not knowing how to fight would put her at even more danger he eventually relented. Months were spent as the two continued their personal crusade against the Greenskins and slowly she learned how to fight like a marine, and how to shoot like a Guardsman. She wasn't a good shot and it would certainly take years more of practice to bring her to any sort of actual tactical efficiency, but it brought a sense of calm to the Deathwatch Marine, and that was enough for him.

Their mission wasn't necessarily a success, but nor was it a defeat, so with what they could do done they returned to the center of the subsector and arrived to something so horribly different than before. The flames of war raged ever higher and he could hardly believe that chaos that had been unleashed upon the different planets here. Things had changed and much in a way he hadn't been nearly as well informed upon as he would've liked to be, but he was here now and he would make the difference he needed to. The heretics needed to be purged and his Heavy Bolter had been running rather cold lately, it was time for the marine to change that.",1509826289,"he was seen as violent and reckless, but this had its uses for the dark angel chapter of space marines.","violent and reckless","reckless",NA,FALSE,"violent and reckless","violent",NA,NA,0

The Hobbit is one of the best adventure stories of all time, and 90% of the stuff that happens is inconsequential - essentially just a series of events and dangers they face from point A to point B. That's the style of storytelling that MiA has, and it does it well. Maybe that's not for everyone - I understand if you're the type of person who needs every scene to be relevant to the overarching plot instead of just fleshing out the journey for the sake of giving the story colour and atmosphere.

&gt; She does not get ""absolutely fucked"". That's part of my problem.

[What?](http://i.imgur.com/n3pHBEU.png) Riko gets the exact misfortune that we're told she would from ascending from that layer - bleeding and intense pain. Would it have been better if she'd turned into a Mitty despite that not being canonically possible? Due to the poison + the ascension she's put within an inch of losing her life. How is that not enough, unless you want the story to end there and then? The dangers of ascending (and the dangers of the abyss in general) are explored at length, and Riko is just as susceptible to it all as anyone, as you can see in the picture. But there are canonical rules to it all, and I'm not sure why but it seems that you would prefer it if the show had broken them.

&gt; Yet still falls for many traps and really only brings cooking to the table.

Reg wouldn't have gotten anywhere without Riko. As a team, they complement eachother really well. She's the initiator - reckless, but decisive, resilient, knowledgeable, and able to keep a cool head under pressure. Reg is the opposite - he has physical strength, but no mental strength. Constantly we see him freeze up in the face of danger - without Riko, or later, Nanachi, he, Riko, or both, probably would be dead. Also, due to his lost memories, he has no knowledge of the abyss at all. He doesn't know what to eat, he doesn't know what areas are safe to sleep, he doesn't even know basic survival techniques (while Riko is basically an S-Tier girl-scout). The way you're judging Riko's value, anyone would think you're talking about a battle shonen. There is more to strength and usefulness than just raw power.

"do0xh83","Thank you so much! :D
The idea is to play a character that leaves the safety of the family for the first time and doesn't know anything else beside the Giovannis traditions and ways (she was ghouled and knew about Vampires since teenage years) if we exclude a few interactions she had with some Tremere who had business with the Necromancers. So, in a sense, her biggest enemies are her pride and her ignorance. The reason why she leaves is because she felt like her position within the clan was becoming stale and she hadn't made any progress in recent years at all within the family. She despetately wants to be useful to the clan (even if she's too young and unimportant to be aware of what their ultimate goal really is) but keeps disappointing her sire and all her siblings think very little of her, saying that she didn't deserve to be embraced at all.

Her frustration is the reason why she suddenly leaves the Mausoleum without telling anyone even though she suspects that her Sire knows where she is at all times and somehow manipulated her into leaving as part of a complex scheme of his own. She ALWAYS has the family in her mind and her goal is to come back with a great discovery or a powerful ally to prove her worth to her sire. 

I like the idea that during the campaign she'll have to juggle between the coterie and her family. That may depend on how the ST will explore this idea, but I imagine some of her sire's goons popping out at some point and trying to persuade her to go back to Venice. They may even insinuate that if she keeps meddling with ""THEM"" (as you said) she may be considered a traitor and must be ready to face the consequences.

I could tell within its first minutes that there was a literary treasure behind the movie, and then I read the novel and was amazed. There was of course debate on whether Anderson's had reached Pynchon's greatness. Well, I suggested that the 2 works, book and movie, should be considered 2 different things. Apart from that, I thank Anderson because I am now a Pynchon reader. The show industry picks up authors and adapt them. Sometimes it goes well and sometimes it is a disaster.

I like this production. As a matter of fact I was rewatching it right now. I must declare in awe with Tomlinson's work. Her way to play Demelza is outstandingly skilful. It is the character that interests me most. She's sound. When she says to Ross that she has lost her pride in him, that's a great line, explaining an uncommon feeling. Demelza's character is so firm and coherent that it's helped in some personal affairs of mine. 

I understand that episode well. It's been rushed, yes, because of the nature of the show. But I don't think any viewer would doubt Delmeza's love for Ross. Hugh is a treat to herself, I understand. I don't think she gives herself to him for revenge. She wants it for herself, and I think she's entitled to it. She knows Ross' ways well: he's tough and reckless. But so is she. When Ross comes from France, she stands up very well for her rights to dispose of the warehouse as the mistress of her state, being him absent, probably dead. She faces him perfectly. She does it with a perfect logic. And with that same logic she treats herself with some poetry, with some romance. From the gutter to Nampara; having lost a child in the most terrible way, out of her goodness; having endured Ross' rudeness at all times, and yet keeping her sense of morals... she's entitled to it.

"dlzxs1a","&gt; Now I've read a summary, and apparently he just NUKED the place, without even warning them to retreat. 

Worse, he intentionally doctored the campaign to draw in as many Alliance commanders and military forces as he could, to destroy them all in one fell swoop.

&gt; Afterwards, he stated that instead of expelling the Allies, his now plans where to commit even more genocides. 

As far as I know, it was Jaina who nearly destroyed Orgrimmar with the help of the Focusing Iris and the retaliation of the Alliance navy that forced the Horde navy to pull back that humiliated Garrosh, leading him in his rage to proclaim that the conquering of Kalimdor wasn't all he wanted. He wanted Alliance-race extermination.

So yeah, pretty messed up.

&gt; I always remembered Garrosh as the ONLY one in the franchise with character development. I thought that Baine and Voljin never aided or supported him, and in fact they disdained him. 

I don't think this is too fair. As far as I know, Vol'jin had particular spats with him and you can see this in the Troll starting zone, but the trolls were being banished from Orgrimmar. Strained ties between the two is kind of expected when you exile their people from the Capital of the Horde.

As for Baine? He was obedient, and even saved Garrosh's life against Quilboar at one point. If I'm right, he even reaffirmed his loyalty to the Horde after saving a humiliated Garrosh. I believe he was loyal, and while he may have been able to be more forthcoming with advice, etc., Garrosh too could have been  forthcoming in asking for advice. That was indeed what he was advised to do by Thrall when given the mantle of Warchief.

&gt; But as it turns out, instead of character development, we got an instant character transformation. He simply went mad after Cata.

To me, his character development was going in two different directions.

I would have loved the character had he been the honourable but brutal orc that he appeared to be in Cataclysm. War with the Alliance? Fine. Great, even. What a great way to breathe some volatility into the game and the lore. Throwing Krom'gar from a cliff, stating ""Honour, Krom'gar. No matter how dire the battle, never forsake it""? What a God damn boss.

Or, mana bombing a city in a strategic display to painfully haemorrhage Alliance forces? Savage. Utilising the Divine Bell to turn his warriors into hulking monstrosities? Reckless, but unquestionably dangerous. 

But doing all of these things? Ah, I don't like it. The thing I hate most is how he was clearly very strategically minded but either too dumb or too proud to use diplomacy when it could have counted most -- even if only for his allied Horde races. Indeed, he was responsible (not solely responsible, but largely responsible) for the Mak'gora that occurred between himself and Cairne. His inability or unwillingness to be sympathetic and focusing on how he would have proudly claimed responsibility had he done it was a complete walk-off-a-pier statement. I could see why Cairne would challenge him to Mak'gora. Who would want a leader so callous and uncaring for his own people?

___

As a final note, however. He didn't really go ""insane"". He's still very cognizant, but contrary to /u/Beardnash's own essay (which I agree with for the most part), I think his sense of honour became severely clouded with the bombing of Theramore, for instance.

He has always been brutal, and has always been centred on strength. But considering how he speaks in Cataclysm to Krom'gar and how he behaved in the bombing of Theramore, I think it's fair to say that his sense of honour (or maybe even whether he valued it or not) changed.

A darn shame either way, imo. He would have done superbly as either character, not some distorted amalgamation of both. It is perhaps the only thing I question in Warcraft storytelling. As in, I believe they really could have done better.

___

**TL;DR:** Garrosh didn't ""technically"" go insane, but he made a lot of bad choices (and some of them good, or at least very understandable). That would have been fine if those choices went one direction or the other and not both. Either make him a brutal, honourable Warchief or make him a monstrous tyrant -- the storytelling tried to do both, and that's where Garrosh's character development failed. In all, he consistently valued strength, though it's questionable whether he always valued honour.",1503454145,"reckless, but unquestionably dangerous.","reckless, but unquestionably","reckless","but",TRUE,"reckless , but unquestionably dangerous","dangerous",NA,"unquestionably",1

"dlfqsoo","I like your comment, so please forgive me for over thinking it a tad; well I understand what you mean, I think you have it reversed - Ron is 99% Hufflepuff but has the heart of a Gryffindor. Ron is a Huffler in a lot of ways, largely, but not just in how he handles friendships. Because he mostly is a good friend, and certainly one who is happy to have your back...

But he would be disqualified because he his more characterized by his *abandoning* friendships than an unwavering loyalty. I think this is a reckless but brave behavior, both the pro and cons of a Gryffy, to be able to grow even if it's away from familiar people but also sometimes getting caught up in drama or over reacting and severing ties.

But it's also these same dynamics that allow him to be brave enough to admit wrong, and reconcile differences. I think Hermione and Harry, well rarely starting or over reacting to turbulence the way Ron does, would also have the hardest time dropping a grudge and admitting they were wrong/want to be friends again.

In GoF and DH we see Ron and Harry split up, and maybe Ron is mostly to blame, but it's Ron who puts the effort into rekindling the friendship. In GoF, even though Harry misses Ron, it's Ron who went looking for Harry and interrupted his chat with Sirius. It's Ron who can't help but want to be there for his friend after watching him fight a dragon, and offer an apology.

In DH Ron runs away when they are horcrux hunting. But pretty much from the second he leaves, he is working to get back - well Harry merely had to say Ron's name. That kinda vindictive behavior, justified or not, is very much a Slytherin thing to do. Even when Ron was furious and felt slighted do you think he'd ever make some personal pledge to never speak someone's name?

The thing with Dorne and the Iron Islands as well is that they aren't just one new storyline - each one is two new storylines (Quentyn + Arianne, Victarion + Euron/Damphair).

Let's look at Victarion - what does adding him to the show achieve, really?

Whereas in the books, Asha Greyjoy flees the Kingsmoot only to do very little. I don't think there's a lot wrong with having Asha and Theon be the ones to take a Greyjoy fleet to beat Euron to Dany, and so undo the need for Victarion in the show.

"dkgus99","&gt;Again, he uses this to justify his actions, while what he does is out of self-preservation.

Illidan during the War of the Ancient novel is power hungry, headstrong, and reckless. But he works to drive the Legion out of Azeroth. And when he realizes the true strength of the Legion, he creates another well **so the Azerothians has the chance to fight the inevitable Legion attack.** His personal flaws aside, his intentions were still nobel.

As the time went, Illidan was painted more of a crazy maniac. But Illidan's actions and intentions wasn't to harm Azeroth. Before the Legion expansion and the Illidan novel, it was left up to the fan's interpretation on his motivations.

The reason why people love Illidan was because he was a complicated character. His motivations, methods and reasoning were all complicated. It wasn't as simple as him just being self-serving. Even [this](https://youtu.be/M79j14JK_xE) video, made 3 years ago ends with the note that Illidan can be understood differently by different fans. Maybe they intended Illidan to be bad. But he was still an ambiguous character with different interpretations. 

What they retconned isn't his actions or choices. They added new information that explained the somewhat ambiguois intentions. I love that they didn't change his history of the lore but instead, solidified his character through addition, not editation or deletion.

As for general play, I would goldfish your deck a bunch for the next few nights. Just play solitaire with your deck. When it comes to playing against an opponent sitting across the table from you, you want to know exactly what your lines of play are and be able to make them quickly. Don't play quick and reckless, but make sure you can make quick and accurate decisions like ""what should I grab with gifts"" so your opponent doesn't have to sit there while you peruse your deck for 2-3 minutes. Also, make sure you're very clear and deliberate with your actions and you communicate with your opponent. If they've got untapped mana, announce what you're playing, look at them, and make sure they either give you the okay or tell you to wait because they have a response. Most if not all random opponents at a large event aren't evil and won't try and trick you (if they are, though, get a judge and get them out of there), so you should make sure you do the same by being very clear with your actions.

I’ll get into some more detail: so I started drinking at 15 and from the very start I would binge drink every weekend too. I went out a lot, friday and saturday, and was always the last one to go home, the last one holding a drink. It was never a healthy relationship, it was my escape route, I poured all of my frustrations into it, life couldn't be ALL bad as long as I had that and my friends, right. I never wanted to go home or get sober once I started because then the fun would be over, then I would feel bad again, I’d be hungover, I’d go back to being the sad, unmotivated, nihilistic person I was/am. Then I found weed and it was very much the same, except I could do it a lot more, I could do it all day everyday if I wanted to… and for a long time that’s what I did, that’s all I really wanted to do (besides getting really fucked up on the weekends, of course). It was all about hedonism and escapism. I meddled with a lot of different drugs too and put myself in a lot of stupid situations. Something I realized not long ago is that I always underestimated how easy it was for me to lose control over myself and my life. As I said, I was/am REALLY impulsive and reckless. But underlying all of that was a lot of guilt, which in turn would make me want to escape even more. Part of me wanted to escape and self-destruct and part of me wanted to be someone to be proud of and they were always in conflict. 

When I was a little girl my father developed schizophrenia and had to leave my life, so I was/am very of afraid of going “insane” too, eventually weed would make me paranoid that I could lose my mind at any time and make my anxiety much worse and I would overthink about everything wrong with myself and in my life... that's when I finally took it down a notch. Not drinking though. I'm not good at balancing things out, when Im into something Im REALLY into something and that goes for everything. Im having to distance myself from most of my friends too because they all still drink and smoke all the time and I dont think I should be near that stuff now, its extremely easy for me to change my mind about drinking at any given time so yea, Im keeping my distance for now.

"din4zlv","Yes it does. Where is this misinformation coming from?

Almost every crime requires intent. It depends what the intent is, but nearly every crime has intent as an element. Most crimes by committing the act that led to the crime makes intent inherently clear and obvious.

It's not intent in the sense of, he HAD to intend to obstruct justice, but rather he had to intend to act in a way that the elements of obstruction of justice are met.

Think of it like this. Theft requires intent. Trust me on it. Generally when you steal, the act of taking the item satisfies the intent. So say you see an old lady walking down the street and she is feeble and barely hanging out to the danged thing. You run past her and grab her purse. You intended to grab that purse so therefore you've met the intent element of a theft. It doesn't matter whether or not you knew it was going to be theft.

However, imagine that you didn't intend to grab the purse did you still commit a theft? Bear with me because we are going absurd. Say you are walking down the street. The little old feeble lady is still barely hanging onto that purse. Now let's say you are carrying an inordinate amount of objects that you can barely see what you are doing. Let's say one of those objects are a fishing pole that hangs out a little further than it should be. Now let's say you walk down the street past the old lady and that fishing pole snagged the purse and the purse is now hanging off the fishing pole. You have no idea it occurred. You are carrying so much shit you didnt feel the extra weight from the purse. You continue walking with the purse now on your fishing pole. You didn't intend to cause any of your actions to take that purse. You were just walking along. You simply intended to continue moving in the same direction you were.

Did you just commit the crime of theft?

I'd hope not. You made no intent that your stupid actions would deprive the feeble old lady of her purse.

I get what both of you are saying and its like both of you are right.

I am a reddit noob so idk how to highlight a name but whatever. Seracjuze, I see your point. I play as a shinobi every now and then so I do understand the character to a degree(by no means am I a expert). You are right that IF you get close to a shinobi it CAN mean instant death. BUT there are options for the shinobi to put distance between their opponents and that is I think Hotchikss50 is getting at. After a light(miss or not) you can back flip to gain distance, if you're hit, then you cannot chase the backflip as you are stunned from being hit. There is the silent double dash tech(idk I randomly came across this one on reddit) which pretty much dashes you backwards without the smoke effect. The multi dash tech as well that can be used to dash sideways and then a simple back up creates space. So it is not as easy as you make it sound, which is probably why Hotchkiss50 is annoyed.



Hotchkiss50, I get what you're saying that a good shinobi knows how to not only use their kick in a prime moment but their whole kit to minimize the potential punishment. The options are abundant and I feel that frustrates everyone. I will also say that Seracjuze is right on the fact that if you close in on a shinobi, you can possibly wipe the floor with them like they are a new swifter. Easier said than done, quite understandable, but it is possible. I have done it, people have done it to me whenever I play as a shinobi. I just think we need more time to figure how to counter them. It is overwhelming at first, they come out the gate seeming OP as fuck. Once we find a way(even after the kick nerf) around the kick, many many people will quit playing as the shinobi as they suck without landing that move. I do get that this character is meant to stop turtles. If you sit there, the kicks will fly and break your defensive play. I think this is to stop the meta of just sitting there and relying on parries to punish. I think that isn't how the game should HAVE to be played at higher levels, and I feel that this character can break that. If you know that kick is coming or any of the other options they have, you probably know that you shouldn't sit there and you should probably take action and be aggressive. Not reckless, but more aggressive. Just my thoughts.


This is how I see the game and new characters:

New character = OP

New Character is then nerfed to being slightly better than others

Old Character are then buffed to bring them in line with the new Characters

&gt;That's  what the victors' historical record says [that Hitler viewed Jews as subhuman], but definitely not what he himself said or those around him.

Once again, Comrades Viktor V. Viktorov and V. Viktorovich Viktorov slander another great man when they write history! That Adolf Hitler, world renowned vegetarian and kindly old gentleman would think of Jews as subhuman is nothing but Viktors' justice! And not just Hitler: that Hitler's closest advisers could have thought so poorly of the Jews is naught but vile calumny!

&gt;He didn't consider anybody inhuman (I am sure you can find quotes but those are figures of speech most of the time).

See the unassailability of this man's logic! When Hitler said the Jews were subhuman, or called for their annihilation or extermination or destruction, he was speaking in *metaphor*! Much like Jesus, with whom he had much in common, Hitler spoke in parables, like in his famous parable, simply titled: ""The Bad Samaritan, But That's Repetitive Because Samaritans Are a Type of Jew and All Jews are Bad and Must be Annihilated.""

&gt;There must have been something broken along the chain of command for jews to die because in the beginning of the war, he wanted the out of germany to what we now know as Israel, couple years later, he wanted them deported to madagascar.

To sum up the Holocaust in one phrase, if I may: A tragic miscommunication. See, we've established that Hitler liked to turn a phrase, and a great lover of figurative language. Unfortunately, his underlings sullied the reputation of National Socialism when they took literally phrases like:

&gt;Today I will once more be a prophet: If the international Jewish financiers in and outside Europe should succeed in plunging the nations once more into a world war, then the result will not be the Bolshevization of the earth, and thus the victory of Jewry, but the annihilation of the Jewish race in Europe!

See, when Hitler said ""annihilation of the Jewish race in Europe"", he meant ""annihilation of the Jewish race in Europe by helping them get a nice new pad in Palestine."" [What we've got here is a failure to communicate] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6cake3bwnY)! It's like a game of Telephone where Hitler starts off with ""Please find a Final Solution to the Jewish Question"" (meaning of course whether they should be sent to Madagascar on navy ships or if the work should be contracted out to the private sector), then it was passed to Bormann who said:

&gt;On instructions from the Fuhrer I make known the following: Where the Jewish Question is brought up in public, there may be no discussion of a future overall solution (Gesamtlosung). It may, however, be mentioned that the Jews are taken in groups for appropriate labor purposes.

and unfortunately when it got to Himmler what he heard was ""Make sure to get all that valuable hair and golden teeth when you kill all the Jews.""

Moving right along:

&gt;He didn't want bloodshed pretty badly. In fact he made what were seen as mistakes to try to avoid killing.

See, Hitler believed that all life was a struggle. We all have a great struggle, Unser Kampf, which we must not shirk. Of course, Hitler didn't mean a literal struggle, all life is precious! This is once more a figure of speech, what Hitler meant is that we all have a spiritual struggle against our inner devils to fight, so that the world may never again know the great loss of life that goes with war! And Hitler knew a thing or two about devils, as he writes about in *Mein Kampf*:

&gt;Since the Jew is not the attacked but the attacker, not only anyone who attacks passes as his enemy, but also anyone who resists him. But the means with which he seeks to break such reckless but upright souls is not honest warfare, but lies and slander. Here he stops at nothing, and in his vileness he becomes so gigantic that no one need be surprised if among our people the personification of the devil as the symbol of all evil assumes the living shape of the Jew.

So what the victors out there might call ""strategic mistakes"" or ""complete incompetence"" were actually Hitler's mercy and conscience preventing him from taking the ruthless path that the merciless Allies took only too readily:

&gt;His airforce alone could have destroyed britain but he didn't want British people to die while at the same time, british planes were throwing bombs in the dead of night in every house with a light. He let people get killed to avoid killing himself.

Unlike the countless Allied war crimes committed during the bombing of Germany, Hitler's limited bombardment campaign in Britain was a restrained defensive measure. British blackouts during the Blitz were not to hide themselves from bombers, because German bombers were never do such a thing, but because the British are a people of darkness, and they liked to spend time in the dark plotting new dark deeds to commit against innocent German whirlwind reapers. After all, the Luftwaffe was so unstoppable they could have destroyed all of Britain had Hitler but let them!

&gt;I cannot reasonably write out everything there is to it, but he was certainly quite the character. He was not who he is portrayed as, there is more to him.

Yes, some people think of Hitler as a megalomaniacal genocidal warmongering drug-addicted dictator but he was so much more than that. Painter, vegetarian, animal lover. Just look at that [face] (https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/141/590x/secondary/Hitler-stupid-smiling-276417.jpg). The face of a thinker, a warrior, a man for all seasons. Yes, Adolf Hitler was all that and more. But he was not perfect! Perhaps his greatest flaw was that he was too selfless. He cared too much for his fellow man, with nary a thought for himself. A man of limitless accomplishments and unbridled modesty. I can safely say, that to know him, was to love him. And to love him, was to know him. Those who knew him, loved him, while those who did not know him, loved him from afar.

In conclusion:

&gt;I am not a neo-nazi

The best analogy i can think of is cars. Theyre dangerous in the hands of irresponsible and reckless. But, you dont really think that to yourself when you hop in your car and drive to your destination. You dont hold any emotion to the car because it is engrained in your culture. You see safe drivers every day. For each accident you see, youve seen hundreds of non accident cars on the road. You dont think twice about the danger because you yourself use a car and are surrounded by reasonably safe drivers.

Not just reckless, but criminally dangerous because it could have killed someone even though no one got hurt.  There is then a spectrum of offences based on whether anyone *did* get hurt.

Drunk driving is also a federal crime, with similar interpretation and consequences.  It's pretty much dimensionally and Golden Rule equivalent to dangerous driving in the first place, and the majority of federal legislation simply revolves around the blood sampling methods and your rights and obligations.

(Incidentally, although street racing is provincially regulated, actually killing someone in a street race is a federal crime equivalent to murder.  Life imprisonment.)

Almost everything else is provincially regulated and a regulatory offence.

"dhclkvt","This is probably an unpopular opinion, but I think RWBY's creators didn't feel entirely comfortable with a show whose main leads were four girls and, taking into account an audience made mostly by men, they made Jaune. Compared to Yang, Weiss and Blake, he has a much stronger ""protagonist"" feeling to himself: the way his arcs were written, his personality, his mysterious potential, his teased relevance to the plot... He often looks like the second protagonist of the show and embodies a popular shounen archetype that's different from Ruby's. 

While Ruby is the talented main character, the one who's already really good but still needs to improve herself, the one who's reckless but optimistic and usually gets herself in trouble, Jaune is the one who starts as weak (but has some hidden potential who justifies him being in a place where he doesn't belong) and suffers from his own inadequacy. 

Having said that, I think ""RWBY"" and its audience, even if we are not aware of it, need Jaune.

But, I'm also convinced that he wouldn't be so divisive if he were a girl. Even considering that with female-Jaune the entire series would play differently (no Pyrrha-Weiss-Neptune love square, no locker-room scene, no big damn kiss for Pyrrha, etc.), I think people would appreciate the wide variety of female characters, from introverted to upbeat, from competent to weak, and so on. Obviously, there would be a vocal minority complaining about female-Jaune being so incompetent (at least in the beginning) and being harrassed by Cardin, but it would be less vocal and more minority than the one who currently complains about Jaune's over-abundant focus and screentime.

The FNDM has a tendency to be more tolerant towards those characters who are cute, hot or cool.

I agree he's a bit unprofessional and definitely reckless, but he's not a bad guy. Plus, remember the Initiative is a civilian endeavor. There are rules and protocol but ultimately it's a ship full of civilians without formal training or discipline. 

Not even Liam has military training or discipline, and if I remember correctly, there is a hint he was even fired from his job as a cop because he wasn't very good at it. I think that makes him a very relateable character because he's not the usual hero. He is a flawed person with good intentions.

In a very strict society, there's no doubt Liam would lose his ""job"" and be punished for what he did, but honestly I think people like him are important. Well-meaning people who put their hearts ahead of everything else, who you can count on to do the right thing no matter what. Strict, military rule where everyone is expected to be nothing but perfect is not always the best way to do things.

But mentally healthy children don't suddenly decide to take their life because they are being bullied. I believe most, if not all suicide victims had major emotional problems (very possibly as a result of the bullying) that were not being addressed.

It's easy to target bullying, or dismiss it as kids being overemotional and reckless. But I believe the most important underlying issue is mental health, something which is ignored and shameful in Western (most places, actually) society. If we put more emphasis on keeping our minds healthy, as well as encouraging healthy lifestyle habits instead of filling people up with pill cocktails or telling them to just get over it, or worse yet - ignoring it completely and allowing people to be consumed by their mental illness, we would probably be seeing a lot less of this.

"dfw3pzb","Miles was shoehorned into scenes that already happened, and that was a big turn off for me. On top of the fact that Nick Fury just gives him the suit and the A-OK. What appealed me about Ultimate Peter was how isolated he felt. Sure he had MJ, but not always, there was a gap between him and May and when he did come across other heroes, they'd have mixed reception to him. 

Suddenly Miles shows up and everyone loves him. He has a best friend who does all the science stuff for him, he has a loving family who are all there for him, he has support from pretty much every hero imaginable and he has no identifiable personality traits. 

When we first meet Peter, he's angry and reckless, but smart and well meaning. When we first meet Miles, even he believes that he doesn't deserve everything he's getting. Whenever something bad happens to Peters personal life, he decides to focus on being Spider-Man and sacrifices his own happiness. When something bad happens to Miles personal life he either quits or has someone help him.

I like Miles but he is not a fan favorite. Every time I look at him, I miss Peter. I can't think of him as a great character because he spends the whole time complaining that people don't judge him on his own merit while running around calling himself someone else.

"dfvu9c4","Get used to two things right off the bat to improve your Learning process, rather than just neutral overall. The ways to learn what your neutral should be is to get used to attacking set strings, habits, and setups in training that you'll fall back on when you're in a bind to give u more time to think about your next move without wasting mental energy on your current scenario. U should never be thinking about your conversions, combos, blockstrings, etc. That should be for the lab and become muscle memory. 

Second, go for one new risky move and do it, whether u win or lose, until u know where it's actually safe to use it. For example, I would use to play random characters against people and constantly try to grab them when I think I could. Eventually I found a general sense of when and where ppl would tech and when grabbing would get me punished. This will help u build GOOD habits and allow u to know when or when u shouldn't go for certain things. Think outside the box for new approaches. Like, have u ever seen the general doom player sj S foot dive and dash up forward instead of down? How come Spencer's don't sj down grapple and Zip away more often?

"dfgeee3","Anytime you find that someone has shifted their campaign subtly to rely more and more on a term or phrase rather than the original arguments, you should take a step back and trace things back to their origins.

""Total shutdown"", ""collusion"", ""treason"", and even ""Russia"" itself are currently being used rhetorical tools. They neatly sidestep the nuances of the situation and invite people to settle on a simplistic, *absolute* answer. There's no degrees of guilt, of awareness, or even of participation. There's no longer a difference between an unsupported friendship and an all-out conspiracy. There's no difference between Trump's allies breaking the rules and Trump himself breaking them. There's no difference between talking to a Russian and working with them against the US.

What generally makes this work is a widespread preexisting interest or concern for a topic. If you care about an issue, **be wary of who you allow to speak on its behalf**.

---

To draw a comparison, I would point to three specific rallying cries that Trump and his administration have seized from supporters and turned to their own purposes, slowly replacing their original audience with one favorable to themselves.

1. By 2016, everyone was upset with the media. Standards were slipping, manipulation was getting uncomfortable, and nobody was really putting it in its place. Politicians themselves were, as a result of their own excesses, unable to put their foot down to stop it. People across the world were finding it more and more difficult to defend their beliefs as the level and reputation of reality and fiction were blended together.

 Trump took this anger, distrust, and frustration and very rapidly diminished it into a single phrase: **fake news**. It should be obvious to anyone who has listened to his attacks that the only thing he brings to the table is his exceedingly crude and blunt criticism. He isn't elucidating hidden truths or laying out the machinations of a broken system. He's shouting. He's shouting so much that his own words have taken on the same quality as that which he decries.

2. The second adopted cause I'd point to is his concept of **rigged elections**. Again, everyone is upset with the vulnerabilities in the system. That's already a thing. Trump isn't a prophet here, he's a scavenger.

 Bernie's campaign was the first to express discomfort with the state of elections in the Democratic party. They were, at first, thorough and open about their feelings. As time wore on, they became enflamed and reckless but the sentiment, the instigation, and the neglect by figures of authority *was there*.

 Then Trump started describing his own primaries as ""rigged"". After he won those, he openly joked that it didn't matter because he won.

 Later, Trump again began calling the election rigged. Rather than pointing to evidence or instigation, he referred to imaginary votes which weren't even cast yet.

 After winning, Hillary's supporters joined in as the third voice to express concern about election vulnerabilities. Unlike Trump, her campaign chose to express those concerns *by making official requests to investigate the results to determine conclusions*. Hillary herself stayed out of this, allowing Jill Stein to speak for the movements. Trump responded by mocking them as sore losers.

 Later--again--Trump began to call the election rigged one last time. Now he imagined millions of fraudulent votes and refused to provide evidence.

 By now you've probably noticed a difference between the spokespeople of this concern. One particular voice has been inconsistent, inconsiderate, and incompetent in their approach. That voice, unfortunately, *controls* the term ""**rigged**"" right now.

3. A final borrowed sentiment was **draining the swamp**. Trump himself openly claimed to have used the phrase for the simple reason that people liked it. He did not care. He didn't like it for its own merits, he liked it for the support it could earn him.

 The entire country hates politics right now. We hate corruption, neglect, manipulation, and deceit. Trump claimed ownership of these concerns in a fashion that embodied their worst fears.

All of these phrases are now untouchable, even by the people who are concerned about them. I can't criticize the news without expressly distancing myself from Trump. I can't criticize the elections without explaining that he doesn't speak for me. I can't complain about misbehavior and bad eggs in government without declaring myself a separate party.

Likewise, I can't really talk about Russia, inappropriate interactions, or how to react to these without laying out the differences in my reasoning from that of the campaigning left.",1490587338,"as time wore on, they became enflamed and reckless but the sentiment, the instigation, and the neglect by figures of authority *was there*.","enflamed and reckless","reckless",NA,FALSE,"enflamed and reckless","enflamed",NA,NA,0

"df54fnq","&gt; yup completely agreed because if she was serious shirou would had been dead at Einzbern castle while trying to save illya.although the thing is she has no reason to be soft to shirou unlike fate route since they did not interact with each other that much to begin with.why would she care about shirou who is protecting illya the same girl who cut saber in half and whose father was the reason for saber being unable to obtain the grail in the 4th grail war.not only that shirou is now trying to stop saber alter from obtaining the holy grail just like kiritsugu did at the 4th war that alone should be enough of a reason for saber alter to kill and destroy shirou but she did not.so saber would not spare shirou there if she was in character and only did because the plot demanded it just like how fate zero plot demanded saber's np to be sealed.

In the 1st place Alter already knew what the Grail truly was due to the corruption and she changed because of that, she accepted that her wis was a foolish one and was only helping Sakura because she felt simphaty for her, she didnt kill Shirou in the forst after the battle with Berserker because she didnt really care about anything that was happening she only obeyed Sakura´s orders and she did not make an effort to complete them, thats why in the forest when she was about to kill Shirou she retreated because Sakura called her and Sakura called her because she absorbed Berserker´s soul and needed protection and once again all of this is explained in the VN and it doesnt has anything to do with Zero.

&gt;no she perfectly knew shirou had 3 projection and all his limit and warns shirou he would self destruct if he overuses archer's arm which shirou also knew.she also knew shirou would not retreat even with that risk.that is why saber was shocked and caught off guard when shirou projected his blades 4th time that is perform projection 4th time because she was absolutely sure shirou had 3 projection limit and she was right.

No, she said that because Shirou´s body was breaking apart because of Archer´s arm corruption nothing more. She was surprised because despite his body being almost done he still surpassed his own limits.

&gt;having a froozen arm would barely effect someone like berserker at all and berserker already broke through that.also fate shirou was actually able to block his attack which by hf shirou's own admission can not even do once so he does not even bother trying to block it and goes for the dodge even though it will kill him rather

Of course it will affect him since he cant move his arm freely and only in a direct line which is far more easy to predict while he can not even put strenght on his grip making his attacks way weaker, he didnt free himself of that you should go read that part again in the VN

&gt;also fate shirou is significantly superior to hf shirou because of his strong connection to saber via the dreams he had which means whenever he projects caliburn he also inherits her skills,technique and attribute without suffering through 3 projection limit and mental degradation consequence which hf shirou has to in exchange of getting some of archers skills,technique and attributes.also fate shirou can project avalon,hf shirou can not proving that fate shirou is superior at projection than hf shirou.

Fate Shirou is only superior while having his connection with Saber and Nasu said that after Saber dissapeared his image of Avalon dissapeared as well not to mention that HF Shirou was using,basically, his own technique which fits him a lot better than Saber´s technique as we could see in the UBW route in their training. HF Shirou only weakness was that the arm was killing him other than that he was strong as shit due to the arm giving him a somewhat servant level and all the knowledge and techniques of his future self. And of course HF Shirou is worst in the projection magic because he is using Archer´s arm/circuits to do it instead of his own.

&gt;she has always been careless and reckless like charging sasaki's Tsubame Gaeshi nearly getting killed and surviving only because of her instinct,charging recklessly against kazuki and again survived because of her instinct and charging recklessly against hf shirou Crane of the wing but unlike before because of her lower agi and instinct she could not survive that.

Of course, you said it she was reckless but she still survived because of her skills which were not taken away to seal something out from her, Excalibur and by extention her arm in Zero´s case. 

Sealing Excalibur nerfed because she could not use her right arm at full strenght causing her to be way weaker than she should had been.

Its not the details but for what purpose they did it, in Zero it was to make the LN longer unlike FSN and it is not even retarded because if you think about it, Saber would have killed Gilles if her arm was not sealed and then she would have fought Lancer and obviously defeated him as well (since it is a prequel)  which would had made 2 servants retire the War too early, thus they sealed Excalibur and by extension her arm making Saber weaker so she could not defeat other servants

Do you live in the city, or the country? City.

If you had to define parkour, what would you say? The art of motion and how an individual chooses to move through an obstacle course presented to them.

What do you know about it? Not entirely sure what you mean here but if you mean its origins then I'm pretty sure it was started by David Belle and his group in France in the mid 80s.

Do you know anyone who practices or has ever practiced parkour? I practice and train with plenty of different people that practice parkour when I train at my local gym.

Have you ever encountered an athlete practicing parkour? If so, explain the experience. Never encountered someone I didnt know training outside but I meet people all the time at my local, 99% of the people are really nice and will gladly help you out if you're new to the community.

Have you ever wanted to practice parkour? Have been 3.5 years now.

If you wanted to train parkour, would you know where to go? Yep, and I train there weekly.

Do you agree with people practicing parkour in the streets? All the way, it leaves footprints and stuff on the walls but as long as no one is intentionally destroying property or causing any trouble then I'm all for it.

Would you prefer people train parkour in the streets, or in designated parks? It depends, where I live there are no parks so its either train in a gym or train on the street, many people, including myself, do both. If a park was available I would by all means train there but I would still train in the street because part of parkour, in my opinion, is being able to apply it to your ""real life."" That and, a park can only keep you occupied for so long, it's similar to a skate park, every skater skates at the park but there are plenty of stairs or ledges that don't exist in the park but that do on the street and the skaters also want to skate those so they do both, same goes for parkour.

Do you think parkour is dangerous or reckless? What makes you think this? It depends, if you decide to do a roof gap after training for only a , month then yes, parkour is dangerous and reckless, but if you want to do that same roof gap after three or so years of training in general and about a month or so of training progressions and looking at how you can bail then parkour is not so much dangerous or reckless. In short, parkour is always gonna be dangerous and reckless but so are plenty of other things, the longer you train, the more prepared for the danger you are.

Given the answer to the above question, why do you think people train parkour? Everyone has their own reasons, Personally I started training because I think its a useful life skill that everyone should have but a quickly became very passionate and started training flips and the more ""reckless"" side of the sport, I also trained because it was something that wasn't the norm, not that many people can just do a back flip. it was also something that I am using to become physically stronger, as its a very demanding sport. Lastly, I keep training because it makes me happy, it allows me to take my mind off whatever other stuff and just focus on parkour. Now granted, some days I go home mad because I hurt myself or because I just had a bad sesh and couldn't land anything but that's rarely the case.

How would you define happiness? What ever makes you feel at ease and something that you feel good doing.

What one thing makes you happy, and how does it do this? There is no ""one thing"" that makes me happy, there are many but each one can also make me sad at times depending on how things unfold. I have no idea why I'm happy doing what makes me happy but I am.

Hope this helps! And just a recommendation but if you haven't posted this around on some other subreddits then you probably should because all the answers you get here are going to be biased as mine was. maybe post it on r/gymsastics , r/running , r/weightlifting , r/skateboarding or any other similar reddits.

"df3w00e","Yeah, the sacrifice AB ending didn't really sit too well with me either - as you say, it just didn't feel like something Max could let herself do. There have been some good arguments made for it - one I like is the realisation that Max has really messed up a lot of things with her time travel powers, so why would yet another use of her powers make anything better? But even then, I think Max would have felt it worth the risk. 

&gt; Max is back at the beginning of the week, just that Chloe actually died, right? So she still has to save Kate, right?

So, if Chloe dies the timeline changes pretty substantially - Nathan is arrested immediately, and in turn he gives up Jefferson. This means Kate no longer attempts suicide - I think that's for a multitude of reasons - David won't have bullied her on Monday as he'd have been busy with Prescott, Jefferson was getting arrested on Tuesday so he never said whatever it was he said to her to make her so upset, and perhaps Victoria would have been so distracted by her best friend being arrested she wouldn't have been bullying Kate anymore. IIRC as the photos change for that timeline, Kate's suicide becomes the police discovering Rachel's body at the junkyard. I'm guessing this then means the dark room is discovered and she is quickly identified as a victim, and starts getting the professional help she needs. Long story short - she was still depressed, but the specific events that made her hit rock bottom that week never took place.

&gt; Why did she leave the galery in SF? Just because of Chloe's call saying that there was a tornado? At that time (at the galery with the principal), she had no reason to believe that she would actually be able to prevent the tornado, right? So why did she decide that she had to leave that timeline at all?

It was just to save Chloe. I don't think she was thinking of anything else at that point. Remember she had literally just rescued her from death, yet again. She just wanted to be in Arcadia Bay instead of San Francisco, so she could rescue her. It was pretty rash and reckless, but I would say that Max probably wasn't in the best frame of mind at that point. 

&gt; she leaves the galery through focusing on her photo that hangs on the wall? And then she simply does not show her photo to Jefferson, so she won't be in SF when the tornado hits? But why does this end up in her being in Jefferson's bunker again? 

She tears up her photo as soon as it's taken. This presumably resets the timeline back to what it was before - i.e. leading to Max being kidnapped and Chloe being shot by Jefferson. However, this time the torn photo remains in her journal - originally she tore it up and left it in the toilets just before saving Chloe the first time, and Nathan ended up picking it up. When Jefferson finds Max's torn photo in her journal he gets angry and burns the whole thing - which means that Max couldn't use any of the photos she originally jumped through to get back to Jefferson's class on Monday, so she is stuck in the dark room.

&gt; Why is there only the choice between letting William die and paralyzing Chloe? Can she not try to save William and then try to prevent Chloe's accident aswell? Sure, she would need a photo. But IIRC there's a photo of the moment where the alternate Chloe opens her present and pulls out the key for the car she got from her parents. 

This is a good one...I guess there's lots of potential answers here. Max would need a photo of herself to leap back into, however - even the butterfly photo that she uses right at the end has her reflection in it. So, any photos just of Chloe wouldn't work (and those montage photos aren't actual photos, AFAIK - they're just the game's device for showing time changing). That being said, Max has lots of photos of herself. That's kind of her thing. So I guess in theory she could've just leapt back into one of those, taken at the right time, gave Chloe a call, apologised for not being in touch for so long, wished her a happy birthday, and tried to convince her not to take the car out that specific day. It might even have worked. 

But it would have also been a very different game. Time keeps moving, even through all these photo jumps, so assuming the storm still came on Friday morning regardless, all these photo jumps would have probably taken up the rest of the time in game, replacing the search for Rachel (and if Max had succeeded, presumably there wouldn't even ever had been a search for Rachel), and you would have still ultimately have had to have made the same choice.

I had actually expected the game to include some kind of puzzle involving Max's photo jump abilities and her 'memorial wall', where she had to keep trying to jump through photos and change different things to get a certain outcome. I thought it was interesting that even when Max leaps back to her own dorm room to tear up her contest photo, the 'boundaries' of the photo are just small enough that you can't interact at all with the photo wall.

[When Sinbad mentions accepting the Fog Troupe and impoverished as refugees in the manga, Ja’far points out that doing so would strain Sindria’s financial situation, which Sinbad brushes aside.

"dewgrbh","I didn't want to be here. I was forced here against my will. We ruled this land for a hundred millennial; the dark wings in the sky, princes of the air, lords of man and beast. We co-existed with the red men for all of that time in relative peace and harmony. Sure, we'd destroy a village or two every once in awhile to keep them in line. But for the most part, they worshiped us as gods and brought offerings and living sacrifices. This pleased us. It pleased us very much.

These white men are a different breed all together. They arrived suddenly and unexpectedly in giant floating cities. They caught us unaware and pushed us westward from our ancestral homes in the coastal mountains, just as they did to the red men. They burned down the forests, slaughtered the beasts of the wild, desecrated the land with tools of steel and iron.  They attacked us with mighty cannons, tore our wings with searing chunks of metal; they stabbed our elderly and clubbed our young to death. Those that stayed to fight died. Those few who made out live here now, on the great western frontier.

Here isn't home, but it's not so bad either. The land is wide and mostly empty, still teaming with delicious shaggy beasts of hoof. The air is clean and clear, the rivers bountiful, and the mountains much larger than those back east. Small dragon clans of Green, Red, and Gold have sprung up and begun breeding younglings. The hunting is good, and even when it isn't the red men here tremble before us and bring gifts and offerings a plenty. For a large and ancient black dragon like myself, it's practically a paradise.

Yet even here the pale skinned men have begun encroaching. They slaughter the shaggy beasts and red men alike, and for reasons I cannot understand they even make war upon one another. They pepper us with stings from their short weapons and long weapons. I've learned the long ones hurt more, but the short ones fire faster. Luckily they come here in much smaller numbers, and are much easier to deal with than the armies back east.

I've burnt entire towns to the ground. I've devoured their women and crushed their children between my claws. I do this not for pleasure (pleasurable though it is) but out of necessity. If the white men come here in force, they will push us further west - right into the ocean. I cannot let that happen. I will not let that happen.

Now they come in larger numbers, leading vast herds of hoofed beasts. They are smaller than the wild shaggy ones, and have far less fur, but they are much tastier and easy to catch. The only problem: they are guarded by white men in wide hats mounted on tall powerful beasts. These men are wild and reckless, but their aim is true and they show no fear when my shadow passes over. I've seen groups as small as 10 take down dragons; not as old or powerful as I, but not younglings either.

I have no choice, I must drive them away: for the sake of all dragonkind. My wings are strong, my teeth are sharp, and my flames are hot. I will drive them from this land, or die trying.\

We were young, and wild, and reckless, but youth was beautiful, and wildness was powerful, and recklessness...recklessness was stupid, but we didn't know it yet.

We made our own music with cheap guitars and untrained throats, we made our own drinks with stolen bottles from our parent's cabinets. We made our own fun with each other's bodies and stupid jokes.

The fire burned, and so did we, bright and strong, and in the orange mix of fire and sun we were nothing if not beacons of life and love and light.

------

It was a night of freedom, a night of truth. The sun was long gone and the fire was nothing but embers, but the stars burned so that our night wouldn't end. The music was gone and the bottles were empty. Two by two they disappeared into nearby trees, looking for a dark place where they could be as loud and as quiet as they wanted. Some of us stayed by the embers, and she huddled against me for warmth.

------

It was a cold, brutal dawn. The sky was clear and the world was silent. The fire was dead and our time was done. We scattered like leaves with promises of future fires, of future songs, of future love.

Today they announced they want to stop a medication in 5 days I have been on daily for 13 yrs that I obviously need. My Dr., who just met me and isn't in that field and doesn't know why exactly I take it. Pointed out the extreme dangers of that.

A fast reduction is also incredibly dangerous and reckless but I didn't bother.

Gave family her name and location in case they want to file a wrongful death or malpractice suit. Pretty scary.

"ddbviuy","Aside from rule 1, Chrom is perfect.

Edit for clarity

&gt; The Lord can't be stupid.

Chrom in part one was reckless but pragmatic. He often took to a very direct approach but he had good ideas like teaming up with Ferox to fight Plegia. It's when the Robin cocksucking in conjuction with Emmeryn's awfulness as a leader kicked into effect that he became the meme he is today, unfortunately. He's a victim of Awakening's writing, but victim or not he does violate this rule.

&gt; The Lord can't be boring.

""Chrom is bland"" is my favorite meme. Chrom, while not as exciting as the one liner action Heroes that are Ephraim and RD Ike, he is plenty interesting. He goes through a full range of emotions over the course of the game. Not to mention he's a doting father, a teasing yet protective older brother, leader of a personal militia, prince of a nation, the straight man, a competitive best friend, a ridiculously awkward husband (dork Chrom is best Chrom), and an overall charismatic individual. Chrom has more layers to him than most lords, as far as I'm concerned.

&gt; The Lord must be perfect.

This is a hard one, since many of the ""accomplishments"" in the plot are accredited to Robin. So technically he gets a pass on this one?

&gt; The lord can't be too dynamic.

See all those things I mentioned about Chrom? They all happen in subtle yet very notable ways. Chrom manages to be a doting father and a dork husband at the same time yet neither of those things seem out of place for his character because his core never really changes. He had a brooding episode but that was justified since the person who raised him.... did the thing. At no point does he ever really feel like a different character. This is perhaps part in due to the fact that Awakening itself is such a dynamic game tonally that Chrom being so many things is par of the course. It's sorta like how Gintoki, the protagonist of Gintama, could be a gambling drunk lazy asshole but also be a super badass inspiring samurai when the plot calls for it.

&gt; The Lord can't be a shitty unit.

[Chrom is a top 5 lord](https://www.reddit.com/r/fireemblem/comments/3drke8/debate_best_unit_by_class_lord/ct8525g/).

&gt; The Lord can't be non-existant.

He's in every scene and is somewhat a driving force for the plot. 2/3rds of the villains are his, and the last 1/3 is half his.

&gt; The Lord can't steal the spotlight.

The runners, Roofie and Shaker, meet their J in a quaint bar called the *Fellow's Respite*. He tells them he needs a very secure facility broken into and it needs to be done over a few international borders. The runners are willing to hear him out despite the risk. Blackhawk tells the runners they need to infiltrate the Saeder Krupp's Global Seed Vault in Svalbard, Norway. Specifically, he needs them to escort a psychometrist named Ragnar into one of the vaults to inspect the seeds. 

The pair fly to Oslo through a long change of uncomfortable flights. Roofie gets a little lucky on the flight and seduces Veronica the Stewardess into grabbing a drink with him sometime in Seattle. They then meet up with a local guide, muscle and Ragnar's babysitter: Devour. 

The group make their way to Longyearben, a small town a few kilometers outside of the Vault's location. Shaker does a little investigation and decides against renting a vehicle to drive to the vault site. The team gears up in against the cold and Roofie uses a spirit to have them run to the vault.

Once they reach the Vault, they find it surrounded by a mana barrier. After a little work, they manage to pry the exterior doors open. Roofie is forced to dispel one of his sustained spells, though. Inside, they find another set of doors. Devour begins to work on opening them, when the team is interrupted by a deafening roar. Outside, three armored polar bears have amassed. 

The bears rush into the chamber and assail the runners mercilessly. The bears are strong and reckless but seem eerily coordinated. After exchanging a blows and bullets, the team watches some of the wounds of the bears close, even when they should have died. Desperate, Shaker aims for their skulls and paints the walls with their brains. Enraged, Devour follows up with a solid punch right into the skull of another. Defeating their enemies, the team goes deeper into the vault. 

Halfway through, Roofie's chemsniffer ring warns him of Neuro-Stun seeming into the chamber. The team nearly succumbs to the noxious gas but rushes to safety. After the gas dissipates, they break through the last few layers of the vault, into the inner chambers. Roofie has a spirit materialize into the room and use the emergency escape to gives the runners access to the seeds. Devour collapses from exhaustion and the team decides to let him sleep it off a bit, he was more than a little belligerent. The team becomes nervous by the distant roars of more polar bears approaching.

The team allows Ragnar to examine the seeds, stim-patches Devour awake and prepare to leave. However, they are stopped by a presence outside. A voice declares that they need to surrender. Shaker, Devour and Roofie collectively decide to flip it the bird and rocket out the vault at lightning speed. 

Devour hurtles into the body of an manifesting mage. He narrowly dodges the paw of a polar bear beast spirit and coup de grace onto the mage, tearing his astral form asunder. The spirits vanish and the team absconds back to Seattle. They deliver Ragnar to Blackhawk and the team is commended for a job well done.

"dcehe8m","Hi, 

I was actually planning on taking the TOEFL first, mostly because I'm more familiar with it, and it's actually one of the exam options that the University I want to apply to accepts, but unfortunately in order to get a student visa to go to the UK, you need to have taken the IELTS, that's what made me change my mind.

&gt;  What is your favorite film, or film series and what are the major themes or messages in that film that connected with you? Are they tied to a specific period of time in your life, and if so are they still relevant to you today and why?

My favorite film series is definitely the Harry Potter saga, the first movie came out when I was twelve years old, so I could really relate to the characters, it felt as if I knew them, as if I could actually be close friends with them, had they been real.

One of the things that made me like the movies and also the Harry Potter books was the fact that the characters grew up at the same time and pace as I was growing up, so I could see my real life conflicts reflected on them, some examples of those conflicts are: not fitting in, teenage love, heartbreak, and also realizing what makes myself unique, and accepting all that my uniqueness encompasses.

Some of the teachings of the movie, are still relevant to me today. They say that it's a good practice to watch the same movies and read the same books but in different periods of one's life in order to see if one projects themselves on a different character. I can definitely say that now that I'm older, I think that some of the kid's choices were rather bad and reckless, but at the time I first saw the movies, I thought they were very brave.

If I had to choose a character I related to when I was a kid, it would've been Hermione. She always thought problems could be solved by studying and having knowledge handy. Right now I relate more to the older members of the order; nowadays I have two nieces, and their wellbeing is my top priority, so I now understand why they would sometimes try to keep the kids out of harm's way.

Thanks for reading.

Like with that example with Ruby, Weiss wasn't wrong when she pointed that Ruby is acting childish and reckless, but then she admits that she herself was too harsh to her.

However, it would be interesting to know more about why she decided to close her eyes to Blake's past, because that probably would be quite a hard thing to do for her. But in general, I would say that these events characterize Weiss in a good light, despite probably not being written that well.

As for Whitley, I take their conflict as something long-lasting, from way back. At least by Weiss's words he never liked her and Winter.

"dc5mlrt","Alright, let's talk about Ran, I'm not used to give a whole analysis but I will try my best to show my opinion on his role in the series.


We get to know the perfect team of AA after he captures Dan, we know too that they are there for other reasons than friendship or just climbing the tower together, they are there because AA wanted a perfect team and would have them no matter what, then we get to know the powerlevels and that Ran is the strongest, he is actually one of the strongest regulars in their rank, so we can expect him to be extremely powerful.


After getting to know the people in the team we see them in action, Ran gets mad with Dan because he used emile, so we know that he is a team player when on tests at least, after that he win a 2v1 proving again that he is really strong.


Next event is Hand of Arlen, they go there hunt Cassano because AA wants to test their strenght, Ran starts being extremely annoying and just go full reckless, it isn't a test so he is not taking it seriously and trying to do everything on his own. Ran probably was the strongest for a long time while climbing the tower, he thinks that he can overpower everything, but when they go inside the building and finds Cassano he has to play like a team with Novick so they don't losse.


Ran can be reckless but he is not actually dumb, he just thinks that he is always the strongest, for someone that is used to be the strongest for so long finding people that are strong than him is something new, and there he finds Cassano and after beating him Viole 1v2's them, they are forced to go up with Viole after that even if they don't want to so they can survive, right there we can see that Viole is extremely powerful and that Cassano is too, Ran will never be the strongest again after that.


While going up with Viole's new team Ran says that even if he doesn't like it, they are the strongest team he was in, so now we get to know a whole new level of power in term of teams and individuals in the tower. We know now that AA's perfect team was not even close to Viole's team, Ran that is extremely powerful is weak compared to Cassano and Viole, so Ran showed us perfectly how the power levels are right now.


After getting to know how powerful Viole's team is, we get to know AA's new team, and we get a perfect contrast, they can't do anything right and AA is annoying just like Ran right there, he knows that his team is bad but is still working really hard with them.


Ran's main purpose is over now, he showed to us the new levels of power and now is a member of Viole's team, also an annoying regular, and from now on he only grows, he didn't run away from Viole's team and keep being an useful teammate, we knew from before that he is a good teammate on tests and he keeps like that, ties twice with Anak and after the workshop battle he gets a bit less annoying.


So Ran shows us again in the workshop that he is strong but there are plenty of strong people. Right before deciding that they are going to the hell train he calls beta for his team to catch Cassano. Why would Ran do that? He decided to help Viole and his team, and keep going up the tower with them, right now they are finally in a team where they want to be, they are free to do whatever they want to but they decided to be helping the team, and in Ran's new team he is the strongest again.


They go to the Train City and there we get to know yet again the new power levels there, Ran beat a lot of regulars but he gets beaten by Moontari that shows us how strong the ticketeers are.
After that Ran keeps being a good teammate until the Name Hunt Station.


In the Name Hunt station we get to see his team again, they are still after Cassano and they need to get in the train for that, so they go for the station and Ran wins his first good fight in the series against someone that he was expected to be beaten, after that he only gets beaten by Arie Inieta and injures himself, being incapable of getting in the train.


So Ran is the character that was used to be the strongest, and he gets to know that he is actually not the strongest anymore and keeps getting beaten, his annoying personality is a huge flaw and SIU shows us how being annoying and reckless will get you in a bad situation a lot, but he works perfectly for the narrative because everytime we see him fighting we understand more about the oponents, Ran showed us how powerful enemies/allies are multiple times, we got to know how hard it was going to be for Wangnan team to win the workshop because of Ran, we already knew that Moontari was strong when Viole fought him for the first time because Ran had been beaten before, we got to know how strong Viole, Cassano, Anaak and a lot of people are because of Ran. He is actually really annoying but his flaws are never ignored, when he acts reckless he almost instantly pays for that, and I think that SIU did a great job using him so we can understand the power levels better.

That still didn't stop an asshole who is having a bad time to yell at him just because his perception is that he is speeding just because the car is loud. Giving someone a bit of their own medicine a la making it louder by making the car kick down into 1st gets the point across pretty well.
not the guy running around with a hole in his muffler
He was trying to find out where it was coming from in relation to his RPM. Its called diagnosing a problem. he found it. It was a hole in his muffler. some irresponsible dumb cunt decides get upset because he is still driving the speed limit, and uses her kids as an excuse for him to slow down because they are playing in the street. Are you fucking kidding me? I was getting yelled at by my parents for playing in the street. a neighborhood street is a passage for CARS to travel through NOT for kids to just play in the street. Newsflash... when people oftentimes get hit by a car because they are in the street, the person driving is almost never charged. because in most cases its actually illegal to do anything in the street other than drive a motor vehicle or bicycle as you are considered impeding the flow of traffic. Yes, even that teenager whose basketball just jumps into the street and the kid decides to run after it without looking for cars first, the driver is not at fault most of the time.

Uhhh.... it was 10:30 at night, hardly 12:30am (that's what zero dark thirty mean in military jargon). It was cold as fuck outside so the guy wanted to warm up the truck before he leaves. Diesels dont run very well when cold. They take a long time to warm up. And take almost as long to warm up the glow-plugs in order for the engine to start in cold climates (you could literally wait for 5 minutes before being able to crank it over and expect it to start). So some dumb cunt gets upset that someone warming up their vehicle that is mildly loud, in the dead cold night, decides to walk the 500feet or so i this cold as fuck weather just to climb into someone vehicle (another cunt move and definitely cause for me to drag that shitbag out my vehicle if someone did that to my vehicle) just because her dogs started barking which may or may not have woken her kids? That's one kind of mental gymnastics you have to try and justify the kind of person you are. What if the dogs were barking, not because they heard the truck... but because they heard PEOPLE outside saying their goodbyes at a party? At 500 feet? A fucking diesel is almost NEVER going to be THAT loud and have its sound travel THAT far when its idling. I would know... i have one. It has a 5"" exhaust. Its loud. but you'll never hear it idling from that far away.
It seems a lot these stores tend to be from some ""dumb cunt"" that decides to yell at the driver for doing something so innocuous. hardly any stories of men doing the yelling... unless their elderly and hating life (like yourself). Most men dont bother because they understand. Not to say that any man is going to let some sort of vehicular mischief continue on, like some kid speeding through a neighborhood or making donuts in an intersection.

Some dumb cunt thinks he's racing around and decides to yell at him for something that is not causing any harm to anyone. No, you dont have to downshift to come to a stop.

Again, how could trump have done that without being in office? As soon as Trumps in, he's appointing people with no diplomatic experience and huge ties to Russia into positions of power.  
If it turns out he's doing that for personal benefit to the detriment of the country, that's treason in my book. 

You can argue there's no definitive proof yet (and you'd be right as far as I know) but there was nothing criminal in what Hilary did apparently.

I appreciate you stating that. I am not trying to be mean. Once again, I mean no harm.

You may have viewed my extremely fast actions as being reckless, but I was definitely not being inconsiderate. I did not intend to harm the community.

&gt; But see it from our perspective, in a matter of 4-5 minutes we saw over 1.1k posts approved/removed

This is true. 1.1k posts and comments.

&gt; from a mod who asked us twice for full permissions,

That is correct. Though by asking twice, it was sent in separate PMs, since reddit does not allow you to edit PMs. theoretically it is just once.

&gt; it was in an very unprofessional and harass-like manner. In the modern era, harassing does not necessarily mean violence. Only verbal disrespect. 

How was I being verbally disrespectful?

""I need full permissions to configure CSS and link flairs.""

You responded that that is not my job, and that I should focus on post/comment moderation.

I responded: ""Fine with me.""

How is that being verbally disrespectful? You didn't give me full permissions, and I was fine with that.

&gt; We had reviewed a few posts, and most WERE NORMAL POSTS!.

Yes, but they were from a while ago. They appeared in my modqueue with few to no comments.

&gt; You spammed normal posts. And approved spam. 

I need proof that I reported normal posts for spam. I am sure I did not do that.

&gt; We very much encourage using mod toolbox, but not for mass approving and spamming posts. 

Mass approval? Even though this was a 4 minute window, are you saying I cannot just sit at my desk and spend a solid 3 hours checking over each post in the whole subreddit?

&gt; I am fully aware on how you used that tool, it was in a reckless manner.

If you believe that I have reviewed posts too quickly to be verified, then I apologize for that.

&gt; I will be glad to provide evidence supporting that normal posts were removed. 

I did remove some normal posts, from [deleted] accounts, from a while ago.

&gt; I would also like to clarify, when I said 165 posts deleted, there were 165 deleted posts and comments. 

Almost all of it was rule breaking posts. Some are spam, some are rude.

&gt; You also approved over 800 posts, which I believe you could not manually review in the 5 minute window you executed these actions in. 

I did. I used a combination of RES and toolbox to expand each post and read over what the user wrote, and then approved or removed based on whether or not it broke the rules.

&gt; Once you approve those posts, without filtering through them, we don't know which ones have been reviewed or not. 

Like I said in my original post above: Approval means reviewed.


&gt; It makes spam and bad content filtering nearly impossible without any organizational method. 

I open my modqueue and look at each post and if it works out, approve. If it doesn't, remove. What is the issue with that?


&gt; I do admit our reaction was impulsive, however you have caused a lot of chaos. 

I appreciate that. I want to know if the community believes I have affected them.

&gt; Whether unintentional or not, we respect posts. Regardless who makes them, and we want to preserve this community. 



&gt; Here is some spam he approved. 

That post is a user selling something. If you click on the link now, it's expired. I would have definitely removed that.

Before this edit, not quite sure why you posted a [gif of homer](http://giphy.com/gifs/homer-simpson-fat-mumu-Sm8Ec3ddRWXa8).


&gt; Here is a normal post he removed, it has an author, yet you removed it without discretion! 

There were no comments and no votes. I believe that after a year passes, it is save to remove such things.

&gt; These are people who care about the community, we take the time to filter through posts. 

I am trying to be efficient as possible while trying to maintain quality.

&gt; Us mods clearly know that you mass removes posts just to get a higher percentage on the Reddit toolbox mod activity chart. 

""Us mods?"" Have all the mods reached the same consensus as you?

Higher percentage? I swear on my life that **was not what I intended to do. I did not even know that the toolbox had a chart.** I am new to the toolbox.

&gt; What business do you have removing year old posts.

After reviewing newer ones, eventually I got to year old posts.

&gt; I should also admit, I meant you had written your application and requests in a very bad manner. 

Other people wrote about the same amount of text.

&gt; But that is MY FAULT. NOT YOURS, MY JOB WAS TO SCREEN MODS. I could have done a more professional way. Player72. I apologize for the confusion from this chaos, however, our removal of you as a mod is completely warranted for unauthorized MASS-APPROVING and MASS-SPAMMING without discretion.



So I cannot use the moderator toolbox? The toolbox allows you to go through each post, quickly expand it and read it, then click the checkbox next to it if it breaks the rules. Once you have checked each post, you can click remove selected to remove the rule breaking posts.

&gt; Doesn't matter. You can be reckless and negligent without being drunk. Running after crashing into someone is an excellent example.

No, it's not, for the reason I explained in my other response.  It's not evidence that he had a mental state of the defendant was reckless when he struck the victim.  It's an after the fact fact that was a _reaction_ to the pedestrian's death.  It wasn't a fact that _led_ to the death.  

One can indeed be reckless without being drunk.  Speeding can be reckless. Running a stop sign can be reckless.  Weaving between lanes can be reckless.  But leaving _after the fact_ is not reckless.

"dak1uhe","&gt; Since the button is not working, there are no possible consequences of this decision. Perhaps you mean possible in the sense that there is a logically possible world in which the button is operational, but then we must also say that there is a logically possible world in which biting the apple would kill people. In any event, it seems from your last few sentences that you are concerned primarily with the world we are actually in.

I would basically agree with the last sentence. Despite some of the more fantastic examples, I'm concerned with a world in which we *just know* that sleeping and waking are different, even though we sometimes have dreams that are totally realistic. After all, these dreams end and we wake up to tell people about the vivid dream we just had. In this regard, I'm rejecting a generalized scepticism that would make the jump from saying sometimes we don't know whether we're dreaming to we never know whether we are. (I should mention that my thought it deeply indebted to Stanley Cavell's *The Claim of Reason* in this regard).

It is for this reason I'm not comfortable with your example of virtual reality. That scenario is predicated on erasing the very distinction between illusion and reality that nobody actually labors under--except for philosophers drumming up examples. [EDIT: perhaps one day virtual reality will cast this very distinction in doubt. In that case, ethics is up for a big re-evaluation.] The end point of this line of thought is Wittgenstein's notion that a lot of what passes for philosophy is just ""language on holiday"": creating problems that nobody has solely for the purpose of trying to resolve them. Doing philosophy in this way has a couple of undesirable consequences: not only does it become more and more remote from lived experience and thus threaten to become irrelevant, but by the same token it abdicates the task of helping people make sense of their lives.

I write that lengthy tangent just to give a sense of where I'm coming from, and maybe it helps to see why I insist that ethics is just misplaced when applied to dreams. It's not that we are ethically responsible for or ethically unbound from our dreams--we aren't ethically *anything* to them.

&gt;I have to wonder, the case of the apple biter... if the inception of this person's insanity is at the point in time at which he first believes that biting the apple will kill people, and he is perfectly sane in all respects other than the fact that he believes biting the apple will kill people, does this truly count as insane enough to merit the absolution from his accountability here?

To me, this line of thought is verging on absurdity. Let's grant what you suggest--that this person is unremarkably sane in all ways, except that he suddenly believes biting an apple will kill 10,000,000 people. You're suggesting he ought not to be absolved of ethical responsibility because of his intention. I would certainly grant that his intention is monstrous. But can you really imagine condemning him in the same terms as you'd condemn a terrorist? Nobody would take you seriously, and you'd probably tarnish your reputation as a maker of ethical judgements from then on. On the other hand, you could just condemn him quietly in your own head, but then ethical accountability seems trivial.

This is the point I was on about earlier in talking about being responsible *to* somebody. The concept of responsibility in general doesn't make sense to me--I simply cannot imagine ethical considerations outside the framework of society. That was my point about driving drunk in a post-apocalyptic world being stupid and reckless, but not unethical.

"dai4b2z","1: My guess is the horn was stored in Illian for a long time until it was stolen and taken to the Blight during the Trolloc War. Hawkwing explains that the shadow being able to blow the horn was a lie, so they woulda just hidden it away in the Trolloc Wars.

Yes it was a waste for all the Hunters, but how where they supposed to know?

The horn is gold emblazoned and real fancy looking with the inscription ""Death is no barr to my call"" so anyone who found it would probably be able to guess really.

No one really knows WHAT the horn is. My guess it's some artifact even older than the age of Legends. Possibly created with the power that Rand now has since he can do shit without channeling.

Yes Jain was a new hero added. I do believe he states this.

2: No much is known about the Sharans, but i'd guess the army got shattered since the Sharans have a ""Mixed bag of emotions"" about channelers, unlike the Seanchan. Some are slaves, others are not. It seems like Wilders are kept as slaves, and anyone from their version of a White Tower are kept almost as nobility. They refer to all the Channelers they find who are not Sharans with some specific word that i took to mean Wilder. and they kept male channelers as pets unlike the Seanchan. 

Jain got in there because he's just that god damned good.

3: It is only Aiel Channelers, Borderlander Channlers would ask for an honourable death iirc, and the Aiel would not allow the pretense, while Aiel channelers were ""Sent to the Blight to spit in Sigthblinders eye"" and were subsequently captures and either turned, or joined the shadow. 

My guess the Aiel who could not channel are the byproducts of Aiel Channeler breeding programs to try and create as many Aiel Dreadlords as possible

4: Lan had no hope of really accomplishing anything MAJOR, but anything minor he could do to be a thorn in the side of the Shadow was worth it. Even if it meant his death. ""A lone king who courts death in the blight as other courts pretty maidens"" Deep down he knew it was idiotic and reckless, but he did it out of anger for the loss of his kingdom.

It is never explicitly said, but it would be foolish to assume otherwise.

- [Day 6](/s ""Caster then offers to ally with them and give each of them a stronger partner. Hell no, don't trust someone who was about to kill you! Shirou and Archer both refuse, but Archer decides to just let her go and call their fight a draw. Shirou is pissed at him for this! Me too, we could have gotten rid of this nuisance right her :("")
- [Day 6](/s ""Archer's logic is that he wants Caster to continue to suck up magical energy so she can defeat Berserker for them, and afterwards they can beat Caster. He doesn't care about how many lives are lost, and would actually prefer less people in the way so he could fight more. That goes against Shirou's principal to not involve innocents though, so he's livid. But Archer plainly says that you can't save everyone, and the damage would be even greater if a Master other than Rin or Shirou win the Holy Grail. Sacrifice for the greater good eh?"")
- [Day 6](/s ""Shirou is pissed and won't accept Archer's words. He intends to follow Caster and defeat her now. At this Archer attacks him...mother fucker! Shirou takes the slash to his shoulder, then retreats to the mountain gate and falls down the steps to avoid Archers next attack. Saber is there still fighting Assassin, but he lets us go at the promise from Saber to resume their battle in the future. Then Assassin faces the incoming Archer and blocks him from attacking Shirou, and they commence battle while Saber and Shirou retreat"")
- [Day 6](/s ""Interesting conversation with Saber back home - although Archer attacked Shirou, he is not angry about it because they had made no promises from the beginning. Saber thinks that Archer is not cruel for what he did either, and believes the his character is reflected in his sword technique - a clear stream with no evil in mind. She thinks Shirou could be as good as Archer if he trained for a long time. This makes him resolve to have her train him how to fight so he won't be beaten by that guy who would sacrifice others. A rivalry with Archer brewing? Bring it on!"")

#UBW Day 7

[Choices made:](/s ""give up and go out there, use Command Spell to call Saber"")

- [Day 7](/s ""Shirou has a dream of the field of swords again, but this time his arm feels strange, and when he looks down it seems like it's made of swords. Foreshadowing of his natural healing ability from the sheath?"")
- [Day 7](/s ""Shirou does some morning training with Saber after breakfast, he feels like she's being easier on him than usual but she says she isn't, his technique is much different than yesterday and he is improving already. He's trying to copy Archer's technique now, which disappoints Saber somewhat. Someone's jelly that he is spending more time together with Archer than her! At this rate I could see Shirou try crossing blades with Archer seeing how reckless he is this time around"")
- [Day 7](/s ""At school Shinji is acting weird, he rails on Shirou for acting conceited because he's friends with Rin and has a strong Servant but is glad he came to school so that it wouldn't be boring. I bet he's going to try using his boundary field today"")
- [Day 7](/s ""Lunchtime comes, and Rin is causing a commotion pacing outside Shirou's classroom, clearly pissed at having to wait for him. I decide to give up and go out there to meet her. She takes him to the roof where they awkwardly have lunch together without conversation, until she finally apologizes for what happened last night. She says she used a Command Spell to prevent Archer from attacking him again while they are still cooperating. WHOA girl, that's a big waste of one of your Spells imo! She really takes her strong sense of responsibility seriously"")
- [Day 7](/s ""Shirou accepts her apology, and then they skip class together at her request. OOooOoo! They chat a bit about their history as magi and Rin gives him a rare compliment for training as hard as he does when the risk for him is higher since he started learning at such a late age. Now we just need Cupid to come in and shoot his arrows to complete this date :3"")
- [Day 7](/s ""The two talk a bit more, including Rin mentioning that Shinji approached her that morning about cooperation but she turned him down because she has Shirou already. Then Shirou revealing to her that Shinji is the one setting up the boundary field. Immediately afterwards the boundary field gets activated. Shit, time to deal with this again..."")
- [Day 7](/s ""Shirou and Rin see the students being slowly melted by the field, and I decide to summon Saber using my Command Spell to aid us in the search for Shinji, since Rin left Archer at her home. Saber detects a Servant on the fourth floor while Rin detects the source of the boundary field on the first, so we split up to handle each of them. Saber deals with some bone golems in the hallway and Shirou and Rin run towards the stairs"")
- [Day 7](/s ""On their way down Shirou fights some golems using two chair legs he strengthened with magic, wielding them like he saw Archer wield his swords. You're gonna make either a fine ally or rival for that guy at this rate Shirou! They get to the source of the boundary field in a classroom and confront Shinji, but he is blabbering on about how it wasn't him that killed her. That her being the only non-student lying dead on the floor - Rider. Whoa...what the fuck happened?"")
- [Day 7](/s ""Someone else killed Rider in one blow to the neck. Her boundary field disappears as her body fades away. That was way easier than last time! Rin confronts Shinji and asks him what he saw, but he just blabbers on about how we are going to be the next targets and runs away scared. She just lets him go as he is a ""harmless insect"" now, and then she finally shows how shaken up the situation around her has made her. This reassures Shirou that even though she is a strong magus that can do everything, she is still just a young girl on the inside. They contact help and leave"")
- [Day 7](/s ""Saber confirms she was fighting Caster, and defeated her shadow. Seems like Caster is the big threat we focus on this time around, like Berserker was last time. So Caster killed Rider, maybe by manipulating Shinji like she did to Shirou. That also means her Master must be the fourth one that attends this school. I have a strong feeling that it is Issei since he lives in Ryuudou Temple like she does, and he's been out of energy lately."")
- [Day 7](/s ""The three go to leave via the nearby woods and run into Archer, and Rin berates him for being late. They then discuss what happened, and Archer insults the weak Rider, which riles up Saber hearing him talk ill like that of a heroic spirit. They argue and Saber challenges him to a fight when he says the 'heroes' not fit for this war should be eliminated early on, a subtle jab at Shirou. He can't fight now though because of the Command Spell Rin used, and Rin breaks the two of them up to state their cooperation continues until the other Master at their school is eliminated."")
- [Day 7](/s ""So the plan is to continue searching for Caster's Master at school. Archer notes that her Master must not be operating under his own free will since she would not allow herself to be controlled by someone. They will search for the Master tomorrow and take them out if possible"")
- [Day 7](/s ""Shirou and Saber head home and retire for the night. They agree to have Saber sleep in the room next to his to prevent an incident like last night from happening again. As he goes to sleep Shirou thinks about how Rin reacted to all the bodies back in that classroom, and how she carries the burden of trying to be both a strong magus and a good-natured person at the same time. It makes him want to be a support for her...you're falling for best girl this time around! Atta boy Shirou :)"")


Quick thoughts after this first week: I like this Shirou more, he's idealistic and reckless but he's been more wiling to fight and seems more capable than he did in Fate. I also like that some of the Servants that didn't get much time in Fate are getting their spotlight this time around - Archer, Caster and Assassin to a lesser extent.

"daalvlf","The bike stealing subhuman’s doctrine of defeatism rejects the bike stealing principle of meritocracy and displaces our eternal privilege of consistent bikes and good bikes by their mass of numbers and sheer braindead weight. Thus it denies the value of the non-biker stealers contributions in society, contests the significance of individual actions and superior performance, and thereby withdraws from non-bike thieves the premise of its existence and bike stealing culture.

As a foundation of this Waterloo, this doctrine would bring about the end of any order intellectually conceivable to non-bike thieves, and as, with this greatest of all recognizable organisms, such a pedigree of perfection above that of the subhumans, the result of the indoctrination of such a vulgar law could only be chaos, in this game it could only be destruction for all non-bike thieves.

If, with the help of his denier’s creed, the bike thief is victorious over the other players of the game, his crown will be the funeral wreath of all non-bike thieves, and this world will, as it did in times immemorial, move through the ether devoid of non-bike thieves.

Eternal Lance Armstrong inexorably avenges the infringement of his commands. Hence today I believe that I am acting in accordance with the will of the Almighty Armstrong, and by defending myself from the subhuman, I am fighting for the work of the Lord.

To what an extent the whole existence of this people is based on a continuous cycle of lies and denial is shown incomparably by the non-bike thieve posters of the /r/uwaterloo, so infinitely hated by the subhumans. These degenerates are based upon a forgery, the deniers moan and scream in multitudes every week, belittling and degrading the erstwhile achievements of non-bike thieves. Once these mathematically and logically impaired posters are suppressed, only then can the subhuman menace be considered as broken.

Lord Panino's unfailing instinct in such things scents the denial in every person, and his hostility is assured to anyone who is not truly spirit of his spirit, a denier unable to see his everlasting glory. Since the bike-thief is not the attacked, but the attacker, anyone who attacks or resists his attacks upon the legitimacy of the non-bike thieves reasoning and logic passes as his enemy, regardless of the validity of their arguments. The means of which the subhuman seeks to break such reckless but upright and outstanding souls is not through honest intellectual warfare, but through lies, slander, and shitposting.

Here, he stops at nothing, and in his vileness, his rotten ego and mind becomes so gigantic that no one need be surprised if among non-bike thieves the personification of mental retardation assumes the living shape of the subhuman.

The ignorance of the broad masses about the inner nature of the subhuman, the lack of experience and narrow mindedness of our long time players, makes them an easy victim for this subhuman campaign of statistical moose pie and opinionated lies. The broad masses from stupidity or simplicity believe everything fed to them by the crooked hands of the bike-thieves, while the non-bike thieves authorities either cloak themselves in silence or, in a brave but ultimately futile attempt, they retaliate against them, which in the official eyes of the posters, makes them seem to be a bike stealing whore.

Ever so slowly, the fear and denial of bike-thieves descends like a nightmare on the minds and souls of non-bike thieves, and haplessly, they begin to tremble before the terrible enemy and thus have become his victim. The bike thieves numerical domination in the game seems so assured that now not only can he call himself a subhuman again and be proud of it, but he ruthlessly admits his ultimate game-wide designs, firstly, the brutal and indiscriminate persecution of non-bike thieves, and secondly, the reduction of the ultimate end-game, the outright unilateral persecution of non-bike thieves.

It is a sign of their rising confidence and sense of security that at a time when one section is still playing the American, British, Chinese, French, or German, the other with open effrontery comes out as the bike stealing race. How close they see approaching victory can be seen by the hideous aspect which their relations with the members of the other players take on, intellectual debates exist no longer in face of their awful denial and complete ignorance.

With satanic joy in his face, the shit eating bike-thieves lurks in wait for the unsuspecting non-bike thief whose bikes he defiles with his utterly terrible hands, thus stealing him away from his status and people. With every means, he tries to destroy the foundations of the non-bike thieves he has set out to subjugate. Just as he himself systematically ruins their bikes forever.

Non-bike thieves , a pure people, which is conscious of its violet purity can never be enslaved by the bike thief's wanton desire for bikes. In this world, the bike thief will forever be master over other mentally handicapped players and mouthbreathing welfare warriors alone. And so he tries systematically to lower the discrepancies of the statistical level by a continuous poisoning of non-bike thieves bikes, and in /r/uwaterloo he begins to replace the idea of individual contributions by sheer luck.

In an organized mass of denial, the bike thief has found the weapon which lets his dispense with reason and logic, and in its stead allows his to subjugate and govern the non-bike thief with a dictatorial and brutal fist of proverbial ignorance and lies. He works systematically for revolution in a twofold sense: the elimination of statistics as a measure of individual performance to preserve his delicate ego, and the end of a bikes based upon meritocracy.

Around non-bike thieves who offer too violent a resistance to his insidious ideologies on the forums, thanks to his international influence and carefully weaved outward appearance as the persecuted, incites and rallies his fellow bike thieves to war against non-bike thieves, winning in the end by the sheer volume of bike steals.

In random battles, the bike-thieves undermines the stability of the non-bike thief efforts to survive, and purposefully steals all bikes and attempts to retreat.
In the end, he refutes the idea of a merit-based end-game and demands that any non-bike thief, regardless of how hard they may have worked, how much skill or strategies they may have built up, they should be able to hold land outside of Africa.

In the forums, he contaminates the goodness of non-bike thieves , soils their reputation, and makes a mockery of reason and logic, overthrowing all concepts of beauty and the intellectually sublime, of the noble and good, and instead drags other posters down into the disgusting sphere of his own base animalistic and windowlicking nature.

Intelligence is ridiculed, high performance and desire to improve mocked, until the last props of non-bike thief in its struggle for existence in this world of the bike thief, have at last fallen.

Now begins the great last revolution, in gaining numbers, the bike thieves casts off the few cloaks he still wears, and openly engages the non-bike thieves in series of never-ending verbal jousts that will determine the future of this Waterloo.

The non-bike thieves must fight back, each with the strength and intellectual capacity of ten thousand bike thieves, in order to preserve their existence in this world.",1479790662,"the means of which the subhuman seeks to break such reckless but upright and outstanding souls is not through honest intellectual warfare, but through lies, slander, and shitposting.","reckless but upright","reckless","but",FALSE,"reckless but upright","upright",NA,NA,1

It's pretty open. It reminds of innocence, there is also a girl teacher that take the kids together, so maternal presence, then we get to the kid who lost her mom. It's a very internal scene, he could have hallucinated all of it, it wouldn't matter, the effect is amazing imo, great feels.

The kids are also a great link between scene. Bruce falls into a hole--passes by kids and save one--kids go under water (hole) to get the kryptonite. Recurring motif makes it feel smooth, organic and intimate sotry telling, purely visual.

I won't let them win. I will turn hate into passion and resolve.

But look, we have very very dark times ahead. Most of you don't know what's coming because you were kids under Bush. Hell, we're just a little over a year from a crop of 18 years olds who never knew America before 9.11.

But we can prevail.


You know, a lot of people think this is a team sport. It's not, not for us.

They'll come here and scream that they don't want these things or that they arent racists but I'm speaking to you progressives -you know the truth. We offer *equality* which means the same rights for them. They offer only oppression to all but themselves.

We must fight. Not violently, but legally and morally and with resolve. We can abandon this country to them as some progressives have, refusing to stop them. I felt that way.

We ARE stronger together and we need to calm down, look at our option and start planning. We have hundreds of legal battles ahead and little time before the supreme court won't help us.

Shaky in its first year (because it was a huge project with little budget that had to prove itself) it blossoms into the best show by 2nd and will blow your mind. It was written before it ever began so the writer knew all the secrets ahead of time. No making it up as he went along, its mysteries pay off so well you feel rewarded for watching.

it mirrors a lot of our country's history, including 9/11, but it was on tv before 9/11. At one point, a reckless but beleaguered people are finally conquered by the oppressors they had fought for so long. Someone very much like Trump declares the sanctions against the now enslaved people who want to be free but face a holocaust, their world bombed literally back into the stone age. And one of them faces his oppressor with words I want you to take with us. The right now have everything and despite the talk of peace and healing from them you can bet gays and blacks particularly will find a return to the old days of hard oppression. Take his words with you, with all of us, and take hope and strength. Though science fiction, Babylon 5 speaks to us right now and always did. You should give it a watch. You'll find your hope again.

"d8zykfg","Sasha is great in the ring. A little too reckless, but great nonetheless. She already should be in top 5-10 female wwe talents all time, but over Trish? At this point definitely not. Her promos need quite a bit of work, and she needs to prove she can be an entertaining face. Yes the fans love her, how can you not seeing what she did in nxt, but when she thrived in nxt she was heel. Now on Raw she has transitioned to babyface and to me she kind of took a step back character wise. In damn near every promo she includes a name drop of a legend...or the story about how she's wanted to wrestle since she was little.....or how it's a women's revolution. 

Now if you want to really look at who can surpass Trish already, it's Charlotte. At this point I'd say she is the best all around women superstar wwe has seen yet, and it seems she's gotten better every month since she's debuted. She's freaky athletic and extremely agile in the ring. She does things I've never seen a woman superstar do before (ex. Corkscrew moonsault). She's come a long way on the mic. Her promos went from ehh to very good. And she plays into her role. Her role is to be hated, and she's done a great job getting fan heat and not becoming stale whenever she gets time to talk. And what's unbelievable is she's been on raw for a year and a half and yes I'd be comfortable putting her #1 all time. I highly doubt she'll ever go back to being face which is needed to be marked as the face like Trish was, she might during the end of her career due to the fact everyone will respect her so much. 

And Bayley has the same if not more potential than Sasha does. Hopefully she'll win the strap at mania 33 and her and Sasha put on a classic. But for the next 6 months we'll get to learn a lot about Sasha since she'll inherit the place at the top of the division from Charlotte.

When it really comes down to it Sasha, Charlotte, and Bayley have the potential to take over the top 3, and the fan in me hopes they do seeing as they all can tear it up in the ring.

(I) No Time Like The Present - Move with authority! Not reckless, but clik,clik,clik and you should already be moving. Assuming you had enough space to safely merge in the first place, the person behind you should both (a) not have to react because you moved into the lane and (b) be physically incapable of closing the gap unless they're in a high-end sportscar and paying close attention. If either of these aren't true, they're either doing you a favor or you are cutting them off.

(III) Zen - Are things bumper to bumper and you're actually relying on the kindness of strangers to get into the other lane?  If someone refuses to let you in, see point (II) again.  The next car, or the next one will let you in.

None of it is overbearing and Atlanta definitely is in it's own bubble, but in the end it's still a NE to SE transition and you should expect some adjustment. Main differences from the Northeast: 

1. People are more polite, but sometimes things slow down from people talking so much (mostly a problem interacting with people outside ATL).

2. Drivers are less reckless but overall sometimes less aware (not too much pedestrian traffic here).

3. Better service, cheaper (even in Atlanta), but this is mostly a factor only if you're from an urban area.

"d88tj93","&gt;Since I've tried to be more open minded, I have started smoking weed with my boyfriend. I don't do it often though. 

Good. Each person needs to find out their own comfort level of use, whether its cannabis or alcohol or anything else, and that level can be anywhere from ""every day after work, but only a little"" to ""only on the weekends"" to ""nope, never"". Each person sets their own boundaries, and that's good &amp; healthy. What's right for one person isn't necessarily right for someone else, and it's smart to both set your own boundaries and respect other's. 

&gt;But it was nice for him to hear me thinking positively about it rather than shutting him down completely, which I think would be unfair since I know he enjoys doing it so much. 

For your boyfriend, the MDMA is part of a shared experience with a specific group of people, which is overall a positive thing for him. Some people go out camping with the same group of friends every year and drink beer and go canoe in a mountain lake. Some folks spend every 4th of July drinking whisky and shooting guns at their friend's ranch. Yup, it sounds dumb and risky and reckless, but when you realize that these folks have all been doing this a long time, and they know how to be safe doing it. 

&gt;me trying to be considerate isn't a free pass for him to do what he wants all the time without consequence.

Your past history is full of people who had poor boundaries and trouble with substance abuse, so that's the only model you had for what ""doing drugs"" looked like. It sounds like your boyfriend has good boundaries, knows his limits, and is generally careful about his use, which is something you've never encountered before. 

Watch those boundaries. MDMA once a year at a music festival with friends is not the same as MDMA every weekend. Smoking pot on the weekends, sometimes, isn't the same as eating a pot brownie before work. As long as he's aware of his use, and holding to his own boundaries, he's being OK.  If he starts using other drugs, that's not OK. If his usage changes, that's a problem. So keep your eyes open, but otherwise, things sound OK.

And fighting zombies is gonna be a necessity, when i want supplies and scavenge houses its better to be armed to the teeth, but I'm not gonna go looking for trouble and hunt them, ammo isn't a renewable resource. And yeah, i had a few springs that went missing, but thats not a big issue since it only happened when i was taking the gun apart, i mean every single piece was laid out and meticulously cleaned, lubed as necessary, then put back together; it is better to learn and understand every part of your gun vs understanding the bare minimum of how to maintain the weapon. I've never had a spring fly out from shooting the gun, only when i changed/cleaned parts, like the mag release, the grip, and safety. I've had a few pins and detents disappear, but like i said, it was at the beginning, i've also had parts like a buffer spring that i just misplaced, since i do place things down and forget where i put them, like my phone. pins and detents are harder to find since they're incredible small.

What research? guns aren't complicated and i wouldnt suggest a noob pick one up unless its a dire emergency, i may have lost a few parts, but thats reckless as fuck on your part. They're has to be some form of knowledge prior to giving someone a gun, if you did this for research and had people get black eyes and broken jaws, i find it not only reckless but stupid, what would have happened when an idiot turned when you said something and misfired while muzzlesweeping everyone? 

I built my own rifle, but i still wasn't fully aware of every single part, i never paid much attention to it till i lost springs and parts. Even then, i received instruction from an nra instructor, and that helped teach me how to shoot, firearm safety, and basics. i mostly learned other shit from people and the internet, now I'm not gonna claim it didnt help, but i never was told i was holding the gun wrong, so for me it seemed natural, perhaps it was all the paintball, airsoft, and bb guns that helped me learn the best way but i could probably hold a gun in an uncomfortable position and still shoot it without much difficulty",1474662753,"they're has to be some form of knowledge prior to giving someone a gun, if you did this for research and had people get black eyes and broken jaws, i find it not only reckless but stupid, what would have happened when an idiot turned when you said something and misfired while muzzlesweeping everyone?","reckless but stupid","reckless","but",FALSE,"only reckless but stupid","stupid","only",NA,1

"d7yad32","He felt some small irritation as the [Khajiit](/u/a_friendly_hobo) stepped up and ranted before he had a chance to respond that he was alright. He took a breath as his eyes darkened to a shade just barely lighter than his hair, and let it blow out through his nose. He would admit that had been close... *Fool, you had nearly been killed, along with your companions! Praise Azura for that book!* ... but he didn't feel as though this one small trip should color the rest of their journey! Perhaps next time...

Perhaps next time there would be no book. It was then that he came to realize he wasn't just risking his own life anymore. He was putting both Sah'iir and [Laila's](/u/DizzyRP) lives in danger. He watched as the two scrambled into a quick embrace with one another. His red eyes dimmed from the angry shade of red into a much softer tone. He was wrong to have expected them to be so committed to this path of vengeance that was not their own. They were here as a favor to him, nothing more. And this was not the most direct path for rendering aid. And now they were trapped inside of a Barrow with ghosts and skeletons. The Dunmer let out another sigh.

And they still had things to lose; namely each other. All Davmyn had was himself and his vengeance. He breathed out another soft sigh through his nose, before focusing his attention on the remaining skeletons that were dragging themselves around on the ground. He left the two to their reunion and one hand filled with flames to snap out a fireball at the skeleton furthest from him. He stalked towards the remaining skeleton as it dragged itself across the ground. This was the one that had bitten his boot, and likely damaged it if the way it felt looser around his foot was any indication. He stormed towards the skeleton and lifted his foot, before driving it down on the skull. The echoing crack of bone beneath boot tore through the room.

A frown was twisted across his features and his eyes were burning again. He had found himself staring at something, something that even to his Dunmer sense was wrong and evil. Something that should not be. Something that was a tragedy in a way that only the most depraved would create. Standing across from him was the translucent form of a little girl. She seemed to shy away from Davmyn, and when he took a step forward, the spirit fled with a speed he could scarcely comprehend. The spirit was now gravitating close to Laila and Sah'iir, more closely to the Khajiit than not.

*""Is he a bad elf? Like the tall one?""*

Davmyn rocked back on his heels. This wasn't a spirit like what had trapped them here. This one was... something different. Something more pure in nature. He kept a distance from the now trio, and tilted his head as he called over, ""My companions will tell you I am troublesome and reckless, but I am not 'bad'.""

He did not smile at the spirit child with his face. It seemed far more connected to its prior life and was likely a more recent spirit than not. So, if the spirit still saw itself as a little girl, it would feel like a little girl. He had been once told his smile makes children cry, and Davmyn had no patience for children as it was. Crying children, far less so. Crying spirit children that could easily become hostile? He had not even the slightest bit of interest in them.

*""Sah'iir and Laila, right?""* the girl asked, stepping further behind them. *""You two will help us, right?""

"d7xttfe","It all depends on when the bowl of pineapple was placed on the kitchen table. Personally, I don't think it's unusual for kids this age to go to bed at 1am on Christmas Eve, or Christmas break in general. I remember staying up way past midnight and likely 1am on Christmas Eve and whatnot. Playing games and snacking and whatnot with our parents. Around the same age. No bed time.

Regardless, we know JB ate the pineapple 40-60minutes before she died. This was probably the amount of time Burke had to panic his ass off and figure out how to avoid trouble for 'knocking out' his sister in what was probably a reckless, but cruel accident. If the parents were out of site and preoccupied as we believe they were, Burke would have had easy and quick access to the basement, whihc would be the quickest way to hide what he had done. This especially as he became more desperate in the early moments of Jonbenet remaining motionless and silent. His adrenaline is pumping. And yes, it's also possible JB ran into the basement while being pursued by Burke who conked her out there, but it's impossible to know and mostly irrelevant. 

I'm guessing Burke spent the better part of 20-30 minutes prodding her and shaking her body in the basement. As his desperation and panic continued to unfold, he grabbed an object and poked her with what was probably the toy railroad track really, really hard, hoping to stir her awake. Seeing as there was no blood or visible injuries, Burke may have genuinely thought she was 'knocked out', like in TV and film and figured if he could get her awake, he wouldn't get in trouble. My best guess is that once enough time passed, Burke went and told his parent/s that something bad happened. It's from this point forward that the parents react and cover for the family, spending a number of hours staging the body and manipulating the crime scene. It would have taken me a couple hours to write the ransom note, so it's easy to see how much time passed before the Ramseys contacted authorities. They had quite a bit of thought and work put into this. Sure, the narrative was bogus and made little sense, but that's the best they could do in the time they had. You can't let a body sit too long or it looks bad, right? 

On a side note, I have a hard time believing Burke has ever given his parents the full truth of how he accidentally killed her, though I do believe they know Burke caused it to happen. The problem I have with John and Patsy putting her in the basement is that it wouldn't explain the railroad track 'taser' markings that occurred after she was deceased. And for me to believe that, I would then have to believe that John or Patsy made the marking from a nearby basement object (the railroad track) to throw off investigators. How, I'm not sure, so I have to believe that the marking was made before Patsy and John knew what had happened to her.  It was everything that happened after which was staged by them. They simply kept Burke out of the spotlight and came up with a false narrative.",1474570742,"this was probably the amount of time burke had to panic his ass off and figure out how to avoid trouble for 'knocking out' his sister in what was probably a reckless, but cruel accident.","reckless, but cruel","reckless","but",TRUE,"reckless , but cruel","cruel",NA,NA,1

"d7kgzlz","I addressed your points. But I have no problem repeating myself

The fact that Bernie brought home a flag from Russia? People who don't care about Clinton destroying 13 blackberries aren't going to care about that.

The fact that he praised the Sandanista government? I watched the video. It isn't damning and you know it. 

Don't pretend the vast majority of the population would even flinch at an adv with Bernie saying ""... China has a better culture..."" They didn't flinch when they heard Hillary had a private server while being SoS. And then ***Deleted*** those emails when she was subpoenaed! 

Now all of the above is just me answering you. I'm being fair and addressing your concerns even though I consider to be a side consideration.  My argument is about the voters and how they behave.  And I know you're probably going to deflect again but let me break it down.


**Point 1** Trump is currently supported by a large group of individuals that we can call Anti-Hilary/Anti-paid for politicians. Maybe that group is 25% of his support. Maybe it's 5%. Let's be conservative and call it 5%

**Point 2** Last poll I saw (which was before Hillary's fainting) had trump down 7 %

**Point 3** Had Sanders (^or ^Biden ^or ^Gore ^or ^Warren ^or...) ran instead, that 5% ""Anti-Hillary group"" who supported trump. Would not exist. Because as Anti-Hillary implies, they are voting against Hillary as opposed to for trump.

**Point 4** Without that 5%. Sanders is up 17%. Given the fact that Clinton is currently up 7%. (Again I'm still using the latest poll I saw, which had Hillary up 7%)

But this assumes all other things are equal. This assumes that the only thing that has really changed are those ""Anti-Hillary"" voters. But we don't live in a vacuum. Suppose Sanders ran a really bad campaign?

Now I think we can agree, Clinton has had a horrible campaign. She's avoiding press conferences, was probed by the God-damn FBI who more or less said ""Yeah, she should have never done that, seems incredibly dangerous and reckless. But I don't think she should not be charged because, um, just because"". Wikileaks is releasing damning internal reports. There's the destroyed blackberries, the missing emails the ""i didn't know C meant confidential."" Finally it looks like she's pretty sick. Is it Parkinson's? Is it Pneumonia? Are there head injury complications? I don't know, but we do know she's very sick. So sick she's avoiding the press at all costs.

Which leads me too **Point 5** Unless the Sanders is caught burning the American flag he would be doing at least as well as Clinton at this point. Probably better. 

Look at the news. It's okay to not stand for the anthem now. Sorry, let me correct myself. You're applauded and ""brave"" if you kneel. Praising some country in Nigeria that no one has heard of? Do you think that's going to be the smoking gun that ruins the Sanders campaign?

For the sake of brevity I'm going to wrap this up and skip the rhetorical questions. Clearly Sanders would have ran a better campaign. He would promise everyone free health/education/new infrastructure etc and the country would eat it up. 

Clearly the anti-hillary would favor Sanders over trump. 

So Clearly Trump would have had a much harder time against Sanders as opposed to Clinton.

"d7jczmi","Good job making the switch from Hunter. I was a hunter main but the top dogs now are Voidwalker, Stormcaller and Striker. 

-I would say stick with Voidwalker. It's one of the most balanced classes. Any time you are trying to improve it is best to stick to one subclass and weapon loadout. This will make it very easy to switch to Storm if you so choose ( amazing shotgun class ). 

In regards to your trouble with Titans, I would say you need to have very good map awareness and positioning to master the class. You don't have warlock melee to accompany shotgunning so if you make a push you have to know you are going to get the kill. Titan skating also takes a lot of practice. 

-Rumble is going to be really beneficial to you in improving your gun skill. Don't go into the matches with the mindset to win ( which is often over aggressive and reckless ) but instead just to practice your primary 1v1s. Try to keep that shotgun on your back as much as possible. You will also want to do some 3v3 ( any mode is fine really ) and learn when to use your primary and secondary. These games are when you should practice teamwork and have the goal to win the match. 

-Rumble. Take your time lining up your shots, try to stay calm and switched on. When your gun skill improves you will be able to engage in 1v1s and not lose your cool, meaning you can fire faster and nail those headshots which will nab you the win. 

-Yes. This is a meta loadout, and therefore staying in your comfort zone is going to mean you will be able to see the improvements in your game and not just fluctuations as you change your loadout every week. My only other suggestion is try out hand cannons ( Mid Rof ) as they pair well with shotguns. Hand cannons are all about sticking to cover which is a great skill to practice when shotgunning. You will also be a lot closer to your enemy with a hand cannon meaning you won't have to cross half the map to get in shotgun range. I also find it a lot easier not getting sniped when I am well within pulse/hand cannon range. 

Conclusion: you have already picked up on the most important things for you to improve, so now it's just about going about and doing it. Go into every match with a few goals that you can achieve. For example making sure you only get into 1v1s, or practicing where your reticle is when you scope in, or making sure you always have an escape route ect. Lastly you are using a very strong subclass and loadout in the current meta, so don't feel the need to change it.

"d6dnoht","I've read through the paper ""Criminalization of HIV transmission:
poor public health policy"", and quite frankly I question whether you yourself have read it...

One of the very first things it says is that there are appropriate times for a person to be prosecuted for exposing others to HIV. 

Of course, the beginning of the article is littered with abhorrent examples of misuse of the law and obvious cases of corruption on the part of police and judges alike. I won't even begin to comment on the significance of the laws in places like Sierra Leone or Zimbabwe, they have almost no bearing on us in Canada. 

I thought it would be obvious that I, and everyone else in this discussion, would vehemently oppose the misuse of these laws to unjustly increase the severity of a person's crime because of their HIV status. I *never* advocated for such oppression. 

The article raises some interesting points. It seems the author is torn about if the victim contracted the virus should play a role in sentencing. In fact, they go so far as saying

&gt;""The defendant, in other words, was convicted for conduct that was patently reckless toward others, but which had no confirmed deleterious results. **The complainants’ freedom from HIV infection is surely significant.** It makes it necessary to ask for what the defendant was being punished: **Was it for his bad attitude, his bad deeds or their bad consequences?**""

In fact, I would say that the defendant is being punished for his bad deeds irregardless of the consequences. I think that this is consistent with how we treat other crimes, the maximum sentences for attempted murder and aggravated assault resulting in death are, as far as I know, the same. 

Their comment seems to be that the victims's freedom from infection should be significant, while I say it is not. It is inconsequential. If someone in another unrelated trial shot someone with an intent to kill, they should receive the same sentence whether they succeed or not. Note: I am not equating the two crimes being discussed, merely how the outcomes of two actions should effect the consequences. 

They even go on to say: 

&gt;""Sometimes luck plays a determining factor in the fair application of the law. Two people may
engage in the same reckless but unintentional behaviour; one may have the bad luck that accidentally a bad consequence ensues, while the other may have the good fortune to come through without incident. In the first situation, a tragedy ensues and criminal charges can be brought; but in the other, where no harm occurs, **there should ordinarily be no charge, unless we now wish to equate non-disclosure of HIV in sex with crimes like drunk driving, which are punished even when no bad consequence ensues. I would suggest that is excessive and unwarranted.**""

This sentiment is so, so wrong. Their argument seems to imply that people who are driving drunk should be charged on the basis of whether they cause harm to other people without regard for the fact their actions are actively placing other people in harms way. 

If this is not what they are implying, then they made a mistake to compare the two scenarios because I think it is an excellent one. 

A person who drives drunk actively makes a decision to do something they know is reckless and may result in either harm to themselves or others. Those people should be held responsible for their to the same degree regardless of whether or not they hurt somebody else because *if they did not, it was luck, not any attempt on their part to minimize the risk of harm to others.*

In fact the comparison only strengthens my position on the matter because drunk driving causes a significant risk to the person committing the crime in addition to those around them. Failing to disclose your status as an untreated, HIV+ individual carries no personal risk except that they may face consequences if they are caught. 

I appreciate the nuances of the arguments presented here, but ultimately, it is clear that this paper was written with a clear bias. They tried to use cases of obvious police and judicial corruption to invalidate the need to laws that prosecute people who intentionally spread HIV by failing to disclose their status when they have a significant change of transmitting it to their partner. 

I absolutely abhor the misuse of laws meant to protect us as people to hand out unjust punishments. But, I think you should follow the author of this paper's advice (as misguided as the majority of it may be) and recognize that there is a time and place where these prosecutions are necessary and legitimate.

PS. I am still waiting to see *any* evidence that these laws have caused an increase in HIV transmission or that they will make people reluctant to seek treatment.

If that cruise ship had sunk, the shock in the UK would have been massive. It's not just a question of whether the UK could technically have continued the war. It's a question of whether there would have been any political will to do so.

Thatcher would have come under massive criticism for endangering so many British lives over some remote and largely useless islands, and her government would almost certainly have fallen. In hindsight, she was incredibly lucky that something like this didn't happen. It was a very reckless move on her part to launch the expedition.

The idea of going to war to retain Hong Kong would have been not just reckless, but complete lunacy. The PLA would have overrun the city in a few hours, and there's no way the UK would have been able to muster an expeditionary force to take it back. Besides, after such a conflict, what would owning Hong Kong be worth? Who would do business there?

As for the UK's ability to project force today, it's pretty marginal, especially anywhere near the Chinese coastline. The British navy would be incredibly foolhardy to sail within a few hundred kilometers of the Chinese coast in a time of war. It would get ripped to shreds rather quickly.

"d663n4i","Thanks for your posting.  You may have had a ""pretext"" stop, where the officer used what wasn't a violation of the law, i.e., having a red solo cup in your hand, or potentially trespassing (it's not clear if you were on private property, or public lands, or in a state or federal park, which usually prohibit alcohol consumption).  

You definitely have a potential defense in that the officer was the one that asked you to drive, and there is at least some caselaw in California where that is incorrect (and technically takes away the voluntary nature of the act, although that is highly fact dependent).

For most counties in California, the prosecutor has a policy that anything at or below a .12% alcohol level, they will consider a wet reckless.  But even that is not hard and firm, and it's better to show a legal defense, or a factual problem in the case as leverage to negotiate the case below a DUI. 

I'm not sure a wet and reckless is better for you than a DUI, as it has the same amount of points, a similar fine and alcohol school, and is priorable just as a DUI is if you ever got another one (and so is treated exactly like a DUI).  But a reduction to a dry reckless, or any infraction, would definitely be better. 

If you plead no contest to a DUI, assuming no priors, you would get the minimum or close to it - three years probation, the first time offender alcohol school, and a fine and fees of $390 plus taxes.  

If you conducted discovery, and issued a subpoena or other request for the patrol car video, you can know for sure if the cop saw you hit the yellow line twice, and prove you didn't put a case of beer in your truck. If you then file a motion to exclude evidence, that could cause a dismissal or a reduction of charges.  Weigh that time and effort vs what you know you will get if you plead guilty (above). 

All the best.

Ethical journalism is a well-developed field that has already undergone intense research and scrutiny over the years. As such, we know that *the way in which* events are portrayed by the media can have profound ramifications for how the news is received by the public.

For example, failing to report suicide in a responsible manner can provoke bouts of what is known as [suicide contagion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copycat_suicide) - waves of suicides that propagate through communities (such as schools).

There is very strong evidence that adherence to certain guidelines can prevent this phenomenon from happening before it ever begins. There are dos and donts that reputable news outlets adhere to, such as: **do** inform people of warning signs to look out for in friends and family, **don't** publicise suicide letters.

With regard to these latest tragic events, the way they are being reported is whipping people up in to a frenzy in a manner that is not only reckless, but needless. They can deliver facts without doing the terrorists jobs for them - spreading fear.

As an example of what I mean, there are lots of media outlets that are clamoring to break the news the moment they hear something juicy. They're reporting all of the worst case scenarios they can get their hands on before any reasonable attempt at verification of reports can be made. They're splashing these events on to front pages with full-width spreads to give maximum possible coverage, and drooling at the consideration of ""even worse events yet to come"", and they spend days or weeks drip-feeding the public with intimate details of the attackers' personal life in a fashion not at all dissimilar from heroification.

While its true that some of these did not achieve full independence, they at the very least led to reforms within Britain that allowed independence. Also as for the american ""War of independence""(It was actually a civil war, over 100,000 loyalists who had been born and raised in the colonies had to flee the country) would have been lost had it not been for the support of the French, Spanish and Dutch. The war ended up being effectively a world war for Britain, so they were no longer able to focus solely on the colonies. The people fighting for independence were getting absolutely destroyed prior to the intervention of other countries, and even after that were being destroyed until a reckless but ultimately successful move by the french in capturing control of Chesapeake Bay. Also the countries of europe never just agreed to give up there colonies with the exception of very few of the colonies, they just didnt have to manpower after the world wars to hold off the rebellions that occured(See Portugal and Mozambique/Angola)(See France and Vietnam/Algeria).
* 2. America has effectively been at war since WW2. They are the new colonial power, having bases in most countries on the planet. They are what Britain was between 1815 and 1914, viewing itself as a sort of world police.

* 3. This may be news to you but a vast majority of the world no longer likes or respects america. I used to think it was a great country but I've since realised its really just a gun crazed mixing pot of cultures, that sooner or later, is going to explode. When it gets to a point that a country thinks its ok to put phone taps on its allies leaders and then be stupid enough to be caught doing it, you know theyve been corrupted. Also when EU has won/done well before, they were only playing with imports once. Huni and Reignover were the first non EU players to play on an EU team at worlds(Im including M5 as European as all of them came from either Armenia or the european part of Russia). Hell even this year, you have Gamsu, Spirit, Trick and maybe Expect provided he performs well going to worlds. Depending on who gets the 3rd spot(Likely Origen from their spring split points, who are full EU) you might add one more korean into the mix. So 4 players, none of which are the best in their role in the region bar Trick. We havent seen enough of Expect to judge, but as for Spirit and Gamsu you can hardly say they have been hard carrying Fnatic. Sure Spirit does very well, but hes hardly solo carrying, and Gamsu's literally only there because Spirit requested him(They were both on I believe SSB, where Gamsu was a sub). Now lets check out the top teams on NA. TSM is undoubtedly carried by Bjerg(EU) and this split Sven(EU) has stepped up. Sure DB is really good, but you cant deny Bjerg is carrying fairly hard. C9 admittedly has Sneaky, but the real carry of that team is Jensen(EU) and they also have Impact(KR). Immortals have Huni(KR) and Reignover(KR), while CLG have Huhi(KR/EU). If it wasnt for those pesky rules riot imposed, NA would literally just be EU LCS second division with a touch of korean soloQ. Why do you think theres literally never been an NA import into EU?

"d4piv5c","I'm currently rewatching the show and have watched up to the beginning of season 2. I have never understood the intense Lori hate in the show, even after reading many people's criticisms about her. Sure she made several mistakes and can be inconsistent and reckless but she is not devoid of merits. All of this just makes her a normal human being. 

She's a careless mum, lots of mums get careless when stress and emotions get in the way. She doesn't want her young son handling guns - I think this is logical, albeit stupid in those times, but many mums, especially over-protective ones, would surely freak out to see their kid near a deadly weapon, even if it's meant for self-defence.

About her turning Rick and Shane against each other, my memory is a bit weak on this part (haven't seen it in my re-watch yet). But I believe when she was talking about asking Rick to do something about Shane, she meant Shane needs to go, not to be killed, so she was shocked to learn that he's dead. 

I do agree with what you said about her jumping to the conclusion that Shane lied to her about Rick's death. I disliked that part about her too and it made me feel bad for Shane. I believe that's her way of coping with her own guilt. Not a great way to do so, but it's a common coping mechanism. That would also possibly explain her inconsistent treatment of Shane. First she wanted him to stay away from her and Carl. Later, she chides him for blowing off Carl. Obviously she doesn't know what she wants. It happens with many people.

She cares for the weak (i.e. Carol in the first season). She was angry when Shane didn't put up signs outside Atlanta City to warn people away from it. She speaks up for Rick. She sacrificed herself for her unborn child. Her words at her deathbed to Carl was to do the right thing. Not to survive by whatever means possible, but to do the right thing, which I think is quite telling of her character. She hasn't done anything with deliberate malicious intent. I also can't remember what she has done that makes her come across as thinking she is superior to others. Many people tend to be headstrong about their beliefs, that doesn't automatically make them condescending.

I'm not trying to be a Lori apologist here. I'm definitely not saying she's a great character deserving of many fans. Of course most people love badasses who are physically / mentally strong. She just happens to be very human, and her flaws are more visible than other characters'. Haters talk about her like she's worthless, and I don't understand it. She has moments that make her dis-likeable, but I also found likeable points about her. I appreciate her for being a complex character that makes many people want to talk about her.

Carol of early seasons and Andrea were hated too for doing and saying stupid things and being weak, but in situations comparable to real-life, I doubt many people would fare better than these characters.",1467005840,"sure she made several mistakes and can be inconsistent and reckless but she is not devoid of merits.","inconsistent and reckless","reckless",NA,FALSE,"inconsistent and reckless","inconsistent",NA,NA,0

"d4lyp0u","I'm not going to hate one you, you are entitled to your opinions. But if you are interested allow me to try and articulate why it is people enjoy moaning in general. Now first and foremost we can talk about energy. The strongest aspect of music in my opinion is how it makes you feel. When we are talking about rock and metal, those feelings are meant to be angsty, anger, power just very strong visceral feelings. Just like at any concert, being surrounded by a group of people who are also using the music to channel these same feelings intensifies them. And when those feelings are ones as primal and physical as what rock and metal makes you feel, then it actually helps to channel them and feel them out through a physical activity. A violent physical activity at that. This is the beauty of moshing though. Because it gives you this outlet of these feelings, but Is able to keep that community feeling that you get from being with like-minded people, by allowing you to participate in this activity that is violent and aggressive, but not at any one person in particular and not for any particular reason. It just allows you to have real human outlets to slam into and bash, without actually causing a confrontation, or for the most part really directly hurting anyone. It's not about trying to be as hardcore as possible, it's about channeling what the music makes you feel in as primal a way as possible. This to me is why I enjoy moshing. I can slam into another human being with all my force, I can feel everything and anything that stresses me that I have built up inside me and release in such a satisfying way, accompanied by people doing the exact same thing, without any fear, or social stigma against it. And it's not just about hitting its about getting hit. So yes, on the outside it seems stupid and unnecessarily reckless, but it's simply the chosen outlet for that type of person.

"d4i0n83","Largely the same at the end of episode 13? Her ""moral/law-abiding"" goes out the window in the Finale. As exemplified by her long-term arc with Lowell, Liv grows more revengeful and more willing to ""play god"". Yes, her Zombie-Superheroine shtick gave her confidence to be a good person after her dreams of becoming a doctor died, but as she dallied with Lowell and became more brazen with her crime-fighting, Liv was **making decisions that were either bad choices or not decisions for her to make**.

The biggest decisions was choosing to keep Major in the dark about Meat Cute and then *willingly* institutionalising him in that mental ward. When Major was having his downward spiral, Liv didn't intervene because she thought as the resident superheroine, she knew *best* for him. Although she was trying to protect him and had good intentions, Liv's decision-making cost Major in a *Major* way. He lost most of his sanity.

And *then* Liv does the ultimate act of ""playing God"" by **turning Major into a zombie**. Never mind what *Major* wanted and his hatred for zombies: Liv, not to blame her, was thinking selfishly and wanted Major to live because she loved him. In the beginning episodes, Liv was cautious, timid, and less willing to make hard choices. The Finale has not only ONE tough decision, though, but also ANOTHER. By turning Major into a zombie against his own will, Liv plays God and ruins his life in a huge way.

Rose McIver really sells Liv's growing horror at what she had done. In her despair after Lowell's death, Liv had grown more brazen and reckless and ""empowered"" to make these tough calls. She has these powers, ergo she has the agency to make these decisions. And responding to Blaine required Liv to become **a ""badass""**... but that character arc led her to overlook what **MAJOR** wanted. Throughout S1, Liv was constantly making decisions which did not benefit Major and were actually hurting him. Why? Because she thought she knew best, and the further her confidence as a crime-fighter grew, the more Liv thought that she knew best.

She was wrong, though. And Major's anguish at being a zombie brings that story full circle for her, when Liv desperately tries to undo her terrible decision by **PLAYING GOD AGAIN**... giving Major the last zombie cure which *she* wanted for herself. Yes, Liv was making a selfless choice and was being heroic, but her decision to give Major the cure, to quote Rob Thomas, ""represents the biggest character flaw that Liv gained in Season 1: in the process of becoming a zombie crime-fighter, she forgets the importance of letting others make their own choices and mistakes"". She once again did not ask what Major wanted... maybe he actually *wanted* to die as a zombie, instead of living again?

The fatality of Liv's mistake culminates in her brother requiring a blood transfusion. Because Liv did not take the cure for herself, she cannot give her brother a transfusion without turning him into a zombie. But **within the Finale itself, she exemplifies character development:** in a singular powerful moment, Liv does *not* give her brother the transfusion because it is not her place to decide whether her brother should become a zombie or not.

As a medical student, I am constantly faced with the ""playing god"" phenomenon that doctors must face. Liv, during her time as a doctor, was a lawful ""do-gooder"" for whom a life of doing good for others was wrested away by Zombie-ism. When she finds a new avenue through which she could help others by becoming a zombie crimefighter, Liv embraces the opportunity. In the process, she sheds her reluctance to break the rules or bend the laws of consent, though. Partially, this change is **driven by the antagonistic force of Blaine**. But mainly, Liv spirals towards this god-complex through her own happiness and elation at being... useful. That's the tragedy of Liv's character arc: **she develops as a person and gains confidence**, growing more empowered and reckless... but she starts making decisions on the behalf of other people (forcing Lowell to confront Blaine; institutionalising Major; keeping Peyton in the dark), which backfire on her in a twisted, horrible way.

I get that you dislike iZombie, but the show's balancing of Liv's character arc which is *subtle* but tragic is the reason why I love the show. Liv makes all the wrong choices, but we *understand* her motivations for making them: she is an actualised character with tangible thoughts and dreams. And damn, sometimes, you can have the best intentions but ruin things for everybody.

Liv doesn't have big, over-the-top ""CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT"" moments, which Stephen King derisively labels ""magic epiphany nuggets"". Instead, the show is more subtle. No, she doesn't freak out automatically about Lowell. But the ramifications *are* there. Post-Lowell, Liv *is* more reckless, she is more revengeful, and ultimately, she screws up the Major situation in such a such way because she does not think and assess the situation without myopia. The development is there: the show just doesn't hit us over the head with it.",1466520407,"that's the tragedy of liv's character arc: **she develops as a person and gains confidence**, growing more empowered and reckless... but she starts making decisions on the behalf of other people (forcing lowell to confront blaine; institutionalising major; keeping peyton in the dark), which backfire on her in a twisted, horrible way.","empowered and reckless","reckless",NA,FALSE,"more empowered and reckless","empowered",NA,"more",0

"d3x9mbq","Rain falling from the moonless night sky christens me this 3rd Thursday of March. I've been on the lamb since Tuesday. My orange jumpsuit has been moderately tattered and stained with my own blood and that of another's since escaping from my prison cell in the middle of the night. 

What do I expect to happen once I reach the top of Preacher's Rock? Surely the law will be sending up a chopper in the morning when things clear out. I had better find some shelter and fast. The barking hounds had been muffled by the sudden rain, which I was very grateful for. My scent would be washed away with any luck. 

Luckily for me, an opening appears in the side of this old Appalachian mountain. Not questioning my luck, I hurry inside. I light a turpentine laced match as I make my way deeper into the cave. I’m certainly glad Jenny was able to get them to me. The matches burn quick and I begin to worry about losing my light source until I find an old miner's lantern hanging on the side of the rock facing by a nail. Luckily for me, it was full of oil.

Slowly I continue my descent into the granite belly of the beast. Interestingly enough, old building materials line the ever narrowing corridor until I reach a dilapidated wooden door with rusty hinges. It’s a dead end unless I want to open the door to see what lies below. . . 

Fighting back the urge, I sit on a grounded piece of granite that had chipped off of the corridor wall. 

“Meh,” I thought to myself, “I might as well just stay here. I’m adequately protected from the elements, I’m out of view of the chopper come morning, and I’ve been pretty lucky up to this point, so why push it.” 
 
I make myself comfortable on the rocky ground and close my eyes for a little shuteye. I have been awake for nearly three days straight, after all. 

Just as I am beginning to lull, a slow, high-pitched scratching noise begins running down the length of the door frame from within the mountain. The noise continues to run up the length again, this time from the bottom and comes to a stop. 

A silence follows. 

“FUCK THAT SHIT.” 

I quickly begin my retreat back from where I came. The rain has stopped. The cave opens to a canvas of green shrubbery largely undisturbed except for a distinct man sized depression in the foliage that perfectly leads to my location. I catch the distant sound of the dogs picking up the trail once again. “Fuck me.”

Into the cave I go. No! I hesitate and walk back to the entrance. What the hell was that noise from inside the mountain? Surely just an anomaly of some sort. Air pressure or some form of wildlife. Resolved, I rapidly descend into Preacher’s Rock with newfound determination. “If I go back out there, they will shoot me on sight,” I thought. 

I begin to gather half rotten planks and timbers on my way back to the door, praying that I will be able to barricade myself inside the passageway. I try my hand at the door. It gives way with a second push and swings open. Nothing but darkness greets me as I enter the corridor with my supplies. The floors are made of granite slab, perfectly squared off like one of my son’s Minecraft games. No time to waste. I pull my timbers into the corridor and scoop up a hammer and nails from the stacks of building supplies outside. 

I place the lantern at my back and begin working to barricade myself within the mountain. My silhouette is cumbersome to work in, but I haven’t the time to move my lantern. After affixing five or six planks I can hear the dogs barking at the mouth of the cave. I turn and drop my hammer to the ground with a reckless but probably unobserved clang and blow out my lantern, all the while hoping and praying they did not hear my thunderous strikes of metal to nail or that there was yet some way to get out of this mess. 

I hear the approach of the canines, and then the voice of the Warden. “He’s in there all right. Look at the bastards muddy footprints all over the place.” His southern drawl is unmistakable. 

A sheriff’s deputy speaks up. “Sir, do you want me to pursue?” 

They have me now, but perhaps that isn’t the worst fate. The hairs on the back of my neck begin to rise. Something inside this mountain is amiss. An echo crashes behind me, reverberating gently into my ears. I lower my stance and begin palming the floor for my hammer.
“Now, now,” said the Warden, “Why don’t you just call your boss and let him know we found him. Head out to the mouth of the cave and see if you can’t get a signal.”

“Yes, Sir.” 

“In fact, I’ll come with you son. No need to split up at a time like this, of course. Besides… If the Preacher is home, we may not have to go in and get him after all. He may be coming to us.” The deputy made an attempt at a laugh.

I breathe out an icy sigh of relief. Alone in the darkness, I begin to fumble around for the discarded lantern and hammer. They aren’t here. Face down to the floor, I crawl and turn toward the abyss in search of my discarded tools, until I have clearly passed even the farthest possibility of their resting place. They have been moved. The darkness disorients me as I turn into a wall, running my hand over the surface until I luckily feel the corner of the passage and the familiar texture of wood. 

A foreboding doom covers my entire being from somewhere deep inside- of me, or this mountain?. A primal need to run, to disperse back from whence I came, begins to take hold in me. Keep it together. Keep it together. This could be much worse than being shot. 

“Wait!” I yell with a bang on the wood, “Come back!” I did a hell of a job with these wooden beams. It is useless to try and tear them out with my bare hands. I cry out with all of my might. Exasperated, I lay my forehead into the wood. My breathing centers. I exhale as I shut my eyes, for what purpose, I do not know. The darkness has already consumed what little incentive I may have found to close my eyes. There is no relief. Only more darkness. 

What is that? Lightly, ever so gently, a bug- small: a spider, beetle or an ant begins running down the back of my neck from my hairline to the collar of my jumpsuit. At this point, I could really care less. In a way, it’s really a reassurance that everything is all right. This is real life where bugs and shit do things like that all the time. This ain’t no horror show.

There it is again. At the edge of my hairline. Not where it stopped moving? Puzzled, I realize that this isn’t an insect. My eyes open wide in sheer terror to the realization that the next carrass, for that is what this is, does in fact have the shape and consistency of a fingernail. Four fingernails, very long, curved, fingernails begin cascading in unison down the length of my neckline and over my spine. 

Before I can spin about, another set grip my face, just below my chin, while the first set slides into position behind the crown of my head. A quick jerk and then… darkness. Unending and insatiable darkness descends… along with me, into the mountain.

"d3qh3go","&gt;*It's hard to really know what the language means here, pale or stark, clinging or attachment.*

Yes, indeed. That's why proper practice is necessary, to weed out misconception, opinion, agitation -- all the obscuring factors -- and to gradually refine the perception. And it's also why one requires a proper guide, one who has traveled that territory (that is, a master who knows the Bardos) and who can point out the routes and roadblocks with certainty.

&gt;*But the problem with one great dive is you don't know where it ends up.*

That just shows that it's not yet a 'great' dive, one that goes beyond ego, beyond clinging and projecting and fearing.

 &gt;*I mean, there's this sense of - what if....*

This shows a propensity to making stories. There's not only agitation, but too much mental activity, too much *making* dreams. This either needs to be calmed down in a proper course of meditative training, with a good training situation and group and teacher, or maybe first addressed with psychotherapy.

If you venture into darkness with a strong habit of projecting stories and dreams onto real experience it could go very badly for you.

There are many meditation teachers who are also psychotherapists. This might be an ideal resource for you. Don't try to figure it out on your own; at this point, you are not capable of controlling your dreaming mind.

Trying to solve psychological problems by inventing one's own meditation practice is a reckless, but surprisingly common, mistake.

According to the concerns and reactions evident in your writing, most important for you at this juncture is to get clear. Don't mess around with dreams and Bardos and fears of imagined situations. Develop the ability to return to this plain reality, right here and now. Get grounded. Get your feet on the ground in a very real, very simple sense.

A practice that goes into dream worlds and Bardos presupposes a tremendous command of one's mind -- a great, uncommon ability to return to basic reality. Can you see the color of the sky? Can you hear the sound of your computer? Can you feel your feet on the ground? It's this return to basic, uncontrived reality that forms the foundation for the other practices. And many masters never choose another practice and bring this simple presence to full fruition, and become enlightened through it.

"d3nu56s","That's a great question.  I think it depends on the outcome.  If the Barbarian is reckless but low INT, I absolutely could see him walk up and start putting rune stones in spots because he's lost patience with the Wizard who is currently skimming through his lore book because this seems familiar.  

But the Barb shouldn't get the solution right, even if the high INT Player actually did solve it.

In case of the latter... to me, this is purely Table RP preference.  I encourage these sorts of things to be RP'd out in-character so I'd rather not Players have an OoC discussion about an in-game puzzle/problem because it destroys immersion.  But I wouldn't say that my way is right and OoC is wrong.  It just doesn't fit, tonally, with our game.  And it works for my Players.

Our Wizard's first inclination is to set shit on fire, whether it's a puzzle or a Gnoll.  The Barb, who was a pirate in his background, is a bit more methodical (he RPs against the Hulk Smash rage cliche) so they resolve these approaches largely in-character and RP them out.  Which I love.

So I don't think OP is doing it wrong.  It would just somewhat tonally off-putting in my game.

Here's an example.  My PCs fought off ""bodyguards"" for their first major nemesis - pair of Animated Armor.  And then chased off the nemesis (a Drider).  To give the Animated Armor a bit more depth and intrigue, I placed a set of twin black metal toy knights in the Drider lair.  I didn't call specific attention to it.  Just one of the many odd items in this place.

Our Monk, who has low INT and Arcana, was actually the first one to make the connection between the figurines and the animated armor.  So he picked them up and made an Arcana check to control them.  But, he's a Monk. He has no arcana training whatsoever.  And to top it off, he rolled a 19.

So it was somewhat of a pickle.   I told him that he took 1 point of necrotic damage from the figurines to his hands  because there is some sort of power residing in the figurines, but the nature of that power was beyond his training.    The wizard, surprise surprise, wanted to set them on fire.  But everyone RP'd this out and eventually talked the Wizard into trying to make an arcana check.  Which he passed and then assembled the pieces of the Animated Armor into a large metal Centaur that he can command.

Now, kudos to my 17 year old son (the Monk) who figured it out (I keep telling him he should be a mage rather than a mystic) and even though he, as a Player, intuitively guessed the precise nature of the figurines, the character just couldn't have made that call.  So I had to thread a delicate needle.  I didn't want to punish him for his curiosity (or for being exactly right) but I wanted to convey to him in-game to his character that he was on the right path, but not properly trained to figure out what it was.

We can go on and on about the ""free market"", I don't believe it exists. This is an entirely different topic that we can discuss endlessly, so we will unfortunately have to agree to disagree here.


&gt;You failed to mention my point regarding tvs or books.. or how about mafia documentaries?

These are all companies profiteering off of the victims of crime. By law, a criminal cannot profit from their crimes, yet these people can. For most it's a grey area, for me it isn't. If criminals can't, then nobody can. Journalism has fallen so far that these people are licking their lips as soon as they hear about a murder, jumping at the chance to interview the victim's relatives. It's sick, depraved, and just because these people are fed to you through a screen it is somewhat acceptable. It isn't. 

Everything I viewed was for free on youtube or streaming websites. The few books that I bought, for instance ""The Iceman"" were so full of total bullshit that I could not even consider giving these people any more money.

&gt;They, according to you, are feeding off victims.
And with your last statement, you've truly shown how naive you are. You think every victim of the mafia was some guy who owed them money? What about the shops that have to pay protection money? What about the BILLIONS of taxpayer and private money wasted due to their schemes? "" the balls to do it"" Absurd.

This all ties in to my original point. If a criminal can't legally make money off of crime, why are these people allowed to? At least the criminal did something. It might be completely abhorrent and reckless, but they did that action. These people went and spoke to the criminal, and are now making money from it, at the expense of the victims. It is fundamentally wrong to take advantage of people like that to turn a buck, simple as that.

Are you going to comment on anything other than this? I have studied LCN for a long time, read a lot online, watched a lot of documentaries, from its founding to what is present. I am particularly interested in the modern mob. I don't glorify these people anywhere near as much as these self-proclaimed experts do. I simply want facts and information. I didn't see any new information brought to the table by ""Scott Burnstein"", he just seems like another profiteer. What is your opinion on his utterances?

&gt; The risk was that Bellamy's cover might be blown, but that would not add any new threat.

Even if MW people were not extremely incompetent and or arrogant (as they were portrayed so far) why would that be their first assumption? A lot of things about this season setting were shoehorned to throw in a sense of immediate danger and lack of choice for the drama. This is just one of them.

Btw, I still don't know they couldn't use more than two radio sets. Or why the grounders who suspected another sniper attack, put their scouts on the perimeter instead patrolling the woods where the sniper would be. (hence conveniently only Clarke could dispatch the sniper that was left camping for the night) 

&gt; Agency
&gt; Premeditation: Clarke had little time to think about the decision

Clarke could have sent a native fast rider, instead she choose to ride there herself. It can be argued that this decision was the last in a long line of impulsive decisions, and that after gambling everything on Bellamy she thought she had no choice but to hope for another hail marry. 

The ride was long enough for her to come up with a long list of reasons against, but ""let"" lexa convince her otherwise. IMO Clarke was impulsive and reckless but also very sharp, and in this case she knew exactly what she was doing just due to her hero complex she couldn't handle being the one to cause all those death among her people..

It was amusing that they didn't notice his absence before, after he failed to report follwoing his shift or come back home to his kid. Or later why it took them so long to reset all the clearances after a coup, especially after suspecting that someone is helping the former president..

"d2djlgd","&gt; Hmm. Perhaps. Or perhaps in an age without cars, automatic weapons, co-ed schools or the electrical grid, an 18 year old couldn't get into that much trouble. So you could still be impulsive and even reckless, but as long as you didn't break your neck jumping a hedge or get killed in a duel, you'd mostly be okay.

Disease was the real threat. Infant mortality even amongst the wealthy was staggering by modern standards. And in the pre-pharma world, a whole slew of infections were dangerous for anyone of whatever age.

&gt; College taught me to be an adult. I'm fine with people pursuing any method that accomplishes the same thing. But I think it's a mistake to just walk out of high school and assume you'll figure it out eventually.

No argument. I think the thing that people blanch at, however, is the debt burden aspect. I'm not American, but here in Australia we've gone from a time when a university education was completely free in the mid 70's to where it's now creeping closer to the US system in terms of what graduates owe by the time they get a degree. The counter argument is that the data shows higher median income for those with a tertiary education, but how the net effect of a generational change from free university education to a student loan system will all play out in the coming decades is not yet clear (the big change was in 1989 as it became obvious the free system was unsustainable). I have no doubt that a university degree will continue to be a considerable advantage, but the student debt factor can't be ignored. It's already a factor down here in home ownership rates, for instance.

&gt; (I admit, some high schools will give you about half of the above, but they are rare, and getting more so, it seems. I think one of the reasons Mary Shelley started Frankenstein at 18 is that she'd been tutored by her philosopher father, William Godwin, and was likely encouraged to think for herself from an early age.)

Definitely. 

MS had impeccable intellectual pedigree (Godwin as a father, Mary Wollstonecraft as a mother), was part of a pretty spectacular clique (Byron and the gang) and steeped in education and stimulus from an early age.

To be clear, I'm not saying an 18-year-old cannot make art. I'm saying, in 2016, an 18-year-old is a drunk bull in a really dangerous china shop. They're better off edging slowly out of the shop and into someplace where they (hopefully) will come to less harm, and might even benefit. 

And as for the difference between college and/or military and a patty fryer job: The Marine Corps systematically uses boot camp to instill initiative, teamwork, a sense of agency and problemsolving abilities in kids who show up with virtually none of the above. Colleges do much the same thing, albeit in a less organized and compressed time frame. No, it's not a perfect system. Yes, some people would do better with another route. But colleges have been producing people who go on to work and pay back their student loans with impressive success since WWII. The American military, likewise, has produced sufficiently able soldiers, Marines, sailors, pilots, etc. to keep our borders relatively secure. 

You only have to read through my comment history to find out that I didn't even know writing for TV was a thing when I was 18. Or 22. I delivered newspapers, stocked inventory in an electrical distribution warehouse, sold china in a midwestern department store and books on the Upper East Side, bussed tables, temped, worked as an administrative assistant and copy edited websites before I realized I wanted to make a living as a writer. And this is coming from an English major who wrote for and edited newspapers in high school and college and whose senior thesis was a book of poetry. I loved to write, I just didn't know how to find someone to pay me for it. 

I am grateful for each of those jobs, the rent they paid, the food they bought. But they didn't teach me to brainstorm. They didn't teach me to research. They didn't teach me to budget my time. They didn't teach me to listen to feedback on my work with respect and interest. And above all, they absolutely did not teach me that if I tackled a little bit of a project every day, in a few weeks I'd have a finished paper. In a month I'd be able to pass a midterm. In a semester I'd have passed a class. In four years, I'd have a degree. College taught me to be an adult. I'm fine with people pursuing any method that accomplishes the same thing.

"d1mtn29","The sub and dub only enthusiast are immature brats pretending that watching one version of a show over the other makes you a better fan when there's no such thing. They're so determined to make themselves seem unique to the rest of anime fans when they come off as jackasses. I mean there's nothing at all wrong with preferences, everyone has them but subs vs dubs is the dumbest argument that only waste time. Sometimes subs are better (Evangelion, Noragami) and sometimes dubs are better (Baccano, Fullmetal Alchemist.)

Now back on topic

&gt;Frankly, I would prefer, if necessary, to leave out the Japanese audio, if it meant better-cared-for dubs (foreign-dubs in the UShave historically been absent or in niche circles, which tends to sound amateurish or ""samey"" if you watch a bunch).

I'd rather they keep both. I think everyone wants the option to choose, and I don't think that leaving out the Japanese audio would impact a dub. Funimation and other dub companies have limited recourses when it comes to this, at least in terms of voice actors. The majority of them are actually only in it because they themselves are fans (like Bryce Papenbrook who plays Eren or Crispin Freeman who wants to make great dubs to bring in more anime fans in general.) That's the reason it begins to sound ""samey."" They re use multiple actors for multiple projects. The only dubs that I've seen having a  diverse cast that aren't familiar are Baccano, and basically anything done by Ghibli.

&gt;Of course, I would expect a very close match to the ""original"". (I'm a little disappointed, in retrospect, that AoT didn't attempt to match voice types - JP Levi is a tenor, Armin is a soprano, Eren is much lighter, but more forceful)

Again, I disagree with this aspect. First, there's cultural differences to get past. For example, in Japan pink is a color meaning masculinity whereas in America it's a feminine color. On top of that, they aren't voice imitator, they're voice actors seeking to bring a character to life. 

Let's describe Eren for example. A determined, angry, reckless but also smart, caring and growing teenager who's curious about the world and hateful against his enemies. There's many ways that single premise can be written and acted. Yuki Kaji has a deeper cooler sounding voice and to add depth to Eren he decided to imply fear in Eren, as if he's terrified on the inside but doing his best to stay calm. Then there's Bryce Papenbrook who instead added weakness, as if he's pissed and has to do something but isn't strong enough to. Neither are wrong and both have merits and value, along with strengths and weaknesses. They both perfectly follow the character but also add something the other doesn't have. 

Why would you want a copy of the original? This never works (look at the Psycho remake that redid everything shot for shot and somehow sucked.) A re-adaption can't be a copy since it will never live up, a artist can never copy a artist and expect to get as good as them. 

&gt;...Which brings up the validity of the animated series itself. Why are the castings by the series directors tantamount to scripture, if the origin of the story is in a different medium entirely?

I like to think that characters are the heart of every story and there can never be a good story without good characters. A good performance by a actor is necessary to make a character good in terms of medium. To series directors, I think they need a character to come across convincing and look for actors who fit the character the way they interpret.

&gt;Also, what does it mean that the ""voices fit the character""? Do these assumptions perpetuate stereotypes? Is it simply the acting that is insufficient?

I think what people mean by this is both the acting and type since you can never have one and not the other. A character who's 12 years old needs a higher pitched actor to convincingly play them. Same deal with older characters and pitches. Unless you're voicing a colored character as colored or something along those lines instead of a convincing character then I don't think it means anything towards stereotypes and is meant to say ""the voice captured the characters description and personality.""

"d19vw02","Absolutely I can relate. I am 5 months in and I feel exactly the same as you.

I supported her in ways her parents should have. She had $250K of student loans that she claimed limited her ability to pay for things so I paid for the major financials. I ended up supporting her in every way except paying her student loans. I paid all of our rent, we had one car, my car, which she drove because she couldnt afford a car, I had a company vehicle. We made comparable money but I had no debt so I ended up taking on the major financials of our relationship.

Also over the years she had a slew of weight related health problems that started to crop up. Starting with PCOS, then precancerous cells on her cervix, then thinning hair, then facial hair growth, then skin discolorations the Dr attributed to pre-diabetes, then small ovaries/premature ovarian failure (IE: early menopause), then benign lumps in her breast tissue. All of that was apparently not a big deal to her and according to her it was hopeless because she was ""trying"" to lose weight. We dated for 7 years and while she was losing weight, it was really slow, like 1 lb a week or less and she rebounded several times, in the end she was still 40-50 lbs overweight, she still is.

I know weight is a sensitive subject to discuss with a woman so I didnt discuss it. She knew she was overweight, I knew it. I let her do her thing and supported her in them: I did the juice cleanse with her, I did the vegetarian thing, I did the low carb thing. I knew that making a permanent diet change required a lifestyle change and she needed support. I supported her, I didnt keep alcohol in the house, candy or junk food or anything that was not on her approved food list even though I enjoy those things. I didnt eat food on her no-list in front of her, or drink when she wasnt drinking.

After years of support with very little weight loss results to show for it, I did become frustrated. The same with her financial recklessness. I only found out how much she paid down her loans because we applied for a bank loan to buy a commercial building to start a business. The loan paperwork had you list your debts with the starting balance and current balance, she had only paid down the principal on $250k loans by $8000. For the 7 years I supported her, she only paid them down $8000! Like I said, we made comparable money, both in the 6 figures. She was completely out of control with both her weight and financials. It made me upset and after 6.5 years I finally told her I was less attracted to her, not because she was overweight, not physically less attracted, but because of her lack of effort and her lack of concern about both her weight and financials.

That was the beginning of the end for us. She festered on my words, or so she says, for more than half a year, of course while still allowing me to pay our rent and allowing her to drive my car, until she determined that she didnt love me anymore.

I was good to her so when she broke up with me she gave me bullshit reasons, she had to delve back to 3 years ago where there was the one time I couldnt be there for her due to work obligations. I was the performance test manager on a project where we were running tests to prove to the state and client that the project met its performance guarantees, if I wasnt there the day we had a test lined up not only would I have wasted at least $500K worth of resources and manpower, the project wouldnt have received its permit from the state and the company would have had to incur monetary penalties for not meeting a contract deadline. She had surgery on that day of the test. I couldnt be there for her that time, and she brought it up as an excuse.

In addition to citing that she ""doesnt think I am there for her"" she also stated I ""made her feel bad"" (her words) that she was being financially reckless and irresponsible with her weight, and she left and moved on. Oh but she didnt try, she didnt say ""hey I feel bad about this relationship for XYZ reasons, can we work on them"" or ""im breaking up with you because of XYZ reasons"" no no, she secretly pretended everything was just peachy while she apartment hunted and looked for a car behind my back. In fact she didnt even tell me, I had to ask her if she was breaking up with me because her behavior started to show it. I wasted my time and money building a relationship with someone who was so disrespectful to me that she didnt give me the decency or respect of a chance, or a decent break up or effort.

So after her not telling me her issues, and not even telling me she was breaking up with me, and lying about wanting to continue the relationship, even going as far as saying she wanted to go on dates, which she kept blowing me off, and agreeing to attend couples counseling, which we attended one session and in that session she told the counselor she didnt want to continue the relationship, she used it as a ""check box"" to tell her friends and family that ""she had tried"". She had no intention to continue the relationship or to try at all.

Also she moved into an apartment that doesnt allow pets leaving me stuck with the two cats that she wanted and convinced me/us to get.

So of course she is still financially reckless but apparently not thinking about it and not ""feeling bad"" about it solves the problem. The same with her weight related health problems, if she doesnt feel bad about being pre-diabetic then she wont get diabetes right?

I wasted 7 years supporting an unappreciative self destructive person and not a day has gone by since we broke up that I dont despise her for being as selfish as she is and blaming me for it and convincing her family and friends. Society is always protective of a woman who claims she is a victim, white knighting men eat that up, and women ""close ranks"" and support their friends to ""make them feel better"" instead of allowing them some personal reflection and growth.

I gave her everything just like you, emotionally, intellectually, financially, my time, and just like you, she thanklessly took it for 7 years and is probably off to find another dumbass to support her self destructive behavior. I am still losing sleep 5 months later while she fell back on her friends for support, one friend even let her drive her second car for 2 months while she saved up enough to buy a $18k car. She makes $120K a year, she had to save up ~$2000 for months for a downpayment on a $18000 car? I am going to see her at a mutual friends wedding in 2 months, and I know I have to behave otherwise our other mutual friends will side with her and shun me. She is effortlessly charming so everyone likes her, I can only hope she doesnt bring the next dumbass to the wedding, it will be hard not to lose my shit.",1458694136,"in addition to citing that she ""doesnt think i am there for her"" she also stated i ""made her feel bad"" (her words) that she was being financially reckless and irresponsible with her weight, and she left and moved on.","reckless and irresponsible","reckless",NA,FALSE,"financially reckless and irresponsible","irresponsible","financially",NA,1

- A masters is not totally necessary. There are lots of opportunities out there for those of us with just a B.Sc. Not right now of course, but if you are in it for the long term, you can't be worried about what is going on right now (in O&amp;G/Mining anyways) as we all have to believe that this is just a minor blip, and things will turn around soon... right guys?.. but in the mean time I would stick it out in Environmental for now until the mining markets rebound.  
- Exploration might be the most fun you ever have at ""work"". You could find yourself trekking through the arctic, climbing a mountain pass by mule train, or hacking your way through the jungle with a machete. The downside is that, especially if you are working for a junior exploration company, any given day you can wake up and be told to go home, and suddenly have no idea what to do with yourself or when your next pay check is coming. Occasionally you might even get screwed out of some money, and rarely you might have to find your own way home. These are generally rare occurrences, but there are some greasy companies out there, and it does happen. This is all fine if you're young and reckless, but something to consider, especially if you have dependents at home. I haven't worked an actual mining job, but it seems much more stable, but (personally) not nearly as exciting.  
- You want to work in a pretty country and find gold?, totally fair. But the term ""not all that glitters is gold"" comes to mind. Geologists often end up in places where nobody else wants to go, and for good reason. Many of the gold districts are run by the underpaid/undereducated who are willing to kill for that gold. Robberies and kidnappings are not uncommon. On one of my first programs in SA, we were robbed of a sack of soil samples at gun point because the culprits thought we were walking around with sacks full of gold slung over our backs. I almost got shot over a bag of dirt...  

Now having said that, I think you should totally experience it if you get the chance! You will see amazing things, meet amazing people, make some decent money and have a damn good time doing it. I just think that anyone should have a pretty good idea of what they are in for before making the decision to get into this side of the industry. And this is just one single (slightly jaded) perspective, among many on here.

"d11wc2i","Ages ago, on a horror forum that's now gone, I'd posted about the whole John Carpenter Apocalypse trilogy and how you could possibly actually link the three of them into one story. Everything past this first sentence is stoned ramblings:


The Thing

Prince of Darkness

In The Mouth Of Madness

John Carpenter calls this his Apocalypse Trilogy, because all of the movies end with no hope for the survivors, with everyone else either dead or not human anymore, and all of them do/can present us with an end-of-humanity scenario (The Thing getting to civilisation, Satan being let loose on earth, The Old Gods coming back and killing/transforming us into their image)

But what if there was more to it than being a thematic trilogy? What if all of the movies are actually related and take place in the same world?

Let's skip forward to Prince of Darkness first. Scientists are brought together to study a living liquid, which is later revealed to be Satan, an alien that seeks to possess and corrupt humanity, that came down to earth millions of years ago and was fought and defeated by God, another alien. They were viewed by humans as spiritual creatures, because at the time they were way beyond having the cultural and technological point of reference to understand what an alien was and what lay beyond the tallest mountains..

Satan is defeated/retreats (I haven't seen it in a while, so the details may be a little off) into the jar and waits for a long time to find someone that he can control. When the jar opens, liquid sprays out, and this liquid is 'Satan', which possesses people.

Rewind back to The Thing.
It crashed down to earth hundreds, thousands, millions of years ago, for some unknown reason. It leaves the safety of it's ship and gets frozen in ice, to be uncovered by one very unlucky group of Norwegians. It kills them all, disguises itself as a dog, and runs off to the American outpost.

Now the link between the two is currently pretty flimsy, but if you think about it, you can see it.. When The Thing is assimilating the dogs, the one part that always stood out the most to me was the one short bit where it's spraying a jet of liquid at one of the dogs, which turns out to be pretty close to how Satan possesses people in Prince of Darkness - it's a living liquid that hoses people down and possesses them..
So, early on in earth's history, the God-alien chased the Satan-alien to earth to try and defeat it, which gives us Prince of Darkness.. but what if there were two ships? What if The Thing crashing into the Arctic was the result of the God-alien shooting down one of two ships, seeing it crash to earth, and figuring that The Thing died on impact while it went after the Satan-alien?

The Thing infects/copies living organisms.. So, when the Satan-liquid comes out of the jar, it infects some bugs, first.. cockroaches, specifically, which leave the church and start infecting the homeless..
As for why The Thing morphed and slaughtered and the Satan-alien didn't; The Thing's ship crashed, it landed in the Arctic, left it's ship, and froze to ""death"".. it's last thoughts were that it was going to die, and then it spends thousands of years frozen in ice..

It wakes up confused and pissed off, maybe even scared.. As soon as it assimilates a person, it knows it's out in the middle of nowhere and could very easily be trapped again, so it gets pretty gun-ho about trying to assimilate and kill people.. If you factor in the new 2011 The Thing prequel into it, The Thing seems more savage, agile and reckless in it's choices of when to change shape and try to absorb a new person, and when it's made it to the American outpost, it realizes it can't take on the same strategy, so it's a lot more cautious and stealthy..

The Satan-alien, on the other hand, is sitting in it's jar and waiting for the time it thinks is right to come out.. it's been sitting by choice, thinking and plotting and keeping it's wits about, whereas The Thing had almost died and was frozen solid and thawed out thousands of years later.. it's like a confused, wild animal; it can't think right, it can't properly control itself, and it doesn't have the information that the Satan-alien has about the rest of earth, what it's inhabitants are like, etc., it's only information is from the minds of the people it's possessing, and this alien is a lot more brutal and primal.. The Thing is the muscle, the Satan-alien is the brains, though they share the same ""race"" and physiological traits..

A quick detour: 2nd last paragraph in this section -&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Carpenter#1980s:_Continued_commercial_success ; John Carpenter is into Quantum Physics, and Prince of Darkness was influenced by theoretical physics and atomic theory ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_of_Darkness_(film)#Production ), which could also tie into Quantum Physics/Mechanics.

So, back to Prince of Darkness: Satan-alien (which I now realize I should have been calling Antichrist-alien) tries to use it's ""powers"" to summon it's dad, the big-bad, using a mirror.. But what we see as magic could easily just be quantum mechanics.. If The Thing/Satan-alien are alive on a cellular level, and can have extreme control over it's shape, where every single drop or cell is a living being.. what's to stop it from altering, on a molecular level, a mirror, and re-arranging it to be a ""teleporter""/gateway to another planet?

It succeeds. Satan is loose, walks out of the church, the movie ends, humanity is fucked. But Satan-alien is smart, unlike The Thing; it doesn't just run around and assimilate and attack everyone it sees in broad daylight.. it quietly infects people, like how no one knew they were a Thing until they changed.. It covers it's tracks.. it slowly infects people and amasses it's army of Things..

And then, it assimilates a writer. His name is Sutter Cane.

Which brings us to In The Mouth of Madness; possibly the most Lovecraftian movie ever made. In this movie, Sutter Cane writes about his dreams and fantastical ideas, of these monsters and creatures taking over the earth.. but his early books, like The Hobbs End Horror, are a more one-on-one, monster-killing-a-few-people type of story..

Another side-track; Dark Horse made a series of The Thing comics, under the name The Thing From Another World. These are pretty much totally non-cannon to the movie universe, but there's one 4-part mini called Eternal Vows.

In Eternal Vows, The Thing has gotten control of itself; it's no longer as violent and savage, and it doesn't want to infect people any more, though it still needs to kill.. It's explained that The Thing is always dying, and it needs fresh cells to replace the ones that die, and that if it ""takes"" cells, but doesn't ""leave"" it's bad/dead cells, the person killed won't become a Thing..

The relevant part, though, is that The Thing is posing as a woman (mostly), and the woman constantly has trouble sleeping and gets nightmares from the memories of the people who's cells she absorbed to keep from dying.. She doesn't realize she's a Thing at first, and keeps having these nightmares that she's being attacked by monsters in different parts of town, which is really the memories she's absorbed of the people she's killed..

Back to In The Mouth of Madness; Sutter Cane gets infected by a Thing, but doesn't realize it. He suddenly has these visions and nightmares about people in a forgotten town getting attacked and killed by weird, shape-changing monsters, elder gods from before mankind that have been asleep for centuries/millennia...

Is this starting to sound familiar yet?

So he writes about them, and the books sell, and the Satan-alien sees that the books are selling like hotcakes, so with a few key possessions/assimilations, it owns the printing house/publisher, and into the ink goes The Thing liquid.. Anyone who picks up a book now has touched the living liquid of the Satan-alien and is now on their way to becoming a Thing, though they don't know it yet.. They hallucinate and see the stories, because now it's not just something they read, but a memory of an actual event that's been passed on like a genetic memory..

In The Thing, Blair works out that by 27,000 hours after The Thing comes into contact with civilization, the entire population of earth would be assimilated; that's a bit over three years.. In The Mouth of Madness starts in 1995, and Sutter Cane has been writing books for a while now.. But he's not infected with ""The Thing"", which is more brutal and reckless, but by the ""Satan-alien"", which is a slow, methodical planner.. it's been slowly infecting people, and finally with this last book, it's worked up enough of an army to pull off a full-on assault on humanity..

So, In The Mouth of Madness looks like it's happening during the summer time, and as things are starting to ""go to shit"", so to say, Sam Neil's character has been locked up in an asylum for at least 6 months, meaning the end of the movie would happen right around the new year, 1996. People all over the world now are changing into monsters, but there's still radio, electricity, etc., so civilization hasn't COMPLETELY ground to a stop, but it's definitely a world-wide apocalyptic-level epidemic..

Roughly three years later, in 1999, Brian finally manages to work with Tachyons to send the dream back to 1987, trying to warn the people in the church about Cathrine's eventual assimilation by the Satan-alien and to try and prevent the future from happening...

"d10ktpc","My experience (working in a hospital) is that almost everyone I know is pro-choice on both accounts. In many cases, I think that the people who refuse vaccines are stupid and reckless, but it is nonetheless their choice.

Having said that, vaccines are an overwhelmingly medically/epidemiologically proven benefit to mankind as a whole with only one study funded by anti-vac (none-medical) groups and lead by a corrupt doctor preying on the uneducated's fears claiming otherwise without any scientific basis in truth. Abortion, on the other hand, is a complex and multi-factorial problem with numerous perspectives and dimensions in which it must be examined, no matter which side of the fence you fall on. To compare the two is disingenuous.

To put this in context, I think it is also perfectly okay to say ""I am pro-choice for abortion, but anti-choice for forced public education for minors through age 16."" I am not saying that I believe that, nor am I saying that the majority of people I know say that about education or vaccines.

&gt;'He did hurt me, but my left eye was already gone. He was not responsible for that.'

&gt;In an exclusive interview with Mail Online Trinh said he is happy for Wahlberg to be given a pardon saying: 'He was young and reckless but I forgive him now. Everyone deserves another chance.

&gt;'I would like to see him get a pardon. He should not have the crime hanging over him any longer.'

&gt;Trinh added that he would like to meet Wahlberg face to face to tell him he does not bear a grudge.

&gt;'He paid for his crime when he went to prison. I am not saying that it did not hurt when he punched me in the face, but it was a long time ago.

"d0z9139","I really struggle to see how intent is irrelevant (I'm not saying it should be critical, just not irrelevant). In this particular scenario it could be argued that Tomas is attempting to bind to the ruck as he hits it. From what I can tell he can't see Dan Cole's face as he hits the ruck. The slow motion probably makes it look much worse too, in real time that would have occurred in the blink of an eye (no pun intended). The sensation of hitting a ruck at that pace and power would mean he probably had no idea what exactly he was binding on to, maybe he felt something squidgy and removed his hand as soon as he could. I'm not saying this is what happened, but to me it seems probable. I thought reversed penalty and a short ban for recklessness is fair, but I don't think making an example of him is. 

If intent is irrelevant then more of the game is dictated by luck. Maybe Tomas had no intent but gets a hefty ban that means he can't tour NZ? That would be mightily unlucky. In the extreme cases of removing intent from the equation may encourage players to put themselves in danger to get opposition players banned

Alternatively, intent is very relevant and players just get good at disguising their intent to look innocent. This would be a terrible precedent to set as well. I think a middle ground could be found between the two judiciaries, but where intent has a small relevancy, just not too much and not none at all. Player history could help here too. 

I dunno, I would say this as a Welshman, I get that, but I'd be saying the same thing if I were a neutral to the event (and I don't think we were robbed, you'd have to be clinically insane to think that).

"d0mqo20","Blake &gt; Ruby &gt; Weiss &gt; Yang. I have a rather...controversial...opinion on Yang, but I'll save that for later.

**Blake** - The one I relate to and sympathize with the most. While I was initially disinterested in her, once I came to learn more about her, I grew to love her. All her life, she's fought against racism and oppression, but still has morality and left the White Fang because they went too far in her eyes. One of her motives for becoming a Huntress in the first place is because she wants to atone for her past and continue to work against corruption and oppression. I find this more relatable than Ruby's motive (protecting people from monsters and being the hero) because the criminals and racist businesses Blake wishes to stop have actually been a problem in real life. Sure, she's made her fair share of mistakes, but her heart is *definitely* in the right place. Plus her fighting style is also my favorite.

**Ruby** - Not only is almost every scene with her adorable, but like Blake, she became a huntress because she cares about Remnant and its people, and wants to protect them from Grimm at all costs. Yes, she can be naive and reckless, but she's still young, and I can see her trying very hard to better herself in the future.

**Weiss** - My opinion on Weiss is kind of weird. I while I don't necessarily dislike her, she's definitely not one of my favorites. Still, I respect her trying to be nicer to her friends and more understanding to Faunas. It's just that her character and background (lonely rich girl with controlling father who she feels the need to rebel against) is the least interesting to me. That being said, I still like her more than...

**Yang** - *Oh boy*. I don't think there's a single character in the entire series who I've come to dislike more than Yang (at least until more was revealed about the villains, but even then it was intentional). Yang embodies some of the personality traits that I hate the most. Short temper, excessive use of force, arrogance, and complete refusal to take responsibility for the three so far. Not to mention, she isn't a huntress because she wants to make the world a better place like Blake or her own sister, Ruby. No, instead she became a huntress to have an excuse to beat people up. Something utterly selfish in my eyes. Yes, she's had a difficult past that might explain some of these traits, but when Blake has most likely been through far worse than Yang *ever* did and still came out a much more moral person, it makes it incredibly difficult for me to sympathize with Yang. All this makes me think that, at least at the moment, Yang seriously isn't fit to be a huntress. I at least sympathize with her predicament right now, but if she doesn't learn to confront herself and all the negative qualities I've listed, it will make me think her maiming by Adam was honestly a *good* thing.

Go ahead and downvote me all you want, but Yang fans who can't handle someone else expressing their dislike towards their favorite character just makes me hate her even more.

If the word sounds harsh, you may be right, but that's what it is. Turning back time is cheating. Reloading a save or restarting at a specific chapter is cheating. But hey...that's the game. You're supposed to do it.

Now yeah, we all get the lesson about maturity and how that no matter how good you are at cheating, the universe can just cheat better. Cheaters never prosper. But then again, that doesn't mean you still can't cheat.

Now, I can still go cheat to go do it again and see that scene. I won't, but I can.

I thought about it. I even cheated and opened another save file to let me see the ending to both of them. But I then deleted the save of ""Sacrifice Arcadia Bay""...that ending wasn't acceptable to me.

So, yeah, I watched ""Sacrifice Chloe"" again. Yeah, I cried. It wasn't the scene in the bathroom, it was the blue butterfly that lands on Chloe's coffin.

I even needed a moment after typing that.

It was my decision, I made it, and if faced with it again I'll make it again. In fact, it probably wasn't the hardest decision in the game for me...I really struggled with deciding whether or not to tell David that Jefferson murdered Chloe after he rescued me. I must have spent half an hour there in that scene thinking about it.

But, win lose or draw, it was my call and I made it. Even worse, I didn't just kill Chloe. I *annihilated her*. I erased her out of existence. From the bathroom to the storm, that Chloe isn't even gone...you have to be somewhere first before you can then be gone. The blame's on me. The universe didn't say so, *I said so*.

It still hasn't been 24 hours and I still feel like shit. It's even worse than that. Even if you choose to doom the town, you can still save some people. Except...I didn't. The homeless person outside the diner you can tell her to skip town...I never even noticed until I saw her body in episode 5. Even worse, I'd helped Alyssa out in every episode so far...and blew right by her in Episode 5. Dammit, I'm a writer....I fucking knew she was going to need my help again and I completely forgot. God dammit I was mad at myself when I saw that in the percentages screen at the end. And dammit, I was nice to Victoria, even when she didn't deserve it, and she believed me when I warned her. And, all it did was get her killed.

But I can't keep beating myself up. I've had my battles with depression, and I know how hard it seems to see the good sides to things when it's on you. So, I've made a habit of it.

I saved Kate on the first try, without reloading the game. Good on me for pulling those few clues in her room earlier. I got the book code from Frank without anyone getting hurt. And, with the sky falling in episode 5 and me knowing full well that *nothing in the universe could possibly matter* as much as me getting to Warren and the picture...I still found time to save Evan and the fisherman. I'm not so jaded after all.

Even then though, I thought my showing as a Time Lord wasn't so hot. For fuck's sake, couldn't I at least have stopped Daniel from getting bullied?

But, then again, what did we say at the beginning? You're supposed to cheat. That's the point of the game.

Perhaps you've heard of the saying that you're not really dead until the last person who remembers you dies. That's when you truly cease to be. 

I chose have Max to annihilate Chloe...but I didn't succeed. Max will remember her that week, and even the other Chloe you meet at the end of episode 3. She's not dead.

Now, she will die when Max does. At least, that's only if Max never tells anyone. And, she probably won't. 

But fuck that, I'm going to cheat.

Max is an artist. What's to stop her from picking up a pen and writing the story down? She's not forgetting it any time soon, and she'll have no problems presenting it to be as compelling as it was to you or me. In fact, she may have missed her trip to San Francisco, but there's no doubt in my mind that she'll be able to make it eventually. So, I see her graduating, and coming back in a year or so to Arcadia Bay, and presenting to a distraught Joyce and David a first edition of the book, photo essay, or whatever. 

Yeah, headcanon may be lame. It's cheating to make up what you want to believe. 

But do it anyway. Remember, cheating is the point of this game.

Shit...it's actually pretty funny. Chloe was annoying the shit out of me early on. When playing with the gun I was rolling my eyes at how obvious it was that she would hurt herself...and yes, I called the car bumper before finishing the scene. She pissed me off so often at how she kept being childish, impulsive, and reckless. But hey, the story went on and when it came time to propose the final question...she came through. She stopped thinking about herself and the fun she could have, and instead implored me to do the right thing. 

Dammit, I was proud of her.

So, that's what I choose to remember. That's how I'm going to cheat so I can be happy about a sad story. But even then, I may have annihilated Chloe...but she still exists. After all, she made me do something.

I had an old writing friend that I hadn't spoken to in months. We were going to write a book together and started on it, until life happened. I messaged her last night and got a response...we'll be getting back to work on the project soon. It's because this game made me think of her...and I'm gonna send her a copy. She'll cry her eyes out, but hey, she'll be glad she played it. She's an artist too.

I might want to buy stock in Kleenex first though...

So yeah, I couldn't cheat in the game to do everything I wanted and make the game end the way I wanted it to end. But even then, I can still cheat.

Some people say cheaters never prosper, but I feel good enough about it. So, don't feel bad about it. After all, this game's about cheating.

"czogj0o","&gt; Why 60...

It's a nice, round number that sits within the accepted sentencing guidelines for misdemeanor offenses.

Like it or not, sentencing guidelines are a thing. We, as a society, place an upper and lower limit to punishment based on the severity of an offense because we acknowledge that as much as someone who shoplifts a candy bar shouldn't get life without parole, a serial killer shouldn't get let off with community service and a fine. Unfortunately, that means that you have to draw lines somewhere and not everybody is going to like them.

If you don't like some of those lines, I recommend you start a petition and write your congressman. 

In the case of these protesters, what they did was reckless. People could have died. This wasn't a victimless crime -- the rights of real people to go about their way was impeded. A man was delayed from getting to the hospital because of it. The minimum sentence, then, isn't appropriate. At the same time, their intent was more likely to cause a disruption than to hurt somebody. It was inconsiderate and reckless, but not malicious. The maximum sentence isn't appropriate either. Sixty days/thirty days with good time falls somewhere in the middle. It's a compromise between two extremes that leans toward the lesser end.

&gt; ... and not 1 day...

Because a one day sentence is a joke, not a serious deterrent. It's the kind of thing you do to scare a child straight for petty shoplifting.

&gt;... or 10,000 days?

Because a 27 year sentence would clearly be excessive here. What the protesters did was reckless and potentially dangerous, but not premeditated murder or armed robbery.

Usually a number is included at the end to give more details. E.g. Kiloplex 4 means a station with a capacity of 4 thousand.*

Director General of the Triumphant Cluster, and Chief Director of the Triumphant Megaplex 1. 

Born in the 78th Apsis Cycle (AC) to  Jared Trionfi the Director General of the Triumphant Triad, a collection of 2 Kiloplexes (1 and 3) and a Decoplex 5. His mother was Donna Queen, High Chancellor of one of Kiloplex 3. 

Given the high and clear orbit,  the Triad made Jared Trionfi very wealthy.  By the time of his death he had turned over the Triumphant legacy to his son Craig, whom lost yhe controlling position 5 times.

Craig Trionfi was a reckless but charismatic leader, often pushing his people and allies over the edge only to ralley with new friends and allies. 

His influence is born of an iron clad merchant's deal forged by his father with the Olympus Mons Traders Association.  Only his inherited authority allows for cheap landing rights on the largest spaceport on Mars.

He has exploited this loophole around the notoriously high Martian tariffs to gain wealthy allies. When he burns one bridge with his behaviour he simply moves onto the next trade mogul. 

Over the years he has grown the Triumphant Triad to a Megaplex 1, 5 Kiloplexes , 6 Hectoplexes, and 10 Kiloplexes and 20 Decoplexes.  Not the largest cluster, but enough (in combination with Craig's bombastic approach to PR) to make him well known throughout the Bits (Plexes in various orbits). 

Recently he's made a move to influence Martian politics.

The state is perfectly justified in deterring reckless, risky behavior that harms the public both individually and collectively, and one rational means by which to do that is to drop the hammer on people who do it. The National Park Service estimates that 90% of wildland fires are caused by humans; think about the 2014 wildfires in California: They injured at least 146 people, and killed two, including one firefighter. They destroyed hundreds of homes, displaced thousands of people, and caused at least $184 million in private property damage, to say nothing of the cost to the state (i.e. to the public collectively) of fighting the fires.

To me, they seem to be saying, we want to do a better job of a convincing blossoming bad guy because we think we can do a better job and give fans the satisfaction they didn't get watching Anakin turn into Vader. 

It depends how good he is in the next film. I think if you know he's meant to be similar to vader in how he is attracted to the dark side but struggles with it, and that we're seeing him earlier in his training than Vader in the first film, he's quite menacing; more unpredictably violent, seemingly more powerful, but not even fully trained yet.

"cyho1u2","Glad ya actually read into it. Valid that playing on bad teams inflates stats through minutes, but getting stats while on a bad team (especially for guards who often rely on assist numbers) is still impressive and what i'm going on isn't the stats necessarily but is predominantly the game-tape (just using stats for backup). 

Devin was a beast, OD quick (literally fastest in the league at that point) and going to work. Raymond (who I watched a ton of because of my J-Rich allegiance) was also playing super well, if you're one of the only offensive options on a horrible team obviously defensive pressure will be more focused on you and your shooting %s will be down. Charlie V at that point was a good rebounding big with tremendous offensive range. Mavs definitely belong in top 10 but the argument is easily made for why a couple other teams might be better than them, so you have a fair point.

"cy7ku36","So you've got a couple of clear issues here, but I think the real core is the question of what do you want traps to do.  Traditionally traps provide either a resource depletion (i.e. HP, equipment and spells) opportunity or a puzzle.  

Resource depletion traps are your 10' pits, dart shooters etc.  They penalize incautious PCs who are trying to move too fast and reckless - but really it's sorta sad when they kill a character on their own.  These traps don't really need to be telegraphed though they can be, and should if a player actually asks. 

For example: A pit trap in the cave entrance does 1D6 points of damage, and is hidden by leaves, a character 10' poling the ground will spot it, and one who says ""I'm looking at the floor a lot"" might spot it - tell them there's leaves all over the cave floor, a thick lair that looks like it makes crunchy noises - see what happens.   

Puzzle traps are the more serious sort of traps, and can/should be a serious risk - absolutely lethal even. They should also be well telegraphed and damn tempting.

One I like is a pair of 15' tall iron statues with gold masks.  Climb up remove the mask and reveal a skull with glowing red eyes that shoots death rays.  Now it's a question of how fast the party can tip over a giant statue or think to cover the head with a shield or sack. Otherwise it's an 8 HD  attack per round that does a flat 60% of HP or something. Players should know stealing gold masks from giant statues is a bad idea.

Now on the specifics:

A) Your first concern is about not committing to the trap.  If the player says ""I walk across the room"" like that they clearly aren't paying attention - they trigger the trap.  No need to check exactly where it was - the player isn't saying where they are either - you can interpret their lack of specific information however you want.  Sometimes traps kill characters - unless you added the trap later because you felt like there weren't enough dead heroes it's fine.

B) Overly cautious parties need to pay for that caution in some currency - usually time.  Though time only means something with random encounters. Generally I'd say 10 minutes (1 turn in the parlance of my edition) per zany trap detection method. Roll a die openly, let the players know that it's to see if anything happens, make random encounter tables - they are there for a reason.  A no XP, resource wasting conflict with dungeon mooks is the plenty for checking every door seven times. Likewise resource depletion - spell exhaustion, torches running out that sort of thing. If your edition is complex combat focused - roll to see if nearby monsters (that is save yourself the trouble of setting up one of those complex encounters) show up and get the drop on the party while they are pouring water on the floor.

"cy3tvp8","&gt;A subprime mortgage refers to any mortgage that is offered by a lender that is considered riskier than the majority of loans. There is a market for prime mortgages and then there is a separate market for subprime. The majority of subprime loans are made to those who have low credit scores. When you cannot qualify for a regular mortgage because of your credit score, subprime mortgages are often available as an alternative. Although there is no definitive parameter of where a subprime loan starts, typically if you have a credit score of less than 640, these are the loans that will be available to you. Subprime mortgages can be offered in a variety of situations. 

The housing bubble came about because the government tried to incentivize banks to lend to people who otherwise couldn't afford a home, because it was considered inequality that poor people couldn't get loans or mortgages like those in the middle and upper middle classes.

Here's a short article about Obama's stance: 

&gt;President Barack Obama said Thursday the mortgage finance practices that led to the economic meltdown were ""immoral, inappropriate and reckless,"" but not necessarily illegal, making it difficult to punish key players, specifically in the subprime debacle. Obama made those statements after a reporter asked the president during a news conference why the administration never filed any lawsuits or enforcement actions against corporate leaders who led lending institutions prior to the 2008 crash. ""If someone has engaged in fraudulent actions — if they have violated laws on the books, they need to be prosecuted,"" President Obama said. ""One of the biggest problems about the collapse of Lehman, the financial crisis and the subprime lending fiasco is that all of that stuff wasn't necessarily illegal."" The president used that question as a gateway to discuss the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and the agency's role in fleshing out and enforcing rules that will affect mortgage, auto and other consumer lending practices. The president said the ""idea is to have a consumer watchdog in place letting consumers know what fair practices are and make sure banks have to compete for customers on the quality of their services and good prices.""

"cxte0i4","My (now) husband and I uprooted and moved to Seattle from Texas when we were 19. It was stupid and reckless but just a ton of fun for a couple of idiot kids. It also forced us to grow up incredibly fast and definitely taught me how to properly adult on my finances. 7 years later I'm sitting here with a house and three kids and my husband and I are finishing up our degrees while living a pretty great middle-class life and I would never, ever recommend such a drastic move to anyone. But I also know the value of being reckless while you're young and don't have anything to lose. So I'll tell you what I learned from my experience, so long as you understand how incredibly stupid such a move actually is. 

Seattle is an absolutely amazing city, if you can deal with the lack of sunlight (seriously, stock up on vitamin D supplements or you'll literally go crazy). It's beautiful and has a lot to do and a lot of opportunities. It's got a pretty high cost of living, but in my experience if you're willing to work menial jobs and be pretty frugal and lenient with where you live it's definitely doable. Here's what we did (with some lessons learned from our mistakes!):

-We set off by packing as much into my little Pontiac Sunfire as we could and selling the rest. We had about $2,000 to start. We drove straight through, taking turns driving and sleeping at rest stops. No hotels. Once we got to Seattle we found a cheap motel with weekly rates and a kitchenette. The kitchenette is important, you can't afford to eat fast food during this time. 

-This is the hard part that will make or break this life-changing gamble. Find a job. ASAP. Set up interviews and call around and if possible get a job before you ever go. You need a job to get an apartment, and you won't last long paying weekly rates at motels. Being homeless is no fun, trust me. We ended up living in my car and showering at a state park. Take whatever job someone will give you. For me, it was with Grassroots Campaigns, being one of those annoying people that go door to door asking you to donate money to a cause. I hated it, but it was minimum wage and nearly impossible to get fired from for at least a month. But all you need is a statement of income from your job to get an apartment. 

-Find a cheap apartment complex that is doing a promotion for the deposit. We found a place doing a $99 deposit promo. It was a tiny studio in a less than great part of town. But it was within walking distance to a shopping center and grocery store and it's not like we had anything worth stealing. We slept on a piece of foam for a year and used a single cast iron skillet and a $20 rice cooker for pretty much every meal.

-Sell your car and pay monthly for a PugetPass. Public transportation can get you just about anywhere in the Seattle area. A car isn't necessary.  

-I didn't last long at the campaign place, but like I said, it got us into an apartment. I then got a job waiting tables, which in the right place can make you pretty damn good money. At a good enough place you can make 15-20% tips on top of full minimum wage in Washington. That's nothing to scoff at. That job settled us in, and within a year we were able to upgrade our apartment to a better neighborhood and had money for our ""play"" fund. 

I repeat, THIS IS STUPID AND I DO NOT ENDORSE IT. But that's how it worked out for us. If you have any questions about details of our little adventure, ask away. I also became the queen of budgeting during this time if you have any questions about living on nothing in that area (there's surprisingly a lot to do in Seattle with very little money!)",1449700539,"it was stupid and reckless but just a ton of fun for a couple of idiot kids.","stupid and reckless","reckless",NA,FALSE,"stupid and reckless","stupid",NA,NA,0

"cxk92p8","Began to play MH with MHF on PSP. 

Played MHX for multiple hours already. 
5* village, HR4, mostly soloing the content ( god the osutogaroa solo was annoying and boring ).

* Hunter arts feel extremely good, you get rewarded for playing agressive / using your hunting style. Some are also really hard to use efficiently despite providing insane damages, that's basically a two edged sword, faithful to the MH series. High risk, High reward, you have to deeply think about the patterns of the monsters. That's why it ends up giving a ""normal"" MH feel but with a higher pace, it adds some planning but also forces you to act.

* Hunting styles. I personally only tried Bushido and Aerial. Let's face it, they're really strong for those who master them, but they also clearly have their weaknesses. Aerial ultimately stops you from moving on the x-axis and most monsters are big enough to not care about your position on the y-axis, as such your are extremely vulnerable during the action. Bushido, it basically is better than a free evade+3 BUT it also FORCES you to sprint during 1 to 2 seconds in a single direction (decided as soon as you finish the evade) then to stop during 1 to 2 seconds in order to hit, you're also extremely vulnerable during the use of the attack, and it forces you to use the skill despite that because otherwise it greatly reduces your overall DPS/utility ( by removing you a combo / finisher ), in the end it promotes absurdly agressive and risky playstyle that is original and kinda addictive. For now I mostly used IG and Longswords ( my 2 favorite weapons ), but I have yet to try the other weapons in order to see how it fits.

* Regarding the weapon &amp; gears upgrade system, I didn't use it much yet knowing I basically finished the whole village and online low rank with an arzuros LR armor + the rathian longsword ( first level ). But from what I've seen, it seems kinda weird, all these levels etc.. I will have to farm HR a little in order to really use it. One thing I noted though is that the IG upgrade system seems A LOT better.

* Regarding the village(s), erh, I will be honest, it sucks. Your ""farm"" went back to something disappointing, you can visit the old villages but you can't use their farm ( Why can't I f****** go in MHF2 village, climb the ladder and mine at the top or and send a felyne with a big explosive into a deep and dark tunnel) , I'm basically sitting on my points while duplicating everything I can... Story-wise, it ain't better either, MH4 and MH4G stories were actually really good and interesting, I hoped that they would do the same or at least try with this one, but they didn't. The palico system in the other hand seems more interesting even if ultimately you have less activities to do with them.

To conclude, I would say that gameplay-wise, this MH is on point. It forces you to play agressive, to be useful and kinda reckless but you will have to be a lot more precise and on point with your mechanics, that's a good thing for this series, the ""flashy"" effects in the end are just icing on the cake, they decided to design it this way, that's fine.

Even as she marches off to her death, she openly regrets her actions for the first time in her life, showing that her bubbly attitude was a facade, mentions how she wished she could have fallen in love, how there was so much left to enjoy in life and she'll miss it, but that it's worth it to keep the PC safe.

Personal fouls don't make a player dirty, but a history of them is enough to raise suspicion.  The rule that got him a flag and fine has been around since before Miller was in the league.  On it's own it's not necessarily a dirty play (though 100% illegal and reckless), but how about when you line it up with his other 8 personal fouls?

What's funny is that I think last year's penalty was more defensible than this year's.

Reckless doesn't necessarily mean what you think it means, at least as far as laws are concerned. 

Case 1 - vehicle drifted left of center - not reckless. 

case 2  - guy driving a box truck accidentally rear ends someone - not reckless

Case 3 - woman was texting drifted left of center - maybe reckless, but good luck proving it 

Case 4 - drifted left of center and caused head on collision. No proof of it being reckless. 


To behave recklessly, you have to ""grossly"" deviate from the standard of care, and knowingly engaging in conduct that puts others in danger despite the risk. That is, you *KNEW* what you were doing was dangerous, (or anyone would have known) and you kept doing it anyway. 

Driving while drunk is reckless. 

Speeding way over the limit (like 25 or 30mph over) or racing, is reckless, or can be depending on the circumstances.  (65 in a neighborhood is very different from 65 on a rural road, even if the speed limit is 30 in both places). 

Texting *might* be reckless, but I'm not sure we're there just yet. There's a lot of sub-cases.   Are you going to convince 9/9 people in a jury that some teenager should go to jail for 15 years because their phone buzzed and they looked at it while they were driving?

"cvbo6jz","ACID:

(Jan 17 2008)

A few days ago, I bought 5 hits of acid. I was planning to invite someone round, but they couldn't make it before the weekend and I was very eager to do it anyway. I also wasn't sure if they were dud tabs, and wanted to check.

Yesterday, when I had finished all my scheduled appointments, I went back to my room and took two hits of acid, and watched Christmas in Canada. When I started tripping, I texted two of my friends and told them to come round and join me. They didn't. I didn't care; I'm fucking badass irresponsible and I'll take acid for the first time by myself. There were other people I could have invited round, or friends who I could have got in touch with, but by this point I was already too fucked. Over the course of the evening, half the time I was really pleased to be alone and the rest of the time I wanted to go and bug someone sober (but I thought they might think I was mad, running up to them saying ""I've just taken lsd for the first time, let's talk,"" so I didn't go knocking on doors).

I had been listening to songs tagged 'post rock' on last fm and it was all amazing. In fact, Aphex Twin, William Shatner, Sigur Ros, Camel, the Beatles' Sergeant Peppers, and pretty much every other happy band I listened to were absolutely amazing. 'Day in the Life' was particularly amazing.

I was hallucinating that I was just a little leaf being blown in the wind, or that my bedroom was opening out into the heavens. The ego-death was phenomenal, and the sense of a grand communion was also phenomenal. Half the time I was an insignificant part of the universe, of infinity, and the rest of the time it was like I had the universe backing me up and telling me I was amazing, like the line between infinity and my consciousness was completely shattered.

I was also occasionally very horny, and it's pretty good that I 
hadn't invited anyone round because if they were female I'd be sexually harassing them, and if they were male they'd be blowing my buzz and confusing my sense of control. Listening to psychedelic music and hugging my duvet made me exceptionally horny, and I really understood the 'free love' philosophy; the best bits were just like having an amazing orgasm with a woman you love, and it would be amazing to do acid with a (sane, trip-friendly) girlfriend and cuddle her and bang her all night.

I got a phone call from my dad half-way through which kinda scared the shit out of me, but I told him I was busy and was just about to go out with my friends. And I think I got away with it.
I then went to the kitchen and hung around for a bit. One of my flatmates came in and asked for a hug, which was amazing because I'd been craving to hug a girl for ages. I told her I had dropped acid this evening by myself, hoping to engage her in conversation and unleash my epiphany on her. She wasn't particularly impressed. Then a mate of mine came in and I told him that I had dropped acid this evening, and he was far more interested. I told him how I felt like a minuscule part of the cosmos and it felt like we were all united by love, and that I'd been listening to music and it was amazing, and it had been one of the most positive and amazing experiences of my life, and he listened and responded and seemed interested. I was exceptionally grateful to him for listening to me chatting bollocks, and he seemed more than pleased to oblige.

I then returned to my room. and watched Southpark, because I kinda thought I was coming down. I felt really compelled to watch Tweak vs Craig, because of the Mr Adler character. After finishing the episode, I realised I was still tripping, and started listening to more post-rock. Eventually, it appears I fell asleep.

Throughout the whole time I felt part of this great infinity, and it was like the most spiritual moments on mushrooms, for like 12 hours solid. I've always thought drugs like these are what reaching enlightenment is all about, and it really did feel like I was in the midst of the most phenomenal meditative session ever, with a massive urge to engage in tantric sex. You feel totally as positive and as good and as spiritually fulfilled as you're ever going to. You also seem to do a bit of soul-searching, asking yourself questions about your personality, and coming up with answers that seem totally satisfactory. It really feels like I've completely cleansed my mind, like I've been reborn, I understand a more innate self far more, and I wouldn't advise doing it often, but I do think that everyone old enough should do acid, and the world might be better if politicians give it a shot, too. There's no way to fully understand the 60s philosophy without doing acid. Acid has changed the world, and you'll recognise it if you do it. But be careful and don't do it often, or do too much.

I wrote a poem about the experience when I was still tripping. I wrote a lot of things down. I wanted to take something solid out of it. It all seems to make some degree of sense, but I was careful to make sure it did. I was really pleased with this poem when I wrote it, perhaps because I was tripping my balls off.

Next time, with company. Hopefully female. And seperate rooms, for personal time.

Thought on Taking Acid

This bedroom

has housed infinity.

The full contents of

an inside out mind

can be found

splattered on its walls.


This evening

has been infinite.

Tumbling over the horizon,

Yet you are suggesting to abolish vernacular schools now. By the way, you need to recheck the definition of vernacular schools. Your religious schools are not part of the vernacular school system, not to mention they are FULLY funded.


&gt; It can happen in our life time if people stop fighting only for their own race 


You do know that vernaculars are not just for their respective race, right?

"cv5x78p","I reacted to your comment because, while a rhetorical question, it assumes A) I don't know the rules and B) assuming A was true, I also decided to comment on something without any knowledge of it. When taken in that context, I'm sure you can see the impression your question leaves. 

That's neither here nor there though, as you've pointed out we're going in circles. The criteria you listed are accurate, but I'd point to one portion of FIFA's latest LOTG as a section that can cast reasonable doubt in this case:

“Reckless” means that the player has acted with complete disregard to the danger to, or consequences for, his opponent.
• A player who plays in a reckless manner must be cautioned

“Using excessive force” means that the player has far exceeded the necessary use of force and is in danger of injuring his opponent.
• A player who uses excessive force must be sent off

^source: FIFA's website

FIFA draws a distinction between careless, reckless, and excessive. I think we can rule out careless; Moreno's tackle definitely ventures into at least reckless territory. But the line between reckless and excessive is fuzzy.

Moreno lunges, but at the point of contact with Shaw (best I can tell from slowing down replays), his body is on the ground. So it's more of a gray area than say, if he was still airborne at the point of contact. He comes in from the front, which is usually viewed as less heinous (even though as you correctly pointed out, tackles from the front can still be deemed excessive). Finally, probably the killer here because officials fall into this trap all the time, he took the ball first. This tends to soften an official's view of a challenge. 

IMO, Moreno should've been cautioned, because his challenge was reckless. But I don't think Poll is correct in saying that he HAD to be dismissed. And I think Poll's bias is what tips him over the edge of viewing it as excessive vs reckless.

"cupb9jw","Well, Mary had set up a decent fortress for herself, but it appeared he and Theo were on their own. Hardly surprising, yet he couldn't help wishing she was a bit more team-oriented. With a sigh, he glanced back down at his pocketknife. Now having the luxury to stop and notice just how disgusting it really was, he decided he wanted to give the thing a proper cleaning before anything else. So, with a quickly muttered, ""I'll be right back,"" he exited the theatre and headed towards the bathroom.

Surprisingly, the bathroom wasn't in awful condition. Men's rooms were, in the best of circumstances, usually not pinnacles of sanitation, and he had expected a zombie apocalypse would only worsen the state of affairs. But it appeared this was not the case. Grateful for the surprise, he approached the far sink, he began slowly wiping the grime and bodily fluids off the blade. Normally he wouldn't have cared too much, but the little knife held sentimental value for him. It hardly even registered as a weapon sometimes, which would explain why it hadn't occurred to him he shouldn't pack it on his flight to New York. Oh well, no harm done. The TSA hadn't found it, and it was certainly serving him well now.

The memories of his trip here a few short weeks ago began dragging other memories up with it, memories of home he wasn't quite ready to deal with. From an early age, he'd always been a bit of a loner. His parents were never too concerned about it though, as their attention was captured by his older sister most of the time. She was, in many ways, the ideal daughter. Outgoing, friendly, prom queen in high school and president of her sorority in college. Of course, she was wild and reckless, but such things were paid little attention their parents. Not because they didn't know, but because they chose not to know.

Klaus had been fourteen when she died. After a night of partying, she'd decided, against all common sense, to drive back to the sorority house on her own, inebriation be damned. She'd made it half way home before slamming into the back of an eighteen wheeler. While he was of course saddened by the turn of events, he was hardly surprised. Such an end for her had always been a forgone conclusion. His parents, on the other hand, were completely blindsided. After years of denying her wilder side, they'd convinced themselves she truly was a perfect child. Her dying from her own drunken mistakes was unthinkable for them.

In the wake of her death, they began to cope by showering him with attention, attention he neither needed nor wanted. It wasn't that Klaus completely eschewed social relationships, but he desired time to himself to think, and the sudden interest in his every action was beginning to feel smothering. He'd been annoyed at the time, yet now he found himself missing that attention from them. Were they worrying about him, he wondered? Or had they written him off as dead. Heck, were *they* still alive? He had no way of knowing how far the infection had spread by now, but he imagined it was no longer contained to the northeast. Perhaps the west coast had had time to evacuate to Asia. Or perhaps any traveling from the Americas was closed in hopes of keeping the infection contained. Who knew?

The knife now cleaned, he returned to the threatre, noticing Theo had already fallen asleep. He could hardly blame him. Working as silently as possibly, he cut away strips of the curtain, laying enough down on the floor to form a half-decent mattress before cutting himself a blanket. Not perfect, but it would suffice. He was still admiring his creation when Mary's voice caught him off guard, causing him to spin around to face the entrance to the room. The woman from half an hour ago was dead, and something else had replaced her. She was nearly unrecognizable, the water halving apparently washed away her hardened exterior along with the grime. Even her voice and her word choice were different. It was incredibly. He found himself able only to dumbly nod in response to her request.

Though she had requested the both of them chop up the table, wood to burn wouldn't do much good without somewhere to contain the fire, so he and Theo quickly agreed that he should go outside and collect some bricks to create a makeshift firepit. The idea of going out into the infected-patrolled streets hardly thrilled him, but the streets had been mostly empty when they arrived, so he could only hope they'd still be now.

The first thing he noticed upon exiting the building was the body, if it could even be called that. The infected corpse had been torn apart until little besides bone remained. A blanket of feathers was draped across the mostly skeletal remains. It appeared their avian friends did not discriminate based on such silly factors as whether or not one was infected. It was equal parts relieving and horrifying. *I wonder if Jack's corpse looks like that now.*

The thought had appeared in his mind without any invitation, and had brought with it a sudden sense of sorrow. In the frantic struggle for survival that occupied the past day of his life, he'd kept himself mostly distracted. But now, front and center, reality had reappeared. Jack was dead. Gone. Never to be seen again.

The two had met in elementary school, quickly becoming best friends. Jack had apparently taken Klaus's tendency towards solitude as a personal challenge, slowly drawing him out of his shell. The two were nothing alike in a great many ways. Klaus was introverted, Jack was extroverted. Klaus thought things out carefully, Jack rushed in without thinking. Klaus relied more on dexterity, while Jack took a slightly more brute-force approach to things. The two were in many ways opposites of one another. Perhaps that was why they got along so well. They counterbalanced one another, keeping the other from falling too much towards on extreme. 

That wasn't to say their friendship kept them from doing rash things by any stretch of the imagination. No, not at all. One incident stood out particularly well in Klaus's mind. In high school, when most boys were focused on doing increasingly idiotic things to win the attention or favor of some girl or another, his focus had been elsewhere. The object of his desire was another boy, one with the nickname Basco, apparently derived from an incident in middle school involving a few gallons of Tabasco sauce. Klaus never had been able to get all the details on that. He'd spent the better part of a year working up the courage to approach him, but in the end, Jack pushed him into asking Basco out. Thankfully, the answer had been a yes.

Their relationship ended up going spectacularly. It was an odd pairing for sure, the kind Klaus imagined teenage girls who devoted their lives to anime and yaoi might dream up. Yet it worked. The pocket knife, in fact, had been a gift from Basco on their one-year anniversary. Of course, such a relationship was hardly safe from the cruel words of the average high school student. It didn't matter to Klaus though, who generally didn't give a damn what others thought of him. Jack, however, didn't quite operate on those same principles. And that was how Klaus found himself sitting in a sterile hospital room as the doctor carefully sewed up the wounds in Jack's hands. Another student had approached them after school one day, apparently very keen on informing Klaus that he was a faggot. This was by no means a revelation for Klaus, who was well aware of his own sexual orientation and of the variety of disparaging words that existed to describe it, but before he could say as much in response, Jack had slammed his fist into the boy's face. No formal report was filed, as this would require the other student to swallow his shame and admit that he'd had his ass handed to him in such a humiliating manner. That hardly rescued Jack from trouble though, as his hand has been sliced open on the kid's teeth. It was altogether an incredibly stupid thing to do, yet Klaus couldn't help but feel grateful, in an odd sort of way, knowing that Jack had his back.

But now, Jack was dead. In any likelihood, Basco probably was too. As were his parents. The world he'd grown up in had disappeared overnight, taking with it everybody he cared about. For the first time since the outbreak, Klaus realized just how alone he was. First on tear came. Then another. Taking advantage of his temporary separation from the others, he cried openly, mourning the loss of everyone he knew.

After pulling himself together, and letting enough time pass for the evidence of his crying to vanish from his face, he collected the necessary bricks and brought them back inside. Theo had finished with the desk, so the three of them prepared a fire. Hot dogs were hardly his favorite food in the world, but with enough hunger, even old hot dogs tasted like ambrosia. Dinner was a silent affair for the most part, which Klaus didn't object to. He simply ate in silence. 

The silence was broken, however, as Theo requested his name. Right... in the chaotic events of the last few hours, he'd never had time to give Theo his name. He'd told Mary, but she certainly didn't seem to care at the time. Given how she hadn't used it since, he imagined she didn't even remember it. ""My name's Klaus,"" he answered. ""Sorry for not mentioning it earlier."" And that was, more or less, the extent of the conversation for the night. He was too tired and focused on other things to attempt much of a conversation, and that seemed to be the case for the others as well. So, with a few simple words, the three concluded their dinner, returned to the theatre, and quickly fell asleep in their respective beds.",1441293216,"of course, she was wild and reckless, but such things were paid little attention their parents.","wild and reckless","reckless",NA,FALSE,"wild and reckless","wild",NA,NA,0

"cumfvgz","One night about six years ago, I decided to go for a late night bike ride to clear my head. I didn't plan to go far, but it was an unusually beautiful fall night, so I made a decision to bike out to a state park about six miles away.

The park was eerie and unlit by electricity. I vividly remember navigating by watching the trees in my peripheral vision. It was stupid and reckless, but exhilarating -- silence except for the sound of the bike on the road, darkness except for the starry sky, and true solitude.

As I neared the exit to the park, I hit a slight downhill grade and saw an electric light on a utility building welcoming me back to civilization. I coasted, feeling better than I had in a long time.

Suddenly, I was airborne.

It seems strange, but I swear in that split second I remembered hearing that people tend to tense up in accidents which hurts them worse and so I tried to stay loose. The next second I was sprawled out on the pavement gasping for breath. I stayed still, trying to breathe, trying to determine whether I could still feel and/or move my legs. Gradually I could breathe. Gradually I could move. I got lucky, but I still felt wetness on my hand. I was still too far away from the light to see, but I felt good enough to get up.

My bike was wrapped in a chain, unlit, strung across the road -- at the exit of a one-way loop. I disentangled it, and attempted to ride. My feet spun on unresistant pedals; the chain had come off the gears. I walked the bike over to the light to fix the chain, and got to look at my hand.

It was covered in blood, but more or less intact. The tip of my middle finger was a bloody mess. My face hurt a little, but didn't seem to be too bashed up. All in all, I was really lucky.

Unfortunately, I hadn't brought my cell phone on what I thought was going to be a short night ride. I mounted once again, cradling my damaged hand, and biked the three miles to the hospital.",1441065190,"it was stupid and reckless, but exhilarating -- silence except for the sound of the bike on the road, darkness except for the starry sky, and true solitude.","stupid and reckless","reckless",NA,FALSE,"stupid and reckless","stupid",NA,NA,0

I don't know why, but people these days seem to have very little patience when it comes to characters on TV.

"cu1wyoi","Yes but safety is not the same as morality, I'm not sure how you got those mixed up. Just because an action *may* cause harm to someone, does not mean it's necessarily immoral. Every action you do has the possibility of indirectly having an adverse effect on someone else so saying something might cause harm to someone else if the situation is just right, really has nothing to do with morality.

The reason being that, let's say know we that at 2:00 am at specific point on a specific road, a drunk driver will pass by and that exact point in time and space, loose focus and swerves out of his/her lane. Let's say you were an unknowing driver on that road who is also speeding, you might pass that point in time and space before the drunk driver does, thus preventing a collision because you were driving over the speed limit.

Now that's not to say you should always speed or you should never speed or you should drive way under the speed limit. The point is that you have no control over how your actions will indirectly or at times, even directly impact someone else.

The argument could also be made then that perhaps killing some in cold blood might save lives later on down the road as who knows what impact that will have? The reason the murder is wrong and not breaking a traffic law is that going to someone with a loaded gun with the intention of shooting them is intended harm. You go into that situation meaning to cause harm, death, pain, etc. When you speed, you're doing it to cause any sort of negative reaction.

So at best you can consider breaking traffic laws unwise and reckless, but certainly not immoral.",1439493422,"so at best you can consider breaking traffic laws unwise and reckless, but certainly not immoral.","unwise and reckless","reckless",NA,FALSE,"unwise and reckless","unwise",NA,NA,0
"cu190tv","The problem is they can't consent and we have no idea if they're enjoying it or not as they can't tell us.

"ctxx95o","I wouldn't have turned Ray and Frank into blonde horror film characters. 

Ray literally ran for the woods. He could have gone *anywhere*, as they showed that Burris wouldn't kill him with even the *possibility* of witnesses, and that it was strictly a non-police sanctioned hunt (by showing the patrol car Ray passes). Ray could have driven to a mall, a rental car station, a hotel and gotten a taxi cab and even slowly load his stuff into the cab in front of a hotel and all the witnesses.  Ray could have gone to LAX and bought a plane ticket and enter the metal detectors and then escape his unarmed captors.  He could have driven into a gas station and fueled up, and he could have 100% outlasted the SUV gas guzzler with 5 guys/1000lbs of weight in it on a long term pursuit. Once they run out of gas on a freeway, he's GONE. 

He could have done any of these things. 

Instead, he runs for the woods, where he loses any advantage of the LA sprawl and population density of witnesses and goes to a place where a single defensive gunshot gives away his position. And that's what happened. And he died. 

Frank?

Let's see. He just got $4.5 million. He has friends, the same friends that would go to a Mexican standoff for him. Why not use some of that $4.5 million -- even $500k or $1 million -- and hire a ten man gang for 24 hours? You don't think Frank's old gang would take $100k each to protect him for one day? And frank would even supply the weapons!

This is a ""45 year old gangster,"" and you don't live that long as a gangster by being stupid and reckless -- but he was reckless. He didn't hire protection, something he did his entire life. He goes solo. Solo after burning down 2 businesses, robbing $13 million, killing a bunch of people. Hell, he offered $500k to the Armenians to make sure he makes it there alive -- why not just kill them? They had no problem having him killed. 

I'm not even complaining about the desert stuff, but the fact that Frank had nearly $5 million and didn't spend a dime on protection.  He's not a newbie. He's done this for decades. But he acts like the ""criminals"" from Office Space and Fargo like he's never committed a crime and has no idea what ""heat"" is. 

So, like Ray, Frank dies because he's alone and corners himself. 

Worst part -- they were both headed to the exact same location!!! Ani and Jordan ended up together.  Frank and Ray could have ridden together, and doubled their chances for survival. 


I have no problem with the idea of them dying. I have tons of problems with how they died.  Made zero sense. Totally contrived deaths to give viewers a right to call it a ""Greek tragedy.""  No. Stop that. None of this was tragic. I was rooting for them to get killed because of the decisions they made. A tragedy would be an undeserving death.

"ctqrock","&gt; No, but if you're taking something to thwart god's will and it has the potential to kill a human, it is morally equivalent to murder.

You're folding a couple of unrelated issues together and producing a conclusion that simply doesn't follow.  Whether Plan B thwarts God's will or not is one issue, and whether Plan B kills people is another one.  Right now, the science is pretty clear that it probably doesn't kill anyone.  Research is ongoing and we can never be completely sure, but the best information we have right now says that it only prevents conception, nothing more.  We can never be completely sure that taking Tylenol for a headache won't result in a chaos-theory-esque situation that ends up killing someone, but that doesn't mean taking Tylenol is equivalent to murder.

Every time you get behind the wheel of a car, you're taking a small risk that you might kill yourself or another, yet you drive anyway.

IMO, she's 21 (like me for the record) and probably doesn't have THAT much experience with break-up feelings. Idk if she has even directly connected her fear of death with, I'm guessing, feeling trapped in a relationship she may have grown out of or just doesn't feel will last.

"cs8445c","&gt; That's the part the left ALWAYS misses

Not sure why you think this is a problem with the left. Many liberals foam at the mouth when talking of sending manipulative fat-cat bankers to jail. It's a pretty typical liberal position to think these private sector bankers are unchecked crooks and liberals want to end their reign as much as conservatives want to end big government.

Personally, I was fairly convinced that when the dust settled, a good number of people would be going to a minimum security prison. But due what appears to be a general lack of legal culpability and ""technically legal"" mischief, this pretty much didn't happen.

Repealing the glass-steagall legislation enabled some conflicts of interests that were no longer even illegal; banks were allowed to both short and provide ratings on the same investments, which is dangerously close to becoming an outright racket. Which creates tons of profit but ends in a bubble burst in short order. The law could have done with some updating, but repealing it outright was a mistake and it enabled reckless, but legal behavior.

Personally I would start with at least beefing up [Respondeat superior](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respondeat_superior) again. Meaning, if no one can figure out who made the illegal decision, the boss has to take the full heat and possibly go to jail. It makes being upper management of a bank a lot less pleasant, but scaring them into delegating more accountability throughout the organization would probably be a good thing.

"craehyq","Jani and I had been good friends for nearly four millenia. We had ascended to immortality together, fought together, ruled together, and even killed each other several times as we played games for various thrones. We had our share of disagreements, most of which were resolved with combat (like whether or not to let our wives in on immortality - I won that one with a decapitation).

As mortal technology improved, we'd had to make efforts to be more careful. Unexplained bodies would be awkward. We were still young and reckless, but we were careful where it counted. Or so we thought.

Jani and I were having a friendly duel atop the Bank Tower. A poorly calculated parry, a misstep, and he'd tripped and impaled himself on my sword. Of course, we both knew he'd be fine, but immortality never included an immunity to pain. Jani de-skewered himself, stumbled around, tripped down the roof access ladder, and landed in a bloody heap directly in front of a janitor.

By the time the elevator reached the first floor, three policemen were waiting to take me into custody. Centuries of combat training were quickly nullified with a well-placed taser.

Coroner's report: Death by exanguination due to large stab wounds through the torso. The charges: One count of first-degree murder, two counts of weapons possession, one count of resisting arrest, three counts of aggravated assault on an officer. There were also civil charges from the building management who had to pay to clean up the mess and pay for the janitor's therapy.

Still, Jani was fine. However, ""he got a new body from his regeneration chamber at home"" isn't exactly a court-admissible argument. And neither Jani nor I were about to reveal the technology behind immortality.

I almost got free. Once. It was in the custody bathroom of the courthouse. No glass mirror, no ceramic toilet or sink. Nothing that a mortal could hurt himself with - but I wasn't a mortal. I promptly stuck my head into the toilet and inhaled as much water as I could. My lungs screamed for oxygen, but I ignored it. I felt consciousness slipping away. I'd done something similar to this once before. A Roman guard once thought it would be fun to lock a random stranger (me) in his cellar. I had drowned myself in a washing bucket, then returned and drowned *him* in a bucket of hydrofluoric acid. There'd be no need for the hydrofluoric this time though...

And then I was on the floor, coughing up water. I rolled over, staring up at the courthouse medic. They never left me alone after that.

The verdict came down - guilty on all counts. Sentence: thirty years to life.

I tried everything to get out, but I was quickly placed on mental observation. All I got for my trouble was a nice padded cell and constant supervision.

Two years later, Jani came to visit. According to the prison records, it was Jani's ""brother"".

""Sorry I couldn't visit sooner. You know how long it can take to get a new identity, especially when you have to invent a new family member.""

""Well, I've been locked up for longer. What did you tell them?""

""That reconciling with you would provide some closure. I assume you want out?""

""Of course. I've been in a padded cell. Could use a change of scenery.""

""As soon as I can find a way to get you out, I will. You have my word.""

Sure enough, on his next visit, Jani slipped me a razor. ""I bribed the guard. You know what to do.""

That night, after lights out, I slit my throat, and my wrists too, for good measure. In a matter of seconds, I was dead.

*beep..... beep..... beep....*

The familiar regeneration chamber was delightful. I opened the cover and -

Wait a second.

Someone had walled up the exit to the room.

""Hello.""

I whirled, ready for combat - and tripped. My new body was still a bit unsteady.

There, on a TV screen, was Jani. ""This is a pre-recorded message, so don't bother replying. Remember that argument we had about a thousand years after we became immortal? I wanted to make my wife immortal and you said no? I have never forgiven you for that. You know what they say nowadays - keep your friends close and your enemies closer. You haven't been my friend these last three millennia. Anyways, while you were in the state prison, I went ahead and turned this room into another prison. It took me a while. I had to be sure you wouldn't die prematurely. I've blocked up the exits and the ventilation, and after this messages finishes, your regen chamber will be destroyed, locking you into that body. You're going to spend the next eternity suffocating to death, again, and again, and again.""

Not reckless, but incredibly stupid. When I was 22 I still lived in my hometown but not with my parents. I lived out in the boonies in a small house with a buddy of mine. It was Christmas Day, so I had spent the previous evening at my parents house and was returning home to drop off my presents before lunch with the whole family. The road leading to my house was a small country road and as I turned onto it and sped up to about 40 MPH, I spotted a deer head (JUST the head, which was really weird) lying in the middle of the road. I panicked, sped up instead of slowing down (I was young and stupid) and drove straight over it. Long story short, I had to call my dad on Christmas Day to explain to him that there was a hole in the radiator and the hose had been ripped out by the antlers, and that my car was no longer drivable.

"cr4q7kl","I would refine that definition to ""it's okay to gank a losing lane, but don't gank a lost lane.""

If you have a mid laner who, say, got counter picked, and by ten minutes has given up one kill but is somewhat close in CS (let's say within 10 of the other laner), that lane is losing, but still salvageable.  If you gank that lane and get a kill for your mid laner, you can let the wave crash into the tower and deny enough CS and XP that, with decent wave clear, the CS will even up, meaning you just made the lane even with a single gank *while also putting yourself up an assist and wave XP*.  Adding onto that, when the laners are fairly even, a gank is still pretty safe and easy, unless the champ itself is hard to gank, so you don't need to over exert to get anything.

If, in the same span of time (the 10 minute mark), that laner has died three or more times (including getting solo killed repeatedly by the laner, not just a camp, because if they are getting camped, you should address that by matching pressure either in their lane or elsewhere, situationally) and is down 40 or more CS, then your player is clearly overmatched, and ganking *won't* even up the lane, or even come close to it, if successful, and you have no guarantee that the kills will turn the lane, because if someone was capable of repeatedly dying 1v1 or 2v2 while even the first time, and then again while behind, they are probably capable of doing it again once you reset the lane.  On top of that, the investment you have to make to *successfully* gank a lane that is stomping (be it killing them or just pressuring them out of lane) is much more: more ults, more summoners, more time, and sometimes, more people.

On the other side of that coin, past a certain point it's not worth ganking a lane that's *too far ahead*.  If your ADC is 6/0 and up 30 or more CS, a tower, and a full BF sword on the enemy ADC, ganking isn't going to matter much, because they can basically 1v2 anyway.  You can be a part of the kill, but after so many deaths, the kill bounty is meaningless, so you don't actually get much from it.  If they are 6/0 and up a tower, and *still* haven't left their lane, then they're probably not going to help another lane no matter how far ahead they are, so it's better to use the pressure they put on bot as a pivot point to swing mid lane with your own pressure, and simply match roaming pressure to bot so your ADC can do their thing.

As with all things in this game, you have to make a risk assessment on your choices of which lane to pressure, and decide what will get you the best return on investment.  Ganking a lane that is even to get it ahead, or ganking a lane that is ahead to get it snowballing, probably have the best return on investment, because **the investment is low** (the ganks are much safer/easier to execute when ahead) and **the return is high** (the lane can possibly repeat kills with the advantage you gave them, and you also get pressure with the advantage you gained).  

Ganking a lane that is losing, but salvageable, is next, because **the investment is high** (turning a losing lane takes more effort because they are ahead, unless they are playing stupid and reckless), but **the return is also high** (turning a losing lane even means you stop a snowball and allow that laner to actually get ahead in the future, which makes it now the best place for you to return to, see above; also, you get ahead relative to the enemy jungler).

Ganking a lane that is completely snowballed against you is actually behind that, because **the investment is low** (pitifully easy to pressure someone who has been crushed out of lane, though you might need to extend pretty far to do it; you can use this opportunity to get vision or counter jungle, though, so the extension justifies itself), but **the return is low** (kill bounty is zilch when someone is 0/5/0, your presence doesn't change much as regards actual pressure except perhaps how quickly towers fall).  In other words, your presence doesn't actually change the game in a snowballed lane, so you mostly weigh your stay there against the opportunity cost of doing something else, elsewhere on the map.  It's fine to gank a lane like this as a crime of opportunity, like if you're there and all your camps are cleared, or you want to free them up for dragon/Baron; but in cases like this, it's sometimes better to just focus on making yourself personally strong by farming, or deny the enemy jungler by counterjungling the side of the map near your snowballed lane.

Last is ganking a lane that has spun completely out of control and is snowballing against you, because **the investment is high** (you basically need to pitch a tent and/or call over adjacent laners to 2v1/3v1, because they are so far ahead that they can conceivably 2v1 if you misplay; expect to blow sums and ult) and **the return is low** (the lane is still snowballed against you when you leave, and the laner has just reset themselves, and will likely die again).  Basically, turning a lane that is snowballed against you requires that *somebody else falls behind*, whether it's the jungler losing out on valuable clear time to camp the lane relentlessly, or the adjacent laners leaving lane and losing CS/XP to roam on the enemy repeatedly.  At that point, the strategy that loses you the least is to try get an equally strong snowball roaming in the opposite direction, which can hopefully crush the other snowball when they inevitably clash: this strategy has a relatively low investment (see above) and a higher return, while also hopefully producing the same result (their snowball stops, if a little later).",1431285172,"ganking a lane that is losing, but salvageable, is next, because **the investment is high** (turning a losing lane takes more effort because they are ahead, unless they are playing stupid and reckless), but **the return is also high** (turning a losing lane even means you stop a snowball and allow that laner to actually get ahead in the future, which makes it now the best place for you to return to, see above; also, you get ahead relative to the enemy jungler).","stupid and reckless","reckless",NA,FALSE,"stupid and reckless","stupid",NA,NA,0

"cpybkv2","Well first of all you need a cocky, but confident tank commander who can't help but put his crew into dangerous situations. (Of course, they always survive) This will help the general aesthetic of the tank, especially if you get one that looks very rugged. Then your tank bound to be a hit with the ladies.

Next up you need a gunner, to fire the gun at targets and to properly aim the howitzer. A good gunner is usually of the *countriyies recklities* variety. (Otherwise known as someone who is reckless but lovable, and from the southern regions of the United States) Though this species of gunner is known to be bad it its job in the least needed times, in times of need it can spring into action and quite possibly save the entire crew. 

A loader is necessary as well. This part of the tank (howitzer specifically) serves the purpose of loading the all important gun. He is usually a minor character in the tank, and is known for being unimportant, but unnaturally strong. The best gunners are always quiet, but have a deep and sad past. 

Last but not least, we have the driver. One of the most important parts of the tank. The driver usually incorporates all the features of the other components of your tank into itself. Commander, Gunner, Loader, etc. Though the commander will most likely be the one to sacrifice himself for the good of the rest of the crew at the end of your tank's life cycle, the driver will most likely also perform some sort of important courageous act at some point.

I hope this helps.

"cpxkl4i","I'm brainwashed? No.  I give to charity when I can, I volunteer, I do my part to make society better but not because an oppressive government tells me to. Apparantly you have some twisted notion that all businesspeople are the boogeyman out to get you. In my experience the vast majority of them tend to be reasonably normal, humble people. I work with bankers, marketers, government officials and the like. Sure you'll get a few ego freaks but the vast majority just want to live their lives. And to be sure every CEO, Managing Partner and executive that I know would do everything they could to save children's lives if they could. Many companies even have their own charities and philanthropies and I've even seen mandatory volunteer service programs at companies like All State, and some are unknown to the public if you planned to say that's only for PR or tax purposes. Your notion of business is evil, government is good is overly simplistic and unfounded. I've seen government crooks that are far worse than any manager I've ever heard of. Also most finance CEOs are Democrats. JP Morgan's(Largest financial company in US; never bailed out) James Dimon(pretty decent guy) is a democrat, so is Goldman Sachs's Lloyd Blankfein(sleazebag), and Berkshire Hathaway's Warren Buffett(pretty good guy) etc. I am a DEMOCRAT. They don't mind regulation so long as it is reasonable for the vast majority of people in their companies who AREN'T CROOKS and doesn't unnecessarily cripple their business for the people who invest, work, and have made it their life's work.

Also fuck BP okay, I give zero fucks about BP. The environment is important and truth be told solar energy production is quite cheap bu the oil companies are set in their ways, in a few years time though that will change as solar prices crush FFs in energy production. Until then we wait and see it play out. Also I'm sure that BP's management didn't say one day let's fuck the world and blow up an oil pipe underwater, it just happened. The cost of fixing irreparable damage should fall on the firm and that's that but with government it never works out that way. 

Companies ought to be socially responsible, data shows that socially responsible firms do better than ones that are not and hence even if businessmen only cared about money doing that would still be in their best interest. But again managers are human too and they do care but they unlike what  you propose they usually know that they can't save the whole world. Either they can provide a service or they can not do so and the way they do it is at their discretion. They are privately owned/ operated. Some are better in moral responsibility some are worse, none are prefect but they do try from what I've see and what the data does show. BP is a hot mess in moral responsibility and that's that. I don't believe in bailouts. Taxpayer money should not go to any organization that doesn't immediately benefit the taxpayer. SOCIALIZING EXPENSES IS WRONG. There I said it. But forcing JP MOrgan to buy Washington Mutual out of bankruptcy wasn't fair either. That puts that burden of one company's mistake on to another's shareholders of which I am one, albeit not much. There are greedy, narrow minded fucks among us in business but I'm asking you to not paint us ALL in broad strokes. We have conscience too, and most of us follow ours in making ethical decisions. 

And here's the thing about money, from an economics and PR major, it is way less useful than people think and business managers know this better than most. Money is simply a claim on production, without production it is useless since there is nothing to trade it for. So the whole greed fallacy falls apart there unless businesses produce something that people will trade their money for. And to finalize I hope to end up in executive management someday and if I do I hope that I don't end up a greedy, public fucking, asshole like you think all managers and directors are required to be. Ethics is a big part of business, people on the outside like you just don't see it at work and the bottom line is maybe guys like me as well as my father,an MBA degree holder in business ethics, who are ethics and compliance officers for firms aren't doing enough to be as ethical as possible or maybe you just will never be satisfied. 

You and I are not so different. We recognize the same problems just from different paradigms and with differing solutions. On a side note, if you were to accept private sector solutions from BP, GS, etc. what would they be? That is what should these firms ideally in your opinion have done, say if you were in charge? Just out of curiosity for your thought process.

&gt;Do you know what happened in 1994 that created the system the bankers used to gamble recklessly because a COMBINATION of as you crudely put ""housing for everyone"" and derivatives which was exactly what you described.

What I described are capital securities not derivatives. Derivatives are dangerous, any good finance professor will drill that into students' heads in an investment class. They are not to be played with as they are leveraged which means that all gains and losses are multiplied by 100. But when it's someone else's money like in the case of fast and loose investment managers in the early 2000s they didn't care and took the risk. At first times were good, then when markets went down their losses got multiplied and they got fucked real good or rather their clients did. Unethical is the word I'd use. 1994 was the dot com bubble because everyone even biology majors like that idiot charlatan wolf of wall street played broker and securitized tech companies which had no assets to grant their stocks value. That is the definition of reckless. Especially since all of these internet companies eventually failed. The only success to come out was Amazon.com. 

Finance is not intrinsically reckless but too many people fucked up all at once in the tech and mortgage hysteria. Trust me the train wreck looks even worse when you have a finance education. But adding government into the mix doesn't help it just piles things on top. The problem isn't Wall St its the system's vulnerability to hysteria that leads to these things but that's just human nature.

Nearly to death?  That's a pretty big exaggeration.  I don't think we ever even saw any bruises on either of them.  Yes, he was violent and out of control, and it was only a matter of time before something bad happened, but it's a big stretch to say he nearly killed both his wife and child.

&gt;He then tried to kill Rick.

He tried to kill Rick because he's volatile and he was drunk.  He was certainly a problem, and should have been killed (if we're playing that game).  But let's remember that his entire problem was contained within his house and within his alcoholism.

&gt;He then, again, purposely [tried to?] kill Rick.  When Reg stood in his way, he killed him with no remorse.

That's not even accurate.  He only pushed Reg away.  He ended up cutting his throat because he was drunk and out of control.  He was a problem because he was violent and reckless, but he didn't go there to murder anyone.  At least, not Reggie.

"cpbbw44","Hey Guys! I am a bettor for quite a long time already and I want to start analysing for Katowice, as Im pretty much into the whole cs go scene. I would like to recieve contstructive criticism.

**EnVyUs**: 
EnVyUs is obviously one of the best teams outside if not even the best team right now. They won the last major and secured a win at MLG Aspen aswell. In the last Tournament on LAN they got knocked out by fnatic in the Semi-Finals. They were in a slope lately when they lost 4 online matches in a row and they seemed pretty disappointed about it aswell. And it seems like they worked some things out, which worked pretty well, as they are on a winning streak again and look pretty strong. The mappick will play a huge role in this matchup. If it is going to be Dust2 then SmithzZ needs to paly his A Game and get the entry frags and also win the duels vs the God kennyS. Shoxie has to be on point and get the entry frags, like we know him. While these two players need to step up, Happy, Kio and NBK are pretty default players which are VERY strong in holding a bombside. 

**Titan**:
Titan is obviously a team which plays around kennyS. 
They do everything to get an AWP in his hands and we know exactly why. I don't think I need to say much about him. Still there are other players on the team. In my opinion apeX is a monster aswell. He is doing really nice plays and is probably the most aggressive entry fragger in the game. Sometimes he just does some reckless but unexpected pushes and gets 2 entrys on the bombside. in my opinion he is a really strong aimer and can outgun the nV players. But he has his good and bad games. Same as kennyS. When they lost vs CLG at the Katowice Qualifiers both of them had a really rusty start and started heating up at the end of the game. They nearly made a 7-15 comeback but lost 14-16 at the end.
Ex6ten, Rpk and Maniac are not showing up much usually, but still do quite a fine job at holding their lanes. Titan really rely on apeX and kennyS to get the entry on T side.
Still Rpk shows some good stuff, while Maniac and Ex6 go like 6-20 sometimes.

**Conclusion**:
This is a though match to predict since the map is unknown and its a BO1. This can go easily in Titans favor as we saw at Asus ROG where they won every Bo1 in the groupstage except vs. VP.
I would still give the advantage to nV as they are a higher skilled team overall, they show some really good teamplay and also they are a championship team, while Titan isn't in my eyes yet.
If they can shut kennyS and apeX down, i can see them win this easily. But don't forget, its the groupstage and we are talking about BO1 games.

I was in a somewhat unique position in that I could use all the other facilities on campus (gym, showers, computer rooms, various hidden places) until around ten at night and then just sleep in the library. After a few weeks I really tried to avoid spending time there during the day and was completely sick of the place but I had so much to keep me occupied that it didn't really matter. I hired a big storage locker near kings cross for about 20 quid a month and kept most of my stuff there and also used a number of smaller lockers on campus. The security guards at the library knew what I was doing but I was always presentable, polite and discreet and was still a full time student at the university, so had 24 hour access. Members of the public could also access the library, but only from 8am to midnight, and there were a number of people who seemed to stay in or around the library during this period and then disappear at midnight and reappear at 8am. There was one lady who I believe would go to the 24 hour McDonalds nearby at night, sit there for eight hours and then come back. But the library was crowded during the day, especially since it was exam season, and the security guards would kick these people out for sleeping.

John Carpenter calls this his Apocalypse Trilogy, because all of the movies end with no hope for the survivors, with everyone else either dead or not human anymore, and all of them do/can present us with an end-of-humanity scenario (The Thing getting to civilisation, Satan being let loose on earth, The Old Gods coming back and killing/transforming us into their image)

But what if there was more to it than being a thematic trilogy? What if all of the movies are actually related and take place in the same world?

Let's skip forward to Prince of Darkness first. Scientists are brought together to study a living liquid, which is later revealed to be Satan, an alien that seeks to possess and corrupt humanity, that came down to earth millions of years ago and was fought and defeated by God, another alien. They were viewed by humans as spiritual creatures, because at the time they were way beyond having the cultural and technological point of reference to understand what an alien was and what lay beyond the tallest mountains..

Satan is defeated/retreats (I haven't seen it in a while, so the details may be a little off) into the jar and waits for a long time to find someone that he can control. When the jar opens, liquid sprays out, and this liquid is 'Satan', which possesses people.

Rewind back to The Thing.
It crashed down to earth hundreds, thousands, millions of years ago, for some unknown reason. It leaves the safety of it's ship and gets frozen in ice, to be uncovered by one very unlucky group of Norwegians. It kills them all, disguises itself as a dog, and runs off to the American outpost.

Now the link between the two is currently pretty flimsy, but if you think about it, you can see it.. When The Thing is assimilating the dogs, the one part that always stood out the most to me was the one short bit where it's spraying a jet of liquid at one of the dogs, which turns out to be pretty close to how Satan possesses people in Prince of Darkness - it's a living liquid that hoses people down and possesses them..
So, early on in earth's history, the God-alien chased the Satan-alien to earth to try and defeat it, which gives us Prince of Darkness.. but what if there were two ships? What if The Thing crashing into the Arctic was the result of the God-alien shooting down one of two ships, seeing it crash to earth, and figuring that The Thing died on impact while it went after the Satan-alien?

The Thing infects/copies living organisms.. So, when the Satan-liquid comes out of the jar, it infects some bugs, first.. cockroaches, specifically, which leave the church and start infecting the homeless..
As for why The Thing morphed and slaughtered and the Satan-alien didn't; The Thing's ship crashed, it landed in the Arctic, left it's ship, and froze to ""death"".. it's last thoughts were that it was going to die, and then it spends thousands of years frozen in ice..

It wakes up confused and pissed off, maybe even scared.. As soon as it assimilates a person, it knows it's out in the middle of nowhere and could very easily be trapped again, so it gets pretty gun-ho about trying to assimilate and kill people.. If you factor in the new 2011 The Thing prequel into it, The Thing seems more savage, agile and reckless in it's choices of when to change shape and try to absorb a new person, and when it's made it to the American outpost, it realizes it can't take on the same strategy, so it's a lot more cautious and stealthy..

The Satan-alien, on the other hand, is sitting in it's jar and waiting for the time it thinks is right to come out.. it's been sitting by choice, thinking and plotting and keeping it's wits about, whereas The Thing had almost died and was frozen solid and thawed out thousands of years later.. it's like a confused, wild animal; it can't think right, it can't properly control itself, and it doesn't have the information that the Satan-alien has about the rest of earth, what it's inhabitants are like, etc., it's only information is from the minds of the people it's possessing, and this alien is a lot more brutal and primal.. The Thing is the muscle, the Satan-alien is the brains, though they share the same ""race"" and physiological traits..

A quick detour: [2nd last paragraph in this section](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Carpenter#1980s:_Continued_commercial_success); John Carpenter is into Quantum Physics, and Prince of Darkness was influenced by [theoretical physics and atomic theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_of_Darkness_(film)#Production), which could also tie into Quantum Physics/Mechanics.

So, back to Prince of Darkness: Satan-alien (which I now realize I should have been calling Antichrist-alien) tries to use it's ""powers"" to summon it's dad, the big-bad, using a mirror.. But what we see as magic could easily just be quantum mechanics.. If The Thing/Satan-alien are alive on a cellular level, and can have extreme control over it's shape, where every single drop or cell is a living being.. what's to stop it from altering, on a molecular level, a mirror, and re-arranging it to be a ""teleporter""/gateway to another planet?

It succeeds. Satan is loose, walks out of the church, the movie ends, humanity is fucked. But Satan-alien is smart, unlike The Thing; it doesn't just run around and assimilate and attack everyone it sees in broad daylight.. it quietly infects people, like how no one knew they were a Thing until they changed.. It covers it's tracks.. it slowly infects people and amasses it's army of Things..

And then, it assimilates a writer. His name is Sutter Cane.

Which brings us to In The Mouth of Madness; possibly the most Lovecraftian movie ever made. In this movie, Sutter Cane writes about his dreams and fantastical ideas, of these monsters and creatures taking over the earth.. but his early books, like The Hobbs End Horror, are a more one-on-one, monster-killing-a-few-people type of story..

Another side-track; Dark Horse made a series of The Thing comics, under the name The Thing From Another World. These are pretty much totally non-cannon to the movie universe, but there's one 4-part mini called Eternal Vows.

In Eternal Vows, The Thing has gotten control of itself; it's no longer as violent and savage, and it doesn't want to infect people any more, though it still needs to kill.. It's explained that The Thing is always dying, and it needs fresh cells to replace the ones that die, and that if it ""takes"" cells, but doesn't ""leave"" it's bad/dead cells, the person killed won't become a Thing..

The relevant part, though, is that The Thing is posing as a woman (mostly), and the woman constantly has trouble sleeping and gets nightmares from the memories of the people who's cells she absorbed to keep from dying.. She doesn't realize she's a Thing at first, and keeps having these nightmares that she's being attacked by monsters in different parts of town, which is really the memories she's absorbed of the people she's killed..

Back to In The Mouth of Madness; Sutter Cane gets infected by a Thing, but doesn't realize it. He suddenly has these visions and nightmares about people in a forgotten town getting attacked and killed by weird, shape-changing monsters, elder gods from before mankind that have been asleep for centuries/millennia...

Is this starting to sound familiar yet?

So he writes about them, and the books sell, and the Satan-alien sees that the books are selling like hotcakes, so with a few key possessions/assimilations, it owns the printing house/publisher, and into the ink goes The Thing liquid.. Anyone who picks up a book now has touched the living liquid of the Satan-alien and is now on their way to becoming a Thing, though they don't know it yet.. They hallucinate and see the stories, because now it's not just something they read, but a memory of an actual event that's been passed on like a genetic memory..

In The Thing, Blair works out that by 27,000 hours after The Thing comes into contact with civilization, the entire population of earth would be assimilated; that's a bit over three years.. In The Mouth of Madness starts in 1995, and Sutter Cane has been writing books for a while now.. But he's not infected with ""The Thing"", which is more brutal and reckless, but by the ""Satan-alien"", which is a slow, methodical planner.. it's been slowly infecting people, and finally with this last book, it's worked up enough of an army to pull off a full-on assault on humanity..

So, In The Mouth of Madness looks like it's happening during the summer time, and as things are starting to ""go to shit"", so to say, Sam Neil's character has been locked up in an asylum for at least 6 months, meaning the end of the movie would happen right around the new year, 1996. People all over the world now are changing into monsters, but there's still radio, electricity, etc., so civilization hasn't COMPLETELY ground to a stop, but it's definitely a world-wide apocalyptic-level epidemic..

Roughly three years later, in 1999, Brian finally manages to work with Tachyons to send the dream back to 1987, trying to warn the people in the church about Cathrine's eventual assimilation by the Satan-alien and to try and prevent the future from happening...

You are rationalizing the whole idea behind the core of the movie. Do you know why the Grave of the Fireflies ends like it does? Because the author of the story is still seeking redemption from letting his sister die (his story and Seita's are the same).

He made those stupid decisions, the ones you're seeing in the movie. His sister died, but he survived. As an adult he realized what he did was stupid, selfish and reckless, but having to carry the burden of your own life and your sibling's because of war is just too much for a kid that age.

"cp48k0n","Currently, I'm questioning whether I am an unhealthy INFJ (with really developed Ti and Fe) or an unhealthy ENTP (who gets worn out by people easily and often feels inhibited in some sort of way). Many people perceive me like they perceive ENTPs, in terms of creative, somewhat reckless but confident people who are driven by wild ideas and experiences. And to an extent, I view myself as such. My connection with people is usually a positive, but a more objective one. If I don't have an attachment to a person, and I find it hard to attach myself to others when they find it easy to attach to me, I feel free to not be socially inhibited. However, when it comes to the people I care for or I become attached to, I'm extremely mindful and prompt harmony as much as possible. I've identified with INFJs for sometime but I feel I'm maybe more reckless and risky than the next INFJ. I still deal with major problems of motivation. 
In short, I agree that these types are metaphysically very similar. I know this because people who don't know me seem to view me as an ENTP. And maybe I am? Maybe I'm actually an INFJ.

You go on to try and prove your point because Williams pressed Romney on important issues but gave Clinton a fluff interview. First, the circumstances were incredibly different. Romney was running to be the most powerful person in the world, Clinton's time had passed. Romney was a notable flip flopper and this interview was no different. All Presidents and nominees should answer for their past legislation as well as be able to take a stance on current topics. The only question that Williams posed that I thought was over the line was the 'boring white guy VP' question. I thought that was in poor taste. 

Second, all former Presidents get fluff pieces. It's the reason why the majority of the time W. talks about his paintings or books to reporters instead of why he thinks it's ok for America to shove hummus up the ass of our prisoners.

Bill O'Reilly spent 18 months yelling at his audience to get pissed at Obama for Benghazi. When the senate report, led by Republicans, found no wrong doing by the White House in regards to Benghazi O'Reilly didn't even mention it. That's not only reckless but incredibly dangerous. It's also reckless to suggest that O'Reilly isn't a news reporter when so many people get their news from him.

"cocc05p","I think the problem with the majority of deaths being in flashbacks is that those deaths don't affect the current storylines/characters. Those deaths are history, they have already affected people. The great thing about current storyline deaths is you get to see the aftermath and the effect those death have to characters how they are* right now*. You get to see current characters change, as opposed to flashback deaths where the changes to the other characters are already apparent/known. 

For example, we already knew Law was grim and reckless, but it would be cooler if there was a death that happened in the current storyline that made him that way, and we actually got to see that change. The changes in flashbacks are like flipping a switch because you eventually have to fastforward back to present time, or forward to another point in the flash back.

The best way to showcase how much better current deaths are is comparing how you felt about Ace dying, or Sabo supposedly dying. Ace's death was much more impactful upon first reading/watching, and keep in mind it wasn't apparent right after you read/watched the Sabo death that he survived. It took years of subtle clues for that to be more likely, so it was still a flashback death vs current death of brothers, and one was obviously much more impactful.. 

It's just that we see more from current character's so we are more attached, and being more attached means being more afraid of them dying, if we actually believe they can die that is. Flashback characters that die only exist in flashbacks, they can't interact with the world in the current time, so really they don't matter much, so you can get over their deathly fairly quickly.

"coby3lj","I've been on both sides.  The best analogy I use is:


You are trying to drive a car after only ever being a passenger.


You are used to drivers who are wild, reckless, fast.  But who drive because because driving is fun, can drive where they want, and don't care about the passenger.  You like the ride and don't have to do much.  It's nice in a way, when your input is ignored or disregarded.  But you get sick of it.  Sure it's fun but you want to go somewhere, not just drive in circles really fast.


And then you meet this guy.  The nice guy.  He not only doesn't drive, he's **looking at you to drive**.  And you're thinking, ""holy shit, how does this not know how to drive.  I will never experience the thrilling control I had from the other, better, faster drivers.""  And that dominates your thinking.  You can't get away from it.  Never mind that he know that the drive is long and difficult   He knows that any drive worth starting he will need help.  Driving takes a lot of energy and he's equally afraid of screwing it up.  If he's smart, he's also judging you as a passenger -- something that might be novel to you.


At this point, you have four options.  Option one, stay with him and not drive.  Eventually resent him, berate him for not driving fast, and seek other drivers to drive with that passionate but reckless speed.  Option two, leave him straight up.  Option three, stay with him and drive.  See what it feels like directing the relationship.  Be in control and learn about it.  See if it makes you cruel and manipulative or makes you wise and judicious.  Option four, stay with him and share the drive.  Teach him how to drive you fast.  Teach him how to be reckless but in control.  Let him set the pace other times.  Learn that driving fast is always the best driving.  It is a learning challenge for both persons.

"co8srlf","This is the thing though, we never really know what went down with the werewolf incident. Did Sirius actively try and lure Snape down to be killed? I doubt it. What seems more likely is that he made an offhand ""oh yeah you do on down on Friday, i'm sure you'll see something interesting"" not realising Snape would actually go down, know how to get in and confront Remus. I just think that seems more in line with the apparent lack of punishment etc.

Although on that note we know he wasn't expelled but beyond that we've no idea what happened. We don't know his punishment or how Remus reacted initially, all we know is all was forgiven at some point.

I think Sirius (all the marauders really) suffers from a lack of elaboration on their school time bar one awful Snape memory and a few throwaway comments. Sirius is not an awful person, he's a broken man. He was clearly a very loyal friend and passionate person, yeah he's arrogant and reckless, but he adores Harry and is a lovely human being to everyone bar Snape (not sure I can blame him there).

Oh and Sirius being a spoiled brat? Not sure where you're getting that one from. After leaving his family he lived in a tent for 2 years in his best friends garden (yeah probably a magical one but still), then went into deep hiding as part of an elaborate plan to keep his friends safe, was thrown in jail unjustly for 12 years then escaped. He eventually makes it somewhere exotic and safe but returns to survive on rats and live in a cave in order to try and keep Harry safe.

I don't think Sirius is anything like his family, he does hate Slytherins but only because of his experience with them beyond that he's got a few flaws and was a dick as a teenager (to Snape). Now on the other hand half his family joined a gang of murderous racists. Not quite the same imo.

I think he's ultimately a good man who let his popularity go to his head as a kid. Even that I can understand though, he lived with this horrible family who mistreated him awfully and his only escape is when he gets to school and gets to be this popular, loved kid. It even explains his actions towards Snape, he sees this dark wizard in the making who he can take his frustrations out on without consequence and he does.

"cnfdv7w","If your strategy against zoo is to run him out of cards, you're playing it wrong: it's 100% about the tempo. A handful of cards means nothing to zoo if you have board control. While zoo doesn't mind as much about card disadvantage as other decks, it also can't make good use of card advantage either.

Everyone is taught when they start playing card games that card advantage = good and therefore people who get card advantage are good players and deserve to win. But that's just a basic heuristic used to teach people the basics of card games: if it implied in every matchup, the game would be pretty simple and repetitive. What's wrong with having a few decks like zoo or mill rogue/druid that turn those ideas around?

To be honest I think the left and far left has to carry a big part of the responsibility for the situation that Sweden is in right now. Sweden has created for it self a political climate where almost any criticism against immigration policies are taboo. You have no idea how far in to complete ridiculousness this has gone.

I listened recently to half hour radio debate about the coming re-election*(now canceled because polls showed SD would probably have gotten even more delegates)* where the host and the interviewees(Socialist) couldn't bring them self to say ""immigration policy"" but instead referred to it as this ""this question/denna frågan"". They had to discuss it because it is the reason SD has gotten so many votes, but they also could not name it. Like it would cast some curse on them and their families.

Now you can imagine the frustration this causes for people who think this is an important question.

Could have misplaced his arm trying keep him back, or whatever. Like I said, not saying it was an accident or not. Either way it was reckless, but I still don't think it's worse than suarez. Suarez has a history of aggressive behaviour, in which he deliberately wants to cause harm to another player in order to succeed in the game or due to frustration that he hasn't succeeded. Personally I think he should have been banned for a year, or even banned from professional football completely. 

Anyway, my point is about intent to harm. It's not clear cisse did intend to harm Coleman, and seeing as cisse doesn't have a notorious history (or any particular history) of aggressive or violent behaviour on or off the pitch I think the benefit of the doubt can be given. Maybe a match ban as a warning or something. Suarez, on the other hand, does have a notorious history.

"cmyclod","The year was 1959. I had just gotten back from my time in Northern India. Our station there had just received an interesting guest on the run. 

Unfortunately our counterparts weren't happy about who we helped smuggle out of China.  

""A shame what happened to Troy huh?"" I said to Keller. 

""Those bastards really did a number on him. What details have they told you?"" Keller replied. 

""All I know about is the brain damage."" I said.
We sat in a cafe in Paris. The place looked a hell of a lot nicer than it had a mere 15 years ago. We just got debriefed on the situation in Asia. Tibet may not be going free but we did secure a major symbolic victory by rescuing that VIP.

""I always though Troy was a little young and reckless but he was usually smart. How'd they even catch him?"" I asked. 

Keller scoffed. ""Troy went and played the hero. He was in charge of getting a group of Ukrainian defectors through Hungary and into Switzerland. Apparently they were right near the border and the only way for the defectors to make it out was if a decoy cleared a path. So Troy took it upon himself and got those fucks out.""

""So Hungarian Intelligence got him?"" I asked.

""Right after the border patrol roughed him up."" Came Keller's reply. 

The waitress came over and handed us our coffee and croissants. Typical I know. When in Rome I guess. Or... Paris... shut up.

""Were you here?"" I asked. Keller gave me a look. ""During the War. Did you ever make it to Paris?""

Keller shook his head. ""I got routed north before the liberation. Got sent over toward Belgium.""

I nodded. ""It was something else. All the people so happy to be able to throw down the swaztika. Wave their French flags again. A whole lot better than Omaha."" 

We shared a moment of as we thought about our friends lost on the beaches back in Normandy. 

""I too lost friends at Normandy,"" Came a stranger's voice in French. Keller looked over to his shoulder to see a man slightly older than ourselves. He was at the table over from ours. His back was towards us. 

""How much did you hear buddy?"" I ask in French.

""Enough agents,"" he replied. He got up from his seat and dragged his chair to our table. My hand drifted towards my 1911 in my holster. 

""No need for that,"" the man said still in French. ""I'm unarmed. This is quite the chance meeting two Americans who fought at Normandy and are current CIA operatives.""

""Listen if you're some Commie..."" Keller started.

""No I am just a... citizen of the world."" The man replied. ""I would like to hear the ending of this story with your comrade Troy.""

Keller and I both nodded. He'd heard way too much as it was. Worst comes to worst we off him in an alley or something. 

Keller shrugged and continued. ""Well the Hungarians handed him over to the Russian KGB. We tried some Ops to get him out but they kept moving him. From what we've gotten out of Troy he spent some time in the Lubyanka. Shit's almost as bad as what them Krauts used to pull.""

I shook my head. I tried desperately everyday to unsee what I saw when my unit rolled into one of those camps. 

""But they moved him for some reason from Moscow all the way down to some station in bumfuck nowhere just bordering Turkey. Well our boys over in SOG got him out. Even gunned down two of theirs. But..."" Keller drifted off for a second looking like he was remembering something he wished he didn't have to. ""They were using the old head dunking technique and... I guess this guy was either a rookie or an extreme fucking sadist because... he kept him under too long. Deprived his brain of oxygen. Just enough so that for the rest of his life Troy is gonna suffer and never be the man he once was.""

This tough as nails former soldier and current CIA spook was holding back tears over what happened to Troy.

""I pity the poor bastard I really do,"" Keller said choking it all back.

""Me too man. Me too,"" I said.

""I do not."" Said the stranger. Still speaking god damned French.

""Listen you son of a baguette eating whore, I will..."" Keller began before I got him to calm down. 

""I mean no disrespect Agent,"" the man said in English. 

Huh. He has a weird accent for a Frenchman.

The man proceeded to unbutton his shirt partially and pull away to show a scar just below right nipple. It was a long scar that had obviously been made with a knife. 

""I got this,"" he said speaking in French again. ""Fighting at Normandy. Sword Beach if I recall. Hand to hand. I won obviously but... I was never proud of the way I got this scar.""

What was he doing at Normandy? And how does he not remember the beach he was on? Every man I've ever talked to, American, Canadian, British or otherwise could tell you what beach he fought on without even blinking.

""But, this scar..."" he said now pointing to the area just below his left collar bone. The scar would look like a bullet wound to an untrained eye but it was a frag wound. ""I got this shoving a comrade of mine away from a grenade. This scar I have worn with pride despite fighting in a war I wanted no part in.""

""What does this have to do with Troy?"" I asked getting annoyed. 

""This is my battle scar to prove what I did wasn't always right but sometimes it saved someone. Just like Troy's brain damage will be his scar. Let that remind you that yes he did play the hero. But that is not always such a bad thing.""

We sat there in silence. His profound words really getting to us. 

""Well I really must be going now,"" the man said as he rose. 

""One question,"" I said. ""Was the man who gave you that knife wound British or Canadian?""

The man smiled sadly. ""Canadian,""

""You were at Juno."" 

He nodded and smiled. ""I will try to keep that in mind,"" He said in English. I now recognized the German accent. ""Tschuss agents. Enjoy the new France,""

IRKUTSK - Our field office in Irkutsk has confirmed that the Crown-Prince is en route to the Russian Empire, bringing 400 mounted, armed companions. The Prince gave a few short words to our reporters before departing. ""This is not an act of war or political statement. I am not attacking the Russian people. I seek my brother and his bride. Something is not right about this, and I will find out what"". The Khan has insisted that he gave direct commands that action not be taken until more is known. He called the Crown Prince's stunt ""reckless, but understandable"". This after the disappearance of the Tsarina Katya from her and Prince Gantulga's wedding feast. Sources have indicated that her brother, the former Tsar Vladimir, is also missing. No word has been hear from the Tsarina or Prince Gantulga (who is said to now go by ""Leonid"" amongst his Russian subjects). The Crown Prince has not commented on his plan to find them, or even where he will look. All that seems to motivate him is the danger of losing his younger brother.

**Army Finally Adopts a Repeater**

ULAANBAATAR - Chinggis Arms Works' new [Mark III rifle](http://media.liveauctiongroup.net/i/12729/12883247_1.jpg?v=8CF1EAB1ACD43B0) is said to ""encompass the free, equestrian spirit of our people, both in its' design and function"". The new rifle is a lever-action, firing a 44 caliber round with an effective range of up to 150 meters. The design derives from the 1866 Winchester Musket, an archaic American weapon. The Mark III takes this original design and rifles the barrel, giving the weapon far greater accuracy. The Mark III is already entering service with much of the peacetime army, and by the end of the year will hopefully be stockpiled enough to equip a wartime army.

Shirou actually detected the attack through killing instinct even before it's fired, and still ended up hit by the shards after Berserker neutralizing most of it, making him unconscious and taking him a whole night to recover the wounds. Kiritsugu doesn't have the ability to sense things on the same level as Shirou. If it's Hrunting, then simply GG. I'm also pretty sure their scopes wouldn't detect enemies 4KM away. Sniper rifles covers barely 2KM range at best, at that far range heat scope won't even be able to filter them out. In a bad end of Hollow Ataraxia where Shirou does not recall his ability to use Rho Aias due to [FHA spoilers] (/s ""Shirou actually being Avenger, and at that point does not gain the knowledge of Shirou's projection""), **both Shirou and Saber got defeated by Archer's Hrunting**.

I guess brooding personality and hitman appearance, and acting cold made a much higher impact on people for being smart. Kiritsugu have also made many bad decisions throughout Fate/zero. No, Shirou actually was planning on summoning Saber, after he decided that the terrain was bad, he planned on summoning Saber when he leaves the forest so Saber has an even ground against Rider. He almost pulled it off too, singlehandedly fended off and made Rider retreat. If it wasn't for the chain on his hand, he would have made it to the exit. Once again, Shirou's goal isn't that. He would kill berserker, kill caster, and even kill masters if it's needed. He nearly snaps Shinji's neck off because he's a threat to the school in fate route. He was angry at Archer for letting Caster go. He didn't let Saber go to the temple **because Saber was just heavily injured a few days ago, and Rin considers going to Ryuudou temple dangerous**. Shirou, despite the fact of knowing that caster is draining people's mana, is level-headed enough to understand that going to the ryuudou temple is too dangerous. You assumed wrong. Like what I stated above for example, **it's level-headed thinking**. In the example of Caster's rule breaker, Shirou notices caster's plan. In Gilgamesh's case, he noticed Gilgamesh's identity before Saber did. In vs. Rin scene, he analyzed that due his leg wound he wouldn't be able to make it to the other stair so he went in the room, and when the boundary field is used, he quickly puts up a desk, knowing that Rin would follow up with a hail of magic bullets. Another example is against Lancer, he lands on the backyard, and parried Lancer without looking at him, because he analyzed that Lancer would definitely come after him, and the parry needs to be **perfect timing**, then concluded that Lancer is so much faster that there's no way he could parry too early, and swung the poster the moment he got up. Or against Saber Alter, where he tries everything he could to get Saber into giving an opening. This is furtherly proven when Shirou gains more experience, gaining the skill of Eyes of the mind (True), being able to calculate 10 steps ahead of Saber Alter. While Shirou isn't good at making plans ahead of time, and makes some decisions with very low regard to his own well-being, anyone who read the story could tell that Shirou is a **quick thinker**, despite forcing himself into these situations."")

Servants literally operates at supersonic speeds, this guy caught a supersonic slash with his elbow and knee point-blank. Not to mention, you'd literally have to shoot the enchanted fists to be able to make Origin Bullet to work to negate the spell. Second, Kuzuki can **PUT DOWN servants**, not on par with servants. Before Saber could see Kuzuki's fist, **she literally got bodied**, and if it wasn't for Caster she'd be dead, and Saber is anything but average servant. Actually, avalon wouldn't work if your head is crushed, and Kuzuki can punch your head clean off in one hit, this is shown in a bad end, against Rin no less, who is a disciple of Kirei. Shirou remained comatose for a whole night for a hole only in the stomach. What if Kiritsugu were to remain comatose for a night after being hit? Like I've said, bullets aren't a threat when you're at servant level. **Before Kirei got ambushed from behind by Kiritsugu, Kirei wasn't even hit by a bullet even once**. And again, Kiritsugu only dodged the first strike from Kirei because he could see it coming barely, but still took a fatal blow the second time. **He wouldn't even be able to see Kuzuki's fist** which would be faster and invisible, let alone dodge it. Not to mention Kuzuki's fist has much longer range than Kirei's, when Saber stepped back from Kuzuki and thought she is safe, Kuzuki hit Saber directly in the abdorman."")

-------------------------------

Shirou's distortion makes him reckless, but most of his actions have meaning. It's pretty doublestandard if you think it's different as Kiritsugu didn't pulled off anything less risky really. As to treating Rin, that's the difference in morals between people then, I guess. Rin could save another person, Shirou wants to defend them both. He knew that Rin isn't a bad person and not a threat to humanity, and he doesn't want to kill a good person. Whether Rin tried to hurt Shirou isn't important to that. Archer nearly killed Shirou, and Shirou isn't even angry about it. **It's impossible for Shirou to get mad about someone doing something to himself, he only snaps when something happens to someone else**, that is his distortion. Actually, in the VN it wasn't exaggerated to the anime's levels, the only thing close would be the Broken Phantasm, but after that Shirou was quickly carried away by Rin and Saber.

Sure, Luffy gets wild and reckless, but he's no fool when the stakes are high. It's more than luck and determination that has taken him so far. 

He's incredibly flexible in combat (har-har), tailoring his approach to his opponent's precise weakness(es). Maybe not right away (i.e. it took a second go to beat Crocodile, but it was through cunning and besides, Luffy was relatively inexperienced then), but I'd say he never relies solely on bludgeoning his opponents when the shit hits the fan.

And even if that were the case, Luffy's mastery of Kenbunshoku Haki gives him precognition and Busoshoku Haki makes him near invulnerable. He hammered through the goddamn Ark using the latter Haki and Gear 3rd.

"cmd9ru0","1.  Ishtars are considered to be an overpowered PVP doctrine at the moment for a variety of reasons.  Part of it is they are incredibly mobile, kitey ships who can basically drop a bunch of damage-dealing drones (sentries) in space, and then 'run away' from those drones.  They are kind of a pain in the ass to counter although it can definitely be done.

2. Incursions are one of the best ways in-game of making a lot of isk in a relatively safe manner.  There is very little risk to you if you are running with a competent incursion community.  Also, incursion communities are known to be constantly full of drama and stupid infighting. They are also generally an adorable bunch of elitist pricks (&lt;3 ISN), and will laugh at newbies who want to join up and make isk, because they require exceptionally shiny ships and fittings in order for you to get invited to their fleets. (exceptions are newb friendly communities like Warp To Me.  They're a bunch of fedora-wearing neckbeards though :D )

3. Some people feel that these incredibly powerful ships should never have been added to the game.  CCP originally figured that they would be extremely rare in-game, and would not have a huge effect on gameplay.  CCP was so damned wrong, and supercapital proliferation is a huge balance issue in the game, one that they have recently tried to correct by adding in the Jump Fatigue mechanic.  It's designed to make it more risky to commit supercaps to a fight, and to reduce the ability of large alliances to project their force over great distances in a relatively short amount of time.  It's still anyone's guess whether this feature is actually working that way. 

4. POS (player-owned starbases, structures that you anchor near a moon to do things like manufacturing and moon mining) code hasn't been updated since very early in the game's history.  The interface is unwieldy, incredibly buggy, and doesn't really fit in well with the way that the game's lore and general UI 'feeling' has been changing over the past 6 or 7 years.  It's rumoured that the people who originally wrote the code left CCP on bad terms and didn't bother to properly document how the whole system worked, and apparently CCP can't figure out how to overhaul it without breaking all the things.

5. I have never really been in a sov-holding alliance (well, I guess I'm kind of affiliated with one now... but fuck that shit WAFFLES is young and reckless), but the general consensus is that null-sec sovereignty mechanics are FUCKING BROKEN. Sov is basically the mechanism by which alliances claim systems as their own.  It involves a lot of structure grinding - shooting at structures in space with lots and lots of hit points - and is apparently incredibly boring to do. The system also makes it a lot easier for large alliances to hold lots of space, and makes it really hard for the little guys, smaller alliances with fewer pilots, to actually get a toehold in nullsec.

He's a wonderful person. He's hard working, charismatic, romantic, generous, an all around great guy. Of course he's not perfect, but you get the point. He's got so much going for him in life right now; he's got a good job, great relationships with his friends and family, he's saving up to buy a house, thinking of going to school soon, his life is looking like a roller coaster that only goes up. 

I, on the other hand, am a drug addict and an alcoholic. I am sick in the head. My mother loathes me, his family disapproves of me, and I'm doing absolutely terribly in school. Im at rock bottom right now and I don't want to drag him down here with me. He knows all this, he knows about my substance abuse problems, but he doesn't know the extent. He sees me when I'm high or drunk or angry/psychotic because I'm not, he's seen me at some really low points. But he doesn't get mad, he doesn't break up with me, he just bottles up his emotions towards me and tells me it'll be okay. I love him to death. I know he loves me too, but I can't continue going out with him, it's not fair to him. He tends to not take my problems as seriously as they should be taken, which I think is only because he's scared to. That breaks my heart and I don't want to put him through any of this anymore. I'm trash. He deserves so much better. 

Also, he treats our relationship like I'm sure anybody else would treat theirs. He wants to go on dates and go out with people and make plans about the future and talk about our lives together, etc etc. But I can't! I can't picture my future more than a month in advance because I just don't know what's going to happen. I have colossally fucked up so much in so little time in my life that I'm terrified to promise anything to him because I just don't know that I can keep it. He thinks I'm just young and reckless but truly I think I've messed up a lot for the long run. 

I need to fix myself before I can have a relationship with *anybody*. I want to take some time and figure out how I'm going to fix the supreme shit storm that is my life, and the stress of hiding my problems from him is too much. It keeps me up at night thinking about him dreaming of us having a life together, it makes me so sad. 

We started this relationship way too fast, as well. I was his first everything and he sort of fell head over heels. I love him too, but I've always had issues with commitment. It's just too much too fast and I can't keep up with his life in the state I'm in. He's gonna go far and I need to get back on my feet still.

"cm91gbt","Reposting mine from the last time we had an unpopular opinion thread...
How's this for an unpopular opinion? Steroids and other performance-enhancing drugs should basically just be allowed in boxing.

I am well aware that boxing isn't like, say, cycling because grown men are hitting each other in the face with fists. It's hugely dangerous and added strength just ups that danger. I am well aware of the incentive this gives to young fighters to destroy their own bodies in pursuit of athletic success. If a competitive athlete thinks the edge he needs is some drug, he's going to take it more often than not.
But hear me out on why I think this way.

First of all, tons of performance-enhancers are already legal. Ibuprofen helps reduce swelling and inflammation and speed up recovery: totally legal. Vitamins and other nutritional supplements help balance a fighter's diet, boost energy, etc: totally legal. Hyperbaric chambers help oxygenate the blood, which helps repair muscle damage: totally legal. At some level, isn't just about every training method, every food, every exercise a ""performance enhancer?"" Where do we draw the line between stuff that's OK for someone to take and what's not? We tolerate plenty of unnatural substances and unnatural methods in boxing already.

As something of a side note on this point, why is testosterone-replacement therapy allowed but testosterone-enhancement not allowed? If a guy like Lamont Peterson has naturally low testosterone, why isn't the answer ""Tough shit, try being an accountant"" instead of ""Oh, well, we'll allow you to take a specified amount of testosterone so that you'll get boosted up to a 'normal' level.""?

Second, I believe that use of PEDs is already rampant in the sport and that there's no real way to ever stay ahead of the game as far as testing methods. The stuff we can test for is yesterday's news as far as the state of the art goes, and even when we do test, it's often shady how it's performed or tainted by athletic commission and promoter bullshit. You could theoretically have every fighter get 24/7/365 random blood and urine testing, but even then you can't test for a lot of stuff that guys use.

I know this sounds dangerous and reckless, but what is boxing if not a dangerous and reckless sport? Fighters go into it knowing the dangers. Some of that is getting hit in the face, obviously, but some of the physical danger in the sport just comes with the sacrifices necessary to stay in shape and train. Starvation, dehydration, overtraining, torn muscles, hand injuries, broken bones, lost teeth, etc. We're fine with all of that AND we're fine with them getting smashed in the face for 12 rounds for our entertainment, but not if they used some drug to help them along the way?

So if use of PEDs is rampant, if testing for and enforcing rules against using PEDs is practically difficult or impossible, and if there's no clear line as to what an allowable PED/method is and what's off-limits, why exactly are we doing what we're doing now with this half-ass shit that's barely even enforced when a positive test does come up? I'll retire to my downvote bunker now.

And some extra thoughts from the rest of that exchange...

The fact that we can't police it properly actually is sort of an argument for legalizing PEDs, just like we legalized alcohol in the U.S. when we figured out we couldn't police it properly. If rules exist, they have to be enforced clearly or they'll be ignored and then you'll just have lawlessness.

I don't buy the whole ""supplements are natural"" thing. Walk into a GNC and tell me the shit on those shelves is totally natural and not a problem. Sure, lots of it is fine, but the fact that there's a store packed with powders and pills that boxers are busily cramming down their throats for a performance advantage doesn't exactly scream ""natural"" to me. And when a bunch of guys test positive and CLAIM that it was just some off-the-shelf thing from a supplement store, it doesn't scream natural to me.

I'm not enough of an expert to know the negative effects of every steroid, but what I've heard is that some of the most damaging drugs are not things people use today and some of the stuff people do use today isn't nearly as dangerous as we were led to believe in high school.

I don't think PED usage would necessarily harm the sport. Look at baseball; they raked in more cash than they knew what to do with during their steroid era with home run races and all. Not saying that would happen in boxing, just saying it's not clear that it'd be positive or negative in terms of the business.

Most PEDs aren't actually illegal drugs but instead are prescription-only.

Have you looked at the Temperaments? You're evenly split between NF and SP so I'm wondering if you have checked out the values that each temperament holds. I'm gonna quote some Keirsey here, but he describes SPs (the Dionysian) as thus: 

""At the bottom, the Dionysian SP must be free; he will not be tied or bound or confined or obligated. To do as he wishes *when* he wishes, that's the ideal"" (Please Understand Me, 31).

Keirsey then goes on to paint a picture of a very in-the-moment type of person. He says SPs love tools and are more prone to working with their hands and acting on plans rather than actually planning. Not to say they aren't cerebral, as when they are in the moment they can be the smartest person in the room (I have been shown up by many SPs when it comes to common sense or putting pieces together). SPs are the epitome of the free spirit. 

Alternatively, Keirsey describes NFs (The Apollonian) in the same book as:

 ""The NF's 'truest' self is the self in search of itself, or in other words, his purpose in life is to have a purpose in life"" (58).

""Where SPs are drawn to the performing arts, the NFs are drawn to the arts which involve verbal and written communication"" (63).

"" The NF has an extraordinary capability to appear to his beholder to be whatever the beholder wants to see"" (63).

So according to Keirsey, SPs and NFs can have somewhat conflicting life goals: where the SP wants to be eternally free and able to act on his impulses, the NF must be guided by the desire to grow and become the ""ideal"" version of himself.",1416175178,"see, the way i play is like how you play at first; reckless but interested in seeing how the other plays.","reckless but interested","reckless","but",FALSE,"reckless but interested","interested",NA,NA,1

Can you really see Archer living with that?

Hall was several meters away from the closest police officer when the shots began. He posed very little threat to the officers as he was armed with a small pocket knife and could have easily been brought down with a taser.

Six Saginaw police officers fired 47 times at the 49-year-old Hall, striking him 11 times. Police claim Hall acted aggressively, according to then-Saginaw County Prosecutor Michael D. Thomas.

The video was obtained by the ACLU from the family of Hall. It provides a more detailed depiction of the incident that day than the original cellphone footage.

According to the Huffington Post, the ACLU presented the police dashboard footage to representatives of the Organization of American States on Monday in an attempt to pressure the federal government to take another look at Hall’s death.

The shooting was “not only reckless, but clearly unjust, and also grossly violated Milton Hall’s human right to life,” Fancher said.

"ckmwuic","Grom from WCIII wasn't really like that. Yes, he was bloodthirsty and reckless, but he showed several times that he lamented the use of demon blood more than he did the power it gave. He also didn't needlessly go to slaughter Cenarius out of sport; it was self defense. That mission even began with the orcs getting absolutely hammered after the Night Elves, who had tried to slaughter the orcs without first attempting peaceful contact, failed. Lastly, killing Mannoroth wasn't really self defense. The orcs at large could of gone on with life, ignoring the blood curse as they had done. But after Jaina and Thrall free Grom's mind, the two orcs actively hunt Mannoroth down.

I agree that Grom is the bigger badass if it's just a question of killing things while Bolvar is the bigger badass in a sense of being a paragon, but Thrall really didn't lie about Grom. He just emphasized the wrong parts of his story when telling Garrosh.

"ckjf5q2","Let_there_be_light, you are here in this lifetime to learn the lessons of responsibility. Coming into this life with a freedom-loving and rebellious nature, you rail against all limitations. Thus, it is your nature to avoid responsibility. However it is precisely the duty and accountability derived from the acceptance of responsibility that will fulfil your destiny and lead you to a true sense of independence. You may have a kind of manic fear of being dominated or controlled by others - you must learn not only to free yourself from such control but to realise that ongoing negative reaction to authority is itself a form of being controlled. Having no reaction at all to authority may be the real freedom for you. This path calls for you not only to throw off the yoke of self-imposed fear of restriction but also to give birth to an inner sense of responsibility through discipline. Your core lesson is to know that fighting limitations is in itself a form of limitation. Your goal is to develop self-control and discipline through the acceptance of responsibility, using your gifts of discipline, profundity, and devotion to achieve success and happiness.

Your challenge in life is dealing with conflict. The way to solve it is to be assertive without being aggressive. Assertiveness skills, such as standing up for yourself, can be learned. Be prepared to take risks. If you have weighed up the pros and cons, taking a calculated risk is not reckless but essential to increase your chances of luck.

There is something quite feline about you; like a cat - you can be devoted and available one moment, independent and elusive the next. Although you can be sociable and are likely an extremely attractive individual, few will get to know you very well; even getting to close to you is no guarantee that you will commit in any way. So strong is your need for absolute freedom that you will often change your mind or heart at the last moment, leaving those around you feeling confused. Although this unpredictability adds to the attractive air of mystery you create around yourself, part of the reason you tend to vanish or isolate yourself from time to time is that you tend to have a low stress threshold, feeling that the best way for you to deal with conflict is to withdraw and reflect in private. Problems, however, can arise when the need to withdraw and regroup becomes a need to hide or escape; you need to learn that conflict, although unpleasant, is essential for your psychological growth.

Until the age of thirty-four, you will be presented with many opportunities to develop your friendly and sociable side and you should take advantage of these because, left to your own devices, you run the risk of being over-serious in your approach to life. After the age of thirty-five, there will be a turning point in your life that brings an emphasis on a deep emotional need for change, intensity and personal power. During these years, your powers of concentration are likely to be exceptional and, when you find a cause that is worthy of you, your absolute devotion to it will attract incredible success and fulfillment your way. Throughout your life, however, as long as you make sure that you don’t become so devoted or absorbed in your work or thoughts that you lose a sense of direction or your own identity, you as a highly advanced and unusual individual will find your own unique way to contribute new knowledge and insight to the world.

Love: You are highly sensitive and, when you are hurt, your natural reaction is to seek solace in books, ideas or your work. This stifles your emotional growth and you need to put your creative energy into reaching out and connecting with others instead. Sure, you may get hurt but, until you can take that risk and put your heart on the line, you will feel lonely and misunderstood.

Health: You are prone to negativity and this can affect both your physical and emotional health. You may, for example, be prone to fatigue, headaches or sudden mood changes. You need to understand that, although people and situations do not change, what can change is your outlook. Digestive disorders and minor ailments could also be a problem and, instead of soldiering on regardless, it is important for you to seek medical advice. As far as diet is concerned, you need to learn to recognize when you are hungry for food and when you are hungry for attention, affection or stimulation. Regular moderate to mild exercise such as brisk walking is recommended, as are relaxing therapies such as aromatherapy, yoga and acupuncture. Wearing the colour yellow will encourage you to believe more in yourself, and wearing red will help you to feel more assertive.

Career: You have a natural affinity for writing, music and art, and you may become a  spectacular film-maker. You may also be attracted to scientific careers or to careers that benefit humanity as a whole. Other work choices may include research, statistics, accountancy, business, management, administration, law, law enforcement, psychology, publishing, and medicine.

Your mission is to learn to deal with conflict in a positive way. Once you have learned to face rather than run away from challenges, your destiny is to contribute knowledge that benefits or inspires humanity.

2014 for you is a year of introspection and reflection, a time to analyze your thoughts and actions, and pursue studies of an intellectual or metaphysical nature that interest you. During this year, you may want to explore life's deeper truths, either looking into philosophical matters or studying natural sciences. You will find yourself better able to solve problems, and come to a greater awareness of your full potential. Let things come to you in 2014, as this is a year when amazing thoughts and ideas can materialize. It is a good year to carry out plans that don't require involvement from others, and a year to guard your personal ""alone"" time, so as to avoid feeling irritable. A time to get ""centered"", you may find that at times during this year you feel lonely and left out. The main lesson is to learn to be alone without being lonely. By the end of this year, you will likely be in a position to handle life with greater insight and efficiency.

2015 is a great year for goal setting and career attainment. It is also a year for business and material matters. Because it is a year of personal prosperity, you are in a position to manifest whatever it is that you want in life. It is also a year to reap the rewards of previous efforts, as well as a time to give some time, money, and energy to philanthropic pursuits. This year will find you dealing with important people, important decisions, and important methods of operating, rather than being bogged down in petty details. Force, energy, and power are at your command during this year, although you are asked to use it wisely and with the intention of achieving the highest good of all those around you. Set your own direction and participate fully in the process.

Good luck!

Sharelle

They say you always remember where you were when it happened, and it's true. I remember that night more clearly than just about anything else. She had soft red curls and was wearing a dark blue sleeveless dress with off-center buttons and...I guess you'd call it a slouch collar. It was a loose tube of fabric around the neck that made me want to go exploring. She was stunning. I was amazed. I'd never have picked her out for myself in a crowd. I mean, I'm not bad looking, but I'm certainly more interesting than handsome. I wasn't totally sure she was real, and until she said my name I refused to believe she was there to meet me. I felt like a slob in my best suit.

From other women, I'd feel intimidated and close up on them. I would go on the defensive, and a date would only go downhill from there. She had a quirky, genuine smile, however. It wasn't a smile meant to convey anything other than what she was feeling. She giggled like a child, wild and reckless, but was very deliberate in her thoughts. She was assertive and witty. I remember one moment while she was in the bathroom- I was struggling not to fall in love. It's too soon, I said. It's only the first date.

We traded numbers and a kiss- deeper than I expected, but it left me hungry. We promised to speak again soon. The next day they reinstated the draft, and my number was pulled, first round pick.

The next 6 years were full of blood and fire. They're beginning to bleed together, and I don't miss the clarity. Its amazing how much you can lose in 6 years, and I'd rather remember other things. I remember Blaze, the only other member of my unit to survive, the only one more highly decorated, and the one that pulled my bacon  out of the fire during that final offensive. He's an old, tired dog, and he's earned more than his share of naps. I remember coming back to green plants and running water you could drink. I remember the first patch of strawberries I grew with my own hands. And today, as a caravan pssed through, I found another good thing to remember- that first sight of Stevie as she jumped off the bus.

Her bright green eye sparkled all the more for the one she'd lost, and she made a fashion statement out of an eyepatch. Her smile, unbelievably, was utterly undimmed- the very same one she'd favored me with a decade ago. And she remembered me, too.

"ck7elti","Two cars changing lanes to get into the same lane--whether there is a merge or not--is always one of the most dangerous things that can happen on a highway.

The brake checking thing was ridiculously stupid and reckless, but aside from that I would also put more of the blame on that same driver who was changing lanes to his right.

I see the same issue a lot on the 401 exit northbound to the 404.  It's a merge from the left side and the drivers frequently want to get over to the right side to exit at Finch or Steeles.

"cjrj8ph","I too opposed God from the ages of 14-19, particularly Christianity. From 19-20, I didn't care that much, and was content with my passiveness towards religion and spirituality. So, to an extent, I can see where you're coming from. 

&gt;I feel like I can't believe, but I want to. My brain, what feels like logic used from my atheist days, refuses to let me believe.

I don't think this has anything to do with the association of atheism and logic, nor does it have to do with being an atheist. This vast abstraction of 'God' is supposedly contained within a book, and I think it's difficult to believe, and it most likely is innate in most. Obviously, I can't speak on behalf of other people, but for me, I too struggle to understand God or have the ability to just 'belief'. But there is this string that has allowed me to grapple with the concept of God, and that is Christ.

**How do you know your god is the right one?**

This is a good question. Imagine if there was only peace and harmony. Anything good within that Universe will pale in contrast to all the other goodness. In other words, goodness becomes a lot less special. In reality, we unfortunately don't live in a world where it is completely good. We have to deal with famine, pain, anguish, and carnal desires - it is an integral part of life, and for some, life can be a lot worse than for others. Now, how will goodness appear in this unfair world? Just as much as a dehydrated adventurer cherishes the thought of encountering an oasis in the desert, how sweet will that ""goodness"" taste when surrounded by harshness.

Of course, we're dealing with an incredibly subjective topic: what is this ""goodness"" and is this ""goodness"" even necessary? For me, as a Christian, I believe this goodness to be the Trinity. It is the narrative of Christ, all the way from the incarnation to the crucifixion, that encourages me to believe. Here's a snippet of this [narrative](http://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/2dffs5/in_light_of_recent_events_an_iraqi_christian_hymn/). Now, to partially answer ""is it necessary?"". Ultimately, mankind generally has an inclination to do good. Disregarding the debate around true altruism (and Ayn Rand's *Atlast Shrugged*), there still is the *desire* to do good. Unfortunately, mankind also has a tendency to fail. The history of mankind highlights the potential that man has for evil, regardless of your self-constructed moral compass. For instance, Nazi Germany. Ordinary folk, just like you and I, ran on to the streets and protested for the complete annihilation of the Jewish people. Incessant genocides, torture, pain, anguish, hurt, lies, and murder were carried out by seemingly normal people. No man is truly all good, history tells us otherwise. In actual fact, I suggest the following study by Philip Zimbardo, *The Lucifer Effect: How Good People Turn Evil*, that discusses this very idea.

Ultimately, we are told to be Christians, and to be in Christ. No, not to simply be human. That isn't good enough. To be human, and to express humanity, is to accept both the bad and good of what it means to be human. To be a Christian is to be exclusively good. We are told by Christ to refrain from violence, and to retaliate evilness with love and mercy. The strength of Christ is to not be arbitrary, but to be purely good. 

The revolutionary narrative of Christ is unique, but of course, this is my opinion. Christ led a particular way: not a life of words, but a life full of tangible substance. He was to teach, and to philosophise, and to act on what was philosophised. For Christ said ""Greater love has no one than this: to lay down one's life for one's friends."" and not only was it said, it was done. No, He did not mean it in the most metaphorical sense, as in to partially dedicate your life for another. No, He meant it in the most harshest term: to sacrifice your whole entire life for another. And He did just that: the innocent and pure revolutionary, mutilated and nailed to the Cross. The Lord of all Lords, brutalised and hung on the Cross to die as a spectacle for His own creation! You see, the Lord, before his dying seconds, could have expressed obscenities towards those who committed such injustice. Yet, we do not see the foul but only the beautiful, and as proclaimed by the Lord ""Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing"" - mercy is the Edenic outcome; mercy is God's only outcome. Am I wrong for falling in love with this narrative more so than Rand's or Nietzsche's work? I know pain too well, and so do many. However, the pain in Iraq is ubiquitous and what gives me hope is Christ. What gives me the endurance to continue loving my enemy is Christ: no, not my inner-self - I'm way too arbitrary and reckless. But it is Christ who Has taught me to repress my hatred for the sake of love. This is the revolution of Christ.

**How do we know Jesus rose from the dead??**

We have faith in the narrative that is told. We have faith in the outcome. It's difficult to swallow, and it's something I also have trouble with. 

**Are religion and science compatible?**

I hope so, otherwise my whole life would be rather contradictory. The splitting between the two is unnecessary, and tends to be a problem in the US because of the rise of fundamentalism. I have committed myself to both God and to my medical career, and I don't feel conflicted. If you want further information on this topic, then this site is [brilliant](http://biologos.org/). 

**Could I still be forgiven for all of my sins?**

Do you desire to be forgiven, and do you wish to also forgive others?

**What are the differences between many of the sects?**

This is a massive topic. Is there anything in particular you would like to discuss?

I don't think I can convince you, nor can anyone else. Ultimately, it rests on you.

"cjm6374","See, here's the other thing about a therapist...they aren't so much to help you detect the trans (only you can do that) but to help you with everything else.

If you are struggling to come out, you could benefit from a therapist.
If you are struggling to tell your Mom you're on hormones, you could benefit from a therapist.
If you can't explain to your parents why this is so urgent you're DIYing, you could benefit from a therapist. 
If you're DIYing because of any fear that you might otherwise not get what you need through your parents or an endo, you can benefit from a therapist.

Therapists can do a lot of different things for you, but too many trans people who haven't worked with one (or who have only worked with bad ones) think that their role is to be gatekeepers who decide whether you're trans. That is not at *all* my experience. They're there to help you communicate with all the cis people who don't understand and navigate the trials and tribulations of a cisgender world that isn't set up for you or your needs. The most important thing my therapist helped me with was dealing with my 70 year old mom and 75 year old Dad (who is a terminal cancer patient...so you can imagine...)

There are legitimate good reasons to not see a therapist, to DIY, or to avoid communicating openly with your parents, and I can't say whether those apply to you (though from what little you've said, it seems like this isn't the case, and that it might be time to see a therapist, work with an endo, and have real talk with the parents). 

But what to do now? I would be up front. You're going to have to use your own words, but here are important points *I* would make (but I'm not you).:

1. You're sorry that you've freaked them out, and that this must feel like a breech of trust. You know it's better to be open about these things, but this is the hardest thing you've ever had to face, and, frankly, talking openly about this with your parents is terrifying. 

2. You're sorry you haven't told your Dad yet. Lots and lots of trans women have more trouble telling their male parental role model than anyone else. It's just really, really hard, because you love your parents so much, and you want them to love you, and you fear how they will take it, because so many parents aren't supportive, and because our society says so many horrible things about trans people. You also know that the news can be painful, and it's hard to hurt those you love. It shouldn't hurt, but you know it often does.

3. You know that you said you were going to see a therapist before starting the hormones...you've heard so many bad stories about therapists, you know in your mind and heart what you need and want, and who you are, and there is an urgency with hormones. The longer you wait, the harder a life you will have, because they become less and less effective. You get why this seems impulsive and reckless, but it's more because the road through a therapist is frightening, hard, and slow, while your body is changing under you.

"cjjt695","The people of the Mottoman Empire are outraged to hear this news from the north. Like a mad mob, the people swarm the streets, rounding up any Cvar citizen/traveler they can find, burning them alive. 

When word of these atrocities reaches Azula, she says nothing. Her council however, squabble and bicker like dogs:

Councilman Cenk shouts *""WAR! The Mottomans MUST respond to this blasphemy by showing its superior strength and power! We will flatten those barbaric savages in a matter of months! With our combined-""* 

Councilman Ediz interrupts *""An entire clan, are you mad!? Yes, we do have superior strength, numbers and technology but the toll it would have on our people after the war would cripple us!""*

Councilman Ediz *""Only after the deaths of thousands of people, THAT is NOT victory!""* 

Councilman Direnc *""The people's purpose is to DIE for the Empire. WAR IS THE ONLY LOGICAL RESPONSE AFTER THIS BLATANT INSULT!""*

Councilman Erkin *""It's also suicide! You forget the Cvar's are in an alliance with Nisovkia, who in turn is allied with Dacia! And our relations with the Dacians is poor at best after our attempt to exploit their civil war.""* 

Councilman Cenk *""And who's idea was that? You stupid bastard! You seem also obvious to the fact that we are in the Aegean Alliance with Sparta, Liguria, Egypt and Carthage! With our combined strength, we could accomplish anything!""* 

Councilman Erkin *""You are all exacerbating the situation! The chieftains actions do not a reflect Efyt's true motives! He is young and reckless, but I'm sure he wants war less than WE do.""* 

Councilman Cenk rises and screams *""WE 'DO' WANT WAR!""*
 
Councilman Fusun *""Sit down you imbecile! You embarrass us all. Though reluctantly, Erkin, I must disagree with you... That chieftains head would be rotting on a spike right now if Efyt genuinely wanted to maintain peace between us. After the blatant disrespect, we would have the Cvar's begging for forgiveness at our doorstep...  But, I'm sad to say, I can't see any of those filthy horsemen begging. Efyt may not want to insult us, but he certainly has no problem letting other people do it for him.""*

Councilman Erkin *""Perhaps you are right... But what about here? In our streets. What about our people? Burning Cvar innocents?""*

Councilman Cenk *""Let them! The more horsemen dead before the fighting starts the better!""*

Councilman Fusun *""The people will listen to our Empress, we will send out guards to settle the people down. Efyt is the real problem we have though.""*

Councilman Ediz *""Please understand! Efyt is new to his throne, and will-""* 

Councilman Direnc *""Stop saying that trivial name, 'Efyt'? Its laughable, what an 'inspirational' title for a leader! I feel sorry for the poor bastards! FOR ALL I CARE, 'EFYT' CAN GO SUCK HIS DEAD FATHERS COC-""*  

Empress Azula *""Enough.""* 

Azula gives her council a cold stare, and a dead silence fills the chamber. After a minute of uneasy stillness, Azula rises and speaks *""Everyone save Berbat, out.""*

After everyone leaves, Azula speaks to Berbat *""Believe me, I have considered war. But I envisage a more... sophisticated and devious response. I have a new task for your Kan Hirisizlarini. The Cvars will bleed, slowly and painfully. Let the inferior decay.""*

Later that day, the Empress spoke to the people, asking them to calm. Ensuring them, that the actions of one drunk chief do not reflect the actions of the new Khans. Guards were sent out to return order and spread Azula's word. Slaves cleaned up the streets and charred remains of poor victims. That night. Envoys were sent to the leaders of Liguria, Sparta, Egypt, Carthage and Zairia. As well as this, a pack of cloaked figures were seen heading North-East. Peace returns to the Empire.

Finally, Azula sends an envoy to Efyt, acknowledging his ascension and welcoming him as a leader. However, she demands that the chieftain who committed the atrocities by naming condemned prisoners after her, be punished accordingly... or the positive relationship between the Cvars and Mottomans that has been built up over centuries, will end.

As for DE: HR, Jensen tries to justify the reasons he picks a particular ending, but we have been immersed in the debate surrounding all these different factions throughout the series and if you point to any part of the game, the debate augmentations vs pure, will invariably surface. The stock footage was lazy, but it reinforces the themes much more significantly than ME 3 does by pointing out not only the failings or benefits of the ending, but BOTH the benefits and failings( Illuminati ending shows need for order, protests and violence, but also shows Jensen questioning whether leaders are really wise enough to be trusted with images of police states and Tony Blair and connotations of the Iraq war. No one dominating figure ever insists only their ending is right). The original ME 3 endings on the other hand were for an entire trilogy, and finished not on the repercussions for the galaxy, but on your squad getting trapped on a remote planet and all forms of transportation eliminated in the galaxy. It made no sense. 

 The same is not true of ME 3, and if it is , the biggest plothole is the fact that the synthetics v organics conflict is apparently stopped by synthetics murdering all organics(the Reapers aren't just 'storing them', a good deal of organics are literally just blasted out of existence in a good old fashioned genocide). 

The free will component was emphasized throughout ME 1, from the radical Geth who were disciplined but excessively devoted, to the disparity between the rigorous rules and regulations of C-Sec to the dangerous freedom but just nature of the Spectres, even to the Biotic implants which caused severe repercussions. The debate was much more subtle though than DA II and ME 3 which had to dilute it into easy to identify 'Templar v mages' and 'synthetics v organics' debates.

"ciy70cq","Reposting mine from the last time we had an unpopular opinion thread...

How's this for an unpopular opinion? Steroids and other performance-enhancing drugs should basically just be allowed in boxing.

I am well aware that boxing isn't like, say, cycling because grown men are hitting each other in the face with fists. It's hugely dangerous and added strength just ups that danger. I am well aware of the incentive this gives to young fighters to destroy their own bodies in pursuit of athletic success. If a competitive athlete thinks the edge he needs is some drug, he's going to take it more often than not.

But hear me out on why I think this way.

First of all, tons of performance-enhancers are already legal. Ibuprofen helps reduce swelling and inflammation and speed up recovery: totally legal. Vitamins and other nutritional supplements help balance a fighter's diet, boost energy, etc: totally legal. Hyperbaric chambers help oxygenate the blood, which helps repair muscle damage: totally legal.
At some level, isn't just about every training method, every food, every exercise a ""performance enhancer?"" Where do we draw the line between stuff that's OK for someone to take and what's not? We tolerate plenty of unnatural substances and unnatural methods in boxing already.

As something of a side note on this point, why is testosterone-replacement therapy allowed but testosterone-enhancement not allowed? If a guy like Lamont Peterson has naturally low testosterone, why isn't the answer ""Tough shit, try being an accountant"" instead of ""Oh, well, we'll allow you to take a specified amount of testosterone so that you'll get boosted up to a 'normal' level.""?

Second, I believe that use of PEDs is already rampant in the sport and that there's no real way to ever stay ahead of the game as far as testing methods. The stuff we can test for is yesterday's news as far as the state of the art goes, and even when we do test, it's often shady how it's performed or tainted by athletic commission and promoter bullshit. You could theoretically have every fighter get 24/7/365 random blood and urine testing, but even then you can't test for a lot of stuff that guys use.

I know this sounds dangerous and reckless, but what is boxing if not a dangerous and reckless sport? Fighters go into it knowing the dangers. Some of that is getting hit in the face, obviously, but some of the physical danger in the sport just comes with the sacrifices necessary to stay in shape and train. Starvation, dehydration, overtraining, torn muscles, hand injuries, broken bones, lost teeth, etc. We're fine with all of that AND we're fine with them getting smashed in the face for 12 rounds for our entertainment, but not if they used some drug to help them along the way?

So if use of PEDs is rampant, if testing for and enforcing rules against using PEDs is practically difficult or impossible, and if there's no clear line as to what an allowable PED/method is and what's off-limits, why exactly are we doing what we're doing now with this half-ass shit that's barely even enforced when a positive test does come up?
I'll retire to my downvote bunker now.

And some extra thoughts from the rest of that exchange...

The fact that we can't police it properly actually is sort of an argument for legalizing PEDs, just like we legalized alcohol in the U.S. when we figured out we couldn't police it properly. If rules exist, they have to be enforced clearly or they'll be ignored and then you'll just have lawlessness.

I don't buy the whole ""supplements are natural"" thing. Walk into a GNC and tell me the shit on those shelves is totally natural and not a problem. Sure, lots of it is fine, but the fact that there's a store packed with powders and pills that boxers are busily cramming down their throats for a performance advantage doesn't exactly scream ""natural"" to me. And when a bunch of guys test positive and CLAIM that it was just some off-the-shelf thing from a supplement store, it doesn't scream natural to me.

I'm not enough of an expert to know the negative effects of every steroid, but what I've heard is that some of the most damaging drugs are not things people use today and some of the stuff people do use today isn't nearly as dangerous as we were led to believe in high school.

I don't think PED usage would necessarily harm the sport. Look at baseball; they raked in more cash than they knew what to do with during their steroid era with home run races and all. Not saying that would happen in boxing, just saying it's not clear that it'd be positive or negative in terms of the business.

Most PEDs aren't actually illegal drugs but instead are prescription-only.

What is the ""easy way"" in boxing, and how do we determine who got it? Doesn't every American/British boxer have a built-in advantage over fighters from third world countries due to nutrition and access to athletic equipment alone? How do we account for those differences?

Perfect Dark: Initial Vector, and Perfect Dark: Second Front by Greg Rucka  are two excellent original novels set between PD Zero and PD. They focus more on the corporate warfare aspect, which is what both games are generally about. It sort of uses PD Zero as a template, borrowing a lot of the feel and settings (as well as basing Jo off her Zero appearance), but has more of a feel of the original game. Plus, Rucka does a very good job at giving Joanna a personality; she comes off as a bit of a rebel, like she does in Zero, very headstrong and reckless, but is also very aware of her skills and abilities. She comes off more as a person without a purpose in life, having gotten pulled into the world of corporate espionage and a chain of command, now that her only family is gone.

The Mass Effect Novels (Revelations, Ascension, Retribution, NOT DECEPTION) are all very good reads. They can get a bit text-dumpy from time to time, but they do a good job at immersing you in the world, tech, and community of the Mass Effect universe. Even better, all the stories (even Deception, unfortunately) tie directly into the games. Kahlee Sanders (from ME 3) is the main character in all 4 books, alongside Anderson and a few other familiar faces.

EDIT: Oh, and the Gears of War series is also fairly well done. I didn't care much for Aspho Fields or The Slab, but the novels in between, detailing the aftermath of sinking Jacinto, the survival of its people, and the emergence of the Lambent, were pretty interesting. Several characters get focused scenes, detailing more about them, and each book usually contains a parallel story via flashback.

Football is technically not a contact sport. With the exception of shoulder-to-shoulder, contact can only be a side-effect. 

It's *hard* to play the game without constantly fouling people, there's always someone between you and the ball. If the ref basically tells you ""you don't need to bother"", players will stop making that effort. First it will be the defenders who will have to let someone get past them if they don't, but pretty soon it's everybody.

Round 1: I'd say Sokka would win. Despite his overwhelming loss to Zuko in episode one, Sokka is a hunter who has been feeding a group of people alone for months. He is untrained and reckless, but in far better physical condition than village kid Usopp.


Round 2: Usopp. Sokka is a pretty decent swordsman, but Usopp's pop green are really, really powerful and he has far superior range. I suppose Sokka could win if he managed to get into close combat, but Usopp could possibly block Sokkas sword with his impact dial (we haven't seen it stop blades in the manga, but it does in the G8 filler)


Round 3: This one is pretty 50/50 I think. I imagine a ""Trying to find and take each other out in a forest""-scenario.

As mentioned Sokka IS a hunter and probably would have the edge in finding Usopp (untill he yells ""sneak attack"").

I looked down at my dash to figure out how many miles I had left, when I realized I'd forgotten to get gas before heading out. I was almost empty, and had about 80 miles to go before I hit the city. I tried my best to coast to the nearest one-horse town, and barely made it into the gas station parking lot. I jumped out, entered my credit card, and... No dice. The gas station closed at 11pm, and it was 11:05. I just stood next to my car for a few minutes, weighing my options. I could sleep in my car, or I could call one of my friends, but they'd have to drive 50 miles to rescue me... Just then I heard a bunch of people talking. There was a bar around the corner, and the last group was leaving for the night. I flagged down a couple as they walked to their car, and explained the situation. They told me to wait there while they ran home and got a gas can. A few minutes later, they came back with a full gas can, and proceeded to fill my tank. The man told me that they had two daughters my age who live on their own far away for school, and he hoped that someone would do the same for them. I was so grateful to have it home that night.

"chospc6","**Christ**

The history of mankind (including the history of Islam) highlights the potential that man has for evil, regardless of your self-constructed moral compass. For instance, Nazi Germany. Ordinary folk, just like you and I, ran on to the streets and protested for the complete annihilation of the Jewish people. Incessant genocides, torture, pain, anguish, hurt, lies, and murder were carried out by seemingly normal people. No man is truly all good, history tells us otherwise. In actual fact, I suggest the following study by Philip Zimbardo, *The Lucifer Effect: How Good People Turn Evil*.

Ultimately, we are told to be Christians, and to be in Christ. No, not to simply be human. That isn't good enough. To be human, and to express humanity, is to accept both the bad and good of what it means to be human. To be a Christian is to be exclusively good. We are told by Christ to refrain from violence, and to retaliate evilness with love and mercy. The strength of Christ is to not be arbitrary, but to be purely good. Hence, I implore a Muslim to bring a verse that has more wisdom than 1 Corinthians 13, or the whole of Matthew 5.

The revolutionary narrative of Christ is unique, but of course, this is my opinion. Christ led a particular way: not a life of words, but a life full of tangible substance. He was to teach, and to philosophise, and to act on what was philosophised. For Christ said ""Greater love has no one than this: to lay down one's life for one's friends."" and not only was it said, it was done. No, He did not mean it in the most metaphorical sense, as in to partially dedicate your life for another. No, He meant it in the most harshest term: to sacrifice your whole entire life for another. And He did just that: the innocent and pure revolutionary, mutilated and nailed to the Cross. The Lord of all Lords, brutalised and hung on the Cross to die as a spectacle for His own creation! You see, the Lord, before his dying seconds, could have expressed obscenities towards those who committed such injustice. Yet, we do not see the foul but only the beautiful, and as proclaimed by the Lord ""Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing"" - mercy is the Edenic outcome; mercy is God's only outcome. Am I wrong for falling in love with this narrative more so than Rand's or Nietzsche's work? I know pain too well, and so do many. However, the pain in Iraq is ubiquitous and what gives me hope is Christ. What gives me the endurance to continue loving my enemy is Christ: no, not my inner-self - I'm way too arbitrary and reckless. But it is Christ who Has taught me to repress my hatred for the sake of love. This is the revolution of Christ.

And finally, St. Isaac the Syriac
&gt;""God the Lord surrendered His own Son to death on the Cross for the fervent love of creation... This was not, however, because He could not redeem us in another way, but so that His surpassing love, manifested hereby, might be a teacher unto us. And by the death of His Only-begotten Son He made us near to Himself. Yea, if He had had anything more precious, He would have given it to us, so that by it our race might be His own. Because of His great love for us it was not His pleasure to do violence to our freedom, although He is able to do so, but He chose that we should draw near to Him by the love of our understanding. For the sake of His love for us and obedience to His Father, Christ joyfully took upon Himself insult and sorrow... In like manner, when the saints become perfect, they all attain to this perfection, and by the superabundant outpouring of their love and compassion upon all men they resemble God’. Therefore the Incarnation took place because of the love of both the Father and of the Son for human beings, and because of the Incarnation a human person is able to attain such a state of love when he becomes godlike.""

Yet, we do not see the foul but only the beautiful, and as proclaimed by the Lord ""Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing"" - mercy is the Edenic outcome; mercy is God's only outcome. Am I wrong for falling in love with this narrative more so than Rand's or Nietzsche's work? I know pain too well, and so do many.

But it is Christ who Has taught me to repress my hatred for the sake of love. This is the revolution of Christ.

And finally, St. Isaac the Syriac
&gt;""God the Lord surrendered His own Son to death on the Cross for the fervent love of creation... This was not, however, because He could not redeem us in another way, but so that His surpassing love, manifested hereby, might be a teacher unto us. And by the death of His Only-begotten Son He made us near to Himself. Yea, if He had had anything more precious, He would have given it to us, so that by it our race might be His own. Because of His great love for us it was not His pleasure to do violence to our freedom, although He is able to do so, but He chose that we should draw near to Him by the love of our understanding. For the sake of His love for us and obedience to His Father, Christ joyfully took upon Himself insult and sorrow... In like manner, when the saints become perfect, they all attain to this perfection, and by the superabundant outpouring of their love and compassion upon all men they resemble God’. Therefore the Incarnation took place because of the love of both the Father and of the Son for human beings, and because of the Incarnation a human person is able to attain such a state of love when he becomes godlike.""

"chc6ofr","It is a matter of experience and the people in the group we have. The game is very streamlined and doesn't take much work to play. So we take every effort to make the game less daunting. We have all the country's bits in a little bowl ready to be handed to the one with controlling interest.

We have a chess clock sort of rule about how long one can take on their turn because the game requires fluency. If a player, familiar with the game mechanics, spends more than about 30 seconds on their turn holding the game up we all vote to force them to give their smallest investment tile back from the country they are controlling.  It means that a player will learn to play fast and leave their phone on silent to avoid a coup. An inexperienced player will play quick and reckless but learn a lot by doing that. An experienced player has no problem forming a strategy quickly enough to make it happen without 30 second do-nothing delays. We also consider negotiation to be part of play, so nobody starts the coup if players are negotiating over areas and swinging deals. It is rare that there is a coup any more because players are comfortable with the speed of the game. 

It is only a daunting game when you are playing with people that think about a move for five minutes. That wastes time and rarely results in better strategy. The daunting part of the game is feeling like you are going to make a mistake when surrounded by experienced players. So we play with people that are okay living fast and making some mistakes.

Then we finish the game by discussing it over pizza. When played fast the game is fresh in everyone's mind. The whole game played like this takes max 90 minutes.

"ch5pns7","&gt; You seem to be aware of the flaw in Reddit's nature as a whole, yet demand something contrary anyway? 

I understand the flaw of Reddit in that it cannot exist like other communities exist. Reddit has its flaws but it has its strengths as well. It's not going to be useful for long-term static discussions, but it also means we can more readily bring up ideas that would have been more quickly abandoned on a forum, anyway. If someone posts an interesting thought, and something new is discovered in the comments, it can later be posted again with the new idea to see what else we can get out of it. Reddit has an ""episodic"" format, and one that is much faster paced than any forum. 

&gt;Would that be something that would help toward fixing the problem, do you feel?

No, as you said, that's swimming upstream, basically. Trying to work around the very nature of Reddit is not going to yield interesting or successful results - linked, static posts are definitely useful for some things, but it would get overlooked for something like discussion. 

Something episodic in nature would work best. These regular threads don't need to be *as* regular as being on a schedule. If they're forced, then they'll die off anyway. Keep poss going so long as people are interested in them. 

&gt;who are not yet aware or experienced enough to have a meaningful opinion on such matters? 

Now this I have an issue with. The community is not littered with people who all have their nats invite, certainly. But we also are not a collection of kids who watch the show and play with a starter or structure deck and got a tin because look at the cool red dragon on it. There's enough knowledge in the community to facilitate advancement and basic development, as well as room for the occasional more competitive posts. 

&gt;What efforts would you want taken to see an improvement in the subreddit?

If I were to suggest a single thing to help the sub, as far as changing something about the sub and not the community? Honestly? I know a lot of people complained when YGOBinders split off the trading community, but frankly, I think we should have something like YGOMemes (or something with a less stupid title, I clearly didn't put much effort into that) and funnel off the humor posts. Looking at the top posts of the month, if we cut out everything that could be put into a humor sub (not a meta-humor sub like YugiJerk) we have some card alts/extensions, a cosplay pic (which could probably go in that other sub but isn't necessary), a collection post coming from the community's curiosity, news posts, the occasional discussion post... pulls posts I'm not a huge fan of, but the community decided they're acceptable. 

The issue is that the most popular threads are often not really about Yugioh, they're some joke around it. Some are more appropriate, game related jokes, others are anime or pop culture references. But the issue remains - we have a large number of posts that someone can just look at, chuckle slightly, upvote, and move on. It's not just their existence, it's that they get in the way of other threads. 

I think the removal of the downvote button had good intentions. I think that having it next to humor posts is self-defeating. If that stuff is shifted off to the side, so that we seem less like a ""themed /r/funny"" sub, then it's a lot more helpful. /r/atheism for example, was absolutely cluttered with memes and other junk. The day I decided to unsub from them and take them off my feed and quick-bar was the day that someone posted a picture of a young Neil DeGrasse Tyson labeled ""Isn't he dreamy?"" Eventually there was a change in staff, removing power from a less laissez faire administration and giving it to some members of the community that were more interested in seeing the sub gain some legitimacy and concern itself with its intended subject matter (hey, we did the hard part already!). 

There's certainly no reason for this community to not be friendly, casual, relaxed, etc. I explicitly avoid the joke posts, and I still encounter relevant humor, and community behavior. I have nothing against those sorts of (joke) posts, I just don't think they would do well to mesh with stuff actually about the game. 

And maybe making YGOfunny isn't the way to go about this. Maybe it's necessary that we make an entirely different sub for discussion. God knows how many silent voters we have that would be less inclined to follow us. This I have more objection to, however. If it comes to pass, I'll gladly participate in the discussion sub, and maybe glance at the main page, but I would basically treat it as I treat the default subs now. Something amusing to glance at, but not something I bother to spend time on (with one exception, AskReddit). 

&gt;so it did serve some useful purpose!

Oh, certainly. Unpopular opinions is great because it's a place that people *actually voice their opinions.* And I'll admit, I was a bit mad and bitter when I said that, I was just trying to punctuate the end of the post for emphasis. But the issue with a thread like this is that you simply drop your opinion, maybe add a bit of reasoning, and leave it alone. I've responded to a few people who had an opinion that I felt was misguided, for example some people's attitude towards Upstart and Reckless, but I have no quarrel with people who have legitimately different opinions than I do, like preferring the OCG list or what archetypes are enjoyable.

The owners and the money man at the club don't really care how the team is doing, hence the commercial deals and even the appointment of Ed Woodward as chief excutive, if they cared they would have gone for a football man rather than a Wall Street guy. Other ethos the club have held dear over the years and that's questionably lacking at the moment include; attack minded football, bringing joy to the crowd at old Trafford, a winning mentality, humility, comradrie, and even welcoming people into the club and preaching the gospel that's Man Utd to new fans.
Now the team and largely the manager are dividing opinions among the supporters and the ethos are slowly but surely being destroyed by the people running the club who put their interests above that of the club. 

I have been supporting the club since that famous night at Barcenola, but some people may say, oh! You are glory hunter! I didn't even know who Manchester United was, the tickets were sold as English team vs German team because the cinemas started showing football at '98 WC to drum up more business. Before that, only rich people used to have premium channels at their homes. I remember walking to a crowded hall with two 15 inch screens and could only see things when the camera zoomed into players or replays. I picked up the team with the red shirt and my friend picked the other team. They scored first and my friend was teasing me for it, Bayern was on the ascendency and every time they threatened, people cheered and I thought we must be losing with too many goals. At Half time, a lot of people left because it was getting late and some were bored and thought they came to watch a movie rather than a football match. I got a nice slot at the front where I could see the action very well, and at the end of the match I left the cinema saying I should watch that team more often. Suffice to say, I have followed the team through thick and thin, people may say how? The team has been successful all those time. I got beaten, robbed, shot at and even went to watch my team at the height of civil war in my native Somalia, of course it's easy if you beat the fear and learn to navigate the town easily. In the early 2000's, me and another friend, who I should say passed away, used to go to the games and we used to watch it at the cinema owner's house, rather than the cinema because of the insecurity and people rarely came to watch the games. I was young, stupid and sometimes reckless but that was my formative years of following and learning about the team. I have followed the team ever since, and I'm proud to say I'm more knowledgeable than a lot of fans, went through a lot for my team but that doesn't mean I'm more a fan than say a person who lives 10 yards from Old Trafford who has nothing to do in his weekends than watch the team, or a person from Japan who will pay a lot of money to come to Old Trafford to just have a picture with Kagawa, or an American fan who goes to Old Trafford to see the real thing, the real grass, the real atmosphere, crowd moaning for more, SAF looking at his watch and ordering his troops for one more, Roy Keane tackling, Giggs running the ball at speed, Becks free kicks, Scholes passing, Cantona adjusting his collar. These are images I have in my mind but will never see in my lifetime. My point is this, everyone has his reasons for following the team, whether these are idealistic, superficial, practical or even logical isn't up to anyone to judge, including SAF. The fans has obligation to the club and the club has an obligation to the team, fans, and even to the wider world. As I see it, the club and especially the manager isn't meeting these obligations and the fans are obliged to demand more; asking for better performance, asking for change in leadership, change in team members and even change of how the club is run. If some fans are not informed, myopic and at worst in denial, this shouldn't stop me or anyone doing their obligation to the club. When Barcenola say more than a club, and Liverpool say You will never walk alone, all I say is, the best team in the world. Some people think that's practically impossible, I say why not aspire to that motto. Some people are content with 7th place or worse a draw with Fulham, but such people shouldn't sprout that bs to those who see the club in higher regard. I'm afraid to inform Moyes I wouldn't be convinced to lower my standards, just as much as he wouldn't convince the Queen to forego her crown for a pension in fucking Sulfolk or Crotexth where Rooney is currently not planning to retire to. 

This is a slow morning for me, and I wanted to get that off my chest.

"cgcyf7t","The problem, as I see it, 

(meaning, please disagree if you have more knowledge than me and that's not really hard) 

Is that the league can either allow ""enforcers"" in order to stop the opposing team from targeting star players (moore vs naslund - one was a nobody who was never going to be anything but a nobody) 

OR 

the league has to use some measure of discretion to make it clear that the are taking steps to protect star players because their team mates cannot. 

What the league has done is outlaw option 1 and totally abdicate option 2. 

Additionally, the league has also decided to be ridiculously inconsistent in supplemental discipline rulings - either you base your punishment on the action, or you base your punishment on the result - 

If you are punishing the result: 
Break a guys neck/back - legal or not, get punished (Chara breaks pacioretty's neck - no discipline), boychuk breaks Mason Raymonds back in a complete intentional injury (no discipline) 

If you are punishing the action then we would see automatic and known suspensions (supplemental discipline) for dirty hits that result in no injury - doesn't happen.

Here's what he post said:

&gt; At times I can be a fair bit unstable and reckless, but I'm not ""a fucking idiot"" as half+ of /r/bitcoin[1] [1] would probably respond, right before they downvoted. I don't know why I'm even posting anything, to be honest. I guess discovering the impetus to tell at least part of your story is natural at this point.
&gt; 
&gt; My first BitInstant transaction to MtGox was exactly one year ago today, 2/28/2013. 4 of them, $480.05 each into my Gox acct. How poignant it was to wake up to the news (not that it was wholly unexpected). Kind of funny to think of my mindset at the time, now. It's like...I wasn't totally wrong, but I guess I was wrong enough. I ended up spending just shy of $40,000 over the month of March last year.
&gt; 
&gt; I have a thousand and two thoughts right now. The primary thought being that all I have to my name now are some shares of CaVirtex, some shares of N&amp;B, some peercoins, and a couple thousand dollars. Primary or not, I suppose my thoughts don't matter at this point.
&gt; It was a fun ride, though. I had more fun and genuine engagement over the last year with the Bitcoin community than I have had with basically anything else in my life during that time. It's funny, I knew I was facing a $250k+ loss the other day, but I was so excited about the few hundred dollars I made on N&amp;B, lol. The totals are just numbers on the screen. It's about the trade, and the rapid amalgamation of various sources of data. It's about the extrinsic, objective gratification of knowing whether you were right, or wrong, as told through the market. It's about going against yourself, weighing your odds. It's about striving for perfection, knowing you will never reach it...this market is the best game I've ever played. For all the caustic denigration traders still receive in the larger Bitcoin community, I'll state that greed is not at all about wanting more than you have. Greed is wanting more than you need. It's a differentiation that, I think, is quite overlooked. I do have a mighty thorn in my paw about how the community handled all of this, but it's not worth it to address that now.
&gt; 
&gt; Like any breakdown, there is blame to go around, and I certainly hold a good part of it when it comes to my current predicament. I still believe in Bitcoin. If I had any money left to reinvest, I...might. I knew the risk I was taking (I thought), and I even considered losses down to 50%. I considered near-100% losses as a result of my own market decisions. I did not consider 100% losses as a result of trading on the oldest BTC exchange in existence, and so my fatal flaw was a catastrophic underestimation of my counterparty risk, plain and simple. I made the best decisions I could make at the time, with the information and personal experience that I had to reference in making them. I accept the decisions that have been made. Again, there is certainly a lot of blame to go around, but I respect myself too much to wholly blame anybody else for what was ultimately my decision. I guess I feel worse for my dog than I do myself.
&gt; Life is just a game, cryptofriends. I lose.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; My favorite thing about this song is that in my mind it can represent both despair and convicted hope. I think there's a lot of both in the community right now.
&gt; Cloudkicker - Dysphoria

&gt; 
&gt; But my apologies, again, my thoughts don't matter anymore. Down with the ship it is. It has been a true pleasure, and an honor to be a part of all of this. This community in particular, in my mind, shines well above /r/Bitcoin[2] [2] and a good portion of bitcointalk. Enjoy your weekend, cryptraders. May the light from your candles never fade.

"cga42zp","&gt;Say I open with Elder + [!Asceticism of the Six Samurai] or Kagemusha+Kageki (with ROTA+3 Smoke this isn't hard)

You're right. Getting the monsters you need in the deck is relatively easy. With 4 searcher spells and 3 Asceticisms it's really easy to get almost any synchro you want first turn.

&gt;+1/2[!Six Samurai United)+1/2 [!Gateway of the Six], I proceed to ""vomit"" my hand onto the field

This is where everything starts to fall apart. You are already counting on drawing into 4-ish cards (two monsters or searcher spells, at least 1 united and at least 1 gateway). But now you have to keep in mind you can't thin the deck until you've drawn everything, so in order to get Gateway/United/Asceticism, you HAVE to draw into it. In addition, you also have to keep in mind that Gateway is banned now, so assuming you're playing the proper formats, you have an approximately 0% chance of drawing it, ever.

&gt;Shi En+Naturia Beast+Barkion

If you are going first, you are going to need 6 cards to make this happen: 3 Asceticisms, 1 Kagemusha, 1 Kageki, 1 Kizan. Since only 1 of these three monsters is run in 3's (even now), you're probably going to be using any search cards to grab the missing ones, or hoping to draw them with United.

&gt;Shi En+Shock Master +1/2 face down cards(including Matagama)+1/2 Gateway

You are aware that Gateway was limited before Shockmaster was released, so this is a field that never happened, right? This is the second time you've talked about multiple gateways, I had to go check and see if it was still banned.

&gt;The counter manipulation with United &amp; Gateway is what really gives this deck amazing spam power, each of your summon leads to more searching/drawing due to these two cards.

This is correct. It doesn't HAVE this power anymore, though. Also, there's only so much drawing the deck does. 6 draws off United, but then you lose the ""every summon is a search"" power of gateway if you utilize more than two of those draws, unless you've got dojo but pfft. It might have more if you run Upstart and Reckless, but one of those takes a turn to use.

&gt;Only Ruler with Reju/Prophecy with Judgement can beat LSS in Search &amp; Draw power.

What. In searching, maybe. Gateway had the potential to be use an unlimited number of times per turn so long as you had counters to pay, and with two cards that could hold counters, every summon was a search. In draw power, you're crazy. Six Sams biggest weakness has always been they lose their hand to make their big scary plays. They've got a potential for drawing 6, 9 if you run upstart, 12 with Reckless (but that costs a turn that you might not be able to afford). However, if you want more than 2 of those United draws, you'd better have a dojo or something else that can gather counters off summons to keep their searching power, assuming you lucked out and got 2 of that unsearchable spell. For an off the top of my head example, compare that to something like Darkworlds, with 3 Dealings, 3 Dragged Down, 3 Gates, 3 Broww, and 3 Upstarts, and 3 Reckless. 9 of those 18 draw cards being searchable off the 3 Snoww, and this doesn't even take into account the formats where they had Card Destruction and Morphing Jar, which were during several of the different formats you used in your reasoning.",1395616460,"it might have more if you run upstart and reckless, but one of those takes a turn to use.  &gt;only ruler with reju/prophecy with judgement can beat lss in search &amp; draw power.","upstart and reckless","reckless",NA,FALSE,"upstart and reckless","upstart",NA,NA,0

I made the best decisions I could make at the time, with the information and personal experience that I had to reference in making them. I accept the decisions that have been made.

I don't know why I'm even posting anything, to be honest. I guess discovering the impetus to tell at least part of your story is natural at this point.

My first BitInstant transaction to MtGox was exactly one year ago today, 2/28/2013. 4 of them, $480.05 each into my Gox acct. How poignant it was to wake up to the news (not that it was wholly unexpected). Kind of funny to think of my mindset at the time, now. It's like...I wasn't totally wrong, but I guess I was wrong enough. I ended up spending just shy of $40,000 over the month of March last year.

I have a thousand and two thoughts right now. The primary thought being that all I have to my name now are some shares of CaVirtex, some shares of N&amp;B, some peercoins, and a couple thousand dollars. Primary or not, I suppose my thoughts don't matter at this point.

It was a fun ride, though. I had more fun and genuine engagement over the last year with the Bitcoin community than I have had with basically anything else in my life during that time.

And in regard to your edit: I do believe the standards have dropped when it comes to both committing and calling a foul. And this video not only suggests that the standard has dropped, but reinforces it. But I will not discuss that here.


In the video you can visibly see that there was enough contact on Ronaldo's knee region to throw him off balance--but was there enough force causing him to inevitably fall down? I would think not; however he goes down anyway. And as I implied in an earlier comment, I believe Ronaldo went down easily.

The fact of the matter is that Ronaldo was challenged from *behind*, and in the box, the challenge was not only reckless, but unnecessary. The defender was not only incredibly far away from the ball when attempting the tackle, but he was also unable to even have the ability to bump shoulders with Ronaldo; that's how far he was. The defender comes flying from behind and clips his knee without reaching the ball or completing a clean tackle. To me, and many others, is a foul.


I would also like to clarify that by no means am I labeling this a stone wall penalty, because Ronaldo could have stayed up if he wanted to, which brings up a controversial point: how much of a foul does a foul need to be in order to draw it? Surely fouls range from extreme to mild, and in this case it is very mild, but it is definitely able to be drawn as a penalty. I don't condone this type of 'soft penalty', but if you cannot see why this was a penalty then I am terribly sorry for you, especially because I just laid out why it was--even if it was a soft penalty.

High speed requires very high skill. Small errors are massively compounded by speed: a minor swerve to stay in the lane at 60mph is nothing; at the speed in your video, even a high-performance vehicle could easily lose control. Perhaps more importantly, kinetic energy (for all intents and purposes, the destructive force in a crash), increases with the *square* of the speed; a crash at the speed in your video will be *thirteen times more destructive* than one at 60mph (standard US highway speed).

"cezvuoj","I remember when I was a non tolerant guy, took 4mg of xanax and went to high school, I just sat in the corner of the classroom the whole day and nodded in and out.  When people would talk to me I would just slur my words and respond.  I don't remember much of it other than, I let some kid use my iphone which I would never do sober, I nodded a lot and look/sounded completely wasted.  The teacher took my into the other room and told me not to come to school fucked up, I said I don't know what you're talking about like a tard hahahaha.  10/10 would repeat if I was still in high school and if I could still take even 10mg of xanax and get as fucked up as I did off 4mg when I wasn't tolerant.  Nowadays I can hardly get fucked up off benzos without going to pretty extreme doses.  Except diazepam, I can always get feeling amazing off 10mg diazepam even with a benzo addiction/big tolerance.  Something about diazepam is just magical and it works wonder for me!  I should try to taper though!  

Anyway most times I've drank with benzos I didn't black out because I am extremely tolerant to benzos and I am a big guy, but I can see how dangerous it is and how scary it can be to think your CNS will shut down.  I have always enjoyed my times drinking with benzos, but I quit drinking for the most part nowadays.  Occasionally at a family event I will drink 6+ beers on top of like 5mg etizolam to forget my family exists because I really am not a huge fan of most of them and I really hate talking to them about my future and shit.  Ok family member I don't know what I'm going to do in the future, stop asking every time I see you kthxbye I'm drunk!  I usually end up nodding out on the downstairs couch that all of my family members seem to have in their houses haha.

One time I took an unrecalable amount of diazepam and etizolam on top of drinking while hanging out with my brother and friends.  They got the bright idea to go to a strip club.  We knew of a store that sold nitrous nearby and it was closed and I am not 21 so the strip club didn't let me in.  The only things I remember from that night are how dissapointed I was we couldn't get some nitrous to do and how little I wanted to even go to a strip club because I think they are a waste of money.  Oh also some dude bought be a dank ass gyro and it was the tastiest fucking thing ever.  Damn I was so fucked up.  10/10 would not recommend because it was dangerous and reckless, but I had a FUCKING blast.  If someone without my tolerance tried this they would have blacked out probably off the benzos alone.  I had a lot of diazepam and etizolam on me at the time and even gave a few out to my buddies who had a blast!\

Also one time I mixed 4.8 grams of gabapentin with about 4mg of etizolam.  It was like being completely shitfaced only much more euphoric.  I nodded in and out most of the day, went to my friends house to hang out and ended up passing out a few times and being woken up.  Most of that day was spent nodding in and out of sleep haha.  10/10 would not recommend because it is probably really dangerous, but I had a FUCKING blast.

"cew4ac6","I'm not going to write an entire essay back but there's a lot of holes in your reasoning here.

There's totally room for error. That's how you learn. It seems like you think people who start out are inherently ignorant and reckless, but that's not the case. When you start driving a car you don't speed everywhere. You take it slow, just as someone learning to ride in the city would.

Massachusetts has a specific statute that says cyclists can pass cars on the right, so the truck was still in the wrong even if the cyclist was negligent. You can't blame him for believing that traffic should yield to him as they are lawfully required to do.

If you're excessively cautious of EVERY possible danger as you suggest, that's when you get into accidents. When you're too busy looking to your right to avoid getting doored, you might not notice another cyclist passing on your left. When you're too busy checking behind you to make sure cars don't come too close to you, you'll miss the car stopped short ahead.

There's a level of trust and faith that you need to have when you're on a roadway in a car or on a bike. If you believe everything's going to go wrong then it probably will. You learn that trust by actually riding, not observing.

100% responsibility? How am I supposed to know the car without a blinker next to me is going to turn right into me? How am I supposed to  know a pedestrian is going to walk between SUV's into the bike lane?

In your ""once"" logic, no one should jaywalk because one person getting killed because they didn't look should be enough reasoning for people to wait 30 seconds at an empty road for a cross signal.

Listen, I appreciate the essay but you clearly do not ride a bike and it sounds like you think that no one should ride a bike in the city unless they have urban riding experience (which is completely illogical and backwards). 

Your opinions do not matter as much as those of those who are actually riding bikes with traffic because you are a reader and an observer, not a participant who actually knows what it's like to ride a bike in Boston.",1390416478,"it seems like you think people who start out are inherently ignorant and reckless, but that's not the case.","ignorant and reckless","reckless",NA,FALSE,"inherently ignorant and reckless","ignorant",NA,"inherently",0
"ceuuu6r","How's this for an unpopular opinion? Steroids and other performance-enhancing drugs should basically just be allowed in boxing.

I am well aware that boxing isn't like, say, cycling because grown men are hitting each other in the face with fists. It's hugely dangerous and added strength just ups that danger. I am well aware of the incentive this gives to young fighters to destroy their own bodies in pursuit of athletic success. If a competitive athlete thinks the edge he needs is some drug, he's going to take it more often than not.

But hear me out on why I think this way.

First of all, tons of performance-enhancers are already legal. Ibuprofen helps reduce swelling and inflammation and speed up recovery: totally legal. Vitamins and other nutritional supplements help balance a fighter's diet, boost energy, etc: totally legal. Hyperbaric chambers help oxygenate the blood, which helps repair muscle damage: totally legal.

At some level, isn't just about every training method, every food, every exercise a ""performance enhancer?"" Where do we draw the line between stuff that's OK for someone to take and what's not? We tolerate plenty of unnatural substances and unnatural methods in boxing already.

As something of a side note on this point, why is testosterone-*replacement* therapy allowed but testosterone-*enhancement* not allowed? If a guy like Lamont Peterson has naturally low testosterone, why isn't the answer ""Tough shit, try being an accountant"" instead of ""Oh, well, we'll allow you to take a specified amount of testosterone so that you'll get boosted up to a 'normal' level.""?

Second, I believe that use of PEDs is already rampant in the sport and that there's no real way to ever stay ahead of the game as far as testing methods. The stuff we can test for is yesterday's news as far as the state of the art goes, and even when we do test, it's often shady how it's performed or tainted by athletic commission and promoter bullshit. You could theoretically have every fighter get 24/7/365 random blood and urine testing, but even then you can't test for a lot of stuff that guys use.

I know this sounds dangerous and reckless, but what is boxing if not a dangerous and reckless sport? Fighters go into it knowing the dangers. Some of that is getting hit in the face, obviously, but some of the physical danger in the sport just comes with the sacrifices necessary to stay in shape and train. Starvation, dehydration, overtraining, torn muscles, hand injuries, broken bones, lost teeth, etc. We're fine with all of that AND we're fine with them getting smashed in the face for 12 rounds for our entertainment, but not if they used some drug to help them along the way?

So if use of PEDs is rampant, if testing for and enforcing rules against using PEDs is practically difficult or impossible, and if there's no clear line as to what an allowable PED/method is and what's off-limits, why exactly are we doing what we're doing now with this half-ass shit that's barely even enforced when a positive test does come up?

"cepxzm7","To quote G.K. Chesterton (by way of [Megan Mcardle](http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2011/05/finding-good-drugs-is-harder-than-it-sounds/239408/)):

&gt;In the matter of reforming things, as distinct from deforming them, there is one plain and simple principle; a principle which will probably be called a paradox. There exists in such a case a certain institution or law; let us say, for the sake of simplicity, a fence or gate erected across a road. The more modern type of reformer goes gaily up to it and says, ""I don't see the use of this; let us clear it away."" To which the more intelligent type of reformer will do well to answer: ""If you don't see the use of it, I certainly won't let you clear it away. Go away and think. Then, when you can come back and tell me that you do see the use of it, I may allow you to destroy it.""

Institutions, especially modern ones, are enormously complicated in their own rights, and the ways in which they interact with each other and with society as a whole are incomprehensible to any individual.  Changing them even slightly is an enormous undertaking, virtually guaranteed to come with all sorts of unforeseen consequences.

As a programmer, I like to think of government as a gigantic, life-or-death piece of software, with hundreds of millions of daily users and countless critical systems.  When somebody wants to make a major change, what I hear is, ""Hey, in an ideal world, this particular system would work differently, so why don't we tear it out and replace it with something completely different?  I've checked my code repeatedly, and I know it's bug free and more efficient than the existing system.""  Frequently the people suggesting this don't even understand why the system was created the way it was, let alone what effects it has on the broader institutional ecosystem.  If they turn out to be wrong about the details of their new idea (and if you've ever written code, you know the first attempt at implementing even simple systems is always broken), people suffer and possibly die.

Note that Chesterton distinguishes between ""reforming"" and ""deforming""; that is, completely replacing an existing institution is foolish and reckless, but carefully tweaking an institution to introduce incremental improvements can be a viable approach, if the expected returns are positive and the changes are reversible.  Tradition isn't fixed, but it does have a lot of inertia.",1389763934,"note that chesterton distinguishes between ""reforming"" and ""deforming""; that is, completely replacing an existing institution is foolish and reckless, but carefully tweaking an institution to introduce incremental improvements can be a viable approach, if the expected returns are positive and the changes are reversible.","foolish and reckless","reckless",NA,FALSE,"foolish and reckless","foolish",NA,NA,0

"cel2am2","Poland was due to political acquiescence.  If Germany abided by the unfair Versailles treaty, Hitler and Nazi Germany would've not been a superior military force.  Hitler secretly (at first) began rebuilding Germany's military and then claimed it was a deterring force.  The UK and France were supposed to immediately go to war with Germany if Germany became aggressive, which it did during the invasion of Poland (or the re-arming the Rhineland).  Instead, the Allies balked and offered no support to Poland.

Part of this was due to the uneasy atmosphere in Asia and Europe.  Hitler had Allied with several great powers, including Italy, Soviets, and (sort of) Spain, along a few, lesser others.  Hitler played this uneasy political environment off the nations out of fear of another world war (which hadn't yet started).  The Allies didn't want to engage in another massive conflict, so Hitler took Poland.

The invasion of France, on the other hand, was not really political, but just a move of sheer force.  It was an all out campaign, realistically and strategically reckless, but so swift and without restraint it paid off incredibly well.  

Plus, Hitler previously annexed Austria (Anschluss), which gave Germany a huge boost in numbers and material. Germany grew unexpectedly ( to the rest of the world) and rapidly from this.  Germany's threat was assessed as Germany's capability.  The rapid expansion of land; Poland and Austria, was a shock to the Western Allies and gave Germany a nearly instantaneous massive increase to their war capabilities before the WORLD war had begun.

It was a shocking move, a wise move by Hitler, and arguably a strategically brilliant move.

But back to what we're saying.  This move was brilliant and major, but it wasn't militarily based, it wasn't about out maneuvering another military force.  It was a shocking grab at power and resources before any opposing force could react.  Most importantly, there was no ""enemy"" (aside from an militarily inferior Poland) when Hitler did this.  This event was the first move of World War II.  There was no preemptive move to counter Hitler because before this, there was peace...

Georgia was the aggressor.

Russia stepped in to prevent ethnic cleansing and possible genocide.

Originally BBC, now in Liveleak:

BBC has discovered evidence that Georgia committed war crimes

The BBC has discovered evidence that Georgia may have committed war crimes in its attack on its breakaway region of South Ossetia in August.

Eyewitnesses have described how its tanks fired directly into an apartment block, and how civilians were shot at as they tried to escape the fighting.

Research by the international investigative organisation Human Rights Watch also points to indiscriminate use of force by the Georgian military, and the possible deliberate targeting of civilians.

Indiscriminate use of force is a violation of the Geneva Conventions, and serious violations are considered to be war crimes.

The allegations are now raising concerns among Georgia's supporters in the West.

British Foreign Secretary David Miliband has told the BBC the attack on South Ossetia was ""reckless"".

He said he had raised the issue of possible Georgian war crimes with the government in Tbilisi.

The evidence was gathered by the BBC on the first unrestricted visit to South Ossetia by a foreign news organisation since the conflict.

Georgia's attempt to re-conquer the territory triggered a Russian invasion and the most serious crisis in relations between the Kremlin and the West since the Cold War.

Eye-witness account
Georgy Tadtayev, a 21-year-old dental student, was one of the Ossetian civilians killed during the fighting.

His mother, Taya Sitnik, 45, a college lecturer, told the BBC he bled to death in her arms on the morning of 9 August after a fragment from a Georgian tank shell hit him in the throat as they were both sheltering from artillery fire in the basement of her block of flats.

Mrs Sitnik said she subsequently saw the tank positioned a few metres from the building, firing shells into every floor.

Extensive damage to the five-storey block appeared consistent with her version of events.

She said she and her son were watching television when the Georgian attack began.

""They started firing not from rifles, but from heavy weapons. Shells were exploding.""

""We jumped up straight away, switched off the lights and ran down to the cellar.""

""And we sat here on boxes. We thought it would end, but the firing got heavier and heavier,"" she added.

""They went on firing all the next day without stopping. At some point there was a pause, and we saw Georgian soldiers going along the street in their Nato uniforms,"" according to Mrs Sitnik.

""Then they started firing again, even more heavily. The Grad rockets were coming over all the time.""

""How can you trust those people now? What possible friendship can there be? Let them all be cursed, cursed for the deaths of our children.""

Neighbours said another resident of the block, Khazbi Gagloyev, also died of wounds received during the attacks.

Basements targeted
The Russian prosecutor's office is investigating more than 300 possible cases of civilians killed by the Georgian military.

Some of those may be Ossetian paramilitaries, but Human Rights Watch believes the figure of 300-400 civilians is a ""useful starting point"".

That would represent more than 1% of the population of Tskhinvali - the equivalent of 70,000 deaths in London.

Allison Gill, director of the Moscow office of Human Rights Watch, said: ""We're very concerned at the use of indiscriminate force by the Georgian military in Tskhinvali.

""Tskhinvali is a densely populated city and as such military action needs to be very careful that it doesn't endanger civilians.""

""We know that in the early stages there were tank attacks and Grad rockets used by Georgian forces,"" she added.

""Grad rockets cannot be used in densely populated areas because they cannot be precisely targeted, and as such they are inherently indiscriminate.

""Our researchers were on the ground in Tskhinvali as early as 12 August.

""And we gained evidence and witness testimony of Grad rocket attacks and tank attacks on apartment buildings, including tank attacks that shot at the basement level.

""And basements are typically areas where civilians will hide for their own protection.

""So all of this points to the misuse, the inappropriate use of force by Georgia against civilian targets,"" according to Alison Gill.

Human Rights Watch will talk only of the ""possible"" deliberate targeting by Georgian forces of individual civilians, a still more serious charge, though some Ossetians the BBC spoke to in Tskhinvali claim to have witnessed such cases.

Wreckage
Marina Kochieva, a doctor at Tskhinvali's main hospital, says she herself was targeted by a Georgian tank as she and three relatives were trying to escape by car from the town on the night of 9 August.

She says the tank fired on her car and two other vehicles, forcing them to crash into a ditch.

The firing continued as she and her companions lay on the ground.

She showed the BBC the burnt-out wreckage of the car on the town's ring-road, riddled with bullet holes and with a much larger hole, apparently from a tank round, in the front passenger door.

Ms Kochieva says a nurse from her hospital was killed while fleeing Tskhinvali in similar circumstances.

She says she counted 18 burnt-out cars on the ring-road on 13 August, at the end of the war, suggesting there may have been more casualties.

Asked if, at night, Georgian soldiers might not have suspected her car of carrying Ossetian fighters, Ms Kochieva said: ""Fighters wouldn't have gone away from town, they would have gone towards town. We were escaping like other refugees.

""The Georgians knew this was the 'Road of Life' for Ossetians. They were sitting here waiting to kill us,"" she said.

Georgia's Foreign Minister Eka Tkeshelashvili told the BBC, ""I can firmly say that the Georgian military, on intention, never attacked directly any civilian object.

""On the surface, the damage to some of the houses in Tskhinvali that can be observed might lead to this conclusion. But to see if some is damage inflicted by direct targeting, for that an in-depth military assessment needs to be done.

""I think the best response is a fully-fledged independent, impartial international inquiry into the issue,"" she added.

Her British counterpart David Miliband, who visited Georgia immediately after the war to show solidarity with its government, said he took the allegations of war crimes ""extremely seriously"" and had raised them ""at the highest level"" in Tbilisi.

Apparently hardening his language towards Georgia, he called its actions ""reckless"".

But he added: ""The Russian response was reckless and wrong"".

Revenge
The BBC saw evidence of the cycle of revenge since the war, with the demolition of most houses in the former ethnic Georgian villages on the northern outskirts of Tskhinvali.

The houses, whose occupants fled during the war to other parts of Georgia, were burnt by Ossetians immediately after the fighting.

They are now expected to be replaced by a brand-new housing complex with a cinema and sports facilities to be financed by the city of Moscow.

Zaur Gagloyev, a 20-year-old former law student, now unemployed, claimed he was one of those responsible for the burning.

""There were so many provocations in these villages by Georgians,"" he said.

""For example, they were taking Ossetians as hostages and that's why I feel so angry.""

Mr Gagloyev added: ""If you want an advice on how to burn a house, just set light to a curtain and the whole house will catch fire.""

Asked if he was guilty of ethnic cleansing, he replied, ""No, it wasn't ethnic cleansing.

""No-one was killed there. We just let them go from our land. I don't know whether they will return or not,"" he added.

""But I did everything I could for them not to return. Never.

"cegiedj","Point about Schumacher:

Schumacher was not out of bounds, he was 'off piste'.  Most of Whistler/Blackcomb (in bounds) is 'off piste' with the exact same risks that Schumacher was exposed to.  If you go to Whistler and only ski the groomed runs, you're only skiing about 20% of the terrain that people use in the resort. 

People don't travel 1000's of km's and pay $90+ a ticket just to ski the same kind of groomed snow you can ski for $50 at Cypress or any other small hill.  Without 'off piste' terrain like Schumacher was skiing when he hurt himself, Whistler wouldn't be in business.  Skiing is not a risk free sport and most people know this.

&gt;Go into the back countering doing whatever you want but when you pay money to get taken up a mountain on a ski lift to then disobey the rules that is selfish and stupid.

I'm not sure if this is English but in most cases there is no rule against taking a lift up a hill and then skiing past the boundaries of the resort.  This also happens every day at Whistler without incident.

Danny Brown's bangers are unique because they give you the feeling of going crazy on drugs.

It really gives the fans the whole picture of Danny Brown struggling in Detroit and what partiers think about when they're body is recovering from the abuse of last night and a brain depleted of seratonin.  This side to him feels more like a normal rapper. He still sticks to his eerie, electronic based production but strays from his polarizing high pitched voice to a more normal one.  

I actually have a friend who doesn't listen to much rap, is very into raving, and when he told me he loves side B of 'Old' but never listens to Side A, it completely made sense to me as to why.

"ce702yd","It's often hard to realise the amount of expertise that goes into a performance.

In 2007 when parkour was pretty big, I had the honor of meeting some of the big names at a gathering along with a lot of people who'd been practicing martial arts/gymnastics/tricking/dance for years.

They would balance on rails 5-6 meters above the ground without too much worry. My gut told me that was stupid and reckless, but what I didn't realise was the expertise involved: When I lose balance and fall, I flail my arms, I push off against the object with my legs, and I violently jump off the object. However whenever they were about to fall, they would not flail their arms and legs. They would simply crouch down and grab the rail with their hand. It was an extremely controlled motion. And that's part of what people call ""falling correctly"".

In the other end of the spectrum, I know a guy who injured his elbow joint really bad after a wrong fall. He was exiting a move (a run up a wall), his pace was slow, below walking speed. But he was out of balance because of the move, and he tripped backwards on the grass. He tried to soak the fall with his right arm, stretched out, elbow locked. Bam, injury from tripping backwards. (A correct fall here would be anything from footwork over ""falling into a pushup"", to simply falling on your shoulder)

Whenever one of the artists in the GIF falls, I imagine they just grab the wheel and regain balance. There is no force other than yourself that can push you off the object. And you're not going to push yourself off the object, because you've practiced for years.

As for practicing, I imagine they started out with the wheel standing still, and they climbed on it, learning how to grab it. Then they put it in slow motion, and they grabbed it. When they were comfortable with that, maybe they would try standing up for a second. Then walking, then running, jumping, and so on. You master something, then you dial it up, and you take another step.",1387626061,"my gut told me that was stupid and reckless, but what i didn't realise was the expertise involved: when i lose balance and fall, i flail my arms, i push off against the object with my legs, and i violently jump off the object.","stupid and reckless","reckless",NA,FALSE,"stupid and reckless","stupid",NA,NA,0

Trying not to sound annoyed, I tried to end the conversation here and now:  
""yeah man, I've tried lucid dreaming but to be honest, I should really study for finals. Besides, when are you going to pay me back for the side-view mirror?""

He stutters and stammers as his face suddenly pales, mouthing off something to the effect of 'owing more dangerous people than me' and promises to pay me back as soon as he can. I can see him struggling to make an excuse and not wanting to torment my pal any longer, I tell him to just leave me alone. He smiles and reiterates his promise before bolting out of my apartment. A little financially irresponsible and reckless, but I love him like a brother regardless.

The silence begins to replace Gabe's usual loudness and my mind starts to play around with the idea of dream lucidity. Sure, dreaming is pretty neat by itself, but being aware and being able to control them? That could give me the opportunities that I could never fulfill in reality.

Turns out Gabe was right. It really was great. The first few weeks were interesting, but on the fourth week I achieved a more lucid state of dreaming. I discovered that I now had complete lucidity over my dreams. Complete awareness, clarity, and control. Such great power.

At first, I did the things everyone did. I flew in the sky, experiencing flight like a superhero would. I spun around in circles, watching my setting change right before my eyes. I transformed myself, into an animal, a machine, a superhuman. In my dream state, I was my own god.

Then, I started to dabble in more realistic fantasies. I began to see my ex in my dreams. I let her talk to me, and we would recall all the good and bad in our relationship. I held her for the first time since her death. I dreamed of being successful, owning several sportscars, or diving in stacks of cash. I dreamed of saving people from robberies, muggings, and assaults, effectively becoming a vigilante inside of my dreams. Everything that I did, had no consequence. It was perfect. It was, after all, my own world.

But everything comes at a cost. I traded aspects of my reality to feed my fantasy. My expectations rose above normal, and misfortunes became amplified. I lost my job, and my academics worsened. Several bouts of depression and emotional breakdowns didn't do much to help either. I soon became addicted. I spent at least ten hours sleeping, desperate to return to my dream world. I became a recluse, only leaving my apartment to purchase food and hygiene products.

Then, it all stopped. The lucidity was gone. I developed insomnia and slowly lost sleep in increasing rates. I don't know. All I know is that I feel empty, hollow, and weak when I'm not asleep. My body craved sleep, but was unable to. I felt like a heroin junkie, feeling the need to shoot up another dose to achieve my high.

I don't know where it all went wrong, and I don't know if I ever could have been helped. My life was terrible as is, but I think the lucid dreaming just widened the gap between my expectations and reality. Is lucid dreaming the cause? Or is it merely a part of the process? Are our dreams reality? Is it possible that by achieving a lucid dream, you enter another dimension? I honestly don't know. All I know is that I need to dream.

So, as far as adhering to the central themes of acceptance and who they are, Persona 4 managed this well. Facing the parts of themselves that they were ashamed of was a MAJOR part of not only the story, but ALL of the party members' Social Links. Hanako was looked down upon, not because she was fat, but because she was a horrible person, who not only refused to share food with those who didn't have any, but who also looked down upon everyone. If you think the characters were reduced to single traits, then you might be forgetting a few major points. 

Yosuke, for instance, is generally light-hearted, but he is driven to find the truth because what happened cost him the life of the girl he loved. When he is faced with this fact, as well as a few others, he becomes very serious, and sometime furious, particularly when it comes to WHY these things happened.

Chie seems like a training/meat obsessed person (like Akihiko), but in reality she just wants to protect those important to her. She's jealous of Yukiko, but she still views Yukiko as a close friend. She's afraid of not being able to protect those important to her, or accomplish her goals. While she may come off as tomboyish and brash, there are many instances where she shows a much more vulnerable, unconfident side that doubts herself. Her Social Link addresses her doubts about doing things on her own, as well as some of her jealousy of Yukiko.

Yukiko seems like a very traditional girl who has a weird sense of humor and has laughing fits, but she is actually quite passionate about many things, and, as her Social Link reveals, wants to decide her fate on her own. She may come off as one dimensional, but she has many traits that flesh out her character.

Kanji's not gay, that's pretty much stated. However, because Shadows exaggerate the parts that you're ashamed of, which are the parts Kanji thinks are ""Girly"". His Shadow reflects how uncomfortable he is around girls (Had to look this up.): ""Oh how I hate girls. So arrogant and self-centered. They cry if you get angry, they gossip behind your back, they spread nasty lies... They look at me like some... Some disgusting THING and say that I'm a weirdo... Laughing all the while! 'You like to sew? What a queer! Painting is so not you. But you're a guy... You don't act like a guy... Why aren't you manly...? What does it mean to ""be a guy?"" What does it mean to be ""manly?"" Girls are so scary..... Men are much better.'"" (That was way longer than I thought.) Anyway, Yosuke himself says he understands how Kanji feels. The jokes are just friendly teasing. Kanji's Social Link is about him coming to terms with his skills, and what it means to be a man and be strong. He seems hotheaded and reckless, but sometimes (Like when Nanako ""Dies"") he seems to be the most clearheaded.

Rise may seem like just your flighty girl, but her Social Link  shows that she's had to act so much that she's lost touch with who she really is. She's loyal to her friends and fans, and she cares deeply for others.

Teddie is much like a mix of Yosuke and Rise. He is lighthearted and loyal, but he doesn't know who, or rather, what, he is. He's very friendly and optimistic, but he also feels responsible for some of the tragedies that befall the Investigation Team, and tries to make up for it.

Naoto is an intellectual whose identity doesn't fit her ideal image of who she wants to be. She's observant and driven, but, as her Social Link shows, she forgets herself at times, particularly when it comes to having fun and conversing with others.

Adachi isn't necessarily sexist, he's just a bad person. He murdered two women out of Jealousy. The first one died because he had a thing for her, but she had an affair with Namatame. The second one died because Namatame tried to warn her, but Adachi thought that she was also having an affair with Namatame, so Adachi's jealousy from the previous murder comes into play here as well. Running through Magatsu Inaba reveals that he's also condescending and power hungry. His motivations are expanded upon clearly. He wanted power, and a specific woman, but his jealousy and bitterness towards the world led to the murder of two people, and his eventual influence by Ameno-Sagiri.

The cast became friends because, in one way or another, but mostly because they saw the Shadows, they already know everything about each other, and were willing to accept each other, despite the flaws and nasty things. It never fully touches on Kanji and Naoto because, in my opinion, Atlus wanted to allow you to romance Naoto without making you feel bad for Kanji, which they kind of did to you in 3 with Mitsuru (In my opinion.) In 3, they pretty much made canon relationships, but also MADE you date every girl in the game.

Both themes are incredibly poignant, and I actually can't choose which I prefer. Death is great, but it's been done A LOT. Truth is more unconventional, but may come off as ridiculous.


The issue of Truth is EVERYWHERE in Persona 4, as well as the secondary theme of Facing Yourself. In every Social Link, The person involved is shying away from the truth of their situation, as well as how they really feel. In Persona 3, I felt that the issues in Social Links kind of resolve themselves, and you were just there for the ride. But in 4, you actually talked to, and helped the person realize their problems. Plus, the pacing of the Social Link is better in 4, in my opinion. In 3, it kind of goes like this: ""Hi my name's Maiko, my parents are getting divorced."" But in 4, you get to know them more before they start unloading to you, but you can still tell something is bothering them. The truth is different for many people, the main example being Adachi and You, the MC. Adachi's ""Truth"" is that the world is simple, and a place for the strong to take over and use to their advantage, taking what they want, and if things don't go the way you want, then why not solve the problem however. But your ""Truth"" is much different (I'm assuming something of a personality here.) in that the world and people in it are worth caring for and getting to know, and if things don't go your way, to calmly think of a solution that doesn't involve taking things through force. Namatame is another example. At first, his ""Truth"" seems to be that Saving=Killing. His ""Truth"" is that he's been saving the people he believes to be in danger, mainly because he saves them, and they come out safe and sound. But your version of the ""Truth"" is that he's an insane killer.

These are the same creators from ICO; They give empty space for you to explore. Sometimes there are reasons for you to explore them (items, power ups, special cutscenes, etc.), others, there's not. 

There's something oddly profound and simultaneously eerie about an empty, vast world for you to explore. At first it reminded me a lot of OOT, you know, with exploring it's map...But after a while it was almost like they were trying to make a statement. I think it's because when you take all the fluff out of a game (and by fluff, I loosely use that term), and make the focal point of the game literally from start to finish about it's storyline, you create an almost isolated experience. And I think that's a good way to describe it. Isolated.

From start to finish of the game, that's the theme. Isolation. You're alone. In a world, with Colossus who are found, alone. The only contact that you make with these colossus is to defeat them. And that's profound because of the *reason* for it. It's romantic, and sad, and savage, and worrisome, and reckless. But it's human, isn't it?

The success of ICO also was founded this concept; two people meeting, not understanding how to communicate with each other but through _action_. A young man who's isolated, shunned, and curious constantly saving a captured, weak and misunderstood 'princess' only for the tables to turn at the very last second of the game. 

The game is all very eerie, because it touches on so many human reactions/emotions/concepts that it feels like it's directly speeking to you.

"cddcf9t","As I said, everyone in every sport is going to mess up. Everyone can badly time something. Parkour has huge fundamentals on conditioning yourself and never doing something beyond your reach. A lot of movement is purely instinctual. I've messed up movements before and never seriously injured myself because of the conditioning and training I do.

When you're doing something you're capable of, you take your time and plan it out, and yes, sometimes things still go wrong, but that happens. [This video here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aw9pODOFZEY) is of Toby Segar, one of the most famous traceurs/freerunners around and has been training more than 7 years. Notice how as soon as he realizes something is wrong, he changes his technique and goes into a roll on landing? Sure, momentum helped, but it's his training and instinctual movement from his years of training that pushed him to roll correctly avoiding any further injury. He broke his clavicle and months later is training good as new again.

The idea is that things go wrong. He would've been preparing this movement and getting into the mindset for a long time, and it still went wrong. 

Even professionals fuck things up, if you've never seen a pro skater bail or a gymnast fall on a balancing beam trying something, than you're not paying attention. It's the same with parkour. Something that you're capable of can still go wrong. You wouldn't say a gymnast doesn't care about safety because they weren't wearing full padding when doing something. Sure, they're in a more padded environment, but that's where they learnt. Traceurs learn outside in the real environment because that's where you'll be when a situation would arise where you'd need to apply your training.

**Training with pads or a helmet is the quickest way to get yourself injured. It obstructs your vision, allows you to be careless, stiffens and restricts your movement and causes a distraction. Training like this, like every traceur does is why there are so little injuries, because they take extra care. One of the biggest parts of parkour is taking care of your body and your environment, and remaining safe. You assess a risk. If you're confident with it, not reckless but actually confident and have drilled it, you've lowered the risk. No one is going to just run and dive straight into this without a care or a thought. This is the mindset of parkour and this is what is drilled countless times. This guy in particular had done this movement and has done it since - I used to/might still be subscribed to him (though I believe he has since stopped posting videos as of a year or two ago) and was in no way doing something he wasn't capable of.**",1384353976,"if you're confident with it, not reckless but actually confident and have drilled it, you've lowered the risk.","reckless but actually","reckless","but",FALSE,"reckless but actually confident","confident",NA,"actually",1

Regarding Espeon, she is only 5 points less in power than Alakazam who is crazy powerful. Which is almost as pointless as saying Goku is over 9000, but it does give us an idea of her power. Honestly, the way Pokémon is set up, there's no efficient way to determine any Pokémon's canon ability. So I'm just *hoping* she's as powerful as MM, more likely she's a bit less. At least in numbers, but psychic fights have never been about ""power levels"", it's about will, creativity, powerful emotion.

"cckkeax","**Anarchy in the U.S. of A.**

Whether it's the first immigrants looking for gold or religious freedom, the Founding Fathers and their political motives, or the pioneers fighting nature to build a new home, the U.S. was built by one type of person: the guy who says ""fuck you"" to established norms. Even if we let the government run stuff, we've always been anarchists at heart--we do what we want, to hell with what anyone else thinks or says. Not ""anarchist"" in the usual sense of anti-archist, but anarchist in the sense that even though we have leaders, we live as though we don't. Maybe ""autoarchist"" would be a better word for it--each man is his own king.

With that in mind, let's step right up to today's program.

We'll start with the **catchy**.

[**Art Blakey Quintet - Confirmation** [hard bop] (1954) - [9:11]](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oih-w-wuUZA)

Jazz--maybe America's best original creation in history. It takes the good stuff from everywhere and throws out the traditional expectations. Unlike avant-garde music, though, jazz isn't contrary for the sake of being contrary: it creates its own rules, its own traditions. Once they get old, those can be ransacked and tossed out too. Hard bop, for me, is a great example of this facet of jazz music, especially the venerable Art Blakey. It borrows from bebop, from blues, from gospel--all genres that were themselves syntheses of other stuff. It's fast and reckless, but it doesn't lose sight of what it wants.

Now we'll move right along to the **popular**.

[**Kings of Convenience - Freedom and Its Owner** [acoustic indie pop] (2009) - [3:25]](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlqfP69eJYc)

Who better to tell us about American anarchism than a couple of Norwegian hipsters? In their reincarnated Simon and Garfunkel style they comment on our country's favorite subject: ""But freedom, freedom never greater than its owner / Freedom is the mastery of the known / Freedom, freedom never greater than its owner / No view is wider than the eye"". Unfortunately we're reminded of this a lot on the news--people taking their freedoms and doing less-than-ideal things with them. Like voting to shut down the country instead of finding a compromise. Hey, that's the American way.

And thirdly we'll venture into the **obscure**.

[**Schneider TM - Pac Man / Shopping Cart** [electronic pop] (2006) - [3:46]](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LONjw9o-cK0)

Yet again we look to the northern Europeans for comments on our society. This German guy paints a pretty accurate picture of the downside of personal anarchism. Sure, we can do whatever the hell we want, but that doesn't mean we will. While the pioneers wrestled bears and lived off dirt and locust shells, nowadays we're more likely to just be like the song's subject, who ""went to Walmart to fill his go-kart heart"". Kinda like the quote about birds flying anywhere in the world--what's the point of anarchism if we don't take advantage of it?

And finally, a pair of **bonus** songs.

[**Eyedea &amp; Abilities - ...Powdered Water Too (Part 2)** [rap] (2001) - [3:23]](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ik3UC_fypLQ)

The most political of our selections today. ""I am my enemy, can’t think my way out of this penitentiary / Embrace the condition humanity’s mechanically accepted for centuries / It’s the water, is it real? / How does it make you feel / being endlessly dependent on external crutches and shields?""

[**Deep Purple - Concerto for Group and Orchestra, I. Allegro** [classical / rock] (1969) - [14:58]](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pG1h8FUIDNU)

"ccicskb","&gt;I'm fairly sure the most heinous WMD attacks in human history that were inflicted on two cities that were not primarily military targets with known civilian population and using a weapon that can't differentiate between the two qualifies as horrific.

What a load of bullshit. These were not heinous attacks. The rape of Nanjing was heinous. This was war. In total war, the entire civillian population is part of the war effort, but even if you don't buy that, then at the end of the day only a fool would say that being nuked wasn't better for them than the alternative. How many Japanese civillians would have died if the US was forced to invade the home islands? Low estimates are about a million. High estimates are ten million. How many American soldiers would have died? Low estimates are a quarter million. High estimates were four million. So bombing those two cities saved millions of lives in that war. More to the point, it almost certainly saved tens of millions of lives over the next six decades of peace between the major powers.

&gt;However, when we do finally have another world war, which given a long enough timescale is all but inevitable, we will likely wipe out our entire species, or at the least, take ourselves back to the stone age.

BIOGRAPHY: Hailing from the streets of Washington, D.C., Johnny Jones has always been a rebel. He dropped out of high school Junior year, moved out, and started to live off money he got from performing in hardcore wrestling matches in a hardcore ally-way promotion. He always had to fight to stay alive and believes strongly in the concept of ""Survival of the Fittest"". Johnny said he never had a single friend but himself growing up and that he's lucky that he lives life ""His own man"". Known for his vicious radical opinions on the wrestling industry and putting on very brutal matches, there isn't much innocent about this D.C. born punk. Johnny Jones is very vocal on his anti-social and anti-corporation views and hatred for nearly everyone, especially the fans. He is young, reckless, but very fluid in-ring.

However, Johnny Jones had a change of heart after a very grueling battle at Mt. Doom, causing him to rethink himself. Being an unforgiving friendless bully had got him nowhere. He decided to spend a lot of time thinking about who he was, and who he could be. He then shocked the PWR universe, returning as a completely new man who embraced everyone around him, so long as they didn't start anything with him; otherwise, they got the same side of Johnny as they did before.

"cc6qiuz","You're quite welcome, and thank you for the kind words.  

Like I said I am and really try to focus on what an amazing life I had. I was just short of a genius/child prodigy.  By 4th grade I was a chess master and was selling software I created for several thousands of dollars. If I had only learned to patent software... I never studied in my life but got a 1580 on the SAT, and eased through college being offered a Rhodes Scholarship.  But I turned it down to go fly fighters for the Air Force. My grandfather owned a plane and taught me to fly when I was young.  He and I would go fly to small uncontrolled fields and he would get out, and let me go fly by myself... all at the young age of 12.  It was amazing to be up in the sky free from everything by myself.  I got my license so I could legally fly at 16.  I knew there was nothing I wanted more than to fly the best machines in the world. And I was so fortunate.  I have lots of ""there I was"" stories as I was reckless but extremely intelligent and highly skilled at flying. I got to see the curvature of the earth, fly around the pyramids of Egypt, well over 100 combat missions... Out of everything I excelled in life I never met anyone as talented flying as I was.  (I think learning to fly at such a young age gave me an advantage for life). Eventually I met people that could do certain things better as they practiced and putting in a lot more effort than I did. But I never thought of it as a job, just something I loved and couldn't believe they paid me to do it.  I never made the money my peers in college made, but I never would have changed anything even if I got the chance to do that part of my life again.  

Sorry - Don't mean to brag as much as telling other people makes me still feel like who I once was and not the cripple I am now.

Anyway - It is funny, but I had a similar experience with my SO.

I got married 5 days before leaving for a year long remote tour to South Korea. This was before the days of the internet, skype, or even E-mail.  It was $4.25 a minute so we only talked once a week. It was terrible...except it was the funnest year of my life.  It was my first F-16 assignment in the last of the old Air Force where we flew every day and drank to excess every night.  We were so young and stupid we placed bets on whose liver panel would be the worst each month due to alcohol.  If you look at when I started drinking and how much, I would (and often was) labeled an alcoholic, but I just enjoyed it.

Interestingly, I have the exact opposite of an addictive personality.  I had to give up drinking and after 25 years of at least having a couple drinks nightly (and often quite a few more), but I was able to just stop and haven't had one since. No cravings or anything other than I'd prefer if I still could have one occasionally. Same with Oxy.  My body is way physically dependent on it, (as I recently was hospitalized where I couldn't eat or drink anything for 2 weeks.  I had to be given all my meds via IV and they couldn't believe I was on 600 mg a day and put me on IV 60 mg a day and besides being in insane pain, I went into withdrawals.  Finally they sedated me until my wife brought in my prescriptions and they put me back on my correct dose.  Horrible.  I have a medic alert bracelet with a chip in it now but when I have to go to the ER now, I bring my pain meds to prove I'm not an addict trying to get more). Anyway, long story short, I could stop it too, except for the physical dependence, but I can understand the addictive personality, it's just now me but if one thing I've learned from my disease is how different people's physiology and psychology can be.


I've become a lot more compassionate after getting this.  My younger sister got it before I did.  Although she is 4 years younger, she started symptoms 8 years ago.  Everyone in our family thought she was just an addict until I started having symptoms and they found the autoimmune connection, tested her, and found she had the same diseases.  It is a combination of Rheumatoid Arthritis, Lupus, MS, Parkinson's, and NF. To top it off, I no longer create antibodies for pathogens.  I have to get an infusion of antibodies every 3 weeks now.  A $10K blood product made from 4000 blood donations. I am alive because of the generous donations of so many people.  

But to continue, all the autoimmune drugs lower the immune system, so each one I've tried I've either gotten pneumonia, or thrush (a fungal infection in the mouth throat and sinuses) which has destroyed my lungs so much that I have to be on O2 now.  I never knew autoimmune could be so painful and destructive.  

Please don't take offense if you're religious, but my Fighter Pilot friends all tease me that I must have pissed on Jesus' tomb one day while we were deployed there to catch all of that at once.  

As far as children, both my wife and I stayed child free until I was almost 40. We both continued our education; she has a PhD in Artificial Intelligence, while I got my MS in encryption, Astro Physics, and AI as well. We enjoyed life, traveled, mountain climbed, hiked all over the world, but between my deployments and her jobs and school we were apart 10 of my 24 years in the Air Force.  But we both just kind of one day said it was time and I guess she was still extremely fertile and I was a good shot because all three of our kids were planned and all hit on the first shot. 3 girls all 2 years apart.  

It is difficult having kids, but it's also the most wonderful experience. It is scary having them as a 20 or so year anchor. I have a female friend who really got messed up when her dad died when she was 10.  Right now my oldest is 9 and my youngest is 5, and the stress of me thinking my death may screw up the lives of the 3 most wonderful girls is unfathomable.  I have to keep it out of my mind.  I used to think panic attacks were fake or were from weak people not being able to control themselves.  But I've had several now just because I'm so scared of them being messed up by my departure. 


To tell the truth, It sucks beyond belief, as the pain has reached the point even with meds that I would have self departed if it wasn't for the kids. I let my wife see my pain and let her comfort me, but I'm still able to push it away for the kids.  They know I'm really ill, I mean they see me bedridden on O2, so they know it's bad, but I still play with them daily in my bed... even my 5 year old can beat me at just about any video game now that my movement is so impaired, but even I couldn't imagine the joy I got just a couple days ago when my youngest said she would ""help me get to the next level"" 

Well... thanks for listening to me now... I'm sorry for the rant, but it's so difficult as each day becomes more painful and yet I have to press ahead.  I really don't know how much longer I can take it but what can I do?  Never did I see this coming.

Take care and write if you ever just want to BS.

And Thank you again!

"cby98d5","I wold appreciate it if you did not put into quotations things that i did not say.  For the record i think it is obvious that the settlements and the settlers are disgusting and are an extreme detriment to the peace process.  Apart from that you are completely wrong about the israelis ""Cluster bombing everything/saturating everything with white phosphorus "".  In operation pillar of defense the IDF went took the absolutely unheard of measures of dropping benign noisemakers on roof tops of hamas (military) targets prior to strikes, making phone calls to surrounding civilian buildings to warn of incoming operations in the area allowing time for evacuation, and completely calling off strikes on known high value targets when civilians appeared in the area.  I suggest you watch British Colonel Richard Kemp's testimony to the UN in which he details the extreme measures to which the IDF went to avoid civilian casualties in gaza even as their own civilian population centers were being targeted by rocket fire.  I in no way feel that the palestinians as a people are any more interested in the continuation of violence, let alone being""nasty, malevolent people who love death"" and i do not understand why you continue to claim that i do.  I do not know how many times or how many ways i can say it, so i will try one more time.  The palestinians are a people caught in the cross fire between the Israelis and their arab neighbors.  The Arabs have demonstrated time and time again how sincerely they do not give a fuck about the palestinians, and are extremely willing to place them in the cross fire in order to hurt israel politically.  Iran does not fund and direct Hamas because they love their palestinian brothers and want to see them thrive as a people.  They fund them for the same reason they fund Hezbollah, because they seek to destroy the Jewish state.  I fully acknowledge that in many instances Israels military responses are disproportionate and somewhat reckless, but this is to send the message that it is a terrible idea to attack them and serves as an extreme deterrent.  It is the absolute right of a country to protect its citizens from direct attacks and while they should and do take measures to minimize collateral damage a state in israels situation simply can not survive without a policy of swift and severe retaliation against those attempting to destroy it.  The arab states have done virtually nothing for the palestinians except to continue the warfare in which civilians from all sides perish.  I dont see how you can ask the israelis to disengage the WB and gaza while the groups operating there continue to send rockets into israeli towns and cities.  I dont see how you can believe that such a disengagement would lead to anything other than an increase of rocket barrages and suicide attacks.  I done see how you can expect the israelis to favor the well being of the palestinians over their own citizens.  I dont see how you can watch Hamas launch rockets from apartment buildings and schools, hide their leadership in the basements of hospitals, and tell their children that their greatest aspiration should be detonating themselves in a crowd of jews and tell me that they are acting n the best interest of their people.  And i absolutely dont understand how you can look at the history of every war israel has ever fought and not notice that every one has been started by the arabs attempting to wipe the jews off the map.

"cbx5e4n","&gt;LOL!  History-rewriting is fun, ain't it!! 

It can't really be called rewriting history to call into question something that isn't a verifiable fact. Read Allan Peskin's ""Was There a Compromise of 1877,"" and you'll see what i'm talking about.

&gt;Economics too! 

Prove me wrong.

&gt;I guess the economic studies that use the Laffer curve should have consulted with you. 

Many of those studies conclude tax rates drastically higher than we have now would be better. And, the vast majority had not been put into practice. Keynesian economics, on the other hand, have been put into practice, and were responsible for the economic growth and stability of the 50's and 60's.

&gt;How did you become a historian and an economics expert? 

One doesn't need to be an expert to look up something, and see differing opinions by experts on the historicity of the compromise of 1877.

Also, one need not be an expert to see that the Laffer curve requires a gross oversimplification of taxation to be calculated, since it doesn't account for tax code complexity, tax rate complexity, and labor pool complexity.


&gt;I mean, anyone who flat out denies a piece of history is usually labeled tin-hat, 

I'm not denying it could have happened. I'm saying that an undocumented, informal agreement that was only half fulfilled without any political blowback, and with the rest of the terms being inevitabilities, might not be your best example of a compromise. This especially so, since it can't even be verified by historians.


&gt;and to further debunk an economic principle

Pointing out the flaw in the Laffer curve does debunk it though. Unless we adopt a single tax rate for all, using a single tax rate to calculate what various tax brackets should be is not only reckless, but incredibly shortsighted.

&gt;...you must have a Nobel Prize sitting on your shelf.  Is this your appeal to authority?

In order for it to be an appeal to authority, shouldn't I have to actually appeal to authorities? Shouldn't that be the crux of my argument?

Since we're on the subject, I'll show how you've been appealing to authority, as though that alone should be sufficient to prove me wrong.

Me: The Laffer curve is using an oversimplified formula for a complex issue.

You: I guess the economic studies that use the Laffer curve should have consulted with you. 

Not a one of those experts would disagree with my assessment. Laffer wouldn't even disagree. He knows it is oversimplified. He admits it is oversimplified. He did it on the back of a napkin to demonstrate that reducing taxes doesn't mean you have to reduce spending. Ever since, it's been overblown into a whole monster of its own stupidity that people with no understanding of how it works will trot out when faced with the facts that taxes need to be raised on the top earners, and the past shows how well that works.

Now, try not appealing to authority. Just prove me wrong.

**Question 1:**

The Crusading army of the First Crusade came in two waves. The First Wave consisted of tens of thousands of paupers and other poorer classes led by zealous fanatics like Peter the Hermit and Walter the Penniless (a misnomer that kind of stuck - his real name was Walter Sans Avoir). With the promise of gold and riches, and as a way to atone for their sins, these peasants (people who had nothing to lose and everything to gain) essentially dropped everything that they were doing and marched to Byzantium. Naturally, they were by and large ill-equipped for the journey (probably armed with little more than sticks, clubs, and pitchforks - some of the lords and their retinues might have been equipped with more knightly armor) and had to ransack the countryside on their way. When they reached Byzantine lands, they came under escort, but Emperor Alexios was not yet expecting such a large army so quickly and was just a little nervous when he heard that thousands of fanatics were passing into his newly-consolidated Empire (Alexios put in a herculean effort to restabilize the Empire after many disasters, revolts, and invasions). But, besides a bit of pillaging near Dyrrachion, the peasants were rather well behaved. Again though, Alexios wasn't a fan of the shanty town built outside of the Byzantine capital of Constantinople. This was the army that got massacred shortly after cajoling the Emperor to ferry them across the Bosporus to go toe-to-toe with the Turkish army.

The second wave of the army consisted of what we would consider professional soldiers. These were the personal armies of the lords of the realms of Norman Sicily (Bohemond of Taranto), the Duchy of Lorraine (Godfrey of Bouillon), and the Duchy of Narbonne, County of Toulouse, and the March of Provence (Raymond of Toulouse). The army of Norman Sicily was a highly-developed and well-trained army established by Bohemond's father, Robert Guiscard, who was a mortal enemy of the Byzantine state. Alexios had to deal with two invasions of Dyrrachion shortly after his coronation and lost a great portion of troops trying to defend the Byzantine West from the Normans. Although Alexios lost the second siege, Robert's death halted any further reinforcements and the Byzantines were able to reclaim the Dyrrachion in the middle of the 1080's. Anyways, I would think that the armies from France were of a similar caliber. These armies consisted of many armored sergeants, likely armed with spears and long shields, as well as a large contingent of the lords' personal knights, who at this point in history would have been armed with a suit of mail, a long shield, a lance, and a longsword, mace, or other similar weapon. There would have been a large contingent of mounted knights, but also some foot-knights as well. There would have also been a sizable corp of archers - likely longbows for the French, and shorter composite bows (derived from Arab styles) for the Normans, although the Normans may have also used longer bows. These soldiers would have been very well drilled, and perhaps better disciplined than contemporary Byzantine soldiers. The Latin cavalry would have been masters of the full-gallop charge (which the Byzantines highly respected in battle); seen as reckless, but very brave.

**Question 2:**

 As I hinted to before, a ""knight"" during this period was a soldier who was a servant of a noble or petty lord, providing him with a certain amount of agricultural payment as well as military service in times of war. The feudal system was alive and well in many parts of France and Italy at the time of the First Crusade, and so there would have been many knights available for service. Knights could be found both mounted or on foot, but it generally denoted a well-trained and drilled heavy cavalry or infantry soldier. For much of the Medieval period, the knight was the pinnacle of soldiery - a hundred knights was seen as equivalent to thousands of regular soldiers. 

The Knights Templar (or the Fellow-Soldiers of Christ and of the Temple of Solomon), perhaps the most famous of the Crusading Holy Orders, was founded shortly after the Capture of Jerusalem in 1099. They were seen as the most militant of the Crusader Knights and had a reputation for being ferocious and impetuous in battle. They were highly trained and a supreme elite amongst the knights of the Holy Land. They also became very rich due to their controlling/defending of the trade routes within the Crusader states. Like many of the other Crusader Orders, the Templars built a number of ""bases"" or strongholds in the Holy Land to launch raids on the Saracens or defend pilgrims from Saracen invaders. Perhaps their greatest military success was the Battle of Montgisard where 500 Templar knights, under the command of the leper-king Baldwin IV, were able to defeat a 26,000-man army under the command of Saladin. Unfortunately, the Templars, due to their power and because of the overly militant nature, and also because of their failure to defend the Holy Land during the fall of Jerusalem in 1187 came under fire from both the Church and the European nobility. Many of their members were hanged and persecuted over the next century, and eventually, their order was dissolved in 1312. Their symbol was a surcoat of white with a red cross emblazoned at the center.

Perhaps one of the lesser-remembered, but equally important orders, the Knights of St. John and the Hospital (or the Hospitallers), were also one of the knightly orders founded shortly after the success of the First Crusade. The Hospitallers were a bit more focused on public works and opened many hospitals throughout the Holy land to care for the sick and the poor. However, they were also well-regarded as steadfast and highly trained knights, and they fulfilled a role in many ways similar to the Templars, but with less focus on impetuosity and more focus on reliability. They commanded one of the largest and most well-known fortresses in the Middle-East - Kerak de Chevaliers (The Castle of Knights), which lasted as their headquarters until the fall of the Crusader States. After the fall of the Holy Land, the Hospitallers moved to the island of Rhodes, where they built up a powerful infastructure, unfortunately caught in the death throes of the Byzantine Empire and the rise of the Ottomans. They were ousted from Rhodes and ended up on the island of Malta, which they developed into a thriving country. In 1565, a force of just 9,000 Hospitallers defeated a 40,000+ man Ottoman invasion force, solidifying Malta as a highly defensible power base and providing a glimmer of hope for a Christian Europe besieged by the might of the Ottoman Empire. Although Malta was eventually taken over by the French, and finally the British during the Age of Sail, the Knights Hospitaller (known also as the Knights of Malta) still endure today as a thriving Holy Order with many members across the globe. Their symbol today is a white Maltese Cross on red, but used to be (during the Crusades) a black surcoat with a white star-like or bannered cross.

The Byzantines did not have ""knights"" in the same way that the Latin Crusaders did, although they had troops that filled a similar role. After the Battle of Manzikert in 1071, the Byzantine Empire had lost a good portion of its military might and prestige. By the time of Emperor Alexios' accession - much of the military had been neglected even on top of the loss of many troops at Manzikert. Therefore, Alexios essentially got the ""scraps"" of what was left. He used this portion of the army to defend Dyrrachion, but this army too was annihilated. At one point, Alexios could only call upon 500 men in the whole of the Empire thanks to his predecessors. He used these troops to build the core of his army. 

Despite this enormous setback, the Byzantines had a number of highly effective units at their disposal. First off, the Varangian Guard (the Guardians of the Emperor, also known as the ""Axe-wielding Guardsmen"" or, humorously, ""the Emperor's winebags"" after their penchant for consuming vast amounts of alcohol) were some of the most feared and effective shock troops used throughout the entirety of the medieval period. Recruited from Vikings and Rus (and later Englishmen), these ferocious warriors were trained with a number of weapons, including their native *rhomphaia* a massive two-handed battle axe, the *spathion* - which was akin to the old roman longsword, and sometimes a bow or spear. Early in their history, they wore a suit of mail with a Norse style visor helm with splinted metal gauntlets, pauldrons, and greaves, as well as *kremasmata* (battle-skirt), but later on upgraded to wear the *klibanion* (highly effective laced metal lamellar) and a Byzantine double-mail facemask+visored helm. These warriors swore a oath to protect the Emperor and were highly loyal to him. They also repeatedly showed themselves as dedicated warriors. Many times in their history, the Varangians were the last men on the battlefield, defending the Emperor to their last breath, even when all of the other Byzantine soldiers had routed. 

The Byzantines also had the *Athanatoi* (literally ""those without death"" = ""Immortals"") which, from what we can glean, were a form of super-heavily armored cavalry akin to the *Kataphraktoi* of Basil II's army. They were armed with double mail, a *klibanion*, a mail face-mask + visored helm, splinted pauldrons, greaves, and gauntlets, a fully-armored mount, and an *epilorikion* (a padded vest that was worn over the armor). They carried, typically, a *paramerion* (Byzantine sabre) or *spathion*, a pennant lance, a Byzantine or flanged mace, and sometimes (depending on the situation) a composite bow and *plumbatae*-like heavy darts. They were so well armored, that many accounts report soldiers coming back from battle pincushioned with arrows and yet the horse and rider were perfectly fine. Emperor Alexios himself, in a desperate attempt to rally his troops, once charged into a row of Turkish spearmen and was able to cut them down with ease without so much as a scratch. Interestingly enough, however, these units were not typically used for the full-gallop charge (they were too heavily armored for a full-gallop charge and the Byzantine army manuals advised against such a ""reckless"" action).",1373996823,"the latin cavalry would have been masters of the full-gallop charge (which the byzantines highly respected in battle); seen as reckless, but very brave.","reckless, but very","reckless","but",TRUE,"reckless , but very brave","brave",NA,"very",1

"carg9bz","&gt; I think diving in feet first where there's any significant chance of making contact with an opposition player is reckless. 

If you know going in that you're likely to hit the other guy, it's reckless.

But just because you *did* hit the other guy does not mean you were reckless going in.

&gt; It's even banned in soccer (any slide tackle...)

Yes, intentional slide tackles are dangerous and reckless.

Based on ops description of the event, I'm imagining the offensive player bid legs first without seeing somebody in front of him, and then a player in the middle of an arms-first bid came into view from the side to D the disc.  So when he started his slide, he was playing the disc and didn't have a player in front of him.

Was it reckless?  I absolutely can't say either way.

But OP seems to be saying ""because I got hit, it was reckless"" which is absolutist and not at all a general truth.

&gt;Also, I don't understand how situation 1 could happen. Somehow you managed to extend your arms further out and catch the disc by diving feet first rather than arms first?

I did not say that I caught a disc with a foot-first bid that I could not have caught with an arm-first bid.

"caq9z02","I have two stories-One is my ex who I wouldn't switch schools for (move from Seattle to central Washington) and one of my husband who I moved from Seattle to Australia for. 

My ex who I had been dating for almost a year and who I had known for almost 3, wanted me to transfer from my university to his. And it felt wrong. I told him no. I said, maybe the year after this one. I felt like there was something, some reason I was in Seattle and I wanted to stay at my school to find out. He didn't take that well and was mad, but I had to do what was right for me and he eventually conceded that waiting another year before moving in together is a good idea. Honestly, there were just too many doubts about him and although at the time I was head over toes in love with him and I did want to marry him, I am so very happy I never moved. We would have had a horrible time and I doubt we would have lasted very long if I moved in with him. Not to mention I would have regretted it and probably resented him for taking me away from my university. 

My husband on the other hand, I met online. I was in Seattle, him in Australia so it was several months into dating before meeting each other in real life. Right before I met him, I was so nervous. I was scared of how badly things could go- what if we didn't mesh sexually? What if I hated how he smelt or sleeping in the same bed. My grandma was worried about me hopping on a plane alone to visit a foreign country- she actually said she was worried about white slavery. His grandma said she didn't trust ""that girl"" and told my husband to be careful. I got onto a plane with less than 50 dollars in my pocket, it was impetuous and somewhat reckless but I had no doubts I would be safe with him. I visited him for 3 weeks and after the first week I knew he was the one I was going to marry. 

When I got back to the US we started planning my international move. We were only together for 8 months and only *together* for 3 weeks. Our one year anniversary came up and we were engaged. Although there were some fears- he was worried that I would be so homesick that I would eventually grow to resent him and I was afraid of how much I'd miss my family and would end up on a plane heartbroken because I had to choose one over the other. But besides those fears, which are not small, there was never a second of doubt that it was the wrong thing to do. He also never for a second put even the slightest pressure on me to move to him, it was always my choice. We both know it could have ended up badly, hell we've only been married for 3 years something could still go wrong. But by the time we got married, only having been in the *same hemisphere* for a total of 8 weeks, it felt right. There were no doubts or second thoughts before our wedding even if there we were a bit nervous.

**TL;DR:** Having the occasional nerves is *much* different than the huge doubts that make something just feel wrong. Intuition is a powerful thing and although it can be wrong, if you're having this many doubts all is not right in Whoville. Although there may be more to the story from what you've written, if I was in your shoes I wouldn't move in with her. That same pushiness/half begging and the mountain of what ifs is why I didn't want to move in with my ex. In your shoes, I might consider moving to the same city in several months' time- as you seem to have positive associations with where she is, it would allow you to spend more time with her in person, and you seem to like the idea of that sort of move.

"capbhv3","I get it. Films can be frustrating, especially Prometheus, with the films many mistakes made by the ""heros"" and other central characters. Regardless, the argument stands that without these ""mistakes"" there wouldn't be a film or there wouldn't be inciting incidents that move the plot forward. Prometheus was just careless and reckless but I also think that they made sure the audience didn't care about any of the characters because they would eventually die, thus making them all really dumb besides the remaining.

 When I first saw Jurassic Park I was in the very first row sitting on my uncle's lap in a packed theatre. I was 9. I've seen the film a million times after but i'll never forget that first time because like the first few times you smoke herb, it was the best. Recently seeing the film remastered in 3D I found myself laughing at parts and thinking they were silly with all the contradictions and stupid decisions made by ""smart"" characters but still love the film. Films need incidents that change the course of the plot and without them there isn't a story. Why did John Hammond decided to do the first test tour with the scientists that will back up the park and his grand kids when the entire staff just left? Why was Dennis the ONLY guy who knew the security systems. Why didn't the kid get the gun that Dr. Sattler couldn't reach with her foot. The list goes on and on. The answer is simple, because then they would have finished the tour and everything would have been dandy. 

I expect this from World War Z. I went into this movie thinking Independence Day + Zombies = World War Z. I'm not looking for a riveting plot line or character development, i'm looking for fun. I don't need to KNOW Brad Pitt's character. All I need to see him do is kick ass and wish that he was my best friend in the situation of a zombie apocalypse. 

Ridley Scott is a big boy and was able to change how Prometheus ended but he didn't. As someone who is in the film industry I know of the politics and it's not what it appears to be.

It's not about being *bad*, it's about being *reckless*. People, in general, are averse to risk. *But*, there's this hormone called testosterone that promotes recklessness. The past few years I've been doing some solid self-observation and come to the conclusion that I produce all sorts of testosterone, and that it is the primary reason I am capable of attracting women.

As an example: I ride a motorcycle. It is currently my only vehicle. I had to replace the front tire recently because it was getting low on tread. I was set to ride it home this past Monday from a family gathering when a family friend who's been riding longer than I've been alive informed me he wouldn't ride on that tire for a million dollars. Personally, I didn't see the big deal, I'm probably not going to crash and even if I do, people have experienced worse, it's nothing I can't bounce back from. But I saw that it was upsetting my family that I had planned on risking it so I borrowed a vehicle for the day instead and just swapped out the tires the next day. As more of an example, I routinely ride my motorcycle while under the influence of various substances. My excuse is that I know I can handle it. Others view this as a ""bad boy"" thing, others describe my behavior as reckless and dangerous, personally I'm just having a good time and not letting fear control my life.

I'm a 17 year old guy, and I understand that I may be out of place in this thread, and I'll admit that sex is always a milestone, but that's not the sole reason I talk to girls.  I talk to girls in search of someone to hold and watch movies with, someone I can hold hands with in public who gives me the feeling of utmost pride and importance because she means a lot to me, and someone who I can comfort in her time of need with the belief that she will do the same for me.

I say this after dropping someone that meant a lot to me upon realizing that our goals were not compatible.  I chased her for nine long months, and she told me she didn't want commitment.  Sex wasn't what I wanted from her, I wanted a special bond that would turn us into something more.  Now, it hurts like hell knowing that we might never happen, and I'll defend the fact that she was well beyond a sexual desire to my very last breath.

And before any of you argue that dating is only a title, and I shouldn't have fretted about it, to me it's more.  It's a pledge, albeit may be temporary, of loyalty and devotion.  

Why did I pessimistically mention it's impermanence, you all may ask.  It's because permanence is unreasonable.  When I say I love someone, it doesn't mean I'll love them forever because that's an impossible guarantee; it means they mean more to me than anything else upon this planet at the moment.

I told her this. I told her that I loved her.  Many will call me young and foolish and reckless, but to this day, I don't regret it.  I would have died for her.  I would have gone through anything to make her happy or turn her shitty day around.  With all this in mind, I think I deserve to mutter those three beautiful words.

And all I asked in return was her pledge of loyalty and devotion, the belief or idea, not even guarantee, that after I do everything in my power to make her feel like the most special being on the planet, she won't ride off into the sunset with some other asshole but that I'll have the honor of being the asshole she rides off with.

"c9zyi84","I'm a dude who is in to dudes. My record is about 15 seconds. A few years ago in West Hollywood, I'm sitting on my couch jacking off to porn when I hear a knock upon my door. I pull up my sweatpants and try to tuck my boner away. I answer the door halfway covering my lower half from showing any signs of bonage and peek my head out. The guy says in a really sexy French accent, ""you ready for some fun, sexy?"" I, being a dope, say, ""what,"" although I realize quickly he is looking for his hookup, who was my neighbor. He quickly realized his mistake and apologizes, ""So sorry, wrong apartment."" I'm not usually sly or suave but I was feeling extra confident that day and this guy was insanely cute so I fling the door open just as he's turning to leave, pull the front of my pants down, and say, ""Doesn't have to be."" He grabbed me by the boner and led me to my bed, pushed me down on the mattress, and proceeded to ride me to completion. I never had a hookup before that.

Don and Roger each owned 25% of the company before Lane's death and Joan's partnership. Deducting 1% for Joan, and adding 2% - 3% depending upon how Lane's stake was distributed, they now own a majority of the company.

"c9p3yft","You seem very intelligent and smart enough to reflect and in all honesty, the way you eloquate yourself seems similar to me. I used to question my own self. Do I have ADHD? I'll never know. My father didn't believe in sending me for diagnosis as it is a negative stigma in Asian culture to have a special needs child. However, the fact you're able to focus all your thoughts into one common aspect of your identity leads me to believe that you are simple what many people who question themselves as...  highly cerebral. We aren't distracted perhaps (I'm not in you or go through your daily thoughts so I don't know), but often think too much. Distraction or jumping from one idea to the next may just simply be on method of our cerebral minds needing the constant impulsive momentum. I'm young and can only relate as best my life experience and empathy can allow me to do and I believe you're a cross between a humble depression of insignificance and having the ego of someone who knows the potential they have. Pick one.


 I've experienced those very same exact thoughts when I was younger. Bitter and angry at my inadequacies, fear, failure, disappointment, addictive habits, and escape. Great grand goals never reached. I never finished them and it all boiled back down to little things like, ""I never finish HW. I always do it up to the last problem and stop!"" Stuff to that extent. 

I've grown a lot since then and really fought through to these things. I've learned a lot, philosophized, went full 'retard' and saw both sides of the coin of what I can describe as the spectrum of human thinking. Ignorance and englightenment. The brain is one of the most resillient thing in your body. My brain hates me; it's a crazy malleable at this point; I could clinically be insane. 

I am assuming you're in America because America is a weird ass place. We have so many things that distract us from what is tangibly intangible, true, and genuine, from ourselves, and offer escape from all that I've just described. We're so diverse with ideas, culture, and it's just weird. I don't know if you've traveled or your life experiences, but travel as much as you can. I don't mean go to Europe. Go to South East Asia or India. Phillipines, the Islands. The home where possible Homo-erectuses had cross-bred with Homo-sapiens 500,000-1.7mya.  

**Last point before some advice:** There are so many different ideas, schools of thoughts, motivational concepts, not giving a fuck, and other ideas that run from seddit, stopgaming, no fap, and getmotivated, hownottogiveafuck, and so many other self-improvement subs out here, but there is one thing after doing about a years worth of enormous investigation and reading of everything that these self-improvement subs recommend, it is that you must get this in your head:

No one gives an absolute fuck about you. No one is going to pity you. No one cares about how much you self-loathe and no one cares about what you think or what you're opinions are. 

So what's the point to life? Learn to be gratify for yourself. No I don't mean jerk yourself off, but do things for yourself. It sounds a little selfish, but life on many levels goes in this fashions: dependence ----&gt; independence ----&gt; interdependence. You're a child dependent, you become an adult independent, and then you become interdependent on your spouse (SO or someone important) and family. The love we seek, the admiration we want, and achievement we so want to have under our names come as we enter these stages appropriately. So far, it seems with your line ""if I'm really lucky maybe someone will give a shit"" makes me think that you're dependent emotionally concerning your achievements. 


What can I do now? I'm terribly depressed since you've just called me an emotionally dependent bastard while stating that no one's going to pity me...


Most people who receive a lot of love. The good kind of love that is not reckless, but easy and sustaining aren't usually necessarily depressed. A generalization of course and I wish I was more elaborate in this statement, but I'll return it when my brain isn't fried (I went to a house festival this weekend... *snort* *snort*), but do not let that hinder you from at least reading my perspective. I've helped dozens over reddit before and hopefully I can help others.


Anyways! If you cannot receive love from the world (in your work, admiration of your achievement, and relationships), give it. There is a fine line of being dellusional, creepy, or insane, but you're intelligent enough to distinguish it. You hold your achievements and work to your own *true* standards. Newton's laws of physics state that with every reaction, there is an equal and opposite reaction. Do you know why puppies are so loveable (unless you're allergic or have predisposed hate to dogs) is because they're unrelentingly friendly and loving. They can expend their 'love' and attention free willing without thinking about it, making them universally amiable.


Go through the gauntlet. Fight your demons and re-tune your personal standards of what you can or cannot do; what is in your ability now to write is improve on them so that one day you can become the writer you can be. The thing about writing is that the greatest writers who I assume you may choose yourself to model after were often very fucked up, but that is what creates for the best work. However, you must find strength and conviction in yourself first. You've got to accept your shortcomings and then furiously reject them. You've come to right place by starting here. 

TL;DR (this will sound very asshole of me if you didn't read it) is man up. I'm not a main advocate of outwardly prescribing this advice, but man the fuck up. You don't like something about yourself or downright hate it for reasons that are purely internal, change it. No one gives a shit about you or your fucking feelings. This should however make you less anxious because when you understand this, your anxiety of what others think about you go away and rather what you think of yourself matter (causing you to live a better quality of life mentally). The battle is all yours, no one esle's. There are so many books, lectures, and ways to get to where you are... it is definitely not an impossible goal, but you've got to stop playing yourself for a victim even if you are clinically at a 'disadvantage' with ADHD or any mental illness. However, you've come to the right place to do it however which is good start.

A friend and I were doing a language exchange program in a small rural town in Canada. We were stranded at a grocery store when a storm hit, so we figured we'd hitchhike our way back home, as it was an hour's walk.

And of course, the person who stops for us is the greasiest hippie I've ever seen. The first thing he says to us is, ""This is my driver's license. This is a picture of my daughter.

"c8htkmn","Location, not so much.  The theme departed too much from the previous two games; it wasn't noir. 

Much of the game took place in brightly lite areas which doesn't lend well to the dark &amp; gritty theme they were trying to achieve. We saw Max acting like he was filled with grief but didn't show any reason for it.  The story was just Max running around killing people and didn't give him any reason to keep fighting until about 3/4th the way through. And even then the plot was flimsy at best, why is he suddenly supposed to feel guilty for the deaths of the very same people he was killing a few hours before?  He was constantly aware that what he was doing was stupid and reckless but made no effort to change, but not even in a compelling way such as with Walker in Spec Ops the Line.  In fact Max constantly calling himself a fuck-up clashed with the gameplay itself. You kill a small army by yourself in the span of seconds and Max keeps complaining he's worthless. 

Then you have the gameplay itself.  The Max Payne series is not a cover based shooter; it's a run and gun, kill everything that moves, super cool slow-mo, action movie style game.  Hiding behind boxes and chest high walls is none of these things.  The only times you get the feeling of the previous two games are in the forced bullet time scenes. The game was broken up into individual gun battles with no option to return to past areas for health or ammo, eliminated any strategy, planning, or consequence of failure.  Every time you die you get a little bit more health and ammo back, play long enough and you are guaranteed to beat the level. You don't even need to bother with taking your pills, you use them automatically when would normal die provided you can hit the last guy who shot you, if you're outta bullets or he's in a spot where that's impossible you get to wait 5 or 6 seconds until BT wears off and you can finally try again.

"c8f39gs","Welcome to the fabulous world of being a Montreal Canadiens fan!  There's a lot of story lines going on with the Habs right now, but I'll give you the top-line summary (feel free to add):


**Carey Price**

Any discussion about this team starts and ends with Carey Price.  He was the 5th overall pick in 2005, which represented the team's highest draft pick in quite some time.  He burst into the league with amazing numbers, but his work ethic started to slip as his success got to his head, and had a few down years.  A few years ago, Jaroslav Halak, who backstopped Montreal during an amazing playoff run to the Eastern Conference Finals, was traded to St Louis (for Lars Eller plus some Ian Schultz guy).  Fans were pretty upset at the time, but Price has responded in a huge way, and has been our MVP for the last few years.  Even last year, when we had a horrible season, he consistently kept us in games we had no business being in.  Which brings me to my next point...

**We sucked last year**

Montreal finished last in the Eastern conference last year, and 3rd last in the league.  This was mostly caused by ridiculous luck with injuries, as well as a lack of forward depth.  When Andrei Markov had a set back early in the season in his recovery (I'll get to that later), it left a huge whole in our line up.  In addition to that, our captain, Brian Gionta missed most of the year with an injury, which left us ridiculously thin up front.  

Another contributing factor to our season last year was a toxic front office environment.  Pierre Gauthier (our former GM), made a bunch of bizarre moves, such as firing coaches on game day, and trading Mike Cammalleri in the middle of a game.  All of these distractions, combined with a coaching change, lead to the Habs not really having a direction last year.  The one upside of all of this however is...

**Alex Galchenyuk**

Holy crap this kid is going to be good.  Montreal has lacked a top line centre with size for some time now.  You'll often hear Montreal be criticized for being ""small"" (not completely unwarranted - we have a couple small guys like Desharnais and Gionta).  Galchenyuk is our solution to that.  We picked him 3rd overall in the 2012 draft.  He was an interesting choice at the time, because he missed most of the 2011-2012 season with an ACL injury.  However, he tore up the OHL this year during the lockout, and Montreal management made the decision to keep him in the NHL this year.  He started off the year playing great (as was the rest of the team), but has cooled down a bit in recent games.  Either way - he's the future of our team up front.

**PK Subban**

As Galchenyuk is the future of the team up front, PK is the future, as well as the present on the back end.  Even though he's only 24 years old, he has emerged as one of the best young defensemen in the league.  He missed the first 6 games (I think?) of this season due to a contract dispute, but has looked great since returning.  He's often criticized around the league for being too brash and reckless, but those attributes are what make him so endearing to Habs fans.  He'll dazzle you with a great end to end rush, and then absolutely crush someone on the other team with a clean, open ice hit ([example](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_BStkVC_zQ)) the next.

**Andrei Markov**

A few years back, Andrei Markov was in the discussion for being one of the best defensemen in the league.  However, he had a horrible run of serious injuries (two serious ACL surgeries, as well as a laceration caused by Carey Price's skate), which has lead to him to miss the vast majority of the past three seasons.  He came back and skated in some games at the end of last year, but didn't really look like himself, which is understandable as he likely needed to re-adjust to the speed of the game and get his timing back.  This year however, he's fully healthy and playing like the Markov we know and love.  He's reinvigorated our powerplay, and is logging huge minutes while being paired with fellow Russian Alexei Emelin (who can also lay some pretty amazing body checks).




All in all, Montreal is a team with a lot of promise.  The hiring of Michel Therrien as our head coach has brought some structure to the team, which has created a vast improvement thus far over last year's performance.  We're probably a bubble team this year, but we have a good numbers of prospects, as well as a good, solid young core to build around.

"c80zoel","Ex-smoker: It is a *huge* deal. 

Smokers smell bad. They can't do physical activities at the same level as non-smokers (unless they are in great shape otherwise). If is a life choice that will affect this relationship and you have every right to be pissed about it. 

But....and this is a big but...she has a right to smoke. Its legal, she is an adult, and she can make her own choices. She might be part of that mythic one percent of people who can just have an occasional cigarette. They are rare, SUPER RARE, but they do exist. Granted, every soon-to-be smoker thinks they are part of that group for the first one to three months but I cannot say with 100% certainty that she isn't part of that tiny, tiny group. 

Ultimately your only choice is to live with it or leave her if she decides to become a smoker. But hey, no one DECIDES to become a smoker. You decide to have just one cigarette and then things get taken over. But if she becomes a smoker you can leave or stay. 

But it sounds like you have some *time* before that happens so there are a couple of things you can try. One thing no one ever did for me was to stop and say, ""I hate this, knock it off"". I think it is totally appropriate to tell her you are not going to date a smoker and that if this balloons out of control (which it will) you're outta here. Which, when the smell sets in, won't be that tough of a call to make. I also might direct her to read a little. Go read a stop smoking blog. Send her over to /r/stopsmoking. It is depressing as shit. People celebrate things like ""Three days without cigarettes"" because three days without smoking is agony. Once you're hooked you're pretty much in forever as most people never get over wanting one. 

You might get her a copy of ""The Easy Way To Stop Smoking"" by Alan Carr which outlines myths of smoking in a really relatable way. 

And here's some food for thought: that lashing out she's doing is probably shame. EVERYONE knows smoking is a bad idea. What they don't know is that smoking is incredible. I mean, seriously wonderful. There's nothing better than smoking. Some of the happiest moments in my life came from times in which I stepped out of an airport after a long flight and had a cigarette. Sheer Joy. THAT'S the problem. If smoking didn't kick ass NO ONE WOULD DO IT. I think that's why the whole ""Kissing a smoker is like licking an ashtray/Smoking kills you/Look at this guy talking through a hole in his neck"" campaign doesn't work. If you've never smoked you have no intention of smoking. If you've smoked or you are a smoker, you already know that you're killing yourself but that long-term consequence is nothing in comparison to the threat of having to give up the best part of your day. 

So if you think about this in terms of shame you might be able to relate to her better. She knows it is a bad idea but she doesn't really know how bad of an idea it is. She's ashamed for making that decision and she doesn't want to feel judged. I relate to that and I think if you do some soul searching you'll find some times in which you've done shameful things and lashed out about it. That's pretty normal. So come at this with compassion and see if that helps. It IS a stupid decision. It is dangerous and reckless. But it is also a trap that millions and millions of people, good smart people, fall in to. It is not hard to screw it up and it is REALLY hard to fix when you do. Just keep dogging her. Be serious about it because if you can stop her getting hooked right now you're saving her and this relationship. If you don't, you're probably going to end up leaving her because it is really, really gross if you're not also a smoker.

I agree that all shows have plot holes and indeed Dexter has always had some shaky moments, but it was in season 5 and then like wildfire in season 6 it spread to take over the whole thing.

"c7782jy","I would have agreed with you anyway, but you leave no option with factual evidence backing your claims. I know just from all of the firsthand and secondhand experiences I've witnessed or heard about, the motorcyclist was usually at fault. I don't think it's a correct assumption to claim that motorcyclists are careless and/or reckless, but I think it is safe to assume that careless and reckless individuals are drawn, at least to some degree, to motorcycles. 

One factor I think could potentially come into play is motorcycle gangs. They do drugs (mainly meth to keep them awake) and don't exactly have a reasonable concern for themselves or others. I don't think this is an enormous or main factor in motorcycle accidents, but I imagine it is substantial.

In many of the crashes I've seen or heard of in my area, alcohol was involved. And speeding was also a large factor. In fact, I think in ratio of speeding motorcycles to cars I've witnessed first hand, motorcyclists significantly outweigh the cars. 

Although unrelated to two-vehicle collisions, my older brother witnessed a horrible motorcyclist accident. He was heading back alone from a few hour trip when a guy on a motorcycle flew past him. He said he thought ""that guys going to get himself killed."" As he drove on after x amount of time, he came across the guy on the motorcycle crashed on the Sid of the road. I don't remember exact details, but I think he hit a streetlight or traffic light, and I think he was wearing a helmet. Unfortunately it didn't help, and my brother found the guy laying unconscious with his head cracked open and brains hanging out, but still with a pulse (so it had just happened). My brother knew he was going to die but called 911 anyway, and tried to apply pressure to his head wound. He didn't make it and this had a devastating impact on my brother's mental wellbeing. He's my older brother, but I think that he was in his late teens at the time. The point of this story is: to anyone who reads this, you're not invincible. So don't take you life for granted and don't do stupidly dangerous things. 

As far as my original post, I meant that even if you drive responsibly, there are a lot of stupid drivers out there, and to me it's not worth putting my life in their hands. I just don't like the idea of riding at high speeds (not speeding, but the speed limit) on an open vehicle that you just rest upon, with no protection but a helmet that will only reduce your chance of injury or death. I'm atheist (I know, what a surprise on reddit) and I don't think my life is worth risking for the feeling of freedom, fuel efficiency, or looking cool when riding a motorcycle.

"c6zx28t","Part 5:

Harry chooses Sue the T-Rex as a necrosteed. The age of the being equates to the power, but a human has a multiplier.  Nothing however can beat out a 65 million year old dinosaur.  Butters uses his polka suit to keep a steady beat and Harry explains that if Butters doesn't keep the beat Sue will be out of control, similar to Jurassic Park 2.  Harry and Butters ride Sue the T-Rex to the Darkhallow.  As they near the Darkhallow spell, Harry sees the Wardens protecting children from zombies.  Harry sees that none of the zombies got close enough to the children because of the wardens' awesome power.  Harry uses Sue to stop a car attempting to drive at the wardens.  Li Xian attempts to escape from the car but as he tries, Sue eats him similar to the Lawyer from Jurassic Park.  Harry then lets Sue clear out the zombies attacking the wardens.  Luccio scolds Harry about Sue and Harry explains what the Darkhallow vortex will do if it is allowed to complete.  Morgan comes out of the building screaming at Luccio about how he know Harry would turn on them.  Harry then fills in Morgan about all he knows and Morgan gets everyone set to attack the ritual.  Harry, Luccio and Butters are attacked by specters controlled by the Corpsetaker as the Darkhallows spell comes to fruition.  While being attacked Luccio is attacked by Corpsetaker. Harry takes care of the specters by having Sue attack while Harry goes to help Luccio.  Corpsetaker is stabbed by Luccio but during the attack the Corpsetaker switches bodies with Luccio.  Harry kills her with his .44 with a headshot, of course Morgan comes out at this point and Morgan advances on Harry.  

Harry runs as Morgan attacks with Earth magic.  Harry attempts to explain how the Corpsetaker transferred to Luccio's body but Morgan is in quite a rage, attacking Harry mindlessly.  Harry drops his staff and defenses as Morgan charges him.  

Morgan is shot by Ramirez as he is about to strike Harry.  Ramirez has Luccio in the Corpsetaker's body who is giving Morgan the order to stand down.  It is now up to Harry and Ramirez as Kowalski was killed by the specters.  They two hop onto Sue and will take out Grevane and Cowl in that order.  Ramirez explains that Harry is a bit of an icon\hero to the younger wizards of the council.  Harry is surprised and Ramirez says he will take out Kumori and Harry will take out Cowl.

They attempt to flank the necromancers and Sue attacked the zombies that surrounded the Darkhallow.  Harry sends Sue into the inner circle of zombies as he and Ramirez jump off the dinosaur and confront Grevane.  Harry distracts Grevane as Ramirez circles around and kills Grevane from behind with sword and pistol.  As Harry recovers, Cowl simmers from a veil and hits Ramirez with a huge amount of energy.  Harry hits Cowl with Hellfire, but before he can continue Kumori silences Harry with a knife pressed against his neck.  Cowl attempts to use Bob but is double crossed as Harry gives Bob's permission to leave the skull.  Cowl nor Kumori realize this, but Harry thinks Bob's spirit was sucked up in the vortex about to merge with Cowl.  Just as this is about to happen Sue arrives, she is possessed by Bob, and takes out Kumori as Harry hits Cowl over the head just as the Darkhallow is about to finish.  This disrupts the spell and darkness falls.

Harry comes to his senses to the presence of the Erlking.  The Erlking commends Harry for his arrogance, which pleased the Erlking, letting Harry keep his life.  The Erlking does however warn Harry that if their paths should cross again the Erlking will run Harry down.  Harry is curled protectively around Bob's skull and Bob details how Cowl was destroyed by the spell as well as the property around the site of the Darkhallow.  Bob saved Ramirez from the blast by having Sue stand over him before Harry hit Cowl and unleashed the backlash.  Before leaving harry gets the Word from Grevane's corpse and stuffs it into his pocket without anyone noticing.  Harry gets everyone back to his apartment, Butters had apparently told Morgan to take over drumming while he helped out Luccio which ultimately saved her life.  Injun-Joe Listens to Wind came later with more medical wizards to aid in the recovery.   Harry explains to Injun-Joe and Morgan that this wasn't a coincidence, as Morgan thinks, and that he thinks Cowl and the vampires had a deal that would distract the Council so that Cowl could pull off the Darkhallow uninterrupted.  Harry gets the book to Mavra threatening her with his resources that he will kill her if she attempts to use Harry again.  After she leaves Harry's father appears and comforts Harry about the death curse from Cassius.  Harry's dad says that there is a one person door and we all die alone, but Harry is not alone on the other side, finishing by telling Harry he has a good heart and that he should listen to it.  Harry sleeps for days and is monitored by Butters and Thomas.  Murphy comes back with a cast on her arm but won't go into details with Harry about how it happened.  Chicago recovers citing a terrible storm as the culprit for all the destruction.  Luccio has a lot of rehab ahead of her and with her new body and its unknown abilities is relieved of her command, which Morgan takes up until her new condition is evaluated by the Council.  Morgan delivers this message to Harry and says he still thinks Harry is dangerous and reckless but that it is not out of malice or evil intentions.  Butters shows up later with a guitar and practice book for therapeutic purposes.  Harry ends by using the flickum bicus spell to ignite his apartment candles and is shocked at how easily it was performed.  He thanks Butters saying he is a pretty good healer for being a mortician.

The Northern Territory has Mandatory Helmet Laws in certain conditions. 

The increase in Australia's population has increased with a noticeable urban sprawl. In Melbourne we're constantly expanding and we're not investing in cycling infrastructure. The population has spread to turn Melton into a suburb of Melbourne and has made the entire population of Melton dependent on cars to get around. 

Why do people have safety concerns? Because cycling is dangerous. Not reckless but dangerous. Here's a [snapshot](http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/cyclist-killed-in-highway-car-collision-20120210-1s73p.html) of a day in Melbourne's cycling. One fatality and four other accidents that required the attention of paramedics. That doesn't include all the minor accidents that didn't need paramedic attention. 

People had concerns about cycling before helmet laws were introduced which is exactly why we have them. The Royal Australasian College of Surgeons responded to public pressure to examine the situation. They found [cyclists suffered head trauma at three times the rate of Motorbike casualties](http://www.surgeons.org/media/14490/POS_2009-06-25_Road_Trauma_Cycling_Position_Paper.pdf). 

Cycling is clearly [alive and well](http://www.cyclingpromotion.com.au/images/stories/MediaReleaseDocs/2009_Bicycle_Sales_Media_Release_final%20\(1\).pdf) in this country and getting stronger. [Independent examinations into cycling deterents](http://www.pcal.nsw.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0004/90904/Barriers_to_cycling_in_NSW_study.pdf) have found safety is a massive reason people dont' cycle and helmets are barely worth a mention.

3/40 of your deck is Reckless.

You draw 6 during your first turn, giving you a 15% chance to hit a reckless greed. Reckless can (just like Jar Of Greed) be used as MST Bait, Jar gives you a +1, Reckless gives you an instant +2/-2. Averaging at nothing. You also have a just below 10% chance to draw 2 or more Reckless first turn.

However, using that Reckless also gives you a chance to draw into the remaining 34 cards of the deck with 2 Reckless Left. 2/34 Chance to grab even more Reckless Greeds; Reckless Greed does not stack the Draw disadvantage, error using 1 averages at 0 card advantage (but instant options)

Our stories are far more dramatic since they combined extreme danger, weapons, violence, money, power, sex with innocence, wit, and intelligence. We had the best laughs of our life in that time. We we're young and reckless, but also intelligent. Despite our many brushes with death, we all survived and are living successful, productive lives. Our lives balanced out. Ying-yang shit right there.

Tucker Max ... well. Pretty crazy stuff for someone living in a law-and-order country, but pretty lame for someone living in Mexico. I wouldn't imagine being a teenager in the US. It's so ... orderly.

So I was a teenager in Mexico and now a mature adult in the US. The best of both worlds. I wouldn't change a thing.

"c5nq49p","I grew up in a small (~900) Kansas town, so driving around town/the country and drinking beer was one of our favorite past-times. I was stupid and reckless but we did it anyway.

One night myself and two of my friends gathered up a bunch of ""left over"" beers, threw them all in a cooler, and decided we were going to cruise around town all night drinking. We had a couple of quarts of Coors lights, a few bottles of whatever, misc cans, I think maybe even some wine coolers...basically all the stuff left over from parties or other nights cruising that collects at the house of someone with ""cool"" parents. And we had a ton of it too...easily the equivalent of a case for each of us.

We jumped in my friends Firebird and started driving around, looking to see who was out and about. Apparently my friend had just got dumped/blown off by some girl, and he was in a foul mood. We're on Main Street and just pass the town cop, who we all knew well. All of the sudden my friend decides to just tear out and flip a u-turn right in the middle of main street, burning rubber the whole maneuver. Again, we had JUST driven past the town cop; we had waved to each other for cripes sake. 

Cop didn't light it up right away, and I know his thinking was ""Goddamn it you idiots, you're going to make me do this?"" But he does of course, and we're pulled over. 

Each of us had open container and had partaken, and we had a whole cooler full in the back. He doesn't even have to ask if we've got beer, and we're not bothering to hide it. Myself and the other guy are pretty much shell shocked at this point, why our friend driving would be so fucking stupid.

The cop has us get out of the car, open up the trunk. He makes us open and pour out every beer we had, over 60 cans and bottles. He's giving us a bit of a lecture about how we could have been on our way to county jail by now if he really wanted. Of course once it became clear we weren't going to get strung up we're as quiet and respectful as alter boys. Yes sir, no sir, we're headed straight home sir.

"c5791z5","&gt;The idea that these 13/14 year olds that have had sex because they have been in a relationship

Define 'relationship'. I stick by what I said: the vast majority of 14 year olds lack the necessary maturity and knowledge to make a conscious decision about sex. Why are they having sex at 13/14? I find it hard to believe that hormones are *that* pressing - although I'll admit that historically there are arguments for this - and would prefer to lay the blame, if it can be called such, on the people around them who told them that people in relationships have sex.

&gt;Who are we to judge and measure their ""love""?

People who have come out the other side of puberty. But, once again, define love. All of these terms of vague, wishy-washy, undefinable qualities. I'm sure a 13 or 14 year old can be in love. I'm equally sure that by the time that they're 18, what 'love' means to them will have drastically changed.

&gt;You can argue that they are young and reckless but someone mentioned that their parents had sex at 14 and are now married? How do you consider those situations?

Well done them. Exceptions exist for any given circumstance. Anyone thought to ask them if they regretted it? (I would doubt it, but the question has to be asked by *someone*, and they may have insights to offer).

I have to be honest and say that I don't normally consider these situations - who does? (other than fourteen year olds) - but that if I had to, I would ask the question 'can they support a child, should one be produced?' Yes, I know that there is abortion, contraception, all kinds of bells and whistles that can help avoid the problem, but sex is - essentially - a very fun stop on the trainride to parenthood.

Whilst people enjoy sex, I think that they should be prepared mentally and emotionally for the possible side-effects that it can have. Lets rephrase OP's question. What do you think of 13-14 year old mothers?

&gt;Don't you think that speaking about society and its general idea is too much? That it is generalizing something that could have exceptions?

"c553rsn","It's important to understand that what Iceland did is widely considered to be the stupidest move you could ever make, although it does make good headlines.

The reason they are growing faster is because they ignored the problem instead of solving it. The result is going to be that they will recover quicker but nobody will ever invest in them again so their recovery is going to be incredibly short lived.

Let's say you give me money and I say to you in 5 years I will have used your money to make more money and I'll be able to pay you back extra. You say that sounds great here's 10 euro. A year after this I crash my car and I use your money to pay for the car damage instead of investing it and you come back after the 5 years and say where's my money and I say something came up, I had to use it else where sorry. You say fine, fat chance of me giving you any money again and you tell all your friends and now I can't get any money at all from anywhere. This is what Iceland did.

Now let's say you gave your money to our mutual friend under the same promise. The friend also crashes his car and uses the money but who he does is he says to you, look I crashed my car and I need to repair it but I understand you made this invest under the expectation that you will get money back. What I am going to do is I am going to keep my promise on the investment side and I am going to sell my loving room furniture. You go away thinking hey if he gets his car back in order and doesn't look like he is owing to crash it again I'd be willing to give this guy more money because he kept his end of the deal.

That's obviously way over simplified but it's the reason Iceland is going to fail in 5-10 years and why nobody copied their move. It's pretty daft, especially for a country that relies so heavily on DFI. The jailing thing is a different issue, a lot of what was done was reckless but legal.

However it's also very important to remember that the fault of all of this is NOT the reckless bankers, for the most part these guys were doing their job, playing their part in the game. The people that weren't playing their part were the regulatory bodies which is one of the reasons Canada did so well. The euro crisis is also unique in the fact that they set up a currency without any central control really because that was he only way counties would agree to it. Unfortunately they are trying to fix that now and Germany is calling all the shots because they have the fat carrot and that's not good for anyone.

"c552bcs","Just to offer some insight, at least in CA, first offenses typically are required to attend many hours of DUI meetings and sometimes AA meetings a couple of days out of the week for months.  The license is revoked on average for 6-9 months, and then they are required to work at the Sheriffs Office (typically cleaning up garbage in the hot sun.)  With a lawyer you can get it reduced to a wet and reckless, but if you are over .20%, good luck.  Sentences also depend on the judge.  I heard of one judge with a bone to pick with DUI offenders by really throwing the book at them, because his wife was killed by a drunk driver.  I do not blame him.  

He is probably still waiting for his hearing / sentence from the judge, which is typically scheduled a month after the ticket is written.  If you read this OP, I would hire a lawyer ASAP.  They are worth their money in relieving many troubles.  But when all said and done, you are looking at abou $10,000 in fees (lawyer, classes, charges).  This does not include the rise of insurance rates (or the potential of being kicked out of insurance.)   

If I remember correctly, it stays on your record for about a decade (it's going to show up on background checks), and if you are caught with so much as .01 BAC when you are pulled over for whatever reason, you get an automatic DUI no question.  This .01 BAC can even be triggered by taking medicine.  

The police around where I live automatically run everyone's license plates during the weekends after 9PM and will also automatically pull you over if they see you have DUI points against your vehicle.

Most rogues hide in the shadows, and sneak up on their prey.  But you want to make sure your enemy remembers your face.  You don't fight, you dance, and you do it marvelously. With rapier in hand, you challenge your foes with quick jabs and a quicker wit.  The way you move and talk unnerves them, and that's when you strike.  Just as clean as an assassin, only you looked them in the eye.  Everyone will remember your beautiful style, your garish clothes, and your talent.  And that's just the way you want it.

Their are many builds that can complement a non-sneaky style, as you only need combat advantage to get your sneak attack.  You'll focus on dexterity and charisma, and takes skills such as bluff.

To play it, you'll need to be larger than life.  You'll want every one to know who you are, and marvel at your talent.  You're arrogant, foolhardy, and reckless, but your charm and talent pull you through any situation.  You love to talk, any enjoy a challenge.  You don't con people, you figure them out and beat them with style.

And when I say stalk, I'm not talking about the creeps that follow girls for days and jerk off in their van outside of their apartments. I mean literally Zimmerman was moving behind Trayvon like he was prey. I'm from the burbs and some of my friends are Mexicans and live in these sketchy ass trailer parks. We made a mistake of walking back to my friends house after cheifing at just the wrong time and this schizo war vet thought we were stalking him (Complete coincidence that he happened to be slowly pulling out of the neighborhood as we walked out). Needless to say he double backed swerved across four lawns and pulled a shotgun on us. The cops came got social services for the guy and told us to be more aware of our surroundings because we made the guy feel threatened. (I mean to be fair we did look like some sketchy teenagers, so I totally understand especially given his mental illness) After that we just went inside and played N64. Lesson learned, be aware of your surroundings so you don't accidentally fuck with other people, you have no idea who they are or how they will react to what they perceive as aggression. As a teenager I have to side with the kids on this one. Kids do a lot of stupid sketchy shit because they are dumb and reckless but seriously its' all harmless. A couple of my friends have been to jail and I totally understand how much of a dumbass Trayvon probably was. But that's the shit kids do, like some minor break ins were not grounds to go hunting down the black kids in the neighborhood. Zimmerman whether you want to admit it or not was out looking for trouble that night and you know what? he found it. A teenage kid is dead because of him. Yeah the kid was sketchy but nothing that you wouldn't expect of a teenager. Zimmerman should have called the cops if he thought he saw suspicious behavior and then just gone on with his errands. You act like this shit is so uncommon, like a year ago I was getting my ass kicked, like literally getting ghetto stomped by some older kids, the whole time I had a switch blade in my pocket and I chose not to use it because I didn't want to kill these kids over a little bit of weed. Now with the hypothetical situation you established given my past experiences I can pretty much safely say I wouldn't shoot, but I think it would be entirely justified if I did. The problem with your hypothetical is, that's not entirely what happened. We know that Zimmerman was stalking him and   he was out looking for trouble. Zimmerman is entirely responsible for what happened and the fact that he can't man up and admit what he did wrong makes him far less of a man than the wannabe thug Travyon Martin.

&gt;the problem is running a downright reckless and irresponsible Government, no matter what the rules specifically said. 

The problem is that all money in circulation is created as debt, and interest is charged on that debt, making it necessary to put more money in circulation so interest can be paid, but more money in circulation means more debt, which means that debt keeps growing exponentially, and there's always more debt than money. If all debt was paid back (which isn't even possible), there'd be no money left in circulation. 

Also, if all people, corporations, and governments simply refused to take more loans, it'd mean the money supply would shrink. Hence, it's necessary to keep borrowing simply to keep the economy running.

""Sacrifice"" is the story of a man named David Stern. David is a reckless, but remarkably talented soldier and pilot in the Human Defence League military, and like many people in the world, he has a dream.

He dreams of the day where he is recognised as a war hero, just like his father was when he was his age, and it’s this dream, this desire that drives David in everything that he does. He wants people to make movies about him; he wants to be the guy that women want to be with and men want to be. So, when he gets this mission to take down a pissed off terrorist, he’s all game. This is his chance and he knows it.

David’s been waiting his whole life for a mission like this, but his opponent is two steps ahead of him and slowly but surely pushing the galaxy into a war that only David can prevent.

David and his comrades race to track down and assassinate Zeus. The stakes only get higher and David has to choose what rules he must break in order to level the playing field and get the job done.

"c4avo1l","&gt;The stand your ground law allows for you to defend yourself against harm or fear of being harmed, HOWEVER, does that mean that you can suddenly get in the face of someone simply because you have a gun?

The stand your ground law is very poorly defined. A gun is not a penis extender, there's really no reason to ever get in someone's face just because you have one. However, getting in someone's face is not automatically an offense either. George Zimmerman acted carelessly and recklessly, but that does not automatically vindicate Travyon and give him the goahead to allegedly jump the guy.

&gt;Zimmerman left his car with a gun. He even told the 911 operator ""These guys always get away."" in a frustrated tone. It WAS his premeditated decision to not let Trayvon get away, and since Trayvon had done NOTHING illegal this equates to unlawful detention or even possibly kidnapping depending on how you look at it.

It doesn't equate to either of those since there's no indication that he made any attempt to detain or restrain Trayvon. The most that he admitted to doing was following him in public. Sketchy and stupid but not illegal.

&gt;At this point it is Zimmerman who is breaking the law and not Trayvon, and therefore, under the stand your ground law, ANYTHING Trayvon tried to do to protect himself -- whether he came at the guy or not, is perfectly legal. 

What he was doing wasn't illegal. If he had assaulted him, restrained him, threatened him, pulled a gun on him (prior to the encounter anyway), or cornered him then yes, he may have had reason to stand his ground. However if following someone and asking them what they're doing there is a capital offense then I'm afraid that every crabby old timer with too much time on their hands is thoroughly screwed. There's not even any indication that he left public property while doing so. It's stupid and reckless but not illegal.

&gt;As a woman I'm concerned that the cops seem to be saying it is OKAY for an armed assailant to detain you on public property, regardless of their reasons. If I'm walking down the street and a man gets in my way and says ""STOP!"" Unless I see a badge I'm not stopping, and if I see a gun I'm fighting like hell and screaming for help. 

There's no evidence at all suggesting that he was detained in any way. That's not what the police are saying at all. If you fight someone for no other reason than the fact that they're carrying a gun and said ""stop"" then you could very well end up in the same situation. If you misread their intentions and start a confrontation then they also have the right to stand their ground, same as both parties involved here. The definition of what is considered a ""threat"" is extremely vague and thanks to stupid laws like this it usually ends up with the person who is left standing being the one who is right.",1334122628,"it's stupid and reckless but not illegal.  &gt;as a woman i'm concerned that the cops seem to be saying it is okay for an armed assailant to detain you on public property, regardless of their reasons.","stupid and reckless","reckless",NA,FALSE,"stupid and reckless","stupid",NA,NA,0

Cycling is dangerous. Not reckless but dangerous and it's important that we make it less dangerous. Helmets are a simple, cheap and effective way to make cycling much safer. If you think cycling isn't dangerous here's an [article from The Age](http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/cyclist-killed-in-highway-car-collision-20120210-1s73p.html) which makes for interesting (but tragic) reading. A woman without a helmet died in a cycling accident. ""Helmets save lives"" is the quote the police gave and it's backed up by the guy from cycling Victoria. Also of interest is the fact that on the same day Paramedics were called to four other cycling accidents. In one day on Melbourne's roads there five bike accidents which required the attention of paramedics, one of those incidents was a fatality. Bike riding is dangerous as is any activity which shares the road with drivers. But it's not reckless and a helmet is a safety precaution which saves lives.

1) He did one of the worst things you could do as far as OPSEC is concerned, he indiscriminately leaked thousands documents to a foreign stranger without knowing what he was releasing. He just leaked everything he could for some yet unexplained reason. We all know the contents now and we are glad he released them, but from a military standpoint he broke a very serious law and could have endangered people's lives through his reckless actions. Given how high profile the crime (and media coverage) was, keeping him confined in a unit separate from others makes sense. They probably wanted to put the heat on him to find out why he was leaking documents at random to untrustworthy sources, this is known as treason amongst other things and is taken very seriously by the army.

"c3md0f3","I had an entire campaign written up for Call of Cthulhu like this, but it never got ran.

From my own planning, I would suggest that you have some way of keeping the survivors in one area.  Think of Lost(If you've seen it), most of the people were afraid to go too deep into the forest because there was the big mysterious monster in the forest. This will keep your players from exploring everything within two days/sessions. It becomes a lot less 'survivaly' if the players are aware of where all the resources are on the island, and can exploit them within days of being there.

Once you have something that puts the fear into the players, and prevents them from exploring further(whether it be supernatural or natural threats), give them reasons to explore where you want them to explore.  Perhaps an NPC goes missing. Someone's child is usually best as there is a more urgency to finding them(As opposed to an adult who your players might say 'Screw that guy, shouldn't have walked off alone').  You also have a parent to pressure the players into finding their child. Another could be food source. Perhaps the bore that they are hunting are starting to move farther and farther away from them. Then there is always the 'Reckless, but useful' NPC that has, despite previous warnings, explored parts of the island and has seen something useful to the group(Perhaps someone is sick, and said NPC has seen an herb deep in the forest that is useful for healing the sick person).

Let them fish, but don't let fish be as 'filling' or 'healthy' as a bore. This isn't just logical(Little fish can't compare to a big bore), but will help you with previously stated adventure hooks. They won't care about following the bore to their new living grounds if the fish will suffice for food.",1327989113,"then there is always the 'reckless, but useful' npc that has, despite previous warnings, explored parts of the island and has seen something useful to the group(perhaps someone is sick, and said npc has seen an herb deep in the forest that is useful for healing the sick person).","reckless, but useful","reckless","but",TRUE,"reckless , but useful","useful",NA,NA,1

"c36i79e","DUI actually has been litigated challenging it's application as a strict liability crime, and the supreme court has ruled on it. What has happened, and how the wording gets around it, is that a DUI is not a crime defined by driving while intoxicated any longer. The actual crime, in practice, is being in control of a motor vehicle with alcohol in your system as measured by a proven inaccurate device. if the prosecution actually had to prove impairment nobody would ever be convicted for DUI, but they only have to prove that a breathalyzer, taken often without consent or probable cause, said alcohol was present. That definition has changed over the years from the original definition of DUI which was driving while intoxicated. I wish I had the source, and I will try to find it, but a DUI attorney wrote a thesis on the history of DUI laws, specifically focusing on the ridiculous nature of the supreme court rulings in relation to strict liability that is fantastic. It cites each supreme, and appellate court, judgment and describes how MADD has created a new industry centered around a law which doesn't actually come close to punishing those who were first targeted by the statute. 

And let me be clear, I am no supporter of driving drunk, it's dangerous and reckless, but a BAC of 0.08 is not by any reasonable medical definition drunk, reckless or dangerous. I am vehemently against the DUI industry which has been created to make money by punishing common behavior that presents no harm to society, based on faulty statistics and anecdotes, and that money is driven into writing laws which are more inclusive and create more cattle to feed the system. I say this as a drug and alcohol counselor with great training and experience in how alcohol affects the body, having worked in a DUI counseling center which is just another mechanism to fine people who present no threat and are not addicts. There is better technology than the breathalyzer, which is not even remotely accurate and doesn't even measure BAC as the public believes it to, but the system fights it because more accurate measurements of impairment would drastically reduce DUI prosecutions.

It is straightforward to measure the calories burned _during_ exercise in the laboratory by measuring oxygen consumption: fifteen minutes on the treadmill consumes this many liters of oxygen, therefore this many calories.  The problem is, your basic metabolism will be consuming oxygen while you are on the treadmill, so the total consumption is the _sum_ of your BMR and the treadmill effort.
* * Your estimate for calories burned by running is high
* Your BMR is lower than you think.  BMR varies enough between individuals with the same age, sex, height, and weight that a weight-loss diet for one is a weight-gain diet for another.

It's very easy to say that when you don't even try to understand the concepts. Here is an incomplete and probably at least partially inaccurate nutshell for anyone interested;

I'll agree, the first field trials of GM crops were irresponsible and reckless, but not because of scientists. Big business dictated where the research went because they were the only ones funding it properly. These people were more interested in short term yield gains than anything else, so the first trials were of crop species with herbicide or insect resistance genes. The advantage to the farmers was that they could spray a shit ton of BASTA or glyphosate to eliminate any competing weeds in their fields. Obviously, if these genes ""escaped"" into natural relatives of crop species it would be a nightmare, because they would have an advantage and outcompete other wild species (We're assuming evolution is a fact, if you disagree, go [here](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ENqWpkfOEBU/TgoP7q9LoGI/AAAAAAAAGQY/bjnK4oevj7M/s1600/You+shall+deal+with+it.jpg). Greenpeace and others sensibly (IMO) called for an end to it, and when they were told to piss off, got angry and ruined some fields. It wasn't the right thing to do (again IMO) but it raised the awareness that was at least part of the reason those projects were shelved.

Now wiggle your fingers in front of your face to simulate time passing.

Excellent, here we are. Modern GM research is much less focused on short term goals like yield gain. This is probably because we have realised that, in the short term, GM crops are not going to be widely accepted by the public or by politicians. Gene transfer into wild plant populations is a genuine concern, and enormous effort goes into [preventing it](http://www.plantphysiol.org/content/132/4/1770.full). The finished products go through testing that even the most vicious chemotherapy drugs only dream about. But Greenpeace and other pressure groups seem to see scientists as a group of mad Dr. Frankensteins with god complexes and a deep will to destroy the planet. They flatly refuse to even look at the improvements in environmental safety that have been acheived, and just attempt to stop all research. Well fuck you Greenpeace, there'll be 7bn people in the world soon and they're going to need feeding. Otherwise there'll be a geniune environmental disaster when the only option is destroying sensitive rainforests and savannahs to use as farmland to grow inefficient and wasteful crops.

I'm sorry if all this comes across as a bit angry, and I'm aware that I veered from a story to a rant, but I suppose that's what happens when you have a line of fucking protestors outside, and can't hold the door for someone in case they try to destroy everything you've been working on for years. Knobs. 

tl;dr:- Greenpeace's perception of GM research is out of date, and they don't seem to want to change it.",1311267789,"here is an incomplete and probably at least partially inaccurate nutshell for anyone interested;  i'll agree, the first field trials of gm crops were irresponsible and reckless, but not because of scientists.","irresponsible and reckless","reckless",NA,FALSE,"irresponsible and reckless","irresponsible",NA,NA,0

"c210fx8","&gt;Yet, gotta say, it involves you initiating force against him.

You're just twisting the definitions here in attempt to change the meaning of the NAP. It's really very clearly defined in this circumstance. The slaver is an aggressor, someone who continually uses violence to get their way, so, according to the NAP, violence is a legitimate tool when used against a slaver. The slaver has initiated force, so no one responding to it that force is an initiator.

&gt;How about someone who chooses to drive drunk?

Drunk driving is dangerous and reckless, but, yes, under very few circumstances could it be considered aggression. As for dealing with drunk driving without aggression, the answer depends on a lot of things. It's not really possible to do with the current system of public roads. Public roads are already a violation of the NAP, so the situation is already fudged up.

If roads were privately operated, I would assume road-owner wouldn't want drunk drivers using them -- it's bad for business. Anyone caught driving drunk would probably be banned from driving on many road systems, perhaps until they seek professional help for their alcohol problem. If they continue to drive on the roads anyway, then they're entering the realm of trespass and starting to break the NAP, and the use of force starts to become legitimate.

"c1y5x1r","&gt;Well, there's not many places in the states that have actually had no speed limit. If you want additional data, just look at the German Autobahn, which has far fewer crashes and fatalities than comparable US highways.

There are other places in Europe that have speed limits that are safer than the German highways... The US is more dangerous in general! 

&gt;Only after they were faced with the choice of losing federal funding. And guess what, crashes and fatalities were down with no limits and went back up after the limits were re-instated. Or did you not read the article?

I guess your method of ticketing isn't a great revenue source. Plenty of other states are OK with turning down federal funding for things such as Tolls! 

&gt;It's not just road rage. They feel vindicated in hogging the fast lane because of the speed limit. If the law said they had to yield they would. They are do-gooders after all.

And it doesn't make what the speeders do right, either! 

&gt;It's data. Nobody cooked this stuff up. Autobahn style traffic laws are the safest in the world.

The facts back me up. 

&gt;There will always be people that drive like morons and they should be pulled over and ticketed. I've stated this repeatedly. I'm not sure why I have to repeat again. The point you're really missing though, is that the fast lane ""civilian enforcer"" is one of the worst and most dangerous kinds of moron and our current laws do nothing to penalize or discourage his behavior.

OK, but you seem to be suggesting we don't go after the speeders which is just a pretty stupid idea. 

&gt;There's no reason why this is not possible, especially where I-95 is 4 lanes wide in each direction. If slower traffic stayed to the right, passing was done only on the left, people yielded to faster vehicles, and all of this was actually enforced instead of a speed limit, one could safely go even faster.

In the Megalopolis traffic is heavy. Plus tolls slow you down, too! 

&gt;I've taken I-95 from NYC to Miami and back several times. Each time, I probably averaged 85-90 MPH (meaning I had stretches at 100 MPH+). This equates to a considerable time savings versus doing the ridiculously low speed limit during the whole trip. I never crashed into anything and the only real problem I had was people not getting the fuck out of my way and forcing me to pass on the right.

You should have been ticketed, but plenty of people do that on long trips. Each MPH can take a lot off of your time on long trips! I imagine you're probably white. That can prevent people from getting tickets down in Dixieland, the part of I-95 where driving 100MPH is still illegal and reckless but not as reckless as it would be up north. 

&gt;And I'll make the same point again, safety should still be enforced. I'm not saying every stretch of I-95 is 100 MPH capable. I'm sure some turns would warrant a tap on the breaks. Common sense should be used and enforced. You shouldn't be allowed to cut across 4 lanes at 100 MPH to make your exit. But slapping a 55/65 number on a sign and giving me a ticket for exceeding it, regardless of how safely my vehicle is being operated, is stupid.

So now if a person is caught in a dispute you will want the judge to decide on what is and isn't ""common sense""? That's stupid. There is nothing wrong with just having actual rules on the books. It's a much better alternative to what you'd like us to do!

"c12o8k5","I stop at every light and stop sign on my morning commute. I have seen some awful stuff, but just this morning there were two separate incidents. Both involved people trying to turn right by speeding up, going around me and cutting me off instead of waiting for me to get out of their way. This is the worst thing anyone can do to a cyclist. *If you need to make a right turn and there's a cyclist in front of you, for Christ's sake just let them get out of the way first.*

The first time, a dude on a bike whizzed past me on my left, cut over in front of me, and made a right turn. I had to turn hard right to avoid hitting him, which caused the guy on the bike behind me to crash into me. The guy who caused the wreck stopped, turned around, and came back to check on us. I didn't actually wreck, but the guy behind me slid several feet and was pretty shaken up.

Shaken up, I continued on. A few blocks later, some fat woman in an SUV got right behind me in a right-hand turn lane about 20 feet from the green light. After having one close call, I took the center of the lane and signalled so that she would know I intended to go through the light. Apparently enraged, she swerved out within inches of the car in the lane to her left, roared past me, and nearly hit *another* person who was walking across the street. This stupid, fat woman nearly killed two people. She would've made it through that light just fine without driving like a reckless maniac.

Which one do I hate more? Mr. Fast Cyclist is a douche, but it's hard for me to imagine him killing me with his bike, and I think he made a reckless but honest mistake. On the other hand, Miss Fat SUV Driver seemed to me to be trying to make a point with her terrible driving: She wanted to send me the message that in her mind, I don't belong on the road, and it would not bother her one bit to flatten me with her car. No contest. I had half a mind to follow her and key the shit out of her SUV.

And by the way, these are *not* hypothetical situations I made up to illustrate a point. I commute to work by bike every day and people being idiots around bikes is a daily occurence. Even if you think bikes don't belong on roads (which is not what the law says), do you really think you have a right to endanger the life of another human being? Where are your priorities?

**EDIT** Wow, how did I even get on this topic? I was trying to make some kind of point about blowing red lights but I got so caught up in this post that I forgot to mention it.

"c0pxklt","Congratulations, son! You have what's known as ""critical thinking faculties"". Because of them, you've hit upon a phenomenon known as hypocrisy. Expect to be downvoted ruthlessly for showing society's double-standards. 

Expect to be bombarded with talking-points and pre-packaged ""after-school special"" propaganda. Redditors, as a demographic, aren't particularly deep thinkers. If a Hollywood movie tells them that gender reassignment is ""deep"" or ""sane"" or somehow ""poetic and beautiful,"" they'll buy it hook, line and sinker—unquestioningly.

The TV says it's okay. Therefore it's . . . okay.

What? The TV makes fun of women who want boobjobs? Well, then they'll—with no cognitive dissonance whatsoever—ridicule boob jobs and those who get them.

But the biggest contradiction isn't in saying one form of body dismorphic dysfunction is okay while another isn't; it's in lumping transgendered people in with gays. They're two totally different pathologies.

I stand by quietly amused as Redditors will tell homophobes, ""No one can help being born gay. You have to accept who you are born as!"" But where transgendered people are concerned, they'll spout exactly the opposite advice, ""It's great that you didn't accept who you were born as! It's wonderful how you got into massive debt to modify your body rather than accepting who you were born as!""

Just saw a documentary on transgendered people, too. Their post-op suicide rates are staggering. They build up this procedure, thinking it'll ""make them whole"". Then they get it and realize, ""Shit! Changing my external packaging didn't really address my inner issues like everyone told me it would."" And, in depression and dismay, they kill themselves.

Any Buddhist would tell you why that is: The West is materialistic. It's superficial. Change the outside of something and we think we change the inside. Wrong, wrong, wrong. You have to deal with yourself internally first. Medieval surgery and chemicals aren't the formulas for happiness. But so long as society says it is, you'll see well-meaning Redditors sing the praises of cheap materialism: ""Go get the medieval surgery and chemicals. It'll solve all your underlying issues!""

This says nothing regarding the utter recklessness and idiocy of dosing an individual for life with harsh chemicals that have been linked to cancer. They were giving artificial estrogen to menopausal women and cancer rates jumped up massively. Then they did studies and concluded that hormone drugs are dangerous as hell. (Cancer thrives on estrogen.) Transgendered people are being dosed with the same carcinogenic toxins as given to menopausal women. The difference? Imagine getting the drugs as a 60 year-old, as opposed to a 25 year-old and being expected to subsist on them for decades longer.

My God, how short-sighted and reckless!

But the TV says it's okay, so let the carcinogenic life-long hormone treatments begin!

* On the other end of the spectrum: Women who want to become men and take drugs to suppress naturally-produced estrogen. Female bones are *not* like male bones. They're more porous and require estrogen to maintain bone-strength. By artificially suppressing estrogen in women, you're causing osteoporosis and a slew of other medical maladies.

"c0mhbeg","It seems mredd is right. Your blanket statement was about the Goldstone report, so the document I referred to in my reply to your comment was also the Goldstone report, not this new report.

&gt; the necessity to attack this infrastructure and do it in the way it was done - fully permitted by international law by the way - is explained in this report.

I'm sorry, I must be dense. I have searched through the ""Malam report"" and I can't find any discussion of the **way** in which the IDF attacked. Perhaps if you could point out specific pages, I could better understand what you are saying.

&gt; No. It is very much disputable 
&gt; ... IDF to go in, kill the operatives guarding the tunnel and destroy the tunnel itself, which in turn triggered a rocket barrage by Hamas and subsequent authorization for initiation of Cast Lead.

As far as I can tell, our only point of disagreement is when the ceasefire ended - when Hamas allegedly planned the kidnapping, or when it actually started firing rockets again. To avoid getting lost in semantics, will you allow me to rephrase my statement? ""... by launching its attack, it threw away *the lull in Hamas rocket attacks*, putting Israeli civilians again in danger of Hamas's (illegal, terrorist) attacks"". That expresses my original meaning in a clearer way.

Regardless of whether the IDF's invasion of Gaza was justified by international law, their motivation in launching the attack is an interesting question. If you believe (as you seem to) that it was a purely *tactical* response to a specific threat posed by a specific tunnel, then you must believe one of three things:

- The IDF is stupid. It didn't realize that its attack would trigger Hamas rockets.

- The IDF is reckless. It just didn't care that its attack would trigger Hamas rockets.

- The IDF is both stupid and reckless. It was aware that its attack would trigger Hamas rockets, it didn't want that to happen, but it couldn't think of a way of neutralizing the tunnel without triggering Hamas rockets. I'm hardly a military genius, but I can think of at least three ways to neutralize the threat without entering Gaza.

I have a higher opinion of the IDF than you seem to. I think they are neither stupid nor reckless, but rather, saw a *strategic* advantage in invading Gaza.

"c03j5lp","It's not that the government can't do it.  It can and does to a larger extent than is usually appreciated.  However, if it takes over, it would be very nearly impossible for anyone to independently try to do anything to offer improved or expanded health care.  I'm sure you know that all kinds of alternative medicines are not even allowed the opportunity to prove themselves, much less be offered at the much lower prices at which they could be sold, and are, but never legally under the description of medicine.

Care is denied in part because there are so few permitted to offer it.  The desire to help people is a very natural motivation for humans, yet if you go to any major college in the US the professors of the first few medical courses will tell you they are specifically designed to weed out the vast majority of those who enroll.  Even if you think this is to get rid of people who would not meet a particular standard as doctors, look at the cost of treatment.  Why shouldn't we try allow more to become doctors and see if the lower prices due to the increased supply of doctors is not worth the unknown risk.

If you try to encourage that, I think you'll find you run into the same problem that alternative practitioners so often encounter.  The AMA, state medical boards, HMOs, insurers, and countless other organized leaches have no interest in prices going down.  Doctors, like any business faced with someone else taking their business, don't like this either.  Also like any business, they complain about it.  However, when a doctor complains, it's an ""expert"" that's complaining, and curiously almost anything that makes life tougher for doctors always seems to somehow be dangerous.

The AMA is their voice in DC and their lobbying power rivals that of AIPAC.  You can thank the AMA for establishing price floors in the most expensive industry in the country.

People are hurting and feeling desperate, so libertarian opposition to what seems like *the* solution looks heartless and reckless, but they have opposed the steps that have been making medical care more and more expensive since WWI (not that there were enough of them to be noticed back then).  It drives some of us crazy because the history and the system it produced for us today is so convoluted and hard to generate interest in, at least those of us who have actually sat down and looked into it.

People are angry at a lot of the right people for the price of health care: insurers, drug companies, hospitals that always charge the maximum, they just don't recognize that going  for universal health care is embracing the wildest dreams of those same organizations.
