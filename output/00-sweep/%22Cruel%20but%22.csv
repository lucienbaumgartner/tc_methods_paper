"g33bjs9","1. Yes, there were definitely land owners in these contexts you have mentioned. But the systems of land ownership that existed in ancient Egypt or Greece did not produce the political-economic system of the modern world. The world of 16th century England did, however. The dominant form of political and economic organization today is capitalism, which has its origins in this period. The specific form of land ownership which developed in England at this time and spread to the rest of the world is different from previous forms. Previously in most of Europe, feudal lords owned the land. Peasants farmed the land, and feudal lords took their grain and cattle and used it to feed themselves and their armies, and they also conscripted peasants into service for labor and war. In return, peasants were allowed to use the land in common for their own ends. But the feudal owners had no interest in using the land to generate profit, since there was nothing that could be made by peasants on farmland that anyone else wanted to buy-- the next valley over had the same land and the same peasants. A very complex set of processes began happening in Europe, and especially England, in the 16th century however, in which it suddenly made sense to use land as capital, that is, as a means to produce wealth, rather than just subsistence. This required seizing control of the state, and using it to turn land previously worked in common by peasants, into land held privately, and worked specifically for the purpose of making profits. The bourgeois revolutions in Europe from the 16th-19th century were a conflict between the old feudal order, and the emergent capitalist class. In places like England and France where the capitalist class largely was able to seize control of the state, they used state power to evict peasants en masse from their lands, forcing them into cities where they would have no choice but to sell their labor for scraps in the new factories of the bourgeoisie. This same process has repeated itself all over the globe, and is currently ongoing in parts of Africa and southeast Asia, where traditionally-held lands are being sold off to private business interests, and the people who lived there evicted and forced into cities.


2. No, not pastoral anarchy, fully automated luxury space communism. This process I described goes hand in hand with the development of the modern world, and all the things that come along with it, like modern agriculture, medicine, science, and technology. Marx saw it as a cruel but necessary step toward the development of a society where we could have all those things-- modern life, but where the people who actually do the work, the landless peasants, could control the economic system. None of the 20th century communist countries achieved this, but social change happens in fits and starts. It took nearly 500 years for capitalism to overthrow feudalism and develop to its modern form, so it may take socialism as long.

Labor is definitely limited, as there are a limited number of workers available, and labor itself destroys the worker, under the present economic arrangement. The capitalist has to give something in wages, in order for the worker to be able to reproduce him/herself.

"g3292oa","I think you forgot about one thing: feelings do not make sense.

In reality, in fiction, in life: feelings just don't. So, even though Jellal changed due to circumstance, that doesn't mean Erza would stop feeling for him. In the same sense, why does Levy have feelings for Gajeel? Why did Gray get feelings for Juvia? Why does Juvia love Gray? Sure, it was easily put there by Mashima as the writer, but in real life, feelings don't make sense either.

You could date someone and get to know them as a headstrong, confident boy and, due to circumstance, they start to be aloof and detached, but that doesn't mean your feelings are just going to change - and that's what I think Jerza is.

Erza loves him beyond what happened to him. She even loved him when he was hypnotised because she always loved him. She used to look up to him, admire him, and then he saved her only to become hypnotised and cruel, but that didn't change what she felt or what he had done for her. She hated him because of it, of course, but her hatred was born of the love she had before and the betrayal she felt. And when he came back to being the kindhearted soul that she knew (only dampened by, first, memory loss, and, then, the truth of what he had done under hypnosis) she loved him because she knew it wasn't his choice. Erza even believed that Jellal saved them by sacrificing himself in the Tower of Heaven when nobody else did because, once again, Erza always loved and believed in him. Jerza, I think, is actually Mashima's best romance in Fairy Tail.

And, in the end, Jellal's core values never changed (well, except for in the hypnosis, but even that was a misappropriation of what he wanted). He wanted to help people. Save them. He wanted to let people experience freedom and life and, after the hypnosis, he wanted to save people from the darkness that had stolen from him. Thus, his values remained the same. And that, in and of itself, could be Erza's reason for loving him. It's not about personality and whether he's confident or aloof. It's about whether Jellal has values that she believes in as well.",1598560495,"she used to look up to him, admire him, and then he saved her only to become hypnotised and cruel, but that didn't change what she felt or what he had done for her.","hypnotised and cruel","cruel",NA,FALSE,"hypnotised and cruel","hypnotised",NA,NA,0

"g303psg","The Jojo ending while it's a humorous and light-hearted ending is one of my least favourite endings out there that the story has to offer. I really get how a happy ending could weaken and loosen the impact a story like this can offer I see it in two ways.

1. A happy ending or even just a happy continuation does a good enough job of continuing the story and giving a little bit more depth to Saki's character that wasn't there already, this was a story made in mind to just be a tragedy with a bit of rape involved and see the downward spiral of a person and see that person suffer and die horribly. But I still feel a deep amount of empathy and interest in Saki and would love to know about her a little bit more than just have her be someone that was chewed up and spat out.

2. It alternate endings (not necessarily the Jojo ending) I think demonstrate a rather beautiful way of showing people that yes, in a world like the one Saki had no one loved her and everyone was just horrible and cruel to such a person and in theory I'm fine with showing that message that not everyone is as kind as you'd want them to be. But not always, I think that by continuing or even so much adding a detour of an extension to the story and making another character as a part of the story that really does care demonstrates a little bit more compassion for the audience to care about than we allow ourselves to think about. In a way it's like saying ""The world is evil and the people in it are cruel. But not always, sometimes there are genuinely kind people that are few and far between, and if you can't find one, Go be one"".

I'm not dismissing the notation and the original idea that this story was about abuse, cruelty and suffering and seeing a person go through that beating like that was just an unfortunate situation and I'm not even denying how it ended.

Stories that were made to have really harrowing and depressingly grim have a right to be there and show the world that not everything ends in rainbows and sunshine and I'm absolutely fine with that, showing the people that the world isn't seen through rose coloured glasses gives people a sense of realism.

But at the same time I really love happy endings despite how sappy and schmaltzy they can be at times. A happy ending can be just as impactful as a depressing ending providing you understand that bittersweet tones need to apply as well, cant have one without the other.

So I completely understand where you are coming from that happier endings lessen the blow and the message this was trying to achieve, but in some way or another they give a story like this a new meaning and one that is probably a little bit more inspiring and hopeful.",1598515960,"it alternate endings (not necessarily the jojo ending) i think demonstrate a rather beautiful way of showing people that yes, in a world like the one saki had no one loved her and everyone was just horrible and cruel to such a person and in theory i'm fine with showing that message that not everyone is as kind as you'd want them to be.","horrible and cruel","cruel",NA,FALSE,"just horrible and cruel","horrible",NA,"just",0

And unfortunately my country has a long history, often in partnership with foreign conservation organisations, of forcing communities off their land, fencing it off and then condemning them for poaching when they try to graze of hunt on the same land their forefathers did. Despite the fact that all around the world indigenous groups have a better record of protecting local ecosystems.

I’m not defending the guy in this case, but if you’ve been deprived of the means of supporting yourself, and schools and public services are bad in your area, it’s very easy for you to feel the economic pressure to get into illegal and cruel, but lucrative, sectors like the ivory trade. Would everyone do it? No, my parents grew up poor in Kenya but didn’t become poachers. Are there some alternatives? Probably, although fewer good ones than you might think. There’s a reason that across the world it’s poor, deprived people with few opportunities for economic or social advancement who join gangs and commit property crimes. And I think the solution has to be changing the conditions they face, not saying they’re giving up their humanity and expecting them to accept deprivation with a quiet smile.

"g2rzizl","Great analysis! You’re killing these!

My only push-back or 2 cents has to do with Isayama’s viewpoint towards the characters. I wouldn’t necessarily say his goal is to warn against selfishness in the context of Eren and historia’s actions, nor pit one side as the better of the other. Rather, it comes down to a core theme of this series I’ll expound on later. 

Armins dialogue with Annie is the best example of this moral greyness. In it, he fully relinquishes the idea of being a “good guy”, and knows that like eren he sacrificed lives, betrayed his friends, and hurt innocents in order to maintain his dream of the world outside the walls. It shows armins emotional development as a character, and that although he certainly is a more altruistic character than eren when it comes to selfishness, he also understands the moral grey in his decisions. Eren also realised the moral greyness and complexity of his when he stayed at Marley, and saw the enemy no longer as animals but rather normal people with different ideologies.

Further, I also don’t think isayama fully rejects historia or Eren’s choice to be selfish, but instead sees it as a necessary step in their character development that comes with major consequences for the rest of the world. Historia was also shown as a person that does care for people, for instance helping the orphans as a queen, and eren noticed that when she’s free she’s still naturally wanting to help others. But, for him to be saved and have a reason to love and keep living, historia too sacrificed humanity outside the walls. They made a promise with no regrets to move forward in ending the cycle of hatred caused by Titan domination, but are also inevitably plagued with the guilt of what it cost via the rumbling, and will likely find hope only in their family they make after, born out of love.

Here, both sides are open to Isayama’s critique, but also are both noted as being a result of massive character development.

I think this all boils down to the importance of both perspectives, as well as a core theme this show tries to tell us:

*In this cruel but beautiful world, we must live for ourselves rather than others if we wish to be free, and only through moving forward past the worlds cruelty and accepting ourselves as who we are can we truly start to show kindness towards others.*

This kindness comes through love, not hatred, symbolised in Eren’s child, as well as the alliance’s quest to save the outside world. It comes in showing empathy to the enemy, which both eren and the alliance does.

Characters on both sides have started to understand this. They are’t weak and being nice just for the sake of others liking them, as we see in Krista or Ymir. They embrace who they are, their imperfections, and the guilt of what they are doing, but push past all that pain to keep living. From accepting who they are, they are finally able to truly help others FOR the sake of others, not because they need it for their own self worth. This is important, but comes with consequences. For the alliance, it’s the outside world at the expense of paradis’ future. For eren, it’s paradis, his dreams, and not sacrificing  historia for King Fritz’s ideology at the expense of the outside world. Neither side has a sense of self-righteousness to lean upon, and both’s ideology come with devastating sacrifices, but they still move forward with their actions in light of their human nature. 

As such, this show teaches us to not live for others approval, but to find the confidence in yourself to keep going. You’ll make mistakes, hurt others, and get hurt yourself, but there is hope on the other side of hell. 

In addition, it teaches empathy, and the important idea that the people we see as “bad people” are just like us but with different social circumstances. Rather than seeing some people born as good and some born as bad, showing empathy towards those we see as evil is an important action to end the cycle of hatred and revenge. In this story, the oppressor becomes the oppressed, and the oppressed becomes the oppressor.

Even if they move out etc. the blacklisting stays until 6 months proof of another owner unrelated to the original.

"g2kphd7","Generally speaking, the Lupine threat level is one of the great unknowns of the system. In theory, Lupines are more or less identical with the Garou of Werewolf: The Apocalypse. However, this breaks down at some points and their apparent omnipresence is one of them. In Vampire, Lupines make it actually dangerous to travel the countryside. In Werewolf, the Garou are fighting a war for the survival of the world and their resources and manpower are stretched extremely thin. The pack patrolling a random stretch of road could be used much better to secure a holy site or sabotage an Endron Oil rig or lay siege to a Black Spiral pit. 

Going by that background, the three most likely ways to invite a werewolf attack are a) straying too close to a Caern or holy site where spirits actively monitor the surroundings and alert the Garou defenders, b) stumble into a community of their human relatives, try to snack on someone who knows what's happening and tells their big, furry sisters or c) have extremely bad luck to both meet a werewolf and be in a situation where they actively use an ability to figure out whether something in the vicinity is aligned with the cosmic power of death, decay and corruption. Of course, that risk is cumulative - Just traveling through the countryside via car or motorcycle should really be close to safe . Actually living there means you run those risks every single night, which is not very desirable for a creature hoping to survive for centuries. Also note that the Garou of Werewolf actually have no problem entering cities - most dislike it, but will absolutely do it if their duty commands it.

&amp;#x200B;

That being said, it may be more useful to assume that the Lupines of Vampire are not the same as the Garou of Werewolf. To establish the threat level the Vampire background prefers, they're more numerous when it comes to actually covering the countryside and have an uncanny sense of when leeches trespass in their sprawling territories, likely assisted by their spirit allies.

Also true, but again, not for the reasons you think.

&gt;The left is now saying that a male with a beard is now a woman and yet  at the same time saying that there is really no such thing as female and  male. Gender constructs. Insane.

""The left"" isn't saying this. Science is saying it. The left just happens to be more inclined to accept scientific consensus. Here, I will break it down for you (not really for *you*, because I am 100% certain you are incapable of learning or accepting new information that doesn't confirm your bias, but for others who may not know, and are willing to learn).

&gt;***Transgender women tend to have brain structures that resemble cisgender women, rather than cisgender men***. *Two sexually dimorphic (differing between men and women) areas of the brain are often compared between men and women. The bed nucleus of the stria terminalus (BSTc) and sexually dimorphic nucleus of transgender women are more similar to those of cisgender woman than to those of cisgender men, suggesting that the general brain structure of these women is in keeping with their  gender identity.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*In* [*1995*](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7477289) *and* [*2000*](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10843193)*, two independent teams of researchers decided to examine a region of the  brain called the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BSTc) in trans- and cisgender men and women (Figure 2). The BSTc functions in anxiety,  but is, on average, twice as large and twice as densely populated with  cells in men compared to women. This* ***sexual dimorphism*** *is  pretty robust, and though scientists don’t know why it exists, it  appears to be a good marker of a “male” vs. “female” brain. Thus, these  two studies sought to examine the brains of transgender individuals to  figure out if their brains better resembled their assigned or chosen  sex.*  
&gt;  
&gt;***Interestingly, both teams discovered that male-to-female transgender women had a BSTc more closely resembling that of cisgender women than men in both size and cell density, and that female-to-male transgender men had BSTcs resembling cisgender men***. *These differences remained even after the scientists took into account the fact that many transgender  men and women in their study were taking estrogen and testosterone  during their transition by including cisgender men and women who were  also on hormones not corresponding to their assigned biological sex (for  a variety of medical reasons). These findings have since been confirmed  and corroborated in other studies and other regions of the brain,  including a region of the brain called the* [*sexually dimorphic nucleus*](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18980961) *(Figure 2) that is believed to affect sexual behavior in animals.*

\[[SOURCE - HARVARD UNIVERSITY](http://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/flash/2016/gender-lines-science-transgender-identity/)\]

The science is far from settled on this, but we are making headway, and the working theory based on all available information and many studies is that sex and gender develop independently of one another at separate times during the development of the fetus, and that the development of the gender is not always congruent with the development of the sex. This results in people being born with male or female sexual organs, but brains that more closely resemble the opposite gender. Transitioning is just a way for them to have their bodies match their brains.

I can't guarantee the people in your real life will, because, again, I don't know your situation. But I can guarantee that I will, and the people who've responded in this thread will, and people you might not even know care about you will. And I know it's a bold statement to say I will, because I don't even know you, but goddamn it I mean it. God, it's scary talking to someone who might be dead before the end of next week. The scariest part of this whole thing is that this might never reach you, but I hope it does.

I can't speak for you, and I won't speak for you, but I know in my own thoughts of depression and anxiety my brain overwhelms me with thoughts of my own worthlessness, or how I won't ever do anything worthwhile, or how nobody really truly cares for me. And apathy is a bitch, it truly is, sometimes it's a cruel cycle of putting off my own health and then stressing about it and then all over again. But, what gets me through it is the thought of tomorrow, that no matter how much I think otherwise, no matter who much life fucking sucks and no matter how much I don't think my own life matters. I know that tomorrow is another day, and I've survived so far, and that there are things I want to do before it all ends. That's my WHY, the reason I keep going. And, I hope to everything you find your why.

My misgivings about condemning the journalists in the video out of hand stems from the thought of ‘where do we draw the line?’ 

Having a reporter and camera crew go out because the victim is unreachable, and asking off camera if the victim would like to comment on or off camera is not, in my opinion, so egregious as to immediately damn the journalists. 

Ambushing the victim by waiting for them to leave the house and running up with cameras, yes; that is underhanded and cruel. But from the video I’m willing to give the benefit of the doubt that they were there to seek comment. 

Painting press as bad or evil for covering uncomfortable but newsworthy incidents is a dangerous road to go down. And news should be independent. Yielding to police like in the video makes me think of a more nefarious situation. 

Say the police chief is implicated raping a victim and then coercing then into silence. When reporters show up to get a statement from the victim, the police shame the reporters into backing off of the story. 

That’s my reasoning for why I won’t condemn the reporters out of hand.",1598116185,"ambushing the victim by waiting for them to leave the house and running up with cameras, yes; that is underhanded and cruel.","underhanded and cruel","cruel",NA,FALSE,"underhanded and cruel","underhanded",NA,NA,0

It is not the champion matchup that should lose you the game but rather gameplay and game sense.

Optimize reactive pathing. It's important especially when you play hard carrying jgs such as eve or sylas.
Being able to read the map to safely farm up and carry is key. 

If your team thinks it's faker give'm a big f and greed hard for gold. Those folks won't listen so there is no point in helping them if it doesn't benefit you.

The moment i see an enemy laner lose or fall behind i try to tilt them. Sometimes through skill and sometimes through bm.
Why? Because it is super effective. It's cruel but deadly when you master it (no meme).
This can also have positive effect on your teams mental.
I sometimes even hard camp a lane to tilt an enemy so my laner can recollect his thoughts and get back into the game.

Tilting makes a person less combat effective. Most of the times they start making irrational decisions due to anger.
From there it snowballs untill he essentially is so tilted and punished a lot for his irrational decisions that he becomes free farm.
It's true, i use it a lot. It's cruel but effective.

Last tip (most important i.m.o.) is always think worse case scenario. It will improve your awareness, game sense and mental (it prepares you for the fact that a lot of dia high plat laners think they are faker).

I'll give you an example, recently in newzealand a farm manager was caught abusing his cows to the point they couldn't walk due to swollen legs, he calls it ""educating them"", anyway he was caught in an undercover investigation.

There's so so so much abuse like that in the dairy industry, when you see exposes on it then know that activists just happened to go undercover and film in that farm, that doesn't apply to all farms, many farms they don't even get to film in.


This abuse is very very common and very protected, it's part of the dairy industry, the only one that can do anything about it is you by not supporting and funding it.

Some jobs will offer you 4x10's in which you'll work closer to 12 hours a day, and some will offer you 3x12's, in which case you might as well just bring a cot to work with you. And if you work overnight, forget having *ANY* sort of social life or afternoon enjoyment.

The best I can say is find yourself a hobby you can indulge in that will give you a source of enjoyment and fulfillment. Mine was motorcycles. I bought a used sport bike (don't ever buy new) and learned basic mechanical skills and maintenance. For my wife, it was horses. Or for many folks, it's lovingly doting on their pet(s). 

But if you think you're only gonna work until you're 60, unfortunately, that is *__very__* wrong. Currently, retirement age is 66(?) and it will probably continue to follow past trends and go up as you age, so by the time you get ready to retire, the age will probably be closer to ~75, but even then you'll probably still continue to work until you're like 80.

And just so you know, social security (if you're in the U.S.) will NOT supply you indefinitely until you die. This is the trouble MANY of the elderly have run into where they have essentially outlived their benefits. My grandmother, who lived until she was 102 ran into this problem, as well as many of her friends. So make sure start now and build a 401k or an IRA. Doesn't need to be much, just start at like $50/paycheck and increase that by like $25 a year if you can, but don't do what I did; don't ever stop adding to it. If all you can add is $20/paycheck, add it. By the time you reach retirement age, you'll be SOOO much better off. IRA calculators online can show you what a simple $20/paycheck for 50 years can do for ya.",1595614708,"sorry, i don't mean to be overly cruel, but most jobs are gonna be closer to 9 or 10 hours each day when you factor in breaks, lunch, and arriving early, and being held late bc of customers or cleaning up after a dirty job...","cruel, but most","cruel","but",TRUE,"overly cruel , but most","most","overly",NA,1

"fyjexsb","IMO it is tied with The Witcher 3 for me at the top of that list of games. But I understand where you are coming from, if you're looking for great varied gameplay from a story-focused game then you're going to be sorely disappointed.

IMO the ""you spend half of the game looking for junk"" is like saying ""you spend the entirety of a walking simulator walking"". ""Looking for junk"" is not the part of the experience that is taking center stage in those moments, it's the story progression and character development, the pacing-control so that the game is not all action all the time, which so many games don't know actually worsens the overall experience, as well as a tonal build-up, with you witnessing the ND's particular vision of a ""cruel but beautiful"" post-apocalyptic world, something the first game was also lauded for.

The gameplay comes to the forefront in the combat sections, and and it absolutely shined during these sections for me personally. I found your complaint about ludo-narrative dissonance weird, because the first TLoU was praised precisely for addressing that in a well-thought out manner. This game turns up the gore of the gameplay, and the story definitely keeps up with the darker tone, to the point where I feel that the gameplay was made gorier *in service* of the story, not the other way around.

But I think this game might not be for you, I get the impression that you might be more into games that are not primarily narrative-driven, and count varied gameplay as their strength. I would easily put this game in my top 5, alongside Dark Souls and The Witcher 3.",1595143047,"""looking for junk"" is not the part of the experience that is taking center stage in those moments, it's the story progression and character development, the pacing-control so that the game is not all action all the time, which so many games don't know actually worsens the overall experience, as well as a tonal build-up, with you witnessing the nd's particular vision of a ""cruel but beautiful"" post-apocalyptic world, something the first game was also lauded for.","cruel but beautiful","cruel","but",FALSE,"cruel but beautiful","beautiful",NA,NA,1

Especially in a scenario like this whwre they arent  even personally attacking the players character, but rather pointing out mistakes that they are making.

 Which yes, when new york is literally never resetting, sitting there 4v6 just spamming from a slight distance away, and the 6 up on Chengdu never even attempt to punish them for being out of position, that is bad fundamental overwatch from both sides. That is NY being in a bad position where if they play vs any other decent team then they would be dove upon near instantly and focused down, which than says fhat Chengdu is playing badly because they choose to consistently avoid taking fights they have advantages in, and commit resources at some of the most bizarre and worst times.

So that when the noise died down, the President confined himself to repeating his stern threat to clear the court, and Fetyukovitch, excited and triumphant, continued his speech.)

&gt;""Gentlemen of the jury, you remember that awful night of which so much has been said to-day, when the son got over the fence and stood face to face with the enemy and persecutor who had begotten him. I insist most emphatically it was not for money he ran to his father's house: the charge of robbery is an absurdity, as I proved before. And it was not to murder him he broke into the house, oh, no! If he had had that design he would, at least, have taken the precaution of arming himself beforehand. The brass pestle he caught up instinctively without knowing why he did it. Granted that he deceived his father by tapping at the window, granted that he made his way in- I've said already that I do not for a moment believe that legend, but let it be so, let us suppose it for a moment. Gentlemen, I swear to you by all that's holy, if it had not been his father, but an ordinary enemy, he would, after running through the rooms and satisfying himself that the woman was not there, have made off, post-haste, without doing any harm to his rival. He would have struck him, pushed him away perhaps, nothing more, for he had no thought and no time to spare for that. What he wanted to know was where she was. But his father, his father! The mere sight of the father who had hated him from his childhood, had been his enemy, his persecutor, and now his unnatural rival, was enough! A feeling of hatred came over him involuntarily, irresistibly, clouding his reason. It all surged up in one moment! It was an impulse of madness and insanity, but also an impulse of nature, irresistibly and unconsciously (like everything in nature) avenging the violation of its eternal laws.

&gt;""But the prisoner even then did not murder him- I maintain that, I cry that aloud!- no, he only brandished the pestle in a burst of indignant disgust, not meaning to kill him, not knowing that he would kill him. Had he not had this fatal pestle in his hand, he would have only knocked his father down perhaps, but would not have killed him. As he ran away, he did not know whether he had killed the old man. Such a murder is not a murder. Such a murder is not a parricide. No, the murder of such a father cannot be called parricide. Such a murder can only be reckoned parricide by prejudice.
""But I appeal to you again and again from the depths of my soul; did this murder actually take place? Gentlemen of the jury, if we convict and punish him, he will say to himself: 'These people have done nothing for my bringing up, for my education, nothing to improve my lot, nothing to make me better, nothing to make me a man. These people have not given me to eat and to drink, have not visited me in prison and nakedness, and here they have sent me to penal servitude. I am quits, I owe them nothing now, and owe no one anything for ever. They are wicked and I will be wicked. They are cruel and I will be cruel.' That is what he will say, gentlemen of the jury. And I swear, by finding him guilty you will only make it easier for him: you will ease his conscience, he will curse the blood he has shed and will not regret it. At the same time you will destroy in him the possibility of becoming a new man, for he will remain in his wickedness and blindness all his life.

&gt;""But do you want to punish him fearfully, terribly, with the most awful punishment that could be imagined, and at the same time to save him and regenerate his soul? If so, overwhelm him with your mercy! You will see, you will hear how he will tremble and be horror-struck. 'How can I endure this mercy? How can I endure so much love? Am I worthy of it?' That's what he will exclaim.
""Oh, I know, I know that heart, that wild but grateful heart, gentlemen of the jury! It will bow before your mercy; it thirsts for a great and loving action, it will melt and mount upwards. There are souls which, in their limitation, blame the whole world. But subdue such a soul with mercy, show it love, and it will curse its past, for there are many good impulses in it. Such a heart will expand and see that God is merciful and that men are good and just. He will be horror-stricken; he will be crushed by remorse and the vast obligation laid upon him henceforth. And he will not say then, 'I am quits,' but will say, 'I am guilty in the sight of all men and am more unworthy than all.' With tears of penitence and poignant, tender anguish, he will exclaim: 'Others are better than I, they wanted to save me, not to ruin me!' Oh, this act of mercy is so easy for you, for in the absence of anything like real evidence it will be too awful for you to pronounce: 'Yes, he is guilty.'
""Better acquit ten guilty men than punish one innocent man! Do you hear, do you hear that majestic voice from the past century of our glorious history?

Let other nations think of retribution and the letter of the law, we will cling to the spirit and the meaning- the salvation and the reformation of the lost.

"fuykts8","&gt;\&gt; Hmm. But I find it hard to take anything after S5 seriously. The execution was so poor.

So why do you take Sansa/Ramsay's death and Arya's actions ""seriously"" despite them being post-Season 4, but refuse to do so in regards to Dany's actions? Seems a bit hypocritical.

&gt;\&gt; Context matters.

Mostly I was pointing out that these are also shown as ""badass moments"" for Dany, but yes, context absolutely does matter. And while context certainly matters, it doesn't give her carte blanche to treat her enemies in a ""crossing the line"" manner any more than, say, Ramsay with Theon.  

No one claims *""well, Theon deserved what he got, so therefore Ramsay's actions can't be considered immoral or a touch psychotic""*, but people like to parrot this exact sentiment in regards to Dany. Yes, they are miles apart in severity, but the principle is the same. 

&gt;\&gt; Questionable. See, it is kind of ironic when she gives orders to kill all the slavers while she herself is holding the whip. The same thing happened when she gained the unsullied army.

And it's just as ironic when Ramsay is fed to the dogs that he prepared for Sansa... or just as ironic as Arya gathering the Freys for a celebration only to massacre them under their roof... yet you seemingly act like those actions should be looked down on, whereas Dany's ironic actions should be excused? 

&gt;\&gt; Collective punishment. It showed while intentions of Dany were good, the method she was using of abolishing slavery were akin to a high-schooler who has little to no about it. He/she just knows ""slavery bad"".

And I would argue that's a fairly apparent red flag. I assume we all know the idiom ""The road to Hell is paved with good intentions"", and I think this was a pretty clear sign that Dany is more interested in seeing heads roll than dispensing some sort of actual justice. She and her Fire and Blood persona want ""an eye for and eye"" more than actually punishing those responsible for the crucifixions... and it should be a cause for concern.  

Yes, her intentions are good – no one is arguing that – but simply having good intentions doesn't magically forgive her from her concerning choices in how she takes action in regards to those intentions. 

&gt;\&gt; That scene in S6? How was that bad? Dany tried to prevent slaver war by acknowledging Tyrion's advice. 

Again, I didn't list those claiming them to all be ""bad""... merely that it's another ""badass Dany"" moment to gauge your take on the myriad of Dany's badass moments. 

That said, asking people to treat with you, then executing most of them because they don't agree to your terms does seem a bit underhanded. Yes, slavers are scum, no doubt, but you have to admit Dany doesn't shy away from blood being shed. 

&gt;\&gt; Ruthless and cruel but justified. (XXD)

Again, never claimed it wasn't justified... merely pointing out it's a ruthless and cruel punishment that seemingly earned Dany ""badass"" points. 

&gt;\&gt; ***Needless*** and cruel but justified. She was given the option to leave but she chose not to. She desperately wanted more people to follow her. She did not want herself to be confined to Dosh Khaleen.

No, this one was NOT justified, as you yourself point out it was COMPLETELY NEEDLESS. Despite having the opportunity to escape, she REFUSED AND CHOSE TO KILL THEM FOR PERSONAL GAIN. 

This had nothing to do about the Dosh Khaleen because she would have escaped and been free from that life. She chose to return and kill them because, as you said it ""She desperately wanted more people to follow her.""

She killed the Khals, who are clones of her beloved ex-husband, because she needed more soldiers. That is NOT ""justified"" in any sense of the word, as executing leaders of a tribe just so their followers will fight for your own goal is simply immoral. 

She appropriates an entire culture to use as sacrificial pawns in her politically-driven war... she takes them from their homeland, where their sacred lands are, just so they could all die outside of Winterfell on her behalf. 

I still find it hard to believe there are people out there that think this was ""OK"" of her, and even defend her actions. Sure, the Khals were immoral warlords, but she executed them simply because she wanted more power/soldiers.  

&gt;\&gt; But the reason show-writers gave was not plausible. That said, it was *cruel* indeed. She should have not killed his son.

Regardless of how extreme Randyll's previously-established xenophobia is, people seem to overlook the message Dany is sending here. 

Dany isn't killing Randyll because he's mean or despicable or even because he made the choice to fight for Dany's enemies: she executes him and Dickon because he refuses to kneel... just like she would have executed ANYONE there who would have refused to kneel. Yes, she kills Randyll, and many viewers blindly cheer that moment simply because they don't like Randyll... but what if it's Jaime and Bronn instead? What if it's that Lannister soldier Arya met earlier who is having a baby and just wants to live on a farm in peace? What if it's fifty soldiers instead of just two? What if none of them bend the knee and she kills them all? 

Dany's message isn't changing across these scenarios, because her message is ""*serve me or die*"", which IS absolutely concerning. 

Sure, no one is crying because Randyll Tarley was killed, but that doesn't magically excuse Dany for her actions simply because ""only Randyll and his son"" were executed. Her *""serve me or die""* message should be a bigger focus here instead of just handwaving it as ""who cares about Randyll and his son?""

&gt;\&gt; That was war. Anyway, that scene was stupid. Dragon fire is not dynamite.

Ha, agreed. Apparently that wall was built with nitroglycerin bricks!

All that said, I'm really just pointing out that Dany does have a long history of violence across her character arc, and Sansa simply does not... which is why I believe these two are judged differently... because as you previously stated, context matters.",1592266530,"yes, slavers are scum, no doubt, but you have to admit dany doesn't shy away from blood being shed.   &gt;\&gt; ruthless and cruel but justified.","ruthless and cruel","cruel",NA,FALSE,"cruel but justified","justified",NA,NA,1
"fuyjwmn","I purposefully chose those words because it was an execution. I don't respect your opinion. The cops were the judge, jury, and executioner. How were they keeping their city safe by shooting this man in the back until he died? What benefit was that to the city? When people drive drunk, they kill people. When people sleep in the back seat because they're drunk and they realized they couldn't drive, we shouldn't punish those people.

"fuyathy","NTA, it sucks but you need to cut ties with your father. My father was the exact same way and I cut him out of my life 10 years ago and once that toxicity was gone I felt 100% better. I’d just text him, or call him and tell him that you’re done. You no longer need nor want a relationship with him. You chose the family you wanted when you left me and my siblings when you met and married Adelaide. I hope her kids are the kids you wanted because those are the only ones you will ever have because you lost me”. 

When I cut my father out I was much harsher. I told him flat out that: “what’s sad is that I don’t feel sad about losing this relationship. I feel completely indifferent and that tells me that there honestly isn’t anything left to salvage in the “parent-son” relationship. Delete my number because I don’t ever want to speak to you ever again and if I were you I’d pray that you never need an organ because I will show up just to laugh in your face and watch your face crumble as you’re told I’m a match, and yet I refuse to give you it”.

It will be incredibly difficult to form a romantic relationship being an awkward late bloomer. I've known dozens of 30+ guys who still to this day have been unable to find a relationship. Maybe a date occasionally but it never amounts to anything. People say the virgin thing doesn't matter but even if you don't admit it they'll know sooner then later. Known a few guys who got close to actually getting laid only to have the lady back out after figuring it out due to not wanting to deal with the baggage of a virgin. Borderline cruel but understandable, I think people like ONS because they're so plentiful and easy to forget, where those who are more mono/committed/whatever put a lot of effort into the whole thing which can be a huge turn off. Its not that those are bad traits, its just not what people are looking for on the average.

The whole incel/nice guy thing is just another way to keep you down, people love attacking below themselves for whatever reasons they have. All you can really do at this point is just work on yourself the best you can and improve your own life. Be that through finances or skill sets/hobbies/whatever gets your rocks off. I'm not saying go full red pill/mgotw/FDS or whatever trendy shit people go on about but a skim of those ideologies might make a light bulb go off. See if you really wanna play the games or just life a comfy life alone.

If you really want to build relationships you need to get out of your parents house, no matter how much you help around the house, pay rent, help ma and pa, you will always look like a manchild/peter pan syndrome. Its one of the biggest giveaways for LVMs. Try to meet people like you locally and go from there but expect nothing. Its probably best to become content with being alone now then in 10-25 years when/if you're still alone. Making peace with it is pretty much the only thing that will keep you sane. Its hard to not feel lonely and broken but we gotta do what we gotta do.

I know it’s very hard for people to be able to cut off their family or really put up serious boundaries, no matter how unhappy they are.

Unfortunately, the first paragraph is what I have done all my life to “keep up the relationship” and “respect my mother/family.” I’ve been through a lot of that sort of manipulation and mind control from my whole family (I’m the youngest). Many times my family was wrong and cruel, but I was expected to apologize every time because “that’s what family does.” I moved to another state, rarely see them, and call once in awhile just trying to keep the relationship “normal.” It wasn’t until my experience recently that I seriously was able to put my foot down because it really did affect my health.

In a long nutshell... My mom and family were pressuring us to have kids for awhile.... After trying and failing for years, my husband and I have been suffering from multiple IVF disappointments, and my mom told me that maybe I’m not being blessed with a baby because I don’t go to church regularly, pray, or read the Bible regularly. I was so hurt and upset, and she did apologize and I tried to let it go (what I always do). Then my husband had been diagnosed with an unknown rare spinal issue, and had to do an emergency surgery. I told her it went really well, and she couldn’t stop going on about how could I have married a guy like him, how could I have chosen him our of all the guys out there, and that we should just forget about having kids and get life insurance because he’s probably going to die. She also got angry at me because I was upset and raised my voice, and she yelled “I don’t want to talk to you anymore!” So I hung up and haven’t answered their phone calls ever since.

I am willing to text or email if they need something, but other than that I decided I didn’t want to talk, face time or visit with them. The coronavirus actually came at a time where I gladly didn’t need to visit them or them visit me.

Sorry this is so long... I just understand how some people may still want to keep up a relationship with their family, and how hard it is to make the decision to do something about it.

"ftkk870","A character of mine by the name of Kai unintentionally creates a religious schism a few hundred years later. His people the Kaberkorta are extremely zealous, warlike and cruel but Kai was raised in a foreign land called Midil and was not taught any of this.

Instead he showed basic kindness by helping other warriors during a ritual test where it's supposed to be every man for himself, he shockingly spared his opponent during his initiation duel when normally you are supposed to kill them. His continued practices of kindness and mercy irked many and he earned the nickname ""Kai Cleansword"" due his reluctance to kill.

Kai would eventually have to leave the Kaberkorta homeland of Kabekori, a controversial act which led to him being challenged by the leader his clan, somehow he was able to best him despite being less experienced and naturally spared his life.  This sent ripples through out the rest of the clan and Kaberkorta society as the Kaberkorta highly respect martial prowess and have an almost might makes right"" attitude. The idea being that ""If he was victorious, surely that means he has divine favour?""

Kai would then leave but his ideas lingered, over the next few decades more and more would whisper and talk of this peculiar warrior supposedly favoured by god and centuries later mere rambles and religious debate turned into a full blown revolt in the name of ""Kai'ism"" or ""The Way of Kai""

Naturally as the tale of Kai passed over the centuries some details were lost and some fiction was injected, Kai was seen as a holy figure, perhaps a demi-god sent from above to pass down news of great change in the holy tenants.

As well as causing great social and religious change, the schism also saved the continent of Midil as it was being invading by the Kaberkorta at the time and the schism greatly disrupted their invasion plans.

"fs9w6qf","Lets be honest, things have been bubbling underneath the surface that were just waiting to boil over. Its not like police brutality came overnight and its not like this is the first president to be racist and cruel. But i think folks are finally starting to notice that for decades, their lives have not materially improved. For all of the talk of ""stock market success"" and low unemployment, actual everyday americans arent experiencing any of that. Costs are growing, wages are stagnating and real progress has been sitting on the shelf for years. Americans have been going about their lives pretending that things are fine for decades now. It takes something drastic to really wake them up and make them realize how truly fucked the situation is. I know its controversial, but i still hold that trump has done more to expose the ugly truth of our democracy, country and society than nearly anyone in the past 50 years.

"fro8l6i","I take many medications but they are for mostly related, but not exaxtly BPD symptoms. I have been on so many medications but at the moment I’m on Rophynol and Belsomra for depression induced insomnia, klonopin for my anxiety attacks, and Straterra for mood and adhd. 

I do DBT therapy every week (DBT was made specifically for BPD) and that is my main source of treating my symptoms. I realize myself hurting people around me sometimes but I can’t help it. It’s like of like soldiers who have PTSD, and have flashbacks that cause them to yell or act inappropriately. We had some trauma usually while growing up that left scars on our hearts. When something happens we take it personally. 

It seems narcissistic on the outside but we feel like the world revolves around us. But in all the wrong ways. I feel like people do or say things to hurt me when in reality they aren’t even thinking about me at all. 

An example, my wife had a zoom call with her Kimono class. She asked me to leave the room while she had her meeting. Totally reasonable right? 

In my mind, I feel like, “I’m unwanted here.. I can’t believe it.. I’ve put so much into our relationship and now I’m burdening her with my mere existence?? I’m sooo sorry that me being in the same room as you might ruin your call. “ 

It’s because in my childhood I was often made to feel like I was unwanted. My parent made it very clear that I was an unplanned pregnancy that kept her from going to college or pursuing her life. When my SO asked me something so innocuous, my heart had an emotional flashback to the moments in my life that made me feel that way and I overreact. It’s a self preservation response. It’s really unfortunate for everyone involved. 

I think all BPD people want to be loved and accepted because they were abandoned/rejected/invalidated when they were helpless. It’s that overreaction to try to meet a need that was unfulfilled that keeps them from ever finding it. I hope that she is finding help if she has BPD and I’m sorry that her mental illness affected you as well.

"foobdp8","I’ll briefly hit you with some things that helped me about these very same things and I’m willing to expand more. 

But as far as the the difference between the OT description of God and NT; it requires much faith in God and an understanding that not only does he know all things, but that God is good. There is nothing that he does not consider. And in today’s world we have been primed to think that any act of violence is cruel. But when God ordered the destruction of entire nations, it may have been because God knew what those children would grow up to be or the amount of damage that could have been done if they had been allowed to continue living. Imagine the burden of having to care for an entire nation of children that would soon grow up with a chip on their shoulder and rebel against the nation. Some of these nations did horrible things; they were violent and cruel, and had taught their children these same things.

I think it’s good to realize that the Bible was written in a different time, and different people in mind. And though I believe the entire Bible to be inspired, I also think it’s entirely possible that some stories may be more symbolic in nature than we believe.

When it comes to polygamy, times have definitely changed. It seems as though God allowed certain things to happen because he knew the very nature of man. He probably didn’t make rules about polygamy because in all honestly, it might’ve worked out sometimes in the society or time. I don’t believe at any point that was actually his purpose, or that he wanted that to be the case. After all, he made Eve as the only mate for Adam. God maybe did not rebuke people for this act, but there are some acts that he does not rebuke us for today that many people back then did not even have to worry about. God is merciful to the greatest extent and only wants what is best for us. I understand your frustration with your conscience because I’ve felt the same way too. But just understand that if God was that merciful towards these men, he will also be forgiving with us too. That should actually bring us much joy.

And just like you, I read these stories of old prophets and heroes and think the same things. But here’s the secret. The Bible is just the sampler platter. We all have our own story. And our story has not been written entirely yet. There may still be time for that heroic act. The greatest act of living and dying for the truth is incredibly heroic. As Paul said, we have a battle not against flesh and blood, but against wicked spirit forces. These wicked spirit forces are very much alive in this world and waging war with us daily. I’m no Samuel, or Jeremiah, or Elijah; but Hebrews 11 says that we can be counted alongside these types of heroes through our faith.

Like I said; I’ve struggled for a long time with pretty much everything you posted about. But when I drew my attention almost solely toward my faith in Jesus Christ as the Son of God, many things became unlocked in my understanding.

While this should be the case, it very often isn't. Getting a promotion often involves more proficiency with office politics than actually being good for the job. See both [Peter Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_principle) and [This](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-46608818) wonderful piece of research.

Why not give people a stake in the company they're a part of? It incentivises them to make more money for the business because it means more money for them. What are your counter arguments for that?

&gt; I am dubious with UBI. Most (recent successful) UBI study are in small scale and short term. This is not how economic models are formed, hence micro and macro economics are two separate field. Until a large enough economy have experimented it for a long period of time, nether one of us can say for certain the social-economical outcome will be.

I agree, so what better time to test it than in a time where most people are struggling to earn income because of a pandemic and businesses have little demand because people's incomes are suffering? Now is the perfect time to be world leaders and try something bold and new as an experiment.

&gt; I like this idea, a lot of companies, especially start up, are paying their staff in shares instead of a fix salary. It is all nice and well when economy are doing well and the company is growing. However have you consider what will happen when the economy is on a downturn or bad management decision, to no fault of the worker? The company could be bleeding value day by day, and the share you hold will basically be completely worthless, while you still have to grind 12-15 hours day. The most recent example will be WeWork, when your company value drops by 90%, would you take a 90% paycut for the same work? Friend of mine used to work for them and I was told it was the worst decision ever. Not every business is a successful business, for every one that made it, hundreds failed.

No, to your question, because my suggestion wouldn't be to ONLY pay people in shares. Everyone would own a part of the business AND negotiate their wages. What proportion is owned by workers and how much each worker gets individually is all up for debate, of course, but there's no reason not to give people an incentive to do more than just work for minimum wage.

&gt; I agree Amazon should pay their employee more and empower them, but not through UBI handout, but rather through regulations, tax and subsidies to encourage competitors with a better business model to compete with them. For example, subsidies Richer Sound into a billion £ business so they could employ more people with better pay, by tax the living shit out of Amazon et al. IMO this is economically more sustainable than giving everyone a basic income.

That doesn't really offer a long term solution though. You're artificially creating competition instead of letting the market do it. Who decides who gets subsidies? Can anyone? To what tune?

I'd much prefer to have a bunch of partially-worker-owned businesses whose workers are all going to work every day knowing that they'll get enough to live a very basic life on from the Government but also that they more they contribute to the business and the more it succeeds, the more money they can make to spend on luxuries.

I do think there are huge issues with how you afford UBI. Even at my best estimates of eliminating all welfare spending, etc... we're still a bit short. But there's no telling how much extra tax all these people and wage rises would bring it, either.

I agree we need more evidence but we won't get any evidence until someone trials it. And, even then, as you said not every business succeeds and not every country will try UBI in the same way.

&gt; A. Implement UBI so that businesses have to pay fairly if they want people to do shitty jobs (and not just work those job out of necessity). 

I am dubious with UBI. Most (recent successful) UBI study are in small scale and short term. This is not how economic models are formed, hence micro and macro economics are two separate field.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; B. Encourage and incentivise worker-owned companies. The logic behind this is that the more the company makes, the more you make. Which is in stark contrast to being paid a set salary where you get the same money regardless of the quality of your work or company profitability. 

I like this idea, a lot of companies, especially start up, are paying their staff in shares instead of a fix salary. It is all nice and well when economy are doing well and the company is growing.

&gt; But let's look at how many employees Amazon would lose overnight if suddenly people didn't need to work 16 hour shifts in a warehouse to pay the rent?

"fmfgcyb","Here’s the thing: we are all guilty of this. Not the voicing of it or shaming. But the feeling of superiority. 

But it’s not entirely bad. It’s actually essential to our survival. Our entire world is based on being rewarded by being better. Being better than someone actually releases endorphins. It’s why people try and do anything worth doing. Because it makes them happy. 

Imagine it wasn’t this way? Seriously picture what it would be like if failing made you just as happy as succeeding. It would be a disaster. Maybe it’s unfair and cruel. But it’s necessary. I’m thin. If being thin didn’t make me feel better than people that aren’t thin, I would just eat whatever I want whenever I want. What would be the point in trying? 

I’m not saying that I consciously think that I’m better because I’m thinner. It’s just this feeling that’s there. You can’t help it. Same with my career. I just work hard at what I do because that’s just what you do. But now that I’m successful I feel better about myself. I’m a humble person so I don’t think I’m better than anyone else. But that’s because I spent years training myself to be humble and think that way. It’s not a natural state. 

So there are people that aren’t humble, and will even voice these feelings. But we all have them. If anyone thinks they don’t feel superior over someone else about something, they’re in denial. If it’s not physical appearance it’s something else. No one is immune. 

This isn’t anything I’ve ever actually thought about until I saw this post. It’s just something that is.

&amp;nbsp;


Another week goes by without us making substantial progress. My fault. 

I am, at least, almost done with what I promised last week – that is, completing an answer on Mussolini's transition “from socialism to nationalism”. [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/fmct4s/is_there_truth_to_the_criticism_of_benito/fmeahk8/), if you are interested, the third “chapter”. 

As for this week, while I was going through some old stuff for the answer above, I had a chance to revisit a work of the old days, an essay-program composed during the first half of 1918 by FIAT owner Giovanni Agnelli and economist Attilio Cabiati – which, surprisingly (?), appears to have been reprinted many times over the years – under the title “European Federation or League of Nations?”. The publication, which is otherwise more significant as a representation of a contemporary climate when a “democratic” conceit of the war appeared for a few weeks destined to find its affirmation over the “national” idea of the war, went with an extensive, and sympathetic albeit somewhat dubitative (the general climate had certainly changed by the time of publication, soon after the war), review by Luigi Einaudi. 

This, in turn, reminded me that we are perfectly on schedule – rather, two weeks early – for the publication of another opinion piece by Einaudi (April 20^th 1920 - “Towards the City of God”); this time, a commentary on the contemporary work of philosopher Giuseppe Rensi, whose lectures in Genoa were to result in the publication of his “Philosophy of Authority” in June 1920. In it, Rensi drove from the observation of the conflictual and violent character of contemporary society and politics, as well as from the decisive experience of the conflict, to reach a substantial rejection of both idealism (in its traditional Italian formulation) and rationalism, in so far as positing a unitary and “universal” principle, arguing instead the existence of an irreducible “pluriversality” of which the conflictual behaviors, formations and instances of humankind were manifestations. On these grounds, Rensi's skepticism and irrationalism resulted in the affirmation of force as the one source of authority – something which didn't prevent Rensi from distancing himself and eventually becoming an opposer of the Fascist Regime (this shouldn't really be a surprise given the almost obvious “anti-totalitarian” imprint of his skepticism). 


&gt; What is the rationale of a political constitution? – asked Rensi in his introduction – and what is the rational solution of political problems?

&gt; That nothing within the field of political life is accomplished by act of force, by mere imposition, by means of *imperium*; hence that no deliberation is made, of which those who are subject to it don't acknowledge and accept the reason; that any deliberation is, therefore, effective by means of willful consent, approval, request. 

&gt; If anything is imposed and effected by means of mere force, which is to say by means of a command which is to be executed in so far as it has force at its side, but which people observe only because they fear that force at its side, while recognizing it as an arbitrary imposition, then we are in the presence of something violent and undiscerning, of a matter of brute force, that is of a matter which is, in its essential terms, irrational. 

&gt; It is therefore necessary, in order for this irrationality to be removed, for there to be identity between what individual reason deems right, and therefore wishes, and what the law or the State deem right, and therefore command. […] 


Rationalism and idealism had been the main proponents of this conceit; liberalism had then adapted it to political grounds, with its plebiscites, self-determination and universal suffrage. Now, the new political forces had brought it to its extreme consequences.

&gt; […] Contemporary revolutionarism drives its original impulse from the aspiration of, not only transposing, but realizing that concept on practical grounds. […] If the social and political world is yet […] to be perfectly resolved in elements of reason, it may very well happen tomorrow; tomorrow […] one will be able to take care of all human matters in a perfectly rational way; if irrational, undiscerning elements still remain today, one last effort, one last change and they'll be removed, and rationality will penetrate, even in its the deepest recesses and forever, this grand city of humankind which will then becom the *City of God* of reason and justice. […] 


&gt; It is indeed contemporary revolutionarism which, while having as its original purpose the actuation of such perfect rationality, which is to say the total and definitive coincidence of individual will with the will of the law and the State, […] brings such a conceit to its explicit and practical self-negation, to that self-reduction to absurd which, already in principle and in abstract terms, has mortally contaminated it. […] 


&gt; As much as reality in general is far from reducible to reason or spirit – Rensi concluded – so is human reality. Irrational elements […] are and will continue to be fundamental in the formation of social and political associations. And the request that the latter may be, or become, composed entirely of rational elements […] leads to nothing else but the complete uprooting of the social association itself. 


&amp;nbsp;


On April 20^th – amidst an increasingly contentious political climate – economist Luigi Einaudi penned a rejection of a contemporary piece from Rensi (*La bestia bionda* - which, to be clear, is not the one above, even if it must have shared substantial similarities), where the author, somewhat polemically (Rensi had substantially distanced himself from the socialist movement since the early Century), asked whether it was better to resist the socialist advance or to let them win. It is likely that Einaudi – had he had a chance to examine Rensi's subsequent works – would have read Rensi's piece somewhat differently, as the two appear to agree on certain points more than one would expect given the premise. 

Nonetheless, this is one of those pieces I am especially fond of. It is, certainly, representative of its time, and therefore probably deserving of a more detailed commentary than the one I can provide now. But what always strikes me, is the fact that every time I revisit it, it seems to be telling something slightly different, like executions of the same score. 


&gt; The piece which Giuseppe Rensi titles after the “gold haired beast” is a passionate, anguished outburst of someone who feels lost in the disorder, in the anarchy, amidst the current convulsive madness of all and everything. We want order; we want uniformity, commands, one idea for everyone to obey […] The bourgeoisie seems incapable of recreating some discipline […] Let's then leave the way to the proletariat, ignorant and cruel, but resolute in the affirmation of its ideal, to murder as many as it is necessary for every ideal to vanish and its own to remain alone, dominant, to give men what they most need: one authority, one discipline, one religion, for it to give society a true and living unity.

&gt; Giuseppe Rensi wrote […] a true hymn to force, which unifies, does away with doubt and leads the way. His hymn answers to a need of human soul, which shies away from conflicts, from clashes of men, of parties, of ideas, and wishes for tranquility, concordance, unity, even if obtained with blood and iron.


&gt; If I were able, I'd like to write an hymn […] to discord, to struggle, to disunion of spirits. Why should we have as an ideal to think and act the same? Why exalt proletariat, ignorant and cruel, which doesn't argue but demands? Which calls for something it doesn't know and calls more strongly the less it knows the goal it aspires to? What substantial reason is there for the State to have one ideal of its own […] for men to be compelled to adhere to it? Why one religion instead of many? Why one political or social or spiritual opinion instead of infinite ones?

&gt; Beauty, perfection, are not uniformity, not unity, but variety and contrast.

&gt; Those who complain about our current spiritual disarray and wish for a new order don't know how to read inside themselves, bewail what they love, suffer what gives them life. The aspiration to unity, to the empire of one, is an empty dream, it's the aspiration of one who holds to an idea, pursues one ideal of life, and wishes for everyone else to hold to the same idea and long for the same ideal. There is one thing they can't see: that the beauty of their ideal comes from the contrast of it with every other ideal, which he deems worse […] If everyone accepted it, his ideal would be dead. […] 


&gt; The disorderly, labored, anti-unitary, ill-disciplined life we live may appear insufferable to us, who experience its painful individual, economical and moral consequences. It will look magnificent to future generations, who are going to enjoy the fruits of the political, economical and moral truths which our present conflicts will lead to triumph.

Title: The Fall of Sin

Author: Bella J

Genre: Dark Romance

Publication Date: May 13th, 2020

&amp;#x200B;

Mila

Secrets. Lies. Deception.

It’s all part of his vendetta, and so am I. He stole me, used me as one of his pawns by forcing me into a marriage I wanted no part of. I had to sign my name on the dotted line, and now he owns me…body, mind, and soul.

That’s why I ran. I had to escape the monster whose touch corrupted me. Break free from the man who seduced me, the beast who gave me a taste of the darkness.

But now I crave it. I need it. I need him.

I’m his to play with…until I break.

Saint

Distraction. Addictive. Toxic.

Mila wasn’t supposed to be anything more than a signature, a beautiful secret, a wife with no voice. Instead, she became an addiction, a complication that could cost me everything—a price I wasn’t willing to pay…until she ran from me.

Now, the game has changed, and the stakes are much higher. She thinks she’s seen the worst of me, convinced I couldn’t be more vicious and cruel. But I’m about to prove her wrong because I’ll risk everything to get what I want.

Revenge…and my wife.

"fmegxr0","I really don't understand why everyone has such a hard time knowing where to draw the line.  It's simple.

If they're so disabled that they can't feed themselves, need diapers, can't breathe on their own and basically need constant supervision just to keep them alive, then they're a drain on society and should be euthanized.  

You can call be heartless and cruel, but can you deny that I'm right?  What value does a person that's essentially a useless hunk of flesh bring to society or the lives of those around them?  

I remember reading a story on r/confessions about a woman that put her vegetative son into a permanent care facility so that she could forget that he ever existed.  Her family's lives were not made better by the birth of their vegetable son - they were made worse.  So much worse.  The father worked himself so hard to try and support the son's expensive care, and became so disheartened by the lack of any progress, that he became suicidal and died in a work related accident (the author believes it was suicide designed to look like an accident so that the family could be compensated).  Their other son was miserable at all of the attention that was being put into the vegetable that he felt severally neglected, not to mention that he lost his father.  He was hurting and suffering at the strain his family was under so the author finally couldn't take it anymore and put the vegetable in the care facility so she and her son could heal.

The family was not ""blessed"" or enriched by the existence of their vegetative son/brother.  They would've been so much better off if he'd never been born.  There are many stories like this, but everyone has to act like taking care of a vegetable is ""rewarding"" or else society - usually people that have never had to live a day in their shoes - will ostracize them.  

I say it's way passed time that we stop acting like caring for vegetables is anything other than what is actually is - a waste of resources and a drain on families/caregivers.  The world will be a better place if we stop pretending that there's some magical element to it.

It's an emotion unfamiliar to most of my kind. We don't make bonds lightly. Other dragons, when not mating, are greedy and cruel, and I would care not to have anything to do with them. Most hide themselves away, content to hunt when required and counting their coins when not.

Humans are almost as bad, their avarice and malice only limited by short lives full of fury and strife.

And yet I weep for my humans of the village. My scorching wrath wouldn't bring them back, even as I burnt the last of the raiders to dust and ash. The greatest of the buildings reduced to cinders. My friends, gone.

I flew once more over the smoking remains, but nothing moved under my watchful gaze. I try to hold back the tears that well, but they fall as I fly home.

&amp;#x200B;

As I sit among my finery and richest, I wonder if my wisdom was flawed. Many of my cousins have been laid low by organised armies wielding terrible weapons and protected by impregnable armour. I could have wrought the same for my friends, but I refused to. Was I a coward or a fool?

I clearly remember back to the first days. My dominion of the area was clearly known, as their Leader approached me cautiously, unarmed and unarmoured. This piqued my curiosity, and they asked only for permission to settle on the shore that was the edge of my territory. After a small discussion, I agreed, but warned them that any perceived threat would be met with destruction. I could sense the fear in the leader's eyes, the tremble in his voice, but also the desperation. His courage was magnificent as he weighed up the options, and also agreed. What seemed like a small gesture at the time grew into so much more.

The first year went quickly, and they built their village quick but sturdy. I kept watch for any problems, but there were none. Midsummer came, and I was surprised when the leader returned, two wagons laid full with produce, fish and vegetables. I had not known how he knew what I ate, a lucky guess perhaps. He said that the lake was bountiful and the crops grew strong, that this food would go to waste otherwise. I graciously accepted, but I could not take their charity. I showed them various trinkets I had made, jewellery mainly, made with delicate care. He was absolutely amazed, and we traded. The next season they came again, with furs and coats for the colder months. They knew my needs, and I wonder if humans weren't as selfish as I first thought. In a few years, I had visitors. They would tell me stories of the world beyond my borders, heard from other traders. I would tell them tales of ages gone by, of empires and kingdoms great and small, long turned to dust and forgotten by mortals.

And yet I still stuck to my wisdom, no weapons or armour will be produced by my hand, for they will not be turned against me. I shake my head in my folly.

&amp;#x200B;

My reverie is interrupted by a weak cough at my doorstep. I know that cough, of little Abigail, weak of lung since she was but a year old. My medicine helped her live, but there's only so much I could do. I feel I'm being taunted by memories of my favorite friends, until I hear it again.

I raise my head up high, peering over the threshold. I can't see my friends, but I can hear them breathing. 

""Come, approach, be not afraid."" I say, as calmly as I can.

Abigail steps out, followed by her mother and a multitude of other townsfolks. My eyes go wide and I had seen their houses raised to the ground.

""By what magic have you survived?"" I ask.

Abigail steps forward to talk. I forget that I'm still imposing and that only a scant number of villagers have ever approached me.

""Umm, hello Serinax."" Abigail says, her voice betraying her fear.

""It's okay little one, I will do you no harm."" I say as peacefully as I can. I sigh inwards as I see the terrified villagers relax slightly.

""We hid in the basements."" she manages to reply, and I remember how resourceful humans can be. ""But we have no where else to go. Can ...... can we stay here?""

At this moment I realise why they are so scared. A terrifying monster of legend, and the plea of a 8 year old girl. None of the others knew what to expect. A century of being quiet neighbours helped ease their distrust of me, but they didn't know if that was enough to ask for my aid. If I said no, what where they to do and where were they to go.

""Of course my little princess,"" I whisper to Abigail, her face lighting up as it always does when I address her so. ""How many of you are there?""

Abigail's mother steps forward, ""I think about a hundred, plus whoever escaped into the forest.""

My heart freezes in my chest. Of the ten thousand that lived there, only about a hundred still lived. I know it's not my fault, but I could have helped them with the very weapons I abhorred.

I silently watch as my human friends bring what's remains of their belongings into my vast lair. My cousins are greedy and cruel, but they are few. I have truly learnt that humans can be either greedy and cruel, or generous and kind.

"fjtdgb1","Since I think the Personal Stories are the best part of the game, I think I can gladly add my favourites, though in no particular order and only of those I have played as of yet.\^\^

Best:

**Rika:** Definitely the best. A lot of emotional beats, super relatable wish, Rika being a total cinammon roll even before she meets Ren, great chemistry with Hinano. What more do you expect from a Madoka Magica side story?

**Team Nanaka** in general: I like the idea to tie all these characters together into one grand narrative and I also like how Nanaka, while undoubtedly having good intentions, has a very shady way of accomplishing her goal. Unfortunately since the story ends up hanging in the air until its corresponding event happens... it feels at times like it goes nowhere.

**Rumor Tsuruno:** I played this one last week and I couldn't help but keep imagining Tsuruno playing some theme park simulator game together with her creepy familiars.\^\^ As an addition to this part of the story I found it pretty cool to dive into her thought process as she was dealing with her bottled up pain and the tonal dissonance between this and the levity through the actually pretty likeable familiars worked really well. I now feel somewhat bad for slaughtering them in the main story...

**Alina/Holy Alina:** I don't have Alina, but I have Holy Alina and recently read an analysis of her main story. I am just surprised by the complexity of how it's her identification with her art that gives her these drastic mood swings, it goes far being the mad artist stereotype. Also her interactions with Karin, while extremely unhealthy, make for a believable relationship. It's a shame how one-note she comes off in the main story because of that...

**Rena:** Rena is a Tsundere cliché dialed up to the point of parody. Imagine my surprise at just how bloody dark Rena's dealing with her self-loathing actually turned out. And... to a degree her behavior was given a cruel, but reasonable explanation. I like that! Unfortunaly I don't see this take on her character show up to any degree in pretty much all the other aspects of the game...

**Mitama:** Maybe not the best story in terms of writing, but any kernel of Mitama's backstory adds to her undeniable depth and the character development necessary to have her arrive at the state of mind we meet her at.

Worst:

**Mayu:** Could have been a great set-up to criticize some social issues (with a heavy dosage of deconstruction of Moe). But no, instead we have Ria victim-blaming Mayu and driving her into her wish to save that asshat creep. No thank you.

**Natsuki:** Similar to the Mayu story it's the level of problematic messaging that puts me off.

People are gonna be shocked at your admission but I understand it. My old man taught me rather early that family is worthless, fragile and expendable. The only reason good families stick together is not blood or obligation, but because the family is full of good people who should stick together and is beneficial in some way. Family is not default, even if it feels like it because you are in a good family. Not perfect, but good.

ESH—

What your husband did was unfair and cruel. You didn’t deserve the way he treated you and it’s cruel. 

But there is a kid now, who is related to your husband, and that’s just the reality of it. This kid is going to be part of his life. He can’t be a half-way father without damaging some innocent kid. 

It might seem like the easy way out is banning the kid from your home… but that’s not fair to the kid. You’re an adult, you can leave and find a new husband. This kid can’t leave, this kid can’t even help who their dad is. 

So, while I understand what happened to you is cruel, unfair, and not what was promised to you… this is also what happened to this kid. They are the product of an affair. They have a dad who isn’t going to be there growing up. Their mother did an immoral thing to get pregnant. 

I just think you are in a better place to leave… and you should. Because your husband *shouldn’t* put his kid second. Kids don’t ask to be born. You didn’t ask for this to happen but you have the means to leave. He cheated on you, he doesn’t respect you, and I think he will likely do it again. He sounds like a jackass. 

But you would be an asshole to stand in the way of that kid having a relationship with their father. If you can’t handle the child, then you can’t handle what your husband did \[cheat\].

I had to add one more point: You might actually an exception if you have a strong network around you and even a more or less reliable chance for casual encounters.

But for most men it would be impossible to form a healthy, balanced mutually beneficial relationship with a woman they had sexual or romantic feelings for but turned down.

For most guys this wouldn't be a friendship but a desperate clinging to a float that already is gone too far. I actually advise women to be blunt and break contact after that because for 9 out of 10 guys it is the easiest way to confront the facts and move on. A clear cut (not cruel, but unambiguous) rejection stings hard but only for a relatively short time. On the other hand, being (maybe subconsciously) romantically attached to a woman who doesn't feel about you the same way tends to cost guys literal months or years of their dating life.

Grades and courses taken are one part of evaluating a potential student for admission to graduate school. There are many, many other factors, and you're vastly oversimplifying the process.

&gt;Unless someone works at my university and knows what's going on, they can only speculate

Very true. The best we can do is offer you likely scenarios based on our experience in academia, which we did many times before this went further south. If that wasn't good enough for you, you shouldn't have continued to post here.

&gt;**People believe that because of the drama post and this story spreading from person to person with details get changed and exaggerated along the way. Thus, I have been libeled.**

Nope. I haven't even read the post you're referencing. My knowledge of this situation is solely from your continued posts. 

&gt;You're not even writing this from your own account.

I'm not writing this from an alternate account so I can harass or gaslight you. I'm doing it because I am readily identifiable on my main account and your continued behavior has demonstrated that you're the last person on the planet I want to have access to my personal details. That in itself should demonstrate the effect your behavior has on people.

I'm sorry that happened to you. Drama for the sake of drama is cruel. But that doesn't excuse your behavior either.

Again, sorry that happened to you. Again, someone else's poor behavior doesn't excuse your poor behavior or imply that you haven't done something wrong.

&gt;Yet when I get just a little annoyed and react in kind to them, I'm ""cruel, entitled, and mean-spirited.""

That was in reference to you making fun of someone's religious beliefs out of nowhere. That's cruel and mean-spirited behavior. The ""entitled"" comment was in reference to your belief that you were owed interaction with the department and the people in it. 

&gt;I'm not harassed on other subs. In fact, most comments are sympathetic and supportive.

That's because you tell a highly censored and carefully manipulated version of the story on other subs, whereas the people on this sub have been privy to the full events and range of your behavior.

"fc2goqh","**Jaskier and Geralt**

I liked this part, overall. It made sense to introduce how Jaskier met Geralt. Jaskier is here probably at the beginning of his career and not well known. That he could be fascinated by Geralt's and become his PR agency... That's the change I could live with. Peasants in original insisted Geralt would not kill diaboł, but here we had Marilka previously saying Kikimora are killing pests; I think it's a bit different, I will talk about it more below.

That Geralt hits him in the balls... Well, I could live with that as well. Overall, the changes were well within adaptation.

The ""it looks like a cannonball"" line was stupid. 

""Toruviel, you were supposed not to hurt them!"" Oh gee. So we are going with noble Elves doing nothing bad? I books Filavandrel was perfectly OK with killing both Geralt and sylvan, and they were saved only by Sapkowski - which (blasphemy! Burn the heretic!) I think now was kind of *deus ex machina* and would simply not work in the series (though I understand some people think it was great twist and it had some message behind it). I think it was understandable creators changed that, but changing it into noble elves having change of their hearts was stupid.

""You think it's about pride?"" Yes, it was! ""Great Cleansing?"" WTF? A very stupid and unnecessary modification of the history. I do not think elves were cooperating with humans. Rather, it was described that they considered humans temporary plague. Show runners are making them into innocent, noble minority here, which is stupid.

**Ciri**

The whole Ciri's thread should be removed. It was irritating and brought nothing.

**Yennefer**

Surprisingly, I find out that actually I enjoyed this part. It was not the adaptations, but I thought - if that wouldn't be witcher, if I had not know the books earlier, this would be actually enjoyable. Some stupidities wre either explainable or acceptable. Why the pair of lovers snaps at Yennefer because she gave them flowers? Stupid, but accaptable in TV series. Why she spontaneously jumped into Istredd's cave? Because it was the place bringing the magic from all around the world. Besides, it's clear that Istredd is Yennefer true love - the destiny made her jump right into his cave. Why he send her back? Well, to her family. Better than into some deserted field.

Magical eels? Very stupid from the point of view of books but... naaah. Still very stupid as an adapation.

Now I think that show creators just felt jelous that Geralt and witchers went through so much during their training, so they decided that Aretuza, instead of being tough school for rich but ugly girls, must be Kaer Morhen for girls. It would be so unfair if only 3/10 boys survive trial of Grass (and there is also selection before Trial of Grass!) but girls only have to learn many years in schools. I wonder which genius took this idea: hey, what if sorceresses would have to endure the same shit witcher's do? Now Yennefer will be able to say ""hey, you Geralt. You are not that unique"". And Istredd would not be saying ""I had to study for years, reading books"" instead he would complain about yoga classes and how he could be turned into eel. 

In books you have a contrast between mages - intellectuals, equivalent of our scientists, who are a bit pretentious and snobs - and witchers - down to earth, who work in dirt and blood. A contrast like between scientists and engineers. Here: not so much.

I couldn't remember from the Saga how the magic system worked, but I understand from other's posts that it was changed here too.

**Shades of gray.**

It's nice they introduce nice women who helps Ciri, despite being racist, but... Again I feel Lauren Hissrich does not understand what ""shades of gray"" really mean. That a racist can be nice person is not ""shade of gray"" it's painfully obvious statement. The shades of gray in Witcher were that *Elves were racists*, who oppressed others and despise humans, but lose wars and now are victims of racism themselves.

I think the fault is because of shocking lack of diversity in Lauren's writers' room. They are all liberals, judging from the infamous post in which they expressed their political views. This influenced how they perceived the world of witcher. I don't know if this is because they simply not noticed those nuances, or whether they decided to ditch them, but until now the result is that the world of witcher is flattened and while still not white-and-black, the contrasts are still much more sharp than in the books.

In books peasants were shown as maybe stupid, but they didn't want to kill Diaboł. I found their approach very realistic, the one I found in Polish countryside: live and let live, very practical, sometimes brainless but still very down-to-earth and realistic approach, sometimes very cruel but mixed with this strange feeling that ""we are all God's creations"". Here we had Marilka expressing similar attitude where she in previous episode stated Kikimora is not a pest. However, Marilka is a girl, from a town. I guess this is another change reflecting lack of diversity in writers' room: *of course* sentiments like that couldn't come from stupid peasants, they had to be expressed by a girl from a town! Maybe I am a bit oversensitive here, but I came from a little town, I interact often with people from villages and at the same time I live now in big cities and I see this attitude far too often.

**Summary**

Overall, I think this episode is much better than the 1st one. The writing seems to be better, and thought there are some cringe moments, I could actually enjoy it. As an adaptation, I'd say it's about 3/10; as a standalone it's a solid average, generic American fantasy, say 4/10, maybe even 5/10. Nothing spectacular, nothing bad.

"fbhvzdm","You're looking at it from a very lopsided point of view, and a very human one. Ravaging, which I assume is what you're referring to, is just another way to get Glamour. Changelings aren't spirits of peace, love or sweetness... Some are tricksters, some are nobles, some are spirits of honour and some are spirits of hunger. They effect the world in different ways and, by their nature, some carry an impact that you're thinking of as negative - but it's just part of The Great Play. It's all emotions and story telling, song and dance, smoke and mirrors. Plays need heroes and villains, shining lights and skulking shadows. Antagonist and protagonists.  
  
 Ravaging, in and of itself, isn't a long term problem. Do it once to a mortal and they suffer for a bit, get all emotional, and then, as the Unseelie view it, they chrysalis, change and come out of it with new, different aspirations. Change, as the Unseelie see it, is always good. A writer who keeps writing the same kind of story loses their Glamour. A writer who has a Ravaging with an Unseelie Fae walks away writing new, different stories... Sometimes darker for the experience, sometimes more hopeful as compensation. Sometimes they stop writing, but if they are a resilient Dreamer, they'll be doing something else soon.    
  
 The problem occurs with *repeated* Ravaging of the same Dreamer. That's a long term issue! Also there's always a risk to the Changeling doing the Ravaging as well, but that's very much up the Unseelie creek - High risk, high reward, fast and loose!  
   
 If you want to liken it to environmental impacts:  
  
 Reverie is like using only recycled materials. Over time the materials become less and less useful because nothing new is added to them. It's slow, its expensive... It's best for the environment, but not best for the consumer.  
  
 Ravaging is like cutting down and replanting. You get what you need, new buds grow in their place, but if you're cutting too fast, the buds can't grow in time to meet your demand and, when you come back round, you've only got little shoots you're pulling out of the ground, killing everything.  
  
 Then you've got Rhapsody, which is like clear cutting an area then salting the earth! Those people are villains... Which brings up the last point: Not every Unseelie Fae uses Ravaging, and very few use Rhapsody. Think of it like this - if, tomorrow, all the world leaders agreed that Dec 23rd was Purge day, there would be people who went around killing everyone... But not everyone would get involved. Just because the Unseelie mostly agree that Ravaging is fine if you're not an idiot doesn't mean there aren't Unseelie Fae who still shy away from it. There would be plenty, I imagine, who use Reverie on their own Dreamers out of a sense of ownership and resource management, but use Ravaging on strange Dreamers they meant or the average man on the street.  
  
 In short: A little Ravaging isn't evil or unsustainable. Ravaging endlessly is the strip mining of Glamour, for sure, and Fae that do that are selfish and cruel, but Seelie and Unseelie alike can and do use it, because villainy isn't an inherent trait of either, the same as generosity.

Lan talks about how Fades are used to organize and command the Trollocs who are vicious and cruel, but also lazy and cowardly.  This makes them essentially the evil that is inside every normal person brought to monstrous proportions visualized as the bestial appearance.  Likewise Fades are ""blind"" evil.  They are more like tools for the Dark One with no real expression of their own will.  Lastly Madishar, the embodiment of paranoia and fear, striking at anything and everything.  The standard trope of bad guys is evil will never win because it will turn on itself, thieves will cheat each other, they will turn snitch ect.

"f9l8c70","Empowering the unions who were more concerned with ideological class warfare than amicable solutions to the issues of the day was a terrible policy. Labour didn't cause stagflation but it certainly poured salt into the wound.

Even if it wasn't pig-headedly ideological when it came to the unions, its policy of nationalisation and bailouts was terrible. It kept terrible management practices and work processes alive and insulated from market forces so they never improved. British Leyland was the prime example of this, here's an itemised list of ways that Labour had a hand in killing our car industry:

* Benn encouraged the merger of the ailing BMH with the successful Leyland Motors in order to prevent job losses. This was an awful idea for a number of reasons: 1) it led to a lot of expensive duplication of efforts but not enough that a strike at one plant didn't prevent stoppages at others. 2) it created a bloated Frankenstein's monster of a company full of silos. Austin/MG/Triumph workers saw themselves as Austin/MG/Triumph workers rather than Leyland workers and would refuse to assemble ""competitors"" cars even when they were badge-engineered versions of the same thing and 3) large companies are much less agile and slow to change than many small companies even when they're not idiotically competing against themselves.

* When this mess was inevitably on the rocks, Labour nationalised it. This meant that a) the managers made bad decision after bad decision never seeing consequences because the government would bail them out and b) workers could relentlessly take the piss as the unions made them essentially unfirable. Even today Leyland is the butt of many jokes among car enthusiasts and the horror stories are manifold, things like engine blocks containing more sand than steel and fittings being bodged with matchsticks from the factory.

* As well as being run atrociously, being a nationalised monolith made sure that BL was never forced to innovate. The classic Mini while iconic wasn't fundamentally changed from the late 1950s until production ended in 2000! The infamous Morris Marina was basically using 1940s tech when it was released in the 1970s. There was barely any innovation going on, because nationalised businesses stay the cruel but very necessary hand of natural selection in the business world.

As a result of this, British Leyland eventually collapsed because nobody wanted to buy British cars. It fell to bits slowly with Thatcher taking various parts round the back to shoot them in the head. This is an extreme example of what Corbyn's policy can do, but it's not a unique one. Time and time again, nationalised industries coupled with artificial class conflict ideologically pushed by the hard left lead to nothing but disaster.

"f8cmgwb","This is about to be long I feel like but Eren isn’t the 3 eyed raven he doesn’t see everything in the future which has already been confirmed . Even if he did tho why would the person with the power to see the future use this moment with somebody else to see if the future will change if he has the power to see the future ? He coulda easily avoided the conversation and then bam future changed . Now Mikasa’s words definitely played a huge part in why Eren did what he did . 

People seem to be under this thinking that whatever Mikasa said to Eren wouldn’t have changed anything (not saying that’s what you think but in general) which is 100% false because it would’ve changed the whole timeskip as we know it . That one short but big moment was a culmination of their entire journey together . The world is a cruel but beautiful world and understanding eachother.

Eren is clearly not in a great state of mind this chapter , he’s constantly off in the distance and he constantly has bags under his eyes and just looks out of it . The only time he looks normal is when Mikasa brings him ice cream but he can’t really enjoy it at the same time like them because he’s already seen it . Eren was crying looking at the kid and the elder because they reminded him of him , Mikasa and Armin . People who lost their everyday lives and everything else . 

Eren then asks her why she cares so much about him and says is it because he saved her or because he’s family but then he didn’t stop there and asked a direct question . “What am I to you” or in the literal translation “I’m your what” . Mikasa does what she always does and falls back on calling him family because she’s a shy girl and Eren just put her on the spot. Neither of them are satisfied with that answer tho because Mikasa clearly feels more than just that and Eren wasn’t finished with the convo because they got interrupted and he even says “perfect timing” .

What Eren wanted and needed in that moment was love , reassurance , seeing something beautiful in the cruel world which he has forgotten exist . Would Mikasa’s answer stop Eren from fighting for “freedom” ? No but he damn sure wouldn’t have went straight to mass genocide and he wouldn’t have made a lot of the actions he’s made since the timeskip . The irony of the situation is that Eren is just like Mikasa was when he wrapped the scarf around her , he’s vulnerable and he now knows the meaning and how powerful one act like that can be which he didn’t know until chapter 50 and Mikasa understands Eren for who he is completely both how beautiful and cruel he is . 

That moment had nothing to do with ackerbonds which he doesn’t know about at that time plus isayama himself stated that the reason Mikasa and Levi act the way they do towards Eren and Erwin have nothing to do with their bloodlines , it had nothing to do with future memories or anything of the sort . It was just a intimate moment between two people who regardless of how people feel , love eachother . And tbh it was a moment that should’ve happened and needed to happen way sooner because in reality what are they ? They’ve never put a title on what they are . Some people try to say they’re siblings but Mikasa clearly doesn’t see him that way and neither does Eren because he states this multiple times . You can’t say they’re just friends because then that undermines their whole relationship and I guess you can say they’re family but is that really all they are ? 

Issue is that after chapter 50 they never talked about it and just kept the status quo as it was . Yeah the relationship drastically got better but the characters themselves never talked about what happened that moment which was what this moment was for but they got interrupted . Everything with Eren , Mikasa , Armin and all the problems since the timeskip come from a lack of communication from all parties .",1574463527,"the world is a cruel but beautiful world and understanding eachother.","cruel but beautiful","cruel","but",FALSE,"cruel but beautiful","beautiful",NA,NA,1

For example, many pro-choicers would say it is cruel for pro-lifers to force women to maintain a pregnancy.

But note the definition doesn't even require cruelty; it says ""cruel or violent."" I think a very good case can be made for abortion being violence.

"f5afwkd","Never. Punishment is rarely, if ever, used in animal training, because it is not only unnecessary and cruel, but it also doesn’t work. Operant conditioning through positive reinforcement is 100% what they use... this means positively reinforcing the behaviors they want, and ignoring the behaviors they don’t want. For example, teaching a sea lion how to stay still for a vet exam would involve feeding for a “stay”, and not feeding when the animal is moving around. 

Regardless, the animals always get their full diet, unless they are not hungry (they’ll leave you and do whatever it is they want). Food is never withheld. If they don’t get their full meal during one training session (because they weren’t hungry or weren’t feeling the session), it will be made up at the next meal. 

Training behaviors is both necessary for veterinary exams, and for enrichment for the animal. It’s a means of challenging, exercising, and bonding. Keeps them mentally and physically stimulated, and can come in the form of training sessions with and without the public, as well as toys, treats, and changes in their environment.

Also, this is a sea lion, and my source is that I’m a sea lion trainer. 

PS, I can assure you that this is most likely a rescued sea lion. Young sea lions strand frequently from things such a injuries or abandonment. When possible, they’re rehabbed and released, but when they’re not, they’re adopted by facilities for educational purposes. There is absolutely an abundance of non-releasable sea lions in need of homes, so it’s wildly unnecessary to breed them. And the government (at least in the US) is who determines whether an animal is releasable or not... not the facilities taking them in.",1572106617,"punishment is rarely, if ever, used in animal training, because it is not only unnecessary and cruel, but it also doesn’t work.","unnecessary and cruel","cruel",NA,FALSE,"only unnecessary and cruel","unnecessary",NA,"only",0
"f5a4ifq","I agree. I feel like my original comment already addressed your point but I'll elaborate. Of course, Hodor's fate was tragic, cruel and far too brutal for the sweet hearted Hodor. His mind and choice were taken from him indeed, although I would argue Bran is not ""some rich asshole"". The show quite clearly shows us that Bran was confused by the Hodor flashback, and did not intend for his loyal friend to be mentally castrated nor sacrificed. What happened to Hodor was a tragic accident, it was also one of the single greatest heroic acts in the show. Bran is not controlling Hodor as he holds the door shut, Hodor is doing it because all his life he has known that he weill have to hold that door one day and he is rising to meet his cruel fate.

Yes, he could have had a good life as far as any of the characters in the show know. But we as an audience know that his life would have been tragically ended by the night king one way or the other (no way hodor would survive the battle of winterfell imo), my point was that we can always consider Hodor's fate to be tragic and cruel but we should also remember that he did choose to meet his destiny.

"f58uw5l","_Sometimes._

That’s the operative word there, sometimes. The world is sometimes, maybe even usually gritty pointless and cruel, but not twenty four seven. That was what Marla’s plot line demonstrated in Fight Club, that the world is a messed up and shitty place, but sometimes it’s worth it. This is what sets Arthur and Fight Club’s Narrator apart: the Narrator of Fight Club can be happy, and if he had chosen not to be, it would have made thematic sense. He would have embraced being the broken monster that is Tyler Durden by rejecting the happiness that society offered him, truly choosing to reject society.

Contrast with Arthur, who never had that choice of throwing down society or being happy. Because Sophie’s arc is all in his head, society supposedly has no redeeming qualities. Because Sophie isn’t real, society supposedly deserves the Joker. Arthur outright says “you get what you deserve” before killing Martin, but Arthur wasn’t broken because of society: he was broken by his mother’s abuse. Society was simply incapable of putting him back together.

This is the point where you can argue that the thesis of the story is that everything is cruel, gritty and pointless, that happiness is an illusion and that the world deserves people like the Joker for the pointless evil that breaks men like Arthur Fleck. That would be a workable thesis, had society been what broke Arthur.

"f3tf0bd","So.. I know that this isn't exact to the prompt, but seeing other people sharing their stories made me feel like I could relate so I wanted to share my own experiences. Apologies in advance for not following the prompt exactly and the format, I'm on mobile and I've never commented on something before. I'm sorry if this is long :(

My dad and I disowned each other at one point. That's a bit confusing so I'll try my best to elaborate.
I loved my parents dearly when I was younger. I was a little lid and they were my family, so of course little me practically idolized them and wanted nothing more than to please them and make them proud. I always sought after my parent's love and affection then. Back when I was around 4-ish, I moved back from my birth country to the States. My dad is a US citizen and both my mom and I were born in another country. But I became a US citizen through my dad - my mom, however, was still on visa (adding this bcos it might be relevant) We lived in a few places, but my memories of that time only begin at this one apartment. One of the clearest things I remember is that feeling of wanting to make my dad proud of me. Desperately chasing after him and always striving to be a good child. I'm an only child and at that time I never had any friends or relatives to play with so the only people I really had, were my parents. My mom was always working and would leave really early and come home at night, so as a kid it sometimes felt like she was never around. My dad worked too, but he could never really hold a stable job, so most of the time he was unemployed and he was the one who spent the most time with me. But when you're a kid, you don't know those things, you only see that one parent is always there and more present than the other. I think that's why I stuck to my dad so much back then, I thought that him always being around to take care of me meant he cared more about me.

Now, I don't know about my dad's side so this is only my side of the story, but my dad was kind of a terror. He would blow up at me for the tiniest things. One minute, he was normal and okay and the next he was screaming in my face about how fucking useless and worthless I was. I remember one time I was talking about something my mom said and I used that exact wording, ""my mom"" to reference her and the next thing I knew was pain and him yelling at me, saying ""How dare you say ""MY mom"" she doesn't belong to you!! You ungrateful brat, she's not yours!! You don't have any fucking right to call her that!!"" I was bewildered and terrified, I didn't understand what I did that was so wrong and I didn't know why he was so mad at me - the only thing I knew was that I was a bad kid who upset my dad again. From then on, I never used the word ""my"" in reference to my mom. He blew up at me for a lot of things, and I won't go into detail about all of it because this story is long enough without it haha. 

One of the things that always stuck with me were all the times he said he hated me, how we he wished I was never born, how he wished I had died in the womb, how much I ruined his life, how he wished he had a son instead of ""a useless fucking daughter"", how he wished he could just abandon me or give me up for adoption. He told me that he wished I never existed and how I wasn't his daughter. All these wonderful things he said to me when I was 5 and in kindergarten. Still, 5 year old me wanted to do better, to become a better child, to just make my parents happy and make them proud. I always wondered why my parents hated me so much - why my dad beat me up and screamed at me and why my mom was never around and why my parents always fought, and I came to the conclusion that it had to be all my fault. I was a terrible child. I was a terrible daughter. I was a monster that just destroyed eveything. I was responsible for everything. If I had just been a better child, everything would be okay. My dad wouldn't hate me, my mom would spend more time with me, and they would just stop fucking fighting.

He continued to torment me in elementary, he kicked me out of the house once when I was in 3rd grade for leaving the mayo jar open. He tricked me into getting abandoned at this small shopping place when I was in 2nd grade and drove away (though he later drove back and picked me up though I never understood why, even now)

I was fucked for the longest time and my idea of everything was really distorted. I became more like my dad, I was extremely twisted and manipulative. I believed I was a monster, so I acted like it - because after all, monsters don't care about who they hurt. My dad soon got really sick and a lot of shit happened to him. He became legally blind and he couldn't move as well. He got skinnier, he wasn't as physically strong as he was before. He kind of only stayed in his bedroom. We grew more distant. By the time I was in my last year of elemntary, I had cut him out of my life. I decided he wasn't my dad, that he was just some stranger who lived in our house. I never talked to him, even when he tried to talk to me (though his way of talking to me was always yelling my name). I became friends with this one person and ended up always staying at their house because I didn't want to be in my own home and didn't want to see my parents. Shit happened. I sank lower and lower and when I thought I couldn't sink any further, I did. My dad started hanging out with these guys in front of our complex who seem really shady and just drink. He came home once with a new tattoo and kept grunting (his way of trying to get our attention) but I ignored him. I ignored my mom and dad as best as I could and I would fight with my mom a lot. At one point, I became obsessed with leaving everything behind and going to someplace new. My mom finally broke down from it all and wanted to know what she could do to make me happy and salvage everything, and I asked her to send me back to our home country and she agreed. The days leading up to me leaving, I got ""better"". I stopped fighting with my mom and was nicer, but it was only because I thought I could finally leave everyone behind me and in the past. I wanted to change and be a different person.

I still hadn't talked to my dad once. He knew I was leaving, but he never really said anything either since we stopped talking long ago. When I was leaving the house to go to the airport, he was just silently sitting there in the living room. My mom was downstairs, already in the car. I was just going to close the door and go, but for some reason, I turned around. I don't know what came over me, but I turned around and said, ""Dad?"" He looked up at me, really surprised but not saying anything. ""I.. I'm going now."" He smiled at me and said, ""Oh! have a good time."" My parting words were, ""Thanks.. Dad.. let's talk when I get back."" He looked genuinely happy, and for some reason, I was happy too. I started thinking that maybe we could finally have a good relationship. I was even excited to come back (I was only going away for a year) and fix things with my dad. My mom was surprised and happy when I told her that I said goodbye to him.


He died a month before I came back. A month before my birthday and the trip that my mom planned for me as a present. The trip was a blur. Everything was a blur. I'm told that he was asking for me at the hospital before he died. When I came back, it wasn't anything like I imagined of a happy reunion where I could reconcile with my dad. I came back to nothing. I don't even remember if I looked at him in his casket at the funeral. Again, I was fucked for a long time. I sank so fucking low, and I let myself do it. I let myself drown and just watched as everything grew distant. I hated myself, I hated being alive. I was alive but I lived like I was dead. I wanted nothing more than to disappear before I destroyed anything else. Once again, I felt like a monster only capable of fucking everything up and hurting everyone close to me. I was good at hiding it and pretending but there's only so much cracks you can hide before the whole thing crumbles yknow.

I'm not telling this story to depress you guys, in fact, it's the opposite. I'm in a much, MUCH, better place now. I'm still struggling, but yknow that's just how life is. I'm so much happier and I'm proud of the progress I've made. I remember thinking that there was no way I was ever going to get out of that dark place. But here I am now! Alive and happy. It just took me a while to realize that that dark place wasn't the one hiding me. I was hiding myself. I was scared that I was going to hurt people and I was scared I was going to get hurt, so I hid myself away and let myself drown to ""protect everyone and myself"". Really, I was just hurting everyone and myself but isolating and distancing myself from people. The only thing that stopped me from getting better, from saving myself, was my own fear.

There's still things I don't understand about what my dad did and I'm definitely not excusing his actions. What he did was wrong and cruel. But I will never doubt, not for a second, that my dad truly loved me. I know he had his own demons that he just had a hard time fighting that he would sometimes lose to. I hate his actions but I don't hate him and I forgive him for what happened because I know in my heart, that if he was alive right now, he would be proud of me :)

"f2dnqk6","That makes sense. I'll admit I like to take refuge in being on the indisputable moral high ground, so the Jacques de Molay thing makes me uncomfortable since it's a very gray situation. Not that either side in this conflict is known for fighting fair, but I like to think the Assassins are the fairer of the two.

It almost seems to alternate from game to game between black-and-white morality vs shades of gray. The issue of control vs freedom is always there, but how valid each side's argument changes frequently. The Templars in AC1 and the Ezio Trilogy are pretty consistently bad guys, since beyond simple Templar ideology they are often corrupt, selfish, and cruel. But in AC3 Haytham does a pretty good job at arguing his case, at least far, far better than any had before him. Then AC4, they're all bad guys again.

Then Unity is gray on gray on gray; the Assassins aren't really helping things, and several Templars, most notably Elise, come across as decent people. It puts the idea in your head that both sides can agree to disagree and respect one another's opinions, like people in modern politics sometimes do (and should do more), i.e. you may disagree with me, but that doesn't make you a bad person.

And then Rogue flips things, to where the Templars look reasonable and the Assassins argue for themselves really poorly.

Then Syndicate goes in the opposite direction. The Templars are all shit bags and regardless of ideology, they're all bad people, or closely associate with and enable bad people.

It's weird and kind of disjointed, though I don't know if I'd prefer it to be any other way. It does feel weird when the narrative keeps reversing course, but in a way it does a good job of showing that sometimes your enemies are bad people, sometimes they aren't. If it was always black-and-white, it would become sorta cliché, whereas if it was always gray, it might get emotionally exhausting. Sometimes it's nice to feel like a good guy.",1570159245,"the templars in ac1 and the ezio trilogy are pretty consistently bad guys, since beyond simple templar ideology they are often corrupt, selfish, and cruel.","selfish, and cruel","cruel",NA,TRUE,"selfish , and cruel","selfish",NA,NA,0

I would never keep him from his son unless he went totally insane or became dangerous to himself. If I see a reason to file for custody, I will do so, but he knows he would be f\*cked if I took him to court, so he's trying to maintain peace (except for the moments of name-calling and cruelty). He can be unstable, and cruel, but has made efforts to help himself. He knows he has a problem and has done years of therapy.

Neither of us want to go through the court system, as it often results in mud-slinging and can be very hard on kids. And besides, I don't want to see his wages garnished for child support. Since support depends on time with the child, filing for support often causes the other partner to request more custody. It's just a mess that we can avoid. (Another side note, I've talked extensively with a lawyer, and she has made it clear that my county is what they call ""father friendly"". Even emotionally abusive fathers end up with 50-50 custody around here.) 

I will raise my son without help if I have to. I have a career. 

My biggest struggle is how to find emotional strength, I guess. Maybe I need to post this in a forum for depression or anxiety or something. Or just find someone to talk to who can relate.

I kind of do it weird. I figure out alignment and personality separately, depending on what I want to play and who I'll be playing with. Then I use alignment to determine _why_ they do the things they do.

Let's say I want to play an evil character. I'm interested in having them be an artificer/gunslinger type.

"eu47uan","I assumed you were American, because most people on reddit are, but actually I'm German too.

For Germany, I'm aware of an estimate that [98% of animals eaten come from factory farms.](https://www.stern.de/wirtschaft/news/fleisch--massentierhaltung-in-echtzeit---zu-viel-von-allem-6522504.html) So the situation is not vastly different from the US or Australia.

If you want to look at European footage, [there's a recent documentary from the UK](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvtVkNofcq8). It shows typical organic and/or high-wellfare farming in the UK, and these standards are virtually the same in Germany.

&gt; by taking away habitats and by overhunting (especially fish) and because of contamination because of our waste.

The major reason for habitat loss and damaging organic waste (excessive manure) is animal agriculture, though. 

Sure, this would happen much less if we had less humans, but we can't reduce easily reduce the number of humans. What we can do is switch to a more efficient food system, and that would be a [plant-based system](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6392/987):

&gt;  Moving from current diets to a diet that excludes animal products (table S13) (35) has transformative potential, reducing food’s land use by 3.1 (2.8 to 3.3) billion ha (a 76% reduction), including a 19% reduction in arable land; food’s GHG emissions by 6.6 (5.5 to 7.4) billion metric tons of CO2eq (a 49% reduction); acidification by 50% (45 to 54%); eutrophication by 49% (37 to 56%); and scarcity-weighted freshwater withdrawals by 19% (−5 to 32%) for a 2010 reference year. 

Concerning nutrition you said that:

&gt; If I find time I will link you a review that summarized over 1000 studies and came to the conclusion that on average heavy meat eaters and vegans have the most unhealthy nutrition.

That would be interesting, I've never heard of such a study.  As far as I know, [the consensus in nutrition science](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/19562864/) is that:

&gt; It is the position of the American Dietetic Association that appropriately planned vegetarian diets, including total vegetarian or vegan diets, are healthful, nutritionally adequate, and may provide health benefits in the prevention and treatment of certain diseases. Well-planned vegetarian diets are appropriate for individuals during all stages of the life cycle, including pregnancy, lactation, infancy, childhood, and adolescence, and for athletes.

&gt; And please tell me the downside of keeping a smaller amount of chickens? We got around 120, they can do what they want all day long, no fence, they indirectly recycle our food waste and we get fresh eggs.

The man downside is ethical:

* Where did you get your chickens from? Did you buy them? What did the person who bred the chickens do with the male chickens? In all likelihood, he/she killed the chickens directly after birth. How is it justified to kill male chickens in order to obtain eggs (which aren't a necessary part of the human diet) from the female ones?
* What will you do with the chickens once they stop laying eggs? Keep them around? Or sell them so that they are send to slaughter? Do you consider it a violation of their rights if you have them killed once you don't consider them useful anymore? 
* By taking away their eggs, your chickens automatically lay more eggs. This causes additional strain on their bodies, which increases their health risks (weak bones, diseases of their reproductive organs, etc.). Is causing them this health risk justified if you can live healthy without eating eggs?
* If you take their eggs, they can't eat them themselves, which they would naturally do in order to regain nutrients. (Or hopefully you're already feeding some eggs back to them? That would be a good start if you're concerned about their wellbeing.)

In addition to this, you are wasting ressources (you need to feed them a lot of grain to get a few eggs, it would be more efficient to eat the grain directly) in order to get an unhealthy product (high saturated fat and cholesterol) which isn't yours to begin with, it belongs to the hens.

&gt; Let me guess they didn't show a single farm where animals live a happy and carefree live?

Obviously there are differences. There is this ~1% of animals which proabably lives relatively happy lives. But:

* Shouldn't it be more important to inform about the other 99% first? After all, that's where the vast majority of the products come from that people are buying.
* Even animals living on the greatest farms are killed against their will once their human owner considers murdering them to be economically useful. These sentient beings are a commodity. The abuse inherent to taking somebody's life against their will, for an unnecessary reason, does not disappear just because they had a relatively nice life.

&gt; Every animal I eat either comes from the wild and needed to be killed or had a better life than in the wild

&gt; It can easily be done. 

Well, it isn't. Around 99 percent of animal products worldwide, also in Europe, come from factory farms. This cruel but efficient industry is *needed* because the demand for these products is so high. And *still* it's not sustainable and the leading cause of environmental destruction. If you want the industry to be nicer to the animals, it also becomes less efficient, and thus even more damaging to the enviroment. And then, animals are still being murded unnecessarily. So that's not a viable solution from any perspective.

&gt; Every animal I eat either comes from the wild and needed to be killed or had a better life than in the wild

Again, even if they had ""a better life than in the wild"", this is not relevant. These animals don't appear on earth by accident. We *unnecessarily* breed them into existence by the billion.

"eu3jdfa","The afterlife might require a bit of faith, but the teleological and epistemological implications of theism don't.  You can curve your practice around truth and have real ethics.  That is to say, that you can evaluate the material world by a higher standard.  Materialist governments tend to assume the role of God and declare themselves to be the ethical rule and the arbiter of truth.  They don't have an immovable foundation and thus often take cruel but convenient shortcuts.  
  
Another thing that I hinted at is the way that hobbies or activism take on religious roles in the human psyche.  While a hobby can organize your life by making you a nerd, activism as a purpose is incredibly unstable and dangerous.  Organized religions have had hundreds if not thousands of years of wisdom, balance, critique, and selection wash them.  Even if you don't think one is true, to dismiss them all as fake and outdated is to invite a collision with a hard lesson we've already learned.

I was an addict and sex was the only drug that also made me feel good about myself, and I could never admit my addictive behaviours to myself, so I was basically in denial when I cheated and when I lied. When my cheating came to light, I had already hid it so well and so long ago that I was shocked myself. 

&amp;#x200B;

What I did: Told someone who already had trust issues that I would ""never, ever, ever cheat on you because why would I do that, and if I did like something happened, I would feel bad and tell you immediately"". So fast forward to 1.75 years later, I cheated on them in a massage parlor, got an STD, and then told them about the cheating a month and a half later. I didn't realize the STD until it was too late. The worst part is she forgave me for all that. It was really hard and she would constantly remember the cheating and be hurt and confront me again, but she understood why it happened (I was stressed, graduating soon, I've had terrible insomnia and sleep apnea which are all true statements). And she continued to forgive me for that for 2-3 weeks. At this point school was over, so me and this girl were basically living together and I was so happy to house her, pay for her meals, and basically take care of her while she was dealing with this. But she still didn't trust me, checked my phone, found the one desperate craigslist email I didn't delete, and then left. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I'm writing this for my own therapy benefit because I considered this person my family and I considered myself a good person. I couldn't understand why I did this. I felt so hopeless, like I was broken person and I would have hurt anyone that I tried to love. I've tried to reconcile this with my therapist because the fact is that I was and am a huge liar, to the point I didn't believe that i was. So here are those reasons (or excuses which is what they feel like):

\- ""sexualized"" as a child: For some reason I have been masturbating since I was 6, and in kindergarden I had a really weird experience with a girl in the class. The girl would always find me at nap time, put her towel next to mine, and we would kiss. I think on the cheek. But I don't know. I just know it felt like heaven at the time, but never really made sense to me, and I was embarassed. My therapist thinks something else happened that is worse, but I cannot recall in any way. I tried to commit suicide when I was 13, so I always thought there was something wrong iwth me, but even at that age I was upset at school and my life and parentage, not being raped. I've heard therapists just to this conclusion sometimes so I take it with a grain of salt because I'd rather not create those memories. 

&amp;#x200B;

\- Predisposition to Addiction: So I'm a mid 20 year old. My family has a long history of addiction on both sides. The grandparents on my mom side drank and smoked themselves to death. One died of lung cancer and the other liver cirrhosis, at least thats what I was told. I wouldn't know because they died by the time I was 1. On my dad side, its almost worse. Everyone is an alcoholic, so nobody is. All of my uncles are taking some form of obesity/alcoholic/mental health medication. And all of them were only recently put on them. Mind you, they are old now, but they should be in the ground as well. We must have some pretty incredible physical Genes but nobody put any points into mental health because even on that side they don't share their problems with each other. Both my parents were the baby's of the family and NEVER dealt with these issues to my knowledge. They both drink fairly often but never get drunk or had issues that I know of. EVERYONE on both sides has a large happy family and no surface issues so I never really took the idea of ""everyone of your family is an addict, you probably have those same issues"" to heart. 

&amp;#x200B;

\- Trust &amp; insecurity &amp; Anger/Resentment Issues: Despite not having a real-world tragedies (Middle-class family with 9 uncles and aunts (not including the ones by marriage) who all went on to have children and successful families except for 1 single cousin of mine who is in jail for gay pedophilia), My childhood was a bit rough and I was picked on a lot by the kids in my neighborhood who were all a bit older than me. It was the type of situation where I was trying to be friendly, and every day trying to be worthy of their friendship because there wasn't any other friends to be with. I was like 6-11 hanging out with people who were 10-15 so obviously I was the punching bag. But I was going outside to play with them like it was my own fault and I could somehow be less of a loser so they would like me. I eventually tried to hide from those relationships especially as they got older and more cruel, but my parents forced me outside because I was (get this) addicted to video games! At this point I started to hide from all my problems in various addictions, lie to my parents a lot more (and got away with it, the worst part). 

&amp;#x200B;

So I obviously had some problems going into high school and college but they weren't that severe. I wasn't an alcoholic, I never drank or did actually bad behaviour for a kid. I was just arguing with my parents all the time about basic shit that I struggled to do (ADHD? I could never get my chores done before my mom got home and she would flip shit when she did). 

&amp;#x200B;

But in general I thought I was a good person and I was slowly getting better at dealing with my problems. I thought. I wasn't. In reality I had been binge eating since I was 13, having wanton sex at 15 with anyone I could, and pushing everyone away possible for reasons that made no sense (based on those insecurities).

&amp;#x200B;

I wanted to push everyone away so much that I went to college with no one that i knew and I never made friends, despite having many in college. I wasn't even trying. I avoided leaving my dorm as much as possible. I gained 80 pounds over 2 years. I eventually moved back home to go to a closer school because I lost my full scholarhsip (had to keep a 3.0). When I came home I stayed with my parents for a little but tried to get out as fast as possilbe. I tried to get treated for adhd but in reality I thought Adderall might be a nice tool and immediately started abusing it for the euphoria. Went to max dosage for half a year before I acknowledged and gave it up and went to a legitimate therapist and psychiatrist that would actually try to help me. SO lucky we found someone like that we could trust.  During this time I had also reconnected with friends from home who all smoked weed. So I started smoking as often as possible. Unfortunately I was terrible at taking my meds and when the meds interferred with finishing school/smoking weed, I said fuck off and left both therapist and psychiatrist so I could start my new treatment of smoking weed everyday. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

NONE OF THIS IS TO SAY THESE THINGS EXCUSE MY BEHAVIOURS. You might hate me for what I did but trust me, I hate myself more. To you I just hurt a random innocent person who was already beaten down. For me, I had hurt my closest friend. Someone I considered family when I had pushed all mine away. I have been since trying to eliminate all of my addicitons, reconnected with the SAME therapist and psychiatrist, and doing everything I can to be healthy so there are no excuses when it comes time to care and love for someone close to me again. I am fortunate enough to simply have been ignoring my real family, thinking I could never trust them, because to them I had simply stopped communicating and they were happy to have me back in their lives. I told them the truth about how I thought of them during these times but they didn't care. Just happy I wasn't hanging from the ceiling. I am so lucky and fortunate to have such a stable family, which is way better than having someone to pay the bill (thanks for doing the paperwork for my $100,000 student debt though).

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I'm hoping I can one day reconnect with this person. Because I'm a fucking idiot. That would never happen. But I was due for a serious lesson, and the pain is a helpful reminder. 

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR** I was a liar and addict, and I lied to myself about being a liar and an addict, which made it really easy to betray someone I thought I really loved. The collision of the truth of who I was and who I thought I was almost broke me completely, and I have been trying to rebuild who I am ever since. 

&amp;#x200B;

This all happened last Friday so, my bad if its a bit frantic. I was also so franticly desperate for my partner that I immediately got myself blocked by calling every night for a few days straight. But I was at least able to forward her an STD panel per her request that showed I was clear except for the one we already got and dealt with.

Your bf also has the right to make his own decisions regarding his health, and if those decisions aren't ones you can live with, you're allowed to leave.

That's selfish and cruel, but it is still a decision that he's allowed to make, unfortunately. Him not saying anything before is also shitty, but I can kinda see how that happened. He doesn't think it's that big of a deal, (which is kinda scary, tbh), so he didn't see a need to bring it up.

All in all, this situation sucks, because it seems as though there is a large difference in how you guys feel about this, and it is a BIG DEAL even if he doesn't think it is.

"et666zc","I'd like to talk about Illyana from alternate universes and how the way she's been portrayed there does a disservice to 616 Illyana.

In both House of M New X-Men and the Exiles series, the Illyanas we meet have a mean streak, if not downright villainous, even though they never grew up in Limbo.

In House of M New X-Men, we see a version of Illyana who takes pleasure in teleporting people into a volcano-like environment to terrify them. Even though she is heroic, she is the most ruthless good guy there.

In Exiles, she's self-serving, mean-spirited and eventually dies from her own foolishness in abandoning her team to side with the bad guys.

By portraying her this way even though these versions of her have never been abducted and raised in Limbo, it seems to suggest that there is an innate meanness in Illyana, as if Limbo didn't cause her to be at times ruthless and cruel, but that she would grow up to be this way all on her own.

Look man, I don't want to be cruel, but I have to be blunt. You need to stop thinking with your dick and wake up to the fact that this girl isn't nice or sweet. She's cruel and sadistic.

No one here is going to tell you that it's okay to ignore that she's a terrible person just because she lets you put your penis in her. I promise you there are plenty of other girls out there who will do that without the part where they publicly humiliate a girl they don't like for no reason.

Think about it this way: do nice people do the things she does? Is it sweet when she verbally abuses people in front of you? Is it kind when she tells you that questioning her actions means you don't care about her?

"et4ruml","I can give brief reasons for my reasoning on each, I know it's not very intuitive lol.

Kaiser: I really really don't like the way SIU frames her and her conflict. Tower morality be damned, she does not come off as sympathetic to me given her loyalties and choices and it really irks me that she's so easily accepted and forgiven by the main cast. Before Baam's fight with her, I also found her presence to be more boring than Inieta and the Twins, who were also more threatening. 

Beta: Just too edgy for my tastes.

Androssi: Was very good in Season 1, but her arc changes a lot in Season 2 to focus more explicitly on her relationship with Baam, which isn't as interesting as her kinship with Anak. She's also impulsive, violent, and cruel, but is still treated as a hero the way SIU frames things. Things were better when she knew she was a bad person, and people treated her like it. 

Ran: Forgot to add him in the brief list but for the same reason as Androssi: murderous and reprehensible, but treated as a hero. 

Yuri: She becomes a hindrance after reuniting with Baam on the Hell Train by forcing him to go to NHS. She's also very impulsive, and while her power is fierce and cool, she never faces a real challenge in a fight, and it's annoying to me that she comes out just as cocky and rash as she always is. It's not endearing anymore because Baam doesn't need her protection as much. I think she just exists to punch people and give one-liners. 

Yama: Just some really weird choices from SIU, having him sleep through the festival when he was so excited to see Deng Deng fight. 

Gustang: I didn't really like his role as a deus ex machina in the Floor of Death, nor am I into his cockiness, as powerful as he may be. 

Data Eduan: Just another cocky asshole, and an enormous missed opportunity. Really only exists to give Baam another training session.

"esis3pt","&gt; Once again, I don't mean to say he necessarily assaulted other women. But I am not comfortable with taking his apology at face value and forgiving him solely because ""it's been a long time"". 

I'm actually pretty done being forced into defending him.  I never intended to take this tack but you folks ""went hard in the paint"" as it were.  I think we've beaten it to death though.  But my motto is if I'm not willing to defend a person I don't want to defend as honestly as I can, then I've got no place in the discussion to start with.  This'll prolly be my final reply in the chain.  No harm, no hard feelings, no fouls though :).  

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; I'm not sure about that, and I need to see more proof. I would have been more convinced if he'd followed up the apology with a donation to an organization for victims of sexual assault, or taken some time to advocate against rape and for a better understanding of consent. 

This is DANGEROUS thinking.  To prove you are not a bad person you must become a front line soldier for our cause is some real scary stuff.  In the hands of your allies it's justice, in the hands of your enemies it's oppression.  It attempts to cleanse any middle ground or understanding between disparate sides with holy fire and you're left with only opposing groups of devout believers because everyone else has been cleansed or scared into a side.

It's the approach of zealots, and it's definitely an approach that is increasingly popular for the different sides of the different issues in this mob justice social media age.  People know not the fires they are playing with or how quickly they can turn upon oneself.  

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; That interview is from 2016 though. At that point he'd already made at least one private apology to someone for hurting her, so he must have known he behaved badly.  

That's the thing though, we cannot accuse him of the private apologies and then lying to the media because the private apologies are not the situations you quoted him responding to.  The article from gawker he said wasn't real was in reference to a hotel room incident.  Your conflating two disparate things.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; Honestly, I don't have an objective standard. Ideally, a proper justice system would decide, but I don't have much faith in our current one. Alternatively, the victims could be the ones to decide, they're the ones who were hurt after all. We're all just bystanders. But I get that could be complicated to arrange. 

So this may sound harsh and cruel, but the victims should also move on.  I've had earth shattering events in my life before.  I've had people horribly betray my trust, physically threaten me, people kick in the door of our family home when I was sleeping in the living room near that door, etc.  I've nearly been killed a few times, pulling another man out of the way of being hit by the drug induced lunatic on a rampage in his car trying to hit us.  

Things leave wounds on you, wounds don't always heal quickly or completely.  But you need to keep moving forwards and being a better and stronger you every day.  At 18 I was a leaf on the wind, brittle and on the verge of breaking.  I had no clue my childhood was real bad until I started talking about it as an adult.  There are certainly people who have had it worse, but I did not have it easy.  But I worked on it and myself.  I got stronger, more confident, fixed some issues, band-aided others until I could fix them later.  By the time I was 27 I was basically made of steel.  I have feelings, I care, I hurt, I bleed, but I'm used to it.  It's all minor, doesn't even register on the scale.  I have a happy life, like Mr Peanutbutter in Bojack Horseman only a little less frivolous and without the crippling nihilism and avoidance of responsibility and self.  People shudder at the events around them and I stand fast now, holding them up and picking up the pieces even as my own life may lay bleeding from the same event, then I patch myself up.  Because I can take it.

This did not happen overnight.  It was hundreds upon thousands of hours of effort, expanding horizons, and running into my own limits only to slowly surpass them.  From the age of 18 to 27 and beyond to a slowly getting older 35.  I start a pane of glass unable to help anyone.  I am now a rock that can be shelter for anyone but has a careful eye for who will erode away and who will move on stronger or help in return with a shoulder I don't specifically need...but can gratefully lean on and appreciate the luxury of.

Holding onto something for 14 years, that's not healthy.  Regardless of whether it's right or good or justice or what have you.  For that person, that victim, that's not healthy.  No event defines your life, though it can shift it's direction.  YOU definite your life, so long as you can choose how to live.  So this may sound harsh but I do see some of what Dave Chappelle said about brittle spirit has relevance here.

Likewise I can feel being tickled, but that doesn't have a relation to my pain threshold. Whipping doesn't break the skin. 

I know I haven't addressed all of your points but in my opinion they don't get any further than just saying ""you wouldn't like it if it was done to you,"" and confusing the treatment of horses in eventing and in horse racing, which is a notable difference. Also, it's worth actually reading about horse trainers and their techniques. It isn't all negative reinforcement, quite the opposite in fact. Horses in competition don't do anything they don't do in the wild (apart from in dressage which I personally don't find cruel but just strange), it is just the job of the trainer and the rider to make it do it on command. I don't find any difference in the training of horses and dogs.

"ern7qbl","I had to see this for myself, and I wasn't disappointed. One, yes dogs can digest grains and plant material. However, they do not break down as easily as meat does. Two, the only reason they're considered an omnivore is based on the fact that they are able to digest grains (so can wolves) and the fact that their intestinal tract is slightly above average for a carnivore. There's actually a split within the veterinarian community on wheter they should be considered carnivores instead of omnivores. Here's why.  

1. Their teeth are made for tearing and breaking down bone, carnivore.   

2. Similar to other mammalian carnivores, they are able to survive long periods between meals.  

3. Their bility to digest/consume grains comes from us and the many years we've spent donesticating dogs.  

In the end, could you feed a dog a meatless diet? Probably, but you're literally making harder on them and their digestive system. Dogs love meat, plain and simple. To proselytize veganism onto an animal that's designed to eat meat is not only cruel, but unethical too.

 But he seems to **want** to imply that his ancient Scottish blood gives him insight into how the Brits (meaning the stereotype of upper class south-eastern English) view others seeking to reference the historical treatment of the Scots by the English... I mean its a complete historical clusterfuck. Leaving aside the fact that he is American and has no insight into our history or culture whatsoever, even if he was Scottish those in glass houses shouldn't throw stones!

Or even to turn the classic scenario of the domineering English trying to suppress the Scots on its head he could look up how Malcom III of Scotland invaded England 3 times to try and capture the North for his own Kingdom, or how James IV invaded England. 

History is a complex web of events, and the relationship between England and Scotland is a complex and bloody one involving lots of different religious, cultural and ethnic groups **within** both England and Scotland, and over hundreds and hundreds of years both sides committed horrible atrocities, with the English giving the worst of it due to being the bigger, more powerful nation but the North of England suffered horribly under Scottish raids.

My doctor told me therapy is the most effective treatment and depending on the person sometimes some medication at low dosages combined with therapy works great. 

Medication has helped a lot of people of course but without therapy you are just masking the obsessions and compulsions. The doctor told me because of this people can get worse once off the medication.

Therapy helps you manage it and helps you at a much deeper level. It’s not just the compulsions but the intrusive thoughts you want to learn how to cope with.

He can get better trust me. I had pure-o since 5 and started compulsions in my teenage years. Last summer almost my every move involved a compulsion and I had so many rituals. 

Today i’m 20 and i’ve helped myself. I actually haven’t started therapy yet but with the power of my own mind I went from doing rituals every minute to doing only a couple a day.

&amp;#x200B;

I think if the last few seasons were as realistic as the first 5 or 6 (and didn't become a Danyfest), Dorne would've ended up winning the iron throne. No one backed Cersei anymore, she was hated by everyone and betrayed every kingdom loyal to her. Her plan to use the High Septon as a way to combat Tyrell's influence ended up backfiring and turning her own kingdom against her. Everyone knew by now she had no right to the throne, her children didn't belong to the king, and the only people loyal to her were the guards in her immediate vicinity. She was sitting alone, just waiting for someone to come knock her off the throne.

&amp;#x200B;

Meanwhile, Dorne had motivation for revenge. The Lannisters had killed Elia and Oberyn Martell, and it was probably believed they killed the prince Doran and his son. They also killed Ellaria and her daughters, although most probably didn't care as they were bastards. Dorne also was one of the few kingdoms who didn't expend their army in the fight with the north. They could've made allies with the remains of the southern kingdoms and easily taken Kings Landing, especially with the north preoccupied and devastated by white walkers.

&amp;#x200B;

Even if Dany does with the throne with her one dragon, her forces were crippled. She only started off with 8000 unsullied and 30,000 dothraki, which were likely cut in half. Dorne has also been shown to be cunning in dealing with dragons (who aren't as invincible as they are in the books). Seeing as the Dornish love using poisions, they could've poisoned a flock of sheep that Drogon ends up eating, while using guerrilla tactics against Dany's remaining armies.

Islam equates lack of foreplay and not being attuned to a women’s sexual needs animalistic and cruel.

Birds are either predator or prey and the parrot is the latter. It's tendency is to be cautious.

Parrot folks are usually sensitive and loving (at heart), because that's what it takes to build a relationship (bond) with them.

In nonlinear fashion, the records reveal how Danny Brown the child became Danny Brown the hip-hop spectacle, from witnessing his uncle smoking crack in the kitchen to selling drugs himself, from his decade-long struggle to build a music career to the stress of expectation and scrutiny once he’d finally made it. In order, the story goes Old side A, XXX, Atrocity Exhibition, and finally Old side B. Drugs are the constant throughout, the root of Brown’s trauma becoming his coping mechanism in a cruel but familiar twist of irony.

"eirm4ht","Dew claws can be largely vestigial in some dogs and semi-functional in others. Some dogs their dew claws can touch the ground and the nail will get worn down. They can have slightly better traction in mud and snow. Other dogs it sits higher up and the nail needs regular trimming. In others it may not have bone and therefore it is entirely useless and doesn't help grip, like when they chew bones or hold items in their paws. I had a dog who had no bone structures in her dew claws and she half-ripped off one and the vet removed the rest of the dew claw and recommended we remove the other one as she was likely to catch it as well and it would be painful and she was at high risk to damage it. She benefited from dew claw removal on the other leg after she ripped one off.

Another dog did whip her tail so hard she broke it. The vet who took it off said there was no reason her primary veterinarian had no recommended removal. By the time he saw her the entire last two inches of her tail had lost most of the bloodflow at was at risk of necrotizing. She'd broken it and based on how short her fur was and breed of dog being more prone to tail injuries the vet was a little mad they hadn't docked because it was more painful for her to have a tail she was constantly hurting and the blood and bone structures were more developed so he couldn't remove too short because she'd bleed too much. So she ended up with like a four inch long nub instead of a two inch one and it constantly hit when she would sit and she had to adjust for her awkward nub of a tail.

Sometimes dogs benefit. She was a hunting breed with very short fur and a long, thin whip of a tail that whacked until she broke it badly and the first vet we never went back to because they said she was fine and she could've gone spetic over their mis-handling of it.

"ehk54jb","&gt; Making the people that never managed to get out of poverty feel like they could have done so if they just made better choices and tried harder is both cruel and inaccurate if there is no free will.

It's cruel, but not inaccurate. I mean, if somebody dies in poverty because of bad choices they have made, it's not an untrue statement to say they probably wouldn't have died in poverty had they made different choices. Sort of like saying somebody wouldn't have gotten mauled if they wouldn't have wandered into a lion's den.

When somebody in poverty thinks they're absolutely fucked regardless of what choices they make, THAT is a victim mentality. And telling someone, 'you know, if you just put the little bit of money left over at the end of your paycheck into savings instead of blowing it on cigarettes and boos, these kinds of small decisions stacked on top of each other can make a HUGE difference in how your life turns out', could make the difference in whether that person stays in poverty for the rest of their lives or not.

"ehjqtv3","Hey man,

I'm sorry that you're going through this. I know what it feels like to think the life is dark, miserable and painful. I'll just add some of my thought below.

First of all I'd advise you to stay away from ""The Red Pill"" because even though they are somewhat right about certain things they basically turn you into an asshole. I mean the rhetoric is basically ""Girls are assholes. So it's okay for you to be one too."".  I mean not all women are assholes and neither are most men.

In terms of women valuing you only when they feel like you could leave at any moment is problematic. Loyalty and trust are key things for a relationship. Living in fear that your partner could dip any moment is pretty shitty for both men and women especially when you're in an established LTR. 

In regards to opening up to people, it's a slippery slope. A lot of people feel uncomfortable talking about emotions especially those of other people. Generally the longer the amount of time you spend with someone the more likely they'll support you if you do say something. This also isn't a gender thing, from my personal experience both men and women can respond badly to being opened up to and it's often because they don't know what to say or what to do. I mean you are changing their opinion of you and adding more depth to the version of you they believe in. From what I've seen insecure people tend to respond the worst which may describe why your ex-gf left you.

Anyway, I don't know if I've convinced you  but I hope I have.

"edoyb9u","Since Bakugou Vs Deku there have been a number of arc which have meant to feel urgent.


When the raid starts in the Overhaul arc it is actually fast paced and while there is a lot of mini battles most are within 3 chapters and the intermissions are actually pretty snappy. It grinds down near the end by the time Izuku comes up against Overhaul because of flashbacks, Eri hot-potato shenanigans, jumping around to see what's happening with the League, Overhaul flashbacks and imo a bit too many panels of Izuku's internal monologue about managing OfA.  The fight is over before it barely begins once Eri and Izuku start working together but the pacing is frantic and choppy that it feels more confusing and chaotic than epic. 
Rather than not feeling the urgency of saving Eri and everyone not dying, it got exhausting and messy, constantly getting new dangers/stakes thrown at us (NightEye saying he saw Izuku's death, Eri using her Quirk on Izuku, Overhaul becoming a chimera monster, the battlefield flying everywhere, people getting lost on the battlefield/Aizawa being kidnapped) as well as big information dumps literally up to the very last punch. It was bloated and dense and really felt it was crumbling under the weight of everything it set up and was then trying to handle far too quickly. 


The chapters following that were either Light Heart (the licences course arc was fun and rewarding) or wallowed in the unpleasant aftermath of the Overhaul arc with Izuku lack of self worth and confidence making him relatively glum. He needed to go through that but it's not much fun to read although they're not bad chapters with plenty of interesting stuff happening with other characters but a sad Izuku affects the tone. 



The cultural festival arc also tried to have a sense of urgency and stakes but I was more invested in seeing Izuku improved abilities and action than I really cared about what he was fighting to ""protect"", mainly as I did not buy into Izuku's great urgency since there were teachers there who would have stopped Gentle. They even catch him on school grounds and don't stop the festival so the stakes were perhaps over hyped and tried to oversell how much Izuku was doing all he could for Eri to smile that it bordered on Obnoxious even if it was adorable. I don't like the term ""try hard"" but it did feel like the story was really trying to rub it in how essential Izuku's actions were for Eri's sake, much like the Overhaul arc did but the premises still feels tenuous. In the Overhaul arc, as poetic as it is that the coincidence of Izuku holding Eri had such a profound impact on her and only he could save her, it's built on a random coincidental encounter and on top of that Mirio already saved her before she went back in the penultimate climax - it really felt like events and actions were written in a convoluted way so that Izuku could be important, it's not as convincing or compelling as Izuku wanting to prove himself against Bakugou, pulling crazy stunts in the sports festival, learning full cowl, protecting Iida, going against All Might and having to work with Bakugou.  Maybe because those previous thinks felt like there were about Deku and what he wanted was on the line.  
Overhaul and Gentle is more about Deku doing stuff for others, which is noble but with Overhaul it feels like he's picking up Mirio's fight and with Gentle there is a bit too much justifying what and why Deku is doing what he is doing and kind of trying to match it to Gentle (both fighting for someone else) that I felt like the writing was trying to tell me the might mattered more than I felt the fight mattered. Compare it to Deku and Kacchan 2 or even AfO and All Might, those fights aren't trying to sell why their important, they're much more character driven. Deku and Kacchan the fight was meaningless but the emotions and truths were extremely important and moving. In AfO and AM we got a taste of how nasty and cruel but also parental AfO is while go through a emotional journey with AM.  Deku's fights with Overhaul and Gentle had none of that and these fights were kind of the ""pay out"" for their respective arcs and did not really feel worth it.


The recent arc with the battles between 1B and 1A feel more serviceable and okay, with good to great updates for the characters, entertaining and enjoyable even world expanding and informative moments  but don't really kick off with much emotional pay out until we get to chapter 208 where not only is the art kicked up several notches in a way we've not seen since the Overhaul arc (double spreads galore) but Bakugou finally get's his full victory and we have pay out from Deku and Kacchan 2 fight- this reddit is a poor reflection with how much love and excitement most fans felt over that match, it was trending on twitter and all over tumblr. Then it's followed by Izuku in distress. It's more engaging when its about things that personally matter or are important to the characters we care about.

"eax10y6","I'm a cosmic nihilist and a capitalist. I know capitalism is exploitative and downright cruel, but I don't think redistribution of wealth will be the cure for nihilism. 

Here's simply why: money is a societal construct. Post-WWI most countries switched to Fiat currency. Basically: pre-WWI, money was based on gold and silver. Paper money was simply bearer bonds; you would deposit gold in a bank and the bank would give you a bearer bond which read (paraphrased) ""this paper is good for $___ worth of gold"". You could take that paper to the bank and they would give you its worth of gold.

After WWI, Germany was under heavy debt and they suffered massive inflations (so much so that burning money was cheaper than burning wood during the winters). So, they left behind the system of gold and went with the Fiat currency system. In it, paper money has value because the government says it has value. And everyone else has collectively agreed for a fixed value of it.

You can read more about it in Liaquat Ahmed's Lord of Finance. When money no longer is a ""cause"" for nihilism, something else will take its place. There is historic evidence of it, too! It's called Taylorism.

Taylorism was named after Frederick Winslow Taylor. He created a system of scientific management. To increase productivity for businesses, Taylor would scientifically recreate the work environment by moving machinery in a way that the process of making products was faster (if you're thinking about mass production, you're pretty close. Although it was Henri Ford who provided the system for mass production based on Taylorist principles). He then introduced flexible wages for workers. He would pay the workers based on how much work they have done (this was called the piece rate system). The more product you made, the more you earn. He paid the workers a lot higher than any other business would. I don't recall the exact figure, but I think he raised salaries by 30% or so.

So, people earned more and worked harder. But then they still felt alienated. They claimed that they felt like small, replaceable cogs in the giant corporate machine. By the 1930s (about 30 yards after the introduction Taylorism) labour turnover rate was at a record high.

I think that nihilism is the cost of sentience. Because we are thinking beings, if we think rationally, we will contemplate our own insignificance. It's not money, it's not family, it's just the cost of our sentience. At least, in my book.",1543753344,"i know capitalism is exploitative and downright cruel, but i don't think redistribution of wealth will be the cure for nihilism.","cruel, but i","cruel","but",TRUE,"exploitative and downright cruel","exploitative","downright",NA,0

"eai7htu","There are two good solutions I know. The first is very, very cruel, but effective; make it so battling consumes some resource. That way, grinding or sidequesting puts your whole save at risk, because you might not have enough resources to finish the game. The main problem with this approach is that it's not beginner-friendly at all, and punishes heavily any major mistake. But, given the right setting and balance, this can work.

The second is simply to not reward the player with power. Instead, why not unlock more of the lore or story? Why not unlock a new playstyle? Or a map shortcut? Or a new savepoint/ heal station or whatever, right before a boss? This is the Nintendo approach, skipping or trimming difficulty spikes instead of trivializing the whole experience. 

Also, a point to consider. If the sidequests themselves are particularly challenging or interesting, it might be okay to let the player steamroll the main quest. It's a reward for the player's finesse; he's able to speedrun the story that likely was already played before, and get to the other interesting challenges faster.",1543245606,"the first is very, very cruel, but effective; make it so battling consumes some resource.","cruel, but effective","cruel","but",TRUE,"very cruel , but effective","effective","very",NA,1

"ea6lujn","&gt;Moreover, I am asking the reader, for the sake of argument, to accept here that while the statement ""taxes are theft"" gets popularly and heavily downvoted here on reddit, that statements like ""civil asset forfeiture is theft"" and ""criminalizing cannabis is tyranny"" and other statements which reflect a belief in a set of laws or mores higher than the law of the land (which is the fundamental disagreement which ""taxes are theft"" libertarians are expressing).


I think there is a disconnect here with what two people see as ""fundamental"" rights. On the one hand many people take issue with the statement ""taxation is theft"" if for no other reason than trying to fund our society as it is now would require massive changes and may even be impossible. This is unsettling and because of this many people try to work the argument backwards from there such that it would make sense that ""taxes are not theft"".  Likewise there are many who dislike what the government does, how it operates and the fact that they pay taxes. Perhaps without realizing they also work backwards from various starting principles until they find a foundational set of beliefs from which they derive the notion that ""taxes are indeed theft"".  


Unfortunately since these two people are coming at the problem with different foundational beliefs they are likely to have irreconcilable differences as they place different weights of validity on the same logical statements and derive ""basic truths"" from different sources. **Bear in mind that when I attempt to explain the hipocracy I am subject to the same flaw and we will likely not agree on the explanation, but perhaps we can at least agree that the hipocracy is reduced to a minimum.**


For instance I could argue that the government's right to do anything derives from the consent of the governed, but that consent does not necessarily empower you directly, but rather the collective as a whole.  If the collective decides an action is worthwhile and ""right"" then it is, because ""we"" consent for it to be that way, while you individually may not.  Likewise we have consented that individuals be given various rights and privileges, these should not be confused as being foremost as again we have consented that those rights can be suspended at any time if we decide that is necessary. 


Where we get tripped up with this line of thinking though is in the assumption that our consensus on various issues is somehow consistent, which it is absolutely not.  Which is why it is also perfectly acceptable for people to petition to change things, and perfectly acceptable for you to argue that taxes are they, however I'm not convinced there is a ""moral truth"" as two people's ""moral truths"" can differ. Which is why we try to govern by majority consent. Of course we run the risk of tyranny by majority, which is why we consented to additional protections.


To the point of hipocracy many would say that taxes affect everyone and we collectively consent to this action as it benefits us all collectively, perhaps not optimised or to the liking of one individual, but the same goes for an arrest of a person.


The issue many take with civil forfeiture is that unlike taxes it treats objects as culpable. The money cannot defend itself in court and is presumed guilty until proven innocent, which is the inverse of our collective consent with regards to criminal indictments.  This is an example of the collective consensus acting inconsistently, and therefore is up to some debate and legal interpretation.  Additionally, unlike taxes civil asset forfeiture is not a thing one can plan for, like taxes, it could be considered cruel but certainly unusual punishment as you are taking so amounts of money and property from people without charging them with any crime and there isn't a clear benefit to the rest of the community as a result of that action. This may be defensible if for instance The person whose property it was has been indicted, but instead the money/property itself is charged. In your tax example it would be as though your bank account were charged without tax evasion as a result of suspected tax evasion and seized in its entirety as a result.


Essentially the ""consent"" to civil assert forfeiture suffers from many many inconsistent derivations of ""consent."". Whereas taxes are much more clear, and in fact the authority to impose taxes is granted by the Constitution, which is one of the few things we collectively consent to with regularity.  The right of the government to impose civil asset forfeiture is a loophole in the web of consent intricacies we have made for ourselves with this system of government, and deciding the answers to these questions is the role of the court system, unfortunately as part of this loophole money or houses are not afforded a lawyer in court and cannot represent themselves which makes this problem particularly difficult to hash out in a way that we collectively agree on.



All that said since I expect we disagree that our collective rights are more important than individual rights the above does not necessarily hold. I feel it's worth pointing out that I'm also aren't from a pragmatic point of view in that without a government or society to give you rights, you couldn't really say that you have them to begin with. Sort of a ""if a tree falls in the woods"" thing.

That's the thing about narcs that often makes it impossible to have a close relationship with them. They are way too destructive and cruel. 

But remember that she cannot erase your progress. She took 10 steps back, not you. Why do you think she got so mad at you? It was because you were making her look bad. You cleaned your room spotless and then you went and picked up her slack in parenting. I have a mom just like yours and one thing that hurts to realize: she does not want to see you do better than her. She will get jealous and sabatoge you even though she will never admit it. 

The key is to distance yourself until you are much much more steady emotionally. Or distance yourself forever, whichever you want. I'm glad to hear that you have plans to move out. Until then, just do the classic ignoring/stonewalling/keeping to yourself. That works too. She is a weight around your neck right now and as soon as you get rid of her, I bet you will see even more progress.

I have a 16 year old sister and I do a lot for her with no complaints, but if she treated me the way your brother treated you, I would leave her to herself. The way he spoke to you is unforgivable and it shows how desperate he is *not* to accept your help. The best and the only thing to do right now is to remove yourself from him as well. Work only on your own  well-being for now. That is something I have struggled with. My brother, the golden child, recently also told me to kill myself over a small argument where I was trying to help him. At that point I realized that he is way too far gone for me to help.

When you’ve been together as long as you have I would normally try and suggest things to work on, but unfortunately it sounds like there were big issues you left unaddressed from the start. Many of these things literally do seem “irreconcilable.”

For example:

&gt;We have always fought

Due to the media dramatizing things I feel like some people get this idea where it's seen as normal for couples to have all these wild ups and downs, and that's supposed to be because of the ""passion"" in your relationship. Except it's not. Yes, some disagreements and fights are normal, but they should be handled in a mature manner and fairly infrequent in a healthy relationship. If you've fought throughout the *entirety* of your relationship and only ever gotten back to ""okay"" on top of that, that is not a normal or okay thing.

&gt;He hates my friends, my hobbies and never cares to notice how hard I work or my volunteer activities

Being neutral toward some of your partner's friends or interests is fine, but actively ""hating"" them and not even recognizing how or why they make your partner happy is just rude and unsupportive. He should be able to make the effort to share in your excitement over these things at least occasionally.

&gt;I want to go to therapy with him to work on our communication, but he refuses.

Okay, so... you recognize there are problems in the marriage, have told him as much, (I assume) communicated that you need him to work on these things to be happy and his response was to tell you that he doesn't want to do that, and thus doesn't care about your needs. Does that sound like a loving and considerate partner to you?

&gt;He's kicked me out of the house before, with our child

Even if I ignored every other glaring red flag before this, this fact right here makes his behavior entirely unacceptable. Kicking you out is insanely inconsiderate, unfair and cruel, but to do that to YOUR CHILD on top of things? No no no.  That shows a complete lack of responsibility and maturity. It verges on abusive, and I hope you've had a good long think on what that communicates to your child about what's acceptable in a relationship, special needs or no.

You can't make this man love you back when he's continually shown he doesn't care about your needs. And to be frank, I think you've been in this relationship for so long that you're unable to see how much better things could be. You've been together from a young age, and this has become your bar for ""love"" now. It's a sad thing that this level of disregard and inconsideration has become normalized for you, but to be sure, it is *not* normal or loving.

When the world was nearing its end the God Eaters were the only ones fighting to keep the boulder rolling, to preserve not only their own existence but that of all life.

I mean, think about people who say that there shouldn't be same sex marriage because it takes away from heterosexual marriage.  How does it do that?  I can't understand it.  They say stuff like ""Marriage needs to be for making families and only men and women can do that.""  Well, if that's the case, you shouldn't get married until you're going to make a baby, period -- full stop.  Right?  No baby, no marriage.  Infertile couples can't get married.  End of discussion, right?  No.  No one would say that.  That's just stupid and cruel.  But is it?  Look at the original assertion of opponents to same sex marriage.  What are they really saying?

So yes.  Let's instead say that love is the thing that sanctifies marriage.  No love, no marriage.  Much nicer that way.

"e7dlws3","Even from the beginning though there were quests having Forsaken players raising new undead. The whole point of their story was that they were cursed, wouldn't wish their curse on any one and wanted revenge against the powers that cursed them.

They join the Horde for protection against the Alliance and other factions that want them destroyed not because they fear death, but because they want to stay alive long enough to get their revenge. Which they do. They defeat the Lich King. But who created the Lich King? The Legion. So they still have someone to hate. Plus there would be Forsaken who just want to protect the planet and their loved ones even if they have been abandoned/shunned.

Wasn't that the point of the Horde originally? The orcs were savage but they were a noble savage. The trolls were outcasts. The tauren were being wiped out by enemies and no one else would help. The Forsaken are tragic and slightly cruel but not evil.

"e7dh3dv","Haven't heard from her in just over five months. Sometimes I think it's cruel but other times I think it's probably good for both of us.  I imagine she's probably checked on me without my knowing, but maybe not?  We were together for the 7 years, engaged for 2.  I'd like to think our relationship meant enough to her that she occasionally checks to make sure I'm still alive and haven't relapsed (I haven't btw).  

Her mom liked a picture I was tagged in last night so I'm sure she's heard about me dating again.  
Her friend randomly showed up a couple weeks ago to ""let me know they were selling a house down the street""?  wtf does that mean?  Other than those two things, radio silence.  

It sucks though because I've finally gotten the willpower to finish sorting through the basement and I have a rather large pile of her stuff.  Some is probably trash, but some of it is memories that I wouldn't want to lose if I was in her shoes.  

I guess I'm probably going to have to be the one that breaks NC in a few days/weeks?  I don't want to because it feels awkward given the situation (she left me in the worst way possible) but I suppose it needs to be done.  I would personally love if she would contact me first because honestly, I'll always love her.  Maybe not as a lover, but as a person I had some really good times with, and some really bad times.  It's tough to hate a person after that much history.  

I was willing to forgive her the day of, and I still would today but I don't know if she cares about me anymore.   I think there's hope sometimes that she'll come around and realize what an awful series of decisions she's made, other times I'm a bit more cynical and think she's probably completely over me.  I'd really like to talk to her without having to be the one who calls first.  

But that's just me.

"e7dbw59","Just to make myself clear , Stalin started his career as a bank robber as far as i know , literally a brutal cruel violent thug , evil by any reasonable definition of the word...however , he signed a nonagression pact with Hitler ONLY after the allies did the same , and after repeated requests to the allies to gang up on the Nazis when they took Cheoslovakia.

The notion that the Holdomor was an intentional genocide originated with the Ukrainean nazis. It was thoroughly discredited in western academia post WW2 and has been resurected now to beat RUssia over the head with. Yes Stalin and his policies exacerbated the problem , mostly by bulying there political underlings and making them fear to report the truth , so his economic plans were built on ussualy very inflated food production numbers , when he demanded the portion he demanded, many were left starving. He did kill and opress many of the local nobility/large landowners aswell when those said landowners decided to burn crops and kill livestock rather then give it to the govt.

Where did you get the ideea that he wanted to join the axis powers though? They were soo diametrically oposed in ideology , the soviets and the nazis , that any sort of alliance seems a nonsense. Explicitly on the point of racism , while it was institutionalized in Germany , it was literally criminalized in the soviet union . Implying any race is superior to any other was a crime there.

Stalin DID turn the soviet union in an industrial powerhouse to rival Germany. Hitler had not really realized this , his notions about RUssia were based on the German experience , and Russia achieved in some 20 years what Germany , UK , USA and the rest needed some 80 years to do , from feudalism to full industrialization , after a cataclismic civil war , a desastrous loss in WW1 and the subsequent invasion from the western powers..remember that? WHile costing millions of lives , his cruel but efficient pollicies were literally what made the victory possible in the first place. He was no champion of peace , none of the relevant powers in WW2 were , if you believe any different you probably believe propaganda , none held back from slaughtering millions of innocents if it brought them closer to victory. 

All moral judgements aside though ,  i dont think it s contested that if Russia had not rushed and forced -industrialized,  they would have lost to the Germans and would have been literally wiped out as a people. I dont know of any country on earth that doesnt celebrate leaders that literally saved them from extintion , i dont know of many coutries that literally faced extinction , the next things that come to mind were those that faced the mongols.

And no , the industrial scale slaughter of millions is not the same as millions starving in one of the ciclical famines that ravaged the regions for many centuries , especially when the Soviets did attempt there best to solve the problem once they became aware of the scope of it. 

edit : A clear example of propaganda is the notion that the societ invasion of Finland failed. It did not , it was a succes , it achieved every strategic objective it set to achieve. It was a bloody costly mess , as the army s officer core had been gutted and politicians made military decisions , at least in the begining , but it was a sign of things to come , in that the RUssians would throw manpower at an issue untill the issue ceased to be an issue , and it brought the russian army what could be argued to be game changing experience in combined weapons warfare. Another is to call the nonagression pact they had with the nazis an alliance , while ignoring the fact that the allies did the same before , and that they refused (Polland specifically) to allow russian troops to pass and defend Chehosolovakia when it was given as an offering to the Nazis by the alies . I wonder , is that part mentioned ?


edit 2 : Another thing to note is that he didnt take ther efood to kill them , it wasnt a cartoon villain move , he took a bunch of food from rural areas to feed the millions he sort-of forcibly relocated into the towns to man up the new industries. As in China , forced fast paced industrialization did achieve records in speed and efficiency, but at the cost of millions of preventable deaths. However , that s different from literally slaughtering people because of some racial ideology. It was cruel and evil in the same way capitalism is cruel and evil for letting millions die while the resources to save them (medicine, etc) are readely available. Someone dying today because he has no access to insulin or some other medicine that exists stocked up in huge ammounts in his own country is not all that different from someone dying in the 1930's from lack of access to bread while large ammounts of bread are stored up and available in his own country , and are both vastly different fromrounding people up to shoot them because of the shape of there ears or noses.",1538964899,"while costing millions of lives , his cruel but efficient pollicies were literally what made the victory possible in the first place.","cruel but efficient","cruel","but",FALSE,"cruel but efficient","efficient",NA,NA,1

As is it’s basically been a full game and is 100% worth it. The mods are awesome too. 

My favorite story is my colony that banded together to experiment on surviving attacking tribes so my doctor could gain enough experience to add bionic back legs to our mascot dog, who was bitten by snakes while defending her puppies from death. Even save scumming couldn’t prevent some type of tragedy. This was a cruel, but best case scenario world line. 

A lot of dark things happened to make that happen. But they would carry her wherever she needed to be to eat and sleep, and it was debatably for the greater good. We’d survive farming, hunting, and selling organs. 

Eventually, he was able to remove and reattach pegs legs. By the end we had some four pegged humans we sold to passing slave traders, probably as tables or something. It messed with the psyche of some of my colony, atrocities and all that, but a psychopath made the prison duties and body hauling tolerable for everyone’s mood. 

Then the fateful day came, and the surgery was a success. Our dog could walk again. And it was beautiful. She ran around with her grown puppies. It was awesome.

"e5e6bmt","First Part:

In the late 80's I attended a small-ish religious college.  I was very gay and very closeted.  I chose the college because I hoped it would 'cure' me of my homosexuality. In the fall semester I became very close friends with a female classmate.  We had some basic classes together and both sung in the college choir. I had always had an innate ability to tell exactly what someone was feeling.  I just thought that everyone could do this, that feelings were transparent.  I think it was the reason I was so scared of being found out as gay because I thought others could obviously see it in me. I didn't have many friends in high school and I was always seen as the weird kid, kind and nice, but definitely weird.

&amp;#x200B;

But back to my new friend. She almost always had a sunny disposition, but as the semester wore on, I could see stress and depression building up in her. I tried to question her about it and she would brush off any questions with an expression of that she had no idea what I was talking about. But by November it was making me crazy to be around her... I kept feeling needles and pins in my finger tips when we sat together in class. So at lunch I took her to a quiet place and told her I knew that she wasn't fine, that she was stressed and depressed.

Again she tried to laugh it off, but I persisted and she became very quiet for a while. Then she admitted that she was fighting off depression because she was in love with someone just like me.

&amp;#x200B;

I didn't understand at first, but she told me that this guy was a junior and called himself an empath, someone who could read feelings just like me. Then it made sense to me, because I knew who she was talking about. He was also in the choir.  All the girls were wild about him, and most of the guys too. My friend had started to become depressed when she began to hang around with him.

&amp;#x200B;

I told her that she needed to think of herself and get over him. But she told me it wasn't that easy, that she had tried. We got into a huge argument over it and we actually didn't talk for a week. It was at this time that this guy began to take an interest in me, trying to chat me up after practices, but I was somewhat afraid of him. He had a dark cloud around him and it frightened me. It was something else that I could do, see the light or dark in people, even before knowing them. To me, he definitely tilted to the dark side.

&amp;#x200B;

One day my friend began sitting with me at class again. After a few days she told me that he wanted to talk to me, that he knew what my fear was. I had a weird feeling, like being scared and excited all at once. A few days later he knocked on my dorm room around 11 PM.  It was a weeknight because the campus was all shut down already. There wasn't any partying at this college. 

&amp;#x200B;

We went to the track and walked for over an hour. He told me all about himself and what he could do. He read me down to the bottom of my spirit. He knew that I was gay and I had a deep self-hatred, but that I was also a very hopeful person which is what kept me in an uneasy balance. He said he could help me learn not only how to read people but manipulate them as well. He said he could drive the daemons out of me. He grabbed my arms and pushed me down onto the track, kissed me and then 'spoke tongues' over me. 

&amp;#x200B;

He told me that what I could be was all up to what I wanted. I told him that I didn't want to be gay, but he said that until I owned up to my own darkness I would be miserable. The kiss had unbalanced me. It was the first real kiss by a guy I had ever had. I said I didn't believe him and that he was just making everything up.  

&amp;#x200B;

He just laughed at that and told me to pick anyone in the campus, male, female, student, teacher and that he'd have them all wrapped up around him within a week. I went back to my dorm thinking about this. I decided to pick the most unavailable person. The college had a big church in its campus and the assistant dean preached there. He had a 16 year old daughter that everyone knew was off-limits. She was very pretty and knew it and her dad made it clear that none of the male students would ever date her.

&amp;#x200B;

I told the guy I had picked her, thinking that this would never happen. But in two weeks he was not only dating her, but bragging to me about having sex with her upstairs while her father was downstairs.  I didn't believe him and then one Sunday I was invited to dinner at the assistant' dean's place and it was very clear that this guy and the daughter were having sex and everyone else was oblivious to it. 

&amp;#x200B;

The guy then began pressing me on coming out, even though I knew that if I did, I'd be kicked out of the school (being gay was actually on their list of expellable offenses). This pressure led to some really unpleasant stuff towards the end of the semester that led all three of us, my initial friend, him, and myself in front of the dean. Between her and him, they convinced the dean that I was mentally unstable (not true), and gay (true).

&amp;#x200B;

I left before my finals and had to undergo psychiatric evaluation and then I could only come back if I began therapy to 'cure' my homosexuality, to which I agreed. I took my finals in January and resumed classes. I became obsessed with this guy though, who had suddenly began acting as if I did not exist. My original friend did too. She seemed like an emotional zombie now anyway and I made new friends. I had auditioned for a play and got a small part.

One of the crew took an interest in me.  She was also kind of weird like me, but she had an unsettling way of knowing exactly what anyone was thinking and she knew that I was obsessed with this guy. Obsessed now that he wasn't talking to me.  I would just go and hang out wherever he was, just on the periphery. 

&amp;#x200B;

She told me that I would be better just ignoring him because she could see that he was manipulative and cruel, but in a way that no one ever could really notice. My life began to get better.

"e5dpl86","I looked around the room, and immediately started to wonder if he already knew. The castle motifs, the name of the place, even Gwen's gown screamed of old. Heck, the fact they were both here told me the odds were high. It had only been a few years since I crawled out of my grave, and I'd only heard about him recently, but he was a force to be reckoned with.

Maybe I should step back. I can't explain everything, but I can tell you it was all real: Arthur, Camelot, the Black Knight, the honor and the shame, all of it. And when Arthur rose up, to reclaim his throne, well it was a ripple effect. We all started coming back. Galahad won't return, I know that. Not sure about all the others, but I don't really have a choice.

They say he was found on a beach, half dead, and while I found records of him growing up here, and it was assumed an accident while he was on holiday led to him being on the beach, I did some research. No one knew him before. I took advantage of my immortality and some stolen equipment to check his grave, and it was empty. Then I started research. He was not quite as I expected. He'd establish his own empire here, a ways south of the old grounds of Camelot, but near the modern seat of power. He had a few, very skilled men in his employ to keep things running smoothly. And while his rep was as a crimelord, he was beloved by the local community. 

Meanwhile, I had worked my way to London and taken a different path. Somehow, I had a history in the databases, multiple degrees, and surprisingly, I seem to have the knowledge in my head when I need it. I ended up working with law enforcement as an external consultant. Oddest bit is, with my old accent, I sound foreign to them. Most think American, though I've never been.

So last week, they called me in to help with the case against Artie Pendragon, and I had to check my reaction. After looking over the files, I confirmed that it was no coincidence. He was there, with Gwen at his side, along with a half dozen of the other Knights of the Round Table. I was supposed to help the bobbies take him down, and I could pull it off if I wanted. But I remember what it felt like, to have purpose. To be part of something bigger.

I made my approach, but missed him as he slipped into the back. Oh well, I'd just start elsewhere.

""Hello, Gwen,"" I said, judging her reaction, trying to pick up if she remembered in her microexpressions. 

""I like the shaved look. Almost didn't recognize you. I'm hoping he didn't."" Okay, don't need to worry about microexpressions. 

""Yeah, it was easier to get work without all the hair and beard. Plus, far less itching. And it looks better with a suit.""

""You never could take a hint. I want you to leave.""

""Well, that's no way to talk to an old friend. Why would you want me to leave.""

""Because he doesn't remember.""

""I'm sorry, what?"" 

""He. Does. Not. Remember.""

""And that's good because...?"" 

""Maybe you don't remember, either. The business with Lancelot?"" 

""Ah, I see,"" I said, not even trying to hide the cruel grin creeping onto my face. ""Still not handling things like adults? Well, unfortunately, my dear—"" 

""I don't really care,"" Arthur's voice spoke from behind me. Not Artie's with the odd accent, but Arthur's. It still had that power behind it. ""Merlin, it's good to see you.""

""You...remember?"" She looked terrified. Of course, he'd nearly killed her last time.

""Did you know I was conscious,"" he said to me, ignoring her for the moment. ""The whole time I was aware. And it gave me a lot of time to think. I know she loves me. More importantly, I know I love her. I was young, and foolish, and hurt. My reactions was impulsive and cruel. But I forgive her. I just hope she can forgive me."" He turned to face her with the last line, holding out a hand, which she took. 

""So, how long have you remembered?"" I asked. 

""I never forgot. Advantage of never really slumbering.""

""And you, dear lady?"" 

""The moment I saw him.""

""Ah, very well. You do realize you are under investigation for criminal activities, yes, Artie?"" 

He gave that grin that told me things were about to be worth writing about. ""I may have a plan, if you're willing to help.""

If you use dragon piercer your goal is to hit the monster from tip to tail. You should be hitting the part of the monster that is weakest to your type of damage. Sometimes for ranged that is the wings, sometimes it is the head. Do be aware that players will intercept your arrows and can get staggered by them. Since you are ranged, you can easily dash around them to avoid shoving an entire power shot up their arse. https://hunters-guide.herokuapp.com/ This site will tell you what parts are weak to what kind of damage if you click on the monster image.

Rock shot will stagger a player if they don't have any flinch free. If you drop rock shot on the monster's head (where it is most useful for its impact damage), you will stagger anyone trying to also attack the head as melee. This is especially annoying if you shower the entire head with rocks during downed DPS phase. If you play with friends who use flinch free 1 (I think that's enough, probably just experiment with your friend), you should be good to shower the rocks all over the place.

"e3rw3jv","I view money as a necessary evil. It leads to greed, and lust for power... or at least the abuse of it does. I think the whole concept is problematic, too, in how it can be systemically exploited. When it isn't backed by anything but 'goodwill' is is just collective delusion that keeps it worth anything, and that inevitably leads to ruin. There have been more than enough examples of economies spiraling out of control because of rampant abuse of money generation, run away inflation, etc.

The nature of the 'game of money' is unsettling too... because it is naturally designed to lead to people losing the game. Just like the board game Monopoly, the more of an advantage you get, the more you can continue to take from others, and increase your advantage, and get more.... while others lose and lose and get lost in the shuffle. It is sad. It doesn't need to be so ruthless and cruel. But that is the game we play. What's really troubling is that unlike Monopoly, we don't ever get to start over, this game just keeps going throughout the generations and most of the 'new players' that join are starting off in a losing position.

I think there are people who use money as a tool to control others, and I am fundamentally opposed to infringements on the sovereignty of the human spirit. If it is a tool used to exploit people, I stand against it. That said... I know perfectly well how established it is in our societal system. There is no practical method of eliminating money that wouldn't cause more harm than good, at least in the short term. And so, it must stay. It must continue to corrupt and exploit and be a tool used by the powerful to keep a stranglehold on that power. Because eliminating it would be even worse than that.

But anyone who gleefully plays the money game is my moral opposition. I find it repugnant. I understand the allure, but I think people who succumb to it are weak.

Evil and cruel but not brave enough to stand up for what he believes in once Voldemort's gone. Then there's the weak, Wormtail, need I say more?! Haha also, it's not made very clear how many actual death eaters there really are, in GoF there's like what 8 that turn up in the graveyard? He mentions a few that have died or who were captured but really not that many, more seem to pop up in DH but again not a lot, and I think the issue is that quite a lot of people don't count as official death eaters, people like Narcissa Malfoy. She's technically not a death eater yet she's at the battle of Hogwarts and host Voldemort at her house. So I'm thinking when they say things like 'the aurors rounded up the death eaters' I think they're bundling the extras in with them who were probably easier and less skilled, since only the best get his 'stamp' of approval. In fact do they even say they rounded up death eaters or are they more general and say something like followers?

"e3ft9pu","I’m not sure I love the ending, but it didn’t do much to sour me on the film when I first saw it. I agree that it’s a near-perfect movie. (And I’ll admit there are some spots just after the delivery of the explosives that might have served as less shocking/campy conclusions.) 

Anyways, we can be reasonably sure that (a) Mario is totally insane by the end of the film, and so not in possession of the faculties which would prevent him for driving recklessly; and, continuing along these lines, (b) he has delusions of invincibility after completing so dangerous and suicidal a mission.

 Because of these factors, Mario fails to recognize that the cruel but indifferent desert he just traveled through is dangerous whether he’s carrying explosives or not. And as part of his delusional self-confidence, he becomes very happy to have escaped (he thinks) from said desert with his life—but he’s not out of it yet. The roads remain treacherous, the cliffs remain high, and so on. Not seeing this, and clearly not thinking logically, he remains in a state of elation, driving like a maniac when he’s still in the thick of it. The waltz—which may or may not be a vision of Mario’s—seems to represent what Mario thinks he’s already attained, and so he drives in rhythm with the sway of the music. But of course he hasn’t attained a thing. His foresight and hindsight are both out of order—he fails to recognize that what might come (the dance with Linda) hasn’t actually come yet, and likewise fails to remember that what has just happened to him (the deaths of three men) really ought to keep him on his toes.

 In other words: he’s temporarily lost his ability to feel fear, which normally works in tandem with reason to prevent human beings from taking suicidal risks. (Of course, this is all a result of the hellishly fearful mission he’s just undergone, which mission affords viewers a front row seat to Mario’s mental deterioration.) The wages of fear aren’t payed out when he delivers the explosives; they’re paid out when he drives off the cliff. The echo of that biblical line (“The wages of sin is death”) is no small one. But in Mario’s case, because he perishes *after* having lost his faculty of fear, you could equally say that the wages of fearlessness is death. And so it is for him.",1533160100,"because of these factors, mario fails to recognize that the cruel but indifferent desert he just traveled through is dangerous whether he’s carrying explosives or not.","cruel but indifferent","cruel","but",FALSE,"cruel but indifferent","indifferent",NA,NA,1

"e2tl6zn","The humans were like children to us. They were new to the galaxy. Their ships were small. They used mere toys to travel, rockets and nuclear fusion. They actually kept their entire ships filled with a portion of their atmosphere, instead of each individual carrying its own necessary environment. No sentient race would willingly take to the vast open black between stars with such ancient technology. It was ridiculous. And like children, they had their own made up rules that they expected each other to follow. Peculiarly, they even had rules saying outright that they were not to do certain things, such as torture, or commit genocide, or deploy nuclear, chemical, or biologic agents to kill. How strange that such a child- like race would even consider such horrors. Such acts were like bogeymen under a child's bed, no intelligent species could even consider such hellish ideas. We actually have records of a species being studied from a distance many generations ago. They were aggressive, brutish, and stupid. Once their scientists developed nuclear weapons they actually used them on themselves. Naturally their planet slowly turned into a lifeless shell. The very fact that these humans had survived past the scientific age of their species proved that they were the same as us. 

Or so we thought.

The struggle for natural resources does not end once a species begins to explore the galaxy. It just gets larger. We never intended to wander so far from the center of the galaxy, but our sensors indicated a world rich in resources, which we needed. When we arrived, we found said humans sitting around on vast amounts of water on the surface and molten metal deep in the mantle of their planet. They were such arrogant little children, persistent in the belief that simply because they stood on it, they owned it. Children cannot own things, they merely have what they are given by their elders, and so we explained that while we were taking the majority of resources from their planet, it would still have a breathable atmosphere. They should be thankful for our consideration. While not entirely unexpected, they rebelled against us. Like children, they flung projectiles at us, everything from tiny casings of metal at high speeds to large rockets with explosives packed into the nose. We may be their elders, and we may possess far greater technology, but no technology can withstand such abuse forever. We became angry. We decided we needed to respond, to punish these children and bring them into line. We made a terrible mistake. 

We could have chosen different places to begin our mining. It wouldn't make a noticeable difference, in the end, the plasma beams pierce through anything, being designed to melt down miles of planetary crust. Yet we chose, in anger, to begin drilling in population centers. Since many millions of humans would die of starvation and geological upheaval after our extraction was complete anyway, we saw it as perhaps a mercy to them. They were meant to understand that we were beyond questioning, beyond reproach from them. As we positioned our plasma carvers in the upper atmosphere above a selection of larger human cities, over one billion of the creatures were incinerated in moments. What species could withstand such a loss? It was cruel, but necessary, we thought. They would retreat, lick their wounds, and cower beneath us until we left, watching us from afar, rightly terrified of further retribution. Humanity went silent, aghast at the loss of life, and once we were satisfied they would stay that way, turned our collective backs on them to focus on our task. 

As we dug into the planet and began storing what we could of their vast oceans, we began to learn small bits about what culture the humans had. It was during these few days that we learned of the supposed rules they had for war. How very like children it would be to make a game out of war. On the other hand, the rules dealt with horrors unfit for any sentient species. Merely reading about them caused anxiousness in our ranks. In retrospect, it should have caused much more than passing concern. We did not know it at the time, but we had broken the rules. Humanity was no longer at war. It was out to survive, at any cost.

The first salvo of missiles came from everywhere at once. They came from atmosphere- bound flying machines, from the mountainsides, even from the depths of the oceans. We strengthened our defenses, our sensors screaming alarms for the several minutes the rockets were in flight. We did not think further resistance was possible after our previous show of dominance. How could this species still have the will to fight? Our shields glimmered at the edges of our hovering ships, awaiting the impact of explosives. The explosions we expected never came. Tiny suns flashed into being near our vessels the world over, magnitudes more powerful than any explosive the humans had flung at us before. Our shields were able to withstand the sudden impact, but the immense heat began to melt the armor underneath. In disbelief we stared at the screens warning us of levels of radiation far greater than any creature could withstand. In the atmosphere of a planet, we were protected from solar radiation, and had no reason to leave our solar shields on. We quickly activated them to prevent further contamination, but the damage had been done. The very environment suits we wore were already emitting deadly levels of radiation. The mining vessels now contained vast amounts of radioactive water and metal. In stunned silence we attempted to understand what had just been done. The humans had used nuclear weapons on their own planet. What kind of monsters would use nuclear weapons on their own planet? Dumbfounded, we thought we had seen the worst humanity had to offer. We were so very, very wrong. 

We needed to evacuate our contaminated ships. If we could survive long enough, we could decontaminate our environment suits, and possibly later, even our ships. Through fallout obstructing nearly every range of electromagnetic communications, we managed to organize a few meeting points across the planet. The humans followed us. As we tried to evacuate, explosives rained from the sky, releasing not just shrapnel, but poisons that floated in the air, clinging to and burning away both suit and flesh alike. As we scattered, terrified of horrors that no sentient species had experienced in living memory, the humans hunted us down. Those of us who surrendered were imprisoned, beaten, tortured for information, and used for experiments. The humans seek information about the galaxy, and pathogens in our bodies that they can modify to make more virulent and deadly. 

The humans now study our ships and technology. Most of us are dead, through the slow, painful effects of radiation poisoning. The humans will not heal us. They are no longer children, bound by rules of a war they have turned into a game. They are monsters. They combine the intelligence of a sentient race with the capacity for atrocities unknown to the spacefaring species of the galaxy. They made rules for themselves, rules for what they cannot do in war, and we forced them to break those rules. Now they are coming for the rest of the galaxy.

&gt; Their discussions of freedom and democracy were always in the context of freedom for white, straight, cis-male property owners.

Agreed, we appropriated their words for everyone else over time. Founding fathers expected all white males to own property over time.

&gt; The overwhelming consensus supported the ethnic cleansing of the indigenous people they were stealing land from as well as brutal slavery, the enslavement of women to their husbands, the torture and murder of non-straight non-cis people.

“Ethnic cleansing” was by far the minority opinion. Most wanted to kick natives out and move them somewhere else, and then white people became too numerous and choked natives out wherever they were relocated to. Dishonest and cruel, but it was absolutely not any sense of systematic ethnic cleansing.

Women’s rights were revolutionary during the Revolutionary period in America for the time. Women were seen and expected to be as independent people, despite common preferences for the man to be head of the household. America actually degenerated in this front during the 1800’s.

I agree with the slavery and homophobia.

Fair enough but its still not ok to say.

&gt;Also this is a very emotional topic for me because of my experiences with my own mother and my situation when I was younger and it just sickens me that a majority of modern women in my mothers situation would literally take me out of their womb and crush my skull and suck out my brain before I even got to live. It's just horrifying and cruel

When I was overweight I used to read fatpeoplehate now &amp; then. I HATED that sub - it was so vicious and nasty! - yet was drawn to read it. At the time I thought it was because I wanted to steel myself against the horrible people of the world, like going to the zoo to see the snakes. But after a few months I realized I was reading because *I was secretly wondering if they were right* about some things. Was it true that fatness was unhealthy, that the same person thinner vs fatter would almost always be healthier if they were thinner? Could it possibly be true that weight loss *was* possible for most if not all people, that it was primarily a matter of finding the right approach? Had I really tried *everything*... or had I just half-assed tried the easiest things only, and written off the other options as “too difficult”?

"e0b1bhf","&gt;We can expedite the refugee process by making anyone charged with a crime in Canada (e.g. crossing the border illegally) ineligible for refugee status, landed immigrant status, or aid of any kind.

This would go against our international treaty commitments.

&gt;We can expedite the removal of illegal border crossers by arranging to send them home immediately - and publicizing it. **It's cruel,** but we need to make an example of people so that border crossers know we're serious.

Allow me to point out section 12 of the charter: ""12. Everyone has the right not to be subjected to any cruel and unusual treatment or punishment.""

&gt;We can install temporary fences at the most popular and accessible border crossings and warn people of the consequences of entering the country illegally at other locations - turn them back in other words. We can mobilize our military to help.

This is virtue signalling, nothing more. The proposal you make would cost more than it would save taxpayers.

&gt;We can loudly proclaim an international crisis and demand the UN get involved in helping to process - Trudeau, who is partly responsible, needs to do this.

The UN is busy dealing with the actual crises, you know, the ones in places that aren't receiving a few tens of thousands of immigrants, but millions.

&gt;We can work with the US to figure out what to do with refugee claimants from the US. This is a boon for them, and we're paying the price.

They will ignore us as long as Trump is in charge, and as soon as he isn't the problem largely solves itself.

&gt;We can place a moratorium on our immigration quotas to make space for refugees that do qualify, and make sure as many as working as possible by also coordinating with our TFW program

This makes no sense. At all. Unless your plan is to stoke anger among other immigrant populations to score political points. A refugee working in a TFW program is also ridiculous.

Right now there's a precedent that parents can stay with their Canadian-born children because A) the child has a right to be here and B) it's cruel to separate that child from their parents.

"e09cdxr","&gt;And for me personally, I am a very reserved vegetarian. I certainly don't go around calling people names for eating meat. 

Trust me, if this country had more reasonable people like you it would be in a far better state than it is now.

&gt;However imagine if you truly thought that animals were conscious, sentient creatures that had ""souls"". Wouldn't you kind of be an asshole to not fight vigorously for them? to not be outraged? 

I view it in the same way I view a relationship between any predator and prey. A tiger hunts down another animal which is just as living as the tiger is (and if you believe in animal sentience and the possession of souls, then that animal was equally sentient and had a similar soul), but its not against the natural order of the world. I'm not going to try and interfere because it's understood that the tiger has its own needs to survive.

In the case of human beings it's, of course, more complex. We're omnivores. We can sustain ourselves without meat unlike a carnivore. However, it's not wrong for one to consume another living organism because you're naturally endowed with the ability to do so. If you can do it and you like it, and it serves a purpose (i.e. not just for the intent of wanton slaughter) by both nourishing and pleasing you, I don't see anything wrong with it. Hence why I partake in it without reservation. It's sad and maybe cruel, but it's not evil or bad in my view.

&gt;In the US, the abortion issue is very polarized. Frankly I don't know where I stand. But if the religious people genuinely believe that there is a soul and basically a human being in that early-stage zygote.. shouldn't they be passionate and even angry that millions of them are killed every year by an otherwise civilized nation? 

I mean, abortion is a polarising issue everywhere. Even I'm not really clear where I stand, but I understand the arguments for it. If the child is an unwanted one, then I doubt he/she will get to enjoy a very joyous life should they be born. Then there's situations where there's a threat to another life i.e. the life of  the mother. IIRC there was an Indian woman in Ireland who wanted to undergo an MTP because miscarriage due to complications was clearly inevitable (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Savita_Halappanavar). The hospital denied her request and refused to allow for an abortion because they failed to diagnose the issue properly (and by the time they did detect it, the miscarriage was complete) and Ireland's laws used to prohibit abortion unless there was determined to be great risk to the life of the mother. When they finally did decide to do something, they attempted to induce delivery but failed and she died of sepsis due to the miscarriage. It caused massive outrage internationally, and Ireland ended up passing the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protection_of_Life_During_Pregnancy_Act_2013) which still came under fire for a number of reasons.

That is one of the greatest examples of an avoidable death that arose because a few were too religious to allow it. In trying to not do something because it was apparently an act of evil, they ended up committing a greater evil. Its why I am okay with abortion under such scenarios, but of course I can't really say for sure what my view of the procedure is when it comes to non-life risking, voluntary abortion is.

"dzob8fz","&gt;&gt;Random mutations are usually deleterious.

&gt;Citation needed.

Sorry, I just realized, I miswrote that--I meant to only include the subset of mutations that have some kind of effect and aren't basically neutral.

&gt;What if we already are having 8 children, of which 6 don't reproduce because they were never born?

Well, we would have to determine what fraction of mutations kill in utero (or at the sperm stage) and divide that out of the overall deleterious mutation rate... although these are still problematic since they reduce fertility, which isn't incorporated in my model.  You have to drop the deleterious mutation rate pretty far before 3 child families are viable. I think these are already excluded from most estimates of the deleterious mutation rate...

&gt;I've done extensive research, trying to figure out what a reasonable estimate is, and no one has any idea.

Yeah... It's hard to find out exactly what it is but we can get a good broad range. But just based on observing animal behavior, it doesn't seem like a k-type reproductive strategy to the extent that humans practice it is viable. 

I realize that nature is pretty bloody and cruel, but there ought to have been SOME higher animal somewhere that figured out how to be K-Type to the extent where 3 offspring is even remotely preferred. Instead, I can't find any.

"dyi0ers","(Heart stopped) Saw loved ones. Was taken out and above the earth. Time ceased to exist. Everything felt totally NOW...like my awareness was expanded in every direction.  Perception of time and space became simplistic and understood perfectly. Total joy. Total Love. Perfect comprehension of this ""life"" experience. Was shown I had done it many times before both on this world and others. Was shown I had the choice before birth...to do it again...chose to in order to help us all grow. Was shown that we are all connected. Your growth is my growth ... both direction. No ""one"" is better than the other. We are all seen as the same...only taking different classes and in different ""grades"" and knowledge... Different yes... but NO one is seen as less. Could understand, with perfect clarity, those who are heartless and cruel by accessing their ""lives"" that had brought them to that point. Then I saw that many past lives ago...I too was heartless and cruel..but had worked through it by trying again and again ..through many lives. 

No pain. No sadness. Euphoria beyond anything we can experience here. Best example: A sexual orgasm only multiply it by 100 million and it never ends. It was perfect Love that I was experiencing down to the ""atomic"" level of every part of my Soul. Literally...could perceive the smallest part of every atom...within...in this state of vibrational Love....like my Soul had gone super Nova. 

Returning to this world has been difficult. The contrast is so extreme. I am thinking about it every day and long to go back. I use the ""energy imprint"" to gauge what is authentic and real in this world...and what is pure ego. At the same time...I use what I know...to help enlighten where I can. I can tell the moments when someone is ready. Usually big events... death...or chronic pain...or they ask me. 

I saw we come here to learn these main lessons: Authentic Love, Patients, Compassion, and EMPATHY. (The Golden Rule) Most get compassion. Few get empathy and seeing it from ""the other's"" true internal perspective. It's a tough one to learn. Coming back my empathy chip has been enhanced 1000 percent....I sponge up other people's emotions ...good or bad...to the point of exhaustion. It IS good ...as I get what the other is feeling and can sense need...and know what I can do to help. (The first thing you do when leaving the body is life review...from the perspective of other people/animals you interacted with in life. If you showed love...you feel it...if cruelty...you feel that. It's the perfect teacher when a life ends) 

I was shown the chapters of my life going forward...right up to the day of my final passing. (I will be very old)  So far each one has happened. 

PS different than a dream as you can see your body...from outside of it. Also...the information makes clear sense...everything makes perfect sense...so much so it registers not only in your consciousness but right down to the ""sub-atomic"" level of your being. Dreams...don't do this.   Also the Love, experienced,  is beyond anything in life or a dream. Dreams... are usually all over the place and hazy.

"dyhotjm","I think there are two angles that this question comes from, that of the action and that of the victim. 

So like, the action one is “if A can do B, then I can also do B”; the victim one is “if B can happen to C, then I can also do B to C”. I hope this makes sense. 

The first thought process would be “animals hurt animals, why can’t we do what animals do?” I think this one is pretty easily dismissed without too much thought. We restrict our behavior in countless ways that don’t apply to animals - we don’t rape, we don’t kill or ostracize our weak, we don’t poop wherever we want, etc. We clearly understand that there is a difference between our behavior and animal behavior, so using what animals do as justification for the harm we cause falls apart pretty instantly. 

The second angle is one I think people mean more often, though it’s the former that’s most often addressed. This thought process goes “animals are killed and eaten by other animals, therefore it’s ok for animals to be killed and eaten by us.” This perspective purports that humans can do to others that would/could happen “naturally” to said others. I hope I’m phrasing this well, but essentially from this view it’s the victim that is held consistent, so if it’s ok for this being to *ever* be the victim, then it’s ok for this being to *always* be the victim. This still doesn’t hold true for all scenarios, though, making it a fallacious argument. It’s “ok” when a toddler hits another toddler (sure it would be better if the toddler hadn’t done that, but it’s certainly not a crime nor is it an indicator of character or morals), but it would not be at all ok for an adult to hit the same toddler. Or you could consider something like boxing, where it is truly ok for one person to attack another but outside of the ring it would never be ok to attack either of them. In our hyper-romantization of predators, we forget that a) prey often gets away b) prey can and does fight back and sometimes wins and c) all animals will one day end up as a meal for another animal. Humans have created a completely unfair playing field, one where there are no prey survivors and there are no predator risks. Natural is cruel but fair. Humans are just cruel. 

In the first situation, the determining factor is moral agency; in the second, it’s power dynamics.

"dxvgj62","&gt; When Willow performed the ceremony, Xander was supposed to tell Buffy what Willow was doing, but instead he told her Willow says kick his ass. She could have stalled the battle till he could get his soul back or even trick him into using his blood to reclose Acathla, something other than going in with the intention to kill him.

I'll argue this one.

Given the stakes - Acathla sucking the world into Hell - should they have held back on the off-chance that Willow *might* have succeeded? Even Willow didn't really expect her efforts to work.

Buffy was already deeply emotionally compromised. She was also their only chance at stopping Angelus: it's not like Xander or anyone else could fight him. If Xander tells her what's going on, and she consequently decides, ""I can't do this, I can't kill him, not when there's a chance Angel can be saved,"" then how does it play out? She tries to stall, never has her epiphany moment of self-reliance, fights for a few minutes longer until she's exhausted, loses, and then... end of the world.

Xander's action was deceptive and arguably cruel, but it was utilitarian, and made it easier for Buffy to do what needed to be done.

The whole situation is interesting because nobody was completely rational. Everyone had some vested interest skewing their perspective. Buffy and her love for Angel. Willow and her desire to support her best friend, and faith in her ability to accomplish impossible things through her intellect. Xander's inferiority, detachment, and jealousy due to his unresolved romantic desire for Buffy. Giles' heartbreak, vengeance, and trauma.

I think Xander's perspective was the one that ended up aligning most closely with objectivity. If you take that step back and strip away any emotional connection, it's clear that Angelus needs to be stopped. It's sad that Angel will die in the process, but at the end of the day, it's a sacrifice, his life doesn't outweigh the entire world, and really he was already lost when Angelus emerged.",1524552934,"xander's action was deceptive and arguably cruel, but it was utilitarian, and made it easier for buffy to do what needed to be done.","cruel, but it","cruel","but",TRUE,"deceptive and arguably cruel","deceptive","arguably",NA,0

"dxa5z00","I think this conservative critique is on to some thing. So in the 60s and 70s until early 90s you have a rise of crime, a rise of single parenthood and also rise of divorces.

This is a time under the influence of sexual revolution, rise of the drug trade, the civil rights movement, Vietnam War.

Something broke during that time.

Single parenthood tends to be associated with worse performance and higher criminality. And it rose very highly for black people. Although there had been a general rise among the white demographic too, and also very rise rise in divorces, which supports the narrative that the American sexual revolution went more wrong than other adoptees.

Thomas Sowell blames the welfare state. I am not sure I agree, but I think his thinking is interesting, but you can't neglect the influence of sexual revolution as well. Perhaps sexual libertine social mores are harmful in contrast to more sexually moderate social norms, and for disadvantaged working class communities, perhaps even more conservative norms. Somehow other countries managed to adopt to modernity and sexual revolution, without some of the radicalism and extremism and bad consequences in the USA, including the higher divorce rate there, and got a more moderate sexual revolution. Maybe adaptation is easier, and allows you to more carefully select the good and discard the excesses.



The city hall outlet published [this](https://www.city-journal.org/html/culture-circumstance-and-agency-14700.html) great article on Hillbilly Elegy book touching on both black and white underclass and how they had been affected detrimentally by certain cultural and economic changes. The gist of it is that the cultural changes, removed from working class people certain means of self control, such as stigmas around casual sex, resulting in rising social problems.

&gt;Other answers require facing up to unpleasant truths. For the Right, that means acknowledging that the economy has changed in ways that have badly disadvantaged the working class, offering lower pay and less job security than the solid base of union manufacturing jobs that previously anchored these communities. “Creative destruction” is not so great when you’re on the receiving end of the destruction, and when it’s human lives rather than widgets or corporate profits at stake. The scope of this displacement has been far larger than originally anticipated, with the prospect of more to come, thanks to rapidly advancing technology. Trade deals and tax cuts won’t fix the problem.

&gt;For the Left, the unpleasant truth is what Vance makes clear if not explicit: the sexual revolution has been a disaster for the working class. No-fault divorce and the diminishment of the stigmas attached to casual sex and single or divorced motherhood have been a liberating dream—or at least a manageable reality—for educated urbanites. But these changes have been a nightmare for the children growing up in a white working-class world, where broken homes and a string of romantic and sexual partners for Mom is the new normal. “Of all the things that I hated about my childhood,” Vance writes, “nothing compared to the revolving door of father figures.”

&gt;My own childhood was an early harbinger of bad things to come. I was a child of the first generation of no-fault divorce. But both sets of my grandparents were in lifelong marriages, and my community was mostly shaped by a culture of intact homes. My mother’s Pentecostal faith—similar to that of Vance’s father—shaped her conservative behavior with men after her divorce; I was spared the revolving door of boyfriends that Vance had to endure. Without these advantages, who knows where I would have wound up?

&gt;Today, after 40 more years of broken marriages and out-of-wedlock births, far fewer people in my hometown come from intact families. I now see grandmothers, even great-grandmothers, sometimes single and, like Vance’s Mamaw, belatedly trying to make up for major life problems they themselves only recently emerged from, raising children of drug-addicted mothers. There remain some successful, intact families back home, but this new reality exerts a powerful influence on the local culture.

&gt;Vance overcame his domestic instability. Many others don’t. Harvard economist Raj Chetty found that when it comes to explaining the variance in upward social mobility across so-called commuting zones, “the strongest and most robust predictor is the fraction of children with single parents.” That observation is likely to prove about as popular among liberals as the Moynihan Report.


&gt;By Vance’s own account, the confidence, discipline, and work ethic he acquired in the Marine Corps enabled him to overcome a difficult background. But the Marines don’t instill order into the disordered lives of recruits by inspiration or encouragement; they impose it by force. Historically, de facto legal and social controls limited personally and socially destructive choices in many working-class communities (if not Appalachian ones). These norms were undoubtedly repressive and often cruel, but so are drill sergeants. The elimination of these norms—at the behest of the educated, not working, classes—has corrosively undermined the supports that once sustained functional working class communities, particularly when combined with the rise in college attendance that has sucked out the most talented, like Vance, and routed them to metro or neighborhood enclaves of the similarly successful. (Vance currently lives in San Francisco.)  

&gt;The major form of social control that we have retained with full vigor is the criminal justice system. So today, problems previously handled through other means now fall into the lap of police and judges, with predictable challenges. We have continued to use traditional social-control mechanisms for some purposes: promulgating gay rights, reducing the use of the Confederate flag, and so on. Until we’re willing to re-embrace similar means to restore a semblance of family stability in poor and working-class communities—white or otherwise—too many children will never stand a chance.

So yeah, sexually libertine norms can be quite destructive vs more moderate and careful sexual mores and behavior. More two parent families would probably improve outcomes. This won't necessary result in income parity among different groups, but it could lead to more children growing under stable households with mother and father. This would help keep some people out of prison, and have a better life. Of course how you effectively change culture mores is another difficult relevant question to all of this.

"dxa2yl9","Your explanation for Jesus makes perfect sense except for a couple of things. 

For one, most fundamentalists insist that God is all powerful and all knowing, but if that was the case that wouldn't be necessary, and neither would all of the suffering in the world, thus God would have to be immensely cruel. However if you drop the idea that they're all powerful and all knowing, then this would make sense as they would need to see first hand what being human and mortal is like to really understand and empathize with us. 

And second, why did it take him so long to do this? Hundreds of thousands of years have gone by that humans existed, having civilization starting in the past ten thousand years. They wait until six thousand ish years ago (whenever Jewish monothiesm started) before they even appear to humanity, and another four thousand years before they think maybe they should try to get to know humans better.

It kind of makes me think of the common depictions of fairies in folklore and medieval fantasy settings. Whimsical, lovely little immortal beings that have no concept of mortality, time, or pain in general so when they're wronged they always blow things way out of proportion with a terribly cruel curse of some kind. Not because they're cruel, but because they just don't understand just how bad that is for a mortal.

As for the whole eternal damnation stuff, don't even get me started on that again. That's just cruel and downright evil in itself no matter how you slice it.

I've heard about one belief from some Catholics that actually made some sense to me that's worth mentioning. They believed in a purgatory as an inbetween place not just for people who were just strayed off course a little, but any and every one that wasn't downright evil or bad in some way. Essentially the closer you are to God the easier it is for your spirit to go straight to heaven. Otherwise you're just kind of lost when you die until eventually your spirit finds its way. That's the point of ""All Souls Day"" for Catholics, it's to help guide the lost spirits through prayer. Sure makes a lot more sense both morally and logically than damnation. In fact it's not even a punishment of any kind, it's just saying as a natural consequence of your spiritual seperation from God it's just going to take longer for you to find your way into heaven after death.

"dx9uy1l","&gt;Sacking King's Landing gives his men and vassals lots of loot and increases their loyalty to him and their trust in his leadership. He sends the Mountain and Ser Lorch to kill the princess and her children. That thery are stupid brutes and do what they do is just an acceptable side-effect.

And in doing so, he alienates the people of KL, the Martells and any Targ loyalists. 

&gt;He smiles about the Red Wedding because it removes a potent enemy from the board.

The way Tyrion describes Tywin's smile, it's more like a sadistic smile.

&gt;Yeah, that is very cruel, but does send a very strong message - no fraternising with the smallfolk in the Lannister family.

He could've sent the same message without having someone raped 100 times and forcing his son to do it.

&gt;He loots, pillages and rapes the Riverlands to keep the Riverlords from uniting against him or effectively gathering a strong force or supplying it.

Indeed, but he's also going to have to realize that he's going to be ruling over the Riverlands and Winter is almost there. It's pretty vindictive to destroy one of the breadbaskets of the continent.

&gt;Tywin is ruthless and cruel and utterly without remorse, but murdering, looting, pillaging and raping are acceptable means to his end, not something he finds satisfying in itself.

Then why did Tywin have Elia raped? 

The Meereense Blot dude will say it better than me: 

Conclusion: The Truth About Tywin

&gt;Since Tyrion’s embrace of Tywin seems pivotal for the future of the series, it’s worth clarifying one point about who Tywin Lannister truly is. Tywin presents the image that he uses brutal methods purely because of his pragmatism, but there are reasons to doubt this. Here he presents the murder of Rhaegar’s children as necessary:

&gt;&gt;“Far be it from me to question your cunning, Father, but in your place I do believe I’d have let Robert Baratheon bloody his own hands.”

&gt;&gt;Lord Tywin stared at him as if he had lost his wits. “You deserve that motley, then. We had come late to Robert’s cause. It was necessary to demonstrate our loyalty.  When I laid those bodies before the throne, no man could doubt that we had forsaken House Targaryen forever.” (ASOS TYRION VI)

&gt;And he passes off the rape and murder of Elia Martell as a regrettable bit of excess that he had nothing to do with:

&gt;&gt;His father shrugged. “I grant you, it was done too brutally. Elia need not have been harmed at all, that was sheer folly. By herself she was nothing.”

&gt;&gt;“Then why did the Mountain kill her?”

&gt;&gt;“Because I did not tell him to spare her. I doubt I mentioned her at all. I had more pressing concerns. Ned Stark’s van was rushing south from the Trident, and I feared it might come to swords between us. And it was in Aerys to murder Jaime, with no more cause than spite. That was the thing I feared most. That, and what Jaime himself might do.” He closed a fist. “Nor did I yet grasp what I had in Gregor Clegane, only that he was huge and terrible in battle. The rape . . . even you will not accuse me of giving that command, I would hope.”

&gt;&gt;Ser Amory was almost as bestial with Rhaenys…” … His mouth twisted in distaste. “The blood was in him.”

&gt;&gt;But not in you, Father. There is no blood in Tywin Lannister. (ASOS TYRION VI)

&gt;This is the image Tywin seeks to project — hard as stone, pragmatic, ruthless, and not driven by any base desires like bloodlust. But late in ASOS, Martin decides to undercut Tywin’s self-made myth. With the late revelation of Shae in Tywin’s bed, we learn that Tywin absolutely is driven by lust. (It is a ludicrous and hypocritical risk for Tywin to sleep with Shae, who is now known by the entire court as the Imp’s Whore. If such a salacious tale got out, it would immediately ruin the image Tywin has spent decades constructing for himself.) His public image of complete self-discipline was, simply, bullshit, as symbolically emphasized twice by Martin:

&gt;&gt;“But the stink that filled the privy gave ample evidence that the oft-repeated jape about his father was ""just another lie"".Lord Tywin Lannister did not, in the end, shit gold. (ASOS TYRION XI)

&gt;&gt;The Lord of Casterly Rock made such an impressive figure that it was a shock when his destrier dropped a load of dung right at the base of the throne. (ACOK SANSA VIII)

&gt;Oberyn suggests that Tywin’s claim to have had no part in Elia’s fate is bullshit as well:

&gt;&gt;“I told you of the welcome we found at Casterly Rock. What I did not tell you was that my mother waited as long as was decent, and then broached your father about our purpose. Years later, on her deathbed, she told me that Lord Tywin had refused us brusquely. His daughter was meant for Prince Rhaegar, he informed her. And when she asked for Jaime, to espouse Elia, he offered her you instead.”

&gt;&gt;“Which offer she took for an outrage.”

&gt;&gt;“It was. Even you can see that, surely?”

&gt;&gt;“Oh, surely.” It all goes back and back, Tyrion thought, to our mothers and fathers and theirs before them. We are puppets dancing on the strings of those who came before us, and one day our own children will take up our strings and dance on in our steads. “Well, Prince Rhaegar married Elia of Dorne, not Cersei Lannister of Casterly Rock. So it would seem your mother won that tilt.”

&gt;&gt;“She thought so,” Prince Oberyn agreed, “but your father is not a man to forget such slights. He taught that lesson to Lord and Lady Tarbeck once, and to the Reynes of Castamere. And at King’s Landing, he taught it to my sister.” (ASOS TYRION X)

&gt;Oberyn believes Tywin deliberately ordered the rape and murder of Elia out of vengeance because she, not Cersei, won Rhaegar’s hand. The dramatic placement of this revelation, late in ASOS, leads me to believe he is absolutely right, and that Tywin was lying through his teeth to Tyrion when he denied any part in it. “The blood was in” Tywin Lannister, very much so. And this desire for vengeance drove him past pragmatism — and toward needless cruelty and brutality. As Tyrion attempts to get his vengeance in future books, he will have to grapple with the question of whether Tywin’s legacy is truly one he should embrace.

"dwzjw7e","Conflict Is Not Black And White. Everyone Loses Something In War.

I love that. But now for your questions.


1. In my opinion you could go really in depth about Eren here. How he grew up thinking the world is black and white , titans bad and humans good.  Later down the line his views are dramatically changed when he finds out about Marley and unlocks the memories of Grisha and the Owl. It crushes his views about the world , basically making him a emotionless and machiavellist type of person. He will fulfill his goals no matter the cost. He thinks that by destroying Marley and taking their titans he is doing a good thing. And of course you as the reader can relate to Eren , because you've been with him through his journey. What happens to the Marleyan warrior cadets really shows the horrors of war.

Reiner - Reiner starts with a similar world view as Eren . Mainland titans good , Paradis titans bad. But once he becomes a solider on Paradis , he starts to feel remorse for what he is doing. People from Paradis are not devils , they're just normal people who are trying to survive. Even though Reiner currently wants to die , i believe that after he learns that so many people have died from the Paradis assault he is going to become the same as Eren. 


Willy - Oh boy , this guy is mastermind. He played the victim card , and let the whole world know that Paradisans are evil and should be killed. He is doing this to secure freedom for Marley , and to ensure that Marley stays a global force. 

2) I don’t have time to worry if it’s right or wrong, you can’t hope for a horror story with a happy ending! 


It's not like we're not prepared to die, but what the hell are we dying for?


Conflict between people will become impossible, only when mankind is reduced to one person or less


3) 1) They are using armbands to discriminate people


2) It is prohibited for Eldians and Marleyans to marry each other, because it would pollute the Marleyan blood. ( I'm not 100 % sure about this but in our world i think the Nazi's named this Rasenshande or something like that) 


3) They build ghettos to house the Eldians and separe them from Marleyans. ( Very similar to contraction camps)

4) Marleyans make propaganda about Eldians.

5) They are discriminated everywhere , because Marley is the world leader. ( If Nazi Germany won , it would be the same for the jews )

6) They have really bad punishments for people who disobey Marley.  



4) That you can never takes a persons freedom away from them. Freedom always finds a way

"dwz8ni4","It is common for young victims to forget about the assault until they are older. It doesn’t matter how long ago it happened. Someone robbed you of your innocence when you were just a child. This is not just any kind of assault, what this man did to you is lawfully considered rape. Unwanted vaginal penetration of any kind including fingering is categorized as rape according to the law. This is a very serious matter and should be handled as such. It is completely normal for you to be unsure of  how to approach this situation. Confusion strikes most all of us when it comes to understanding child abuse. It just shouldn’t happen. I wish I could close my eyes and pretend that the world is not so cold and cruel, but I am also a victim of sexual assault and also suffer from PTSD and Major Depression. 

Fortunately, you do have options though. First, I would get in to see a therapist at least once a week ASAP. Not only do metal health professionals have the answers to the questions you are asking on this post right now, they will also help you come up with a treatment plan that is right for your recovery. Believe it or not, you are not alone in this “silent war”. Far too many are suffering with you, but most don’t have the courage to seek help. Be brave and be open. Suppressing your memories may be the best option for you temporarily, but long term this method will only cause you further pain and complications. In treatment, you need to allow yourself to remember what has happened so that you can go through the stages of grief because this is a huge loss for you.

 Don’t try to face this alone. Friends, family, and your treatment team will make up your support system and your support system will play a major role in your recovery. Recovery starts with treatment. Treatment is by no means easy, but I guarantee you it is your best option for you right now. Mental health professionals will provide a safe environment for your treatment and will direct you on how to properly recover your memories when you are ready and will advise you on how to manage the pain that will come with them. Once you get a therapist, psychiatrist, or psychologist don’t settle for treatment that isn’t working for you. Different treatments work for different people and there will be some doctors that don’t meet your needs. Never settle for less. There are millions of therapists, groups, and treatments out there. And if your doctor isn’t working for you, change doctors as many times as it takes until you find the right fit.

Next, explore your legal options privately with a local attorney even if you do not plan on ever pressing charges or going to the police. Don’t worry about expenses. There are plenty of free attorney services available and the first session with an attorney is almost always free no matter how expensive they are. Attorneys are extremely knowledgeable about law enforcement and they will show you all of the legal options you will have if you choose to press charges. You do not have to decide if you want to press charges before meeting with the attorney. There is no harm in exploring your options early on. You can take as much time as you need even years before you make the decision to go to court, but I would meet with an attorney as soon as I started treatment because they will help you write a statement while the assault is fresh on your mind. A statement is the first thing you will need if you decide to confront the police and an attorney can write, review, and perfect your statement for you. At your mental health clinic it would be wise for you to request a social worker. Social workers are there to help patients in whatever way they can to point you in the right direction to finda reputable attorney and all of the information you share with them is 100 percent confidential. Social workers spend most of their time researching and gathering information for patients and I believe they would  find you an affordable or free attorney that specializes in sexual assault cases easily. An attorney will educate you on how the laws work specifically with your state and will provide you will valuable information that will prepare you for court if you decide to file a report with the police. Just because you ask an attorney for advice does not mean in any shape or form that you have to go through with filing a report with the police. Attorneys are strictly bound by law to keep everything you tell them confidential. Even if you do not plan on ever going to the police about the assault, there would be no harm in gaining knowledge about your legal options and the state laws and regulations for sexual assault in a minor. and the best part about consulting with an attorney is you are the boss. Everything you tell your attorney is completely confidential. I personally don’t advise going to the police before an attorney because unlike an attorney, the police legally are forced to perform an investigation the moment you file a report with them. With the police there is no going back or changing your mind about pressing charges once you say the words “sexual assault on a minor.”

The last piece of advice I have to give you is about closure. There is nothing that will help you more in your recovery than finding closure. Going to the police and filing a report (if or when you are ready) is personally what I have come to find the most helpful in finding closure for me. If I were you I would focus on my treatment and well being first and foremost. While in treatment, I would take my time exploring my legal options for the future with my attorney. Last, I would carefully take my time to decide wether filing a report with the police would be best for me. In the end this will be your decision and don’t let anybody tell you otherwise. I too had to face making that tough decision. The main reason I chose to go to the police after I was raped was to prevent the man who assaulted me from hurting anyone else. My biggest fear is that the man who did this to you has assaulted and/or is still assaulting children just like he did you. No matter the outcome of the trial, the accusation of him being a pedophile would follow him if he were to ever get in trouble again. Oh, and if he has been accused of sexual assault by another child before, that can and will be used against him as evidence in trial. This man needs to be locked up so that he can never set eyes on or lay his hand on a child ever again. But there is one thing more important than putting this man behind bars, and that is focusing on your recovery. Take as much time as you need to decide on filing a report and if you don’t want to do it or don’t think you can handle taking this man to court you don’t have to ever. Don’t let anyone pressure you into moving forward with the case if you aren’t ready. Everyone handles PTSD and sexual assault differently and your main focus should be on doing what is best for you mentally. Message me any time. I’ve been through this before and have experience in what you are going through and would like to be there in any way I can.

When the ark of the covenant was being returned to its rightful place in Jerusalem from the possession of the Philistines, one of the oxen's carrying the ark stumbled and the ark was about to fall. So naturally Uzzah went to go save it from being tarnished by the dirt on the earth but the moment he came in contact with the ark he immediately died. 

The beauty of this story is that it puts a perspective on what humans think about themselves before God. Uzzah was only trying to prevent the ark being tarnished by the dirt of the earth, but who's to say that the dirt is going to tarnish the ark more than a sinful human touching it? The dirt is doing what God commanded it to do since the beginning of creation, it has not rebelled against God whilst humans are in continual rebellion against God. From birth, Israelites are told to never ever ever touch the ark unless you are a Levite or a priest.

"ducmq1l","I've done a lot of research on this topic, having responded to about a dozen infant deaths in my career...

Everything I have read and learned points that SIDS is a bullshit diagnosis of exclusion. Most differential diagnosis base their criteria on INCLUSION. For example, for a heart attack if you have elevated enzymes, positive 12 LEAD EKG (STEMI) and chest pain you are having an MI. You don't diagnose an MI if someone doesn't eat vegetibes, doesn't exercise and is old. nobody would accept that. Those are risk factors. Meaning, 'SIDS' doesn't actually explain what happened just that the ER physician or medical examiner doesn't have a great explanation for the cause of death. You can't **die** from SIDS. SIDS is a BS diagnosis that exists because the healthcare system is uncomfortable with dead infants. I know this sounds very harsh and cruel, but it's true.  

Some of the biggest risk factors for SIDS are cohorts with parents who smoke (worse if they smoke inside), recent traumatic behaviour in the house,  caretaker abuse of alcohol and/or drugs, single parenthood, and low income.  When I discovered this I was a bit turned off.

I just think it's important that new parents realize SIDS isn't some scary disease process or event that can just strike a child randomly. Sure, there are rare heart conditions or other things that could happen to any child. But, I just feel like this should be said.

Similarly, if a prison guard or a prosecutor were to say that they wished they could inflict cruel and unusual punishment upon a criminal, I would be critical. So, consistent with that (and not at all based in sexism as you have claimed), I am critical of a judge making the statement that they wish they could inflict cruel and unusual punishment upon a criminal.

"drvubfa","https://www.cbsnews.com/news/there-was-no-tiananmen-square-massacre/

People definitely died but the idea that tanks were just running over people without regard is bullshit as well. 

https://www.cbsnews.com/news/reliving-the-nightmare-in-tiananmen/

Note how none of the reports talk about Tanks running over masses of people? 

Everybody agrees that people died. Amnesty estimates what? 1,000-2,000? The UK government estimated 2,700-3,400. Most ground journalists and NGO's aim around 1,000-2,000. The Chinese government figures are of course bullshit.

I don't support the actions of the Chinese government but the above representation, that it was just because students had opinions, is bullshit. 

The occupation began on 15/4/89 and lasted until 4/6/89.

&gt; Starting on the night of April 17, three thousand PKU students marched from the campus towards Tiananmen Square, and soon nearly a thousand students from Tsinghua joined. Upon arrival, they soon joined forces with those already gathered at the Square

&gt; On the morning of April 18, students remained in the Square. Some gathered around the Monument to the People's Heroes singing patriotic songs and listening to impromptu speeches by student organizers, others gathered at the Great Hall. Meanwhile, a few thousand students gathered at Xinhua Gate, the entrance to Zhongnanhai, the seat of the party leadership, where they demanded dialogue with the leadership. Police restrained the students from entering the compound. Students then staged a sit-in.

&gt; Hu's state funeral took place on April 22. On the evening of April 21, some 100,000 students marched on Tiananmen Square, ignoring orders from Beijing municipal authorities that the Square was to be closed off for the funeral. 

&gt; On April 22, near dusk, serious rioting broke out in Changsha and Xi'an. In Xi'an, arson from rioters destroyed cars and houses, and looting occurred in shops near the city's Xihua Gate. In Changsha, 38 stores were ransacked by looters. Over 350 people were arrested in both cities. In Wuhan, university students organized protests against the provincial governmen

&gt; Organized by the Union, on April 27 some 50,000–100,000 students from all Beijing universities marched through the streets of the capital to Tiananmen Square, breaking through lines set up by police, and receiving widespread public support along the way, particularly from factory workers.

I can continue linking more things. The point of why I mention this is because it highlights that this was not a case of the government attacking with military as soon as students had an opinion. this was a long drawn out process and the student movement also had no formal leadership, leading to a situation where there were multiple factions that could not come to an agreement and conciliation was difficult.

&gt; At the same time, internal divisions intensified within the student movement itself. By late May, the students became increasingly disorganized with no clear leadership or unified course of action. Moreover, Tiananmen Square was overcrowded and facing serious hygiene problems. Hou Dejian suggested an open election of the student leadership to speak for the movement, but was met with opposition.[34] Meanwhile, Wang Dan moderated his position, ostensibly sensing the impending military action and consequences, and advocated for a temporary withdrawal from Tiananmen Square to re-group on campus, but this was opposed by 'hardliner' student factions who wanted to hold the Square. The increasing internal friction would lead to struggles for control of the loudspeakers in the middle of the square in a series of 'mini-coups': whoever controlled the loudspeakers was 'in charge' of the movement. Some students would wait at the train station to greet arrivals of students from other parts of the country in an attempt to enlist factional support.[87] Student groups began accusing each other of ulterior motives such as collusion with the government and trying to gain personal fame from the movement. Some students even tried to oust Chai Ling and Feng Congde from their leadership positions in an attempted kidnapping, an action Chai called a ""well-organized and pre-meditated plot.""[34]


This highlights how the protesters had no idea of how to direct the movements. 

The Chinese government is oppressive and cruel, but it is not stupid. It decided to use a military response because it saw no end to the protests otherwise. 

&gt; The movement, on the wane at the end of April, now regained significant momentum. By 17 May, as students from across the country poured into the capital to join the movement, protests of varying sizes were occurring in some 400 Chinese cities.

For China, this was a potential outburst of Civil war and dissolution of the state:

&gt; Deng warned that if Beijing was not pacified quickly, the country risked civil war and another Cultural Revolution; his views were echoed by the party elders

&gt; On 19 May, the PSC met with military leaders and party elders. Deng presided over the meeting and said that martial law was the only option. At the meeting Deng declared that he was 'mistaken' in choosing Hu Yaobang and Zhao Ziyang as his successors, and resolved to remove Zhao from his position as general secretary. Deng also vowed to deal resolutely with Zhao's supporters and begin propaganda work.

&gt; The Chinese government declared martial law on 20 May, and mobilized at least 30 divisions from five of the country's seven military regions.[83] At least 14 of PLA's 24 army corps contributed troops.[83] As many as 250,000 troops were eventually sent to the capital, some arriving by air and others by rail.[84] Guangzhou's civil aviation authorities put regular airline tickets on hold to prepare for transporting military units.[85]

&gt; The army's entry into the city was blocked at its suburbs by throngs of protesters. Tens of thousands of demonstrators surrounded military vehicles, preventing them from either advancing or retreating. Protesters lectured soldiers and appealed to them to join their cause; they also provided soldiers with food, water, and shelter. Seeing no way forward, the authorities ordered the army to withdraw on 24 May. All government forces retreated to bases outside the city.[9][86] While the Army's withdrawal was initially seen as 'turning the tide' in favour of protesters, in reality mobilization took place across the country for a final assault.[85]

My question to you, then, is how you would address this issue. You have a protest with no signs of stopping, growing larger and larger with more momentum that threatens the unity and stability of your nation. Failure to respond appropriately could result in Civil War. Negotiation has so far failed, and now, it seems that the student leaders have no unified platform that you can even negotiate with. You have mobilised forces but they've been rebuffed. You can't do nothing; that will be an absolute disaster. 

What do you do? If I were in that position, I would agree with using military force and pushing through. The government's use of expanding bullets is wrong and they should have done a better job limiting the casualties and should have clarified no use of lethal force (they left it ambiguous,) but I don't think the use of military force against the students was a wrong move.

"drnkrku","Ever read Dresden Files? Long story short, there are winter and summer fae, eternally at war. Summer are “generally” good, winter are “generally” evil, with all the intricacy of being fae involved so of course nothing is straightforward. Not sure what your world is like, but the favor owed could be something to do with striking at an evil fae (or equivalent being). 

Generally fae love to play the long game, so depending on how you work your world, the fae could ask for the PCs firstborn, or power over a descendant, while applying a compulsion to actually create a descendant, lest they be robbed of a favor. This descendant coooould be a future PC of the player, (this is the part that depends on how you work your world). 

There could be some artifact the fae wants that is somehow shielded from its kind, but requires a mortal to retrieve it/use it (or the fae could just be too bored/lazy to retrieve it from wherever it is but still likes the idea of possessing said item if someone else does the legwork). 

Edit/addition: re-read your post OP, she could be irate with the foreigners, since fae aren’t quick to forget slights against them, especially one that causes a loss of their own power. The party could be tasked with tracking down and “obtaining” various children of said foreigners that she will bless and train up to be immortal keepers of whatever garden she is the guardian of.  Not sure why I’m so stuck on stealing offspring, guess it just seems like something a fae would do in my mind.

I think it's good because it forces certain types out of fandom and others remain. Again it's like the prequels. The public perception did hang for a while that those movies sucked, but that was back in the day when the internet voice was flexing it's power and that was all it would say was that the prequels sucked. We had tiny trash studios making hour long videos just to complain lol. It was a bit overdone and now all the kids who grew up are a part of the internet culture and they don't hate them, quite the opposite. Prequel haters can now expect to be called out on just being old and stodgy, same with this man. The last Jedi is good to a lot of people and the ones who hate it are probably going to be lumped in the same category of out of touch stodgy fans who can't let go of the EU or the OT or even the PT now.

I think you should give it time. I wish everyone could have my experience but this movie was brave and bold, that by definition means some will hate it.

Go back to empire, that movie is loved now because even the oldest fans were kids back then. But the adults back in that day felt that Lucas ruined his movie with muppets, he had a giggling jim henson critter running around wacking R2 and being a buffoon.

It's not a perspective we are familiar with but it should serve as a warning as we get older never to hold anything to precious and to always be open to new ideas and to new perspectives. These movies are for the youth, they always have been and I don't think disney cares if their market of adult fans gets split a bit.

The fandom is expanding and as with the prequels that requires losing the baggage and the dead weight, those of us who would seek to never try anything new or do anything bold. You can either have it the way you want it which feels comfortable or you can have something new, you can't have both. Kids don't bring the expectations we do and because of this they are always open to new experiences.

Try a second viewing, give it time. Wait for the Blu-Ray if you don't want to pay the theater money but really try to let go of your cynicism about the humor, Snoke is toying with her, mocking her victorious moment in the forest, showing her that he is so much more powerful than her that he can make a game of it. Ever see a cat play with a lizard. It's unnecessary and cruel, but funny in a dark way. Think of this like that, don't go into this movie with Robert Downey JR jokes in your head or baggage about how sacred it all is and how even the slightest mistake could set your blood to boil. Experience the story as kid where you don't know what it's supposed to be you are just finding out what it is.

Even the humor in the beginning between Hux and Poe reminds me in a small way of Han solos conversation with the imperials when he was in the death star. No it's not exactly the same its new and different. Poe is a hothead who thinks he can get away with anything no matter the cost, and Hux is just a pompous buffoon Snoke can easily control, and up against Poe he looks a little foolish. Both of them are foolish in different ways and their exchange shows it.

It does sound like you have some really negative attitudes toward men and sex. Like you really dislike men, and also see sex as something harmful and competitive, where at least one person gets used and damaged. 

There are some horrible men in the world (case in point, your boyfriend when you were 20), but there are lots more sweet, kind, lovely men. And sex can certainly be degrading and cruel, but it can also be beautiful, intimate, even transcendent. I've known both types of men and have had both types of sex, and everything in between.

They are independent, and have complete accessibility to vegan foods. What other excuse do they have? How can they continue to be considered good people?


If awareness and education were enough, there would be no smokers, drinkers, substance abusers, or obese doctors! We would all wear sunscreen every day, exercise 30+ minutes a day, and get 8 hours of sleep a night. And call our mothers every week.


Unfortunately part of being human means there is a huge gulf between ""I know I should change"", ""I must change"", ""I am considering changing"", ""I have started to change"", and ""I did it!"". Additionally, people need their own intrinsic, self-motivated reason to change. No one can choose this for you, and you cannot choose it for anyone else.


Judgement (which is what calling someone evil is) has rarely convinced anyone to change. You can call her actions or the consequence of her actions evil and cruel, but as soon as you start casting judgement, you are hurting your relationship and ability to help guide her to change.


We cannot control the actions of others; we can control our emotional response to their actions. We can help other reach their goals - but we must first take the time to build trust, listen and hear what their goals truly are, and then support them in achieving them.

could see alot of food in its crooked stomach when it suddenly started dying, think I might've fed it too much, think you're supposed to feed fish less in cold weather, and I don't think it was used to eating much at the store also,

I rearranged the tank last night too, which might've stressed it out.  I knew I shouldn't have done that.

think I need to try one more time with a stronger glofish though, if it dies again I'll give up on this experiment until I have more experience.

But that's not Venom, Eddie is mad at Peter for taking what he believes to be *his* spotlight and the Symbiote is mad at Peter for rejecting it, combined they create Venom for the sake of revenge on Peter and to torture and torment him. Venom is a great character because he is Spider-Man's antithesis he knows everything about Peter and can mess with him both physically and mentally; he plays with him, intentionally aggravates him, drives him to the edge of extremes knowing he'll never actually do anything once there and he does it all just to spite him.

If you wanted to do a film about the Symbiote messing with people's thinking and personality I agree it sounds like a great idea... *for a Spider-Man movie*. As a movie with Eddie Brock as the lead it makes no sense since Eddie is arrogant and cruel, but Peter's a nice guy and wants to be known as *Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man* so the Symboite messing with him, making him more brutal and ruthless against his will is a great concept but only on a character like Spidey, you do it with Eddie you're just making Spider-Man lite. 

And another thing if you make the Venom solo a horror movie where the Symbiote is the villain then wouldn't the end goal to be to get rid of the evil Symbiote controlling your mind, or at least make it not evil?

On toxic substances and children and natural selection: 

I guess I was one of those more adventurous kids but also very lucky. Just a few of the things that happened to me that I think are quite possible for less cautious kids but from which I had not so disastrous recoveries. 

Like most kids I was unaware of the dangers of vehicles. I remember walking off our property into the street when I was three or four. A car came down the busy street and I was suddenly aware of the danger but I was frozen and I remember just not being able to move and that frightened me. Fortunately my grandmother grabbed me and pulled me back. Lucky me. Another time my grandmother sat out a cup of bleach on the counter she was using for washing or something. I came into the kitchen and being thirsty I took it and attempted to get a drink. I was very short of course and it was much easier than trying to get a stool, get a cup and then get a drink. I instantly spat it out. No real harm. Around five I was at my grandfathers business where they sometimes used cyanide to fumigate, (illegal now) and came across a broken open sack of the crystal pellets. I thought it was sugar and licked one. By this time I was aware of what the stuff was but the ones I knew about came in a newer larger briquette form. The ones I found were very old and had been carelessly left in an older shed. I instantly recognized something was wrong and dropped the pellet and ran for a faucet to wash my mouth. I felt dizzy for a few minutes and later the tip of my tongue turned white. But at the time I was terrified I was going to die. At 15 yrs old I was examining my fathers revolver and dropped it. It went off and I was struck in the thigh. It could have gone straight up into my head. So, extremely lucky for me. I missed the evolution weeding out process. I never touched his revolver again and it wasn't until I was an adult that I purchased a pistol and overcame my aversion and learned how to use one on my own AND be safe. I went into structural steel welding later and became an expert and very safety conscious. I always listened carefully to safety lectures for our crew did every thing I could to help my coworkers be safe as well. On natural selection, I still partially agree with you though but I tend to think about it in terms of not coddling people who refuse to pay attention to useful information and am into social darwinism as it's currently called. 


&gt; An early use of time economics that must have been quite effective. Then again, our argument has moved from natural selection of individuals to threats to the group, which is a more vital consideration.

Exactly. Many of the Torah Mosaic laws aside from the temple laws of sacrifice seem to be not just protection of the individual but also aimed toward protecting the group from the spread of disease as well as protection from societal culture decay. 

One interesting aspect I think I see is that the custom of Bar Mitzvah not only insured a society that was universally aware of the laws but also a side benefit would be that just about every reasonably intelligent person would also be literate. The culture of every man being allowed to read from the scripture to the Synagogue would use the natural desire for public validation to at very least encourage people to continue to read. Public debate about these laws would also sharpen peoples minds. 


 &gt;On the other hand, one threat to the group would be a proliferation of the dumb or crazy.

For sure. I think the laws against incest would go a long way to prevent lowered intellect from what I read about the topic in modern studies. 

&gt; In turn, this would promote an agrarian society.
&gt; Excellent idea! I find that agrarianism has two parts however: first, that society lives off the land; second, that there is a manorial system to avoid the inevitable consequence of successful farming, which is a rapid expansion of population and then a tragedy of the commons situation.

At the time of the Israelite occupation of that area they were told that they would only be able to gradually displace the current population as their population grew. So their expansion was not rapid. 

Eventually, from what I have read in scripture this did to some extent happen and Israel was reprimanded about the gradual disregard of the Mosaic laws concerning the rights of individuals and corruption of the legal system. 

But back to the topic of natural selection in children, I do partially agree due to things I have seen with children. 

One of my cousins who was adopted had several children and there were two of the younger ones who were strikingly different. The youngest was four while her older brother was 7. On one occasion the father was ill and I was at his house helping him with the two. While cooking a meal for them the four year old entered the kitchen and instead of asking me for tea, (which I had no idea she even knew about) she simply stated she wanted tea and then quickly found a box of tea bags. I was intrigued and said nothing as she hadn't asked me anything. So I watched to see what she would do and remained busy with my task. She took out a tea bag and got a large cup of water. Then she placed the teabag in the cup of water. She watched it intently for about a minute occasionally sloshing the water around and then watching again. Then tried dunking it a few times and nothing happened. She finally tested it with her finger, puzzled over it silently a moment more and then muttered that maybe it needed to be hot. Then placed it carefully in the microwave oven and turned it on while watching through the window. After about a minute she took it out and repeated her earlier attempts. Eventually she had tea. How she figured all this out really surprised me. She even went and got some honey and sweetened it with a teaspoon of that and happily was sipping this when her seven year old brother came in and noticed. He complained to me that he also wanted tea. I told him, ""Then make some"". He looked at me and declared, ""I don't know how"". I responded, ""Then figure it out, your sister made her own"". He got angry and sulked off to watch TV. Their father never worked a day in his life, was always on welfare and five years later he got a girlfriend and murdered her in a fit of rage in front of the boy. I have no idea where these kids are now but I can guess which one will never succeed in life at anything worthwhile.

"dq2aagz","Adela looked to the gate, then to the Throne. She sensed the discordance. She could feel it was at its breaking point. It needed someone to control it, the power that filled it. Otherwise, it would collapse, killing her and destroying every soul in Death. The undead would rise forevermore, as the dead souls had nowhere to go.

As though on cue, Reyne's body turned to dust, leaving the Throne vacant. Adela had a choice before her. If she wanted to keep her world from devolving into chaos, she would have to make it. So, she turned, and slowly lowered herself into the Throne.

She could feel the Source pulse up through the Throne into her. She could feel the Song, broken and discordant. Vital and Necrotic power clashed, and she could choose to let the Necrotic power win, or force it out. If she let it win, it would simply return to normal. She would become like her predecessor, doomed to wither and go mad, only for someone else to take her place. It was what Reyne died to stop. What Adela herself fought to stop. The alternative was to force the Necrotic power out... but the Prime was the only place it would go. It would be hell on earth. Adela was not going to solve one evil with another.

So, she sung her own song. She sung to the Source. The sole voice now commanding it. She wove her will into it, into Death, usurping the Primordial's power with her own. She did as Reyne and Lilith had done, but she would not rule by tyranny and vengeance, she would not allow for might to make right. She would restore the balance, but allow for life, and mortalkind, to flourish and grow.

Adela would be the hub of the Wheel, and she would not let Death restrain mortalkind. She would let it heighten them, let it be a transformation that would let them grow. Life, Death, Rebirth, Life, Death, Rebirth. And so, she, Reyne, and Briar all sang as one, their voice claiming Death for their own. Adela would become Death. But she would not be cruel, but gentle.

Introduced though they may be, and destructive in some circumstances, in others they have a neutral or positive effect on their surroundings, and have some great sporting qualities.

For comparison, in inland Ontario lakes and rivers, there are only two native salmonids: lake trout and brook trout. Rainbows and browns are introduced, but common.

Budget replacements: Grove of the Burnwillows can be replaced with Copperline Gorges pretty easily but I'd recommend sticking with 4 Blackcleave Cliffs since all early game cyclers cost B or R, I guess a Fulminator Mage or two can be replaced with Avalanche Riders but one of the low key strengths of LE is its MB land destruction with Beast Within and Fulminator Mages.

#Last Week

**MINDHUNTER**

This isn't as boring as I expected it to be, in fact, it was really good. It's subject matter is one that has been overdone, like, I'm sure we've all seen a show with detectives trying to get into the minds of serial killers -and whatnot- before, but MINDHUNTER approaches this topic with such boldness it's hard not to be impressed. The atmosphere that is created here is mostly what makes MINDHUNTER worth it. Such tension and suspense, especially the interview scenes which made the whole thing quite riveting despite there not being much action. There wasn't much of a 'payoff' this season but I'm definitely expecting one in future seasons (not sure how many is planed). Especially the effects these interviews will have on Holden's psyche. And his relationship with Debbie...that has to come back into play right? Hopefully I'll get to watch the next season, I know there's a book but I don't want to be spoiled on how it ends.

**The Deuce**

Now I can't really pinpoint what this series is doing wrong, because on paper it seems near-flawless. Great production values, good writing/directing, good acting... well I don't like how old-fashioned the visual style is but I think that's intentional to give it more of a 70s-80s feel. So yea, The Deuce is good on paper, but when I'm watching it, it sure knows how to make an hour feel like an hour. This show demands a lot of your attention but is not entertaining enough to keep it beyond a certain point. Yes, The Deuce's realism and recreation of an XXX film era New York is accurate, but substance wise The Deuce seems unorganized and meek. Like, I don't know how I can watch a show with an overdone subject matter like MINDHUNTER, and enjoy it more than The Deuce which features a sex-based premise I've been wanting to see more of on TV.

Anyways, I didn't 'dislike' The Deuce completely, I got into it even more as the series went along, I just thought it had no reason being as uneventful as it was. Or maybe that was just an introductory first season? ....not sure but rumor has it that they are doing a time-jump next season, and if that's the case, I thought they missed a few opportunities and underutilized certain characters (Lori especially). Well, on the bright side, there's something hilarious about watching James Franco have a conversation with himself. He was great throughout the who thing playing identical twins you could easily distinguish.

**The End of the Fucking World**

Definitely the highlight of the week, and it was everything I expected it to be so there isn't much for me to argue (I did watch it in low quality though and hoping to get it in HD so I can give it a rewatch). The End of the Fucking World is pretty fucking great, one of the best new shows of 2017 and probably my 2nd favorite miniseries (if it stays as such) of all time behind Big Little Lies. I won't speak on visuals since the quality I watched it in was low, but the writing is fabulous. Dark but witty, cruel but touching. This series manages to combine so many things at once, and does so well. The main cast was what made The End of the Fucking World's strongest aspect though. Praise must go to Jessica Barden (Alyssa) and Alex Lawther (James) for perfectly balanced performances constantly moving between vulnerability and adult cynicism. And that unconventional chemistry between them surprisingly worked for the better. I especially liked how it ended, but I feel the plot could've been stretched out more, maybe even over 45-minute episodes instead of 20-minute ones. As is The End of the Fucking World is pretty much just a close-to 3-hour movie, and the pacing goes to show.

**Red Oaks** - season 3

You never know just how good a season finale ending was until you see the series finale. That's how I'm feeling right now with Red Oaks because I thought the season 2 finale was a much better ending for the series than the ending we actually got (I just didn't know it). In fact the entire 3rd season felt kinda unnecessary to me, just 6 extra episodes really, but even so it did have some good/funny moments in there. Huge questions though (which probably won't be answered because not many people watch this)... Why was so Alexandra Socha (Skye) so absent and were plans for the series changed because of her absence? I'm guessing the only reason she was in one scene -which was arguable the best scene of the season- is because she had other projects working on, but it was such a shame to lose her. Her and David relationship was what made the 1st season sparkly. Most of her scenes in the 2nd season felt out-of-place, and now in the final season I'm wondering what's going on because the script seem to have left her behind. I think David's new love interest 'Annabelle' might've taken her place, and there were a few hints on that being the case (they both live in Hell's Kitchen?). Plus Skye and Annabelle are both amateurs in the fashion world so yea, amma go with saying Annabelle should've been Skye this season. Anyways, Red Oaks was a very enjoyable series, the first season especially.

**Gunpowder**

The production vales on this thing is pretty insane (in a good way). But other from a few good scenes... meh. If you didn't already know this story Gunpowder is not explanatory. Kit Harrington is a famous actor now which makes his 'not-great-but-ok' acting standout more. Either way this series is a nice add-on to the English monarchy historical lineup which would feature: The White Queen -&gt; The White Princess -&gt; The Tudor etc. Now I wish someone would make a series about Edward VI and Lady Jane Grey which would lead into The Bloody Mary and The Virgin Queen plots.

**Survivors Remorse** - season 4

Survivor's Remorse was never a 'great' series but this final season was especially bad. And that indecisive ending.... I'm not sure why the writers would be so confident that they were getting another season, write a conclusive ending dammit! Anyways, I'm OK with this cancellation, I'm gonna miss Erica Ash's sexy butt though.

**Bad Education** (3 series + movie)

I enjoyed the series, it was a fun delight so I don't have much complaints about that (besides  Chantelle not getting some Wickers dick of course lol). The movie on the other hand was pretty trash. I was trying to figure out how it fitted into the timeline of the series, but apparently it's a spin-off movie so it does??? Makes no sense to me, it's like whoever wrote this thing was fucking around with the fans... or maybe it was written before season 3 was made and they decided to make it anyway after the series ended? who knows. But I wish I hadn't watch the movie, I enjoyed the series though.

#This Past Week

**Ray Donovan** - season 5

I know this isn't a popular opinion but I think this series has kept it pretty consistent so far. Yes, it is quite repetitive as it seems they basically offer the same content every season, but every season manages to leave me satisfied. The biggest surprised here is that it got renewed for a 6th season, I thought this season ending made for a perfect series finale, everything wrapped up quite fine. But I will be returning next season, I'm actually really interested to see where it goes from here.

**Decline &amp; Fall**

I think the 3 episode restriction is to blame for why this series wasn't 'great'. It's dry humor is an acquired taste and takes an episode or 2 to get use to, so having only 3 episodes was a definitely a flaw, plus the story couldn't be fleshed out properly despite being a very intriguing and adventurous one. Thanks a lot BBC. But anyways, I quite enjoyed this, but I feel Jake Whitehall wasn't exactly fit for the lead.

**Stranger Things 2**

It's definitely 'less' than season 1 in almost every way. Less suspenseful, less charismatic, less intriguing etc. But it didn't fall off its peak too far and is still a very entertaining season. The main discussion to be had is with the episode ""The Lost Sisters"" apparently. My thoughts... I liked the idea for the episode very much but it was just badly executed. I feel like this episode might be vital for upcoming seasons as well [](#s ""Eleven's father and all"").

**Sugar Rush**

I read the premise of this and was fascinated by it. Turns out it wasn't as good as I expected it to be. In fact it is very outdated. But I watched it, and enjoyed it too somewhat. But if it wasn't only 20 episodes I would've definitely stopped watching after 1 or 2 episodes. I also hate the 2004-2008 era because of how people dressed. The only modern show I really enjoyed from that time is Veronica Mars.

**Back**

It was fun. I had a few laughs. I think this will work better when there are more seasons out though. Seems like the kinda show that would make a fantastic series binge. That being said, I want to binge-watch Peep Show sometime, heard it's from the same creator as this.

**Ackley Bridge**

I can't put my finger on it, but something didn't click here. I enjoyed it but for what it was I think I should have enjoyed it more. To me the show just didn't have that 'spark'. Everything was just average really. There will be a 2nd season, If I'm around and remember to I will return.

**Alias Grace**

Way better than I expected, In fact... way better then I wanted it to be. After watching Anne I thought I would hate all CBC originals set in this period, but Alias Grace is pretty fucking great. Fantastic performances from Sarah Gadon and Ana Paquin. I also loved how they educated us on how stuff worked backed then. Interesting stuff, I should be writing a full review on it soon.

"dp8l59a","&gt; Lesson 1: Your wife will snoop. Practice good opsec. Use incognito mode, separate browsers, careful with mobile device autocomplete dictionaries.

OPSEC.  *OPSEC*.  Honestly, my partners could look through whatever I have, and they would be just bored by the results.  There might be some insecurity or jealousy, since I do not practice the ""kitchen table"" style of non-monogamy, but honestly, they'd find that I say nice things to and about all of my partners.  It'd be dull.

&gt; Lesson 2: She owns it. That's solid frame. Use it yourself, spot this in others and tear it down instead of letting them move on. ... But the reality a beta man experiences is that ""she has low libido"", and since she doesn't feel like sex, they're not having sex. It doesn't matter how important it is to him or how much of a difference it makes to his quality of life. Getting rejected regularly, having too little sex and the sex you do have is starfish, that is very rough on a man, and at the same time she is expecting exclusitivity. It is completely unreasonable and cruel, but with female solipsism it feels completely natural and not something she should even feel guilty about or apologize for.

Yeah, because she's not a receptacle for his issues, and if she should feel guilty and apologize for her libido, then the same should go for him, shouldn't it?  If his constant nagging and ""needs"" and ""I'm in the mood, why aren't you?""s are lowering *her* quality of life, then *he* should also feel shitty.  

&gt; Lesson 3: Women have no empathy or sympathy for betas... I'm sure that any woman who thought about it for even a second would realize that a) men find it annoying to get nagged at and b) hot sex is important to them.

Because being nagged *for* sex is totally awesome, and women *hate* hot sex.  ""Hot sex"", of course, being what *he's* into.  Not what *she's* into (which is jackhammering and nothing else, according to them).  Also, nice dig at ""fat girls"".  They can feel as attractive as they like, because beauty comes in all shapes and sizes.

&gt; Now we get to the real problem. Female solipsism sees it all as having to do with her: she's not the jealous type, and she really has low libido. We know the the truth. This guy didn't get his SMV up. She still wasn't attracted to him and his dread game wasn't convincing.

Replace ""female solipsism"" with ""male solipsism"", then.  It's all about *him*.  She has no will or desire of her own.  It's all controlled by his actions and he is in complete control.

&gt; Lesson 4: Get your SMV up. How about ""dread game includes just improving your SMV""; has lifting seriously become emotional abuse now? How about ""dread games is what cure wives of their low libido""?

Dread game *is* emotional abuse.  It's manipulating someone to make them feel insufficient and unstable, and if they work harder, they'll ""keep"" you.   It's unsustainable, because when you put that kind of tension on a person, eventually, they break.  People don't like feeling like they have no control or stability.  Lift all you want.  It won't make you more attractive.

&gt; Lesson 5: She has no idea how her feelings work, and she will label knowledge about it as misogyny.

The poster's response of ""I can't read his mind, so all I can do is look at myself"" is met with ridicule and ""she's so self-centered!"".  Had she tried to look at what *he* was doing, she would have likely been a meddling, nagging wife, trying to control him.  She cannot win.

&gt; Lesson 6: Feels before realz. The red pill isn't some random bag of tricks. It's masculinity. It is being honest about who you are and what you want. You don't have to take her nagging bullshit seriously. You don't have jump at her every whim.

Hmm.  I wonder if ""being masculine"" has anything to do with ""feelz"".

&gt; Lesson 7: Hold frame... even when he does the antithesis of MRP and drops frame and says sorry, she still thinks it is some MRP ploy.

Gosh, I wonder why.  He's been deliberately deceiving her and trying to control her through MRP tactics.  She finds out, and struggles to trust someone who wasn't honest, and somehow, that's *still* her fault for not knowing when someone is honest, though that person just said they lie to you all the time to manipulate you.

&gt; Lesson 8: The first rule of Fight Club is: You do not talk about Fight Club.

Yeah, if you tell her you're a shitty, manipulative person who doesn't know how to handle being in a relationship if you aren't ""winning"" or maintaining control, she'll weirdly resent that!  When she finds out you think she's incapable of love like you are, she's upset!  What's *up* with that?

Dude, don't lie to your wife or manipulate her.  If you feel like she's not very enthusiastic during sex and is ""phoning it in"", then talk to her about it.  It's going to be hard, and it's going to likely result in hurt feelings.  But work through that.  You presumably care about this person, right?  And she seems to care about you.  But you've torpedoed her trust in you, and now she wonders if the things you say are just further trickery, and she's *right* to do so.  You have to show her why she can trust you, and if she's going to stay with you, then she has to do her best to put this behind both of you and give her full effort in trust.

You have to own your shit, so to speak: you lied to someone for a *year* and degraded her in both words and actions.  It will take work to have a healthy relationship with someone who feels so betrayed.  She may not ever trust you again, and you have to decide if you can live with that, or if the relationship has to end.  She may decide she doesn't want to try to trust you, and end the relationship.  Lifting weights doesn't make your dishonesty go away, and SMV is a lie that TRPers tell themselves to make themselves feel like they have control.

"dozu965","
I appear to have written a book. Sorry. Just kinda let the following flow unfiltered. It's probably a bit disjointed and ramble. Again, sorry. 

Selfish, sure. Cruel and arbitrary don't apply. Is the judge cruel who executes the law? Keep in mind the law of God is directly related to His nature. God is utterly and completely good. There is no evil in Him. He is completely incapable of compatibility with darkness. Yes, there are some things not even God can do. So it is His nature that demands wickedness be cast into outer darkness. It's His nature that demands punishment for sin. 

The bible says that God is jealous. He's jealous for our attention and fellowship. He doesn't want to force us. He also knows that we are utterly incompatible with Him as we are. This was NOT his original plan. The plan was to make man in His image and live with him in harmonious fellowship. Adam walked with God in the cool of the day. There was nothing to separate man from God, until man disobeyed the one rule God set before him, the rule that qualified man's free will to choose, and then man became corrupted by sin. God cursed man, the woman, the serpent, the earth, and all things. However, God already had a plan to redeem man back to himself. It just would take a while. That plan relied on the second Adam, Jesus, to pay the wages of sin through a death he did not deserve. Jesus did what Adam could not. Live a life u corrupted by sin, and as a spotless lamb, be sacrificed so that all who call on His name should be saved.

We don't fear Hell, or death, and we don't feel burdened by our servitude to Christ. The Bible says his yolk is easy, and His burden is light. The burden given us by the enemy, Lucifer and his angels, is one of utter bondage to sin and is always followed by death. One doesn't have to consciously choose to serve Satan to find himself under his control.

 Ultimately we recognize that this blip in eternity called life will pale in comparison to the vast space of time we'll be in heaven. We look forward to being in the presence eternally with the one who made us. In Him is fullness of joy, no sorrow, no fear, or pain. No suffering or sickness. No death. 

So sure, we trade the ability to ""own ourselves"" for a season. The Bible literally calls us slaves to Christ. But in all reality, it's inconsequential. We don't live lives just weighed down by it. We have good lives all things considered. We deal with stuff just like everyone else, but we in large part avoid a ton of the snares people that do not live by the scriptures go through. Then again we do go through some because we don't always have total control over our flesh and we fall into other snares. But our Shepherd and savior is faithful to forgive us our sins (again, covered by the blood) and help lead us to repentance. Repentance meaning a turning away from sin. We don't believe we are free from sin until we die and are resurrected, which is when God will give us new incorruptible bodies that will last eternally.

So, in conclusion, we don't worry about the ""dictator"" aspect of it all. It's not a big deal. We recognize that if we don't serve God we will serve somebody. Serving God is WAY lighter a burden than serving the devil or even ourselves. We have and expect a good end. We look forward to it and don't fear it. 

And finally, as an aside, I think there are many moral arguments to be made that God is NOT a dictator nor cruel. But they're not really necessary. Judge  God how you will.

"dnyg6c4","&gt;What's the problem here, 

I only recently got dragged into this but I can tell you that there are a lot of problems and Aluzky is 99 of them. 

&gt;His points seem valid, 

Which points exactly? That essentially forcing a dog to accept anal is perfectly normal? His logic that betraying the trust of his clients and patients is completely acceptable because ""muh descrimunationz""? 

&gt;can you point out exactly what you are opposed to? 

I know you didn't ask me and frankly I don't care but my problem is he's one of the worst examples of Zoophilia I've ever encountered save for that guy who tortured and raped several dogs in Europe before killing them. Aluzky demands that Zoophiles be accepted as good logical respectful people but he makes a habit of going after other people's pets despite already having a dog that he claims he isn't really sexual with. He claims that being disrespectful to the owners of his targets is rude but perfectly fine yet when he's disrespected then suddenly it's a violation of his human rights. If people don't want their pets being targeted by horny Zoophiles who can't control themselves of be trusted around animals then too fucking bad for Aluzky.

&gt;The fact that desensitized training is a legit thing? 

So get a dog that doesn't mind anal then is it that difficult to comprehend?

&gt;He isn't saying he's going to train a dog to like anal. 

That's actually his position. He even claimed that if a dog didn't want sex or didn't like being touched sexually then clearly the dog has problems. Or perhaps the dog just doesn't like people touching it in such a manner. Would you like if a human randomly decided to finger your twat or grab your balls(I have no idea if you're a male or female)? I highly doubt it. Dogs will tolerate vet exams but aren't going to like people essentially trying to fuck them.

&gt;He's literally explaining to you the psychology of the dog mind.

Something he's still woefully uninformed about by the looks of it. 

&gt;I'm not taking sides in this one, 

You seem to have done this already having decided to rant and that other fellow who disagreed with Aluzky. Aluzky, to be blunt, is an immature narcissistic runt who gets mad whenever he doesn't get his way or resorts to treachery to get what he wants. Sure his critics are indeed very harsh and seemingly cruel but Aluzky seems to enjoy talking about them and too them so perhaps Aluzky approves of what they say. He hasn't blocked these people obviously and he enjoys engaging them whenever he can. Yet a lot of their accusations have yielded a certain level of proof against Aluzky. While I'm not exactly on the good side of these antis, I don't let my ego get in the way when they're right about something. Aluzky craves attention, that much is clear otherwise he wouldn't have gone to /r/The_Donald just because he saw one of his critics post there. I mean /r/The_Donald, of all places this drama queen had to go and spew his faux intellectual drivel he picks the one place that would more than likely be happy to see Zoophiles rounded up and killed. Yet he went there anyone, had garnered attention and then was promptly banned. Further more the brigading of /r/Zoophilia has increased as a result of /u/Aluzky flopping around like a stranded fish trying to ""debate"" and educate antis by screaming at them or describing to them how he can fit pool balls up his ass so he can take dog cock. Then telling people they're evil for not having sex with their animals and by saying if you disagree with him you're a bigot who's no better than those who hate gays or bisexuals or trans people. Not exactly a great introduction to Zoophilia now is it? Oh and let's not forget his recent endorsement of child porn, stating that watching a child getting raped is perfectly fine but raping said child is bad. He's Pro-Child Porn but Anti-Child Rape. He's aware that in order for their to be real child porn(not animated) that a child has to be harmed. Or rather he isn't aware which would explain everything.

"dmzi0y5","Thanks for that story.  Moving, and depressing.  I shared it with someone I know.

This account was meant to be an alt.  I made it in the summer/fall of 2014 when my Crohn's was flaring up, and I didn't have insurance.  I kept using the account, because rather than it being a quick anonymous plea for information, it became my life.

I lost 60 lbs in 2 months - would have been more, but my legs swelled up like tree-trunks and oozed water. When I sat in one place long enough, the carpet under me got wet.

I was trying to make it to January 2015 when the insurance I signed up for kicked in.  Threw several bilateral PE's right before Christmas.  Surgeon said I was also days away from abdominal gangrene.  They couldn't use clotbusters on me because they had to split me from asshole to groin, via my ballsack, to clean out the internal fistula.  I don't think anyone expected me to live - ICU nurses prayed with me, and a couple hospitals refused me as a transfer due to, ""mortality"".  I was 2 months in the hospital and in rehab.  In the latter, I filed for disability and read the mortality thing in the records I obtained for the case.

I lived.  Hooray.  Crohn's isn't flaring, at least not like it was, but I'm still not well.  I have an IVC filter for life, along with blood thinners.  My surgeon says he doesn't want to do a colostomy on me - one of THE most common operations on a Crohn's patient - because he's afraid I might make it through the procedure just to die a couple weeks later due to blood clots.  

None of this snuck up on me.  I've been sick since 2001, but became unreliable and couldn't keep a full-time job with insurance after 2004, and it was all downhill from there.  My flare that almost killed me lasted 6 months, and all I had was a few walk-in clinic visits, some prednisone, and about $1,000 on a credit card to an incompetent GI doctor that missed the pre-gangrenous abscess.

I'm literally in constant pain, I've probably lost decades off my life, and I feel like it all could have been prevented with the healthcare I was denied for about a decade.  But, hey, I just won my disability case, and I'll get ~$600 a month to live on.  I'm rollin' in the cash now.  Next I have to figure out what being on disability will do to my ability to get insurance/healthcare.  I have no idea about this stuff, but I guess I'll have to hit the googles before the end of the year and sort it out.

"dl82uj3","&gt;Anyone who’s opened a dating app recently has become aware of the term “sapiosexual.” 

Yeah, I've wondered about it for a while. Could this actually be a thing? 

Back in high school, I had the worst crush on this girl. My cousin and his friends called her snaggletooth, and they teased me about it relentlessly—well, until we got into a fistfight and my parents kicked him out of the house, anyway. She had other qualities that made her attractive. She was the only girl I’d met who enjoyed tabletop gaming as much as I did, and she knew so much more than me about so many things I loved, and she was passionate about her opinions, and kind in a world full of people who were petty and cruel. But was my attraction to her a matter of “sapiosexuality,” or just typical for a nerdy high school freshman? I’ve always assumed it was the latter.  

I suspect that many people who identify as “sapiosexual” are probably just signaling that they think smart can be sexy, but I’m not so quick to dismiss all of them in this way. Hell, I knew one guy who cared more about whether his partners were intelligent than he did if they were male or female. And we live in a world where people fetishize all kinds of things: feet, balloons, high heels, giantesses, maids, tentacles, people being swallowed whole, diapers, women who look like cats…but suddenly the idea that there are a group of people who fetishize intelligence is too much?

&gt;Those boasting being sapiosexuals list this sexual preference proudly on their dating profiles as if to suggest any would-be suitor shouldn’t even bother messaging them unless they’re able to lecture extensively on existentialist philosophy.

A brief essay on Kierkegaard, Nietzsche and Sartre should be fine. 

&gt;I’ve found a significant percentage of sapiosexuals use this label as a sign of superiority and separation. Unlike us plebs, they’re too cerebral to be attracted to “shallow” things like looks.

It seems to me like it’s easy to be threatened by the idea that there are actually people like this, and thus easier to externalize personal insecurities and try to stigmatize them all as shallow elitists rather than accept the possibility that to some people, looks aren’t particularly important. And to be fair, it’s probably more of a trend than anything else. But why would a trend like that start? Couldn’t it be that we have a cultural movement which constantly laments how we’re all brainwashed to appreciate conventional beauty standards and reminds us how put upon women feel when men look at them like slabs of meat? 

A part of me wonders if the real issue is that you want to find a way to make this a red flag for misogyny, but they won’t break you down to your individual body parts like normal people, so now you have to work at it a little more. But that would be a bad faith argument.	


&gt;Straight women in particular should be wary of men claiming to be sapiosexuals.

Ah, of course. This isn’t just an issue you have with an online trend. It’s a *gendered* issue, and women should totally watch out for men who fall into the pattern. 

&gt;The venn diagram of straight dudes self-identifying as sapiosexual and straight dudes with a penchant for mansplaining is closer to a perfect circle than anything Giotto di Bondone could draw.

It’s almost like men who claim to be attracted to intelligence want to show off how intelligent they are in the hopes that you’ll appreciate it. But no, I’m sure they were just being patronizing.

&gt;The last time I stepped out with such a gentleman, he soliloquized on the importance of Women’s Marches for about an hour. 

And you just sat there and listened to it? Why? Why not break these gendered stereotypes that other feminists have perpetuated and just “manterrupt” with your opinion? 

&gt;Interestingly, it never occurred to him to ask for my opinion as an actual woman.

Uh, let’s be honest. You think straight women should beware men who explain things under the wrong circumstances, and you let this guy virtue signal for *an hour* without complaint. You were in lockstep with him, weren’t you?

&gt;The sapiosexual identity portrays an insistence on dating traditionally intelligent people as a virtue, not a prejudice.

Given that we live in a society where people insist on dating traditionally attractive people, I think it *is* virtuous for people to shift the emphasis away from beauty and toward brains. Considering that human intelligence—and I’m hard-pressed to imagine a form of non-traditional intelligence that isn’t actually encompassed by “traditional intelligence”—appears to be largely heritable, we could do worse than to endorse social trends that encourage people to select for intelligence.  

&gt;Like looksism, sapiosexuality is worryingly reductive. 

This seems like such a cheap criticism. I’d venture that most people prioritize appearance and learn to adjust to the rest of the person over the course of a date. Why shouldn’t it be the same with people who prioritize intelligence? And I’m still curious about whether or not this is a legitimate phenomenon. 

&gt;Another problem with sapiosexuality is that it suggests you’re qualified to judge what intelligence is.

I think it’s fair to say that we can incorrectly assess the intelligence of other people relative to our own, but dishonest to suggest that usually this entails that we’re not “qualified” to do judge at all..  

&gt;But how does having a Tinder profile entitle you to judge a person’s intellectual capability? 

It doesn’t. Being human entitles you to judge a person’s intellectual capacity, and you’ll generally do it the same way you judge everything else about other people: in a manner relative to your perception of yourself and others. It’s kind of like how we can judge someone’s physique without knowing their muscle to body fat ratio.

&gt;One wonders, what metric would a sapiosexual use to determine the intelligence of a prospective date?

Most of us know what it’s like when someone is struggling to keep up with us in a conversation. Similarly, we know what it feels like when someone is so well-versed in a subject that we have to occasionally interrupt and ask for clarification. You probably know what it’s like when someone shrewdly observes a point that you couldn’t find the language for, or makes such skillful use of examples and metaphors that you can’t help but find them impressive. It’s not all charm, either: a standoffish, nit-picky asshole can be brilliant, and a witty and capable speaker can fall back on sloppy reasoning and cheap rhetorical tactics to impress


&gt;This preference embraces or discards potential partners on a single aspect of their personhood.

It excludes them on the basis of a single aspect of their personhood, the same as every other sexual preference; nothing about being heterosexual leads you to find *all* men attractive, does it? 

But let’s say that it’s actually more about what the sapiosexual finds attractive and less about what he or she excludes. This means it *also* ignores other aspects of their personhood that the rest of society uses to embrace or discard potential partners. What’s the problem? Are you suggesting that people should feel bad about *not* being attracted to someone who’s pretty and sweet, but not too bright? Or is the real issue that people are signaling their disinterest in a way that makes you feel like they’re patting themselves on the back for not adhering to standards that you’d probably agree are harmful anyway? Or does this whole thing just make you insecure?

Would *you* tolerate someone who wanted to throw shade at you for not being attracted to a man who was smart and funny, but morbidly obese? What about a man who was handsome and charming, but completely incapable of keeping up with you intellectually? Yeah, I didn’t think so. You’d remind anyone who dared to presume how you should feel about who you want to be with that *no one is entitled to your body,* and you know it. To hell with anyone who frowns on your prejudices. You have every right to be as discriminating as you damn well please.

&gt;Upon reflection, sapiosexuality feels more like subtle discrimination than a bona fide sexual orientation. And that’s assuming those claiming to be sapiosexuals are actually being honest about what really turns them on.

So let me get this straight. The problem is that it’s too subtle about how it discriminates? Because it kind of sounds like you’re suggesting the hallmark of a “bona fide” sexuality is that it *doesn’t discriminate* against potential partners based on arbitrary characteristics, and that would just…uh, wow, that would be too much. :P

"dl8114f","I've always had mixed feelings about this one. 

The first two ""books"" of the story are some of the best fanfiction I've ever read. Interesting world-building that leaves you wanting more, enjoyable characters, and some real great twists. Like seriously, the twist at the end of Book 2 is one of the best I've ever read. 

The problem is that - like many great fanfictions - as time goes on *Prince of the Dark Kingdom* falls apart under its own weight. Exploring werewolf society? Cool! Exploring British politics under Voldemort? Cool! Exploring international relations? Cool! Exploring fae and pagan magic? Cool! Exploring numerous supporting characters? Cool!

Doing all of that at once while attempting to write a Harry-focused plot? That's where the story starts to fall apart. The author didn't seem to have an overarching plan, and as a result the story ends up being too bloated and convoluted. A menagerie of every plot idea they decided was interesting enough to incorporate. They try to accomplish too much and as a result accomplish too little. At the end of the 1.2 million words I found myself asking, ""so what?"" Where's this story going? What's the endgame? What's the overarching plot/theme? It's hard to call the fic a story rather than a series of interesting events and episodes.

The original Harry Potter series is 200,000 words shorter yet much tighter, more focused, and purposeful. Not perfect by any means mind, but there's a clear goal it's driving towards throughout and a story we're meant to be following. *Prince of the Dark Kingdom* ultimately lacks that, and I think that's unfortunate because it has so much potential. Better planning or a rewrite would do this fic wonders. 

My other issue is that it heavily whitewashes Voldemort via AU. He is changed to a nasty but charming and benevolent dictator with an interest in pagan magic. Magical Britain under him is painted as...not that bad, honestly. Sure Voldemort is cruel, but his cruelty is almost always presented as for the greater good or against those who deserve it in some way. The democratic German Ministry of Magic is painted as significantly more racist, corrupt, and incompetent than Authoritarian Britain or the magical Monarchy of France. 

This is problematic for a few reasons. First, it's taking the easy way out. Rather than explore the complex moral questions of Harry being involved in a cruel and murderous regime where he's mentored by magical Hitler, it just sort of magics those concerns away. What could be a challenging and interesting story is purposefully simplified so that the author can present Voldemort as an ""evil is cool"" character. Any complexity is swept under the rug. 

The second big problem is the story increasingly reads like apologia for authoritarianism. Voldemort's regime is presented as efficient and well liked, making the trains run on time and keeping the masses happy and comfortable. The horrible nature of what dictatorships do to stay in power is for the most part kept well in the background or handwaved altogether. Voldemort's evil is superficial and ultimately doesn't effect his regime's effectiveness and benevolence. The French Ministry of Magic, run by a monarchy, is giving a similarly good treatment. 

In comparison, the German Ministry of Magic is presented as even worse than the British Ministry in Canon. Corrupt, racist, aggressive, and self-righteous, it's pretty horrible compared to Voldemort's regime and is the main *antagonist* of the story. The dichotomy is clear - authoritarianism is benevolent, well-liked, and efficient, democracy is corrupt, incompetent, and bigoted. That's a pretty awful message to be sending, intentionally or not. 

So while I wouldn't call it an awful fic by any means, it has some *huge* flaws both in terms of its structure and the underlying message it sends.

"dl7uuxs","Just popping in as someone who has undertaken the multi thousand page endeavor of trawling through the ASOIAF books... commence rant: 

The cersi Jamie sex scene happened *completely* different in the books. It was just sex, not rape. It's true cersi did have some initial reservations, but it wasn't that she didn't want to fuck Jamie, it was that they were in the Sept (exposed - anyone could walk in) *and* their father was at Kings Landing at the time. She was just worried about getting caught. She didn't even have a problem fucking next to their dead son, she just didn't want her dad to see. But after like 30 seconds of protest she's lustfully engaged. It wasn't rape at all... It was more like two high school kids trying to fuck around in a bedroom while their parents are still home, and one of them is worried about getting caught. 

I'm actually fairly forgiving of the license the show takes to change things in the book. Long as the TV series is, it would be impossible to capture everything that happens in the books, but so far as adaptations go the show actually does a pretty damn good job. They fudge the details, but nail the personalities and major events pretty much every time. Where they fuck up the most imho is Jamie and Cersi (and Theon, but I'll get to that). Some of it is stuff lile adding a gratuitously violent and cannonically nonexistent rape scene between the twins when it serves no purpose other than to make Jamie look like a dick. And that's what bothers me. In the books Jamie's story is basically the redemption of the dark knight; haughty, arrogant, best swordsman in the kingdoms with a rich dad, then suddenly all that is stripped away. He's humbled and powerless, and has to recreate himself as a new man. It's really interesting. He's still dedicated to house lannister, and does some bad things in their name, but he's always working to take the sting out of the evil he has to do. The most recent scene with Olena (spoiler alert) is actually a great portrayal of this: he has to kill the head of a rival house, but instead of torture he opts for a painless poison, and doesn't even change his mind when that rival reveals she killed his son (end spoiler). He's violent, but righteous. He kind of reminds me of like Batman or something... not adverse to chucking a screaming villain off a building, but when he commits violence you feel the thrill of *justice.* 

Cersi, on the other hand, is absolutely insane in the books. In the show she's certainly very brutal like she is in the books, but they give her a cold, calculated cunning that she simply doesn't have in the books. In the books it's basically a never ending chain of her making mad demands and her followers/advisors doing their best to dissuade her from ruining the realm while not themselves getting murdered by her. In the show she's depicted as cruel, but with a mind for strategy. In the books she's cruel and insane with no capacity for rational judgement, but constantly invokes her lannister name as if it gives her authority to make calls on things she knows nothing about. And all her advisors walk on eggshells around her, knowing they'll likely be killed if they don't follow her orders, but knowing that they'll also *all* likely be killed if they do.. Because she's insane. She's like the Mad King, really - all authority and entitlement, but madness where there should be common sense. The show almost makes you sympathize with her at points... mother to three murdered children, forced marriage to a drunk, etc. In the books she's contemptible on the level of any Bolton. 

Minor tangential aside on Theon, because they fucked that up as well. In the show post-torture theon is basically just nervous and a bit of a coward. In the books he was literally driven insane through torture, and disfigured beyond recognition. People who knew him his whole life don't recognize him after his torture. He's supposed to look like he's 65, with grey hair falling out, missing most of his teeth, missing several fingers (and his junk), etc. His internal perspective in the books is really... disturbing, too. He's constantly repeating little rhymes in his head (reek, reek, it rhymes with weak) because not only has he completely disassociated himself with any concept of being Theon, but he has been driven so insane that he can't remember the new name Ramsey gave him because ""in the dark he did not need a name, so it was easy to forget."" 

So uh... yeah... read the books. At your peril.

"dl7at8b","My point was that there are both good lords and bad lords as there are good owners and bad owners and the people still have no rights.  This is something that Tyrion literally says:

&gt; ""Ghazdor's collar,"" the old man boasted. ""Known him since we was born. I'm almost like a brother to him. Slaves like you, sweepings out of Astapor and Yunkai, you whine about being free, but I wouldn't give the dragon queen my collar if she offered to suck my cock for it. Man has the right master, that's better.""

&gt; Tyrion did not dispute him. The most insidious thing about bondage was how easy it was to grow accustomed to it. The life of most slaves was not all that different from the life of a serving man at Casterly Rock, it seemed to him. True, some slaveowners and their overseers were brutal and cruel, but the same was true of some Westerosi lords and their stewards and bailiffs. Most of the Yunkai'i treated their chattels decently enough, so long as they did their jobs and caused no trouble … and this old man in his rusted collar, with his fierce loyalty to Lord Wobblecheeks, his owner, was not at all atypical.

And later...

&gt; Yezzan's slaves ate better than many peasants back in the Seven Kingdoms and were less like to starve to death come winter. Slaves were chattels, aye. They could be bought and sold, whipped and branded, used for the carnal pleasure of their owners, bred to make more slaves. In that sense they were no more than dogs or horses. But most lords treated their dogs and horses well enough. Proud men might shout that they would sooner die free than live as slaves, but pride was cheap. When the steel struck the flint, such men were rare as dragon's teeth; elsewise the world would not have been so full of slaves. There has never been a slave who did not choose to be a slave, the dwarf reflected. Their choice may be between bondage and death, but the choice is always there.

You're right, but also very wrong. 

Your entire post is written with the attitude that everything about the military is wrong. And while it does things in incredibly pigheadedly stupid fashions, it usually has reasons. And those reasons are usually rooted in lessons learned with someone's death.

I said much of military justice seems to be needless and cruel to outside observers. And plenty of times it is cruel. But very rarely is it needless. 

Military justice is not the same as what you're used to. And reforming it may be a good idea, but you need to also realize that the consequences of military matters tend to be much higher. In the civilian world, the consequences of you committing minor infractions will stay with you, maybe a few of your victims. In the military you committing minor infractions can get people killed. Good people, people that did everything right and are dead because you decided to light up a smoke, or fell asleep on guard because everyone's been going nonstop for last 27 hours. 

I call most of the people that enter the death spiral of 
&gt;'fucking up' -&gt;'getting administrative punishment'-&gt; 'to breaking the rules of administrative punishment' -&gt;'getting more administrative punishment'  

stupid because 99 times of the 100 I've seen someone get punished its self inflicted. And not kinda, not sorta... Like totally self inflicted. I've seen a couple hundred people get messed up by the military, and can only think of 2 people that had a complete miscarriage of military justice. 

&gt;What baffles me is that you basically acknowledge that it is set up to stress someone to the point of breaking, yet then turn around and say that people are stupid idiots and ruin their life for no reason. You can't expect most people to be subjected to something nearly equivalent to mental torture and walk out unscathed without trying to do something to alleviate their situation. The only people who should be blamed for any future mistakes the person makes are those responsible for assigning this punishment.

And this is why civilians don't get military justice. You concentrate on the individual, because we as Americans are brought up to think that every individual is a special snowflake and should not be trod upon.

The military is focused on 2 things: The mission and the unit. We are in a job that demands that sometimes people die to accomplish the mission. Leaders and Soldiers alike know this and try to minimize the death of friendlies. That's the reason we keep leaders and Soldiers segregated socially, in almost caste-like systems. We have rules as to who you can have non-professional relationships with. Because we may end up ordering some of our subordinates to die. We do it because those people dying means less overall folks dying on our side. And you need to be able to do it objectively; so some personal entanglements are frowned upon, and others are banned outright.

These lessons the military has learned the hard way over the last thousand years many of these lessons. And we've taken measures in our military to codify the rules and put them out beforehand. We enforce these rules with as much transparency as allowed, but also giving as much privacy as you can to minimize the shame of it. And routinely we punish someone, and then push them to another unit so they can get a fresh start with people who don't know all the details about your fuckup. 

Another reason why this matters is because putting someone under stress is the name of the game in the military. Because combat is stressful. Unbelievably stressful. And when you crack in combat, people die. Hopefully its just the person that cracked, but usually it isn't. So if someone if doing something bad, we attempt to correct it at a low level. But if they keep screwing up, we take the administrative route and bring all this pain that you are offended about.

And if the person keeps screwing up and doing bad things we get rid of the person (aka chaptering) and get them out of the military. Because if we kept them, there's a better chance of them cracking under combat conditions and getting good people killed.

Or if you don't punish them, then other people start slacking off... And then in combat everyone is not at the readiness level they need to be or know how to deal with the stress and they crack and people die.

And I can feel you recoiling right now. That this system is messed up and needs to be scrapped. Because you can't get your head around the fact people go into this willingly or that it truly is that dire. 

The only way I can describe the situation is surgery. You do minimal harm but ultimately you have to harm the patient in order to save them. I don't think a surgeon is a bad guy for cutting into people. I don't blame the hospital, or that modern medicine that sometimes surgery happens.

But I do call BS on doctors leaving sponges in their patients. But I also don't say that a doctor made a bad call unless his peers can help me understand why a certain surgery is bad for certain cases.

"dkqikxu","""Darkness, silence, and pain"" are the prisoners main experiences in the cell. I'm surprised confusion and fear aren't up there.

I'm thinking you should but significantly more emphasis on the prisoner character and his feelings and experiences in the cell before you go into any dialogue with the jailer. Gives more time to emphasise his situation and expand on his mindset. I don't feel like I ""know"" the guy. You say his situation is bad and describe the poker, the dripping, and the raw skin around his shackles, but they're not milked to their full potential. Describe the feeling of his skin under the iron, how it's peeling off and the blood is drying in streams down his arms. Or use italics and continually reference the dripping in the corner (""drip, drip, drip"") as you describe his situation. 

The prisoner cracks a smile at the prospect of further torture. Doesn't seem like the kind of thing you'd expect of a confused, despairing, tired man in constant pain.

The jailers are a little... excessive with the profanity. I know you're trying to make them uncouth and cruel, but I suggest a more minimalist approach. If they're torturing him I know they're bad people, they don't need to talk about burning his dick off...

I'm thinking you introduce the idea of ""Stellus"" earlier on in the chapter. Have it be one of the things he gradually deciphers from fragments of thought while he's alone. Doesn't seem nearly as interesting if he hears it the second after her first tries to listen.

I don't know what ""The Flame"", ""Curse Pursuers"", or the ""Enlistment Act"" are. If I don't need to at this point in the story it's probably best if they go unmentioned and the characters only allude to them.

At the end of it all I don't really get the feeling I know any of the characters and there's just not enough meat there to really bite down on. But I think if you spent more time on the character, cut down on the dialogue, and gave the chapter a little more flair and novelty to hook the reader it could turn out to be a good opener.",1501057693,"i know you're trying to make them uncouth and cruel, but i suggest a more minimalist approach.","uncouth and cruel","cruel",NA,FALSE,"uncouth and cruel","uncouth",NA,NA,0
"dkqbjel","Hm, maybe The Prince fits the bill. It has a reputation for being a cold and disturbing reflection of Machiavelli's- uhm- Machiavellian mindset. But the truth is, he wrote The Prince as a sort of detached guide to how a prince should rule in order to maximize effectiveness. In school we learn that Machiavelli was cutthroat and cruel, but in reality he just recognized that most successful princes had the capacity to be cutthroat and cruel (when the situation called for such behavior). 

Machiavelli believed that the republic was superior to the principality. He wrote The Prince in an attempt to get back into the good graces of the Florentine ruling family. He was a statesman by trade, and The Prince was his offering- a compendium of his wisdom pertaining to the rule of a principality. So, the author gets a bad rap because his book is often read out of context.

Your mom's behavior is over the top. She treats you like crap because it makes her feel better about herself. She projects all of the bad feelings she has about herself onto you, and then punishes you for them. She seems to be a really sick woman, and your parents are in a really dysfunctional relationship. You can't save either one of them, but you can save yourself. The best thing you can do for yourself is to stop trying to fix the relationship between you and your parents, because you aren't the problem. Something is wrong with them. I personally wouldn't ever visit their house again, period, if they had me banned from their gated community. If they have you banned then that means they don't want you there at all, so don't go until they fix the problem. You will never win the battle with them, and make them start acting normal. They will likely always be hurtful, bitter, and cruel, but you can protect yourself from their venom. You need to set firm boundaries. Read the book Boundaries by John Townsend, it is a good place to start with people who have been in abusive relationships. Setting boundaries is usually really hard at first, and it creates so much N drama that people give up and think that it doesn't work. But it does work. It can be an inconvenience at times, and it certainly won't make the N a better person, but it will stop them from hurting you. When your mom starts writing ignorant and insulting shit in her little phone about you, tell her you are not going to stay here and be treated this way. Then pick up your stuff and walk out the door. When she screams about how you don't love, respect, or appreciate her, just keep walking. Those are things people earn, and when she is a jerk she hasn't earned those things, so why would she expect to get them. Don't argue about your boundaries. Your parent will throw every insulting and hurtful thing at you to get you to cave, but all you have to do is walk away, or hang up the phone. If they start sending hurtful texts or emails, then block them, or have the emails sent to a special file and let a friend read them for you or read them when you are emotionally ready.

"dkh1863","&gt; We don't always know what Varys and LF and Cersei are up to, but they portray a certain level of conniving that I don't see in Sansa's actions or dialogue yet, but her scene on the balcony with Brienne was a start.

The couple of ways she appears to have manipulated Jon and Littlefinger are also a start. But you're right,  don't think she is always relying on subtlety like Varys and Littlefinger do. She's also like Cersei in that she is openly playing the game, but I think she is trying to play it differently than Cersei in a number of ways.

&gt; and I think she is working on a plan to get rid of him when she doesn't need the army he has (which is a plot hole in my opinion, I feel like the Vale lords would dump LF first chance, especially Royce)!

I agree, but I don't think it is a plot hole. I think she's maneuvering into that. For all we know, it's already happened.

&gt; I just don't see her arguing with Jon at their court as part of a master plan she has though, I think that was genuine Sansa trying to eliminate any threat to house Stark.

But it doesn't eliminate it. It doesn't really accomplish anything, especially at this time, and I think she would know that. Stripping lands from two little kids doesn't really accomplish much, except maybe show you are vindictive, petty and cruel. But she can get almost the same effect by threatening it and then having Jon do the just and merciful thing.

If it was really an argument, I would think it would have continued once they went outside, but it didn't really. She brought up Jon being questioned, not really that he made the wrong decision in bringing allies back to Winterfel's side.

When they do talk about it, she says she learned a lot from Cersei and he mentions she seems like she admires her, but her reaction makes it seem more like she means she also learned what not to do. So she can look like Cersei and not actually take somebody's land away and make enemies out of them instead of allies.

&gt; I'm also not feeling she is trying to manipulate Jon (not that that couldn't change), and if she is, he doesn't really seem to trust her or respect her opinion right now (which could also change).

I think she's trying to do it for his own good, so he's focusing on the White Walkers and she is focusing on the game.

&gt; She told him Ramsay likes to play with and hurt people and not to fall in his trap (he did). She told him to punish the Umber/Karstarks (he didn't), and she told him not to dismiss the threat from Cersei (which he does). I wouldn't be surprised if one or both of those issues doesn't come back on him.

Well, I don't think everything she says to him is manipulative. Her advice about not ignoring Cersei was probably genuine and if he doesn't listen then you might be right. She doesn't always have to be right. She's got the game on her mind, but that doesn't make her an expert at it. I think the Cersei thing will come back on him in some way.

&gt; How many times are they going to have the same conversation?! 

I agree, and that's why I think her speaking out in the meeting was her manipulating the situation some, because she knows he's coming at this from a different angle with different goals.",1500554972,"stripping lands from two little kids doesn't really accomplish much, except maybe show you are vindictive, petty and cruel.","petty and cruel","cruel",NA,FALSE,"petty and cruel","petty",NA,NA,0

Thanks, but I disagree that the subject at hand is the morality of the characters. That's certainly related, but what I mean is that a protagonist who fails to challenge the status quo loses a lot of their potency. I'd actually argue that Yhwach &amp; Aizen do a lot more to change the Soul Society for the better than he does, which is weird.

&gt;Jushiro was sort of instrumental in sending a shinigami assassin after Ginjo and killed all his friends, resulting in Ginjo turning against them (as revealed in the novel Can't Fear Your Own World). 

As far as I read, the person who sent the assassin is unknown, &amp; personally I suspect it's the villain of the novel.

&gt;Mayuri is certainly cruel and sadistic. What he did to Uryuu's grandfather is beyond cruel. But during the Quincy war, he was literally the MVP, because of several actions that he took.

I'll agree that Mayuri saved a lot of officers' lives, but that's as far as I'm willing to go. I don't really want to get more into him than I already have.

&gt;And it's not a question of whether Kubo tried to avoid the topic. Kubo just didn't involve Ichigo in the darker side of Soul Society because Ichigo is loosely associated with them. He is not an officer of the Gotei. One could argue that his father was a noble and so that makes Ichigo an integral member of the Seireitei, but Ichigo was born in the World of the Living, so he shouldn't really wrap his head around the inner politics of the Soul Society.

He doesn't really need to get that involved. I'm not saying I expected him to go rogue &amp; start Soul Society Arc Mk. II, but there are a lot of small things that could have been done. Small scenes of confrontation can go a long way, like when Zaraki was being difficult as usual, &amp; that was solved by a short scene of Nanao basically telling him to grow up. That's not really the best example, but I just said I planned to move on from Mayuri, &amp; in fairness to Kubo, I don't think he ever really had the time to have Ichigo be informed about Unohana even if he wanted to, so it's the best I've got right now.",1499091541,"as far as i read, the person who sent the assassin is unknown, &amp; personally i suspect it's the villain of the novel.  &gt;mayuri is certainly cruel and sadistic.","cruel and sadistic","cruel",NA,FALSE,"certainly cruel and sadistic","sadistic","certainly",NA,1

Shunsui, for example, thought that Zaraki would be a huge asset for them in the war, and thus had Unohana train him, knowing that the title of Kenpachi hadn't really been passed over. Is that action considered evil? That depends on perspective. During war-time, a leader is forced to take drastic measures, that he normally wouldn't do during times of peace. This same Shunsui was the one who stood up to Yamamoto to try and stop Rukia's execution.

Jushiro was sort of instrumental in sending a shinigami assassin after Ginjo and killed all his friends, resulting in Ginjo turning against them (as revealed in the novel Can't Fear Your Own World). But Jushiro was someone who was loved and respected by all the officers and in the end he sacrificed himself by becoming Mimihagi's vessel.

I wasn't describing anything related to dictatorships. Even if it's a cultural norm to be cruel to criminals, if the region is experiencing a time of peace and stability you won't see any cruelty take place since there's little crime. Like I said, it's not that the people are inherently cruel, but religious teaching tells them how to deal with criminals/sinners, and those methods are cruel; they simply do not think those cruel methods are unethical when applied. It doesn't mean they can't wait to apply the methods - only if need arises. I.e. they're not ""sadistic"" in general.

That said,the levant wasn't particularly stable in the end of the past century, however Iran definitely was. Iran was quite a progerssive secular place to live (well, in the cities anyway - but rural areas also enjoyed the stability that urbanization offered).

&gt; Its not ingrained in their culture to be cruel, people are cruel if they can be and religion allows them to be. I think we may be arguing the same point but if you have any evidence or experience of it being a cultural thing i would be interested to hear it.

Yes, I think we are on the same point. It's possible that you misunderstood my initial point as so many other people. It is particularly the religious upbringing that teaches people there to apply cruel punishments to criminals. Not that it teaches people to be cruel overall - it doesn't do that. But it does describe cruel punishments for criminals, and since Islam hasn't really been updated/secularized (well, not in that area of the world anyway) like Christianity was, they still take those religious teachings and apply them as described.

This is what I think you can see in the video too. These people are simply applying what the religious teachings say should be done to captured infidels (ISIS). These people aren't cruel in their everyday lives. But you can clearly see that they do not hesitate to apply the religiously fit punishment to these ISIS fighters. They don't do it sentimentally - you can see they're quite calm and composed while doing it. It's not rage or hate doing it.

"dj0kmu3","I have previously discussed this with another user a few months ago, but I find her use of imagery one of her strongest points, especially during her Red era, and parts of her Speak Now era. 

1989 was definitely one of her weaker eras in regards to songwriting, but still proved to be a certain step above a cut and dry pop artist, through the story-like *You Are in Love* or writing based on the Alice in Wonderland shtick, but giving it a fresh sound again in *Wonderland*, I think Taylor had her strongest writing in her verses for the first time this past era, with *Out of the Woods* having some of the best verses in the entire album, second only to probably *New Romantics*, with lines like 

&gt;*""The rumors are terrible and cruel / But, honey, most of them are true* 

and 

&gt;*We show off our different scarlet letters / Trust me, mine is better* 

serving as standouts from the verses there. 

The song suffers from a dull bridge, and admittedly is an overused card from Taylor the entire era. 

Throughout Red, she displays some top-notch writing, especially in *State of Grace* and *All too Well*, both of which taking risks in song formation, and in All too Well risking any kind of chorus repetition. 

The amount of lyrical risk is very debatable for Taylor Swift, as she introduces a much more physical aspect of love and relationships this era, adding a lot of physical interaction in her lyrics, something that she avoided for the most part to reinforce her Love Story *princess* image imo. 

I can link a few of my previous write ups on some songs from Red, I am currently working through the entire album, looking at the song writing of the album, and I have even written a college paper on All too Well, as well as several long comments talking through my admiration for the song. 

My second point in regards to the topic is to what extent is serving to the crowd talent? 

Lorde and Kendrick both have niches they built for themselves through very diverse and set apart lyricism, with Lorde ultra-specific to her own life, with odd details to a specific relationship to the actions of the other half, and Kendrick writing for a population in need of much more then a pick-me-up from a breakup which people assume Taylor to write for. 

I find that Taylor's themes may be similar, and is a theme often used by most any artist (heartbreak), but it is done with an odd specificity that Lorde takes further. Taylor brings in common imagery of eyes, or the use of 2am, similar to how Lorde brings in the metaphor of teeth throughout her own work. 

Lorde writes almost exactly from her emotions to paper, while I think Taylor takes her emotion and experience into a more clever/situational experience, especially in *I Know Places*, one of the most *Taylor* songs on 1989, and even *Blank Space* and *Style*, the first of which you said to be more *something borrowed* then *something new*, which I think is a bit more of a stretch claiming it to be Lorde influenced, maybe a tad bit of the humor in the chorus of Tennis Court, but I think the subject material is very much in regards to Taylor's experiences, and features a lot of lyrical similarity to Taylor's previous work, with imagery such as *""cherry lips""* or *""swollen kisses""*. 

The premise may be inspired, but the lyrics I don't think are brought from someone else. I do see the HAIM vocal attributes in HYGTG, and I actually think the song needed it. Lyrically, it is also very much Taylor, and sounds like a song that could've been on Fearless tbh. 

So yeah, I kinda went off on a little tangent near the end, but I do see your arguments and agree that Taylor isn't ultra-specific a-la Lorde, or as broad, yet specific such as Kendrick, but she brings a balanced mix of relatable and specific while seeming extremely genuine that has branched over multiple eras that I think has kept her so big, and also shows a bit of her own talent, being able to transition her writing style to something radio friendly, but also keeping her own style to attribute her own style through imagery and story-telling narratives.

&gt; Long story short. Josif Stalin was the leader of the Soivet union from 1924-1953. This period saw great industrial advancement, social upheaval but also brutal conditions, which can be likened to the early industrial revolution of the west. Most famously he is known for the Holodomor, but an overlooked fact is that by defeating the Nazi's, he prevented the deaths of hundreds of millions.

&gt; The holodomor was a deliberate starvation of the Kulak class in the Ukraine due to their burning of grain and culling of livestock in opposition to collectivized farming. This led to food shortages in the USSR and almost caused a famine. Stalin figures he could kill 2 birds with 1 stone, and simultaneously starve the Kulak class (yes, they were a class, many are mistaken and believe they're a race. Oh, and kulak is ukrainian for grain hoarder) and fees the USSR.

&gt; Many see his actions as malicious and cruel, but what many do not take into account is that the actions were ultimately necessary for the survival of the USSR, and actually did more to save the western powers in world war 2 than they'd like to admit. D-Day happened in 1944, the Soviets had been at war with the Nazis for 3 years at that point, and were so ruthless in their killing of Nazi's, that the top german generals had to move most troops to the eastern front.

&gt;we will never stop repeating the same horrors over and over

I want you to imagine what the world looked like at the beginning of the 20th century, and then I want you to become aware how terrifyingly *new* the horrors of WWII were. Not even the concentration camps, but just the terrific level of destruction wrought on the battlefields by technologies that were for the first time being used in war. 

If you think humanity is bound to repeat the same horrors over and over again, you don't give human creativity enough credit.



Now to your more particular point:

&gt;[...] its all just a show we put on for each other

If the show we're putting on makes all (or most) of us *act* kind, then isn't that good enough? If we all agree on the fiction that we're kind and good, and then we all act it out, to the point that we convince ourselves, then what's the difference to that being out natural state? 


&gt;We like to pretend we're kind, thoughtful, loving animals but our behavior shows only a fundamentally vicious, selfish, and short sighted mistake of a species.
No matter what we're going to keep raping, murdering, and harming each other until nature finally corrects its mistake and the human race goes extinct.

I don't know what you think our animal cousins are up to, but most of them not only commit rape and murder and harm, but they generally don't even think there's anything wrong with that. 

If you have this image of Nature as this benign, balancing force, you need to watch more nature documentaries. Ducks rape, cats torture, most carnivores murder, and nature occassionally throws in a cataclysmic event because it simply doesn't care. In fact, humans aren't even the first species to fuck up the atmosphere so completely as to endanger most other species on the planet!


On the other hand, humans have also developed altruism. And while every story about a dog saving a human makes you think how nice dogs are, consider first all the dogs that never save a human, and then consider all the humans who go out of their way, sometimes risking their own lives, to save all kinds of animals (humans included) every day. 


For all the evil you're seeing in the world today, consider that you're seeing much of it now only because it wasn't even considered wrong before (rape, slavery, etc). Consider that you're seeing so much because we, as a species, have become *sensitive* to it. Partly because so much other evil shit *isn't* happening anymore.

When my national news reported on a murder in Thailand, I was so amazed to realize that for this news segment, they had found nothing more pressing to report between here and Thailand!



So I would say that yes, humans can be vicious and cruel, but that's not limited to humans. But we *strive* to be good, which is a pretty human thing. And some of our solutions will just bring out more horrific evils, as we're trying to find our way. But overall, we're becoming more sensitive to the many evils because we're slowly eradicating so many of them. And we're hearing about more of them, because we're growing together and are hearing about all the evils in the world, rather than just about the local ones and not caring about anyone else.

"dhb6ww2","I wound up getting my best GM advice from Paranoia.

No, wait! Stop laughing, I'm serious - and I'll tell you why.

Paranoia XP has some *incredibly* good discussion on how to set tone, control the pace of play, and interact with players in order to foster the mood you want. And yes, Paranoia is typically associated with a certain mood of frenetic PvP and screwjobs - but the GM advice (as well as the XP line as a whole) goes well beyond that. It *has* to. And it's very careful in putting solid advice in on tone, because if the players feel like the GM is hosing them, the game's no fun. The GM has to take on the tricky task of running a *world* that's hosing them, while still giving the players some kind of hope at fair (cruel, but fair) treatment. 

P:XP wound up making me a better GM, regardless of what I was running. It gave me worthwhile discussion on pacing, on managing mood and player interaction at the table, on making sure that the game I was running was *my own* and not whatever the author wanted me to run.",1494293148,"the gm has to take on the tricky task of running a *world* that's hosing them, while still giving the players some kind of hope at fair (cruel, but fair) treatment.","cruel, but fair","cruel","but",TRUE,"cruel , but fair","fair",NA,NA,1

Taylor broke up with Brittany, probably because she's awful.  Now being fully aware of the school's knife policy, Brittany and her friend went to the principle claiming Taylor and his best friend had threatened them with knives.

The principle was aware of Brittany being petty and cruel, but the same policy as before applied.  Both boys were expelled.

absolute shit, but i managed to grow and learn SO MUCH after it.

I started dating this friend, short time after ""the other guy""(first ever boyfriend of hers, that she kept seeing for years after starting in high school) went for like a year abroad for whatever reason.

i assumed, that since we started to date, that her relationship with the other guy was over.

Turns out, she was just...bored maybe? while the other dude was away. 
i even met her parents in her house for fucks sake!!


When the other guy comes back, i start to hear from her less and less(and later find out she goes right back to him when he comes back but keeps seeing me in the meantime)

We start to get into several fights, have a fucking horrible and long break up process, i run into health problems and she fucking vanishes, and that ends up being the last fucking straw.
I was not only a falling out of love, i had lost all trust in her and i don't think i will ever regain it.


After some time, we managed to recover a form of friendship if you will, but she never admitted to my face that she used me.
its like she's emotionally handicaped and actually didnt understand how bad her actions where.


Its been a few years, but she's still with the other guy, which perplexes me.
He knew, that while he was away, she was with me.
But apart from that, this girl, even though all her friends know the guy and see him at partys and events and whatever, she STILL denies having a boyfriend.
She will just say she's single. I know, maybe she's in an open relationship? but that just seems to be a one way thing for her only(the other dude has been head over heels for her for years)
I even saw her on tinder a while back, while they were still together!


I used to feel rage for the other guy, but then that rage turned into pity.

I ll restate this , the last time something like this happened , it was proven that America lied , it wasnt Assad , it was the rebels. 

Between him and Russia , he doesnt lack in conventional weaponry, that s just absurd. And if it would be about troops beeing tired, he would have used those chemicals where it would have reliefed ground troops , in some major battle.

Sure , he may have a reason , but why isnt anyone formulating that reason? And in your last line , you presume him to be..insane? He may be evil and cruel , but he survived an attrocious 7 years long war. So..we re gona give Al Quaeda the benefit of the doubt and just go with the narative that Assad had enough winning for a day , decided the war got to easy and did it so he could get..america in ?

Let me repeat again, America has tried pushing this exact lie before. Is it so unlikely they are trying to do so again? And if statistics are relevant , given America s track record , one should presume anything USA 's military or intelligence comunities say is a lie untill proven otherwise

edit : The main suporter of jihadi rebels in Syria is Saudi Arabia , and the main suporter of Saudi Arabia is USA. USA dumps tremendous ammounts of weapons in Saudi Arabia, and it is to be expected that the Saudis are pushing them in turn to the jihadis in Syria. Allso , USA has openly suported jihadis ever since the war began , under the thin veil of absurd lies about ""moderate rebels"" , most of the groups armed trained and suported by America have since aligned themselves with Al Quaeda or ISIS. The fact that the standing militaries of Syria, good parts of Iran and Russia have been fighting these rebels for 7 years in the most brutal violent attrocious war on the planet shows that the rebels are not to be underestimated or dismissed. It is a known fact that without USA suport , the war would have been long since over , and Syria would still be a place where people could live. Think about that for a second. Syria is aproxy war , and the jihadi side is a proxy for America. This goes to continue the long-standing USA foreign policy of suporting radical religious muslim groups against secular dictatorships

I know it sounds terrible and cruel, but part of the application process for any immigrant is proving you can be of worth to the country you want to live in. Or if you plan to contribute nothing at least have the means to support yourself so you're not a drain.

That's exactly how it should work. If every wealthy 1st world country opened it's doors to poor people 'just wanting a chance' they'd be sunk under the weight of trying to support those people.

The shitty fact of life is you're born wherever you are born and you have no choice about and just have to suck it up and deal with it. Some of us luck into wealthy countries with opportunity, some of us don't.

That doesn't mean those lucky countries HAVE to accept people from the unlucky ones (an argument can be made they should feel some responsibility for sorting out why those countries are poor and crap in the first place and help them as countries be better places for people to live. But again separate argument, and frankly i'm not even sure we have that responsibility unless we were responsible for fucking it up in the first place)


Whilst I can't deny the possibility immigration control may not be total moral/ethical/unbiased, allowing the wealthy or influential in is not corruption - it's exactly how the system should work. 

We want people immigrating who can contribute meaningfully - educated people, people with the means to support themselves and then pay into the system.

We don't want people who are just going be a burden, no matter how nice they are, or how much they just want a chance to prove themselves.

"de7dnsi","Warren Duesburry the third sat at his desk. Not his usual desk where he worked, but the one with the game. He was savouring the experience. He took many things in his life for granted but when sat at this desk he was subtly reminded of how fortunate he was to be there. And how much power he had to arrange this.

The huge square board was carved into the desktop itself. Coloured slips of mineral and glass were inlaid into the various sections. A few were metal, shining between the muted stone spaces. Some were blank but most had names engraved on them. Each careful script was added to a square as deals were made and land acquired. Some were landmarks of the city. Others the addresses of nondescript buildings. A few were simply street names, where whole sways of property had been bought. 

His fingers lightly fidgeted with each figure that had been placed on the board. Their cosponsoring files displayed on large wall mounted screens, displaying who was still in the game.

The thimble shaped diamond was in the fashion district. Not surprising. He searched his memory before checking the file to see how accurate he was. Laura King, fashion student. Or she had been when the game started. Now she owned half the boutiques in the city and was making a deal to take over a certain designers studio. Owned the building where the largest style magazine in the country was produced. Not a bad player but stuck in a theme. 

Anthony Gonzalez had taken a different approach. Laura might have stuck with what she'd known but Tony G, as he was known to his friends, had diversified. He now owned property in every part of the city. If it was on offer he grabbed it no matter what it was. His solid gold race car might have zipped around the board acquiring a little of everything but it had never been enough to control it. But it was fun to see that little car constantly on the move. 

Unfortunately the jade top hat had stayed still. Mark Jameson had been in jail for two years. He'd been caught in a property scam. Warren hadn't been surprised he'd been caught cheating. During the introductory interview when he'd explained the rules he had found him much to sure of himself, to confident, to be real. Always on show. It was why he'd made him the top hat.

Other players had been obvious choices for various reasons. The shell he'd had carved into a battleship was destined to go to Griff Davis, an ex-navy serviceman. Now half blind after an accident he'd stayed in areas he was familiar with. He'd been rather cautious at first. Local family businesses, small homes, offices rented to new start ups. Nothing special but they turned a reliable profit. Lately he'd been bolder. He'd bought some land on the tourist side of the seafront and was now building a hotel. 

Warren almost smiled at that. He'd expected Diane Guttersfield to deal with hotels. It had been difficult to draw her into the game. Her family owned a series of resorts and already had wealth, unlike the other participants. Instead Warrington had worked on her ego. Known as a party girl he talked her into joining so she could build her own business empire away from her father. A chance to be taken seriously had been enough bait and so she had signed up. 

The little dog she carried in her bag had been the inspiration for her token and now the platinum pup with glinting emerald eyes was sat firmly on the football stadium square. Who knew she had such an interest in sports. Or that owning four various sporting arenas would be so profitable. But her chain of sports themed bars and trendy nightclubs showed she hadn't changed much, she still liked a good time. 

The carved amber boot was Suyin Huynh.  The youngest player, starting the game at only sixteen, Warrington had watched her progress with interest. She had constantly surprised him. Thrown out of her home when her highly disproving asian parents discovered she was a lesbian he'd assumed she'd buy affordable houses, or open up a refuge for homeless teens. Instead she bought an art gallery. It was only later, after she bought up a local chain of coffee shops, did he begin to feel a patten to her purchases. He wasn't sure what it was yet but he was certain she had a deliberate plan in mind. Something personal yet the the patten was slowly reviling itself with each factory and shop she bought. 

But the plans of the iron were more obvious and troubling.

The titanium iron belonged to Hilda. She had refused to give a last name or any information about herself. At the time Warrington had found it exciting, a mystery player to liven things up. Instead she was ruining it for everyone. 

Hilda was a slum lord. She had quickly bought up the poorest sections of the city. Tower blocks, streets, whole neighbourhoods were under her control. And once she had them she then raised the rent to outrageous amounts. Complaints had been silenced after she had seized power over the water and electricity that flowed to her areas. Able to switch them on and off at will few were willing to fight her in the dark. And those who did soon vanished.

But at least Hilda had rules. Ruthless and cruel but there were rules. Alexis Dupont had none. Warren had finally decided he was just to reckless to play any more. His sterling silver cannon had been pushed off the board. Ignoring warnings and warning signs he'd put in offers on the worst buildings in the city; or on good buildings at the wrong time. Each one rapidly bought with no more information than what he could see and imagine. 

He rented to the unreliable, sold to the broke, made deals with the crooked. Every action was impulsive and unsustainable. And then the bills started to come in. Repairs. Taxes. Fees from the estate agents and surveyors and solicitors. He'd squandered so much of his money on bids and property auctions he'd had little left to pay for their actual running. So he began to mortgage his buildings. Each one paying for the next. Until he was left with nothing but debt and property he couldn't touch.

His final action had been to come to Warren Duesburry the third in person and demand more money. When he was told there would be nothing more, and that he'd have to solve his problems himself he'd started screaming it was unfair. Security had to drag him out and tossed him into the street. 

Warren had sent out his researchers to check on him and found out Alexis now had a single room over the top of a small butchers shop he owned. The only thing that was bringing him any revenue at all. The other properties were untouchable until he started paying off the debt on them. Warren doubted he'd do anything but wallow in self pity and misplaced anger.

Tbh it sounds like the issue is you don't know how to cook very well.  Your old diet depended on simple things like eggs and cheese for flavor, things that are cruel but convenient. 

Do you have a health food store near you that sells bulk spices?  It's stupidly cheaper than buying at your grocery store.  

Some of my favorite cheap seasonings/additions:

-Smoked paprika (for that BBQ taste)

-chili powder and cumin (for Mexican dishes)

-salsa (add it when you add chili powder or cumin) 

-limes (buy one or two and slice off small bits to add a little juice over your foods) 

-vegan varieties of BBQ sauce 

-Ketchup, mustard 

-Just Mayo can be bought much cheaper at places like Walmart than a normal grocery store 

-An Italian seasoning grinder (for pastas, which are also cheap) 

-tinned tomatoes with stuff like onions/celery/green pepper (add into stuff like pasta for more flavor and texture)

-soy sauce, mix with a tiny bit of sugar and some peanut butter for a bomb ass Asian sauce

Secondly, I want to thank you for sharing this experience. I can see that you (evidently, but your post cermented my thoughts on the matter), like me, care more about the well-being of other people than whether they believe in a higher power. You aren't out to hurt anyone, in fact, it's the opposite, because, as you said ""ignorance is NOT bliss"". I agree with all your points, so I really don't want to adress them; just know that I fully get where you're coming from and that I agree with you. :) 
It's also very brave of you, might I add, to, in the face of such overwhelming social pressure, to declare and/or decide to so drastically divert from the opnions/beliefs of those who you hold dear. That's something I doubt I'd have done, if I wasn't raised in a non-theistic household. In fact, as a Dane, the fact that some people would actually cut ties with a family member and look down on them for being atheist, seems not only absurd and cruel, but also scary and DEEPLY disheartning, especially when, as you exemplified, the parents/relatives actually often do it out of a misguided sense of love or at least a belief in the idea that this isolation of their loved ones, their children, from the rest of the family, will save them from Hell. It's so sad to see parents and children completely lose contact because of this. :( 
You sound like you've been at least a couple of years more on this planet than I (I'm 16), so I do belive you have had more time and experience to reflect on your life, not only as an adult, but also on how you were as a kid. This is commendable man; at the end of the day you're right. Often times, people can or will lull themselves into the notion that they're happier, when, in fact, they're in reality repressed and sad on the inside, full of questions and worries, but fearful to question or even approach these feelings (I think applies to many muslim women who cover up, but that's a whole discussion and not one I feel comfortable having tbh). This can be applied to basically anyone, people from all walks of life have these feelings. However, it must be noted that having a strong religious conviction, disregarding the way one attained it, (or any other strong, non-religious conviction/feeling eg pride, narcissism, ect) can help to repress these feelings further or to make the person experiencing these latter to feel guilty about themselves (Which is fucking horrible IMO). Of course, evidently, we cannot claim all religious people suffer from these thoughts or doubts (especially not in more socially liberal, non-theistic countries like mine), and I'd be a problem to claim that, but IMO that episode with your friend's mom seems to happen all too frequently in more religious parts of the world, and it definately is a topic worth debating. 
I don't know where you're from, or how old you are, but I hope that, now you've faced your doubts and overcome your fears, that your values and ideas gets passed on to the people you interact with (like me), and that you uphold the spirit of openness, hard as it may be sometimes. I know that I've learned a thing or two from this. Hope this turned out constructively for you as well. :)

I can sense this week is going to be a tough week for me both personal and work wise. I already am feeling agitated just looking at my emails. Most of my agitation is also stemming from the even longer indefinite stay of my grandmother in the house. I still have no bathroom of my own (my grandmother needs to use it and we've had to take off the door so we can get her inside with the wheelchair) and I have to share with my parents, making it difficult to get ready in the morning. (I know that's selfish of me to say that but it's frustrating for me not having a space to myself) The room where she sleeps is right next to me and it is 24-7 Fox news, blasting at all hours of the day/night. Both my parents hit an emotional breaking point last Friday. My dad just couldn't take it anymore and I had to take him out of the house to let him vent/cool off. He said something very cruel but realistic to both my mother and grandmother (I wasn't present for this). Essentially my grandmother has given up on walking altogether and has resigned herself to sitting around all day in a wheelchair. She complains about the slightest discomfort, even if that discomfort is to help her get back to walking. She's oblivious of what a toll this is taking on both my parents and is refusing to take the steps, quite literally, to get better. She's been having physical therapy at home and she can walk, slow and steady. Problem is she never does the exercises during the week to help her progress. My dad blew up on both mom &amp; grandmother telling them 'If you don't start walking or at least try to walk. You're going to end up in a home, bedridden all day.' 

I don't condone what he said or the manner he said it in, but I know that it was a thought we all shared collectively (except my grandmother). I know that kind of conversation would have had to happen irregardless, especially with my grandmother putting the brakes on her healing process/not doing what the doctor is telling her to do. My mother basically has only two hours to herself in a week now and is risking her job by coming both late and leaving early. She wakes up every single day, even weekends, at 6AM and is running to take care of my grandmother. My dad is missing work periodically to take her to appointments and all around helping. He of all people can't risk losing his job with retirement being so close and he is also risking his physical health by lifting my grandmother from the chair periodically. His back is going to get wrecked and my mom is already suffering physical pain from all the work she's doing with my grandmother. I hate that even with the help I offer it still is not enough. I feel very powerless to change or do anything else.

"ddarxdu","&gt; Are you telling me that a hunter-gatherer army can successfully destroy a rival clan and take all their women without fear of revenge?

Well, consider the [Yanomami](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yanomami). According to Wikipedia, they practice a mix of agriculture (with frequent relocation of villages) and hunting and gathering:

&gt; The Yanomami can be classified as foraging horticulturalists, depending heavily on rainforest resources; they use slash-and-burn horticulture, grow bananas, gather fruit, and hunt animals and fish.

They supposedly have a fairly high murder rate, and anthropologists report ""marriage by capture"" (which is a euphemism for ""kidnapping and rape""). There are plenty of raids and skirmishes. They move around a lot. Obviously, not all Yanomami do this, but there are plenty of recorded incidents.

Wikipedia gives some examples:

&gt; Violence is one of the leading causes of Yanomami death. Up to half of all of Yanomami males die violent deaths in the constant conflict between neighboring communities over local resources. Often these confrontations lead to the Yanomami leaving their villages in search of new ones.[22] Women are often victims of physical abuse and anger. Inter-village warfare is common, but does not too commonly affect women. When Yanomami tribes fight and raid nearby tribes, women are often raped, beaten, and brought back to the shabono to be adopted into the captor's community. Wives may be beaten frequently, so as to keep them docile and faithful to their husbands.[24] Sexual jealousy causes much of the violence.[23] Women are beaten with clubs, sticks, machetes, and other blunt or sharp objects. Burning with a branding stick occurs often, and symbolizes a male’s strength or dominance over his wife.[16]

There are other anthropologists, of course, who blame all this violence on western civilization. There are also anthropologists who are more nuanced, including Jacques Lizot:

&gt;I would like my book to help revise the exaggerated representation that has been given of Yanomami violence. The Yanomami are warriors; they can be brutal and cruel, but they can also be delicate, sensitive, and loving. Violence is only sporadic; it never dominates social life for any length of time, and long peaceful moments can separate two explosions. When one is acquainted with the societies of the North American plains or the societies of the Chaco in South America, one cannot say that Yanomami culture is organized around warfare as Chagnon does[15].

As the Firstborn of Akatosh, he's the ultimate Aedric God-Emperor of Mundus. To rule in the name of the Time God is his birthright.

Here there was no sign of hate against the past.

While the Turks put a violent end to the Califate, here people still practice their religion openly and freely.

Make no mistake. The Indians aren't stupid or barbaric. This belief is what brought the British to fall. While they talk about upheaval and revolutions just as much as any other Communist, the Indian branch understands that you can't simply erase the past by shooting a few people in fine garments. They know that society will always change only gradually, and while they will apply force to get the slow change they want, they will not force what they deem too rash.

&gt; There's somethin' bout the way / The street looks when it's just rained

Speak Now - Innocent

&gt; Today is never too late to / Be brand new

Red - Tie between All Too Well and Lucky One

&gt; And you called me up again / just to break me like a promise / So casually cruel in the name of being honest / I'm a crumbled up piece of paper lying here / cause I remember it all too well

or 

&gt; You had it figured out since you were in school / Everybody loves pretty, everybody loves cool 

&gt; 'Cause now my name is up in lights / But I think you got it right

All Too Well is just a masterpiece. I actually wrote a college paper on the song in a lyric analysis. 

The Lucky One is something I listen to a lot because I really want to pursue a music career, and is something that makes me think when I get too wrapped up in the need to be known.

No.

In a utopian society, where everything works together in perfect harmony, run by machines, there is really no need for a leader; this had been a hard lesson, but one that he needed to learn.

Now that he knows he doesn't have to do anything, he can spend more time complaining about all of his work on twitter. The ""*thank-you*s"" and the fruit baskets started pouring in soon after.

You are only beautiful if you feel beautiful and if you're happy. Both is within your reach. Your feelings show everywhere. In the way you walk, in the way you talk, how you eat, what you listen too.
Just... try, please. I believe in you and everyone else here. I discovered this subreddit when I wanted to know what was wrong with me that my bf wouldn't sleep with me. And in the end the only thing that was wrong was that I was my own worst enemy. Had I loved myself then the way I do know, I would have saved myself a lot of heartache. But had I saved myself that heartache I wouldn't be who I am today. And I am grateful for that, because it made me grow. It is painful and cruel but what I'm learning is beautiful, full of life, love and hope. And I'd choose loving myself and being single over being with the wrong person any and everyday.


I guess what I tried to say in this novel is that happiness can be achieved. Self-love that you lack is within your reach. But it has to come from you. No one else can do this for you. We can help you but in the end this is your job. It's difficult but very rewarding. Stop looking for your value in somebody else's eyes. You will be more beautiful than you've ever been as soon as you feel it and believe it. There is so much to live for and you just have to wake up and see it. This misery which you live in now is temporary, beauty is forever. Wake up, darling, wake up and embrace yourself, your potential, your beautiful soul. Everything that you are. You matter, you are enough. Just believe it.
Every time you say you don't believe in fairies one of the dies.
Everytime you fail to believe in yourself, a piece of you dies. But a good thing is, that you grow many more when you embrace all that you are and love the fuck out of it.

I did, you can, you will.

Cruel - Unnecessarily harsh or overly punitive relative to the nature of the original crime. 

Unusual - Not typically a punishment assigned for the type of crime committed. 

In the U.S., having someone write an essay as punishment for a minor crime is legal because it is unusual but is not cruel. Sentencing a murderer to death is legal because it is cruel but not unusual. Sentencing a pickpocket to death is illegal because it is cruel AND unusual. 

The purpose of the clause was to ensure that criminals were not excessively punished for minor crimes, or tortured to death for major ones. The British were masters of finding creative ways to kill people they didn't like, and the American founders wanted to ensure that America didn't follow suit. The success of that attempt is debatable, at best.",1482257072,"in order to violate the eighth, a punishment must be both cruel and unusual.","cruel and unusual","cruel",NA,FALSE,"cruel and unusual","unusual",NA,NA,1

"db88qa8","Revenge evolved as a public display for deterrence, you can bet that when people in the old past took revenge they carried around the opponents head on a spear as a generic ""don't fuck with me bro"" message. However it is possible that this evolved a certain desire or taste for revenge so now it feels satisfying even if it is enacted entirely in private.  Indeed many old novels seem to be about cases of secret revenge.

Secret revenge is irrational, only serves an evolved desire who actual function is public ""no fucking with me"" messages.

The general difference is that for deterrence publicity &gt; cruelty, while for that evolved instinct cruelty &gt; publicity.

"db0qg43","Not to justify the emotional abuse in religious groups and by religious organizations, but to be accurate and informational, let me explain the following. Legally, JWs or WTS are not violating human rights. 

  Article 16, p.3 does not mean that a family can't expel or abandon it's member. It means that a government or anyone else is not allowed to forcefully break a family and that the State protects against such action. Emotionally manipulating/influencing someone to take voluntary action inside their own family is not covered here.

  Article 18, that right is granted for every JW in the US. Again, this article does not say that your former religion does not have the right to shun and abandon you or to suggest your family do the same. You have your rights and they have theirs.

  Article 19, again, the right is perfectly granted. Shunning or abandoning someone in private relations is not violating that article. The rights are mutual and are protected mutually. Just as anyone has the right to express their opinions, others have right to respond in any legal way.

  Article 20, completely granted. WTS does not compel anyone to remain a member. It takes as much as to clearly tell them that you do not consider yourself a JW any more and they will strike down your name. As with previous articles, we need to understand that causing emotional discomfort is not violation of human rights.

I'm just saying all this because I see it so much that people mix up ""illegal"" and ""unethical"". Cults like WTS run their dirty business, it's dirty and immoral and unethical, *but it is not illegal*. There is a plethora of things in this world which are extremely devastating and cruel, but they are not illegal, they are not a violation of human rights.

Again, irrelevant. And no, these shootings just grab more headlines. The violence through out these Muslim countries are numerous and these countries are ALREADY ISLAMIC. The problem is that these people want to live in a Muslim country, while immigrating here.

&gt; We seem to have a lot of those people already here. They are called Evangelical Christians and the less moderate alt-right.

WHO ARE CITIZENS! We can't remove their citizenship! We can't block their immigration since they're already here!

&gt; We (the US with significant or token support from may European and Oceanic countries) gave rise to ISIS with our ""freedom"". 

Correction, we created the power vacuum that allowed ISIS to rise to power in Iraq. We did not create ISIS. The Wahhabi extremists were already there and biting at the bit to take over. The reason they couldn't was that Saddam was in power and actively suppressing them.

&gt; At a certain point we are responsible for the refugees that are created from these conflicts.

No, we're not. Maybe in Iraq, but we didn't create ISIS. Sure, there have been (incredibly stupid) weapons deals with small extremist groups. But we did not fund ISIS' rise to power. Syria is not our fault, nor is it anywhere else. The civil war, which was bound to happen anyways, has quite a few extremists against Assad, and they were there before ISIS. Some are even against ISIS.

&gt;  But that means some other country has to take up that responsibility

No they don't. They can, and are welcome to, but they don't have to. Call it cruel, but most countries want to put their citizens above random people half-way around the world.

&gt; they should be compensated by countries shirking responsibility

No they don't. The countries ""shirking"" responsibility are doing so because they aren't responsible for those people. They're responsible for their own citizens. 

&gt;  If you're willing to talk about compensation and subsidies, I would not be at all opposed to it.

No. Unless we add another 51st state, we are not responsible for the Syrians. Maybe, maybe some additional financial support in Iraq (which we're already doing) as a you-break-it-you-buy-it. But again, the country was full of these shitheads. They would have come out the second Saddam lost power.

You want to know what we should do? Get a peace deal with Assad and the more liberal rebels. Cut ties with and issue sanctions against Saudi Arabia (and similar countries) until they stop supporting terrorism. Lead a coalition to subdue ISIS with as many other world powers as possible (in process). Including Russia (not in process). We push for secularism and education in these countries. We fund non-profits that can aid in that front as well as around the world. We give better trade deals to countries that reduce and remove extremist policies. Not a direct funding, since that never works and instead goes to the pockets of dictators and terrorists.

Literally the entire DH campaign revolves around finding Illidan's Demon soul. Also Xe'ra.

You are. Because you have a Demon soul. The other Demon Hunters don't have one, that's why Illidan was surprised that you did.

Don't confuse between the player-character's (or Illidan's) Demonic soul (which makes them immortal as long as they don't die in the Nether) and the actual souls of the Demons you consume. The later and Fel energy cause the former.

"d9o5yyl","This is the way of it:

I was with Victor. We had drank and laughed and sang in the streets of old Brust. It was payday and the war was coming. Soon, we knew, there would no longer be nights like this, so free and wild and whole. We knew enough to make the most of the time we had.

Having drank our money and pissed our prize, we danced down the dark, lampless avenues of dear old Brust. Light spilled out from the windows of houses and alehouses and the stars reflected down upon the black puddles that always ran so deep in the choked and pitiless gutters. We were young, but we did not have time. And this is never a good combination.

A wretch of an old man lay sprawled upon a bench where the avenue narrowed and the houses were replaced by creeping forest. Victor kicked the man in the backside and danced away, gulping great swigs of air as he laughed himself red. The man roused and turned.

""Who's there?"" said the old man.

""It's God,"" said Victor, sniffling and teary-eyed with laughter. ""God Himself. Come to claim you. So rise and prepare for judgment!""

The old man swung slow and shaky to his feet. His eyes were pearl white. He frowned and shook his head. ""No, no. God hasn't claimed me among his number for decades long past. I can't see why he'd come now, when nothing's changed.""

""It doesn't matter, does it?"" said Victor, almost upset that the man wasn't angry or scared or any of the things Victor had hoped he'd be. ""It's judgment for you. You've had long enough. Long enough and what's it come to?""

The old man's blind eyes swept across the pair of us. ""Ah. Is that what it is? A boy afraid of death, angry at an old man for not being dead? I couldn't take your place if I wanted to.""

Victor kicked the man again, hard, straight in the chest, in the depths of his soiled wool coat. ""They oughta send you. Stick a gun in your worthless hands and let you march."" Victor spat on the ground. ""What's the sense in it? What's the sense at all?""

I grabbed at Victor's thin coat. ""Let's go,"" I said. ""There's starlight yet. More night for us.""

Victor shrugged me away. 

""Don't be mad at me,"" said the old man. ""It was He who made things this way. Boys like you are little more than lumps of coal in this cold world. Tossed into the fire to keep the young and old warm. Best you can hope is to live long enough to become old men with shovels.""

It was cruel, but honest. I saw that at least. But not Victor. He dove upon the man and set his hands to the blind man's throat. The old man hardly struggled. He made no sound. At least not in that first moment. Because as Victor snarled and struggled against the frail frame of the old man, I turned and ran. 

Down pitch black streets, I ran. Long and wild, I ran. No direction and no particular purpose beyond flight itself. I ran.

By daybreak I was exhausted and ill. I fell down upon the grass of a small hill and pulled off my coat. I tried not to think on what I had seen and what I had done.

I slept.

I awoke with a start, confused and frightened. The day was bright. There were voices. Small, gibbering voices all around me. Children. On the hill?

But I wasn't on the hill. It was a carnival. A trumpet man marched past, joyfully rattling brass. Children ran by. A man on stilts. The smell of butter and roasted lamb. 

I rotated, slowly, as if by the wind. I strained to move, to shift about, but nothing happened. I moved only as the wind allowed.

A crush of colored balloons. All around me. A man in a striped shirt and red vest.

The sun was bright. I was keenly aware of the laughter and the shouts of joy. A feeling of lightness. 

A boy was before me. Blond, flop-haired and round-headed. His teeth were crooked like a rotten fence. He beamed as he pointed at me. I wanted to ask what he wanted, but found I could say nothing. Do nothing. 

The man in the red vest took a coin from the boy and placed it in his pocket. Then I was tugged. Loosened. Dragged through the air by a line of string. The string went into the boy's hand and then he was running. Running hard and fast, across the carnival, across the sun-bleached cobblestones. Towards nothing. Towards no one.

The boy ran and whooped and I danced along behind him.

And it was fine. I did not mind it. I did not begrudge the boy his joy or his power over me. I was a balloon, I realized. A thing of joy. Thin and insubstantial.

Perhaps this was the best I could do. Perhaps it was the best any of us could do.

I stayed with the boy, until his attention drifted and then...I was free again. I floated upwards. Ever upwards. I wondered why this was the best I could do with my freedom. And still I climbed. Towards the sky and the sun and the stars. And down below all of old Brust was laid before me. Bright and crippled and bleeding on all sides. My home. My beautiful home.

I floated past Brust, into strange foreign lands, with strange foreign rivers and strange foreign hills. But still beautiful. Just not as. 

Finally, after how long I do not know, I fell. Far away from Brust. Far away from home. I fell. Limp and floating. Like a feather. I fell.

And that was my dream. Now I wait - I wait to wake up. I wait to go home.

I agree; with kids, you can give them the information and decide what meals are served in the house, but ultimately it's up to them what happens while outside the house.

A lot of people still use old leather products because the damage was already done and continuing to use it doesn't raise demand. But I'm glad you replaced it if it was making you uncomfortable.

"d9gxfqx","#Nagaland has beef with Delhi for bid to ban dog meat

Guwahati

Nagaland attacked Union minister Maneka Gandhi over a move to ban consumption of dog meat — like beef elsewhere in India — in the North-east.

Dog meat is a delicacy among many Naga tribes in Nagaland and adjoining states as well as some communities in Mizoram.

In a letter to department of north eastern region minister Jitendra Singh a few days ago, Gandhi cited the Food Safety and Standards Regulation Act, 2011, that does not allow dogs, cats and other animals to be slaughtered for food. She said consumption of dog meat was both illegal and cruel.

But Nagas say Gandhi has no business telling them what they cannot eat or wield rules that are not applicable in Nagaland.

“Indian laws, related to religion or food habits, cannot be imposed in Nagaland because the state’s special status ensures preservation of social customs. We have been eating dog meat, as therapy too, for generations and we cannot stop eating now just because someone feels we should not,” Chuba Ozukum, president of Nagaland’s apex social organisation Naga Hoho, said.

Nagas, he added, will oppose strongly if the ban on sale and consumption of dog meat is imposed.

Officials of Nagaland’s health department said they were looking into the cruelty aspect. “We have asked traders and butchers to follow proper procedures on treating dogs and other animals for consumption,” Abhijit Sinha, commissioner-secretary in the department, said.

The state’s additional chief secretary, RB Thong, said enforcing a dog meat ban would be very difficult.

Fearing public backlash, the Nagaland government went slow on a legal notice that an Assam-based petitioner had sent in March against illegal trade of dogs for consumption. Though the demand for dog meat is high — a kilo sells for '300-500 depending on availability — the animal is not farmed for consumption. The dogs for most kitchens and ethnic restaurants are thus smuggled from neighbouring states, mainly Assam.

"d91sz5m","Hi redshirt,
 as others pointed out, we Catholics don't know for sure what happens to unborn children in terms of Heaven/Hell. I personally really hope they go to Heaven but it's not a certainty. Having said that, it's beside the point and doesn't apply to your argument since you could just say ""okay baptize the baby and kill it immediately afterward"" right?

&gt;But why doesn't the end justify the means? 

Basically, end does not justify means because that's not how we believe judgement/justice/morality works. When I'm at the pearly gates St. Peter won't count how many people I ensured got into Heaven, but how good of a person I was.


&gt;Aren't we far better off saving as many souls as possible? 

Who is ""we""? If you mean the *killer* then clearly no: God put the baby on earth and the killer went against that - also 5th commandment.


If you mean the *baby* then not necessarily. In Heaven, we participate in the glory/goodness/awesomeness/love of God. The more we grow in this life, the more we get to participate in this. (Like a larger bucket filled with more Grace.) So yes if a baptized baby is killed they are in Heaven but their bucket is small. If they live they get a chance to grow that bucket and still go to Heaven. 


I'm going to try to make a utilitarian argument as well, not sure how valid it is since as I said I don't believe morality works like that, but here we go:
Maybe the expected 'total bucket volume' in Heaven is larger when people live full natural lives even with some of them not choosing God, than if everyone was there but killed before birth.

Anyway, that seems really cold and cruel, but then again so are utilatarian ethics so ¯\_(ツ)_/¯


&gt;Isn't this life completely meaningless when compared to spending all of eternity with God?

Agreed.


&gt;But shouldn't you still be happy for the baby that died?

I guess that there's a consolation in that the baby (probably) goes straight to Heaven. I do feel bad that they don't get a chance to make a conscious rational choice for God and also for the hurt it causes the mother and rest of the family. Also I feel really bad for the killer :(



&gt;Seems like that more than outweighs the downside.

I totally get what you are saying but also I know that God doesn't think so: if it was better that we all go to Heaven, he would just have created saint robots that can't make immoral choices, only good ones. But somehow having the chance to choose God, therefore actually loving Him (and not just being programmed to do so) is better. 

Final point, in almost all of your questions you already assume utilitarian ethics (outweighs downside/better off/ etc). Maybe under utilitarian ethics, it would be 'better' for me to kill baptized babies every chance I get, but I don't believe that those ethics are correct so that's irrelevant to me as a Christian.

In all honesty though. As people we can't make the decision to just let the syrians do their thing and let get people and children killed because it is cruel.

That is why the elected GOVERNMENTS have to make that decision if necessary. Because the governments must be able to see the bigger picture. They must make cruel decisions if necessary.

I - as a person - can't say: ""Helping to get Assad out of office was a bad Idea and even if people died, he was the best available option"".

It's even more impossible to say:""Let the Russians do their thing and stabilize Syria. It will cost lives but is the best available option"".

Merkel threw all that out the window. She can't out won't make any necessary decisions. She only said: ""Wir schaffen das"". (We can do that) and opened the borders.

And (naive) people are happy, because liberal politicians tell fairy tales where everything is black and white and everything has a happy ending.

"d8d6sxn","Dude I feel you. I'm flirting with this cute girl right now and walk away every time asking myself wtf am I doing? Am I going to do this or what. Why am I hesitating? I don't have the same fears you do but I'm older and I don't care as much how people look at me. I do understand trying to mull over what's happening. I had to accept a few things myself a while ago. I had to accept it twice in fact in my life. Had no idea how crippling it was until I let it just happen and told myself it's ok, this is normal. Carry on with your day.

Look. Normality is just a bullshit scheme people create to keep order of their own world. There is no such thing, it's what you make of it and what you accept. What's normal to you here is not normal in China, Russia, Zimbabwe, France, Oman, etc. So it's all just in your head. It's what society sets out, but that's progressing as time goes by. My normal is....everyone gets to love who they want and as long as it isn't abusive or toxic I'm happy for them. 

Another thing...if you think kissing or wanting to kiss some one of the same sex is what straight people do you are mistaken. I thought something similar too about women with certain things and found out that is not how people think. Oh. Oops.
  
Also, It's ok. You may not be gay. You may not even be bi or maybe you are and that's fine too. There are a lot of us hidden in plain sight. Some people meet people and it's a connection that is powerful and it never happens again. Some people realize it opens a whole new spectrum for them to understand and explore. Your fear is what the world is telling you. Not what you are telling you. Do you really care if you are gay, bi, or anything else? Or do you care that others care? It's a new label but you are still you. Yes the real world is complicated and cruel but guess what...you get to chose to remove people who love you only conditionally because screw conditional love. It has rules and it boxes you into some one else's idea of you. You got something special here...that's wonderful.

What would happen if you just talk to them and ask how they feel about you? And if they are interested in finding out more? Maybe take it slow? Spend more time alone together. 

Don't let shit pass you by. Even if he flat out rejects you and panics, you should endure that and know. But that's just me. I rather feel the pain of knowing then live wondering. just don't let it drive your feelings to bury. Pain is good and it's cleansing and enlightening. I went through a lot of it and I'm happy knowing that I took away something special from each person no matter the relationship. I think he likes you and is afraid to say it. Maybe he is afraid you will reject him or worse, call him names and shun him all together. He fears probably what you fear. At worst you give him a way out. Tell him it's ok if he doesn't feel the same way but that you love him as a friend and that can be good enough for you. Let this be easy for the both of you.

Compassion should be the key here. Being vulnerable and open to pain. It can be beautiful and moving.

"d85bn8j","i'm sure you realize, but i want to be clear that i'm not excusing malpractice. I'm simply making the case that a lot of genuinely well-meaning people run the show at places like merck and pfizer. Really, that's where the majority of biomedical graduate students eventually funnel. I'm making the case that the reason that such students gravitated towards biomedical sciences (to help sick people) doesn't suddenly evaporate when they're employed in industry. 

Again, that isn't to say that some people don't make bad or intentionally morally reprehensible decisions. But instead that big pharma exists as it does because goodwill alone doesn't bring the billions of dollars required to research, develop, and manufacture thousands of literal life saving drugs. And it's important to suss out what is a cruel, but not morally reprehensible, decision (e.g. not focusing on neglected unprofitable diseases, not over-analyzing for evidence of drug harm when standards are met) versus what are cruel and wrong decisions (e.g. willfully and knowingly hiding evidence of drug harm). The issue is that the public often doesn't understand one from the other. 

When an engineer builds a bridge, for instance, he does so to standards. Sometimes bridges still fail. If he wasn't negligent in his analysis and met all industry approved standards, he wasn't being greedy by not putting in extra work. Likewise, pharma isn't negligent when they don't see any issues in their industry standard tests and decide not to go above and beyond industry standards. People believe that pharma should exist in this entirely altruistic state where workers should be happy to day after day meet every absurd standard that the public places upon them that is above and beyond what is often reasonable. Really, the daraprim situation was because the regulatory burden required to approve another generic manufacturing process was too high. In other words, we required too much safety. Could such policy have been guided by rentseeking? Sure. But the public is also culpable for unintelligently eating up the line, ""how can we put a price on safety?,"" and allowing regulations to be so burdensome.

The issue is that issues are never quite as simple as we want them to be. And neither are we as blameless as we'd like to think of ourselves as.

Then perhaps it could be a quirk of the data, rounding off here on turnout % or something.  The problem with both of these thoughts are the shear number(96k) of polling stations, and the fact that none of this choppiness is seen at any point prior to ~48%.

Even if there was a city X that had a populace of avid voters, they still turnout with some degree of variance, along with the variance in political preference.  Its the magnitude of these sudden changes, marked with increasing percent of the vote for EdRo while turnouts increase.

I can think of no reasons why these peaks are so jagged other than human manipulation, nature in terms of animals is cruel but fair.  Just look at the first third of the curve, why is it that the people voting in areas with lower turnouts vote consistently in respect to each other while the last 2/3rd its gets all wonky.  

I can think of no logical reason given the number of votes that all of a sudden once you reach a certain turnout% people start to vote one particular way and with irregularity.  I mean fervent EdRo supporters that stop voting once a turnout% is hit.  

Again, and I am just rambling at this point. it would seem a lot of stations got the memo to stuff the ballot, and some stations upped the turnout and landed on a nice even number along with adding votes to EdRo.

"d7y7sxf","I know it's hours late but here's my stab at it. I don't want to start an argument or something, just offer a justification that maybe you genuinely haven't heard before.

1) It's impossible to live on only ethically sourced materials on a limited income. Almost all our food, clothing, electronics, etc comes from exploitation of people and the environment. Ethically sourced food is significantly more expensive calorie by calorie. 

2) Being a vegan does have a positive effect on certain wrongs, but in the grand messed-up scheme of things, there is SO MUCH wrong that it's not going to do much. 

3) There are a number of other changes you could make at the cost of personal comfort to better world suffering and the environment. But honestly, the cost to your personal comfort is going to be more than anyone else is affected. Say you decided to live without electricity, and put off buying all luxuries so you could buy local or fair trade food, or put hours and hours of work into a personal garden, or avoided all phones and computers. You could do that. It would be ethical to do that. But it would suck. 

If eating meat makes you uneasy than by all means don't eat it. It DOES do good. But if you interact with modern society in any way you're already funding so much exploitation and environmental destruction that it probably doesn't matter. To some of us, taking meat out of our diet wouldn't be easy enough to justify the cost, but we'll do it in other ways, like volunteering or doing scientific research or campaigning for policy changes. 

On the animal front I don't think killing animals is wrong. Animal death is natural. I think current methods of raising animals are cruel, but same with current methods of working people to death and such, so I can't raise too big of a complaint.

"d7r0d6d","I'm seeing some confusion here, so lets clear up a few things first.

In the US, life sentences without the possibility of parole are just that. You will never walk out of the prison a free man. There's no numerical attachment to them. Occasionally the media will report someone in the US as having a life sentence if they're convicted of numerous counts such that the minimum sentence is 200 years. (For example, fake numbers, say robbing a bank has a sentence of 5-10 years, and you're convicted of 50 counts, to run consecutively. Your sentence would be 250-500 years, but the media would probably report it as a life sentence.)

Now that we know OP's premise is actually legally valid, lets look at the two considerations. Legal death, and cruel and unusual.

Legal death is the first point. How are the undead going to be treated in society. Knowing you exist, court rulings need to be made on the premise that there will be more out there. Do we want vampires able to enter into contracts? I'd say so, so unfortunately, while you may be medically dead, you won't be legally dead. Legal death will probably be redefined so as to meet the current criteria PLUS not be suffering from vamperisim.

That leaves one last option. Cruel and unusual punishment. For your sentence to be invalid it needs to meet BOTH criteria. A punishment is allowed to be unusual so long as it is not cruel, or cruel so long as it is not unusual. Your situation is, on its face, unusual. You're the only person who could be sentenced to hundreds of years of imprisonment. So it's all going to hinge on if that is considered cruel. Cruel is measured in proportion to the crime, and how it impacts society. Do you need to feed on humans? Do you need to drain them, or could you draw a small amount from volunteers/a blood bank? Assuming you're safe to release into society, it probably would be cruel, but your revised sentence may be about or even in excess of a natural person's life.

&gt;One night, when the father thinks that he and his son will starve to death, he weeps, not about the obvious but about beauty and goodness, ""things he'd no longer any way to think about"".

In creating an exquisite nightmare, it does not add to the cruelty and ugliness of our times; it warns us now how much we have to lose. It makes the novels of the contemporary Savants seem infantile and horribly over-rated. Beauty and goodness are here aplenty and we should think about them. While we can.

I think, if all you were seeing in the book is the despair and desolateness of the world, you missed out on what the book was truly about.

That will (hopefully) happen in all your future relationships, particularly at the beginning stages. That's a relationship! And that's why they're so fun! These are addictive sensations so that brings me to my second point:
That's why you feel so sad, depressed and generally shitty, right now. Because you got a taste for these lovely natural feelings and he took them away from you. It hurts. It can really hurt.
I also bet you look back on the time you spent together like a music video clip. Thinking of it in a highlight type reel. I know because I did that every time I got turned down too. What you need to remember are the moments like when he said he had a panic attack talking to his friend about being with you... Is that the kind of thing you want someone who you have deep feelings for, to say? Don't you want to meet someone who wants to spend time with you? 
I totally understand what you mean by constantly checking social media and having panic attacks when you see him, or think about it. I had them too. 
The best way of dealing with it, that I taught myself, was to get over it. Seriously. I finally one day got sick of pining over people who didn't care about me or want to be around me. I wouldnt resent them or be angry, they're certainly entitled to not want to spend the rest of their lives with me. I would just try and look at the situation as practically and pragmatically as possible. They don't want me. That's fine. Someone out there does. No point agonising anymore. 
It was making me sick. Sick with worry, anxiety and depression. And once I sort of just consciously decided to grow up, stop over romanticising things in my head and move on, I was so much more happier. 
Another piece of advice is perhaps find a new therapist. Prescribing medication over heartbreak seems incredibly excessive, also, if they haven't perhaps suggested what I already have in the time they have had you as a patient, then I don't think they're doing a very good job. Definitely shop around and try some new therapists.
I truly hope this helps. I know it sounds stupid, obvious, ineffective and cruel, but what I'm trying to show you is that once you realise you're wasting your time, potential and happiness on someone who is not willing to make you a part of their lives, then fuck em! Some one else will be lucky to have a boyfriend who is attentive, invested and madly in love.
Best of luck.

Yucti bounded through the forest. He stepped lightly over puddles and slid under logs. The tree started to thin as the ground grew rockier, and eventually he broke out of the trees onto a wide natural granite bridge, leading off and upwards to the tip of the falls. One of the other scouts was already there smoking a pipe atop a boulder. 

""Anything?""

""I've been here since dawn. We were right, there is a Cuzcuz nest in those rocks"" He pointed his pipe at a great mass of boulders slumped against the cliffs. ""Most of them are out hunting right now, but we should move past them before they return. Anything in the jungle?""

Yucti shook his head. ""Nothing larger than Crawlers. Hopefully these idiots don't start shooting again. What about *it*, the thing Jao[another scout]saw at the top?""

""He swears its the Buzzing God, but you know how he is...""

""If he is right that isn't good. If its too close to the Atiza Caw it will have awoken every living thing there, we will never be able to get within a day of it without being slaughtered."" 

""Yucti, lead the foreigners there. Their Crown is there right? Than is it too much to just leave them to their own devices past the Claws? You know as well as I we can't go into the Caw this time of year and live.""

Yucti paused for a moment, chewing on the last of the bark. ""I think we will be found out if we tried. These foreigners are cruel, but smart. They don't trust us and will suspect betrayal. They killed their own men just for running from a Yiciya, I think they would kill us for less. No-we will lead them as close to the Caw as we can and then turn back, but not at the falls. Leave some supplies here for the return journey. Leave some for the foreigners too, if any return a little food is the least we have to give them. Jaca would throw a fit if we left them to die, as much as I want to.""

""I can hear them in the distance, lets get ready then. Still, Yucti I only hope you know what you are doing. I don't want to die this far inland for some grumpy foreigners.""

The Inquisitors seem to teleport out of the trees, stepping far more softly than the convoy of soldiers behind them, smashing through the forest like a herd of mollom.

"d5wxpfa","Depends on what you are looking for.  As a whole, I'm not a huge fan of the officially released live albums for the most part.  

Is there Anybody Out There? Live 1980-1981 is a mostly faithful reproduction of the Wall album.  Delicate Sound of Thunder was the height of their needing a billion people up on stage and Rick and Nick were little more than just there to look good.  Pulse is slightly better but also features more people not in Pink Floyd than actual band members.  Both of those tours 1987-1989 and 1994 respectively, offer very little change from one night to the next and were so meticulously aligned with the lights and films that the music feels somewhat listless and the band seems to be often just going through the motions.  But that's just my opinion.  

Syd-era Floyd:  Let's Make Love in London Tonight.  While only two songs, they capture the freewheeling experimental and often chaotic nature of the early shows.  

Pre-DSOTM ""classic lineup"":  Pompeii and Ummagumma are both fun and sound great.  The BBC Sessions from 1970 &amp; 1971 have great sound quality and feature Floyd in all their extended space jam glory and Gilmour in particular is on fire.  The Man and the Journey is a wonderful sounding boot of the late 60s truly weird era.  

1972-1975 DSOTM tours: honestly, Wembley 74 is a great entry point.  Professional sound, great performance.  Boston Gardens 75 is a good Dark Side/Wish You Were Here show and 1974's Cruel but Fair is a Superb sounding bootleg.  

1977 Animals Tour:  Animal Instincts is most people's favorite (unparalleled sound quality bootleg from Anaheim on May 9th 1977).  Personally I really enjoy the 1977 Boston Gardens gig (insane long jammy version of Shine On and hands down the best versions of Wish You Were Here and Money ever played).  

1979 the Wall tour:  might as well go with Is there anybody out there for sound quality alone.  

1987-1989 Momentary Lapse tour:  Don't bother

"d5hjsww","Are you familiar with Saul Alinsky's rules? Take Rule 5 for example. Ridicule. So what do you see in the cultural marxist liberal media? Stuff like this. 
Here are the rules:

RULE 1: ""Power is not only what you have, but what the enemy thinks you have."" Power is derived from 2 main sources - money and people. ""Have-Nots"" must build power from flesh and blood. (These are two things of which there is a plentiful supply. Government and corporations always have a difficult time appealing to people, and usually do so almost exclusively with economic arguments.)

RULE 2: ""Never go outside the expertise of your people."" It results in confusion, fear and retreat. Feeling secure adds to the backbone of anyone. (Organizations under attack wonder why radicals don't address the ""real"" issues. This is why. They avoid things with which they have no knowledge.)

RULE 3: ""Whenever possible, go outside the expertise of the enemy."" Look for ways to increase insecurity, anxiety and uncertainty. (This happens all the time. Watch how many organizations under attack are blind-sided by seemingly irrelevant arguments that they are then forced to address.)

RULE 4: ""Make the enemy live up to its own book of rules."" If the rule is that every letter gets a reply, send 30,000 letters. You can kill them with this because no one can possibly obey all of their own rules. (This is a serious rule. The besieged entity's very credibility and reputation is at stake, because if activists catch it lying or not living up to its commitments, they can continue to chip away at the damage.)

RULE 5: ""Ridicule is man's most potent weapon."" There is no defense. It's irrational. It's infuriating. It also works as a key pressure point to force the enemy into concessions. (Pretty crude, rude and mean, huh? They want to create anger and fear.)

RULE 6: ""A good tactic is one your people enjoy."" They'll keep doing it without urging and come back to do more. They're doing their thing, and will even suggest better ones. (Radical activists, in this sense, are no different that any other human being. We all avoid ""un-fun"" activities, and but we revel at and enjoy the ones that work and bring results.)

RULE 7: ""A tactic that drags on too long becomes a drag."" Don't become old news. (Even radical activists get bored. So to keep them excited and involved, organizers are constantly coming up with new tactics.)

RULE 8: ""Keep the pressure on. Never let up."" Keep trying new things to keep the opposition off balance. As the opposition masters one approach, hit them from the flank with something new. (Attack, attack, attack from all sides, never giving the reeling organization a chance to rest, regroup, recover and re-strategize.)

RULE 9: ""The threat is usually more terrifying than the thing itself."" Imagination and ego can dream up many more consequences than any activist. (Perception is reality. Large organizations always prepare a worst-case scenario, something that may be furthest from the activists' minds. The upshot is that the organization will expend enormous time and energy, creating in its own collective mind the direst of conclusions. The possibilities can easily poison the mind and result in demoralization.)

RULE 10: ""If you push a negative hard enough, it will push through and become a positive."" Violence from the other side can win the public to your side because the public sympathizes with the underdog. (Unions used this tactic. Peaceful [albeit loud] demonstrations during the heyday of unions in the early to mid-20th Century incurred management's wrath, often in the form of violence that eventually brought public sympathy to their side.)

RULE 11: ""The price of a successful attack is a constructive alternative."" Never let the enemy score points because you're caught without a solution to the problem. (Old saw: If you're not part of the solution, you're part of the problem. Activist organizations have an agenda, and their strategy is to hold a place at the table, to be given a forum to wield their power. So, they have to have a compromise solution.)

"d5ggin0","The **Dreggon** are a Folklore creature in my world that are said to hail from the *Yawning Swamps*. Having a humanoid shape, they are described to be covered in hanging moss from head to toe. They are about as tall as Humans and are bulky and strong, with their faces being shrouded by their moss, though beneath, their faces are twisted and cruel, with sharp teeth and narrow eyes. They have large hands and feet, with ""Sloth"" styled claws for fingers and toes.

They're said to be vicious, deceptive, and very cruel but reclusive creatures. They look naturally repulsive and terrifying, and have a thick, repugnant, mossy and boggy smell. They seem to swim and thrive in filthy bog water when docile.

Other than their appearance, they are particularly well known for their ability to **shapeshift.** Their ability to assume the appearance or shape of most large lifeforms and objects makes them incredibly deadly. They shapeshift by pressing their hands against the object or person they wish to assume the appearance of, with the transformation usually lasting about a minute. Due to their natural mossy appearance and very flexible forms, they can also very easily camouflage themselves in thick vegetation, appearing to be nothing but clumps of moss. 

Their folklore legend is primarily that of evil body-snatchers that patrol and lurk in the Swamps, preying on those who wander too close. Legends and myths tell of the Dreggon's kidnapping travellers, dragging them off into the swamps to be never seen again. The Dreggon reportedly stash their prey in mossy, concealed caves, keeping a collection of ""cadavers"" that they can shapeshift into.

"d53ioof","On paper, I can see your point.

What they did was put the drama *outside* the ring, for a bit. See, Owen (who was in Backlund's corner) was booked as sort of obsessively anti-Bret. And suddenly, the lock is applied, Bulldog wasn't available to throw in the towel, and Bret *wouldn't give*.

So, the focus of the action now goes to Owen, who puts on this entertainingly fake display of concern for Bret, and goes over to their parents, who are sitting at ringside. Stu either wasn't there or didn't want any part of his crocodile tears (I don't recall), so Owen starts to work on their mom.

Interspersed with this, we see Bret almost escaping, but not quite managing it, and selling the hold like it's death on toast with a side of death. (You can say what you want about Bret Hart, btw, but he was an artist at selling- at one WM, he sold one injury for the entire PPV, for example).

And then, we'd cut back to Owen, pleading with his mom, arguing *he* couldn't throw in the towel for Bret, but *she* could. (Edit: I should point out that mics were a bit different then, so it was half-audible over the crowd, and half selling-it-like-a-silent-movie-actor. Fun stuff.) 

Those eight minutes actually cruised by, believe it or not. Audience expectations changed, of course, so it isn't a spotfest, but it was a good story, well told,  and the crowd was into it. 

One of the transitional bits of 'story' about Hart was that he obviously *liked* his fans, but they weren't magical Peter Pan comeback-wish machines like Hogan's Hulkamaniacs, so in this case, they cheered and he *almost* got free, and he'd try again, they'd cheer for it, and it got *that* much closer, and so on- on top of the crowd hating Owen. 

And for such a by-all-accounts great guy, Owen Hart clearly *loved* playing a despicable person, and the look on his face after he successfully conned his own mom was really a good moment. So at the end of the thing, Bret looked like a badass for not giving up (and, IIRC, they timed it so that he was getting just about free when the towel was thrown), Backlund looked like a cruel but technically unmatchable amateur and submission-style wrestler, and Owen looked like a real, grade-A *bastard*.

"d433w84","That wasn't what the situation was. There's a guy you want dead *mid-combat*. And so you ignore the closest immediate threat, who is assuredly going to stab at you next turn, in order to make it happen. Remember, this isn't Crown of Madness, where you deny a player their action while killing off their ally. You are actively emptying your clip into the corpse, while everyone else is still in the firefight. It's a petty move, a desperate move, or even an accidental move, but from a character perspective, it isn't a smart move to use your weakest damaging spell on an unconscious person to assure they died *without* meta gaming, which kind of precludes it from being the smart move.

First of all, there's a difference between Tucker's Kobolds and regular ones. They're much more malicious. Much less defensive. So it's kind of weird that you told me my own kobolds' motivation, but super wrong when you consider the source material. Once you've transgressed enough to encounter TK, they aren't going to just let you alone.

Secondly, the body doesn't have to move. There's a max range for healing spells, and it isn't greater than that of a ranged weapon. So it forces the healer to be only so far away (vulnerable to attack from location A, B, or C)

And if he uses a ranged heal, the downed PC can quickly be cut down again, since ranged heals are just weaker. Turn them into a pincushion whenever they move, but the longer they keep a pulse the less likely the Cleric is to wander very far. 

I'm not saying that players can't get back into combat if left alive, but that planning for a Cleric, and working around him feels like you're fighting the players, not their characters. Most groups of rabble and bandits aren't going to come across a powerful cleric more than once in their lives. If ever. It's not an every day occurrence for most NPCs to deal with healing magic. It exists, but it's not your first thought. It makes sense to change your plans once healing magic DOES show up. But it also makes the most sense, as a bandit who saw a guy heal another guy is to say ""Oh shit, get him!"" And hit the *one doing the healing* since that's clearly the problem here, since this is much tougher battle than every other battle I, as an NPC, have experienced. 

Remember, this is all about MM. Coup de Gras, ranged attacks, all that stuff? Maybe a bit metagamey, maybe a bit cruel, but more acceptable.

But Magic Missile? I can't grok a way to perceive of the spell *in universe* as the logical choice considering it has two main qualities: it ALWAYS hits (makes a great chaser spell, but who needs to aim at the immobile target. Consider their Dex saves are autofails. You don't have to try to hit then.) and it hits like a series of hits from a pillow (lowest individual damage rolls for any spell).

When you take the spell at its face value, look at it from an NPCs perspective... It shouldn't be the spell you choose. If you only have MM as a damaging 1st level spell, and you're almost out magic? Sure. But if you have any other option, and your goal is PC death, it's the worst RP decision to pick the best mechanical decision. 

It's just metagame cheese to use that spell specifically in that manner. ",1465522582,"maybe a bit metagamey, maybe a bit cruel, but more acceptable.","cruel, but more","cruel","but",TRUE,"cruel , but more acceptable","acceptable",NA,"more",1

"d3vx455","You are correct. That is why I sourced it all.    

But the left has been taught to not accept sources and historical facts.  It is part of the play book. Yes an actual book that you guys follow.

&gt; RULE 1: “Power is not only what you have, but what the enemy thinks you have.” Power is derived from 2 main sources – money and people. “Have-Nots” must build power from flesh and blood. (These are two things of which there is a plentiful supply. Government and corporations always have a difficult time appealing to people, and usually do so almost exclusively with economic arguments.)
* RULE 2: “Never go outside the expertise of your people.” It results in confusion, fear and retreat. Feeling secure adds to the backbone of anyone. (Organizations under attack wonder why radicals don’t address the “real” issues. This is why. They avoid things with which they have no knowledge.)
* RULE 3: “Whenever possible, go outside the expertise of the enemy.” Look for ways to increase insecurity, anxiety and uncertainty. (This happens all the time. Watch how many organizations under attack are blind-sided by seemingly irrelevant arguments that they are then forced to address.)
* RULE 4: “Make the enemy live up to its own book of rules.” If the rule is that every letter gets a reply, send 30,000 letters. You can kill them with this because no one can possibly obey all of their own rules. (This is a serious rule. The besieged entity’s very credibility and reputation is at stake, because if activists catch it lying or not living up to its commitments, they can continue to chip away at the damage.)
* RULE 5: “Ridicule is man’s most potent weapon.” There is no defense. It’s irrational. It’s infuriating. It also works as a key pressure point to force the enemy into concessions. (Pretty crude, rude and mean, huh? They want to create anger and fear.)
* RULE 6: “A good tactic is one your people enjoy.” They’ll keep doing it without urging and come back to do more. They’re doing their thing, and will even suggest better ones. (Radical activists, in this sense, are no different that any other human being. We all avoid “un-fun” activities, and but we revel at and enjoy the ones that work and bring results.)
* RULE 7: “A tactic that drags on too long becomes a drag.” Don’t become old news. (Even radical activists get bored. So to keep them excited and involved, organizers are constantly coming up with new tactics.)
* RULE 8: “Keep the pressure on. Never let up.” Keep trying new things to keep the opposition off balance. As the opposition masters one approach, hit them from the flank with something new. (Attack, attack, attack from all sides, never giving the reeling organization a chance to rest, regroup, recover and re-strategize.)
* RULE 9: “The threat is usually more terrifying than the thing itself.” Imagination and ego can dream up many more consequences than any activist. (Perception is reality. Large organizations always prepare a worst-case scenario, something that may be furthest from the activists’ minds. The upshot is that the organization will expend enormous time and energy, creating in its own collective mind the direst of conclusions. The possibilities can easily poison the mind and result in demoralization.)
* RULE 10: “If you push a negative hard enough, it will push through and become a positive.” Violence from the other side can win the public to your side because the public sympathizes with the underdog. (Unions used this tactic. Peaceful [albeit loud] demonstrations during the heyday of unions in the early to mid-20th Century incurred management’s wrath, often in the form of violence that eventually brought public sympathy to their side.)
* RULE 11: “The price of a successful attack is a constructive alternative.” Never let the enemy score points because you’re caught without a solution to the problem. (Old saw: If you’re not part of the solution, you’re part of the problem. Activist organizations have an agenda, and their strategy is to hold a place at the table, to be given a forum to wield their power. So, they have to have a compromise solution.)
* RULE 12: Pick the target, freeze it, personalize it, and polarize it.” Cut off the support network and isolate the target from sympathy. Go after people and not institutions; people hurt faster than institutions. (This is cruel, but very effective. Direct, personalized criticism and ridicule works.)

A year ago, his female nephew and female cousin both died in such a small period of time... And both of his older brother and sister are adults, and they're living on their own, he misses them...

As his friends, we tried to tell him that hate wasn't the answer, and that he needed help to be healed but, he refused, and a friend said that he acted in a very arrogant manner, reason because their friendship is now broken beyond repair.

He acted really rashly, using bad words and his behavior was really hypocritical, also he really likes to hold on grudges, and most of the time he always thinks that he's right.

If you do something to him, he'll probably remember it forever, that's how he is, sadly. u_u

He knows that he have pain, and he said once: ""No one in this stupid planet can give me what I truly want"" he never said the thing that he truly desires so, it's quite difficult to understand him...

Deleted him from facebook because he was just too rude and cruel, but said that I'll add him back when he changed, sadly, I think that he'll never be the same anymore...

He doesn't believe in psychologists/psychiatrists, he doesn't want his parents to know the story, and he closes himself in a shell of hate and darkness, saying once that: ""My father was right, true friends doesn't exist"", I told him: ""They do, but you never treated them like they deserved to, you just unleashed your anger and frustration on them; and that's no friendship"".

I was in a similar situation to him a few years ago, but when I told my mother, the problems started to drift away, and the only remain was some anxiety issues... But he has been through even more suffering...

Yet, he refuses to realize that some of the things that happened to him was because of his attitude, because he doesn't want help, thinking that he doesn't deserve to take away the time of his parents.

No matter what you do, people will focus on the bad things you've done to them, not the good ones... It is true, because all of us have felt, and will still fell that in the future, someday, hatred and grudges...

It's hard to avoid that path, regrets are the main triggers for certain people, and the wish to became a better person can erase them but, for others, it's their hatred that keeps them moving on this world...

How can you understand someone who doesn't want to get helped and only retaliate with coldness and hatred? :(

"d3huvtr","&gt; if she is trying to be like Mari, and not just learn from her but actually turn into her.

No no, you said Kate idolises Mari. Show me one panel where she does this. There have been lots of panels in both present and past where girls are admiring and idolising Mari and the USC. If you say Kate does this too then you need to prove it. Recognising that someone has great traits is not the same as idolising or admiring them.

&gt;there happened an event where Kate took Mari from school

Kate fetched Mari during a school trip because she had wondered off, this was her job as a class rep apparantly. When she offered the snack it could be seen as reaching out to Mari but in the end it was meaningless, wether Mari had accepted or not would have no bearing on Kate bullying Meiko and Mari standing up to her or Mari continueing to take ""everything"" from Kate, which is where her hate stems from, not the refusing of a snack or some unseen, never mentionned other attempts at reaching out.

As for the inferiority complex, I went back and checked and Kate does call herself uncultured and cruel but I never said that Kate doesn't feel inferior to Mari. All I said is that she seems to have a complex about her breasts, as well as her body which she calls shabby and bony, and you can determine this from that scene. An inferiority complex is about self-doubt and feelings of not measuring up to standards. This isn't Kate, she is always presented as confident and above average. At most you could say she has a Mari-complex which along with her apparant need to be the popular girl developped into her obsession with being Mari.

&gt;I would like them to actually 'resolve' this issue in present time rather than let time do the job for them. 

Well that just isn't really possible. They could part on good terms but would need to let the wounds heal for some time in any case. These 2 are blackmailing eachother right now and trust is very important to all human relations.

"d3336fe","I think the thing we have to accept about the BDM/Randy situation is that despite how hurtful that thread must have been, and how unfair some of the criticsms were, what was on display in that thread was the best estimation we have of voice of the non-kitchen table player base. If we care about serving this player base then we must put our feelings aside and engage every coherent idea/opinion we can possibly extract from the conversation. I say this with apologies to BDM and Randy who seem like great people, but whose consistently lacklustre commentary has been the most visible problem with magic coverage.

Reddit is, for better or worse, a largely unfiltered view into the opinions of the majority and I wish we could just be pragmatic about it instead of wringing our hands constantly over the fact that an anonymous collection of opinions doesn't behave like a social group. It's a failure of our monkey brains that we interact with a non-corporeal blob of millions of opinions and feel hurt or disrespected when it doesn't conduct itself with the slick PR we're used to from flesh and blood humans in our daily lives.

The dilemma of reddit (and this can be largely applied to the internet as a whole) is the conflict between how obviously useful it is to be in touch with the aggregate voice of the people, and how utterly unprepared we are, emotionally, for dealing with unfiltered opinions. So with reddit we have this incredibly useful tool at our disposal but its continued use seems to exact a toll on our psychological well-being. 

I think almost all of us have felt burned by reddit at some point, and it's very tempting to tell ourselves feel-good stories to mitigate the emotional impact. Stories like how reddit doesn't actually reflect the public, but rather it's a collection of terrible vicious people, or that some dark force has perverted whichever subreddit we're on, transforming all the people who would have agreed with us and loved us into vindictive trolls whose only purpose is to brutalize us ... whatever. Let's admit that this is narcissistic nonsense that we're incentivized to concoct in order to dismiss opinions we don't like. Reddit is people and people are mean, callous, and cruel, but they're also smart, and sometimes they're correct. And if we're concerned with doing what's best for everyone, we have to take everything into account, not just what we can bear to read. 

Reddit (MagicTCG) is an incredibly useful tool for all of us and we should guard against the temptation to neuter or destroy it to serve our egos. Certainly there are ways to moderate reddit, to prune some of the sharp edges, but we have to understand what we are potentially giving up when we go too far down the road of ""Reddit is shit, I don't have to listen to any of that bullshit.

Bingo. This should be enough to convenience yourself it may be time to take up arms and carry daily. Again it is not a decision that can be done over night and I would certainly involve the wife and get her opinion on it. If she is hesitant make sure you fully understand where she is coming from. If she agrees then ask her if she feels the same way and is she would want to take this journey with you! Its much easier and certainly much more comforting if both parties are involved! I know the day my wife decided to carry it took a lot of weight off my shoulders knowing she also had my 6!

&gt;I've got a a Ruger 10/22 at home as well as a Chiappa Rhino 40DS, and have had a Glock 17 in the past.

Good! Then you are already past the first few steps. Having them for sport vs self defense will play a diffrent role in terms of both handling and mindset. Do you have any local ranges that allow you to rent handguns? The P938 is a great choice but it does shoot different than all the mentioned handguns. Try out the Shields, XDM, XD-S, Glocks all of the modern striker fired handguns along with the Sig SA and some DA and see which you shoot the best. In the end regardless of style and price the gun you should carry is the handgun you can shoot best. Concealment and comfort go hand and hand with that as well. With the flood in the market of holsters now days there is generally one out there that will allow for you to be able to comfortably carry just about anything. **Remember what may work for me and others, may not work for you**. You will have to do the research and what will end up in trail and error along with a drawer full of holsters but in the end you will find something that works for you! 

Of course if you do decide to take up arms training will be key and cruel! But from what I have gathered you already understand that and when that time comes around we can expect a new post with some training questions. Actual self defense training is always recommended outside of any required training.

It definitely sounds like you are headed in the right direction and you certainly have the reason to want to carry giving your situations.

"d2gyo1w","#THE WALL WILL BE AS GOOD FOR MEXICANS AS IT IS FOR US


I'll explain. The Mexican government is essentially the political and diplomatic arm of the Mexican drug cartels. The drug cartels have no interest in developing Mexico's economy or infrastructure. 


America's open borders helps the Mexican government in multiple ways. 


Mexico's lowlifes, rapists, criminals and drug addicts use the open border and underground illegal immigrant network in America to ditch Mexico. This absolves Mexico from having to police or incarcerate most of their own criminals.


The hardest working, most capable, and most motivated Mexicans are happy to escape their shithole of a country for far better work in the US. American businesses like these people here because they can be paid wages equivalent to slave labor, but from the Mexican's position, it's GREAT money and much of it is sent back to Mexico. Of course, the Mexican cartel/government takes some of that transferred money when it gets back.  So, the Mexican government gets to collect taxes on money which came at ZERO cost to them! They didn't have to legitimize their markets, they didn't have to build their economy, they didn't need to do shit. They just forcefully collect the cash. 


What's happening macroeconomically here though, is tragic.  Think about the good, hard-working Mexican immigrants; Who is their American socioeconomic equivalent? The good Mexicans here paid slave labor wages SHOULD be the Mexican middle class. Not only are American elites cannibalizing their own nation's working class, their robbing Mexico of it's working class for the sake of marginal profit.  


What the Mexican people need is this: A TALL WALL constructed and mass deportations back home. I know many Mexicans in America won't like it, and it'll be decried as awful and cruel, but the Mexican government needs to suffer the wrath of their own angry and desperate middle class. If THE WALL can begin choking off cartel profits, then even better. The Mexicans we so compassionately use as slave labor need to be forced back home to build their own country and REVOLT if their government tries to stop their efforts.  I know they're not stupid or lazy. We're not talking about inbred Muslims here. 


We need to be out of nation building, but I'm perfectly fine donating money to free-market Mexican Nationalists who want to develop their own country (none of that ""we're taking Texas and Arizona as Mexican colonies"" shit that Soros funds). 


Mexicans in the US are kind of like a good friend crashing in your basement to avoid dealing with a conflict at home.

"d1wwnys","The Boltons, from A Song of Ice and Fire (Game of Thrones, for the layman). The two characters in question, Roose and his bastard son Ramsay, can't really be separated from each other when discussing terrifying villainy, despite them doing villainous actions in polar opposite fashions.

Ramsay is a deranged sociopath: he's quick to violence, impulsive and cruel, but he has a low cunning that he uses to terrifying effect - he's very good at getting dropped into a situation and figuring things out and winning out against the good guys. However, he viciously rapes, kills and worse of all in his case, physically and psychologically tortures everyone he can do any combination of those two and get away with. When he takes prisoners, he tortures and mutilates them, and stages false escapes for them with other ""prisoners"" (really his henchmen), leading them to distrust and violently resist anybody who tries to help them, sincere or not, causing them to have a horrifying 'loyalty' to him.

Roose, on the other hand, doesn't seem like that bad a guy on the surface. He's polite, respectful and extremely intelligent, but creepy as fuck. He speaks in a quiet, barely audible whisper, and it's said (and shown) of him that he enjoys playing with people more than anything else, and that means anyone - he is a massive, sadistic troll, for lack of a better word. He has regularly raped women throughout his lands, and summarizes one day as ""the fox I was hunting died, my favorite horse had to be put down, and raping that woman wasn't really that great"".

"d1vkpey","&gt;Higher intelligence does not always mean higher compassion. In fact, in my experience, higher intelligence usually results in less compassion and more objective thinking, even when involving living things...

Compassion is a social instinct and aliens need not be social organisms at all anyways. Any correlations you find are limited to human neurogenetic trends and ""social intelligent tool-users"" more generally because we can expect them to have similar instincts/social pressures/selection pressures.

If they aren't social, they'd *almost certainly* have zero compassion except to offspring and if they're asexual and die during reproduction like some animals you'd expect zero compassion at all. I mean, you wouldn't expect humans to instinctively fear high pitch noises like the prey of a bat would you? No. Because we have no evolutionary need to.

Note, in english this has the connotation of meaning they're cruel - but if they aren't social they probably don't have some of the mob-anger instincts we have and might act very reasonable because they conceptually understand that things like ""trading"" are beneficial to it and that attacking the other organism would interfere with its own ends by perhaps triggering retaliation.

Imagine if there's an alien that sees earth and has no compassion. It might go ""ah hah! these people will be my slaves and mine/build stuff for me! excellent! Yet, I don't want to expend the effort of achieving complete control over them, so I will leave these slaves alone until they get to the point where they do what I want all on their own and then exchange items I don't need for ones I do need! Zero effort slavery!"" Essentially, they may not have compassion but that doesn't mean they are evil/cruel because the truth is that being evil and cruel involve expending effort. If it has some overwriting goal like a poorly made dumb-AI could *and* zero compassion *and* we are in the way, *that* could get bad. However, you would expect most intelligent organisms to have evolved selfishness, fear, pain, and some limited laziness/greediness that keeps them from expending resources on pointless shit.

Intelligence isn't essential for that matter... The only requirement is that they *evolve the ability to cross interstellar space* and I can think of ways they could do that without being *social intelligent tool-users that evolved the ability to create tools that let them cross interstellar space*.

"d1phx59","My question was mostly rhetorical. :) As a minority, I'm aware how we're treated in this country. I just have trouble wrapping my brain around the fact that an armed group of civilians is allowed to organize in public like this. Yeah, I know... 'Murica, freedum, guns! or whatever, but it scares me - especially when it's coupled with misguided self-righteousness. That's an entirely different issue though.

The way Muslims are currently viewed in the US is closer to how the Japanese were during WW2 than the racism and homophobia black and gay Americans faced in the past (and still face today). People are afraid. For many Americans, their only knowledge of Islam comes from politicians and the mainstream media - two groups that have done all they can to fuel the flames of fear and hatred since 9/11. They hear ""Shari'ah"" over and over again, and to them it's a spooky word that means cutting off hands and executing non-Muslims, because that's how it's been used in our media. I think a lot of them genuinely believe all Muslims hate them, and want to ""destroy"" America and Christianity, and they're scared.

If the Muslims here had a violent uprising similar to the ones you mentioned, I'm worried it wouldn't have the same result at all. Just like black Americans are easily labeled and disregarded as ""thugs"", Muslims will be labeled and disregarded as ""terrorists."" Perhaps I'm too idealistic, but I feel like the only real solution is education. Some people are just hateful and cruel, but for many their prejudices are simply a result of ignorance. I believe that if more Americans understood Islam, or personally got to know some Muslims, a lot of this current tension could be alleviated.

"d14p4w3","The piltover officers stepped in carefully, wary of the traps that Jinx often left in her hideouts. Vi waited for Blitzcrank to finish his scan, “ALL CLEAR, NO THREATS DETECTED”. Given Blitzcrank's go ahead, the officers explored Jinx's haunt, one of the officers shouted when he discovered one of Jinx's stockpiles, and they quickly got to work. The other officers started to bag the many weapons, eager to confiscate some of the mad girls weapons before they could be used on Piltover citizens. Vi left them, and continued exploring the base.

The door had Jinx's tell tale pink handwriting emblazoned on the wood. “Mommy's Toy Room”, Vi just rolled her eyes, “Jesus, more guns? Where does she find them”. She reached for the handle expecting to find row after row of explosives, but as the door opened, the smell rushed out of the room. Vi's eyes widened in shock at what she saw, instead of a room full of explosives, she saw a sex toys strewn across the floor, dried jizz caked the floor. She quickly plugged her nose before stepping in, the smell being too much for Vi to handle.

The poor figure sat huddled in the corner, shying away from the light. Vi approached the prisoner, “Hey, it's ok, you're safe now”. Up closer, Vi could see everything, his hair was dyed pink, and absolutely coated with spunk. It was tied in thick bobtails, and his face was lazily coated with makeup, lipstick smudged on his face messily. He was completely naked, and tattoos coated his body, cumslut, whore, fucksleeve, the list went on. Worst was the collar, marking him as Jinx's property. “My god, you poor man” She tried to comfort him, but the man nestled close, pushing his head to her groin submissivly. “what the” she tried to push him away, but he was insistent, “Hungry, Mistress has been gone, so hungry, please.” He kept clawing at her crotch, “Where is it, why don’t you have one like mistress?” Vi shook her head, it was too late, he was too far broken. She knew Jinx was insane and cruel, but this was a whole new level.
 
Vi was so lost in shock, trying to fathom what the poor man had been through, only to be brought to reality as blitzcrank slammed open the door. “DANGER, SHE IS BA-zcssr”. Vi turned, and saw Jinx standing over Blitz's body, before taking a gunshot to the thigh. “I don't like you guys poking your noses round my house” Jinx smiled at the prisoner, “Now heel pet, give Mommy a proper greeting” Vi tried to stem her wound, and watched in disgust as the broken man eagerly shuffled forward, crawling to Jinx eagerly.

Her vision wavered, clutching her wound as gunfire erupted around her. Brief bouts of darkness hit her, and each time she came to, she could see Jinx unleashing gunfire on her officers, while the poor figure nestled himself between her thighs. Finally, the gunfire stopped, and left just Vi's desperate breathing and the sloppy sounds of oral sex as the slave worshipped Jinx's package. Jinx dropped the gun, and Vi groaned, all of her squad was either dead or scared away, it was just her and the mad gun now.

Vi just watched, unable to stand and fight, and was forced to look as the broken slut suckled on Jinx's balls. “He's a good pet don't you think?” Vi just nodded, unwilling to expend more of her rapidly draining energy. “He wasn't always like this, he just needed a firm hand” She gently lifted her slaves chin, locking his eyes with hers, and pushed her lips together, kissing the air. He knew the signal, and like a well trained pet, let her lathered balls fall free, and crawled behind her. He grabbed her cheeks and pried them apart, giving him clear view of her puckered asshole. He dived in, knowing better then to disobey, and the faster he pleased mistress, the faster he would be fed.

Vi just watched with abject disgust, the awful sounds of slurping and licking reverberated from Jinx's behind. “Don't worry though, He's a good pet, but he is willing to share, aren’t you Mr Tibbles.” A muffled mhmm came from behind Jinx, “That doesnt mean stop honey.....” The slut understood, and quickly went back to exploring Jinx's swampy brown rose. “I think I can take you in too Ham Hands.....” She grabbed her heavy sack, brandishing it to the wounded Vi, “I've got enough in here for the both of you” With that final statement, Vi succumbed to unconsciouness.

"d05uhuh","Yeah! Supernatural is the longest-running Sci-fi/ Fantasy series but sometimes it feels that has fallen prey to that longevity. 

Fans say that it has gone hillside since season 5 and that Seasons 1-5 were the best. Well I think when they mean 1-5 they mean 4 and 5 to be exact and they find it difficult to see a series that has become less equal to what it has been in the past. Of course it's understandable that it is damn near impossible to find a story that can surpass the apocalypse and it is difficult to love something although how good it might be when ya have seen its epic ending right?
 According to wikipedia the first couple seasons were not that good that people may seem to believe and in it own words:(Swindoll also liked the third season, saying ""Eric Kripke must've sold his soul to the devil so that the show wouldn't suffer a third season slump."" ).

However people ignore that in unison to what SPN has brought to them from 3 to 5 at the same time they say that seasons like 6,8 and 9 are not good and that SPN has become boring as nothing ever happens just coz there is no season that can top season 5 to be exact! 
Anyway, I only asked that question to know what ya think about that issue because to be honest I openly admit that I sometimes hate MWE and I think of them as fillers! 

I am just surprised that some people say that seasons like season 9 sucked while I see it one of the best since season 5 except for some crappy fillers and the sucking Bloodline. It had 2 strong story-line however the holes it contained, Sam getting possessed by an angle, Dean becoming a demon, Castiel becoming human and Crowley becoming a blood junkie! At this point I have to admit that killing Abaddon was rushedbut Metatron was pretty intelligent near the season's end as he convinced cass to lead the angles only to take to make the turn on him by a brilliant twist. It held the strongest story-line since season 5 ad of course it could have been better but I think it was very good though! oh did I mention that its viewership was more than most seasons including 5?! 

Season 8 was a relief in my opinion after the crap of season 7 and it was very promising at first but then its ending was aimless as they didn't close the gates of hell but it was pretty new experience to have a vamp friend and it was a pretty good season too except few episodes. 

Season 6 showed us the monster mythology and that ya shouldn't mess up things that God put in order. It was good to see cass dark side although I didn't like the season at first but as the story progressed it became very very good. It held excellent episodes like the french mistake and weekend at Boobby's......... 

To be honest I didn't like season 7 at all and season 10 felt so stretched ending every episode with Sam asking dean if he is alright with the solution coming in the season's last minutes and Charlie's cruel but yet priceless death.

"cz8pj4q","&gt; *a collection of hobbies and knowledge was a selfish indulgence.*

It can be, and so be it.  We are selfish monkeys, always to some degree, and need to be honest with that cold hard fact if we have any chance of keeping it in balance with more generous aspects of our nature.  As a collector of knowledge, I recognize the selfish aspect as a necessary motivator.  I could not do all this purely for others, there is ultimately a self indulgent, masturbatory aspect to it.  There is nothing wrong with wanking, but it is honorable to share our knowledge.

&gt; *in a way that impacted those around me.*

I do think we should try to impact those around us.  Share the knowledge.  If there is anything special about our species, it is our learning ability, and not our sharp claws or fangs, nor our fast legs, nor any other biological evolutionary scheme.  We are dealers in knowledge, it has evolved into our central business.  And so I say that as we refine our knowledge through the ages, each of us should try to propagate what we learn.

&gt; *I guess I still struggle to think it's valuable in comparison to people that cannot afford such hobbies because all of their time is dedicated solely to helping others.*

Let this not be a matter of either selfish indulgence OR helping, let it be BOTH.  Let your luxurious wealth to explore rare places be not wasted.  We humans are here to explore and develop the amazing details and possibilities whenever we can.  Without this we would be boring and poor.  With this variety, this opulence, this often fetishistic indulgence, we also find the fine points that drive total progress.  We have to try to explore everything possible, if we hope to reveal all the combinations that actually mattered.  I deeply applaud those who can dedicate themselves to the most basic struggles, this world contains a grand struggle of starving people clawing against a natural world that is often harsh and cruel.  But at the same time, the tiniest, least expected bit of knowledge can wipe away more struggle than all the physical effort in the world.  Washing hands for surgery is one precious example, that did more with something learned to improve our struggle than what we had done in millions of years before.  We cannot predict where the next important thing comes from, and those precious things are countless.  Learn whatever you can, however and wherever you can, and do whatever you can to share it.

"cz0sirk","I don't know if I'd agree to such a narrow definition of body horror. I rather like the one [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_horror) has in place. eXistenZ is great for this, even though it doesn't really feature transformations (save perhaps in levels of mental stability and clarity).

That said, the transformation angle is a *very* strong way to execute body horror. The Fly, The Thing, Alien, and Slither are all very potent examples, and these films and others like them inspired me to come up with a tabletop RPG campaign centered around mutation and transformation. I thought it would have been very interesting to have people taken from normal hospital stays and turned into test subjects. They'd break out and slowly, over time, discover the effects of what had been done to them as they lost their humanity. While the player characters would develop new abilities based off of their mutations, this isn't some X-Men shit. Horrible growths and discharges, sick cravings and twisted new ways of thinking that they just can't stop, disgusting levels of chimerism with who-knows-what (one of my potential players wanted to be ""the Roach Queen"", who would form these smelly egg sacs in her skin and... well, you get the idea), general defiance of normal biology and anatomy, the usual loss of things like teeth, skin, hair, nails, etc. It was intended to be sort of a trope-flip kind of thing, where the players are the horrific monsters and the villains are... normal.

"cz0jofy","Prospective engineer here, I'll give the detailed run down why this is not feasible. First off, it doesn't make sense from a cost benefit analysis, from both mechanical, economic and operational reasons.

Mechanical: The simple rule with any engineered product is ""the more parts it has, the more parts that can fail catastrophically"". Airplanes are enormously complex machines, and are designed to undergo enormous stresses and remain in one piece. Pressure vessels are extremely hard to build, and the easiest way to compromise the structural integrity of a pressure vessel is to *cut holes in it*. I see a big hole in this design. When it comes to the cost benefit analysis, this kind of design is more likely to cause fatalities over the course of its operational lifetime. There is a greater chance that it will fail catastrophically that it being used to save lives, because air transport is already extremely safe (see next section for explanation). We can look at the expected fatalities through a mathematical expression.

Let's say that the airplane carries 150 people. We will use the variables a, which represents the chance the system will be used to save lives, and b, which is the chance that it will fail catastrophically and kill everyone:

Net lives = (a*150) - (b*150)

However, we have previously established that the system is more likely to break and fail catastrophically. Therefore we can conclude that a &lt; b, which then allows us to rearrange the equation:

(a*150) - (b*150) = (a - b)*150
 
and 

(a - b) &lt; 0

therefore

(a - b)*150 &lt; 0

therefore

Net lives &lt; 0

Therefore, over the projected life cycle of the system, it will cause a net loss of life.

Economic: Airlines are massive billion dollar organizations that fight to the death to shave off every penny of savings. The fact of the matter is cruel but simple. Since the chance of a crash is so low, lets say 1 out of a million (10e6), it is actually cheaper to let one crash happen, deal with the bad PR and pay the insurance fees than retrofit aircraft with additional safety features. Lets say that an aircraft crash costs 100 million dollars, and to retrofit it with a safety system costs 20 million dollars.

(10e-6)*(10e8) = 10e2 = 100 dollars expected losses per lifetime

vs

2*10e7 dollar upfront.

Therfore, it is cheaper to let crashes happen based on expected value calculations.

Operational: The real fact of the matter here is that this system, even if it worked and was cost effective, would not actually have saved lives in the last major mass casualty aviation incidents. Commercial airliners are already ridiculously safe, due to smart nerds working at aerospace manufacturers and decades of trial and error. A growing trend is showing that mass casualty aviation incidents are increasingly being caused by human action, through a combination of pathetically poor airmanship and straight up malice.

Why PMO sucks in relationship from my experience: 

PMO sucks in relationship because you can't connect emotionally with your SO. You can't be motivated proactive, you can't make decisions. PMO makes you weak, so you can't do anything for your woman, you just keep saying stuff. PMO makes it impossible to empathise with your SO, so you can't appreciette her. If you PMO you will never learn to understand women.

-----------------------

I don't wont to sound cruel, but most of the first relationships ends terribly. I am 28 and not a single one relationship I saw lasted.

First relationships are always difficult, your mind is clouded, the emotions when you get so close to someone are just overwhelming. No one has knowledge and experience how to handle those emotions. Thats why people have multiple relationships during their lives, you actually need to fuck it up at least once so you can get it right in the end.


And don't blame PMO so much there was a reason why you kept masturbating in relationship. We are not mindless animals, PMO is trigerred by mental problems not sexy images.

"cyn2kgz","Of course. You and I have discussed this many times, even recently. Remember: abortion? stem cells? Nazi Germany?

I believe that morality is a way of judging actions based on how they align with God's nature—the moral objective. ""Well being"" is a moveable target, too easily susceptible to the whims of the powers that be or the current cultural mores, and not a reliable standard by which to judge actions. With the nebulous ""well being"" as a standard, man's cruelty can be deftly justified as nobility. Nazi Germany is the chef d'oeuvre of that storyline. The reasoning goes far behind our conversation, however.

If we accept an impersonal beginning for humanity (evolutionary naturalism), morals don't exist as morals. We are just the chance result of mass, energy, and motion—all impersonal. With an impersonal beginning, morals is just another form of metaphysics—of being. We are left to talk about only what is antisocial (detrimental to human well-being), or what society doesn't like (contrary to human well-being), or even what I don't like (morals is in the eye of the beholder), but we can't talk about what is really right or really wrong. If there is an impersonal beginning, we are only what we are by chance, and morals are a social construct of survival. In addition, if cruelty is part of our animal nature, and well-being is only a social construct for survival, there is no hope for a solution. Plato, Sartre, Nietzsche, Camus, J.L. Mackie, Joel Marks, and William Provine were all right: unless you have absolutes, morals do not exist. There is no real basis for fighting evil except that in the long run it may help us survive our meaningless existence for a longer time. But we are still ultimately subject to blind physical forces: some people are going get hurt just as some are going to get lucky, and there is no rhyme or reason in it, nor any injustice. There is no design, no purpose, no evil, and no good. Just, as Dawkins says, nothing but blind, pitiless indifference.

But if humans have a personal beginning (theism), morals and metaphysics separate, meaning that right and wrong have true definitions, and cruelty cannot be passed off as noble. There is an objective moral standard defining right and wrong. Therefore, there is an honest ground for fighting evil, including social evil and social injustice. God didn't make things as they are now; he didn't make man cruel, but good. Humans made a mess, and it can be undone. Humans can be remade in the image of God who is acting to redeem them from their cruelty. There is a solution to the problem of man. We can have real morals and moral absolutes, for now God is absolutely good. 

In an interview, Richard Dawkins was queried about the foundation of ethical values. Dawkins claims that all sense of value judgments are the result of the evolutionary process.

Interviewer: So therefore ""good"" is just as random in a sense as any product of evolution? Ultimately, your belief that rape is wrong is as arbitrary as the fact that we’ve evolved five fingers rather than six.

Dawkins: You could say that, yeah.

Hm. The Nazis ruled to impose their morality of human wellbeing in a social evolutionary environment. The only way to challenge the Nazi ideal is to establish that there is a higher moral authority than human well-being, i.e., that there are transcendent grounds for morality and justice. Atheist Richard Rorty claims that humanity creates its own values and ideas and is not accountable to any external objectivity (theism) or internal subjectivity (conscience). But if Rorty is right, there is no ground for opposing Nazism. Morals are defined by the reigning power group. Instead, morals are only morals if defined by a universal objective.

You see, in your question (""So would you agree that we should follow laws if doing so is likely to improve human well being in general, and discard laws that appear to be a detriment to human well being?""), who gets to define ""human well being""? Do the scientists, who want the chance to experiment and see what is possible? Do the people, who are generally motivated to decide what is in their self-interests? Does the government, whose concern is power? Does business, whose goal is a larger profit? ""Human well-being"" is a moving target; it's a foundation of sand.

Remember?


1. You cannot have morality with an objective standard. Without an objective standard, it's not definable and not meaningful.
2. You can't have values just from time plus matter plus chance. All values from an impersonal, chemical and physical sources are arbitrary and contrived.

The ATO video that came out a) never should have been seen by anyone, ever, and b) is the most bizarre form of hazing I have ever personally heard of. It's not ""porn"" so much as just some fucked up, ""Hey bro -- go down on that stripper dude!"" kind of deal.

Hazing in fraternities &amp; sororities is meant to build a bond between members of a pledge class. When you go through miserable experiences with a select group of people, *in my opinion* (key phrase) it brings you much closer to the people that go through it with you.

In the early days, hazing was done properly. In the 80s and 90s, things started to go overboard; today, there are still a lot of ridiculous incidents where whoever was in charge made horrible, horrible decisions that only an idiot could make. If you're going to hold a (*ahem*) pledge team building exercise, you make damn sure that nobody in that fucking room has a cell phone.

In terms of the benefits of membership to a Greek Life organization, while it's true that it's often easier to find a job because of the networking, the real benefit is... well, networking. You've got a group of people who are inherently loyal to one another because of the shared experiences. Those experiences are not meant to be shared, verbally or otherwise, with anybody else, ever. So, you look at the guys (or girls) around you who you went through it with, and you can smile and wink at sharing a common knowledge of what it took to be a part of said organization.

Off the top, to people who are not involved, hazing seems unnecessary and cruel. But pledging a fraternity or a sorority is meant to be akin to joining the military -- you get broken down before you're built back up. You learn to lose any attitude or sense of self-righteousness in learning that you're no better than the guy (or girl) standing next to you, that you work as a unit, and that groups of people working to achieve a common goal are much better off than an individual working on his or her own.",1444395436,"off the top, to people who are not involved, hazing seems unnecessary and cruel.","unnecessary and cruel","cruel",NA,FALSE,"unnecessary and cruel","unnecessary",NA,NA,0

The governor sits on a sturdy wooden throne. He leaps up as Kirota enters. ""There we are! Look, you mongrels. Walking into my court, a man with solutions.""

Kirota stands at attention, sweeping his eyes across the court. Angry men in armor. Rich sycophants. Corrupt clerks. It smells like they've been arguing all day in here. There's a stink of hot breath and panic sweats. The room could use a stiff breeze.

The governor flashes a joyless smile. ""Seems like a miracle. You just swooped out of the sky on your beast. You don't hide your symbol. My nephew here recognizes the mark. He's clever enough for that. He tells me you can solve my peasant problems.""

""The east garrison has fallen. Rumor has it there was never a fight. The mob battered the gate and your soldiers threw down their weapons. You have since tried twice to retake it. Expensive failures.""

""You have been hearing lies, priest. There was never a fight. Spies have infiltrated my lands. They have coins for the disloyal. They have daggers for the stalwart. They have lies for the stupid. I am betrayed at every turn.""

""The emperor! It is his enemies that infect me. They strike at my lands to strike at him. He knows this yet he will send no aid. No soldiers, no wizards, no gold. I am to fight the nation's war by myself! Madness.""

""You are in a difficult place. If you are ruthless and ambitious, you can turn this difficulty into opportunity. My faith understands this. I am here of my own accord because I see potential in this conflict. It would prove useful to Yaezhing to have one of the faith on this throne.""

""Ah. Here we are. You want coin? You will have it. This is a wealthy province. I will build temples or send soldiers whereever you need them.""

""I am not interested in coin and Yaezhing needs no temples. When we visit judgement upon the deserving, people know where to send their prayers. Our shrines dangle by the neck at every crossroad. They lie on the doorsteps of their parents in a pile of their own skin. Our faith is blood and punishment.""

The governor cracks out an excited bark of a laugh, ""Yes! Blood and punishment. Here is my greatest fool mistake. I should have sought out your people sooner. I have never heard such wisdom. The heart of the world. Cruel but true. Tell me. What could you want of me. Wish and you shall have it.""

""I wish for order in these lands. I wish that the uprising disperses. I wish the service of a man who is unafraid to take power from fools. I want people to learn their place.""

""Ha! Marvelous. I want all these things as well. Please, tell me where to begin. What is my first task.""

""Before all else, you are to know that no one is above judgement. Not even gods.""

The nephew slides a long, thin knife up under his uncle's ribs. The governor flops back and forth, falling back into his killer's arms. He tries to cry out but the blade has his lungs pinned. Warriors across the court start shouting, reaching for their weapons. One glance from Kirota gives them pause. The governor slips to the floor without much noise or blood.

I think it is important to remember that every Buddhist is different and at different stages in their path, some will look down on others and judge, but I do not believe a blanket statement is useful, or correct in this case. 

Here is a Mahayana view -

&gt; Bodhisattva Sadaparibhuta used to say, ""I would never slight you, you shall all be Buddhas."" His saying indicates the ingrained truth of life. It denotes the attitude we ought to have towards all human beings.

&gt;We know that everyone in this world is different. There are the wise, the ignorant, the weak, the strong, the progressive, the stagnant, and the down-trodden. Thought distinguishes the faulty and the correct. Behaviour distinguishes the kind and the cruel. But the differences are never permanent. The differences between us should not be interpreted as good or bad racial qualities, or as fundamental differences in the natures of individuals. According to Buddhism the present differences between wise and ignorant, strong and weak, rich and poor, kind and cruel, are intermediate steps in the process of life. They are not final. As long as we have not achieved the perfected state of enlightenment we are all trapped in the ongoing process of cause and effect, reaping the results of past deeds whilst continually sowing the seeds of future crops.

&gt;Human beings are equal, and all of us are able to achieve Buddhahood."" Possessing this faith enables us to avoid slighting others. What is meant by ""slight""? Slighting others may involve demeaning them with our disdain, offending them with our pride, or abusing them with our insulting words and behavior. Whilst the tenacious attachment to the competitive self endures and the Buddha-potential remains unclear to us, we may be drawn into this ignorant and unskilful mode of being, alienating ourselves from others. Very often we are self-cantered and are inclined to bully others. This self-intoxicated pride is a distortion caused by an erroneous view of the ego-concept. Unfortunately, this overwhelming complex of egotistical ideas has been deeply ingrained in our hearts all along the chain of rebirths. Our egos have ensnared us in the endlessly repetitive round of transmigrations. Ego delusion involves us in successive births and deaths, making the wide world evolve with afflictions.

Anyway, I didn't lose it till 24.

Circumstances of why I didn't lose it sooner were... strange.  I'm still trying to understand and come to terms with why I didn't lose it sooner.

What I have learned since is that it isn't exactly my fault.  With sex -- how much, how soon, with whom is culturally determined.  You are socialized (or not socialized) sexually by the culture you live in.  Cultures with conflicting or confusing messages in regards to sex will probably create a few individuals who are, well, confused or conflicted.  Or frozen by inaction, or fall between the cracks... if you catch my drift.  This is almost by design (cruel but true).

After I learned the things I will talk about below, I realized that it wasn't worth blaming myself, feeling like a failure, self-hatred, etc.  Its not just you, its what this silly culture taught you.  It can also be unlearned, and once you start to see it for what it is, you can do better.

There are societies out there where teenagers are taught how to pleasure the other sex, and expected to do so.  Two that come to mind are pre-contact Hawaiian^1 culture and the Canela^2,3 of Brazil.  In both of these, sexual practices are really part of their culture and society.  It is taught and in both cultures, considered so important that it should not be left to chance (sounds a lot different than what you know?).  Imagine a culture where when teenagers (12-13 yrs) are considered ready, they would be taught the sexual ropes by older members of the tribe, so that when they got together with their own age members, they would know what to do, and do it right!  Imagine how alien this positive attitude is versus what we see in America.  

American society is sexually-permissive but not sex-positive (in fact, is it still very sex-negative).  You are allowed, but not really encouraged.  It is treated as a guilty pleasure (cannot discuss publicly, not on television, not on radio, only very clinical at school -- or abstinence only).  Its like some people are expected to have it (football players, cheerleaders) and others are not.  Its really weird when you think about it.  American culture also seems to celebrate success excessively, and punish failure.  But too much success is punished also.  It is a shame to be a virgin (failure, as a guy), but being too successful, as a slut, is shamed as well (people hide their true number of partners all the time -- if you are a woman).

In American society, men are expected to approach women and women are expected to play hard to get.  Women are shamed over their sexuality, yet turned into insanely unattainable sex-objects.  If you look at mainstream culture, sex is used to sell and it is almost like women are put on a pedestal for you -- you don't have to do it yourself, in fact, you have to learn how to take them back down yourself.

What to me is the smoking gun is how both pre-contact Hawaiian culture and the Canela have changed since modern religion has permeated their societies.  For Hawaii, they very quickly lost all their sexual practices and became much like mainstream American society primarily after missionaries and religion showed up and seriously started converting them.

I would strongly recommend that you read the below for starters.  It would at least help you see that you are just a product of the culture that raised you.  If you want to, you can change your relationship with sex by reprogramming how you see it.  First you have to be aware of it.

I've got more stuff if you are interested.  pm me.

"culqxh0","I never got any pleasure out of hurting animals, but I certainly did feel curiosity. Even at 10, I felt compelled to hit my dog just to see how she would react. Then I would make up for it by petting her and nurturing her. I wouldn't do that now, but I did technically know better at that age. When I was 4, I was very cruel to the dog, and would get a power trip out of chasing her into the corner and pulling at her fur. But now I see no reason to do that to an animal. Dogs especially don't deserve it. But I'm not a big pet person and probably won't ever have pets anyway. 

Anyway, I've interacted with many children, both as a child, and as an adult. I've seen children of all ages acting out cruel behaviors. Some of them may not be aware that it's cruel, but many are just curious and don't care. I mean, sure, if they're setting the animal on fire as a teenager, then that would be a warning sign.

This is the important bit. At no point had Nox denied Fellowship's juristiction over the pearl. It is theirs to claim at their earliest convenience. 

Other things that might have made this a violation of sovereignty:

1. BlackXnt had declared Fellowship a no-pearling zone

2. Nox had been banned from Fellowship.

3. Rogue had been granted asylum.

Unless I am horribly misinformed, none of those are the case. Perhaps it might have been moderately poor form to store the pearl in our own vault, but as there were no Fellowship officials available, holding it in our vault until they could make their wishes clear seemed the only sensible option. Ought we have broken into their vault and placed the pearl inside? Built our own in their borders? Sat around like a bunch of morons hoping an official would be on soon?

"cu34usd","'I think it would be best if I started at the beginning. The Bunker Project, code named 'Homefront' was a plan laid out by the government of the then most powerful nation on Earth, The United States. The US chose 4 sites around the country to construct large secure facilities, capable of surviving a direct nuclear strike. After construction completed each facility was garrisoned with 140 soldiers and provided with a list of 2320 individuals who would be evacuated to it in the event of a ""serious strike on american soil"". On April 22nd, 2041 that strike came. While all 4 had been constructed with a state of the art instrument array to measure radiation, receive signals from thousands of miles away and even contact satellites. Not a single array survived the blasts. 4 little communities of mankind dotted the wasteland, totally unaware of each other. and on April 22nd, 2141 all 4 sites sent out their ""100's"". all of which succumbed to lethal radiation poisoning in seconds. Not that the rest of the world or even North America was doused with such immense levels of radiation, in fact at this time small bands of roving humans were living their lives on the surface. But because the one of the many contractors the US hired to build the bunkers sold that information to their enemies. And each bunker site was targeted specifically with a device that produced a lethal kill field of radiation for nearly 50 miles. Your 100's, 200's, 300's and even 400's were just the latest victims of a pointless vendetta by people long since dead, hundreds of years prior. thankfully as the years passed the device, while still very radioactive diminished in its ability to spread that radiation nearly as far. Unfortunately the years had taken their toll, the bunkers were designed as short term solutions to provide at most 150 or so years of protection. '

'Bunker 1, just outside of Washington DC held many politicians and their families, the bitter divide into two main factions lead to years of hatred that eventually brewed into essentially a civil war. After the 100's failed to survive, a sense of hopelessness descended on its occupants. One group took it upon themselves to destroy the life support system maintaining the sections occupied by the other. In doing so they placed too great a strain on the remaining system as it attempted to restore support across the facility. On February 3rd, 2143 their computer system detected the signal of the final implant going silent.'

'We spent months trying to find the location of Bunker 2, we found atleast three conflicting reports to its actual location and none yielded any results. We intend to try again someday.'

'The device generating a kill field at bunker 3 was faulty and while their 100's passed away, their 200's were able to set up permanent residence outside of the former city of Los Angles. This is were my people come from, and on April 21st, 2241 my people left their cave and established the first true human settlement in North America for nearly 200 years. Today 'Williamstown', named after the leader of our 200's, is the bustling centre of human civilization in the south east. With more then 10,000 residents, both from the bunker and the descendants of survivors from the wastes.'

'And that just leaves you lot, the first survivors of Bunker 4, built in the wilderness of Washington state we were afraid you would be another bunker 2. Thankfully the radio reports you, yourself sent out led us right here to you. The device trapping your people turned out to be the most effective, locking you underground for over 500 years. You can only imagine the conversations we had about how to make contact with you. Eventually we devised the plan you've seen today. I'll admit it was dangerous, possibly unnecessary and cruel, but we needed to keep the lives of our people safe. We needed to make sure you were...normal, functioning humans.

I just don't think you fully appreciate the trauma they're going through as well.

My sister went through addiction and is bipolar. Thankfully she's regained control of her life and is beating her demons. That said, if she was in a similar place as the OP's SIL, I'd have the exact same concerns.

I just don't think you fully appreciate how impacted the MOTHER is in all of this, by her condition, her recovery, and no doubt the trauma she's experienced in her own life as well as being a single mother under CPS watch. 

They're not trying to create another dependency for her. They're trying to make sure the kid isn't fucked up and survives. She shouldn't take the kid outside while she's smoking. Nicotine is incredibly toxic to small children (especially infants) but disregarding even that, there's the issue of her ability to care for the kid entirely.

Common side effects of Klonopin include drowsiness, dizziness, weakness, unsteadiness, depression, loss of orientation, headache, sleep disturbances, **problems with thinking or memory**, slurred speech, dry mouth, sore gums, runny nose, loss of appetite, diarrhea, constipation, and **blurred vision**.

Additional side effects (severe) can include **confusion**, **hallucinations**, unusual thoughts or behavior;
weak or shallow breathing;
**unusual risk-taking behavior, no fear of danger**. Less severe (but also possible) side effects can include drowsiness, dizziness, problems with **thinking or memory**. She simply can't be trusted with an infant at this time on her own. That's **WHY** CPS is requiring her to be with someone else to help supervise her care of her child. 

Rarely for bipolar is *just* Klonopin prescribed. Usually there's a cocktail such as lithium, seroquel, rispodal, depakene, and/or other drugs that also have serious side effects. Plus, if she's a recovering heroin user, she's probably on methadone or a similar drug. These drugs also have confusion, dizziness, drowsiness, and other side effects that would make taking care of an infant challenging at best and terrifying in the majority of cases.

I hate to say this, and I know it sounds harsh and cruel, but the sister is NOT the primary concern here, its the child.

That's not mean at all, and it makes a lot of sense. But all of these great answers are helping me narrow down my problem:
&gt;but we don't know how long each user is going to live.

Sometimes I think I do know how long things are going to live. I think it's OK to store references in certain places because the way all the lifetimes are setup, it should be fine. But it turns out that my brain doesn't borrow check as good as the compiler and things aren't guaranteed to live as long as they normally do. At this point I'm stumped on whether I can convince the borrow checker that things actually will live long enough, or switch over to `Rc`.

I think this means I just need to get better with reasoning about lifetimes. When reading a function signature with a lifetime, it takes me a while to figure out what the lifetime is actually implying about the life of the variables they refer to. I think as I get better at this with practice, I'll be able to more easily decide whether it's necessary to have shared owners of the data.

"csugqol","This is going to sound mean and cruel, but in short:

If you have to ask, then you shouldn't.

Rust's model is about a single ownership, with a single mutable copy. This is what makes it so good, this is what means that all sorts of family of mistakes that are very common. This means that this are mistakes that early programmers will do, and not realize it. Back in my days I would spend days debugging C++ before I realized my idiocy. Nowadays my C++ is much more disciplined and like Rust, but I like Rust because the compiler will catch whatever idiocy I have to learn.

It can become frustrating the ""fight"" the compiler. Don't fight the compiler, it's trying to teach you a lesson, learn from it. Realize what is going behind.

So on to why use `Rc`.

Sometimes the single owner theory doesn't work. That is, we want a bunch of things to share a resource.

Say that we have a very memory heavy resource (something that consumes about 500MB-1GB of memory) but that is used by various resources. The resource is big enough that we want to get rid of it, but we don't know how long each user is going to live. So instead we make a large ""resource getter"" that will either load the resource for you, or give you the already loaded version everyone else is using. When no one is using the resource it'll free it up. Basically that's what an `Rc` does.

Notice the difference: you never ""realize"" you need an `Rc`. You start knowing you need an `Rc` and explaining why you are sharing resources. If you have to ask ""should I use an Rc here?"" the answer is almost certainly ""no"". The only way you should get to ""lets use `Rc`"" is by going the path ""I need a way to allow multiple consumers to have access to a resource, but I need to know when everyone is done so I can release the resource"".

So on to the example above, so I have my big heavy resource and I want to share it.

    trait LoadableResource {
        fn load()-&gt;Self
    }

    struct BigResourceGetter&lt;T: LoadableResource&gt; {
        resource std::rc::weak&lt;T&gt;
    }

    impl&lt;T: LoadableResouce&gt; BigResourceGetter&lt;T&gt; {
        fn get_resource(&amp;self) {
            if let Some(rc_res) = self.resource.upgrade() {
                return rc_res
            else {
                let rc_res = std::rc::new(T::load());
                self.resource = rc_res.downgrade();
                return rc_res
            }
        }
    }

There are other examples I can think were you'd want `Rc`. There's some examples were you'd want `Rc` but probably shouldn't use it, such as a tree that can contain the same resource multiple times (if it's not done carefully it could lead to implicit reference loops and memory leaks).

Generally though, I'd like that `Rc` was something as common knowledge as reference counters in C++, rarely used and mostly done in a wary fashion.

In short:

If you have to ask, you probably shouldn't use it. Sharing resources is a complicated enough deal that you should be well aware that it is exactly what you want to do (and understand the problem well enough to define it as such). If you fallback on `Rc` you miss on the opportunity to learn how to do things in the disciplined manner that efficient systems programming requires.",1436230969,"this is going to sound mean and cruel, but in short:  if you have to ask, then you shouldn't.","mean and cruel","cruel",NA,FALSE,"mean and cruel","mean",NA,NA,0

Well, I can't give you 20 films that came out *during* the war that very much crumble this nonsense about ""glorification of war"". 

I'm curious what you mean by glorify the US side, though. I suspect you mean in the context of justification, given what else you have to say about the narrative of a ""right and just war"".

Remember, *always* remember, that the Allies were reacting to nations who were invading sovereign states. That's pretty well justified. (On a side note, that's something the author missed too - in Korea, the North invaded the South. The United Nations were pretty justified in responding when the South called for aid.)

Are you saying that prior to Vietnam, WWII was not a justified war for the Allies? Are you saying that the narrative was created after Vietnam, as a response to Vietnam, or that it was merely amplified?

"csbso5i","Because Cloud is resistant, Cloud resisted slashing Aerith for instance.
The reunion is the Jenova cells gathering together. It has been stated that Jenova will always remain, as long as her body remains, or even cells of her. The Reunion is Jenova completing her body and making it whole again.

For the last time, every instance where you see Sephiroth, it is Jenova. Sephiroth is in his Mako cocoon in Northern Crater, not moving. The only other time you see Sephiroth is in the flashbacks. So the ""Sephiroth"" you see killing off the clones is Jenova. The line spoken is also ""I have no more use of this body"", which can be interpreted in multiple ways, but could be interpreted that Jenova no longer needs these clones.

Cloud does say that, but he says the following line:

&gt; ""He's here. The real Sephiroth is just beyond here.""
&gt; ""**It's** both incredibly wicked and cruel... But **it's** releasing a powerfully strong will from deep within the planet's wound.""

Why does Cloud suddenly refer to Sephiroth as... it? And no, you still fight Jenova later when you fight Jenova-SYNTHESIS and Bizarro Sephiroth also has two heads.

It is never mentioned in the game that Dio saw two Sephiroths. He says in a letter he saw Sephiroth and when you speak to him he confirms that it had a tattoo with #1 on his hand. 
This same number is repeated a few times throughout the game. Regardless, Jenova killed everything every time she appeared somewhere as Sephiroth yet Dio reports no attack. Why? Because it was a clone, not Jenova as Sephiroth.

And correct, this is why Cloud was always forced into handing the Black Materia. At some point in the game, Cloud gives it to RED XIII, or Barrett and then later asks for it and gets it back and promptly puts it inside Sephiroth's cocoon.
Once again though, you say Sephiroth cannot control Vincent or Cid, because they have never been injected with Jenova cells, but at what point do you see Sephiroth ever control anybody with Jenova cells? He certainly did not control Zack in Nibelheim in the flashback, but we're told that Jenova can when we look at the tapes of Gast and Ifalna. When did Sephiroth started to control Jenova, because it is never mentioned in the game.

Holy is associated with, but not necessarily the same as, good. The holy powers that be encourage altruism, selflessness, charity, etc. Angels are almost always nice to non-enemies. But a paladin can be a selfish asshole. However, said selfish asshole paladin would find his promotion opportunities limited by mid-to-high levels if he has a reputation for it: the bigger good might still be willing to use his talents, but they don't want him in charge of things. (Note that 'promotion' can mean 'access to high level spells')

Unholy characters may or may not be mean - for the most part the creatures that grant their powers don't care about morality. There's still a correlation - evil organizations tend to be ruthless to allies and enemies alike, and cruel people naturally gravitate toward such groups, but otherwise well-meaning (and even right-acting) people may use unholy power as it's the quickest way to gain access to a lot of force. A desperate peasant trying to overthrow a cruel tyrant would be more than a little tempted to get an army of devils on his side, especially if they promise to go away after the crown is moved.

This give a few openings: people who's ""alignment"" (who they are aligned with) doesn't quite match their moral-ness (asshole paladins, kind warlocks, charitable gangsters, and unaligned saints); it lets you add elements to 'holiness' or 'unholiness' that don't quite line up with good or evil - concepts like purity can really change the face of holiness without making them any nicer. And it allows morally grey characters quite easily: a cruel but strictly honorable tyrant might not be objectively unholy, even though it's not entirely unreasonable to call him evil.

You can use essentially the same logic for lawful and chaotic: lawful characters are those working with the powers of the lawful planes (modrons, formians, inevitables) and are most likely have orderly minds or strong socialist/autocratic tendencies. Chaotic means aligned with the chaotic powers (Slaad, uh, other slaad...) and are probably anarchists.

You don't need to include both axes. But you can. You could even include neutral (traditionally nature-oriented) powers. You can have nine different sets of outer-planes powers the charcaters could be aligned with. You can break away from the 3x3 setup entirely: have three alignments (good, infernal, and demonic. That's how the Blood War is set up anyways) You can have seven, one for each of your gods. You can 22. It's all up to you.

Some notes: don't make nonviolence a requirement for holiness: DnD worlds are very violent places as a rule. Chastity or teatotalling can be a fun addition, though. Anyone who regularly benefits from holy of unholy magic (either form spells of magic items) will pick up an aura. High-level characters will attract the attention of the outer planes, so a 15th level assassin will almost always have some sort of unholy aura to him, just not simply because of his behavior - the behavior attracts the magic.",1433363505,"and it allows morally grey characters quite easily: a cruel but strictly honorable tyrant might not be objectively unholy, even though it's not entirely unreasonable to call him evil.","cruel but strictly","cruel","but",FALSE,"cruel but strictly honorable","honorable",NA,"strictly",1
"cru1oz2","&gt; In the distance, I hear echoes of a titanic battle, bloody, cruel, but beautiful. 

I know you can do better than that :P

OT tho, I probably won't be able to play because that time of the year really doesn't let me have any free time, but I'll see about that later on.

One concern I have is that, you said it yourself, it's a competitive tournament. Something else you said is that it will be a 5 round swiss. Those 2 things go together like Growth and Thunder Surge: they don't. If you ever have the chance to, take a look at how tiebreaks work (especially the ones that challonge supports). In a 5 round swiss they are not fair, you might as well just use pure rng to solve a tie at that point (slight overstatement but you get where I'm coming from).

Few suggestions:

- Don't use challonge tiebreakers but deal with ties yourself. Respective wins is your best bet as primary tiebreaker (wins vs tied participants on challonge), matches lost vs tied participants and results vs tied players (order of these is something you should decided on based on what you think is fair). This still punishes you for having easy matchups, especially in earlier rounds, but it gets as fair as you can get.

- Have first round be based on rating. A lot of people might find this BS for a competitive tournament, but this way you ensure people actually play games that matter towards tiebreakers. Better players will get harder matchups, and will have a bigger chance to lose than they normally would, but this leads to getting fair standings, especially considering that the players who loses will probably fight their way back up anyway. This also makes it so that tiebreakers work better, as you can now reliably (mostly) use both respective results, progressive wins and berger (or buchholz).

- Have a finals tournament, this way you can both have finals (which are great for spectators) and give a more accurate impression of who actually is the best player. You'd have to look into this a bit as well tho, given that you still need to draw a line for who enters 2nd fase and where/when.

Boy, look at me with my big write-ups again xD Hope you can get something out of it. Here are some links you could use. [Tiebreaks](http://www.swissperfect.com/tiebreak.htm) and [OSSwiss](https://sourceforge.net/projects/oswiss/)

It's easy to laugh at someone in an awful t-shirt or flip-flops or whatever if you're feeling petty and cruel, but it's not right to do. I've seen people judge others outfits at a freaking church for a god who doesn't give a fuck about your clothes and overtly favours the poor, the humble, and simple living. 

It's hard for me to lament a more casual tacit dress code than for more ""formal"" ones. Special outfits veer uncomfortably close to ritual for my taste, it's seems absurd to me to have to dress in certain outfits for occasions where your clothing hold little or not utility. Wear a uniform when you're on the job, wear a light outfit because it's hot outside, that's fine. Wear suit to conform to the expectations and standards of the bourgeoisie as part of a deliberate barrier to interact equally with their class? No thanks.  

I think there are... well, I think business and business culture are themselves problems, but for the sake of argument they are just full of problems. It sucks that she still feels pressure to conform, but at the same time it's hard for me to lament when the conformity standard has moved away from senseless ""formal"" wear.

"criti16","I'll bite.

&gt;every bit as totalitarian and cruel... could be categorized as a form of fascism...

Wat? I could understand cruel, but totalitarian and fascist? That's like the literal opposite of libertarian.

&gt;Think about it. Libertarianism's primary demand is the end of taxation and a sell-off of what's left of the commons to private industry.

Libertarians don't want to end taxation, though maybe change and reduce it. Libertarians aren't anarchist, they want a government which requires taxation.

&gt;I don't know if you've ever noticed, but Libertarian criticism of the government usually stops at the military.

This is just... so very false. Ron Paul was a huge critic of military spending and our foreign wars. Literally this week Rand Paul has been filibustering the Patriot Act. He is close to successfully leading the end of warant-less spying on Americans. Libertarians have done more to limit the military and police state then anyone else in recent times. That's a fact, regardless of what you think about their other policies.

&gt;Think about it. They want to end ALL welfare and social assistance

Most libertarians want to remove most social assistance. Ron Paul was a doctor, as you maybe know, and had a private practice. Due to his libertarian philosophy, he didn't agree with medicare or medicaid, and he didn't except payments from them. Instead, he simply treated his patients on them for free.

Somewhat related, have you ever seen the family guy episode where tea-partiers take over? They cancel government, and the town falls into chaos. When I first watched it, I saw all the trash piled up everywhere and was confused. You see, I lived in Louisiana and we have private companies pick up your trash. It was hilarious to see people assume that without a government entity trash would just build up everywhere.

From a purely practical side, often government is a less efficient solution to a problem then a private entity. From an ethical side, many Libertarians think using government too enforce what you think is moral (beyond protecting your rights) is in fact immoral itself. Donating to charity might be good for you to do, but if I rob you at gun point and then give it to charity, have I done a good deed?

I'll only respond to a couple other things so this doesn't get too long.

&gt;there won't be enough jobs due to automation

That is a potentially serious issue with not just libertarianism, but capitalism. I think most would agree given enough automation fairly radical changes may have to be implemented. 

&gt;we would see a massive genocide, possibly even larger than the Holocaust. What do you think?

That's just outrageous and honestly sounds like a conspiracy theory.

"crhoupl","Ru'thar had seen much in his many years. He had seen feats of great Magic and even more wicked times. He had combated Trolls, Giants, and the great Mammoths of Skyrim. His blood had run cold in presence of Vampire and his heart quivered at the sight of horrific Daedra from beyond Oblivion. From the coldest peaks of High Hrothgar to the sweeping valleys of Hammerfell, all of Tamriel had shown him what it had to offer and the old Orc had found his resting place in the land of Skyrim.


It was a cruel but fair land, one which valued strength above all else. Those who were weak succumbed to it's perils while the strong prospered and endured. Though the cold was not something he enjoyed it was a minor complaint against the benefits the land offered. Nord Mead and Ale was more than capable of satiating his thirst and game was plentiful in the wild forests and hills surrounding his Clan's home. Food and drink were one thing and sport was another altogether, but not something Ru'thar found lacking. Bandits, Stormcloak rebels, rogue Magi and Necromancers, skulking Falmer, Drauger, Skyrim was a land fraught with danger and Ru'thar welcomed it. 


There was little more a proud Orsimer such as he could want for his Clan and his progeny. His mate had birthed him several sons and daughters all who displayed the same strength and pride that he did. Ru'thar's heart swelled as he watched his children mature and face hardship boldly, never backing down and never giving in to it's challenge. 


It was a good life they lived. Ru'thar was confident a good death would await them all in the end when their times came.


___________________

The sun sat high in the sky above the compound that day, much of the Clan were out and about enjoying the rare time of warmth Skyrim's summers brought to them. Ru'thar himself was seated in his favorite chair overlooking the Stronghold with a tankard of Mead in his hand. The wind against his face was a soothing breeze quite unlike the usual gale the mountains brought forth. The wind however carried with it the scent of death and the Clan Head found himself standing quickly much to the confusion of his mate. Though old his reflexes were as sharp as his old war sword.


Moments after the scent of blood washed over him did he hear the shouting. It came from the Stronghold's front gate, the noise of battle sounding from beyond the wooden walls. The watchmen on the towers rang the bells to alert the Clan. Used to danger from their prosperous surroundings the older women gathered the young and the unfit to the safety of the buildings while much of the Clan readied themselves. Ru'thar bounded down the steps of his home with a steeled expression. The sounds of battle gave way to the sounds of slaughter was whatever was attacking brought down the guards beyond the gates.


Ru'thar stood firmly dressed in his fur garments, the attack occurring too quickly to warrant his battle garbs. He would be damned to the Plane of Oblivion before he allowed his Clan to fight in his stead.


The gates began to rattle and buckle from the assault on the other side. Several more men and women joined their Clan-Head's side, armed with axes and great shields. The gates were pushed further and further inward, the sounds of the being's grunting and cursing indicating this wasn't a wild beast but a deliberate attack. Ru'thar tightened his grip on his sword's handle and narrowed his eyes.


Finally did the wood give way, nearly being thrown backwards and off it's hinges. Entering the Stronghold and to the shock of all those who looked upon it, there was little way of describing what was seen in any other way but an Orc! 


A massive man of green skin stood glaring towards the gathered Clan, many whom's faces held expression of total awe and disbelief. Orcs were known to be the largest of Nirn's common folk, dwarfing Imperials and even beating out the Nords in pure height. But where Ru'thar himself stood six foot three, this...beast stood well a foot above that and his figured was slightly hunched over to boot. His body seemed almost unnatural with how much of it consisted of rippling muscles and battle scars lining his dark green flesh like tattoos would any Orcish Berserker. In his meaty hands he held two weapons of equal size and brutality, an axe and a sword which more resembled rubbish when compared to the craft dedicated to a true weapon of Orcish make. Ru'thar was forced to come to the conclusion that what they were dealing with was not one of their kind. It was too unreal, too monstrous to be the same thing as they. It's eyes, beady and burning red, they held not the same spark that true Orsimer did.


Ru'thar could admit this being frightened him and excited him at the same time.


The Orc clanged his weapons together, snarling behind his massive teeth and slobbering under-bite towards the Clan, the scattered remains of the four Orcs who stood in it's path painting the doors and ground behind him. Ru'thar held his weapon tightly and he raised it high for his Clan to see.


""To me! Show this scum the price he must pay for attacking our home!""


Ru'thar's Clanmates yelled and roared, each thirsting for battle against this invader despite his impossibly appearance. The invader however did not reply immediately. Rather he stood straight upwards as several Orc warriors charged towards him, sucking in air through his flattened nose and the gaps in his yellowed fangs, he unleashed a roar which echoed throughout the Stronghold and challenged whatever bravery and strength the Clan had mustered with the brutal being's own primal strength.

"cqhsr58","Hi OP! I really do like the fantasy genre, because reading them takes us to a whole new world the author has created. Every writer is different in style and prose, but the goal in the end should be to guide the reader into accepting a whole new setting without question. Also looking at the title, there's a sense of 'tragedy' that will happen to Obrom, whom I'm guessing will be the MC. So let's see if I get there.

**Feedback**

&gt; Obrom's wife Rasa went for a walk one night and never returned. Obrom searched for her on the **arid pastureland** around their **tent**, but he found no trace. He wept, and for years and years Obrom prayed to Zahwu. **[I would break here, up to you, it's just a bit jarring to see Zahwu 3 times in a row.]** “Zahwu, Zahwu, save my Rasa and deliver her to me.” But Zahwu never answered. Obrom tended his goats and kept his **house** in order. The hair on Obrom's head turned white, and his beard turned white and his eyebrows too. **And everyday he prayed, and Zahwu never answered.**

For some reason the prose reminds me of 'The Alchemist' by Paulo Coelho. This is a good and bad thing, because people will either like the style or dislike it because of the 'dryness' of the language. Ok, some inconsistencies - arid and pastureland give me way too different visuals: arid means barren, dry, or dull, while pastureland is greenery for livestock. Tent and house also give me two different impressions. Keep one or the other. The closing statement is also repetitive (I would take out). The rest of the passage stays the same style and tone, but it's not as engaging as the Alchemist and twice as dry.

&gt;The stranger was about half Obrom's age, but looked at the old man as though he were a child. 

I have no clue how old Obrom is... and I'm not sure how to visualize that last input.

&gt;His hair and his beard were brown and dusty, the sun had pruned his face and browned it, but his eyes were sharp as daggers.

Ok see, the eyes of daggers is not the same as the gaze of a child... And why is he so dusty? This is not explained any further. Obram's culture so far to me is about being religious and to show hospitality. I'm slightly reminded of Greek mythology.

&gt; “The widowed and the lost.”

... I have never heard of a 'Master' of this kind of thing. Also Obram is neither widowed(his wife is missing for 40 years maybe, but she's not dead yet nor has he annulled their marriage) and he's not lost... so why would he be praying to this kind of entity?

&gt; “You did not pray to me tonight, **Obrom son of Obrom**. Why not? Has Rasa left your heart at last? Or was saying the words every night too much of a trial? Or perhaps in the dusk of your life, your memory fails you, and even old habits are forgotten.”

Meep. It sounds deep, even poetic. But I'm so thrown off. Also the bold tells me a lot, about the setting's culture, but also so little like a random tidbit of the language. Also when Obram addresses Zahwu I think you should stick to either Master or Zahwu, because it's 'weird'(sorry I don't know how to better phrase this) to switch over 2 different names for the same person in the same passage.

&gt; Only that her hair was long and auburn, and her skin was white as fresh milk.

Well, I know that's important later in the passage after skimming to the end.

&gt;“She yet lives, Obrom. I have not permitted the Morzians to kill her, though she has often begged them to...

Ok......After reading further lines from Zahwu, I don't like him. He's the antagonist right? 

&gt;Air waved and shimmered like seaweed. 

No. This imagery is bad. As far as we know, there's no ocean around them. So why compare the air to seaweed?
 
Reading on... we get to the gates of Morz. At the gate, there's a guardian. Everything about this place is dark, foreboding, etc. But the language is so dry, that it's almost lost. 

&gt;Of bone and sinew they were made, twisted into the shape of a gigantic skull, the entrance through the gaping mouth. Knives, swords, and axes formed the teeth. Obrom gagged at the sight of the skinless human limbs and heads impaled upon these teeth.

Ok, hear me out. This imagery is not bad. But since its the gate - how did they get past the mouth if what's sticking out are sharp, pointy weapons?

&gt;“Welcome, Obrom,” Its voice rolled out like the waves of the deepest sea. It smiled, showing its fangs. “Your beast will carry you to Rasa. Your courage in coming here is admirable. **Would, for your own sake, you had come sooner.**” And the creature bowed.

Again the imagery - there's no sea that we know of in this setting. Also, scary looking guardian is acting polite. I do not understand the last part of that sentence, is it supposed to be a threat? If so, he should turn around. The scary looking creature also is expecting him... that can't be good. 

&gt; He looked up and saw that the sky and even the air was the color of blood. And the sun was black as coal, and its black rays shone across the sky in all directions. 

Whoa, what now? Is he inside the skull? Was this some sort of teleportation gate? Oh my. I'm so lost. Reading further, the passage explains how everything and everyone is covered with 'black.' Everything is just black. I'm not sure if this is a metaphor or how are they even seeing things with black rays.

&gt;What can I do against such a place, he wondered.

This thought makes me angry/annoyed. Like really, he went into someplace dangerous without a plan??

&gt;It sounded like a person tapping a stone with another

I like this. But it's redundant. Take out 'it sounded.' We get that from the click noise.

&gt;There in the center of this place loomed a raised platform of smooth black rock with steps to its surface. The donkey's legs carried it up the steps and onto the platform. 

And why would he go up there? It seems like a very important place to not go up. Also where the heck did that guardian come from. 

&gt;Obrom stood straight and tall and brushed the auburn hair from his face. 
And every day for forty years Obrom heard that prayer. And then one day he did not, and on that day Obrom died.

Meep. It's a twist. But the resolution is just so... misguiding from what's told to us in the beginning. It leaves me confused and overly critical about the entire story. As a reader, I'm not quite sure what to make of the 'punishment' like deciding if it was or not justified. And what exactly was the punishment? So far, what I think just happened was that Obram transformed into his wife, so his Obram self 'died.' But where is his wife now? Also, I don't get why the donkey had to die. That was random and off putting to the actual resolution. How does Zahwu's character play into this? Is he punishing MC for not praying for one day - that would be cruel, but interesting, but nothing is revealed. And the guardian... is he just there to make fun of the MC? Also, I'm not sure why the wife would want to leave Morz. Everything seems so nice in spite of the dark imagery. No one's getting violent and the guardian seems polite. AND WHO KNOWS where the bones and the sinew came from - maybe that's how they honor the dead? And the black stone thing - seems pretty. 
 
I would say you succeeded me in bringing me to another place - but that place is fuzzy and I don't appreciate it. The imagery was not what I would call subtle. There was definitely too much 'black' going on in Morz and weak word choices throughout the passage. Other suggestions I would make are: show more of Obram's internal struggle, tighten up the ending, lessen the foreboding tone in Morz - it's overwhelming, and work on consolidating the theme/moral or symbols. I think the ideas are there, but needs better phrasing. 

TBH, I couldn't appreciate The Alchemist's prose either. The book was well-written and had a good story, but it left my brain feeling tired and I skipped to the action. But that's just me, and others will surely like this kind of story if it suits their taste, just not mine.",1429477182,"is he punishing mc for not praying for one day - that would be cruel, but interesting, but nothing is revealed.","cruel, but interesting","cruel","but",TRUE,"cruel , but interesting","interesting",NA,NA,1
"cqhgsk4","I mean this with every ounce of sympathy, empathy and support. I do NOT mean this as a criticism at all. I am only throwing this out there as a potential angle that might help you save this relationship and feel more comfortable in your own social circle: 

Have you tried standing up to his friends? 

I agree this is a last-ditch effort, I agree it is your SO's place to handle his relationships with other people. I am totally on your page. He should be the one to do it. But if he can't/won't and they ALREADY hate you....what do you have to lose? It is not like you're going to charm these people, so it is kind of tacit permission to be the bitch they expect you to be. You are just meeting expectations. If he won't say anything to Mr. F-Bomb, you do it. ""Bro, no swearing in front of the kids. Clean up your language or go to another room"". Someone bullies him into playing games? ""Aww, shoot. That won't work, I really need him home tomorrow. You'll have to find another time"". Will he look whipped? Who cares? If he wants to handle it, he can. If he won't, then fuck it. 

I am in 100% agreement that if your friends/family/co-workers are causing the problem, it is on you to solve it. But sometimes that doesn't work. Sometimes that is not going to happen. But, assuming you love this guy and you want to stay with him, perhaps the solution is to stop waiting on him to be the enforcer and do it yourself. Regardless of my SO, NO ONE gets to come into my house and be rude to me. I don't care who you are, you will be asked to leave. And...I gotta say...as an above-average bitch when it comes to confrontation, you only need to do it a couple of times. Once you establish yourself, people back off.

"cqcoqrw","The Holocaust was extraordinarily important for the Israeli psyche. There was, especially in the first two decades of the state, a huge tension at play. On the one hand, Israel was founded under the idea of *sabra* dominance and Israeli machismo of a sort. Zionism touted the idea of a Jew who was no longer at the whim of other nations and states, and powerful for the first time. A state was seen as the ultimate example of Jewish power and ability: a way to say ""Look, we will not allow atrocities to occur again"" (this ideology preceded the Holocaust, for the record). The Zionist Jews that later founded the state, like the first Israeli Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion, came in the Second Aliyah. This movement of people, from 1904-1914 roughly, made up only around 25,000-30,000 people by most estimates, but the ideology it brought (left-leaning and borderline socialist, and the idea of strong young men moving to settle in the region that would become Israel) lasted in future generations.

So this machismo, this whole image of a strong young Jew who would fight and plant and build the new Jewish state, was challenged by the Holocaust. On the one hand it was a perfect example of the need for this Jew. On the other, Jews found themselves questioning how something like this could happen. How could the world, how could *they* have allowed this to happen? Where were the fighters? Where was the rebellion?

So Israel, in its founding mythology and as part of its national consciousness, mostly eschewed honoring Holocaust survivors in totality. They were treated poorly, as people who submitted to the Nazis and failed to stand up for their identity. Only those who fought, as with the Warsaw Uprising and other groups like a specific kibbutz (Lohamei Hagetaot, the Ghetto Fighters) founded by former fighters of groups that fought the Nazis and their children, were seen as legitimate Israelis. It was a way of dealing with the collective embarrassment of failure to act, and brush under the rug as it were the way Jews were led to the slaughter like sheep without organizing themselves to fight.

After 1960 or so, there was a shift away from this ideology, but that's another story.

Regardless, genocide and the Holocaust clearly played a huge part in Israeli ideology. And that is why Israel was so concerned with morals in the case of, for example, the Adolf Eichmann trial. Israel did not have the death penalty, viewing it as illegitimate and cruel, but it made an exception for Eichmann because of the severity of his crimes in the Nazi regime. The idea of repeating the Holocaust or committing a genocide was never something Israel seriously considered it would do, and while I'm happy to challenge those who claim it has done so in the past or is doing so now, that is a discussion for elsewhere. That discussion is on history taking place in the past 20 years, which is not allowed in this subreddit.

As far as what precautions Israel took, if there were any, Israel signed multiple international covenants and treaties binding it to a commitment both defining and examining the crime of genocide. Israel signed and ratified, without any reservations, the 1951 Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (entered into force in 1951, passed by the UN General Assembly in 1948). It has ratified the Geneva Conventions, which classify civilians as protected persons and thus *de facto* would make it impossible to commit genocide without heavy violation of the convention. Israel ratified the Genocide Convention in 1950 by passing [this law](http://preventgenocide.org/il/law1950.htm), which gives Israel a claim to universal jurisdiction, meaning that if a genocide was committed in Germany (i.e. the Holocaust) and Israel caught a perpetrator, it could try them in Israeli courts just as if the genocide had been attempted against Israel.

That about sums it up, I think, unless you have more specific questions on the topic.",1429062727,"israel did not have the death penalty, viewing it as illegitimate and cruel, but it made an exception for eichmann because of the severity of his crimes in the nazi regime.","illegitimate and cruel","cruel",NA,FALSE,"illegitimate and cruel","illegitimate",NA,NA,0

"cpthha7","Like any grand or nightmarish moment of fate, my destiny came to me on the toilet. 

Just like everyone else, I had been waiting feverishly for my 18th birthday. The day itself was one giant anti-climax - I awoke awash in the glow that accompanies a soon-to-be legend. I climbed into bed that night in a huff - surely someone meant for glory would have been struck with their power the very moment they turned 18? Then why was I going to bed no different than I woke up?And what would everyone think if I never did gain my power? Or, maybe worse, if my power and I turned out to be a dud?

In the weeks following my 18th birthday I barely slept. Paralyzing anxiety wracked my brain, but I knew it had only one cure. Regardless of when fate would find me, the waiting game preyed on more than just my emotions - it also wreaked havoc on my naturally high-strung bowels. My IBS had flared up when I thought I heard a friend say that Bravo was cancelling Top Chef. Needless to say, it was in its heyday during my current emotional distress.

I was in the midst of one of my many marathon bathroom sessions when I realized the worst had happened. I was just settling gingerly onto the cold porcelain when I realized my phone was at less than 5% battery. Barely enough time to rouse the sleeping dragon that is my digestive tract and certainly not enough time for it to go about its volatile business.Nonetheless I settled in and, ten minutes post the death of my phone and after reading the backs of all the shampoo bottles I could reach several times over, a rumbling deep at the base of my being indicated that my intestines had worked through their performance anxiety. Several loud blasts were like music to my ears, signifying sweet relief from the cramps that rolled through my abdomen. 

*Creeeeakk.*  

*What was that?* I thought. *It couldn't be....*

Soft footfalls in the hallway sent adrenaline shooting through my veins. I could feel my heart pounding in my throat. Andra - my suspiciously quiet roommate - was home. Her bedroom shared a very thin wall with our tiny bathroom. My breath caught as I realized that one of my all-time top three nightmares was being played out and there was nothing I could do about it.  

As every muscle in my body clenched tighter, I suddenly realized that physical stress was unintentionally propelling my body to a grand finale that would probably be heard around the block.  *Noooo!!!!!* I screamed in my head - urging every pipe in my body to cease movement, block passage, HALT!!!  

Would but I could describe the sounds that came from my body that afternoon. There are no words. It's safe to say that it was somewhere between a ship fog horn sounding (long and loud) and the sloppy contents of a near-empty ketchup bottle being forced out so quickly that red globs shoot out in all directions.  

Shame rose up my face like a heavy steam and my forehead felt warm as I cradled it in my palms. *She must have heard that right? Is there any chance? Is she one of those people who judges you for having bodily functions...?*  

Andra's voice interrupted my agony. It sounded loud, brusque and oddly hard - there was an edge that I had never heard before. ""That is so disgusting!! How can she do that without even thinking - I never.... And what in the hell is she putting in her body? Healthy people don't make sounds like that... oh god, that smell!!!!! Holy shit!!""  

I abruptly burst from the bathroom, fly half-zipped and pants drifting open. ""Alright, already!!! I get it - you think I'm gross!! Just shut up or keep it to yourself!""  

I stared at her, feeling hurt but vindicated. After a moment, I noticed that her frown didn't look particularly cruel, but quite dumbfounded. She wouldn't make eye contact with me - was she embarrassed by her outburst?  

""Jess - what did you hear? Because I didn't say anything..... I didn't say anything out loud...""  

---

Years of waiting and anticipation, stress that had led me to spend so much time in the bathroom I knew exactly how long it took for my butt to fall asleep on the seat, the constant guessing at what my power could be - it had been years of energy and emotion invested in this moment. I know parents fear for their children's safety, maybe hope for a power that is low-profile. But my greatest fear whenever I thought about my 18th birthday was simple - what would others think about me? Would they admire my new abilities? Or scorn a boring fate they deemed appropriate for an unremarkable person? They say powers know you better than you know yourself and so I guess mine is fitting.

"cp6qlrm","If you are looking at a good fit lore wise these are the Houses explained: 

**Kurita:** Xenophobic A-holes that can't see past the narrow minded ""bushido code"" that dictates their ruling parties despite being a fairly diverse space society with a large population of Muslims and Scandinavian descendants. (even after the Rasalhauge split.)

They are also thought of as having the best individually skilled mechwarriors in the inner sphere.  Despite them fighting so ferociously it boarders on suicidal. 

**Davion:** ""Fedrats."" Sterotypical Davion's are very narrow minded and can't see past their own ideological ways.  And typically try to force their ""freedom's"" onto others. (Which is why many of them see them as a modern day ""america"" analogues.)  Also, thanks to their current ruler at this time, they are pretty much known as the ""warmongers"" of the inner sphere, sparking off the past two major conflicts leading up into the clan invasions trying to shove their own ideals down others thoughts.  

[Summed up perfectly by this image.](http://i940.photobucket.com/albums/ad242/xiebelvoule/I__m_Thinking_Arby__s_by_gunjackvalentine_zps4a72a750.jpg) 

**Steiner:** They are looked at as caring more about money then anything else, including their own military training.  They typically win by sheer numbers and very solidly formed tech as the economic powerhouse of the inner sphere.  But their actual mechwarriors and military training is kind of on the week side.  Its a large in-universe joke the best Steiner commanders are the ones with ""Davion"" in their last names. 

**Liao:**  Basically if the space Chineese formed a society like the one from ""Starship Troopers"" the book. 

They are typically seen as Zealots to the Confederation ideal's of Citizenship (The same idea of citizenship as in Starship Troopers.)   Which is where the ""Cappellan Whore"" saying can be looked at as. They are an insanely proud people in regards to their heritage and traditions, despite being bullied more then any other house throughout the succession wars.  

Their ruling party also has a bad case of hereditary paranoid schizophrenia that sees some of their rules go off the deep end sometimes.  

**Marik:** Unstable Patriots more content to blow each other up then deal with the rest of the Inner sphere with a nack for bureaucracy and stagnation.  As the only nation in the IS that is formed under a Parliamentary Democracy, the League is not so much a single nation so much as a rome like ""city state"" nation formed out of smaller states all under a parliamentary democracy. (Unlike the monarchy's of the other Succession houses.) Although this sees the states war with themselves more then they war with the rest of the inner sphere. 

As a result, they are also known as the premier weapons manufacturers and sales merchents in the Inner sphere. (With many of their manufactured mechs sold to nearly all the IS factions.) 

**Rasalhauge:** They are viewed as a Puppet state for Kurita. As they only gained their independence from them as a ploy to have a ""buffer state"" So Kurita can focus their military on their Davion front.  While their main populace is Scandinavian, Nordic, and other northern European decent, they also have a heavy Japanese population given their former status as a Kurita Providence. Their people are proud of their independence from the 5 great houses, almost to their detriment given that everyone else sees them as nothing more then a puppet buffer state for Kurita. 

**Clan Jade Falcon**: Seen as the most Aggressive of the Clans.  They are about fast, overwhelming firepower and damn to hell survivability as you swoop down and deliver a decisive killing blow. They are goaded and offended easily, and are insanely stuck up and snooty about their own superiority. Staunch Crusaders through and through. 

**Clan Wolf:** Known pack hunters, Wolves are known for their tight formations, tactical flexibilaty, and superior battle tactics that their commanders bring.  They are the most politically divided of the clans at this point in time, with staunch crusaders and wardens on both sides, making political in-fighting and ""one uping"" your political rivals something that sees a lot of tension within their ranks. 

**Ghost Bear:**  Patience and ferocity is the Ghost bear's philosophy.  They are about biding their time before they strike, but when they do, they make it fast, and decisive.  Their ranks share a close bond of family which minimizes in-fighting in their clan compared to others, but their patience and resilience lead them to not making the same gains that the more aggressive clans made during the invasion in the fiction. In addition to many missed opportunities when they where too patient to implement changes or act.  

**Smoke Jaguar:** They are the ""power gamer"" and ""Rule Lawyers"" of the clans.  They win by any means necessary and don't care who they piss off to do it. They bend the rules as they see fit and argue why its perfectly within the clan laws. Even if its blatantly ""illegal."" (Like Glassing an entire city's population committing genocide because they lost a VIP prisoner.) They view everyone as inferior and actually relish and value the idea that the rules are meant to be broken if it means winning (see Exodous Road, the Novel.) 

They are vicious, tenacious, and cruel,  but also liar's, backstabbers, and cheats, who throw tantrums at any slight against their precieved superiority. Which leads to them being completely unliked by nearly everyone both clan and IS. 

Not as if they care though, as long as they get their way in the end.  Which they are more then capable at getting.

As I understand Toastmasters, it's sort of 'brutal' with the intent to be. That is, you do Toastmasters to get over your fear of public speaking (and get better at it).. and part of that is facing the fear head on and getting honest feedback about it.

"cp0m68b","The Obama Administration knows all about ""war mode"" The tactics below are employed by the political left constantly. Not that it matters - they're all statists anyway.

1: **“Power is not only what you have, but what the enemy thinks you have.”** Power is derived from 2 main sources – money and people. “Have-Nots” must build power from flesh and blood. (These are two things of which there is a plentiful supply. Government and corporations always have a difficult time appealing to people, and usually do so almost exclusively with economic arguments.)

2: **“Never go outside the expertise of your people.”** It results in confusion, fear and retreat. Feeling secure adds to the backbone of anyone. (Organizations under attack wonder why radicals don’t address the “real” issues. This is why. They avoid things with which they have no knowledge.)

3: **“Whenever possible, go outside the expertise of the enemy.”** Look for ways to increase insecurity, anxiety and uncertainty. (This happens all the time. Watch how many organizations under attack are blind-sided by seemingly irrelevant arguments that they are then forced to address.)

4: **“Make the enemy live up to its own book of rules.”** 
If the rule is that every letter gets a reply, send 30,000 letters. You can kill them with this because no one can possibly obey all of their own rules. (This is a serious rule. The besieged entity’s very credibility and reputation is at stake, because if activists catch it lying or not living up to its commitments, they can continue to chip away at the damage.)

5: “**Ridicule is man’s most potent weapon.”** There is no defense. It’s irrational. It’s infuriating. It also works as a key pressure point to force the enemy into concessions. (Pretty crude, rude and mean, huh? They want to create anger and fear.)

6: **“A good tactic is one your people enjoy.”** They’ll keep doing it without urging and come back to do more. They’re doing their thing, and will even suggest better ones. (Radical activists, in this sense, are no different that any other human being. We all avoid “un-fun” activities, and but we revel at and enjoy the ones that work and bring results.)

7: **“A tactic that drags on too long becomes a drag.”** Don’t become old news. (Even radical activists get bored. So to keep them excited and involved, organizers are constantly coming up with new tactics.)

8: **“Keep the pressure on. Never let up.”** Keep trying new things to keep the opposition off balance. As the opposition masters one approach, hit them from the flank with something new. (Attack, attack, attack from all sides, never giving the reeling organization a chance to rest, regroup, recover and re-strategize.)

9: **“The threat is usually more terrifying than the thing itself.”** Imagination and ego can dream up many more consequences than any activist. (Perception is reality. Large organizations always prepare a worst-case scenario, something that may be furthest from the activists’ minds. The upshot is that the organization will expend enormous time and energy, creating in its own collective mind the direst of conclusions. The possibilities can easily poison the mind and result in demoralization.)

10: **“If you push a negative hard enough, it will push through and become a positive.”** Violence from the other side can win the public to your side because the public sympathizes with the underdog. (Unions used this tactic. Peaceful [albeit loud] demonstrations during the heyday of unions in the early to mid-20th Century incurred management’s wrath, often in the form of violence that eventually brought public sympathy to their side.)

11: **“The price of a successful attack is a constructive alternative.”** Never let the enemy score points because you’re caught without a solution to the problem. (Old saw: If you’re not part of the solution, you’re part of the problem. Activist organizations have an agenda, and their strategy is to hold a place at the table, to be given a forum to wield their power. So, they have to have a compromise solution.)

12: **Pick the target, freeze it, personalize it, and polarize it.”** Cut off the support network and isolate the target from sympathy. **Go after people** and not institutions; people hurt faster than institutions. (This is cruel, but very effective. Direct, personalized criticism and ridicule works.)

"coznqt2","Robert also didn't figure out that his kids weren't his or realize that he was financially running the kingdom into the ground. Robert was an idiot.

Renly in the books was the Tyrell's pick for the throne. You've met the Tyrells. The Tyrells do not choose who to back politically based on who the youngest of their three sons is fucking. They don't back losing horses, ever. And they picked Renly, who was an outside shot to begin with, the younger brother of a king with two living sons. They must have had a hell of a good reason to think that he would succeed.

And so they did. Renly in the books had something Robert didn't: like Tyrion, like Tywin, he was a real politician. Scheming and politics made Robert miserable, but they were Renly's bread and butter. He's already scheming to get Cersei off the throne *when we meet him* in the books, long before Robert was dying or Joffrey's bastardy was a thought in anyone's head. He went up against Cersei Lannister while Tywin was still alive. You don't do that unless you are as serious as a fucking heart attack.

He actually sat on the damn Small Council and took part in the governing of the realm, something Robert never did. Sure, he acted like a goof there, but so did Littlefinger and Varys and Pycelle, all for the same reason -- so no one would suspect them of being up to no good. He was the one to suggest that Ned Stark seize Joffrey when he had the chance, a cruel but very good suggestion that gave us just a hint of what's going on under Renly's cheery facade. 

Yes, Renly doesn't have much military experience, but when you have Randyll fucking Tarly and all the other military minds of the Reach advising you, you don't really need it. Either he had good ideas, or someone was giving him good ideas, and he was listening, because hanging out in the highly defensible Reach keeping everyone fit and happy with tournaments while waiting to swoop in and cut throats once his enemies were exhausted and wounded was a damn good idea.

"cov5sx4","Maybe it was selfish and cruel, but he never told her. In all of the visits, during all the updates, in every tearful *come back to me* and *I wish* he never once mentioned it. I never did because I made him a promise. When you're eight years old watching your father heave deep sobs into his big, rough hands, you tend to keep the promises you make. Even when there is no conceivable way you can possibly understand why on Earth your stoic father was openly weeping and begging you never to tell your mother. He kept repeating, ""I'm so ashamed. I'm so sorry."" over and over again. In stark contrast, he always told me. I can still hear the words echo through my memories: ""I AM your real father, just not your biological one.""

I loved my dad, but at his core was a lonely heart-of-gold who loved only a sleeping woman and an unwanted child. He was, by all counts, a broken man. Despite single-parenthood and ever-increasing hospital bills, he still found time for me, for us. We had 'Wacky Wednesdays' which meant breakfast for dinner. Every summer we'd go to this theme park about three hours away and he'd buy me an unlimited rides pass and all the chili-dogs and cotton candy my tiny little body could ingest. I had no clue the sacrifices he made for those memories.

When cancer took him in three short months, the extended family came over to help pack up our tiny rental home. Uncle Phil commented that my dad really was Superman, while going through dad's grizzled notebook. I still have it. They gave it to me before the funeral. On his birthday, I pull it out and read the comments on the side of imprinted debts and scratched out surpluses. ""Extra shift for summer trip"", ""Baseball glove or soccer cleats? Maybe both?"", ""Flowers for Monica. Must trim fat"". After all these years it still smells like him.

I got called to the office during fourth period. Uncle Phil and Aunt Jaymie were waiting with balled up tissues and red eyes. Ms. Landrey, the stern secretary who loved yelling at kids to get to class almost as much as she loved doting on the more unfortunate kids, broke down when I walked in. Aunt Jaymie suggested we go outside for a walk. Oblivious to the writing on the wall, I agreed and we left. Uncle Phil kept asking me questions about school and girls until Aunt Jaymie said, ""Phil. It's time."" We sat down on a park bench dedicated to a high school kid who died in a car crash two years prior. Always emulating his older brother, Uncle Phil tried to keep it together. He failed just as bad as Dad. In the end, Aunt Jaymie, through pursed lips and solemn tears, told me Mom's condition had worsened and the doctors didn't predict it getting any better. They were going to take me to see her, to say my goodbyes. 

All I can remember from the trip over was the striking juxtaposition of the hustle and bustle of the hospital floor with nurses yelling and babies crying to the solitude of gentle beeps and quiet whirs in mom's tomb. Uncle Phil told her he loved her and remembered the first time Dad told him about her. Aunt Jaymie admitted she had borrowed the stained cardigan and how she would always remember 'Wine Wednesdays' (I guess my family has a soft spot for hump day and alliteration). Then they told me it was time. They both stood behind me, silent guardians of a child who never knew this woman. Silence boiled my anxiety and I frantically searched for something beautiful to say. 

""Sh-should we give you a moment?"" my aunt tentatively ventured.

Without turning, I nodded yes and they somberly left the room. It was just me and my comatose mother. 

""I don't know what to say,"" I started. ""I don't even know you. It's not like we've talked or shared stories. You never cut the crust off my sandwiches or left me cute notes in my lunches. Whenever I fell you never kissed it to make it all better. What good are you anyway?"" Anger curdled in my stomach as I stood over the soon-to-be corpse of my adoptive mother. ""Dad wasted all his time on you! He worked three jobs to keep you alive! And what did you EVER do to repay him?! We came here every ASS FUCK WEEK! HE MADE SURE YOU ALWAYS HAD BEAUTIFUL FLOWERS TO WAKE UP TO!! WHY CAN'T YOU JUST GODDAMN WAKE UP!?"" Dad always taught me to control my emotions. My cousins remarked how weird it was I didn't cry at his funeral. Now tears streamed down my face as I collected myself.

""Wake up, okay? Just...just wake up."" I was angry at myself for crying like a baby and wiped my tears away with my sleeve in disgust, ""Don't make all of his sacrifices mean nothing. P-p-please...please, mom. Please just wake up. I need you. Please."" Have you ever blown up a balloon with the intention of popping it? You blow and you blow and it gets bigger and bigger. The small voice inside your head tells you to stop, that if you don't stop there's no turning back. And part of you wants to, but more of you can't. And then it pops. You jump and make a stupid face as if this event caught you by surprise. I laid my head on her hand and sobbed like a child, crying out to the void for my mother. 

Minutes went by. No longer was I trying to force my emotions down. Like the cliff on the edge of the sea, I simply let them wash over me. Each heaving sob brought back memories. Sunny Sundays with Dad telling me how he met mom. Rainy Thursdays playing Go Fish listening to Dad talk about their wedding. The off Tuesday sleeping in Dad's lap while he read mom's favorite book to her. Maybe she hadn't cut the crust from my sandwiches or left cute notes in my lunch, but for being in a coma she did the best she could. She WAS my mom, just not my biological one. 

Maybe it was selfish and cruel, but I didn't tell her. After all the visits, during all the updates, and in every *I love you, mom* and *wake up soon* she knew. Why should I tell a dying woman something she knew from the start?

"coumzzq","The hard truth for r/politics is the GOP aren't the ""bad gus"" they would like them to be. The GOP represent a different view point from liberals on several issues, and their positions on taxes, entitlements, etc resonate with a lot of Americans. There is a very real moral argument towards taxes, welfare, etc in politics and while Democrats see no problem with increasing taxes and entitlements, conservatives have moral and ethical reservations. Often times taking a stance against expanding medicaid sounds heartless and cruel, but that doesn't mean people don't legitimately oppose it because they are evil. 

The way this sub justifies the GOP's existence is by saying conservative voters are uneducated, vote against their self interests, brainwashed, paid shills, etc who elect these evil people to destroy the country. The reality is, many people dislike what Democrats have been doing (the ACA is still hugely controversial) and vote conservative, and some people believe that higher taxes and entitlements doesn't cure our economic woes, and there is legitimate data to back up those beliefs. 

Many republican politicians use hyperbole and fear to motivate their constituents; senator Cruz is an excellent example of this. But liberals have their tactics too.

"coj4bld","I guess I have a pretty good experience with fun. My fortress given the name Blaze Coppers (i think it was actually called Bitch Bitch, but cast that from your mind). This was one of my later forts so I decided I would try to make a megabuild, in the end I decide to make a weird form of the Angkor Wat, the water temple in Cambodia. I embarked in a swamp and after several pretty grueling years i had built a fairly sizable stone temple, complete with 15 z-level spires, and a massive square lake surrounding the temple. All of the dwarves were living inside the temple, most slept in dormitories but i had about 8 Great Shamans, who ate, drank, and slept in the upper spires, and never left their chambers (to pray to the Armok or something :/ ). The fortress was a truly lively place, there was plenty of food and drink, and the Angkor Wat is surprisingly dependable. Although the above ground was an amazing place, it was the under ground that was my pride and joy, the reason I even play dwarf fortress. Underground was the dungeon. In every fortress i build a prison, truly savage places of grey smoothed stone pillars and walls, jail cells made of iron bars, and iron chain shackles on every wall. The Angkor Prison as i called it held several dozen cells, not to mention the oubliettes filled with snakes, and a labyrinth (also filled with snakes, we had an excess of them). I loved that place.

To show my love to the Angkor Prison i filled it with all manner of things. Every time goblins invade, ""try not to kill em' we want em' alive"", every time a caravan elf or human showed up, ""send em' down to the dungeons"", every time a poor animal happened to wander into a perimeter cage trap, ""Chain em' up!"". Some of you might find it disturbing and cruel, but don't worry, the elves got their own section away from the humans, they were put in what I like to call the ""Weapon and trap testing facilities"" for... research. The others still got their fair share of beating and sacrifices though, every month we would slaughter a prisoner over the lake around to praise Armok. That was only with the humanoids though. I had little use with the animals. The snakes of course were used in torture pits but other than that most animals were just left strung up in their cells, although if any were hostile to each other they made to fight for the entertainment of all. Although there was one funny thing I discovered while looking through the animal section for possible fighters. I had four or five grey langures (monkeys) that seemed to be firing projectiles at a bog crawler (a notoriously aggressive yet ordinary creature found in swamps) through the iron bars. The bog crawlers cell was absolutely full of this brown refuse. Upon inspection it said it was feces. The monkeys were throwing their crap at the bog crawler. This made me laugh probably more than it should have, especially when i saw that the bog crawlers entire body was covered in bruises from the normally entirely harmless poo throwing. After watching for a good few minutes I moved on to other things (most likely torture or sacrifice) and i forgot about it completely. That was the mistake that destroyed Angkor Wat.

After several years my prisons were full, overflowing really. I knew if i wanted more humanoids i would need to start clearing cells so that's what I did my military went from cell to cell in the animal section, bludgeoning an animal and letting the haulers bring it up the the butchers. It took a while but it was quite fun. Finally we came to the bog crawler. Then I remembered his plight. He had been down there for years being pelted by feces day in and day out. I debated whether or not to leave him there but in the end i decide I would kill him and put an Elf in his place. To understand the next part you need to realize my military was garbage. I never completely got training down, I find it confusing and buggy, so my military gets all of its training from what little combat it gets. I don't even have that many soldiers, maybe 15 bronze equipped (we literally ran out of iron building the dungeons...we had to finish it with silver D;) saps, my fortresses are mostly defended by traps anyway. Still they had had no trouble dispatching the other animals, i split all of my soldiers into squads of two because it more practical for what i use them for, and one pair of them killed a tiger with maces! So any way i had one pair stand in front of the bog crawler cage (where they got pelted with dung) and i unlocked the door. I told their squad to attack the bog crawler, and waiting for my new friend to be slaughtered one of the guards moved in close to the bog crawler and took a swing with his mace and.... missed. The next thing i know he was missing his lower jaw. A heart beat after that he was missing a leg, and had his skull crushed. Apparently when killing an animal on a chain it is first released from its bonds and then killed. Who knew. Well the bog crawler moved with a pretty shocking speed for someone who had not moved two feet in years, and instantly snapped the neck of the second soldier. By this point I realized how royally screwed I was.

After years and years of being pelted by poop the bog crawler had unsurprisingly become pretty good at dodging poop. If I had checked its health a second time i would have seen that all of its bruises had healed. It hadn't been hit by a single flying turd in years, even when there were five monkeys 4 tiles away flinging constantly (and with pretty good aim too). Inadvertently i had created the perfect Danger Room, and along with it the perfect little monster. I got all of my military in the hall way ready for the charge, but I knew it was no use. Our fates were sealed. The crawler barreled his way through the ranks, killing one by one with even breaking a sweat. After reading the battle reports I checked its health. Still. Not a scratch. He had killed 15 soldiers without getting so much as a bruise. He was tired of getting bruises. Trying my best to keep him from leaving the dungeon I pulled the lever linked to all the chains, I called it the fun switch. Every prisoner came flooding out running towards the exit, and the bog crawler running towards them. Needless to say they all died. Still. Not a scratch. The bog crawler left the dungeon now, moving into the main court yard, seeing light for the first time in several long 'crappy' years. He walked out into the sun in an aimless meander. I swear i though he might have just left through the main gate right then and there, maybe leave the map, who knows maybe he would find a new swamp to live in. I wasn't so lucky though. He saw some dwarves leaving the main hall and his ferocious lust for revenge returned. At this point I stopped controlling the dawrves. I wasn't ordering them into burrow or getting civilians in armor. I was just watching. He killed the poor few who walked out, throwing one of their arms into courtyard pool. Then he stepped into the main hall. Stupidly the main hall had one entrance, no other way out but through the front. I have seen (and done) a lot of really of severely messed up shit in my years playing dwarf fortress, but nothing compares to 80 dwarves pilling into the back of the main hall, cowering in fear, and being absolutely blended by a bog crawler. At least when demons attack they have the decency to cover your vision in smoke so you don't see it happen, the bog crawler just covered your vision in blood. Men women and children were absolutely annihilated. 
 
I watched as the bog crawler searched the temple killing everything, every pet following his master, every craftdwarf at his workshop, every miner returning from the mine. Eventually he chased a servant dwarf up the spire steps and killed him and the High Shamans. He killed everyone. I checked his health. Still. Not a scratch. His hate fueled him so much he wiped out everything. Sadly I can't remember the name he was given for his kills, but whatever it was he earned it ten times over. And that's where I left him. standing atop the High Shamans' spire, drenched in blood like the fortress that was now his. I abandoned the fortress, whatever happened to the last few stragglers either still clinging to life in a pool of blood, or those hunters lucky enough to have been outside, I do not know. I've always wondered if I could enter the fortress as an adventurer and find that bog crawler, sitting atop that spire, and then he would brutally kill me. Still. Without a scratch.

"codfjrs","A few things: your ""puppies dying in nature"" and ""they can't go back"" argument is flawed.  Just look up ""wild dogs"" on google, and you'll find that there are packs of wild dogs in Detroit that aren't dead.  They do attack humans, which is bad, but I know that Detroit has a lot more problems than just wild dogs.

Secondly nature being ""violent, viscious, and cruel"" is only showing one side of the coin.  Nature also gives food and shelter. Even the world that us humans live in is violent, viscious and cruel, but we survive.  Also, how would you know that there lives would be miserable? Can you talk to dogs? When someone speaks for another like that, it only informs me of what they think the other would feel.   If I wanted to truly know, I would ask the animals being spoken for, or even possibly an expert in that animal.  

Secondly, I can't abandon the captivity of civilization and live off the land, because I already do that.  We humans have adapted to the city life, and though it seems cushy it is just as cruel and viscious as living an agricultural life.  I could walk down the street and be murdered, I could lose my job, I could get arrested then have that crime on my record for life. 

 Also, if I could, I would live in the wild, but eventually a landowner or park ranger would discover me, and they would rescue me back to the city.  The only hope I do have is to buy up my own land and live on that.  I might die, but it would be a great way to die. 

Lastly, about pets having ""a very existential"" freedom.  So we can't aguish over their captivity, but we can say that they live in a state of greater bliss?  No, I don't believe that.  Firstly, when a pet tries to escape their home, what does that mean? If they loved their home  so much, why are they constantly trying to escape it? Shouldn't they be content with what they have and see an open door as a gateway to a worse life?  Also, how do you know about this existential freedom? Did the pet tell their owners this and there was a great consensus, and they all told you?  You can't anguish over a philosophical captivity, but you certainly can make statements over their overall existence?  I call b.s. on that point.

one more point, living a life provided for you is great, but it does not equal freedom, because most of the choices made are made by your provider.  You might be able to tell your provider what choice to make, but I doubt all pet owners get their pet's feedback when making a decision for them.

"cnpr40m","Brian K Vaughn got me into comics.  To this day *Y:The Last Man* is literally the only story I consider to be nearly as good as *The Wire* by David Simon, and I've spent nearly a decade trying to find a story as good as *The Wire*.  

Since you into BKV, I'd also recommend *Pride of Baghdad* (a one run novel about a pride of lions that escape from the Baghdad zoo shortly after the 2nd Gulf War), and the first run of Runaways, which does a fantastic job of throwing superhero tropes on their head, while also throwing some Old God goodness in there.  You've covered the 3 I value the most (*Y:The last man, Ex - Machina, Saga) so I won't go into those, unless anyone wants to press me in which case I won't shut up about them.

Other favorite graphic novels

* *The Walking Dead* by Robert Kirkman is at this point on of the most popular GN out there but it's worth it.  Shitty dialogue, great art and great story arcs though.  

* *Superman: Red Son"" Superman's baby transport starcraft takes a few extra hours, lands in a commune just outside of modern day Ukraine.  Stands up for The People, Progress, and various other Socialist ideals.  Fantastic alternate history.  

* *Maus I &amp; II* by Art Spiegelman is considered a modern classic.  It tells the story of his father before, during, and after the holocaust, and Spiegelman does wonderful work by using mouses as Jews, dogs as Americans, Cats as Nazi's, Frogs as french... it's heavy and cruel but just... beautiful.

* I'd also recommend his harder to find book *In the Shadow of No Towers* which recounts his experiences during 9/11 in NYC, the fear he had for his daughter (who went to school nearby) and his thoughts on a post 9.11 world.  It's paranoid, jumbled, chaotic, just a mess really.  But it's wonderful, and if you can empathize with him ideologically, I think you'll appreciate it.

* *Watchman* by Allan Moore is a classic, but I'd also implore you to look into his contemporaries

* *Planetary* and *The Authority* by Warren Ellis are both great runs.  I'd recommend Planetary especially, it's a wonderful decomposition of the modern advent of comic books and super hero's, and the ""death"" of pulp fiction in ""comics"".  But The Authority also tackles many topics from one world governments, to far space threats and how to properly deal with them.  It's good, but I prefer Planetary.

* *Supergod* by Ellis is also worth a read.  At 6 issues it's easily managable, but goes into fantastic depth about the way we idolize metahumans and how potentially destructive that could be.

* *Blankets* by Craig Thompson is the last novel I want to mention.  It's really nothing especially remarkable, but it's beautiful in it's execution.  Thompson does a fantastic job of telling the story of his sexual awakening, within the context of his strict religious upbringing with a sort of flair and unbiased perspective you normally don't see.  While I have no doubts he was trying to make a point, ultimately, I think Thompson wasn't trying to convince anyone one thing was right or wrong, but just sharing his experience.

&gt;In his prepared speech Breivik gave a major focus to a statement by Norwegian social anthropologist Thomas Hylland Eriksen. The quote which originates in a January 2008 interview with Eriksen, and which was later in that year the focal point of an article by Fjordman, is:

&gt;""Our most important task ahead is to deconstruct the majority, and we must deconstruct them so thoroughly that they will never be able to call themselves the majority again.

&gt;Breivik explained how he interpreted Eriksen's statement to mean that Eriksen, and the rest of the multiculturalists, want to deconstruct the Norwegian ethnic group so that they will never again constitute a majority. Eriksen has been called as a witness for the defence and will appear before the court later in the trial.

&gt;I'd like a link about how Breivik was prevented from forming a a political party. 

#

&gt;In response to questioning about his motivations, Breivik said that he had tried more peaceful methods to convey his ideology, and had been resisted by the press. He decided to use violent means. This would have involved targeting the actual Labor Party's conference, or a Norwegian journalists' annual conference. In the event he had no time, neither to detonate more bombs. It was then that he claims to have conceded to an idea to launch the shooting spree on the island, and due to human limitations did not manage to shoot everyone there.

Bill was an orphan on the streets. He was taken in at a young age by one of the local thieves guilds. Living and learning by their rules and codes Bill became tough and cruel, but loyal to those around him.

Left with little choice if they did not want competition in the near future the guilds came together for a trap against Bill.

Darkness overtook Bill, and he knew his damnation for his crimes he had comitted. One of the local priests saw the end of the strong arm inforcer and felt pitty on the lost soul.

"cnizhvq","That ship has sailed for more and more Christians.  We have evaluated the evidence for ourselves, and the claim of inerrancy (as in no internal contradictions or contradictions with history or science)  is a) a claim that doesn't hold up, and b) a claim that undermines the Christian faith in a profound way.

Well, the way, the path is Christ, not the Bible.  So, put your faith in Christ, not the Bible.


&gt;The Bible is inerrant.


Christ didn't come to earth to write a Bible, Christ came to establish a Church.  The Church throughout history has never been perfect.  The Church, like all human things, is flawed, broken, at war with itself, irrational and cruel.  But, still, this is the Bride that Christ chose.   The Church writes scripture, doctrines, liturgies, sermons and stuff, but the heart of the Church is never in its writings, but in its people.  Faithful, loving, forgiving people.  We cling to the people, listen to the writings, and find Christ together.


&gt; Go back to God's Word.


Yea,  Go back to God's capital W Word.  And, as we read in John 1, the Word became flesh and lived among us.  The Word of God is Christ.  The hub at the center of our faith (and theology) is Christ, not the Bible.  The Bible (and the whole topic of God's revelation) is but a spoke in our faith, not the hub itself.

You are to be held accountable in the same way as any other choice you make in life.  (Including the education you get (or quit).  Whether you ""choose"" a life of crime.  Etc. etc.)  You tell me.  If we're accountable for not committing crime, then we're accountable for our attitudes and actions towards ""God"" as well.

I agree with the rest of your analysis about free will, fwiw.  But if you're whole point is, ""I can't change what I think about God!"", then you run the same danger (and accountability) as someone who says, ""I can't change my wanting to molest kids!  (Now, where are the nearest kids?)""

We still hold them accountable.  It's no different here.

&gt; Don't you think these poor kids would truly believe in Superman? Given the amazing variety of human beliefs, the answer is obviously ""yes"". So frankly, I don't see these as ""crazy"" analogies. They would be cruel, but absolutely possible, to engender.

With all due respect, you ignored my point -- possibly the most important, since ""free will"" is really a sidebar -- that the is the option of Spinoza-esque (or other like-minded) practices/beliefs.

You ""choose"" to turn away from these as well.  (The fact that you just chose to ignore that in your post shows how strong/devout you are in your free/non-free will in doing so.)

"cniwjiw","&gt;The bottom line is we are each still held accountable for our actions and our decisions. Our decision in how we, right now, approach or react to the idea of ""God"" is no different. (I.e., respectfully, I really don't see your point as relevant in this context.)

Free will is long argument.  I'll go ahead and identify as a ""compatibilist"", i.e. that its likely we don't have ""free will"" at the lowest deterministic level, but that this level is so far removed from our frame of reference that we have the appearance of free will for all practical purposes, which does include accountability for our actions.

But at an even more practical level, we *don't* have free will to choose the major components that affect our life.  We don't ""choose"" to be born, where we are born, our parentage, country, basic environment, influences, brain chemistry, the list could go on....  Our life ""choices"" are practically constrained within a fairly small envelope.

So, if I experience life and have innate tendencies that reasonably make me skeptical of whether a god exists, in what way am I to be held accountable for that by the god that I don't believe in (if such exists)?

&gt;But, right now, you choose to ignore this element. Right now, you choose to equate all Christians (and probably other religion-practitioners, I'm guessing) with ""superman"" or ""human flight"" believers.

No, I don't think that at all.  That's just the stock analogy I pull out any time someone claims we have a ""choice"" of belief.    Folks who truly believe in a god have no more choice in the matter than I do in my non-belief.  That's the whole point, one doesn't ""choose"" such things.   

Cconsider this:  If someone indoctrinated their children that Superman was a real entity (and he would be a god for all practical purposes), formed a cult around this belief, etc...  Don't you think these poor kids would truly believe in Superman?   Given the amazing variety of human beliefs, the answer is obviously ""yes"".   So frankly, I don't see these as ""crazy"" analogies.  They would be cruel, but absolutely possible, to engender.

To take the point further, compare the capabilities of Superman and Yahweh.  Who is the more amazing entity?   Crazy analogies?  I think not.

On further point, meant to add but hit the button too soon...

&gt;I mean, in the extreme, serial killers (or pedophiles, or whathaveyou) talk about how they couldn't resist the urge, and they can always describe traumatic events in their life where we would go, ""Ah, yes, I see, of course."" Even Reebers on Firefly have a reason to do what they do, right?

You're absolutely right, this view requires a little more sympathy for such people that are so made as to be able to do such acts.

I really recommend watching 'The Tower' again, brah. The energy projected by Finn's arm was an unstable amount of power, and thus if something went wrong it would have made serious damage. And PB saved his damn life; if she hadn't come along, he would have suffocated and died on top of that tower. Jake was giving Finn both good and bad advice too; he was telling Finn to listen to his heart, which is good, but what Finn's heart wanted him to do would have led him down a dark path. Revenge doesn't satiate anything, and Finn himself realizes this before it's too late. The only thing that was different about the outcome was that it was PB who got punched, not Martin. The results, however, would have been the same regardless. 

The wizard community's mentality is literally ""You will die or be put in prison if you disagree with our beliefs"". That's fascism, and it's worse than anything PB does. 

Sorry, but the Rattleballs didn't have lives. Yes, they walked and talked but they don't think. They were purely designed to fight. When they ran out of guys, they found fights in each other. If something wasn't done, then they might have destroyed themselves into nothing or found fights in candy citizens. You seriously sound like a troper with this whole ""they have feelings"" nonsense. They didn't; they were tools created for a simple task. Was it right to outright destroy them? No. But don't feed me shit and tell me it's meatloaf; they had as much independent thought and emotion as a goldfish. And our Rattleballs was an unknown; PB did not make him a hobo because she didn't know he survived. How did he survive? *Because he was the only one who had the will to*

I didn't say their plans wouldn't work because PB is smart, brah. I said they wouldn't work because they wouldn't. Have worked. Common sense is what PB used, you know, the brain in her skull? The reason why they didn't work was because none of them would have - no one was around to see the flares, or to answer the radio. They were in the middle of nowhere. 

PB freaked out in 'Nemesis' and went into Red Alert because the Peace Master said straight into the camera ""I'm totally going to vanquish you"", and she assumed he was talking to her. She didn't care about him finding the cameras. Know why? [Because everybody knew about them already](http://images.wikia.com/horadeaventura/es/images/archive/f/fe/20130109235244!You_Made_Me-_Adventure_Time_Full_Episode_0411.jpg)

I really don't want to argue with you about how Bubblegum's spying is a parallel to America's homeland security; no matter how you look at it, it's a grey area; not black and blacker like you think it is. And I like how you say ""so called protection"", as if her methods do not yield positive results. 

And yeah, everybody was obstructing justice you're right...but it's still a joke as well. Writers can do that, you know. 

Flame Princess was considering it though; her brother is implied to have suggested destroying it in the past, but now he has a reason and Flame Princess doesn't put it out of the question. Like PB, she is willing to do what it takes to protect her kingdom. How come she gets a free pass, and by committing nuclear genocide no less? Sure, FP ignored her brother before the events of 'The Cooler' (which were caused by PB), but the fact that her brother is so eager to use them and the princess herself isn't willing to totally put the issue aside in times of a crisis does raise a few flags. Not to mention, unlike PB Flame Princess isn't ageless. What will happen once she's dead? When will Bubblegum get another chance to have a trusting Flame King allow her into their inner sanctum?

"cmyh7og","To be honest I find myself agreeing somewhat with the idea behind this. Though the legitimate rape thing is something which may make it a non-runner. 

Nobody should have to go through with a pregnancy from non-consensual sex and that has to come first and foremost. Even the claim of rape should be enough I think. To my mind, rape is the most heinous of all crimes - you can justify many a murder but there can never be a justification for rape and the consequences will last a lifetime for the victim. The thought of making that worse by forcing her to bear a child for whom she'd have such conflicting emotions strikes me as a barbaric and cruel.  

But, if you are old enough to have sex then you can live with the consequences and that applies to both parents equally (though clearly it's much harder for the mother). Yes, it's the womans body, but she knew that when she had sex so no point moaning about it afterwards. 

Obviously, abort if both parents consent or if there is any risk to the mothers health, physical or mental (hence saying that even the claim of rape should be enough). But if somebody killed my child (and while I agree with abortion, I don't agree with pretending it's something it's not), it'd destroy me. 

A man is expected to live with the consequences of sex and nobody blinks. That needs to swing both ways I think.

Playing an Evil character, especially in a Neutral and Good group, is tricky, particularly if your character is willing to do evil for simple personal gain.

 In my experience, Evil characters are much more interesting when they have something, anything, that they value and do evil on behalf of. This doesn't have to be to the exclusion of evil for personal gain, naturally.

 It doesn't have to be something positive, of course- but if there's something that motivates your Evil character beyond simply ""personal gain"", he'll be a much more compelling character.

Some examples from my own characters:

Arzel, a Lich (Generalist Wizard). Neutral Evil. Did horrible things to people in the name of advancing arcane knowledge. Never needlessly cruel, but quite happy to sacrifice an entire innocent village if it would shave an hour off of his next spell's research time.

Cuvier Carolus (Dread Necromancer). Neutral Evil. An exiled noble. Raised an army of undead and acquire a slaymate through horrific evil to reclaim his birthright (which he had been deprived of due to his practice of Necromany.)

City Watch Commander Makima (Duskblade, NPC). Lawful Evil. Believed that people are animals who can only be kept in line through fear, and must be constantly reminded of what awaits lawbreakers. A devout worshiper of Hextor.

Karistus Kamastvat (Conjurer). Lawful Evil, and a Tiefling at that. Grew up in Baator, raised by his fiendish grandsire. Tempted the good towards evil in his spare time, but also hunted down Evil individuals that their souls might be drawn to his native Baator. He died fighting alongside a troupe of Paladins (The DM having removed the provision against them associating with Evil individuals via bazooka), and in the end, they erected a memorial in his honor. If memory serves, the inscription was:

"cmdl40g","Ok, I'm going to regret this, and I'm going to be downvoted to hell, but here goes:

I'm American, and circumcision is a pretty common thing over here. [About 30% of men worldwide are circumcised](http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2007/9789241596169_eng.pdf), but, [in the US, about 60% are circumcised](http://www.webmd.com/children/news/20130822/us-circumcision-rates-drop-by-10-percent-cdc). The American Pediatric Association, the preeminent organization for pediatrics in the US, officially says that newborn circumcision should be the choice of the parents/guardians, but [it does still recommend circumcision to prevent risk of urinary tract infections and the contraction of STDs](http://www.aap.org/en-us/about-the-aap/aap-press-room/Pages/Newborn-Male-Circumcision.aspx).

Despite all the nonsense that will undoubtedly be spewed in this thread, it is a well accepted fact that [circumcision does statistically reduce your chance of contracting these diseases](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1477524/), albeit very slightly. It also makes cleaning the penis much easier, which isn't a problem in adulthood but is during infancy, because a newborn baby's foreskin cannot be pulled back for cleaning and, as a father, I can say it isn't uncommon for a baby's fecal matter to get on his penis due to his diaper shifting. As well, there is little if any scientific evidence indicating that circumcision either increases or decreases sensitivity during sex later in life. The chance of complications from newborn circumcision do exist but they are very rare, so rare that there aren't any reliable statistics on it except to say that [complications occurs in less than 0.1% of circumcisions and less than 1% of those are serious complications](http://www.cdc.gov/hiv/prevention/research/malecircumcision/risks.html).

There is a valid argument to be made that a child cannot consent to a circumcision, which makes it ethically dubious, but it is worth note that adult circumcision is not as simple and straight forward as people on reddit seem to think it is. The chance of complications in circumcision increases by orders of magnitude for adults, because an adult penis can grow and shrink a lot more due to erections and temperature than a baby's penis. This increases the chance of the wound being accidentally reopened which can be very serious. Newborns simply don't have this problem, and that's why most parents choose to have their children circumcised upon birth, as to reduce the chance of complications.

In my opinion, circumcision is a lot like vaccines. A child cannot consent to a vaccine, but it's best to give children their vaccines when they're young to reduce the chance of complications. Vaccines hurt and, to someone with little knowledge of them, they seems very weird and cruel, but ultimately they are given for the child's health. There is a risk of complications with all vaccines, but it is very small. You probably don't need most of the vaccines you're given, but it's better to get them and not need them than to not get them and then need them. However, everyone is different, and ultimately the decision to vaccinate or not should be a discussion between parents and their pediatrician.

I'm not saying that everyone should be circumcised or everyone shouldn't. I'm just saying it does have a valid medical purpose and ultimately the decision to do so or not should be left up to parents and doctors. My father is circumcised, I am circumcised, and my son is circumcised. We are all happy, healthy and have never had any issues with our circumcisions. I'm sure there are some people that aren't happy with their circumcisions, and I'm sorry for them, but that doesn't mean they should restrict others from doing so.

So, that's my two cents. I'm sure this will be downvoted to the bottom of the page and plenty of people will comment on it with all sorts of bad science and emotional arguments, but I'm going to comment any further on this issue.

Everyone and their mother has played Minecraft at least once, and I'm no different. Hell, I started in early Beta, found my way through multiple servers and even moderated a couple in the process. After a while though, it was too much of the same and I dropped it altogether.
Around a year later I picked up Terraria with a couple of friends, and boy, was I in for a surprise. Yeah, it's only 2D but so what?! The amount of content jam-packed into this little firecracker of a game is *insane*.

While you progress in this cruel, but mysterious world you begin to wonder how awesome this game can truly be. From magic spells, to high risk, but high rewards dungeons the game is seriously unique in its on regard.

I think the thing that really made me say 'WOW' was the fact that once you think you've hit the 'end game', Terraria truly exposes itself and reveals a whole different game altogether. I think that's what was called Hardcore mode with all the added monsters, craftable items, gear and weapons. I remember when I figured out that the little light motes that dropped from enemies were used to craft wings on your character, I lost it. I stayed up into absurd hours of the morning farming for them just to show them off to my friend the next day when he logged in.

Honestly, Terraria is a very rewarding experience all in its own. I know PC probably has servers and mods that accompany it and probably make it ten times better, but honestly, Vanilla is probably the most fun, as far as I know.

"cls9lkt","Now back to your post.  It may be possible that your son is just too young to be good at letters and such.  I bring this up for Dr. Shaw showed that certain parts of the ADHD brain grow 2 to 3 years slower with ADHD kids age 10 to 17.  Furthermore (I know this from personal experience) it is common for ADHD people as a separate comorbidity speech issues, phonological issues (you know what you want to say but you have problems picking the word, you say the wrong word by accident, or you skip a word)

Now this is not to say you can't help your son you just have to realize a couple things.

1.  He needs a reward to keep him motivated.  1 more correct answer and you get something, he needs to see it and know it will happen in no latter than tonight but preferably within an hour.

2.  He is going to hate this, often ADHD kids when they get *tired* and they are *mentally exhausted* and they have *low blood sugar* they get cranky and their brain just shuts down.  If this happens you need to take a break.  Have him do something with movement, energy, and get his lungs pumping (this allows the frontal lobe to calm down) and the extra movement tells the body it is important to wake up and pay attention and it releases a neurotransmitter called acetylcholine which helps learning and it is known as the distress neurotransmitter.  Make it into a game and do jumping jacks or something.

3.  He is going to need a lot of positive reinforcement, you need to tell him he is awesome when he succeeds even if its a little success for he feels like he is climbing a mountain.  If he does not get this he will eventually internalize the thinking he is broken.

4.  You need to relax and think bigger picture, he needs to enjoy life, you need to enjoy life, you sound stress and I understand kids are hard but they are also awesome but sometimes we get so wound up we do not enjoy the ride.

5.  That even though it sucks to do all these ""drills"" and boring stuff it really does help the brain, but you need to make sure you do not go too fast or you will just spin your wheels.  Language skills are acquired very much in this age so getting it right will help him later on.

I understand personally that you feel you need to do something more for you know how much ADHD stinks for you have it yourself, but sometimes there is only so much you can do.  Thinking yourself a failure is not helping.  And you are not a failure.  If he was born in August he would be the same grade but 5 months older, those 5 months are a tremendous difference on what a normal kid can do in kindergarten and the ability to self regulate and it is even more so if you are ADHD.

This may sound mean and cruel but if your son takes 2 years of kindergarten instead of 1 how much ""damage"" will it do to him?  Not much if you phrase it right, just explain to him that he was a rambunctious kindergartner and he was not able to sit still.  We thought it would be better to have you take another year of kindergarten not because of intelligence just because you were always moving and we just wanted what is best for you and we thought it would be better for you honey.",1415065927,"this may sound mean and cruel but if your son takes 2 years of kindergarten instead of 1 how much ""damage"" will it do to him?","mean and cruel","cruel",NA,FALSE,"mean and cruel","mean",NA,NA,0

"clim6tc","* trivial things...

1. The son has speech difficulties. This was distressing to the couple and reportedly visited new religion to seek assurance (the way the article was written suggest cult) Chinese article suggest Korean related new-religion.

2. The discoverer of the crime - grandmother, actually cannot remember for sure if she open the house with her set of keys or if the door yield opened upon her pull/push. Therefore suspect's escape route cannot be determined; police are not sure whether he walked out of the house from front door or climb out of toilet window. 

3. apart from signs of eating food and drinking tea at the house. The suspect also used the toilet and pooed. (Clearly without flushing) Poo suggest he ate sesame spinach at one point (a cold dish common in Japan).  The poo content suggest he ate this elsewhere, not from the victim's home. 

4. What's missing from the house: a old jacket, 150000 yen in cash. Not sure if money was taken by the suspect as it is not clear where it was stored. Also all the year's ""New Year's card""(greeting postcards) are missing.

5. police had detailed out every single item of clothing and even the perfume the suspect wear at the scene had been identified.(apparently a skateboarder favourite perfume brand ) They even listed out where all the cloth can be purchased and when, giving them a clue where does the suspect shop in Tokyo. But they were all massed produced item and cannot use to pin point where was the suspect. 

6. Discovery of the cloth suggest: Suspect is 175cm tall, waist size 83cm. A right handed person. Probably born between 1965 to 1985. Physically fit and bold but also pay attention to detail. His discarded bloodied clothes were discovered to be neatly folded at the scene.Yet he did not wear gloves for the attack(despite bought a pair of gloves to the house then discarded at the scene) and police have his complete set of prints from various objects he touched in the house. 

7. From the clothing they can determined some were washed with hard water. In Japan all tap water are soft water. This lead to the police to conclude the killer had lived abroad or had been abroad recently. 

8. From the blood shoe print they worked out the killer was wearing a certain pair of Slazenger trainer. But this pair is in Korean sizing. It is probably purchased from Korea or imported, not made/purchased in Japan. Although the exactly same range of trainers are made and sold in Japan as well. 

9. red fluorescent particle discovered in suspect's hip bag indicate suspect is involved in stage prop production. Although owner worked in media and advertisement, there is no indication owner come in contact with these fluorescent particles used for stage prop. The same red fluorescent was also found in the garage but there is no sign of the suspect being in the garage on the day. Police suspect  the killer may be in contact with the family before the attack or had visit the house before the attack.

10. Police had worked out exactly when and which shops in the whole of Tokyo sold the sashimi knife used for the attack. Interestingly On the 29th one was sold in a supermarket in Kichijōji(5.5km away), to a 30 years old male, 170cm in height wearing black jacket. 


11. DNA said he is mixed race, but this cannot rule out if suspect is Korean /Chinese mixed race. DNA shows he has a rare and special sequence of his gene that is present in Chinese/Korean/Japanese. Korean had a higher probability of this gene present, followed by Chinese then Japanese. 

12. Suspect browsed the internet twice. First time he browsed for 5min 18sec trying to link to the theater website for buying ticket. Second time he clicked on links and browsed about the victim's company and school for 4min 16sec then he forced computer shut-down by pulling the power. No suspect's prints on the keyboard, suspect's prints were only found on the mouse.

13. Police: The murder was not about money. The killer was cruel but calm, he might be developing his killing habit.

I think that is most of the interesting nuggets of information. At the moment the police still have a 50 men team assigned to this case. The reward for information is the highest ever (10million yen).  The police also still treat the house as a crime scene and has police guarding the house 24/7. 

The grandmother (81 years old) is now heading a victim's family campaign with other similar unsolved murder cases. They had campaign successfully for Japan government to overturn the law that let robbery killing and murder become nonpunishable if it remain unsolved 25 years. Used to be if crime remain unsolved for 25 years then it became nonpunishable and usually all investigation stop, because there is no point. (Back in the days I read a lot of Japanese detective novel with theme about this rush to solve the crime before the 25 years period and the difficulties they faced as the times goes by...25 years is a long time.)


The father of the murdered owner had recently passed away. The grandmother reportedly said: we still have no answer, he(the father) would have nothing to say to them (the family) when they meet again in the underworld.. he must be embarrassed.

"cl3bmj2","Well lets look at them one by one. Robert came into the Kingdom with 5 spots to fill. He was generous with his enemies and let everyone back into the kingdom peacefully. He didn't really exile many people.

**Barristan** was kept on, as Kingsguard serve for life. He was raised to LC because he was honorable and Barristand the fucking Bold. 

**Jaime** was kept on out of most likely, out of the Lannister political motion. Maybe Cersei slept with Robert to keep him from giving Jaime to the black. Whatever persuaded Robert he kept him on rather than giving him to the black.

**Preston Greenfield** seemed a decent knight atleast with his fighting prowess. No one claimed any different and I think that is more important to note than lack of admiration. He might have been single minded and cruel, but I think one could say the same for Jonothor Darry or even Oswell Whent. Nonetheless probably honored himself on the battlefield and was a supporter to Robert in his war against the crown. Lannisters might have had some sway.

**Mandon Moore** I think was brought to King's Landing to be a member of the Kingsguard by Jon Arryn. Jaime believed him to be the most dangerous member of the Kingsguard after himself, and Barristan has state that he had no friend but his sword and no love but for duty. He was skilled but he never really had friendships. Countless times he did *exactly* what Kingsguard members should. He refused almost to the point of breaking to allow Tyrion and Bronn into Queen Cersei's chambers even after being threatened. He allowed Tyrion in but not Bronn. Although Sansa's sworn sword, he does leave her to protect the King during the riots after Myrcella goes to Dorne. 

He is exactly what you want in a Kingsguard. With this in mind, I'd be surprised to find out if it wasn't truly Joffrey that tried to have him kill Tyrion. And it wasn't necessarily Pod that killed him but the weight of his armor. 

**Arys Oakheart** seems by all to be accounts to be a fine swordsmen and a younger son. He seems a decent fit for the Kingsguard despite his affairs. I wouldn't be surprised if he fought for Robert in his rebellion. The Oakhearts have been known to fight for both sides of wars and they love to fight Dornishmen. 

This leads us to the only two I think are possibly unfit. But there are arguments to be had against that notion. 

**Meryn Trant** might lack intelligence and might be cruel but he almost certainly fought for Robert during his whole rebellion. He could quite possibly have distinguished himself during the war. People base his prowess at arms solely based off his encounter with Syrio Forel. Forel not only uses a different fighting style then what knights in Westeros are used to, but he also lost. I won't say Trant is a great knight nor would he be an amazing fighter. But he survived the riots where Greenfield did not. I assume he is a decent fighter. However, he maybe more useful for a guard (which he is) then a soldier on the battlefield. I assume his low intelligence and his cruelty has been used against him for Cersei to get underneath his skin and make him hers.

**Boros Blount.** Who knows, maybe he fought for Robert's side during the Rebellion and that could have meant something, with his lands located near King's Landing. Maybe he had won renown in tournaments that we are not aware of. My guess, is back when he was elevated to Kingsguard he had somewhat skill of arms. His could definitely be a political move. We know he shows cowardice and we know his health is in decline. But that could be due to his food tasting position and his lack of training. 

Don't get me wrong, I think Boros Blount may be the worse candidate for Kingsguard now, but who knows what he was like directly after the Rebellion. I think Robert was in need of making people happy and maybe this was a political move to show the realm he didn't mind those who fought against him. I really don't know. 

Honestly, I think Kettleblack was a worse choice than any of these. Maybe not Blount, but who knows.

"cke9fg6","Sure, I'll chip in...

Raised in a non-religious family.  Not particularly anti-religious, we have always had close Christian friends; but, have always politely denied the existence of god in our personal beliefs.

For me, it started with the realization that two people of similar circumstances going through a similar crisis can have two very different experiences.  Suppose two people are told that they may have terminal cancer, and that they should seek a second opinion.

The atheist has no assurance of an altruistic god, nor the comfort that things are going according to some sort of sane plan.  Even more devastatingly, his scientific/logical/analytical mind will deny him even the possibility of things getter better because, in all likelihood, they won't.

The theist, particularly the Christian, places his trust in God and doesn't try to understand the situation.  He doesn't know why he is sick; nor, does he know if he will survive.  In fact, he may also have a scientific/logical/analytical mind that also tells him that the chances of survival are slim.  But, when science (in this case, medicine), circumstance, people, or life in general fails you, the theist has one last irrational thing to cling on to -- hope.  Some call it stupid, some call it blind, some even call it false and cruel, but however you characterize it, it is the one thing that will never fail you.  Should you choose to cling on to it, it is the one thing that will get you from day to day, crisis to crisis, tragedy to tragedy in this miserable experience called life.  Hope that you'll get that promotion gets you up in the morning at that miserable job.  Hope that your spouse will have a change of heart gives you the strength to work through an affair.  Hope of remission gives you strength to drag yourself through another session of chemotherapy.  Hope, hope, hope powers the world, because without it, we may as well all keel over and give up.

Needless to say, the Christian doesn't have some sort of magical power that keeps him from getting sick; and prayer is arguably more often unanswered than answered.  If you are going to die, then you are going to die.  But it seems to me that God is screaming that fact at us: you are going to die.  We are all born into this world the same way, and we all leave it the same way.  You take nothing with you.  We are all blind, helpless, hopeless, insignificant maggots and there is nothing we can do that will change the outcome of our lives.  He has made it so. painfully. obvious. that it has never been about the end result, but the journey through life and he has given us the one single tool that can be used to make it through: hope.

What turn me into a theist?  The choice that god has given me: to walk through this horrible journey with him, or to go at it alone.

The outcome is the same.  It has always been the same.  If there is an afterlife, if things are going to get better, if there is some sort of plan -- it isn't something within my power to control.  I was born into this world naked and with only one tool and a really difficult to understand instruction manual.  The only thing I really know how to do with that tool is to cling on to it.",1410344675,"some call it stupid, some call it blind, some even call it false and cruel, but however you characterize it, it is the one thing that will never fail you.","false and cruel","cruel",NA,FALSE,"false and cruel","false",NA,NA,0

I can't say much about Judaism, but as Christianity started to expand as a religion throughout the Mediterranean, leaders would use this as an excuse for conquering and controlling other cultures, specially in Europe.

It's true that the way the religion was spread during the middle ages was cruel, but scientific discoveries were encouraged by the Church as long as it didn't contradict the Dogma.
Today, Christianity can generally be divided in two categories: Missionaries and diocesans. The first ones will go into other lands with the final goal of converting it to Christianity, but in reality the first building raised will always be a hospital, then a school until finally a chapel is built. At this point the people of the land are somewhat converted, so the missionaries take their leave and the diocesans come in to take charge and maintain the religion there. If the conversion of the people fail, then all the buildings are given to the people.

"cjoe9iu","Hey man, sorry to hear you are having such a hard time. High school is rough, and the kids can be really cruel. Its all a big game there over who can be the ""coolest"" and often that comes at other people's expense. 

Here are several tips that could possibly help you:

1. Whatever you do, do it for yourself. Fuck all those other kids who want you to be something you are not. Do what makes you happy, if being in football is that, then keep with it and don't let anyone scare you off. 

2. Don't be a push over. If people are making fun of you, make fun of them back. Don't shy away, even if they threaten you. Young boys only value toughness and will only respect you once you've stood up for yourself. So if they make fun of you, make fun of them. 

3. You are NOT a loser, nobody is. They want you to break down, they want to feel superior to you. Don't let them win. You can be great at something if you practice at it enough. So practice whenever you can. Nobody is good at something when they first start, they have to keep practicing in order to get good at it.

4. If you want to make friends, go out of your way to make others feel good. You know what its like to get bullied, it hurts, so do the opposite. Go around and be kind to others, defend them when they are being made fun, and be a good person for others to look up to.

&gt;I think a better comparison of the usage and evolution of the flag would be comparing it to the word ""nigger"".

&gt;until modern day people morphed it into two things that are to be considered apart of culture. 

It's still a racial slur. Some people use it as a term of endearment, but it's a racial slur a majority of the time. (Clerks 2, porch monkeys, etcetera.) The fact that I have to explain that racial slurs are bad is kinda weakening your argument.

And your comparison doesn't quite make sense. The swastika *had* good connotations before the Nazis. The N-word and the Confederate Flag were made specifically to oppress. Their whole purpose for existence is to disparage an entire race and rebel against a government that was no longer willing to stand by with them treating human beings as property to be owned, traded and abused. It's gonna be a looooooong time to make those symbols of anything else, if they manage to do it at all.


&gt;The reason I think the swastika is viewed in such a bad way is of course because of the Holocaust which, IMO was a worse event than slavery in the new world. 

Nobody is arguing otherwise. Obviously ethnic cleansing and the Holocaust is bad. No freaking duh. Regardless of if they're equally offensive, flying the flag of a treasonous government who provoked a war to keep an obscenely cruel but profitable lifestyle going is going to raise some moral issues. If someone flew a Nazi flag because they're proud of their German heritage, would that not be an issue?

&gt;slavery in the states was something that was happening all over the wold at the time

And now, he's treating you with total disrespect: taking advantage of you,blaming you for his depression and lack of a social life, and not even being honest enough to tell you that he doesn't want to get married because he doesn't love you. He wants to keep on being taken care of by you while he bangs his ""best friend"" on the side behind your back. 

Seriously, dude, it's over. It's been over for a while now.

&gt;How do i tell him I know? Do I tell him?

YES. Tell him that you know he's been cheating on you with this other guy for a long time, and that you're done. It's over. The end. He will cry, he will blame you, he will try and manipulate you into feeling guilty and forgiving him and agreeing to postpone the marriage while he ""works things out"", but it's all a lie, so don't listen to any of it.

&gt;What do I tell my family and friends? We're basically an institution.

That you aren't marrying him because he's cheating on you with his best friend. Listen, if he won't be faithful to you now before you are married, he's sure as fuck not going to be faithful to you after marriage. 

&gt;I love him enough to have an open marriage (open for him)

You think that now, but you would resent the hell out of him for it. You would never be happy being his wife while he chooses another person over you all the time. 

&gt;not while he makes me feel like everything's my fault and he can sleep soundly at night while doing this-that's not love.

Exactly! It's *not* love. Which is why you have to call off the wedding, give him back his ring, and kick him out of your house (assuming the place you live in is yours and not his or a shared rental place). If you marry him when you cannot trust him (and he's made that clear over the last decade!) and he doesn't love you, it will end in a divorce. The question is: do you want to break up with him now, or later, when it will involve lawyers and legal fees and all that crap?

&gt;I'm terrified of being single at my age. It wasn't my plan.

Don't be terrified. You have just as much to offer a man as you did when you were 20, probably even more now because you've got ten more years of life experience and wisdom under your belt. Being 30 doesn't make you unmarriageable or unloveable. Plenty of people find their life partners in their 30s. Don't be scared! 

Life doesn't always follow our plans. Actually, it *often* doesn't! You have to roll with the punches. Which sucks, because getting punched always sucks. But you can do it.

&gt;I'm terrified of losing him and his family which have become like my own.

I know. But this is his doing, not yours. He cheated on you. Twice. He's the one who is being an asshat to you. This is on him, not on you. If his family are worth anything, they will be as disgusted with his unfaithfulness as you are and aren't going to just kick you to the curb.

Notes: 

* Only thing they don't have on there is Lou Malnati's for Chicago pizza, whose pepperoni deep dish (order the butter crust) is my personal favorite in town. You could easily split their smallest size between two people and be satisfied.

* Don't give in to panhandlers on Michigan Ave. It may seem cruel, but many of these people are legitimate scam artists (this was confirmed to me by a Chicago Police veteran). They want your money, not food (you will probably either get yelled at for buying a sandwich or have it thrown at you).

* Hot Doug's is a great place for [exotic sausages](http://www.hotdougs.com/specials.htm) or a good ol' [hot dog](http://www.hotdougs.com/menu.htm), but Doug is permanently closing his doors in October, so if you're curious, go while you can. Be prepared to wait in line for 1-2 hours (best time to go is right when they open or after 2pm). Also, call ahead of time to make sure they are open and not on vacation. Also, it is ***cash only*** - bring $20-30 if you have a big appetite.

* The Lincoln Park Zoo is free and fairly less touristy than downtown

* If you're taking the CTA around town, know the [fares](http://www.transitchicago.com/fares/) and stops for where you're going, and *please* have your fare ready when the bus pulls up. IMPORTANT: Many buses downtown go express once they head north of E Lakeshore Dr. &amp; Michigan Ave. (Deleware will be the last stop before going express), meaning you will no longer be downtown proper.

* If you want to go to the beach and like crowds, go to [North Avenue](https://www.google.com/maps/dir//North+Avenue+Beach/@41.9136167,-87.6244022,17z/data=!4m12!1m3!3m2!1s0x0:0x34ff7ff7af07b521!2sNorth+Avenue+Beach!4m7!1m0!1m5!1m1!1s0x880fd35d9940b6d5:0x34ff7ff7af07b521!2m2!1d-87.625674!2d41.914022) beach, but if you want to avoid the crowds, go north to [Montrose Beach](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Montrose+Beach/@41.9635296,-87.6408382,17z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x880fd3e882263f71:0xcae467b2a6977a0e) (downside: you will want to drive here if that's an option)

"cif03dq","When I was a sophomore in high school, I used to be infatuated with this guy, Max. He was a senior at another high school in the area and hung around with my same group of friends. I used to practically obsess over him. He was the bad boy type with dirty blonde unkempt hair and grungy, raggedy clothes. He had that ever-so-charming ""I don't give a fuck about anything"" type of attitude. He honestly reminded me a lot of Kurt Cobain (probably the biggest reason for my infatuation). I would follow this kid around like a lost puppy. He was always cool with me but never showed any real interest. I would make flirtatious advances and he'd kind of laugh it off or kind of jokingly flirt back. 

That is until one night when we all went out drinking on the docks by a lake in town. It was just us and two of our other friends and as the night progressed said other two friends started making out. They were getting hot and heavy less than three feet away from us. Max and I kind of sat there awkwardly. We were struggling to make conversation and it was painful. Then, out of nowhere, Max kind of shrugs his shoulders and grabs me behind the back of my head and starts kissing me. Of course little old sophomore me is just gleaming with excitement inside. It was all so ""perfect"" in my head! I mean, holy shit, senior hot pants Max was making out with me! Yeah, so perfect, until it progressed on. He hinted that we should go back to his car to be alone and I followed. Once inside what you would expect to happen, happened and all magic was lost.

I was under hot pants Max in the backseat of his car watching him thrust away as my head hit the freaking door handle above me and I felt *absolutely nothing*. If anything, it was a slight tickle here and there but other than that...nothing. I was mortified with what to do. I didn't want to fake anything but God knows (metaphorically) that I wasn't in any kind of mood at this point. It was like being boomeranged against bones and plastic car door back and forth with not even a hint of pleasure. So many thoughts were running through my head like *am I just really loose?*, *is he even really in me right now?*, *what the hell is happening!?*

Finally, he finished, and when he pulled out I saw what I was working with. I don't mean to be cruel but hot pants Max's business was so tiny in its ""coming down"" state that it literally resembled a deformed, deflating thumb. I felt slightly relieved that my vag wasn't actually the size of the Grand Canyon but I was also confused because my obsessive attraction for Max kind of kaputzed right then and there. 

Now, to be fair, this small schlong incident lead to more than just shallow repulsion. It allowed me to see the superficial reasons why I had liked Max so obsessively. Had we actually had a mutual good romp that night, I'm not sure that my infatuation would have ceased. And the thing is, Max was an asshole. I never saw it before but holy shit, hot pants Max was a raging buttplug. He wasn't ""cool"" and a ""bad boy"" he was stupid, rude, and elitist. He was a thieving, public defacing, going to be held back a year, teenage angst and anarchy, friend humiliating, know-it-all who was just a complete fucking dick. After our incident he kept trying to use me as a back-up hookup. He would prey upon me on nights where other chicks went home early or turned him down and, worse of all, he would deny to any of his friends that he even *slightly* ""liked me like that"". Real cool, Max.

I didn't take any of his shit though and every time he made a pathetic advance at me I would just stare him down callously and walk away. After a few months I started distancing myself from that friend group just to keep away from sad pants Max. And in hindsight, I thank my lucky stars everyday that he had a tiny penis because, without it, I'm not sure I would have realized my own worth and especially bad taste in boys.

You've missed a crucial distinction(s) here: who the enemy is/ what the alternative to fighting is/ the broader ideological context.

The Soviets were fighting an alien nation bent on their annihilation (and they had an effective system of brutally punishing people who failed to fight)

The Wermacht are a bad example, Their core was an incredibly professional high quality military, and they were built up with people who had a huge amount of faith in the Nazi government, there was no legitimacy deficit.

I believe the IJA is similar to the Wermacht here, can't speak to your other examples.

It's also easier to build a decent military if it's in the service of a decent government.

"ci6d1h2","&gt;However, most jobs are service jobs and the people doing them are easily replaceable. 

Then all service jobs would be earning minimum wage and not a cent more. Good employees have value to employers, and they would rather keep them than hire an unknown new one.

How much more? When he gets raise won't it still not be ""enough"" and won't you still be arguing for more?

"ci5uzse","Soldiers fight for their mates and their leadership. If there is no bond between individual men and little respect or trust between them and the leadership then you have a poor performing military.

However if you look through history you see that well, or poor, performing militaries have little relation on the higher political leadership. At the beginning of the war the Red Army was neutered by removal of competent leadership, had poor training, and their performance was abysmal. The Soviet Army by the end of WWII was an excellent fighting machine that easily defeated the Japanese in Manchuria for example. Many knew that the leadership was bad, and the system corrupt and cruel. But they fought for their country masterfully anyway. This could be said of the Wehrmacht, Mongols, Imperial Japanese military, and even the Iraqi Army in the Iran-Iraq war. 

The later stalemate and strategic blunders are well known in the Iran-Iraq conflict. But we must remember that the Iraqi army stayed together and fought hard in some really serious fighting that took place over the better part of a decade. There was a discipline and trust that bound the men together and made them hold their positions. Later in the Gulf War there were only mass surrenders (by regular conscript units) when they had been bombed heavily for long time. Even then there were plenty of units that fought on. The Republican Guard being an obvious example. 

All of this is note worthy because of the significantly lesser opposition that ISIS presents today. A military that fought waves of Iranian infantry would certainly have been able to stand firm against a few guys in trucks. And the legitimacy of Saddam is far less than Maliki. Especially when you see that much of the IA today is Shiite dominated and Maliki is Shiite, and under Saddam millions of Iraq Shiite men (of Arab ethnicity) fought against Iran. 

In the US we tend to think of fighting for democracy, of a political system that is fair and that you can believe in. But if you talk to people who fight you'll see that it is far less about Captain America (or whoever) then it is about the very basic human social bonds that grip you at a really deep and powerful level. The men of the IA today probably care very little about who has majority control in parliament, and care very deeply when they see their fellow soldiers and leaders fleeing the battlefield leaving them behind. 

I think that one of our most fundamental mistakes when looking at (or even leading) foreign nations is that we fail to understand that the geography and weapons do not matter nearly as much as the people involved. The human element is the most important aspect of war and nations, and we have completely ignored it. With predictably horrible consequences.

"chjghlt","No matter the circumstance, if have to say I vote for Ramsay. The joker may seem like a genius in the batman movies, but based on their back stories, I honestly think he's more human than Ramsay. He's also already a broken man, and as such, I have little faith he could handle the vicious physical and mental anguish of dealing with someone like Ramsay. 

The joker had a wife and kid(s) if I recall. He lost it because they died and he had an accident at a chemical plant. You can sympathize with him, he was normal once. Ramsay was born bad. His own father even says it several times in the books.  His father isn't exactly the most caring man either. Don't forget his famous line which he says to his son ""don't make me rue the day I raped your mother""... Clearly there was nothing normal about Ramsay from the beginning. 

Although the Joker is a mad genius, I think Ramsay could figure out what to say/do to push the joker over the borderline into complete madness. He clearly likes to play games with men's sanity and has no problem breaking Reek- for absolutely no reason at all.  Reek was a relatively sane young man before he was turned into Reek by extreme physical and mental torture. Ramsay also wouldn't have the moral dilemmas that batman has to face, so I'm not really sure he would even play the Joker's games. If the joker called Ramsay and told him to pick a boat to explode, he would probably immediately pick the civilian boat and hang up, then never think of it again. He doesn't love anyone or anything, so the Joker couldn't kidnap his fiancée and blow her up. Ramsay chopped pieces of Reek off and mailed them to his sister. Clearly he doesn't have a sense of right and wrong the way the Joker does. I think Ramsay would lose his patience with the Joker very quickly and separate his head from his body. 

Additionally, I don't think the Joker is in the physical condition that Ramsay is in. If Ramsay releases the hounds, Joker dies. In hand to hand combat, Joker dies. Ramsay is described as fearless and ferocious. Unless the Joker is going to blow up the entire Dreadfort, he's not going to kill Ramsay. And if you try to drop bombs on the Dreadfort, you're going to have to deal with Roose. 

All of the Boltons are mentioned to be cruel and cunning. It is part of their nature.  Ramsay is just especially cruel.  But Roose would defend his family sooner than let the Joker mess with the Boltons. Where the Joker has to work alone, Ramsay basically has an army behind him. Ramsay wouldn't even have to fetch the Joker himself to bring him to the Dreadfort to be flayed.

When you open a strongbox, get away from it as fast as possible. Like ideally so you're almost a screen away (can still see most of the monsters).

"cha136z","I've always found appeals to nature (especially those who do not result in objective benefit for the people in question) strange. Look, gay sex is normal because it's found in animals. Slavery is fine because ants like to do it. Rape is okay too since dolphins love it, and what kind of person hates dolphins? You'd do well to remember that the Mother Nature is the mother of all bitches. She's a cruel, but fair cunt. 

The very ability to control the inherent animalistic nature of yourself is the very fact that makes you different from animals. Technological progress and cultural achievements are just side effect of that peculiarity of human existence.

Now, first thing you do is start to doubt the idea of social progress and divorce it from the concept of technological progress. Social progress is essentially illusion, and the very word ""progress"" is very misguiding, especially in the current context. Why is exactly woman in a garage more ""progressive"" than a woman in the kitchen? But this topic has a quite few articles devoted to it in reactosphere - [this article covers neatly on what exactly the social progress wants to destroy](http://www.xenosystems.net/discrimination/) and [this covers progress more in depth](http://anarchopapist.wordpress.com/2013/11/15/the-theory-of-demotist-singularity/). But for now, even if you don't buy the thought of social progress being a stupid concept, just humor me for a second.

The very thing that makes human beings human is their ability to suspend actions which are facilitated by their animal instincts. We don't kill like the animals do. We don't rape like the animals do. We don't enslave anymore. It is true that we gave a part of our freedom in return for a stable society. That's simply how it is, degrees of freedom need to be sacrificed for order to appear. Thermodynamics.

One of the ideas on TRP and RPW is the notion that sexual liberty must be sacrificed. You might find this tyrannical at first, but that's exactly what the idea institution of marriage is - you sacrifice your sexual liberty and in return you get a steady supply of sex. Rest of society likes that since you are removed as a competitor and this contract is arguably better to raise offspring - more meat for the meat grinder is always good. 

This form of check on sexual liberty is what I'd call legal check - even though cheating stopped being criminally penalized, institution of marriage is still a legal one.

Other form of check on sexual liberty comes from biological natures of men and women - men are polygamous (the more the better) while women are hypergamous (the better the better). Hypergamy might give you an illusion of monogamy, but if what's considered best is inconsistent, then hypergamy turns into polyandry.

What Red Pill Women says on this :  

&gt;Male ephebephiliac polygyny--A mouthful. Let's unpack it. If Men existed in a universe where fully formed, hot 16-18 year old girls with long, silky hair and .7 hip-waist ratios grew out of the ground without agency, wants, needs and desires of their own and without families to care for and protect them, men would kill each other to collect as many of them as possible--replacing them with new ones as the older ones cycled out.

&gt;Female hypergamy--If 6'2"" 34 year old I-Banker millionaires grew out of the ground fully formed with no agency, wants, needs and desires of their own and no families to look after their interests--25 women would each chase and even consent to share the one that managed to make $1000001, while keeping a weather eye on any one who manages to make $1000002 as an option for jumping ship.

It is in society's best interest to keep you ignorant of this - that's why the bombard you with the BP ideas, they want you to commit. That's why the idea of love is so prevalent today - there's no legal net benefit for marriage and love is the perfect force which always conquers. That's why in the past, slut shaming was serious and seriously done by other women. That's why in the past, a man without a family was vilified. 

When the society simultanously gives one gender incentive to break away from the sexual responsibilities and thus sexually ""liberate"" them (as what the West tries to do with gurrl power and slut shaming) while bombarding other gender with the idea that the liberated gender is still complying with their responsibilities, you have a problem. Monogamous female doesn't exist naturally, she is either made by societal pressure or a hypergamous woman whose main asset is slowly decreasing. When this societal pressure is gone, women will comply with their true animalistic nature - fuck the best and get the provision from the rest. If the roles were reversed, and men lost their societal pressure, they would fuck everything and never stop to commit. 
Some women harbor the delusion that if they go with their nature, men will either act according to female nature (they won't since men and women are at least neurologically different) or still go with the societal propaganda - this societal propaganda will be called blue pill for the sake of brevity. 

They won't. TRP, Manosphere, everything PUA, MRA, MGTOW is a sign of this . It's not something that suddenly springed out since men have it oh so bad, men had it worse in the past. It's something that came as a reaction towards sexual revolution of women and feminist dominance, movements made up mainly by men who are dissapointed that their average woman isn't a loving Disney princess what the TV promised them. And it's not some violent movement - it's a simple return to the animalistic nature of a man.  BP cannot sustain itself indefinitely (you know why this is, it's in your post) , every man will become RP (more animalistic in his sexual choice) so two things can happen

* 1) This is ""return"" to nature is with net benefit and we profit from this. Hooray.

* 2) Men start despairing, start giving no fucks, women suddenly understand the shit they're in.

Number 1 I doubt. If nature is so good, why is the institution of marriage so prevalent in every civilization.
Number 2 I support because I've actually seen it happen. Confronted with biological realities and held hostage (actually not *held*, but rather *ignored*) by men who no longer care about women as beings but as live fleshlights (funny how feminism fighting against objectification only increases it) they will stop and return to well tested and ever true traditional gender roles and they will come back with the force of thousand exploding suns. There won't be any cries for feminist equality, women will start ""celebrating diversity"" and acting submissive  - because that's what boys like. A hot woman who knows how to cook is many times more attractive than a hot woman whose main culinary expertise is making Hot Pockets.  There'll be more slut shaming from women and less slutting from young women.   You're in the age right before it happens, in the height of sexual decadence of modern age. You've got two options :

* 1) Keep BP ideals and try to find Red Pill Woman who knows what parts of her nature she shouldn't indulge in

* 2) Ride the tiger of modern age and do your best to make the rest of society see the logical conclusion of womyn liberated society.

The former is I suppose unattractive to you. The latter is more appealing. But always remember the role of culture - we like sex, but culture decides how to get it. A woman raised in casual sex culture will see no fault in casual sex and be blind to how it impacts those around her. You too impact this culture. If you want to help the tiger get to his final destination ( a place where he started off first - in tradition), do so.

"ch9tsg3","&gt; Interesting, I hadn't considered the legal implications. But a few counterarguments: (1) Tyrion obviously wasn't the heir, so less concern on that front;

No way.  Even if he wasn't the current heir according to Westorsi law and tradition, Tyrion is in the line of succession and that creates a transmittable claim.  It's actually a huge big deal.  

But by my recollection Tyrion is in fact the heir to Casterly Rock when this incident happens.  

&gt; (2) Tywin has a history of handling whores with cruel but non-lethal methods. 

Actually Tywin has a history of handling potential threats to House Lannister with as much force as necessary to utterly remove the threat and if he errs in this it's on the side of more force than necessary.  

Tysha is a risk to House Lannister and the only way to completely remove that risk is to kill her.  

You're entirely off base here anyway.  What has his treatment of whores got to do with Tysha and his father's mistress?  Neither of these people were prostitutes.

&gt; He orders his father's mistress to depart naked through the town, but lets her depart. 

This is entirely irrelevant to the case at hand.  The entire crux of the matter is that Tysha constitutes a very real dynastic risk.  Tywin doesn't tolerate those kinds of risks; he gets rid of them.  His father's mistress presented no dynastic risk whatsoever.  She's just a mistress not a wife.

&gt; And he swears he'll kill ""the next"" prostitute found in Tyrion's bed -- but he doesn't, he beds Shae instead, and in the Tower of the Hand at that; and 

And again an inappropriate example because she doesn't represent any dynastic risk; she's not a danger to House Lannister.  And further we don't know what he meant to do with her that night (for all we know she was in for a fatal encounter one way or another) and we certainly cannot conclude that he wouldn't have killed her to teach Tyrion a lesson if she'd come to public attention while Tyrion was free.

&gt; Has Tywin ever killed anyone in secret or silence? 

As you yourself point to he does conspire in the Red Wedding event so he is entirely willing to not take credit for his role in eliminating problems with fatal measures. 

I feel like these are some really flimsy straws you're grasping at here. 

Tysha poses a risk being a possible source of future trouble for House Lannister, including the potential for a dynastic risk.  Tywin doesn't tolerate that kind of risk.  The only way to eliminate the risk is to kill Tysha.  Do you really think that some scruple about not killing whores (?) or some inability to not take credit for murders (even though we know he happily went without credit for the Red Wedding) would render him unable to eliminate the risk or willing to tolerate it?

"ch52ff4","**If you were to write a 5-word phrase or sentence on Catelyn, what would it be?**
&gt;Fierce mother wolf loses all.

**Do you like Catelyn? Why or why not?**
&gt;I love Cat.  She's unequivocally my favorite character, and the one I identify with the most.  Does she make mistakes? Yes, but no one is perfect.  In a land of murder and treason and backstabbing, she is largely honorable and loving.  I will point out that she also gave King Robb excellent advisement, and was a fairly effective ambassador.

**Do you think that Catelyn is a good mother?**
&gt;Aside from her treatment of Jon Snow, I think she's an excellent mother.  She goes to great lengths to serve and protect her husband and children without crossing into the realm of lawlessness and corruption, as we see with Cersei or even Olenna.

&gt;Regarding Jon, here are my thoughts from another thread:
&gt;*There are characters in this series who make far more repugnant choices than not wanting to raise their husband's bastard.*

&gt;*Catelyn is ultimately trying to protect her children (their claim to Winterfell) and her marriage (that Ned is more loyal to her than to some woman he will not even disclose). Jaime and Cersei outright kill people in order to save themselves and their children. Randall Tarly gives his son and heir the choice of death or taking the black, and openly mocks and abuses him. And yet Cat is seen as the bad mother.
Should Cat forgive Ned and embrace Jon? Maybe if she were a saint. There is no character in this book who is that noble. If anything, we are faulting Catelyn for Ned's sins. According to the account we hear above, Ned leaves his newly wed and bedded wife to wage war. While she is at home pregnant and laboring, he is finding solace in another woman's bed. And she forgives him for that. She grows to love him, and strives to serve him. He fathers a bastard while he is away, and Cat fully expects him to provide for that child. That is never questioned. Instead, he brings the child to her house, for her to raise. In this world, where names and titles mean everything, this is a slap in the face to his wife and his children. It's not being penitent for fathering a bastard, it's shoving his dutiful wife's nose in it. Furthermore, he will not confess who Jon's mother is, and makes Cat fearful of his anger the only time she dares ask. Where is the love and respect for his wife there? Ned leaves to take a job in King's Landing (albeit at her recommendation), and takes Cat's most beloved children with him, even selling his eldest daughter off to a prince who we already have inclinations to believe is arrogant, disrespectful, and cruel. But not only that, he also expects Cat to continue to raise Jon, his own bastard, while he's gone.*

&gt;*Jon never should have been there in the first place, but she was allowing it out of devotion to her Lord husband. Why is it Cat's problem to figure out where to send him now? Jon was raised far better than most bastards, with his true-born siblings and father, in a castle, with education from a Maester and marshal training from a knight. If all he was deprived of is love from a mother, should we really feel sorry for him, or blame Cat? That is well beyond her job description, and Ned is being disrespectful, unreasonable, and almost spiteful to suggest otherwise.*

**Was Catelyn right to take Tyrion hostage at the Inn at the Crossroads in retribution for his alleged attempted murder of Bran Stark?**
&gt;Every time this comes up, I have to remind people that she took Tyrion out of self defense.  When he walked into the room, she prayed that he wouldn't see her.  I think if she could have escaped unnoticed, she would have.  If she had simply wanted to capture or kill Tyrion, he had been to the wall and back, the whole time in her lands, and she could have had him seized at any moment.  She was undercover, precicsely because she didn't want the Lannisters to know what she was up to until she had more evidence, but Tyrion's recognition forced her hand.  It was a hurried decision, but her other choice was to let him go back to King's Landing with the knowledge he had, which would have put Ned and her girls in danger.  Also, if she had just meant to kill him, why would she have bothered to take him all the way to the Vale for trial, and then actually set him free when he was found innocent?  She could have offed him as soon as they left the inn.  She honestly thought what she was doing was justice, and she was acting in good faith on the best information she had.

&gt;*The dwarf had not so much as glanced toward the far end of the room, and Catelyn was thinking how grateful she was for the crowded benches between them when suddenly Marillion bounded to his feet. “My lord of Lannister!” he called out. “I would be pleased to entertain you while you eat. Let me sing you the lay of your father’s great victory at King’s Landing!”*

&gt;*“Nothing would be more likely to ruin my supper,” the dwarf said dryly. His mismatched eyes considered the singer briefly, started to move away … and found Catelyn. He looked at her for a moment, puzzled. She turned her face away, but too late. The dwarf was smiling. “Lady Stark, what an unexpected pleasure,” he said. “I was sorry to miss you at Winterfell.”* 

&gt;*Marillion gaped at her, confusion giving way to chagrin as Catelyn rose slowly to her feet. She heard Ser Rodrik curse. If only the man had lingered at the Wall, she thought, if only … “Lady … Stark?” Masha Heddle said thickly.* 

&gt;*“I was still Catelyn Tully the last time I bedded here,” she told the innkeep. She could hear the muttering, feel the eyes upon her. Catelyn glanced around the room, at the faces of the knights and sworn swords, and took a deep breath to slow the frantic beating of her heart. Did she dare take the risk? There was no time to think it through, only the moment and the sound of her own voice ringing in her ears. “You in the corner,” she said to an older man she had not noticed until now . “Is that the black bat of Harrenhal I see embroidered on your surcoat, ser?”*

**Was Catelyn right to free Jaime Lannister from his captivity at Riverrun?**
&gt;I completely understand why she did it, but that doesn't change the fact that it was technically treason.  She should have worked harder to change Robb's mind about it instead of taking matters into her own hands.  But, she was acting on the grief of learning that Bran and Rickon were dead.  You have to remember, her job is wife and mother.  Her husband is murdered, and now her children are being slaughtered in her own castle.  She probably feels like she's not doing such a great job, and that spurs her to do *anything* to get her girls out of King's Landing.  And to her credit, Jaime actually acts in good faith on his promise.  He genuinely believes Arya is dead, and he sends Brienne after Sansa with his own sword.  Unfortunately for them, Lady Stoneheart didn't get that memo.

**Do you think that Catelyn Stark is tragic and sympathetic character?**
&gt;Completely. I don't think there's anything, including her treatment of Jon Snow, that shows that she was a cruel or mentally incompetent character.  She's had a pretty good life, and the first three books just happen to document when it all falls apart.

**How do you feel about Michelle Fairley’s portrayal of Catelyn Stark in the show?**
&gt;She's perfect; she is Cat.  My only qualms are with some of the added scenes or dialogue, such as when Cat confesses to Talisa that she wished for Jon to die as a child.  Also, I have a personal beef with their aging up the characters.  Cat in the books was closer to my age, and in the show she's my mom's age.

**I have no opinion about Lady Stoneheart yet. We don't know enough about her motives or thought process.  However, I can't wait until they show her on the show and I can begin planning my Halloween costume.  My husband is going to dress as Wolf-head Robb.**

**Will Catelyn and Littlefinger ever cross paths again?**
&gt; I mean, that would be ""Will Lady Stoneheart and Littlefinger ever cross paths again?""  I am intrigued by the theories that put them in the same place.  However, I don't want Arya or Sansa to have to come across their mother in this way.  And because I'd really rather have Stoneheart go after the Freys and Lannisters and maybe wreck a wedding, I think that's a more powerful way for her to get revenge and go out with a bang.  I don't know why she'd run into Littlefinger in order to accomplish that, so I'll say no.",1398783507,"ned leaves to take a job in king's landing (albeit at her recommendation), and takes cat's most beloved children with him, even selling his eldest daughter off to a prince who we already have inclinations to believe is arrogant, disrespectful, and cruel.","disrespectful, and cruel","cruel",NA,TRUE,"disrespectful , and cruel","disrespectful",NA,NA,0

Helping them still makes him guilty of killing. He could have tried to prevent it. He didn't. He did not directly kill them, no, but in his inaction he caused those deaths. 3,000 people. He deserved to die.

&gt;Actually, many would disagree with you. It is not that the constitution is giving you those rights, it is specifically instructing the government to not violate those rights. The first amendment doesn't create a freedom of speech, it plainly says that congress shall make no law abridging it.

Solid point, hadn't considered that. I believe that means I disagree with the constitution. I will have to think on that some before I respond.

&gt;It would be cheap and easy to kill accused murderers and rapists too.

But they are can be caught by US forces without much harm to them. They usually kill with a motive, or with some specific weapon. Terrorists often get hold of military style equipment, like AK-47s, grenades and rockets. Things US civilians have little access to. Sometimes even anti-aircraft. We know they can make IEDs very cheap and easily. They have used all these tactics before, making getting them much more dangerous. Do you think we would arrest, rather than shoot, a similarly armed man in the US? I bet we would, because a man who plants IED for the cops to fun into, would certainly pull the trigger on his AR/AK. So when he is waving that thing around, he would be shot. 

&gt;You seriously think we can stop terrorism by bombing other countries? You don't think the ""collateral damage"" creates more terrorists?

Absolutely. Terrorists and their funding networks depend on funds from  governments and their people. Make it too dangerous to fund them, it will dry up. Would you risk your family to send a few bucks to Al-Qaeda, knowing the US might put a 2,000 lb JDAM through your window? I'm willing to bet not. No terrorists came out of the bombings in Germany in WWII I think because we demonstrated the willingness to kill thousands of people to win. If we threatened to do what we did to Germnay in WWII to any country who supports terrorism, I believe the funding would dry up. If not, we take out the country. Gruesome, maybe cruel, but entirely effective. 

&gt;This is probably my biggest issue with the entire thing. You admit that if we had a trial and had to actually present evidence beyond a reasonable doubt that he actually committed crimes he would only be imprisoned. Yet somehow, it becomes ok for us to kill him if we skip the actual evidence phase because we decide it is too hard.

I agree that this would happen, but it isn't what should happen. I believe he should be put to death, and the death penalty should be expanded to include all terrorists, murders(first degree), treasoners and rapists.

To number one: Yes, the role of women is exagerated. On the other hand, compare to other civilizations, we know very little about vikings. All we know is from their enemies (or rather victims) and stuff written down few centuries later. In most civilizations reliant on raids women did have much more freedom and often took part in fighting (mainly because men not allways returned) In reality there was likely no Lagertha, but who knows. The shows is more focused on sagas anyway. There, Lagertha commands fleet, so they just made it happend.

More interesting thing is that a lot of people keep using frases like ""made up modern feminist version"". Is it necessary? This way it sounds more like ""hey I have some kind inferiority Complex"".


To the point three: Honestly, I don't think vikings are shown any more favorable than christians. Both are shown superstitious and cruel, but the camera focuses on vikings. You simply know them better and that makes the ilusion that they are percieved more favorably. Lets call it mild stockholm syndrome. I don't know how apostates were dealt with, but don't forget Athelstan took part in the raid on holy place and torturing to death local bishop. Sounds like special case to me.



Generaly it is not really about showing christians bad or stupid compare to non-believers. Its just about contrast between todays values and values back than. You see them bad, they are normal. Hero is usually shown modern, to be likeable to modern audience. It is more a case that some christians expect them to be treated better because they are christians. But the christians back then were simple, superstitious, cruel and mostly uneducated, just like everyone else.

"cgm9i1f","It's called ""don't burn your bridges,"" and frankly it doesn't surprise me that many on reddit don't know much about professional courtesy.

Good employees give their employer some sort of warning that they are leaving.  Two weeks is considered the standard amount of time, and if you are in a key position, you generally want to give an even earlier warning.  Part of it is simply being nice to your co-workers, so they can plan out in advance.  God forbid you try to do something just for the sake of being decent to your fellow human beings.   And some of it is that it's a small world; you never know if you basically give your old employer the finger, how word could get around to the new dream job you apply to five years down the road.

Good employers might not give a big heads up, but they generally give severance (often 2 weeks of pay after your are fired).   I got laid off when my office got cut in half, and all of us got one week warning to finish anything we were working on (I was pretty up-to-date so I literally came into the office for like one afternoon the whole week), THEN we all got 4 weeks severance with benefits, AND they offered help finding new jobs.  Plus the obvious stuff like if we had leftover vacation they paid us for that too.  Why did they do all this stuff which for the most part was not legally required?  Because they weren't assholes and they didn't want to look bad for prospective new hires.

An additional factor to consider is that when an employee voluntarily quits, there is unlikely to be any bad blood.  The company might be unhappy to lose a good employee, but for all reddit loves to hate on big corporations, the vast vast majority are not petty enough to seek vengeance against a well-behaved employee.  But when people are fired, it's often considered best to get them out the door as quickly as possible.  At best they might be resentful and cause discontent, at worst they may make some petty attempt to sabotage something.  I once had a co-worker find out he was getting fired. And he pretty much stopped doing any work, came in just for lunch, and when he was in the office he just screwed around and flirted with the client's cute young women.

The only mention of slavery within the Constitution was the passage that ended the important of foreign slaves in 1808.

&gt;Our Constitution, has been stretched, to include things the founding fathers could have no conception of. 

That's the exact purpose of the elastic clause.  The founders realized that future societies would evolve, so they left many things open for change.  Surely the second amendment meant only muskets and bayonets when it was written, because that was what was available to the founders.  But that law now covers assault rifles, grenades, and many things that have been invented since.

Do you agree that the Constitution should be left open for interpretation?  For example, with the eighth amendment, and the use of ""cruel and unusual punishment.""  What constitutes a cruel punishment?  How about an unusual punishment?  Does the punishment need to be both cruel AND unusual to be unconstitutional, or could a cruel but usual punishment (say, an inordinately long jail sentence) or an uncruel but unusual punishment (say, becoming the judge's butler for a year) be considered unconstitutional as well?  This is why the elastic clause was put into place: each individual case must be considered on its own, and there can be no definitive definition of what constitutes ""cruel and unusual punishments,"" or ""well-regulated militia,"" or a number of other constitutional phrases.

&gt; But at the same time, the definition of Privacy, something Not addressed in the Constitution, has also been stretched.

"cg7revz","Don't eat your brother in a fit of rage and don't establish a totalitarian police state.

But really, i don't think there was a ""moral"" to it. The story of Lemonhope is simply an exploration of a completely different type of hero. A truly reluctant one. 

Under everything, Lemonhope is... well, selfish, even at the expense of other people (at first). He's not without a soul though, as the only reasin he saves the Lemon children is out of a sense of obligation and guilt.

Despite this, Lemonhope, unlike Finn, does not find fullfillment in rescuing or helping the less fortunate, rather, he find fullfillment from shutting himself away from obligation or difficulty in search of a life of easy freedom.

In that way, he's unlikeable, as he devotes his entire life to selfish desires of mind and flesh. That being true freedom, but only after one 
settles all his debts.

This is what made Lemonhope such a good character, even if he did appear for only three episode. He was the complete opposite from Finn and completely opposite from what people see as a hero.

He was selfish, childish, spoiled, greedy and realy doesn't care about anyone but himself and avoids obligation simply to stop himself from feeling any sort of guilt or duty towards anyone.

If he was just another run of the mill hero, we'd have no conflict and *Lemonhope I* and *II* would not have been as good as they were, nor would it's ending be as amazing as it was.

In short, i don't think the story was meant as a tale of morals. Sure, there were some pretty heavy morals, the main one being:

""True freedom willy only come to you after you square your debts with society"" which when you think about it is a very dark, cruel but also pragmatic and realistic moral.

However, i saw the episodes as a brilliant study into an unlikely and reluctant hero, and a study into morals, duty and obligation, guilt, the need and achievement of freedom.

"cg3l9l6","Kairngorth, Vanquisher of the Dead, loved new travellers. The regulars here at the tavern were used to everything by now, but the look on the faces of those who walked through his modest little door for the first time was hilarious.

Kairngorth, Vanquisher of the Dead, would stand a short distance from the door, fully covered in the armour of the Lich-Lords. It was dark, heavy, plate metal, which obscured every part of his body. Recently Kairngorth, Vanquisher of the Dead, had infused it with the souls of the men he had conquered, which took form as whisps of shadow that floated around the armour. This addition to his appearance only made the looks of first-timers even more amusing.

The tavern was quite unsuspecting in many ways. It slid in to the bustling central hub of the city, inconspicuous, and very much unheard of. Standing outside the tavern was one of Kairngorth's, Vanquisher of the Dead, thralls, a stout wight named Carl. Carl had never fit in with many of the other wraith's at the barrow - but Kairngorth, Vanquisher of the Dead, had sympathised with him, and recruited him to direct people to his tavern.

And so Carl would stand outside, day and night, for after all wights have no need of food or drink or sleep. And Carl would hold up a dark sign which was black as night, for all things a Lich owns must be black as night, to inspire fear and look badass. On this sign was scrawled in bone white writing: ""Rahnig-Zhul"". The name didn't really mean anything though. Kairngorth, Vanquisher of the Dead, had simply thought it sounded appropriately Lich-y, for every name a lich must have associated with him must be appropriately Lich-y. With the exception of Carl, of course.

It hadn't taken long before everybody across Garenthal had heard of Kairngorth, Vanquisher of the Dead, and Raznig-Zhul. After all, not many Lich's were around these days, and there are even fewer Lich's around who can tolerate the puny mortals that inhabit the world of the living. This made Kairngorth, Vanquisher of the Dead, quite exceptional really.

After the moment of entrepreneurial genius that inspired Kairngorth, Vanquisher of the Dead, to buy the land for the tavern, he had quickly set about acquiring builders for building, brewers for brewing, cooks for cooking, and Carl for moderate amusement. It seemed everybody these days thought that wights were thin, harsh and cruel, but Carl was plump and happy. He was the epitome of a jovial soul.

Kairngorth, Vanquisher of the Dead, was a rich Lich from his many crusades against the Demon Tribes from the Realm of the Banished, however whenever he asked somebody to do something, they would do it, free of charge. The Lich was upset by this - his workers refusing his money for their services made him feel like some form of a slave master. Granted, he had enslaved the souls of thousands once, but he was trying to turn over a new page.

Manning the bar was a hairy old goblin named Gwyneth. Goblins are a naturally hideous race, and when one is considered ""fuck-ugly"" by one's own race, who are considered ""fuck-ugly"" by the rest of the people's of the world, one has a tendency to seek another race who will be more appreciative of one's inner beauty. 

Kairngorth, Vanquisher of the Dead, did not have this form of appreciation for Gwyneth, however he did appreciate that she could keep tenants in line and tell a mean one-liner. After noting Kairngorth, Vanquisher of the Dead, himself, tenants would often notice Gwyneth next. Not many goblins hang around these parts, and not many things anywhere have boils as large as Gwyneth's. A truly magnificent advocate for surgery, it was. The thing was so large and hideous that Carl had whimpered like a little girl when he first saw it, and he had hidden in the realm of the dead for 3 weeks before Kairngorth, Vanquisher of the Dead, could convince him that the boil wouldn't hurt him.

Kairngorth's, Vanquisher of the Dead, rivals around town would whisper that Gwyneth would squeeze pus out of her nose and into the beer, in a hope that it would bring more customers from Raznig-Zhul to their establishments. So Kairngorth, Vanquisher of the Dead, had sent shadow-demons to cut the throats of these rivals, in full knowledge that it would bring more customers. But he didn't do it for the customers, he did it because he felt quite sorry for Gwyneth. Seriously, she grew a meaner beard than he could!

With it's already increasing popularity, the tavern had grown massively. Kairngorth, Vanquisher of the Dead, bought the building on the left, and had taken the building on the right when Carl won it off the landlord in a game of ice dice. Yet Raznig-Zhul was still crowded. Kairngorth, Vanquisher of the Dead, concluded that the best course of action was to build far into the ground, where the lower-class customers would stay, whilst he also built high into the sky, offering exquisite cuisine to the upper classes who would stay there.

There was, however, one issue with this. An issue which prompted a story which Kairngorth, Vanquisher of the Dead, vowed he would remember until the day he died (only later Kairngorth, Vanquisher of the Dead, had realised that this was a bit of a queer promise, given that a Lich couldn't actually die).

One day, across the city, in the Mage's Tower, the great Blood Sorcerers of the realm had attempted to summon the God of Blood and War, Sharenath. These mages believed Sharenath could give them guidance in their current war. That was the biggest problem with humans, Kairngorth, Vanquisher of the Dead, had mused. They were always at war with someone or another. It was perhaps hypocritical coming from someone who had spent the last few thousands of years waging war, however Kairngorth, Vanquisher of the Dead, believed he was a changed Lich.

When Sharenath came down from the heavens, opening up the sky and turning it red as blood, the God of Blood and War looked down over the city, trying to find the puny humans who had summoned him. Reasoning that only mages would dare to bring him down from his Accursed Throne amongst the stars, Sharenath flew down from the heavens, the great wings of a dragon flapping from his shoulder blades, and a tail of fire poking out underneath his robes. He headed towards the highest building he could find.

The highest building in the city was not the mage's tower, not anymore. It was Raznig-Zhul. Kairngorth, Vanquisher of the Dead, immediately raced upstairs to entertain the God, fearing he was about to lay death and destruction to all around him. Sharenath had a bit of reputation for laying death and destruction to his immediate environments, and Kairngorth, Vanquisher of the Dead, was not too pleased by the prospects of it happening on his roof. He found the god standing, somewhat puzzled on top of the whole establishment. Below, the mages who had summoned him were crowding around the tavern. These mages had vowed never to enter a place such as a tavern, and so they watched on, helpless, as Kairngorth, Vanquisher of the Dead, invited Sharenath inside so that they could share some ale and tell tales of Brutal Victories.

To the dismay of the mages, their great Sharenath agreed. And several hours later, their God stumbled out the front door, quite severely intoxicated (the brew was so good that even a God could get plonkered off of it).
""They don't brew them like that up amongst the stars!"" Shouted the God to Kairngorth, Vanquisher of the Dead, before he barrelled through all the mages, setting one of them on fire with his tail. They stood in stunned silence as Sharenath took off towards the sky. They had sacrificed three virgins and an elephant for this ritual, and it had all gone to waste. Kairngorth invited them inside, offering a free drink for their troubles, and many of the Blood Sorcerers renounced their vows and agreed.

Being able to boast that a God had visited his tavern boosted it in popularity massively. Now it was also the most frequented Tavern in EVERY land, from EVERY realm. Occasionally Sharenath would visit when he wasn't busy fighting his eternal wars, and bring with him other Gods, which only boosted the popularity further.

From his humble beginnings as the Vanquisher of the Dead to owner of the most popular Tavern ever made anywhere in all planes of existence, Kairngorth, modest tavern owner, was quietly proud of what he had achieved. He wasn't sure where he would go next, if anywhere, but for the next thousand years our great hero was content to stay in his tavern.

When people say slutty, or drunk girls are ""asking for it"", they don't mean she was actively trying to get raped. They are pointing out the fact that, if you go into a bad neighborhood, and park a really expensive car at night, it is more than likely going to be stolen. It's not because parking a car is wrong, or that the people there are inherently bad, it's just a basic face of life that thieves exist, and there are ways to avoid it. It doesn't remove the blame from the thieves, or in the other case, rapists. But there are ways to help prevent things like this happening. Someone might call you an idiot leaving your car unlocked, or in a bad neighborhood, but they never say it is exactly your fault someone else did something bad to you. But it is a pretty simple thing to prevent with some common sense, and proactive action on your part.

This translates to: not getting wasted beyond control, knowing your limits is a big part of this. Drinking around those who you know will have your back, especially your first few times. Getting drunk in a more private setting, or if you must go out to bars, take it a little bit lighter than you normally would. 

A lot of women see this as being forced into not being able to have fun, and blame some kind of rape culture. I don't get drunk and pass out in the streets with money hanging out of my ears, and expect no one to touch it. We live in reality, and shitty things happen to a lot of different people, there is no reason to think you will ever be that special. 

As of right now, this ""rape culture"" fad is getting really big. The reason so many MRA groups are coming up, is because guys are being called creepy, or rapey, or what have you, just because they are talking to girls. Sure there are some who are really out there, but for the most part, it is over-used. My brother is having a daughter in about 3 months, and needless to say I am honestly kinda worried about if I was ever alone with her, given how people look at just an adult male simply being alone with a child in a public setting. People should be aware of child-abusers, but it honestly seems like it's a guilty until proven innocent system, same with rape culture.

I think most guys have been in a situation where they could have easily taken advantage of a girl who was well past her limits, and don't. I know I have, and even when I don't do anything but take care of her like I would any other friend, I get zero credit. I can't go through my college campus without having this rape culture thing thrown in my face, and if I say anything against it, I am victim blaming. No one even contests that a guy who violently rapes a woman deserves everything he gets; but a girl who gets passed out drunk and acts surprised when it happens irks a lot of people. I wish the world wasn't violent and cruel, but I would never bet my life, or any part of me in having every person at a party do the right thing. In a time where women are demanding more and more to be treated like equals, it rubs a lot of people the wrong way that women are still being coddled in issues like this. If I left my car unlocked and had something stolen, I would be called an idiot, and would probably be blamed for it. Someone else wronged me, but it doesn't change the fact that I ignored reality, and it came back to get me.

Whitewashing of communism and Stalin, along the line of: ""Sure, Stalin and Lenin were  cruel people, but first of all they weren't really Russian, and besides, only through cruelty we could stand up to the evil genocidal Europeans and industrialize in record time.""

A common argument I often hear as a Pole is ""Poland-Lithuania argued for control over Eastern Europe, Russia won and therefore could do anything to Poland"". You can't argue with Russians since they are naturally superior.

Russians seem to combine the persecution complex with superiority complex - they seem to think that their country is the worst, but decry others whether they agree or disagree.

I couldn't understand it! They thank God for everything, even though if he did exist he sure does treat them like shit. 

That is the thought that changed my life. 

Why would a God that is suppose to be kind and fair and all loving, treat his most devout worshipers like shit and allow us Westerners to live like kings while we burn the planet? How could he allow anything that happens to happen?

The only logical conclusion was that ""He"" doesn't exist, and if he does I would choose hell 1000 times before playing his little game. It's all nonsense.

 We are the ones who bid each other harm. We are simply hairless apes that still throw their shit at each other.

The things that may have happened to you have been most cruel, but they were also meaningless. They are insignificant. If you are looking for a meaning in life and can't find one, it's because there is no meaning. If you compare your life to the history of the universe it's not even visible. The human race alone is just a tiny blip compared to how old the earth is. 

Our Sun will become a Red Dwarf and consume us in about 5 billion years. The universe doesn't give a fuck if you're ready or not, it's going to move on without you. We will not be remembered by anyone. No one will miss us. 

You may be thinking ""How in the fuck is that supposed to make me feel better?"" Well if you take the scale of time and space as we know it, and compare that to earths puny length of existence. It shows us something quite spectacular, and that is that we are here completely by chance. That is fucking amazing. Not only are we living multicellular organisms, but we are self aware, and we have the ability to define concepts such as emotion. 

If we are all here by chance, then that means there is no God. If there is no God than there is no good or evil. If there is no good or evil, than that means that we are the ones deciding whats right and wrong, or whats good or evil. There is no selfish Sky God smashing the ocean into cities and flooding famished countries with plagues or making fathers rape there daughters. We live on an unstable collection of space dust and we hurt each other. No god chose a king to rule the land, the king was just the smartest ape to take it for himself.

"cfgkgug","I've seen her before. The girl in that picture. I've seen her before this prompt was posted. Her name was . . . Coralee. I think. I think her name was Coralee. Why did you post that picture? She's been dead for years; nearly sixty in fact.

Where did you find it? I mean, it's probably some stock photo you found on the internet, but I'm curious. Me and my family used to visit a farm down south of the Missouri/Arkansas line. There were three of us plus our parents. I know that picture. I used to lie in bed staring up at it, trying to fall asleep. The picture was creepy, but no where near as creepy as the story my grandfather used to tell with regards to how she died.

Can you imagine that? Twelve year old me, laying in an old bed that smelled of old people and moth balls. Thick handmade blankets my grandmother stitched in her sewing circle were draped across me and layered several blankets thick as if to protect me from the next ice age. A space heater hissed near the door, popping and sparking as errant particles of dust and foolish insects made contact with the electric filaments heating the room. And, her face was always staring.

Grandfather used to come in and sit beside me. On one level, I think he was just trying to put my mind at ease, but on a different level, I think he'd siphoned gasoline from one to many gas tanks. He had a heightened way about him. One moment he was a broken down farmer scratching itches in disgusting places in full view of anyone foolish enough not to look away, in other moments he was feverish telling me tales of Coralee and of the men who stole her.

Arkansas, in the area where he lived, was a lot like the Hatfield and McCoys with their weeping hats, ill-fitting stained and patched clothing, and ramshackle cabins built of blued logs and split-shingle roofs. It was repressed, and at the time his story took place, the county had only a single sheriff to police it and two part-time deputies. 

It was a land dispute. Coralee's father, my grandfather's brother, had been the recipient of a gift of land from his wife's late father. In his will, he'd bequeathed ninety acres of land, a dilapidated cabin, and a simple barn to him. Clyde Davies, my grandfather's brother, had a single solitary child. Her name was Coralee. Shaw Eggert was a cruel man. He had bought land off Clyde's father-in-law, a man named Hustus Levings, several times. At the time of Hustus's death, Shaw had been courting Hustus with offers for the ninety acres. Hustus had been adamant in his refusal.

After the old man's death and Clyde's *inheritance*, Shaw contested the the will claiming the land was his and even scrounged up a bill of sale for the property. It was a different time according to grandpa. People still rode everywhere in the back of pickups, and there were horse and buggies being driven by people who weren't Amish. Shaw's claim was being given credence. The judge who presided in that county was on a circuit. He only heard cases when he was in town and it was two and sometimes three weeks before his circuit brought him to the county seat where the land resided.

As I said, gramps said Shaw was a mean cuss. He didn't want to wait. He resorted to the way things were typically handled around those parts. He stole something Clyde would miss and ransomed it for the deed to the property. It was Coralee, the girl in the picture you posted for this prompt. Usually, the ransoming entailed taking cattle or horses or farm equipment. Shaw knew what Clyde valued, and he took her. Him and two of his cousins came a calling around midnight in the spring of that year.

According to grandpa, the rains were falling heavy during that season. Tornados were ripping up the forest across the state, lighting was falling from the sky in curtains of fire, and the rivers were up. Shaw worked Clyde over with the handle of a pickaxe, or a hillbilly broadsword as grandfather called it. Shaw's cousins took Coralee away, screaming and crying for her daddy. Grandfather told it, telling that even after taking the whoopin' Shaw threw him, the man still tried to crawl after the kidnappers. Shaw broke his jaw for this show of defiance. He gave Shaw a choice, bring the deed by midnight the next day or say goodbye to Coralee.

You know, it wasn't the grainy aspect of that photo that creeped me out about the picture. It was grandpa's retelling. Clyde had the sheriff and the sheriff's deputies over at Shaw's by midmorning the next day. They searched the farm, and the sheriff even threatened to take Shaw in, but his cousins vouched for him, claiming he'd been home all night the night before. The sheriff had no choice but to believe them. It was a different time.

Grandfather still doesn't know why Clyde didn't just hand over the deed. He loved his daughter well enough, but in the heat of emotion, men do stupid things. Clyde went for his daughter instead, and he went with a twelve gauge. Gramps said the lighting was like a strobe light that night, flashing so often it looked more like day than night. Clyde shot one of Shaw's cousins in the stomach with the shotgun. The other? He shot in the thigh. He had only meant to wound him according to gramps. Evidently, being shot in the leg is a little more serious than television makes it seem. There's an artery there that if nicked or cut will cause a man to bleed to death in a matter of seconds. Clyde's shotgun cut that artery. Shaw's cousins were dead three minutes after Clyde arrived to demand his daughter back--his sweet Coralee.

He didn't shoot Shaw. Shaw agreed to give back his daughter. There's moments when men, cruel or kind, try to be clever and realize to late they're as stupid as a stump. Shaw had one of those moments. He'd dropped Coralee in a burlap sack, gagged her, and lowered her halfway down the well so the sheriff wouldn't find her. It was cruel, but clever under normal conditions. But, the creeks were up. It'd been raining off and on for almost three weeks. In a dry season, Coralee would have lived, but it wasn't the dry season, and the creeks *were* up. The entire water table had been steadily rising for twenty-one days.

Grandpa said afterwards--after he'd talked to his brother in prison--that Clyde almost felt sorry for Shaw when he saw that burlap sack three feet under the surface of the water. The well had filled up from all the run off and the rising water table. Clyde had almost understood the mistake, but it was his Coralee in the bag--cold, terrified, and blue. He didn't shoot Shaw though. When the sheriff came back the next day with more men, they found Shaw nailed to the barn door still alive with Clyde slowly cutting parts off of him. It was the sheriff who shot Shaw, but not for the crime he committed. He did it to put the cruel bastard out of his misery.

Clyde died in prison. Grandpa, when he was in his heigtened moments, told me that Shaws property had gone back to the county after his death, and he'd bought it. He said he'd burned Shaw's cabin to the ground along with the barn and all his outbuildings. he'd even filled in the well where Coralee had died.

I don't know if any of this is true. I figured it was just gramps trying to get my goat. He told me that it was his fault the picture scared me seeing as how he'd built his cabin over the old well. He used to tell me that if Coralee's picture looked like it was starring at me, then she probably was. He said she'd probably managed finally to crawl up out the well. It's probably not true, but look at that picture. Tell me that after hearing this, you could sleep in a room at twelve years old with that picture hanging over your bed and with the fear that there really was a well beneath your bed.

"cffommf","I recall a distinction having been drawn in a line of cases dealing with maximum sentences under sentencing guidelines. 

The cruelty prong considers humane treatment during the sentence. 

The unusual prong considers social comparisons. 

For example, to address the cruelty prong, the court would consider whether the punishment shocks the conscious or involves deprivation of necessities. To address the unusual prong, the court would consider the punishment for the same crime historically in that forum, as well as presently in other fora.

That said, I remember each prong being treated together. Perhaps a sentence could be slightly cruel, but very unusual. Where the sentence struck down, it would be said to be cruel and unusual.

I doubt there are any cases that challenge the sentence on one prong alone. If they were truly independent, any novel sentence would be grounds for appeal.

Inequality is only bad if you have nothing. Or if you're forced to work a dehumanizing, dangerous or disgusting job - and still come out on the bottom. If you can't afford to have children, or feed your family if you already did. If when you get sick and can't work you lose everything, and still get dumped with medical bills you couldn't have paid even if you'd been working the entire time you were in hospital.


And unfortunately that's exactly the inequality we have.  Or do you really think that the guy who cleans out the sewers works less hard than the guy who handles payroll for the same company?

I will tell the story, and if you have questions I will be happy to answer them.

My son had an undiagnosed chemical imbalance for most of his life, just like I did. I didn't know I was ill until I was 35. He had been diagnosed with ADHD but never really fit all the criteria for the diagnosis. When he was 19, after I found out what I had, I took him to the Dr I saw and he was treated for Bi-polar. He was given medication. It seemed to work, this was in April(?) of 2006.  He died that November on the 9th.

Bi-polars are notoriously hard to medicate. They feel better, then quit. 

He had a girlfriend at the time, it was a pretty stormy relationship. They had been together a few years,she got pregnant when he was 18.They had a son, he is wonderful and so like my son. He was a wonderful dad. The sun rose and set with that child. Often her grandmother would call and ask me how Jason knew so much about being a parent. He has 3 younger siblings and was a really good big brother. He watched me and learned. I am so proud of what kind of parent he was.

They moved in together not too long before he died. The 3 of them lived in an upstairs apartment. He had a job and was doing well. There had been some drug use/abuse that he got out of previous to this. He was self medicating for a while but had stopped. I think he still drank a bit.   ( please don't be offended if I jump around, this is a little tough, just ask if I confuse you)

 One day he came home and said they had a fight. He said she told him that she wished he would just kill himself already so he would leave her alone forever. He was so hurt by that. He carried that for a few months before it was over. 

I was worried about him. He and his step-dad had a falling out so he could not live at home anymore. I am not too sure of the order of this, so please bear with me. I had told my ( ex) husband that I was afraid Jason was going to kill himself. I was really worried. He said something cruel, but accurate. He asked what he wanted him to do, increase the life insurance? He was correct in what he was saying, there was nothing in his opinion that he could do about it. 

Sunday morning I was not home, I had gone to a meeting. I didn't check my calls until around 2. Saturday night he had gone home and Jessica was there with another guy. My son was not a fighter, but he did have a big mouth. There was an argument with  the guy, and Adam hit him, blacked his eyes, may have broken his nose. During all this, she had told him that he had to get out, never come back and she would never see his son again. He drank a bottle and went across the street to the park and slept on a bench. His was bloodied and most likely had alcohol poisoning.  Someone saw him that morning and called an ambulance. The hospital lab finally called around 10 am. I got there around 2 pm. He was drunk and belligerent. I didn't even know where he lived, because he had kept it from me. He wanted to go to his apt. I took him and he banged on doors. I knew he would go to jail. At this point, I saw his father in him and I had to go. 

He got arrested and I couldn't bail him out. I went to see him and he begged and begged. ( I think this was when I told my ex that I thought he was going to kill himself.)After he went back to the cell I sat and cried. He did get out on Monday. He tried to come home but my ex wouldn't let him( I think this was when I told my ex that I thought he was going to kill himself.). So he carried his belongings to my house. My ex wouldn't let me drive him to get his stuff. He made 2 trips with laundry baskets, and carried them 4 miles.  I was allowed to feed him like once a day. So he would come home and eat. He stayed with friends. 

On Tuesday, he drank bleach. He just threw it up. No one called me or let me know what was going on.  

On Wendnesday he saw his younger brother. Apparently they said their goodbyes. His brother was 14. He wanted to go with him, but his friends said they would take care of him, not to worry.  Wednesday night his friends left to smoke crack. He came over to the house to eat, and we talked. He had lost his wallet, and needed an ID to get food from the soup kitchen in town. He did  have a job, but he hadn't taken his medicine since probably Saturday.  He went outside. All of a sudden I had this overwhelming urge to tell him I love him. I went out to catch him, and I told him he needed to get his ID, take his meds, a few other things. He walked away and said ,""I know mom"".  I was so terribly worried. I didn't tell him I loved him, though. I didn't say the words. 

He told his roomate he was going to go to Jessica's apt and hang himself from her porch. Again, no one told me. No one called anyone. 

Around 2 am he came home and his 10 yr old sister saw him on the porch. She let him in and aksed if he was hungry so she made him some cereal and they talked. He said something that made her think he was going away.She asked if he was going to California to live with his dad. He said he was and asked her for money.She said she didn't have any but she would go ask me. He said, Don't wake mom. He said for her to tell me, his step dad, his brother and his other sister that he loved them ( His other sister was 13) and he left. On his way out he picked up the cord to the drop light.
He got to her apt around 3 am and tied the cord off at the top of the porch. It was a second floor apt with an outside entrance to the backyard, with a fence on the side so you couldn't easily see the back yard from the street. Jessica was going to take the trash out at 3.She would have taken it out to the back porch. But she changed her mind. This story might have ended differently had she done that. 

 Instead, he died and was there alone in the backyard hanging from the porch, with his feet just touching the ground by the time they found him at 10 am. The landlady saw him standing in the backyard. Jessica and the new boyfriend, as well as someone else went to confront him. She was behind him and yelled at him, but he wouldn't turn around. She didn't know until she touched him.  Oddly, around this time, my best friend, who was the kids 'Aunt' happened to drive by. On her way back, she saw the ambulance and police, she knew someone had died. 

They had to go to the police station and answer questions. I was out of town and didn't find out until around 5. We pulled up and the kids ran up and said the coroner was there. I had hoped he killed somone . That sounds terrible, but I did. I had been sick all morning with worry that he was going to kill himself. I have the ability to know things sometimes, I didn't know when my child died. 

They came in and told us. I sat on the floor and cried. They told the kids. 

We had the funeral after a week, they shaved his goatee but not his mustache. I don't know why that was important , but it was. I learned a lot about autopsies and funerals. 

Jessica came over before the funeral and I asked him if she said that too him, about him killing himself. She cried and said she was so sorry. I didn't blame her.  Everyone else did, I didn't have the heart. 

There was shock for a long time. At the visitation I went in alone after it was over. I cried alone with my son. I didn't know people were still there in the outer entrance. Eventually my husband came in. I was embarrassed that his friends were still there, and heard me as well as my family and best friend. But the kids, they didn't know where to go or what to do.They had their own guilt. 

I was not to go to the inquest. It was a couple months later. I foolishly said yes when they asked if I wanted to know what was going to be said. My son had been mistaken a few times for another young man in town. He didn't have an ID when he died. So after our conversation I had a separation from reality. I believed he was not dead, and that we had cremated another woman's son and that she had to be found.I was calm about it, in my view. My ex was woken up that evening, ( he worked night shift) and tried to reason with me. We called my counselor because  I believed she had talked to him. Long story short, we went to the pharmacy, got a new med and by that night I cried because I knew the truth.

A month or so later, on my wedding anniversary, ( this was the end of February) I had to go stay in the hospital for a week because I couldn't live with the pain anymore. I was better after a week. 

I am not the same person. My children are changed. My youngest daughter who saw him last has now been hospitalized 12 times and the last time was last fall. Recently her suicidal ideation matches her brothers. She kept wanting to hang herself with an extention cord in our garage. I am recently divorced and now have to handle this on my own. 



 I am far less strict since he died, which is bad. It does nothing to better my kids, which are all grown but the last one who is almost 18. I am easily manipulated by them,(my youngest actually ) because I am always afraid she will kill herself. Which she uses. She has been ill a long time now.

"cf7oy9a","*I rarely write much, but I got going with this one. (Thanks for the prompt!) I was going for a sort of cyberpunk vibe here, but I haven't done the worldbuilding to reveal too much about the setting.*

The cold monotone of the heart rate monitor beeps at the base of my skull. The screen to my left shudders as its refresh rate struggles to keep up with the data readout's updates. It's an old model; the tech is several generations out of date, but the State's budget can hardly afford to keep inmates fed, let alone monitored. The low-res display, marred by several burned-out pixels and a coating of dust, is the only reading that I've had for the past half-decade. 

I know my average blood pressure, my height, my weight, and my heart's beats per minute up to seventeen decimal places. I can recite sections of my genetic code and I can tell you what each pairing means: there, my hair color, and over there, my skin tone. There, my above-average capacity for rational thought.

There, my schizophrenia.

I have read aloud the mechanical rhythm of the code until my voice became hoarse and my pulse quickened dangerously, punctuating my tired voice with incessant beeps. The screen is my prosthetic sense. Perhaps it's the only one that I have left, besides my sight - my smell and touch have long since become irrelevant; retrograde. I need not know how the cell smells, or feels, or how my imprisonment changes my neural pathways.

I can read that.

That beeping noise can lull me to sleep. The screen tells me precisely how my sleep patterns change. I've played with the system and I could sleep for a week if I wanted to, my heart slowed to the point that it sets off an alarm. Not that it would do me any good - the cell will just resuscitate me, which involves several excruciating shocks delivered through the gurney that I'm strapped to. The one time I tried that, I found that the pain of my entire circulatory and nervous systems stopping and restarting was incredible, though after a few years here, I believed then that any change at all in the grim routine was worth it. In this place, you forget to even try to feel anything after a while. Since that particular stunt, I've been fed a steady drip of sedatives - they keep most of my mind quiet, dulling my emotions along with my symptoms. 

At 0436 hours, the drip is empty. Three minutes later, a red light flashes on the screen.

The beeping stops. My vision clears. The cell walls are no longer opaque; the chemicals within have dissipated, rendering the metallic surfaces transparent. *The screen turns off.*

The restraints around my hands and ankles slide shut. I fall to the floor...

I am blind. I see, but I cannot read - I cannot know. I seem to cycle through phases of consciousness as the drugs wear off, but I cannot read what is happening to me. My eyelids close, and I find it nearly impossible to hold them open. I shiver, harder and longer than I would have thought possible. My hands feel as though pierced with jagged shards of glass, clumsily smashing and sending jolts of pain through my forearms. I can *feel* the floor again.

I quiver, manage to crawl towards the wall, and stare through layers of grime into a neighboring cell. The walls are faint enough that I can make out two more behind it. The gurneys stand unattended; wires litter the floor like entrails. I panic.

The panic is a symptom of mine. I've studied it as long as I can remember, even before I was imprisoned. Yet not until I met the screen could I understand it. 

I breathe three times. 

My heart slows. 

My thoughts clear as the sedatives finally wear off. I manage to stand and empty the half-full bag of nutritional fluids into my mouth. Thankfully, the drugs were administered separately. Half a bag should allow me to survive for three days, if I regulate my systems conservatively. I no longer have access to the screen's data, but my regained senses are more than enough to control my body's basic workings. On the other hand, the years strapped to the gurney have kept me physically weak. Even if the door weren't reinforced, I would have no hope of gaining freedom through brute force.

The State had a protocol for dealing with genetic defects. My condition developed during my studies in the biotech industry and eventually my symptoms became impossible to hide, despite my best efforts to deter them with self-medication. The institutions were cruel, but bearable. No gurneys, no constant sedatives. I was hardly lucid at the time, but some order from above forced all patients to change districts. The Precinct delivered us to the cells as if we were someone's private collection. The walls weren't caked with dirt and decay then. Maybe the shutdown is just a change in protocol, and I'll be back on the gurney in some other cell, in some other district. I immediately feel the familiar rising paranoia again, but quickly ""quarantine"" - as I consider the process - the change in my cranial chemistry.

I am trapped, but I also have regained some of my freedom. I can think without the monitors beeping and reading every molecular change, perhaps guessing at my thoughts.

I consider another possibility: I could effectively hibernate and wait out whatever sort of shutdown the district is experiencing. As long as the prison remains the same moderate temperature, I could survive for a couple of weeks with a slowed heart-rate. I know I can't give up my freedom like that, though. Either I'll wake up in the gurney, with my dismal future restored as a vegetative, genetic cripple that can't be killed or cured for fear of psuedo-ethical protocols' restrictions, or I'll wake up too weak to have any hope of escape. Perhaps I'll sleep through my death from malnutrition and dehydration. I'm not willing to take that risk.

The lights go out. A section of the cell wall jolts aside just enough to let in a crack of outside light. It's blinding.

"cef027s","The plagues were directed at the religious system of Egypt, as if it were a showdown between YHWH and their panoply of deities. For instance, the 9th plague was a plague of darkness. The Egyptians worshiped the sun god (Ra or Re), and so the plague of darkness showed their god to be powerless against YHWH.

As far as the 10th plague, the pharaoh was considered to be a god on earth, and when he died, it was believed that he became Osiris, the god of the the afterlife, the underworld, and the dead. As such, however, Osiris was also considered the ""King of the Living."" He granted all life.

After having rebuffed YHWH nine times, and having been on the losing end 9 times, he is still stubborn against the request of Moses to free the people. The ultimate challenge, which was a challenge to Pharaoh's person, his kingship, and his divinity, was a showdown about life and death, over which the Pharaohs were believed to have ultimate control. The way to break the king, since the contest between every other divine notion of Egypt didn't bring about the freedom of his people, was on the pivotal and supreme issue of life and death.

Now, you may say it was Pharaoh who sinned, and not the Egyptian people, and certainly not the tiny babies. Weren't they just little innocents? But what does say to us about social sin? The Egyptians passively stood by and watched the enslavement and mistreatment of the Israelites. Did they not therefore share in the responsibility for Israel’s oppression? We think about the German people, and even the church, standing by as Adolph Hitler and his military did the work of the Holocaust. The question is, isn’t passivity or failure to stand up for justice a part of the sin that is actively committed?

The country has been involved in blasphemous religious practice, and they have defied God, rebelled against Him and disobeyed them, and they have done so intentionally and admitted to it Ex. 9.27). God has every right to nuke the whole country, but nonetheless He is judging them for sin. He has warned them ahead of time and given them many chances to repent and submit, which they don’t do. By targeting the children he is making a statement primarily about their blasphemous religious system, and it is a judgment on their idolatry. Nonetheless, we also have to understand that when children die, they go to heaven, so this is not a problem for the children. It is a problem for the families of the country who are complicit in their idolatry and disobedience. The other issue, though, is that Pharaoh and the people have been warned and given time to respond, and even have the mechanism of mercy as an option: anyone who slays the lamb and puts the blood on the doorposts will be spared. God is not merciless.

"cebpfin","What?!  What kind of opinion is that?  It's bad because it's bad?  That's not an argument!  There's no reasoning behind it!  I can only assume you have this opinion because you haven't a clue as to how to truly watch a show!  There will be minor spoilers regarding the themes of the show below!

School Days!  It is a show that transcends the ordinary boundaries of the medium!  Most shows limit themselves to invoking emotions by having you relate to the characters!  People do things in fantastical situations that are cruel, but ultimately unrelatable!  Of course the man who blows up an entire planet is evil!  But we cannot hate him on a *personal* level!  That is where School Days succeeds!  It brings us a main character whose every minor action invokes rage!  Each action he takes is personally offensive!  He isn't the respectable villain!  He's also not the over-the-top fantasy villain who commits major crimes!  No, one must hate him for the way he lives his life, the very way he thinks!  He offends in a way that's so personally deplorable that the viewer is led to personally loathing him, more than any other character!

Not only are his actions deplorable, but he doesn't even stick to them!  He runs away from the problems he brought upon himself!  He's a coward!  He's weak, and ineffectual, and yet also just kind enough to bring in girls, because he white knights!  He's awkward!  He doesn't even have game!  The plot comes about without any significant planning on his part, because he can't plan five minutes ahead, or stick to any course!  He waffles!  He holds strong enough emotions to lecture, to declare his love, but forgets about it five minutes later!  He has no personal sense of identity, no code for his actions!  In any other setting, he wouldn't even rate an iota, because he's insignificant!  But circumstances were fortunate for him, so we could see how every vile portion of his character could surface.

But no.  That's not even the deepest part of what makes Makoto an important character.  Makoto, so frequently, is a mirror of our inner thoughts.  The actions we consider taking, without a filter on them, run entirely by whimsy.  The appealing thought of being kind to each girl, that urge to kiss the girl in front of you despite having a girlfriend, because she looks so sweet and you know you could get away with it.  Every small little lack of judgment, every weakness in character that we can see in ourselves, and have to actively resist.  Those little thoughts about every girl you spend time with, even though you know that they're just idle imaginings.  The devil on your shoulder, with no conscience to temper it, results in Makoto.  Any person could end up like Makoto, because so many people have the same urges he did, especially in the tempestuous era of high school.  Weakness, jealousy, fear, lust.  Every small character flaw, compounded.  Makoto is a cautionary tale, an urge to turn away from each of those thoughts.  School Days defines them clearly, makes them easy to recognize.  It makes all those small things that you can weakly attempt to justify *that much more difficult* to deceive yourself about.  Things that seem innocent enough, minor sins that won't go anywhere, that no one will ever find out about.  This show demonstrates where that path can lead.

So when you hate Makoto, and you think to yourself ""what a terrible show!"", you're **WRONG**.  You are *meant* to hate Makoto.  That's the entire POINT.  Everything about this show resolves around enraging its viewers and making them uncomfortable.  The creators have gone past trying to make you have feelings by affecting the viewers, and instead are attempting to offend you, personally.  Being offended when that was their goal doesn't make the show *bad*, it means they have succeeded, gloriously.  You've been played!  You've been had!  You were played like a fiddle, and it flew right over your head!  Can you think of anything that angers you like School Days?  This is just Makoto I've been talking about!  The other characters are cautionary tales too, and the story structure itself is meant to enrage you.  You know what happens in the School Days VN?  It *deliberately* misinterprets your choices!  You try to be faithful to a girl, but Makoto fucks it up!  I'm pretty sure it's impossible to not cheat in that VN!  I was so angry about this for a while, until I remembered how everything about School Days is meant to anger me.  And then it made sense again.  School Days is meant to offend on every level possible, and succeeds gloriously.  The division in the fanbase is evident of this.  So many people outright *hate* it.  That's part of the entertainment for the other half.  We see what School Days has wrought amongst those who don't understand it.  It's kinda fabulous and hilarious, but then people insult it.  I can see disliking it, but you can never deny that it's an **important** show.  Calling it trash and dumb just demonstrates that you have no idea what you're talking about.  It was masterfully crafted on so many meta levels that it would boggle the creators of Inception.

"ce7td59","I actually think Dany's story is going to mirror her father's in many way (perhaps even ending with Barristan having to kill her for the good of the realm when she tries to burn all of KL to the ground with dragonfire). Look at what has been dead about the mad king, he was actually a thoughtful guy and some though a good ruler until Dunsendale, at which point he bacame increasingly paranoid cruel. I think Dany started out good and was growing into a good queen but the events of Mereen will lead to her seeing plots behind every corner (which she is already predisposed to do after 2 failed assassination attempts and what happened to Drogo). She has already demonstrated a capacity for cruelty when provoked by her choice to crucify the Mereeneese nobles as retribution (which many would say was a gross overreaction sure to alienate the people she was trying to rule). Is it really that much of a leap to picture her catching a ""traitor"" and having him burned in wildfire? 

I think she is going to prove to be a very interesting character arc. She was set up at the beginning of the series as this young, kind hearted little girl that suffered abuse by her brother and was sold into an unwanted marriage. As she develops over the ffirst 2 books she shows herself to be caring and kind to her people (but has some flashes of cruelty that were justified in the eyes of the reader, with her brothers crown and Mirri's funeral pyre). In Meereen she is growing more paranoid and cruel, but since we see the story only from her POV she is still sympathetic for the rreader and all of her actions have apparent justification. I would not be surprised, as we start to get POV chapters viewing her from the outside, if we see her grow into a completely cruel and insane leader. This would actually be great for the story as it would serve to demonstrate the power of POV (one of the key themes of the series) and how honorable people can come to serve tyrants with staunch loyalty. 

Just my opinion, but that's how I've read her so far.",1387734730,"in meereen she is growing more paranoid and cruel, but since we see the story only from her pov she is still sympathetic for the rreader and all of her actions have apparent justification.","paranoid and cruel","cruel",NA,FALSE,"more paranoid and cruel","paranoid",NA,"more",0
"ce2wadh","&gt; I exclusively dated white guys .. -- ... I was always just some exotic fun.

Maybe because you did the former as a policy and the latter was an outcome of your attitude. I don't think Western men look at Indian women at an exotic plaything anymore but if you are ""exclusive"" about your dating in such a way then I doubt it's going to be a natural relationship.

&gt; I didn't actually do it to spite Indian men or anything like that. I did what a lot of my white female friends did; I thought I was the same as them

It's hard to believe and connect whatever you have said above. But yeah, people are this naive sometimes.

&gt; Most white guys I ran into wanted white wives.

You are again approaching it incorrectly IMHO. Why don't you just say and accept that ""most guy I ran into just wanted a wife they were attracted to, respected and loved"". Maybe your preference and ""exclusivity"" (for whatever reason) put them off.

&gt; At my age getting an arranged marriage or finding another Indian man to marry me is out of the question.

I agree you do not fit the bill of a traditional Indian bride but no.. it's not out of question! Then again you were never and are not a traditional bride anyway. Though why an Indian man? First white then brown, is it a cycle? Please don't get me wrong. I know I am sounding rude but there's no use of introspection and still get everything wrong all over again. You are hurt, you were stupid and naive; doesn't mean the past should affect your point of view this drastically. Pick one thing at a time.

&gt; Majority of Indian guys usually get married pretty early. **Often either to another Indian girl they meet here, or they go back to India for an arranged marriage**. My parents have tried signing me up for a matrimony site, but of the guys I’d meet they would be turned off by my history (drink/eat meat/not a virgin)

Lots of fallacies here, except maybe for the part highlighted. They don't have any choice either. Maybe because of people like you exclusively want to date white guys :-). Jokes apart, even my friends are getting married and I am 27+. But they have no plans for higher studies, no plans to see the world or try their hands their entrepreneurship so they are settling down and that's a natural course of action IMO. What else are they gonna do? 

&gt;  ""this is what happens when you become whitewashed (embracing Western Culture) alone and unhappy.""

That's cruel but true.

&gt; No guys really see me as anyone they want a future with.

You should rather think why!

&gt; The few progressive Indian guys I met that I really felt like I had a future with ended up leaving me for a **younger virgin** bride from India.

Duh!!! You are just cribbing and full of misinformation. You indirectly want to blame others for your own mistakes or missed opportunities.

&gt; One of my exboyfriends (Indian) told me ""You are great and all, but I can get a much better looking girl if I go to India, and one that will also cook for me."" 

So?

&gt; I just wanted to make things clear **I didn't ""sleep around.""** Most of my relationships have been long term I have **only** been **with 18 guys** and I have been sexually active **since** I was **17 years old**. 

This makes me feel you might be trolling here :D. Not judging but your switch frequency is quite good but then again that's the West.

&gt; If any of you guys. have any advice for me please share with me

"cdqdxkr","African people  

I gave it some thought and yes. You're right. The options, which will yield good results are either give education, or wait for some warlord who wants to promote education to the people. And i agree that educating a number of people from Africa would be more reliable than letting history takes its course. (Even though we might see some interesting cultural developments, but hell, for the children).

Activism and Victim mentality  
Activism is about power. But the general attitude in the simple people populace is that ""we can't do much, gotta live until someone changes it"". Otherwise there would be way more blood spilled in Africa.  
Though you still miss my point of ""Let them figure out shit for themselves"". It will lead to change that is more bloody and cruel. But that change will be their own.  
You have to understand, also, the difference between the Victim mentality in Germany post WW1. (Which is why blaming the Jews worked so well). Which was balanced by conquest in the past. When Russians lost WW1 they could say ""we're a nation that conquered a great deal of Eurasia). Versus a continent which achieved nothing in it's history, which is the longest in the world. And a continent whose problems are solved by outside sources most of the time (For instance Bill Gates tries to irradiate a disease). Not to sound like a jerk, but it's human nature to exploit the weak. It's not bad (because bad is ""causes harm to my group/me), it seems amoral, but morals are a fragment of our imagination. The cause for which is our cherishing of empathy.

Languages and differences in africa.  
We had a lot more different languages in Europe. But the powerful warlords were able to conquer and unify nations, thus creating large nations that consist of smaller etnosi. Look at Russia. There are many languages spoken throughout the country (its called a federation for a reason). But everyone knows Russian, which allows access to the accumulated knowledge of the whole, large country. Even though they were able to previously speak only their own language (For instance - Udmurts/Yakuts and etc).  
You have to understand that no other continent is so far behind. It's something about Africa (and maybe some places SA), that makes them lag. And that problem is as you said - no real need for agriculture.  
By the way, do you know how Russia ""fixed"" the Chechnya problem? (Same as Africa, but in russian territory). They gave a good pile of cash to the biggest, hairiest clan leader. And he simply killed all the other clans. Sure, this plan may backfire one day. But atleast Chechnya isn't such a big pain in the arse to deal with. 


Even the basic societies understand opression.  
Even a dog understands opression. E.G. It will have more positive emotions with a non-opressive owner, than with a tyrant. (can be checked via skin resistance)  

Agriculture  
Nomadic cultures also had their culture. They also unified nations, and when a nomadic culture grew to big - it tended to partially settle somewhere. This didn't happen in Africa.


Slavery  
Remember, Europeans didn't come to africa, round people up and bring them to America. Africans sold their own kind to Europeans. Think about it. When Europeans were colonizing a different continent, Africans were still in tribes. Ofcourse they were exploited. Simply because that's what we do. We exploit the poor chinese at Foxconn, we exploit the indians in call centers. The strong exploit the weak, and always will, and always were. It's not something to be ashamed of. But if you want to - i'd suggest throwing away the majority of your electronics.
 

Russians in Africa.  
I think you can try googling. You wilkl find some information. Because my sources are confessions of veterans from niche papers. Though what is openly known, is that Russians did educate Africans. 

Fixing it.  
I agree. Educate Africans,. Empower the ones who are willing. Don't give them supplies of food. Give them books.

When I was 18 I had *zero* experience with men. Never even middle school danced with a guy, I mean nothing. I felt ugly and worthless. To top it off I had recently developed anorexia. I was a hot mess of low self-esteem prime for the picking. I wonder if Joe could like, smell it on me or something. In any case, I'm at my first frat party, standing around all awkward and shit, and the most *gorgeous* man imaginable walks up to me--me! Of all the girls there, *me* and hands me a cup: ""hey beautiful, what are you doing all alone"". I was his right then and there. But we continued talking all night and we connected on what I thought to be this deep level. That night he actually hurt me for the first time, and I let him. He put out his cigar on my arm, I still have the mark four years later. He had a girlfriend and was cheating on her with at least five other girls. I refused to have sex with him because we weren't officially dating, but he used me for blowjobs all the time. The first time I went down on him(inexperienced and he was huge) I threw up on him. He got upset and threw me out of his room and then the next day told me I needed practice and arranged for me to meet with his friend. For practice.

Joe was the kind of alpha that makes TRP look like a joke. He was everything they wish they could be in their wildest fantasies. He was manipulative and cruel, but charismatic. He rarely physically hit me but his rages were terrifying enough. The worst part though, was that he unlocked this part of me that is also a horrible, callous, manipulative asshole. He told me life was a game and he was always there to egg me on, to praise me for my sick, twisted behavior. Then I find another guy who wants to date me. This other guy and I are all set to be official boyfriend and girlfriend. Which to Joe meant that someone was finally going to get what he had been after for a while: my virginity. Well, Joe couldn't have that could he? So he raped me. Twice. And then *stopped speaking to me*. I still loved him, I forgave him. But no, after he raped me *he* walked away. We started talking again later, and I didn't have the strength to completely cut him out of my life until I met my current boyfriend.

"cdhfemy","Since people have been executed throughout history, including the history of the US, it would be hard to consider the death penalty to be unusual, although you could certainly regard it as cruel.  Cruel but usual is legal; only cruel and unusual is unconstitutional.  You haven't even stated the strongest argument against the death penalty, which is that many people have been wrongly convicted, and subsequently exonerated (usually by DNA evidence, or by a recanted testimony).  Wrongly imprisoned people can be released from prison, but wrongly executed people cannot be brought back from the dead.
However, I also know of some very strong arguments for the death penalty.  Many people who go to jail will continue to commit crimes, sometimes very serious crimes.  They may murder other prisoners, or prison staff, or they may escape from prison.  I do know of some cases of people who were convicted of murder and went to jail, and then escaped from jail and murdered more people (and some people have done this repeatedly).  One could argue that the use of a super-max type prison reduces the risk of escape, but then, that level of security also increases the expense, and one of your concerns is the cost of the death penalty.  It is true that prolonged legal appeals make the death penalty very expensive, but the legal system can be tweaked.  Some people advocate that when a person has been sentenced to death, that sentence must be either overturned, or carried out, within a year of sentencing.  In other words, you don't have potentially decades to appeal your case, you can appeal within a period of one year, then your time is up.  This would definitely hold down the cost.  I believe that with this reform, the death penalty would cost less than decades of incarceration, which is hardly cheap.  And as far as the risk of executing the wrongly convicted, that is a legitimate concern (that I raised myself) but I also think that it would be better to simply conduct trials with greater care, to avoid convicting the innocent.  Many people are very clearly and obviously guilty of terrible and monstrous crimes, and those people should, in my humble opinion, be executed.  If there is any doubt, then don't execute them.  That is reasonable.  And yes, even if I personally were to be accused of a crime and subjected to the legal system that I am advocating, I would accept it.",1384810142,"cruel but usual is legal; only cruel and unusual is unconstitutional.","cruel but usual","cruel","but",FALSE,"cruel but usual","usual",NA,NA,1

"cddd8h0","Growing up one of my favorite things was feeding spiders and seeing them attack like in this gif while watching them grow over the summer.

A friend and I use to make rounds around the neighborhood where we knew there were [Barn Spiders](http://gal.xenogere.com/Nature/Arachnids/20091108037657/773990961_avBuP-M.jpg) and feed them ants or grasshoppers that were nearby. Something about watching how fast and accurately they worked was mesmerizing and very cool to an 8 year old.

So over the summer we watch them go from little yellow specs into huge spiders due to our constant supplying of their giant webs. One evening we decided we wanted to catch some of these spiders to keep as pets, so we set out with mason jars. Our tactic was to throw a bug into the web and have the spider come flying down to secure it like normal. Then once he was out from hiding we used a stick to grab his web and him and scrape him into a closed mason jar, I know now that this was cruel and unnecessary but unfortunately I can't go back and scold my younger self.

Anyway we did this about two or three times collecting some of the biggest spider we knew of and carried the jars around pretty proud of ourselves. By the time we got to the 4th spider it was beginning to get dark out and was starting to become hard to see what we were doing. Somewhere along the way we stopped and wanted to see how our catches were doing, so we headed to a street light to get a better look. Once we got there I noticed one of the jar's metal lid was loose, so I held the jar up to the light and sure enough the big yellow spider was gone.

We were upset because we figured he had gotten away and there was no way we would find him again, little lone at night. It was right then I turned over my hand that was holding the jar and had seen this big mother on my hand just chilling out. Now I've never considered myself afraid of spiders but....holy shit did I yell! Soon as my brain processed what was happening I took that glass jar and tossed it 30 feet in the air as I ran around smacking my body as my brain was telling me I was *covered* in spiders, I of course wasn't but it sure felt like it.

After that I never tried catching spiders again because; one it was cruel, but probably more so that idea of having these huge guys walking on me without even being aware of it was not a pleasing sensation. I still would feed the ones near my house, to this day in fact, but from time to time I would think about that silver dollar sized spider on my hand when feeding. I know this was a long comment for a simple gif but watching it made the memory come rushing back, so thought I would share.",1384356326,"then once he was out from hiding we used a stick to grab his web and him and scrape him into a closed mason jar, i know now that this was cruel and unnecessary but unfortunately i can't go back and scold my younger self.","cruel and unnecessary","cruel",NA,FALSE,"cruel and unnecessary","unnecessary",NA,NA,1

"cd5k5kr","&gt;-Why are you guys Atheists? If you knew a God existed (say He presents Himself) would you believe He exists?

I never had a compelling reason not to be, so it just happened. If something presented itself, I would probably believe in that thing, once I'd checked to make sure I wasn't the only one seeing whatever it was. If it identified itself as 'God' I suppose I would call it that.

&gt;-Were you at one point a Christian? What made you change? Do you blame the church?

In school I was taught to be, but I can't say I ever believed it. At first I went through the motions and didn't really think about it at all, like most things I 'learned' at that age. Once I did start to think about it, it seemed very bizarre. These stories, which they presented relatively literally, seemed far less likely than common fiction. Not only that, but while they made it sound like a big deal, there was nothing backing that up. If this 'God' figure existed, and was so very powerful, and felt it was important I believe certain things and acted certain ways, I figured he could take some time from his immortal existence and say 'Hi. I just wanted you to know that I do actually have an existence beyond weird people reading you stories from old books. I get that this is a pretty shaky basis for such fundamental beliefs about, you know, *everything,* so I figured I'd let you know that you really do have an existence beyond a finite lifespan and so paying attention to this stuff isn't such a waste of that as it looks'. But nothing of the sort ever happened. If people didn't tell me about their gods, I'd never have a reason to even consider such a thing, and if any do exist, I imagine it's more likely they don't care about us at all. In fact, if we did turn out to have a creator, I wouldn't be remotely surprised if we were an accident. Maybe even a simulation, or some unethical experiment that never should have been, but would also be unethical to end, and has been left on a shelf to do its thing in isolation ever since it was found out.

&gt;-If a connection with a God could only bring you so much to gain, and nothing to lose, why be an Atheist?

Trying to believe in things that seem likely to be delusions feels very wrong to me. And if it didn't, there are *so many* things I'd prefer to believe in than (at least an Abrahamic) God.

&gt;-Is it possible that a God has allowed for humanity to learn about it's environment to a certain extent? (Meaning: a creationist POV, God controls the extent to which man makes discoveries)

If you mean 'might the world seem this way if this were true' then sure. But so what? Even *The Matrix* has that going for it. It's not hard to think of stories like that, and doesn't really lend them any credibility.

&gt;-Are you angry at a God? Meaning, you voice harsh opinions on this subreddit due to bad experience?

Of course not. What would I be angry about? As far as I can tell, no god has ever done anything for, against, or to me. Even if one existed, I wouldn't be angry at it based on what I know now, because everything done in its name has been people, every promise made in its name has been made by people, every bad thing ever described as its work or hand-waved away with 'god works in mysterious ways' was attributed to it by people. For all I know, if such a thing did exist, it might have blinked and missed all that. It might be looking at us thinking 'this all seems very strange, and frankly cruel, but what right do I have to get in their way?' or it might only just have figured out that *we* exist. It would be a bit harsh to blame all that stuff on it right away, and unless that opportunity arises, as far as I can tell there's no such thing to blame.",1383453494,"it might be looking at us thinking 'this all seems very strange, and frankly cruel, but what right do i have to get in their way?'","cruel, but what","cruel","but",TRUE,"very strange , and frankly cruel","strange","frankly","very",0

"cd1aucs","&gt;If you do not mind telling me, what kind of experience was it that you had and what meaning did it have to you?

Sure, I'll just give a few quick examples. Every time I go into a place of worship there's an incredibly freeing and heavy sense of the Holy Spirit. I don't really know how to describe it, but when you believe that God is hearing what you're singing, He really feels like He's there among you in a way. I don't know if there's a physical certainty that happens with everyone when they feel the Spirit's presence, but think of the feeling a child gets of absolute security and love in their mother's arms. Something to that effect except in public with a bunch of other people at the same time.

I also believe I have heard God speak to me. A famous quote from mother teresa when asked about how she prays was ""well..I just listen, and He listens"" or something to that effect. Peeps in the charismatic movement mostly believe (or I think they do anyway I don't really know much about that movement that I'm apparently a part of) that God speaks to them. So sometimes I approach God with a question or sometimes I just try and listen to Him or, 'interact with His spirit and let it guide me'. Sort of like meditation but you're just thinking about God and trying to hear Him. His voice (I'd say I'm most certain about hearing it maybe 2 or 3 times) has a lot of the same characteristics of His spirit. It's incredibly calming, very peaceful. It's not a booming voice from the sky, it's a small voice from within you, and when you receive an answer to a question you're asking from a small voice inside your head that really blows your mind, it might be God talking. I apologise, you already thought we were crazy now we all sound like schizophrenics (I can't believe I just spelt that right on the first try)-  but you asked haha. 

 
&gt;But other humans have suffered for much longer time than he did.

Sure we can identify time frames, but you can't deny that we don't really have a way to measure who suffered 'worse'. To give an extreme example, I'd much rather have a splinter in my finger for 20 years than get 3 bullets put in my torso or something. Both suck but there's no quantifiable way to say which actually sucked *more*

&gt;Is anything that Yahweh says or does 100% objective moral according to you?

I can't claim to have a formed opinion and have an answer as to why everything Yahweh has ever done is moral, but yeah I'd say it is. To be fair slavery was a part of that culture back then and they weren't treated the same way as African Americans were in more recent centuries. You could buy freedom back then, and even God commands His people to treat slaves fairly and reasonably - he does say that they are lesser than their masters, but He doesn't just give the OK to go ahead and start up a 16 hours a day 7 days a week sweatshop in which you go until you die then bring in the next guy, type deal. That was a messy sentence but I hope you get what I'm saying. 

&gt;Was the mauling of 42 children by two bears sent by Yahweh the best way to deal with kids making fun of a bald prophet? Do you find this to be unreasonable and cruel? Or do you find it to be perfect devine justice?

first of all they were young men, the word there means 'youth' not 6 year old kids. And second of all yeah it does seem to be unreasonable and cruel, but like I've said to a million other things the people back then didn't have a chance at salvation and God knew exactly who they were and what He was doing. For all we know they were screwed until Jesus came any ways. What is 42 young men to 185,000 Assyrians when both were the enemy of the Jews in those times?

&gt;Sorry, the link seems to not be linked properly for some reason, do you mind posting it again? :)

Woops my bad, sorry I was tired lol. Here: http://www.agapebiblestudy.com/charts/Isaiah's%20Messianic%20Prophecies.htm

&gt;This is an unfalsifiable claim and it is made in the name of all religions. My Muslim friends say that the same will happen to those who commit shirk by worshipping other gods than Allah

Yeah I never said I could prove it, it's just what I believe. You're asking me about my beliefs here remember? I can't give you God on a platter lol. 

&gt;On what authority do you reject the message of the Quran? Why are you not worried about Allah's wrath? Why are you not convinced that Islam is the right way? What are your criteria to determine if a religion is false or not?

I dunno they contradict the things I've learned about Jesus and God. Islamic beliefs are a belief system in that you must do things to get to God, it's on humans to get closer to God. Christianity is believing that we're so fucked up that God had to come to us to get us to heaven. No virgin ranking system involved. 

Again it's not like I have proof that Islam isn't right or something, maybe plenty of them do have the right idea, maybe plenty of them do know the God I know but we have the names mixed up. I can't speak against all of them, but some of what they believe I just can't get on board with, I don't see humans being able to earn our way into heaven, I think we're all boned unless we got that dude Jesus taking those sins away from us. 

&gt;They contradict each other. It's so sadistic and unforgiving in it's nature and lacks love and compassion.

Think about it from the opposite perspective. If you're a perfect god, and you create a bunch of vessels who are incapable of doing anything but what qualifies them to be in heaven (good things and being perfect) - how is that loving at all? If I create a computer program that just constantly reels the message 'I love you Jake' (my name is Jake btw), does that computer really love me? 

&gt;I am pretty sure that he feels that his ordeal was worth it.

Is it worth it because He's back in heaven, where He was before, or is it worth it because we now have the opportunity to be in heaven with Him? Why do you think He did what He did on earth? For something to do? To show off? 

&gt;I am sure that you are rejecting all such unfalsifiable claims made by other religions.

What do you mean 'reject' ? I can't really 'reject' them as in prove them wrong, I can just choose not to believe them. If someone put an apple in front of me and told me it was god, I wouldn't believe them because I have no reason to. I believe Jesus is God because in believing that I've felt Him and can tangibly see some of benefit of what He instructs his people to do. Does this mean I can know everything about Him? Nope.

If one thing is unfalsifiable, as in we won't know until we die, but you have reason to believe something else from the same source of that unfalsifiable thing, then I think it makes sense to believe it. I wouldn't blame someone for doing that really. 

It's like if someone buys me a cookie, then I believe they are my friend. Is them thinking I'm a friend falsifiable? Not really. I mean you could ask them but how they really feel about me is still up in the air, who could know how they felt about me? What if they are embarrassed for thinking of me as a friend and lie about it? Is it still unreasonable to think that they believe they're my friend because they bought me a cookie? I dunno that was a pretty sweet cookie and a nice thing to do.

&gt;What I lack is any evidence that shows that the Bible is true.

Yeah you're not really going to get much evidence from this conversation either. I'm cool with continuing to talk about beliefs and theology, but at the end of the day I can't prove to you that Jesus died for your sins and because of Jesus you can get into heaven. I think that should have been obvious from the start that no Christians believe what they believe because they have some kind of tangible evidence proving the whole thing true.

"cd0ntmg","... and it took that long for you to smarten up and put your foot down? 

Seriously, you let a heroin junkie move it. Thats the first problem right there. 

Then it was two months before you even raised the issue of him not paying any rent/bills buying food etc. 

So then this junkie, whos family has been smart enough to no longer let him destroy their lives with his habit, is homeless, so you decide to get him to move in again. By the sound of it you were the one talking your boyfriend into it. Now this is just straight up stupid.

Now im going to go out on a limb here and guess that this guy was still living off of you? I highly doubt a junkie pedophile was paying his equal rent, buying his own food etc etc. But you let him stay for 5 months, and even when you find out hes a pedophile you think 'oh its okay, its not my place to bring up that this heroin junkie, living with me, in my house is flirting with 13 year old kids online and over the phone.'

By the sound of it you'd have continued letting yourself get walked all over, and would have been happy to sit at the sidelines even longer if it wasn't your phone and internet as a pedophile tried to goom a 13 year old...

If all of this wasn't bad enough you then convince your friend and neighbour to take this junkie pedophile in to live with her. This is a junkie pedophile that you know is willing to take advantage and use people as he had done it to you for 2 months prior in the story. 

This is a guy you had caught flirting with 13 year old boys, people at least 5 years younger than him, and people that he, by no means, should be talking to in any sort of sexual manner. This should have been when you told him to get the fuck out before you call the police. 

How 'to your knowledge' was everything going to be great? In the last 5 months prior to him moving you had him tell you himself that he is in love with a 13 yearold. You also know he is a heroin junkie who was unable to lift a finger while living with you the last time and then just disappeared when you brought up the subject of him pulling his own weight.

"cd0l3tj","OK, so. I've worked in many different areas of the Thoroughbred industry: I've worked on stud farms, prepped yearlings for sale, done trackwork and retrained several OTTB's. I've also worked in the sporthorse industry, and I can honestly say that I've witnessed more cruelty, neglect and abuse in the sporthorse industry than I have in any aspect of the racing industry. Lyzzteria hit the nail on the head when they said that bad trainers make it cruel but a good trainer doesn't. And anything terrible that happens in the racing industry is also happening in the sporthorse industry, too. The racing and breeding places I've worked, the horses have been impeccably well-cared for, with riders and strappers who doted on their charges and did everything to ensure their comfort, safety and soundness. I wouldn't have worked there if I thought anything otherwise. 

WRT racing horses young: it's not ideal, and when I back my own horses, I don't start until they're at least 3. However, I've backed and ridden racehorses in pre-training and there's this great myth that they're run into the ground from the moment they turn two. Racing trainers understand the importance of spelling or turning out a horse, to let them mature, to let their bones develop and to keep them mentally happy. When I was riding babies, we'd start backing and mouthing them at about 2, work them for all of about a month and then turn them out for 6 months before bringing them in again to start pre-training. After pre-training, most went back to spelling for a few months before being gradually brought up to race fitness. And the minute a horse started running badly or showing signs of being 'off' (not eating, not enjoying their work, generally being a bit depressed), we'd turn them out for two months. That's more than can be said for most sporthorses, and it makes me really sad that a lot of leisure and competition riders can't see the benefit of leaving their horse alone to be a horse for a month or two every year.

Breakdowns: yes, they happen. Yes, they're inevitable when a horse is working that hard. But they also happen outside of racing, every single day. They happen in eventing. They happen in reining. They happen in fields when a horse takes a corner wrong or misjudges something. Accidents happen. Trainers, riders and strappers take every precaution to avoid these risks. Having a horse off with an injury is expensive for everyone, so from a purely fiscal point of view, it makes sense to look after your horses. Nobody rides lame horses - if you hop on a horse and you feel it's off, you get off straight away and let the trainer know. Heck, we didn't even hand-walk the yearlings if they were lame. 

It's also worth pointing out that conformation plays a huge part in 'breakdowns', and yeah, it's a fault of the breeding aspect of Thoroughbred racing that there are so many horses out there with offset knees and poor joints. But it's not solely due to overwork. It sucks that people feel pressured to race horses with less-than-ideal legs in order to prove the sire or because they think the horse's breeding indicates that it 'should' run well. When the horses are young, owners try their absolute best to trim and shoe correctively to help lessen the likelihood of injury. Some sporthorse and leisure horse owners I know wouldn't even be able to tell if their horse was pigeon toed. I have a retired 24-year-old OTTB mare who raced, and she was happily out eventing until she was 22, sound as anything. If your horse has conformational problems, then it's how you handle it that matters, and trainers and owners do their best not to cause injury to their horses.

Drugging: I have never witnessed drugging, and I've worked the weeks leading up to racedays, the raceday itself, and the weeks following racedays. Nada. The minute I was asked to administer anything that I was unsure of or that I knew was a banned substance, I'd be quitting that job on the spot. 

I can't really speak about the slaughter situation as I live in New Zealand and we have fantastic re-homing rates, with OTTBs being in pretty high demand. However, a large part of the slaughter thing is people not being willing to take on OTTBs because of preconceived notions that racehorses are a.) liable to break down and b.) flighty/difficult/abused, all of which stem from these ideas that the racing industry is inherently cruel and inhumane. This is why it irks me so much that there are these sensationalised defamations of racing, because ultimately, it harms the horses themselves. 

Cruelty toward horses is evident in any aspect of horse owning, breeding, riding and competing. Gaited horses have their feet weighted and sored. Dressage horses are forced into rollkur. Eventers ride unfit horses and injure them. Barrel racers use spiked spurs. Leisure riders let their horses sit in a field and get laminitis, which is ultimately just as cruel as any other kind of neglect. All of these things are not the rule: they are the exception, and we all know how much it sucks when one inhumane person's actions start to represent a whole group. Get to know what really goes on before you pass judgement on the racing industry as a whole.

The problem with this is at some point you'd have to believe something, if you are going so far as to believe what popular opinion is wrong then you have no way to determine what is correct. Every conspiracy here could be just misinformation for all we know and I could be mad. My eye's could be deceiving me, my mind could be overlooking certain facts. How can we know? So being practical, I think there should only be basics of basics which we can 100% say is correct because without it there aren't many reasons to go on. 

In my opinion, the core belief should be that there is something wrong with this world. Why? Because we obviously aren't happy. If we were satisfied with the world, then it means everything is as it should be. But then it makes sense to contemplate the question are humans supposed to be happy? Well it's a difficult question. I think for the majority of humans in this planet are, we obviously always strive for it at least, all of us are always trying to aim for that ideal of the car, the house and money so that we can be entertained. We all strive for happiness in some form or another.Then why are we so critically unhappy even if we get these things? When did the human species become sacrifice at all costs so that we can climb up the social ladder or get shiny bits of metal that everyone covets? When did the costs, environment or social costs become more and more acceptable if it meant we get things we don't need? 

**Indoctrination**. We were TOLD we needed to go to school, we were TOLD we needed to live life on a clock, we were TOLD to eat foods that damaged our bodies and are probably worse than what we had centuries before. Could we honestly say that our life style have improved? In some ways, yes, medicine for example have done wonders to lengthen our life span. Security from predators and dangers that our hunter gather origins had faced are almost gone. But does this mean anything if our quality of life is worse? We are being constantly prodded by society to always move, always work, always exceed. If you don't, you are some kind of failure. Inadequacies built in by media, is it fair that we are held to some impossible standards to live in? I mean unless you are the super rich, our lives are centered around a constant timeline, you follow this timeline until you die. How is this more different than from being a machine? Obviously I am not disputing that learning and hard work isn't important, to achieve any kind of mastery in life you need both. But this fictitious idea of living your life in time doesn't make much sense, in a way time doesn't even exist, the cliche line ""you live in the present"" is still true. But we live our life in the future, we work so we can get money at a later date rather than because you enjoy what you are doing in the present. Will you be happy in the future? How are you sure? What in the past has shown this to be true? Were you ever fully satisfied for more than the time it took you to spend your money? So then what is society based upon? 

**Addiction** Like a heroin junkie looking for his next fix, we live our lives constantly thinking about how great it's going to be once we have that car we always wanted, that house you just passed by and the sexy girl you saw in a club. That is how society works, they give us crack in the form of TV, they give us cocaine in the form of video games, they give us alcohol so we can get wasted and they measure women by their looks so that women will pay ridiculous sums of money to look a shade more beautiful by THEIR standards. But are these intrinsically human qualities? NO. So where has this mass lunacy come from, why has this hallucination taken hold in our brains? 

**The rich**. Isn't it strange that while everyone else scrambles to meet to these impossible standards, apart from the few lucky ones blessed with good genetics, the super elite as it were, there exists dynasties of families who seem to be living life without worries. They can get whatever they want, without working, without enhancing mankind and maybe detrimental to mankind. How do these people keep everyone in line? How do they get you to cut their grass, drive their cars and build their mansions? 

**Money**. But what is money to the average human being? From the dawn of mankind, was money a necessity, was it part of your genetic code? Would you have died if you did not have money? Could you not just survive off the land itself? NO. So then why does it have so much control over us, if it doesn't seem to hold any intrinsic value to the average person? Sure it has value to the rich, they can do whatever they want with it. While we ration between providing for our families and entertainment which has no long lasting value to us. But so why does it have control of us? 

**Power**. Money is power. Power over all other humans, with enough money you can buy anything physical, you go down to your store you have the power to buy a packet of cigarettes, a steak if you wanted. You go to a person you can even buy their time, they will work for you depending on how much you give them. But in all of these things, another human being can refuse, they can steal, they can burn the piece of papers. Why they don't do this? 

**Government**. They uphold the currency. They do not work for the common people. That is a fallacy, if a person can lose his house because of medical bills to the bank and the government won't defend them, but a rich guy get's his Rolex stolen the government will defend them, who are they working for? Obviously its the rich. The system is a game, we all play for piece of the pie while most of the pie is in the hands of the rich. It's unnecessarily cruel, but arguably fair? NO. 

**Corruption**. If the game was fair, the concentration of wealth would be evenly distributed. if it was all about chance there is no way only a fraction of a fraction of people would own such a big portion of everything there is to be had. You could argue these men were just smarter and they can systematically play the game better than the average human being. But does that account for the massive wealth gap? NO. 
****************************************************************************
**tldr;** They beat the game by artificially keeping everyone else down, it's not that they are the best, it's just that we have been **Indoctrinated** to run in a rat wheel so that we can satisfy our **addiction** while **the rich** get our generated power in the form of **money** which also gives them **power** over us and this system is protected by the **government** so that we are held down by this **corrupt** system. 

That's my big conspiracy, it's obvious, everyone can see it, everyone has felt it, but we are powerless to stop it. We are addicts and we are comfortable.

When did the costs, environment or social costs become more and more acceptable if it meant we get things we don't need? 

**Indoctrination**. We were TOLD we needed to go to school, we were TOLD we needed to live life on a clock, we were TOLD to eat foods that damaged our bodies and are probably worse than what we had centuries before. Could we honestly say that our life style have improved? In some ways, yes, medicine for example have done wonders to lengthen our life span. Security from predators and dangers that our hunter gather origins had faced are almost gone. But does this mean anything if our quality of life is worse? We are being constantly prodded by society to always move, always work, always exceed. If you don't, you are some kind of failure. Inadequacies built in by media, is it fair that we are held to some impossible standards to live in? I mean unless you are the super rich, our lives are centered around a constant timeline, you follow this timeline until you die. How is this more different than from being a machine? Obviously I am not disputing that learning and hard work isn't important, to achieve any kind of mastery in life you need both. But this fictitious idea of living your life in time doesn't make much sense, in a way time doesn't even exist, the cliche line ""you live in the present"" is still true. But we live our life in the future, we work so we can get money at a later date rather than because you enjoy what you are doing in the present. Will you be happy in the future? How are you sure? What in the past has shown this to be true? Were you ever fully satisfied for more than the time it took you to spend your money? So then what is society based upon? 

**Addiction** Like a heroin junkie looking for his next fix, we live our lives constantly thinking about how great it's going to be once we have that car we always wanted, that house you just passed by and the sexy girl you saw in a club. That is how society works, they give us crack in the form of TV, they give us cocaine in the form of video games, they give us alcohol so we can get wasted and they measure women by their looks so that women will pay ridiculous sums of money to look a shade more beautiful by THEIR standards. But are these intrinsically human qualities? NO. So where has this mass lunacy come from, why has this hallucination taken hold in our brains? 

**The rich**. Isn't it strange that while everyone else scrambles to meet to these impossible standards, apart from the few lucky ones blessed with good genetics, the super elite as it were, there exists dynasties of families who seem to be living life without worries. They can get whatever they want, without working, without enhancing mankind and maybe detrimental to mankind. How do these people keep everyone in line? How do they get you to cut their grass, drive their cars and build their mansions? 

**Money**. But what is money to the average human being? From the dawn of mankind, was money a necessity, was it part of your genetic code? Would you have died if you did not have money? Could you not just survive off the land itself? NO. So then why does it have so much control over us, if it doesn't seem to hold any intrinsic value to the average person? Sure it has value to the rich, they can do whatever they want with it. While we ration between providing for our families and entertainment which has no long lasting value to us. But so why does it have control of us? 

**Power**. Money is power. Power over all other humans, with enough money you can buy anything physical, you go down to your store you have the power to buy a packet of cigarettes, a steak if you wanted. You go to a person you can even buy their time, they will work for you depending on how much you give them. But in all of these things, another human being can refuse, they can steal, they can burn the piece of papers. Why they don't do this? 

**Government**. They uphold the currency. They do not work for the common people. That is a fallacy, if a person can lose his house because of medical bills to the bank and the government won't defend them, but a rich guy get's his Rolex stolen the government will defend them, who are they working for? Obviously its the rich. The system is a game, we all play for piece of the pie while most of the pie is in the hands of the rich. It's unnecessarily cruel, but arguably fair? NO. 

**Corruption**. If the game was fair, the concentration of wealth would be evenly distributed. if it was all about chance there is no way only a fraction of a fraction of people would own such a big portion of everything there is to be had. You could argue these men were just smarter and they can systematically play the game better than the average human being. But does that account for the massive wealth gap? NO. 
****************************************************************************
**tldr;** They beat the game by artificially keeping everyone else down, it's not that they are the best, it's just that we have been **Indoctrinated** to run in a rat wheel so that we can satisfy our **addiction** while **the rich** get our generated power in the form of **money** which also gives them **power** over us and this system is protected by the **government** so that we are held down by this **corrupt** system. 

That's my big conspiracy, it's obvious, everyone can see it, everyone has felt it, but we are powerless to stop it. We are addicts and we are comfortable.

"ccbjxna","Pussy: It's an sarcastic song, about how prostitution was (is?) legal in Germany, yet German men still go to foreign countries and want/expect sex. they said in an interview that the song is mocking the sex-tourism industry.


Reise Resie: The album is based on the crash of Japan Airlines Flight 123 on the evening of August 12, 1985. Twelve minutes into its flight, the Boeing 747 suffered an explosive decompression due to failure of its rear pressure bulkhead, caused by a faulty repair years earlier. 

The album ""revels in the type of paradoxical, multi-faceted existentialism which comes second nature to Germans but is persistently untranslatable to Americans"" and it opens with the track ""Reise Reise"" which means ""journey, journey"", and ""we are immediately put on notice that this particular journey will be a grim and harrowing one, leavened by German existentialism in the grand tradition of Mann and Goethe.""

The song ""Amerika"" deals with the worldwide influence of the culture of the United States of America. The song's two verses are sung in German with a chorus in English: ""We're all living in Amerika, Amerika ist wunderbar, We're all living in Amerika, Amerika, Amerika."" The band views it as a satirical commentary on ""Americanization"", and it features mentions of Coca-Cola, Mickey Mouse, and Santa Claus.

Anyway, the first time I heard Benzin, I thought it was about self-destructive behavior, like drinking alcohol in excess (high-proof liquor could be compared to gasoline :). But upon listening to it more, I kind of came to the same conclusions as the other people here about a 21st century addiction to oil.

Haifisch:  Rammstein are the sharks. They look dangerous and cruel, but they also have their sensitive side invisible to outside observers. No one else can see the tears of the sharks, yet their sorrows are so great that they turn the seas salty.

Really though, the song seems to be mostly word-play with ""halten"". The word is used is many different ways: stay, endure, hold, keep, and stop. In English, ""halt"" still has the meaning ""stop"", but maybe the word ""hold"" also comes from the German ""halt"". A question for linguists, and a nice example of the poet at play.

Mein Land: 
In this case, it's a conversation between a flag-bearing nationalist against immigration who believes he has a mandate from the Heavens to kick immigrants out of his land and immigrants who enter his country (possibly Muslim if you consider the type of beat in the beginning of the song). Rammstein is not known to take pro right-wing stances (Links 2-3-4), so I believe it's a criticism against anti-immigration, e.g. ""Nowhere can I stay"", response: ""My land"". They are known to make amazing poetry with controversy.

Liebe ist fur alle da: This song is about a person who is so lonely and love-deprived that he feels the need to be loved by any means necessary. The person sees a beautiful girl and wants her to love him, so he rapes her. He thinks that will make her love him and now he can have love too.
It can also be about a couple that is already in a relationship or married. And the man (husband) in the relationship isn’t feeling his partner (wife) is doing her part in the relationship after all he has done when it comes to loving him as much as he loves her. So rather then cheating on her, he wants to remain faithful to his feelings and commitment to her, despite her now not loving him anymore physically making him feel cheated.

This song feels almost like a continuation of Feuer and Wasser, but it also recalls some of the same feelings as Du Reichst So Gut. Although Du Reichst doesn’t mention water directly, it does say that he touches her “wet skin”.

Another similarity between the two songs is how he tells the woman in Du Reischt not to resist and in Leibe is Fur Alle, he talks about how she doesn’t resist, even though she’s apparently crying, so whatever is happening is not something that she wants.

The water theme is all through out Feuer and Wasser as is the singer’s apparent feelings of rejection and inferiority. He is in this girl’s shadow so all he can do is clumsily reach out and grab for her with wet hands. In liebe, he’s still watching a woman, or women in the water, still feeling isolated, inferior, unlovable, but this time instead of just impotently reaching out as the object of his desire slides past, he takes matters into his own hands and “makes” her love him.


Donaukinder:
The song deals with an accident near Baia Mare, in Romania, which occurred on 30th Januar 2000.

Extremely heavy rainfall on 30 January caused a dam to breach, causing 100.000 m³ of water to flood a goldmine and carry with it app. 100 ton of heavy metals and sodium cyanide into the nearby river Donau (German name for the Danube). The poison was carried along the river, causing havoc in several countries; drinking water became poisoned, and people fled the rivers’ surroundings to escape the deadly poison, which quickly destroyed all life in and around the river itself.

Lots of children were obviously affected by this disaster, but the name ‘Donaukinder’ (‘Danube Children’) more probably refers metaphorically to the fish in the river, seen as the ‘children’ of the Danube/Donau; the fish obviously suffered most directly the full force of this disaster and the absence of fish in the river is the most obvious consequence of the disaster. Hence, the song rhetorically asks: ‘Wo sind die Kinder?’ (‘Where are the children?’). Furthermore, the German name for Baia Mare, where the breach occured, is ‘Frauenbach’, meaning ‘Woman-River’, which sustains the metaphor of comparing River/Fish to Mother/Children.

After consolidating my starting provinces by revokation and being a total douche tyrant, I managed to eventually become King of Sicily. (realy not hard when you start with 50%, but hey)

Due to his fascination with the Greek Empire Eadwulf decided to swear fealty to the Byzantines and convert to Greek and Orthodox culture.

Nearly a decade later once again all of Sicily was under his control. Still not dying, but instead becoming possessed, he spend the next few years happily expanding invardly, making his sons dukes in southern italy. Then the emperors disastrous campaign against the Turks left him with 300 men and in prison of the Seljuk Sultan. It was then than Eadwulf was appointed Regent and the general opinion in the Empire shifted definitely in the direction of Konstantine X being a dimwit unfit to rule his deceased grandmother.

Not long after, the duke of Athens made a coup and crowned himself emperor. This did not sit well with our ruler, who was a devout believer in the divinity of the Basileus, and he promptly declared the most one-sided civil war I have ever seen. Every duke save two in Anatolia and the Varagian guard captain joined in on Eadwulfs side and shortly afterwards he was Byzantine Emperor. 

Even though now old he stilll managed to rule for a little more than ten years before dying peacefully in bed.

It does however mean it has become normalised to a degree that most would see as unacceptable.  That said, on its own it isn't necessarily torturous (it can be, no idea if it is in this instance).

But then there has also been a drive in the US to minimize 'torture', the idea that waterboarding isn't torture and then the diversion of all discussion of US use of torture into a discussion about waterboarding and other enhanced interrogation techniques (which all are torture, it's just more palatable to apply a different term and discuss whether they might not be when the US uses them).

First: Take your own birth control in hand. Get a vasectomy. Wear a condom that you have bought/unwrapped for each sexual encounter.


Second: Ask your wife why she thinks a baby will make her less alone, incomplete, etc.  If she truly feels its worth the tiredness, the anger, etc, then you can't really make her change her mind. The only thing you can do is offer your point of view. 


Third: Make it clear to her what your stance is. Tell her how you feel about this decision without trying to undermine her. Also, tell her if you will stay or not if she decides to push ahead. From this post, it sounds like if she decided to have children, you would divorce. It may sound harsh and cruel, but it's the truth. Do not give her the idea that if she had an oops you would be there every step of the way. 


Fourth: Be emotionally and physically prepared to leave if this is something she really wants. It sucks and it may hurt, but children are a life altering decision and if she wants it.... She can have it, but not with you.

That's what death is – not existing.  I feel that in order to truly appreciate life, we must all come to terms with the unknown(s) death really brings and this must be done in an genuinely honest manner.

The simple truth is that we have *absolutely no answer* as to what happens afterwards and it doesn't matter what anyone would prefer to believe in relation to it.  

If you approach this truthfully, it's reasonable to assume one would find any desire for an ""after"" life to be the result of loving the beautiful parts of the life we currently possess.  Why else would you grieve its ending?  Because love feels so damn good.  Because it's amazing to be the cause of another human being's smile.  Because we don't ever want to let go of that special someone's hand.  Because we don't ever want to stop hearing their voices.  Because stomping puddles is fun and watching the sunset can be breathtaking.  Because it's comforting to fall asleep to the sound of rain and it's even better to do it while snuggling.

I can only speculate a possible scenario where I am an SS Officer or member of the Nazi party.  I have been told my whole life that what I am doing is right and just, that it will benefit mankind.  Perhaps I have a wife, I have children of my own, my own life to live and people who rely on me.  One day I am ordered to shoot some strangers I have never met, or else I will be shot instead or perhaps even worse, my family will be tortured and killed.  Perhaps guilt does spring up in my heart, perhaps I realize that what I'm doing isn't ""right"" by the standards of the world and all things good and clean and pretty.  I may even realize to do it would be monstrous and cruel, but I would know that doing it would mean another chance to live and see my family again and to spare this stranger's life would mean to die and risk my family.  Now, you may say it is cruel and selfish to value your family above a stranger, but this man or monster whichever you prefer is only human.  Perhaps he knows that the stranger's life is forfeit either way, that if he chooses not to do it he will have a clean conscience only long enough till he realizes he stopped and thwarted nothing and only put those he loves at risk.  That he will only feel so clean and righteous long enough for the bullet to smear his life over the grounds next to countless others and his place to be immediately filled by another monster.  There's nothing honorable in death, there's nothing you can do or help as a corpse.  There is no difference between the corpse of a saint and a sinner.

There's no right decision.  There's no decision that makes the sun come out and the flowers blossom.

"cauvajn","Short Answer: Tell her everything.

Long answer: My wife was in college and a similar thing happened. The guy that she was having sex with had a long term girlfriend. They eventually ended up being a triad for awhile but my wife found out that she had no idea that he was sleeping around behind her back long before she was introduced. She told her, simply because it was the right thing to do. 

We are poly and she does have relationships outside of our own. One incident happened a few years ago, of which I will not go into too much detail. However, this guy stated that he was also poly and assured her that his wife knew everything that was going on. They ended up meeting at an event in New Orleans and hooked up. Later that same weekend, she ran into his wife and they chatted for a few minutes and it dawn on her that she had NO clue what was going on. Again, she told her and watched both of their worlds shatter because of the lies and distrust that came from it.

Guys that play people like this are who give males the bad reputation that I fight against on a daily basis. There is no reason for distrust, lies or the pain of eventual truth if people were just honest about their intents. Sure, he may not get to fuck that hot chick and that's just too damn bad in my opinion. There is too much pain and suffering on a daily basis that adding to it in this way just to get your rocks off is not only cruel but sadistic and sociopathic. Contact the girl, give her the info, even if she doesn't believe it, she will at least know and will eventually be prepared for the betrayal and lies that this douchebag is spreading.

Excluding war, just to make it easy, he murdered a soldier for snoring, attempted to murder Loras, attempted to murder Sandor and it's implied he murdered his sister, his father, several of his wives and many servants.

Killing off short people is eugenics, killing off unintelligent people is eugenics, killing off unhealthy or ugly people are eugenics. Killing off poor people isn't. 

Being poor has no genetic link. You are generally poor because of society, not because of inferior genes. Just like being rich doesn't mean you have superior genes. 

He uses an example of a lower class single mom and an upper class woman as an example. The lower class mother spreads her bad genes to many kids, and the upper class spreads her good genes. 

Except oh wait there is a problem! Just because one mother is lower class doesn't mean she has worse genes, or vice versa.

She's the kind of person that everyone has encountered, or will encounter, at some point in their lives, and some will be involved in a situation just like this one.

Sometimes guys *really* like a girl and don't care about only looks, however, they're still going to try and find aspects that they can change, one of which may be appearance.

It's not a ""unique-to-men"" phenomenon as women also try and change people in relationships, just less so in terms of appearance. I'd venture you've tried to change some habit or aspect of a guy you dated as well. You'd probably consider your aspect of habit changes as ""just suggestions"" and in no way as offensive as commenting on weight, but on a base level, changing someone is what you're debating here. 

To be honest, because of the culture (an insensitive - male centric/patriarchal one) many guys grow up in they (we) tend to be cold and lack tact in expressing our thoughts about others.

This may seem cruel but many inexperienced pet owners want to get a lizard and think sand is a good idea. Always use 100% pure sand, don't use any of that calcium or vitamin fortified sand. Improper sand with leopard geckos can lead to a clogged belly or 'impaction'. They can't pass the sand, so it fills their belly until they starve, or literally burst.

They get the sand in their mouths when they hunt. Since they eat crickets, which are the easiest food to get for a lizard, they will chase them down and pounce on them, sometimes taking a bit of substrate (what lines the cage e.g. sand, coconut fiber, dirt, hydro balls, magnolia leaves etc.) and starting an impaction.

"cacso1m","I can't give a specific answer to this question. In fact, there may be no specific answer except to say that many pirates were cruel, and outrages can be found among pirates of all eras and cultures. Part of the confusion derives from the blinders of ideology, nationalism, and so forth. The English, French, and Dutch, for example, considered the Spanish to be perpetrators of outrages against not only the common seamen of their enemies, but also against Native Americans, yet English, French, and Dutch sea rovers committed their own outrages against the Spanish. Europeans commonly damned the Barbary corsairs (a corsair is a privateer, not a pirate, and the Barbary corsairs were exactly that, privateers, for they were lawfully authorized by their governments) as cruel slave traders, even as Europeans enslaved not only West Africans, but, though to a much lesser degree, North Africans. The difference, of course, to the European mind was that Africans were inferior and the Barbary corsairs weren't Christians. The sin, so to speak, of Barbary corsairs was that they enslaved white Christians. 

Pirates, by virtue of their desire to seek material gain by force of arms, were a largely ungoverned and cruel lot. Lady Cheng I Sao's Chinese pirates perpetrated cruelties and murders among rich and poor Chinese, just as Caribbean pirates perpetrated cruelties, as did Muslim corsairs on Christians and Christian pirates and privateers on Muslims. All pirates were addicted to slave trading and human trafficking in general. 

In other words, piracy was a cruel, bloodthirsty business in which crews were largely ungoverned in the aftermath of an attack. It is thus almost impossible to say which pirates were the most cruel. I could split hairs and consider which pirates were considered most cruel, but this is relative. Christians thought Barbary corsairs were the most cruel, the English thought Spanish pirates were more cruel than English pirates, and so forth.

"ca5gg95","I do want to say that I agree with about 95% of the points you've made.  The thing I find repeatedly appalling is the consent argument which is blatantly hypocritical and flies in the face of everything else we do and are allowed to do to animals.

We do not allow cruelty, sexual relationships, and marriage of animals for *entirely different reasons*.

For example, what you've basically claimed is that it's commonly accepted that raping livestock is necessary.  And yes, I am using the word rape here.  Because if you are apply the concept of consent to animals, then artificial insemination is in fact rape.  Not to mention the fact that artificial insemination isn't even necessary (and contrary to good practice in many countries), but that's irrelevant. It's still rape if consent is required.  Note that I do not consider it rape to artificially inseminate an animal, but your consent argument dictates it.

By the way, I studied the genealogy of beef and ratios of 1:10,000 are common in certain breeds thanks to artificial insemination.  This is common in much of the meat industry, but it is also not practiced in many other countries where natural and unforced breeding is practiced.

It is also quite ironic that we talk about humans being noble in protecting animals from non-consensual sex, when in fact we are the very source of non-consensual sex among livestock.  In animal husbandry school, if an animal is unwilling to mate or doesn't understand, you manually force the animals to mate (the male is usually more than happy to participate in this rape when you help him out).  Nobody bats an eye, and why should they.  Consent is a human concept which is extremely hypocritical to apply to animals.  So are gangbangs.  Nobody would call this a gangbang, but here we are and your argument again dictates the terminology.

We also can and do tattoo our own names on animals to mark them as our property.  We can clip their wings so they can't fly anymore for our convenience.  We can even film everything we do and put it online for the public to see.  It is ironic that we make a consent argument on the things an animal is willing to do anyways, but run off with our tails between our legs the moment we talk about everything animals are unwilling and horrified to participate in.  It reminds me of when we found out that animals at a slaughterhouse were intelligent enough to understand they were about to die and there was nothing they could do about it, and most people didn't give a fuck and kept on eating them.

Animal cruelty without a good reason is illegal.  Animal cruelty with a good reason (saving money) is perfectly legal.  There is more than one way to slaughter an animal for food or keep hens for making eggs, and the vast majority of the time we choose the cruel but legal methods.  You get to make this choice every time you buy meat or eggs at the grocer.

Animals also would not, nor cannot consent to being killed just to save money and free up space.  Killing an animal to save money or merely out of laziness or even forgetfulness is absolutely legal.  We can even kill animals *for fun* as long as it isn't done in an unreasonably cruel way.  Shoot a defenseless animal in the head?  There's a fucking license for it!

Humans have no moral justification for a carte blanche to kill animals.  We don't even have a strong moral justification just to kill for meat.  Our justifications are entirely practical.

Bottom line, legal arguments don't work because these laws explicitly do not cover animals and if they did then else we do to animals becomes illegal anyways.  Equating human rights with animal rights here is also absurd, considering we don't have a leg to stand on when it comes to animals.  Frankly speaking, human beings have the most hypocritical relationship to animals possible and the only real argument we have in our favor is what is practical and sensible to reasonable people.",1369438340,"there is more than one way to slaughter an animal for food or keep hens for making eggs, and the vast majority of the time we choose the cruel but legal methods.","cruel but legal","cruel","but",FALSE,"cruel but legal","legal",NA,NA,1

1. Truth and honesty are overrated. People only end up hurt/offended/hating you if you are always honest - a lot of things are better kept a secret, 'cause no one benefits from their surfacing.

2. People belong to different 'classes' and they can only have a successful relationship with someone from their 'class'. For example fat/skinny people - with fat/skinny (including a fat with a skinny, not only fat-fat) people. Even if someone gross, but rich is with a beautiful, sexy chick, she is most probably stupid, so it compensates and she belongs in this guy's 'class'.

3. It is normal for people to change their behavior and stop living the way they used to and stop talking as much to their old friends and relatives, when said people become rich/famous. It is not a good thing for the non-progressing people to pull the successful people back dragging them through guilt trips. (I'm not rich/successful... yet ;) )

4. Africa is a resource-sucking black hole. Rich/pseudo-sophisticated non-African people use it as a way to make themselves look virtuous and make themselves feel better about themselves.

"c9yn272","&gt;**His Name Is Robert Downey Jr.**


&gt;I’m willing to go out on a limb here and guess that most stories of kindness do not begin with drug addicted celebrity bad boys.
&gt;
&gt;Mine does.
&gt;
&gt;His name is Robert Downey Jr.
&gt;
&gt;You’ve probably heard of him. You may or may not be a fan, but I am, and I was in the early 90’s when this story takes place.
&gt;
&gt;It was at a garden party for the ACLU of Southern California. My stepmother was the executive director, which is why I was in attendance without having to pay the $150 fee. It’s not that I don’t support the ACLU, it’s that I was barely twenty and had no money to speak of.
&gt;
&gt;I was escorting my grandmother. There isn’t enough room in this essay to explain to you everything she was, I would need volumes, so for the sake of brevity I will tell you that she was beautiful even in her eighties, vain as the day is long, and whip smart, though her particular sort of intelligence did not encompass recognizing young celebrities.
&gt;
&gt;I pointed out Robert Downey Jr. to her when he arrived, in a gorgeous cream-colored linen suit, with Sarah Jessica Parker on his arm. My grandmother shrugged, far more interested in piling her paper plate with various unidentifiable cheeses cut into cubes. He wasn’t Carey Grant or Gregory Peck. What did she care?
&gt;
&gt;The afternoon’s main honoree was Ron Kovic, whose story of his time in the Vietnam War that had left him confined to a wheelchair had recently been immortalized in the Oliver Stone film Born on the Fourth of July.
&gt;
&gt;I mention the wheelchair because it played an unwitting role in what happened next.
&gt;
&gt;We made our way to our folding chairs in the garden with our paper plates and cubed cheeses and we watched my stepmother give one of her eloquent speeches and a plea for donations, and there must have been a few other people who spoke but I can’t remember who, and then Ron Kovic took the podium, and he was mesmerizing, and when it was all over we stood up to leave, and my grandmother tripped.
&gt;
&gt;We’d been sitting in the front row (nepotism has its privileges) and when she tripped she fell smack into the wheelchair ramp that provided Ron Kovic with access to the stage. I didn’t know that wheelchair ramps have sharp edges, but they do, at least this one did, and it sliced her shin right open.
&gt;
&gt;The volume of blood was staggering.
&gt;
&gt;I’d like to be able to tell you that I raced into action; that I quickly took control of the situation, tending to my grandmother and calling for the ambulance that was so obviously needed, but I didn’t. I sat down and put my head between my knees because I thought I was going to faint. Did I mention the blood?
&gt;
&gt;Luckily, somebody did take control of the situation, and that person was Robert Downey Jr.
&gt;
&gt;He ordered someone to call an ambulance. Another to bring a glass of water. Another to fetch a blanket. He took off his gorgeous linen jacket and he rolled up his sleeves and he grabbed hold of my grandmother’s leg, and then he took that jacket that I’d assumed he’d taken off only to it keep out of the way, and he tied it around her wound. I watched the cream colored linen turn scarlet with her blood.
&gt;
&gt;He told her not to worry. He told her it would be alright. He knew, instinctively, how to speak to her, how to distract her, how to play to her vanity. He held onto her calf and he whistled. He told her how stunning her legs were.
&gt;
&gt;She said to him, to my humiliation: “My granddaughter tells me you’re a famous actor but I’ve never heard of you.”
&gt;
&gt;He stayed with her until the ambulance came and then he walked alongside the stretcher holding her hand and telling her she was breaking his heart by leaving the party so early, just as they were getting to know each other. He waved to her as they closed the doors. “Don’t forget to call me, Silvia,” he said. “We’ll do lunch.”
&gt;
&gt;He was a movie star, after all.
&gt;
&gt;Believe it or not, I hurried into the ambulance without saying a word. I was too embarrassed and too shy to thank him.
&gt;
&gt;We all have things we wish we’d said. Moments we’d like to return to and do differently. Rarely do we get that chance to make up for those times that words failed us. But I did. Many years later.
&gt;
&gt;I should mention here that when Robert Downey Jr. was in prison for being a drug addict (which strikes me as absurd and cruel, but that’s the topic for a different essay), I thought of writing to him. Of reminding him of that day when he was humanity personified. When he was the best of what we each can be. When he was the kindest of strangers.
&gt;
&gt;But I didn’t.
&gt;
&gt;Some fifteen years after that garden party, ten years after my grandmother had died and five since he’d been released from prison, I saw him in a restaurant.
&gt;
&gt;I grew up in Los Angeles where celebrity sightings are commonplace and where I was raised to respect people’s privacy and never bother someone while they’re out having a meal, but on this day I decided to abandon the code of the native Angeleno, and my own shyness, and I approached his table.
&gt;
&gt;I said to him, “I don’t have any idea if you remember this…” and I told him the story.
&gt;
&gt;He remembered.
&gt;
&gt;“I just wanted to thank you,” I said. “And I wanted to tell you that it was simply the kindest act I’ve ever witnessed.”
&gt;
&gt;He stood up and he took both of my hands in his and he looked into my eyes and he said, “You have absolutely no idea how much I needed to hear that today.”

I've told him how I've felt, only for it to be overlooked. I've stepped up to the plate on his holidays, as a sort of example of, ok, *this* is what I would like you to do. Nothing.

"c9rycuj","I remember learning about ""life stages"" in high school (quite a few yrs ago).  Altruism was an attribute of the ""Golden Years.""  It can be hard to see the good in humanity when you're a young adult because you're still recovering from the disillusionment you've experienced entering the world from childhood.  Eventually, it seems, you learn to accept the harsh reality that human nature can be ugly and cruel, but choose to focus on the good humanity is capable of.

My Grandfather, a Korean War vet, was in the Battle of the Chosin Reservoir. Those men saw the worst humanity is capable of, and found themselves doing horrible things just to survive.  However, my earliest memories of him were always of a gentle and personable man.  Everyone he's ever met seems to pick up on his good spirit.  I am lucky enough to still have him in my life, and he is still always accentuating the positive in life.  He always defends the nature of man, and tells me to look for the good in people and respect them.

Long story short, faith in humanity is an acquired belief.

"c9k3ppp","On the surface this may not be the most aesthetically pleasing track to a lot of listeners. However, I find it to be extremely visceral and poignant, especially after learning the meaning/background of the song.

After being diagnosed with terminal cancer, rapper Camu Tao recorded (but did not finish) the album King Of Hearts, which has a totally different sound than any of his previous work. Not for everyone, the album has a lot of potential gems, but the most to-the-point is this track, Death. This is his head-on-collision with what is likely his last publicly exposed dilemma, and a question we might all be wise to ask at some point, ""Death, where have you been all my life?""

I find this track to be culturally valuable, a sort of [Death Poem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_poem) for a modern generation. I love the way he uses metaphor to compare his demise to a female acquaintance, a cruel but unavoidable mistress. And while I'm not as familiar with or as much of a fan of some of his other work, I find the revelations in this track to be a sort of equalizer... even if the overall sound of the track isn't inline with your tastes (as is the opinion of many fans of his earlier work), you may find that the notions expressed are a bit more universal and worth pondering.

There are several other tracks on this album I quite enjoy, so if you don't mind it sounding a little rough, unfinished, and get a kick out of the bad singing, you may give the rest a listen as well.

"c9jmzkr","Well, that's just my experience, right? I personally choose not to date bisexual identified women because of that experience. I think the problem is not that homos dislike bisexuals - I think the issue is that people who insist they have *zero* preference are usually the type who will also cheat, and turn around and blame their sexuality. You should also be aware of the girls in high school and college who make out with other girls at parties, then go home with their boyfriends, tittering about how they're so bisexual. They give you guys a bad name.

The thing is, I personally believe the gay spectrum has almost nothing to do with bisexuals - being gay is about a preference. I like women best, so that's who I date. Because of that preference, I'm often treated like a second-class citizen. The LGBTQ is meant to support people like me, because the world treats us badly. We're part of a group that has no choice.

Bisexuals, not so much. Being bisexual means you can date one or the other and it really is a choice. You could make your life easier and date a man. It sounds arrogant, but it's totally true. I came out as bisexual, at first - I was on the bi now, gay later plan. But I realized I had a preference, and went to the side of the spectrum that fits. This was before being a lesbian was cute - I came out in 1997, when people were still being murdered on a very regular basis for sleeping with the ""wrong"" people. A bisexual, by the very definition, could choose to live a seemingly straight life and be content with that.

I think, honestly, people just don't like bisexuals because it sometimes feels like it belittles what the rest of us endure on a daily basis. *""Someone gay bashed you? Go get a partner of the opposite gender and your problems are solved!""*

I have no problem with people being bisexual - I've dated men, and I've liked the men I've dated. I haven't managed to meet a bio man I'd consider dating in the last while, but that doesn't absolutely preclude the idea that there is a bio man out there who I would date, in the future. It isn't something I'm actively seeking, but it isn't unfamiliar ground, either.

With that said, my opinion is simple: if you prefer women, you're a lesbian. You can still sleep with a man now and then - there are no lesbian police. Sexuality is totally fluid, and I identify as queer because I have a serious thing for FTM tranny boys. Stating that I am a lesbian means lying about that, or belittling a tranny boy's identity, which is stupid and cruel. But I won't identify as bisexual, because I don't like the stigma that comes with it, and I am rarely open to dating biological males.

I know that all of this could be considered arrogant, and I don't want you to think I'm being an ass or anything. I really just wanted to explain my thoughts on the subject to possibly give you something to consider. It might make your life easier, and it could help to give you a bit more enlightenment on the stigma attached to identifying as bisexual.

Personally, if I were you, I'd just tell people I liked women and sometimes men. That doesn't make you bisexual, it makes you open-minded.

* Trying to attack it by enlisting your bosses will not be helpful. Then people will just gossip about how you're a nark and boring or whatever.

* Learn to make jokes. Diverting nasty gossip with a joke is a lot more successful than pointed criticism. No one wants to feel bad about their gossiping but if you remind them gently with humor it can be effective.

* If someone says something negative about another person, don't outright deny it (unless it's about something you were witness to). Denying the negative comment will be counter-productive and make the gossiper resent you.

* Turn the conversation around by changing the subject to something related but not directed at the subject. Go with the flow of conversation as much as possible. 

* Accept the fact that people gossip because they feel it bonds them with the people around them. (I don't care to debate whether or not this is true.) It is a habit picked up from friends or family and they are NEVER going to stop.

* Accept the fact that NOT learning to get along with people will only impede you later in life: Developing relationships and accepting the faults of others will often determine how successful you are in the world.

* You don't have to feel guilty if you don't defend the subject of the gossip. You're doing your part by just not feeding into it.

"c8ydw1d","Ah yes, the Hojo quotes that every Sephiroth theory fan uses.
Did you read the line properly? He states that he created Cloud 5 years ago. On top of that, Hojo, too, is infected with Jenova cells. He's also a maniac, so to take anything he says as factual is a mistake, especially considering he's already shown lying by saying he created Cloud 5 years ago as a clone to Sephiroth.

And why would Sephiroth want to control the clones? He's got no use for it, what's the purpose to control the clones? Jenova uses the clones to make her whole again, but what does Sephiroth have got to do with it?
Aside from that, how is he going to diffuse his will? What ability does he have to do so? Jenova couldn't do it, as the planet outright rejects her. Sephiroth isn't part of the Lifestream either, he travelled through it, but isn't part of it, so how is he going to diffuse his will?

The next line is so typical as well. Sephiroth's will or not, it doesn't state that his will is stronger than Jenova.

Then the Cloud line: He's here. The real Sephiroth is just beyond here. It's both incredibly wicked and cruel... But **it's** releasing a powerfully strong will from deep within this planet's wound.

Elaborate. Why would Cloud talk about Sephiroth, but then refer to Sephiroth as it, as opposed to he? 
And whatever Hojo says, he's known to be lying, he has Jenova cells in him and we know he's a bit crazy. Most things he says I take with a grain of salt.

&gt; Sephiroth moved Jenova at that point because, as he put it, Cloud is a ""puppet"". He used Cloud's anger and hatred for Sephiroth against him, which climaxed with Cloud giving Sephiroth the Black Materia. None of the other clones could've done that, they were all useless apart from Cloud. Sephiroth tells Cloud he doesn't know who he is to break Cloud. It is a lie, and one which effects Cloud greatly, as Sephiroth knew it would. It puts Cloud right into Sephiroth's hands.

The clones could have done this job perfectly as well. Cloud specifically mentions that they've been following Jenova all along, proven by the fact that we keep battling parts of Jenova and we've already discussed the powers of Jenova. 

&gt; Yes, Sephiroth initially believes ""Jenova"" is his mother simply because someone told him so. He has no idea what or who Jenova is. During his breakdown in Nibelheim and after he's come to terms with this new information, he fully embraces the idea of Jenova being his mother, and accepts his new purpose on that basis. It isn't conjecture, it isn't assumptions, not even a little.

Jenova isn't his mother, never was and never will be. He was misinformed by someone (i.e. Hojo, or Gast). He was told that she died giving birth to him. There's nothing else there. Everything you've just said is conjecture.
On top of that, it contradicts with everything. He accepted his new purpose? So, even though he accepts Jenova as his mother (according to yourself), he now battles Jenova in a battle of wills that never happened in the game. Why fight his own mother?

And yes, the scene outline is fact and it clearly shows that Sephiroth is there for Jenova, that he's doing what she wants him to do. Jenova tried to destroy the planet 2000 years ago and still wants to do just that.

&gt; Okay I honestly cannot believe you asked about Sephiroth being egotistical. Egotistical means:""Believing oneself to be better and more important than others."". This is almost the very definition of Sephiroth - he thinks he's so much better in fact that he wants to be a god over the planet. He views the human inhabitants as little more than parasites. The dialogue above also shows this.

Again, this is conjecture. Throughout the game, we only see Sephiroth a couple of times - in Northern Crater encased in crystal and in the flashbacks. In the flashbacks he only shows this erratic god complex behaviour when he approached Jenova and followed this by burning Nibelheim. Who says this wasn't Jenova? You know, the same Jenova who nearly destroyed the Cetra? The Jenova who can influence people's minds? Sephiroth was cool and calm throughout the entire flashback. He comes in close proximity to Jenova and begins acting strange and violent and you're saying it, basically, came out of nowhere, because he read books in the Nibelheim Mansion. 
Where did it state in the Nibelheim Mansion library that the Ancients where slothful creatures not doing their duty whilst the Cetra where this holy race destined to rule the planet? Or did Sephiroth just make that up? Or, do you think Jenova had influence in this?

&gt; Not fully sure what you are talking about here. The Cetra and the Ancients is the same race. It explains that fully in the game. The Jenova Project wanted to create a Cetra (or Ancient) to lead them to the promised land. They understood Jenova to be one. This is why the injected Sephiroth with her cells, as they thought that if it worked, Sephiroth (with new ""Cetra"" cells), could lead them to this land. At the point you are talking about, in Nibelheim mansion during Sephiroth's breakdown (or whatever you want to call it) he had acquired all of his knowledge about Jenova from Shinra's books. This obviously means his knowledge is based on Shinra's knowledge, and Shinra believed Jenova to be a Cetra, hence why Sephiroth initially understood himself to be one. After Cloud sends him into the Lifestream, Sephiroth ""absorbs"" tons of knowledge within the Lifestream

Sephiroth himself refers to the Ancients as slothful, but Jenova being a Cetra. He does this during his rant in the mansion.
And do you honestly believe that what he rants about was in the books in the ShinRa Mansion? You know, about the Ancients being a slothful race not fulfilling their duty and instead going in hiding?

"c8owo3n","I can't answer your Stalin question, I'm sorry! However, I'm more familiar with North Korea, which not only qualifies as a totalitarian country, but also one that [strenuously attempts to control how the kind of history its citizens learn](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/15lw49/historians_what_do_you_think_the_north_korean/).

The nature of a totalitarian society makes it difficult to guess at how many people believe what the regime tells them; the government tends to dislike public expressions of disagreement, so people are naturally reluctant to engage in it. North Korea is no different and has effectively criminalized the expression of any thought that runs contrary to its interests. Political dissidents, and even people who expressed mild criticism of the regime, were typically sent to concentration camps, and Kim il-Sung had probably had the first of these camps built by the late 1950s or early 1960s. Due to the regime's heavy emphasis on collective responsibility, the offender's family would usually be sent to the camps alongside him/her. This has been a very cruel but effective tactic to stifle malcontents.

To the extent that we can guess based on defector accounts and the information available on what North Koreans are taught -- 

 - **It's necessary to examine North Korea in both its pre-famine and post-famine states.** There's a big difference between the amount of information available within the country before and after the 1994 famine. The number of people who left the country increased dramatically after 1994, and their return to North Korea (or contact with those still inside it) had a huge impact on what the average person knew of the outside world.
 - **Recent defectors estimate that no more than 5-10% of the country is ""true believers"" in the post-famine period.** This is really skirting the edge of what's acceptable for /r/AskHistorians content, however, so I'm just mentioning it in passing. And at best, it's just a guess.
 - **Certain areas in the country (notably the northern provinces) are less loyal than others.** There are both historical and political reasons for this. First, the northern provinces (particularly Hamhung) were often where rabble-rousers were banished during Korea's earlier periods, so the region has a history of political dissent. Second, when Kim instituted the *songbun* system that divided the country's population into 50+ different classes based on political loyalty, people who were perceived to be less loyal were sent away from both Pyongyang and the provinces closer to South Korea. 
 - **Even educated defectors have rarely had access to information the regime doesn't want them to know.** Defectors have asked who actually started the Korean War, have not known that man has landed on the moon, didn't know about the use of the two atomic bombs on Japan during World War II, don't know the real role that Kim il-Sung played in anti-Japanese activities (which was a real one, but far smaller than the regime portrays), and rarely have an accurate grasp of 20th or early 21st century history. Even their sense of Korea's classical and medieval history is often distorted by the regime's desire to emphasize the north and Pyongyang as the most important contributors to Korean culture, so the fact that it was the southern kingdom Silla and Tang dynasty China that unified the peninsula is often glossed over.

So I would say, at least with respect to North Korea, that most people do not have any serious alternative but to believe what they're told because they have no outlet for information apart from state-approved sources. However, when confidence in the regime has decreased due to stressors like the famine or currency reevaluation, people start to grow more skeptical of other things they are told. In the end, we may never truly know exactly how many believe the regime's propaganda, because there is no effective way to evaluate this in a state that punishes non-belief.

This is in contrast to other former Soviet client states like Poland and East Germany, which both had access to Western news sources and products and were notably skeptical about Soviet propaganda.",1362319488,"this has been a very cruel but effective tactic to stifle malcontents.","cruel but effective","cruel","but",FALSE,"very cruel but effective","effective","very",NA,1

I honestly don't know how you could put up with ""can you come quick?"" for as long as you did, that is so hurtful, like she thinks she's doing you a favor by allowing you to have sex with her... eff that.

It's rare that someone enjoys pity sex or duty sex and even harder to enjoy an orgasm if you know the other person is only there in background and not enjoying themselves or you.

"c8eslio","NOTE: This is my longest comment on Reddit thus far. I understand if decide it's too long to read... **tl;dr Mr. Crook is one mean dude.**

Hello Reddit, I'm Alex Greene. Mike Crook actually sent me an email this morning at 9:43EST:

&gt;Hello:
 
&gt;I am an editor for iPhone Alley, and I am writing a story on your app.

&gt;I would like to get a comment as to this question: how do you answer critics who may say that your app went beyond the level of being clever, and it, combined with your self-promotion, rises to the level of arrogance and basically butting in front of fellow applicants?
 
&gt;I am on a deadline, so any insight you could provide for this would be appreciated.

As he should know, I am high school student, so I cannot answer while I am in school, in class. I view this email for the first time at 11AM during a free period. I considered answering, because I have gotten a lot of criticism for my project. But I hadn't received any criticism similar to what he had mentioned, so I asked him where he had seen that sort of criticism of me on the web. He replied that it's part of his article, so I viewed it for the first time. You should note that even though he sent me his question just before publishing the article, his closing statement is ""We reached out to Greene for a comment on this story, but, not surprisingly, an immediate response to the allegations of arrogance was not received."" 

I read through it while my English class was on the subway for a class trip, and I had to reread it to make sure it was real. I was a bit hurt that someone would actually write something that mean about me. I thought that sort of commentary was reserved for pop culture gossip, not for someone trying to get into his favorite school. All of the other negative feedback I've received has had at least some sense too it, but Mr. Crook made points against me that were completely uncalled for. Whether you feel the need to agree with some of what he's said, I am almost certain he tried to make a fool of me to create a buzz and spur popularity for his site. He tweeted to the man who wrote the original Gigaom article about me, telling him to find out ""the real story"", and further examination of his Twitter feed led me to see that he has just relaunched his site (why not put me down to get more views?).

I've decided not to reply to his email- he would most likely just spin my statement into something false and cruel, but I'll share my thoughts here on Reddit. At least if he wants to tear me apart some more, he'll have to take his time to read through this. If he's that dedicated about something like this, then I truly feel bad for him. I'll just pick through some of what he's said. 

&gt;Greene, a plucky, pock-marked 17-year-old from New York City, 


That's cruel to bring my acne into this situation. I have to deal with it enough on my own, but to have to hear it from a grown man, I don't know what to say.

&gt;Although it’s difficult at times to discern whether Greene has a thesaurus–surely such a self-professed genius as he can arrive at a better adjective than “good”–or whether he actually sent in a resume or a college application, it’s not often that news emerges of a college student writing his or her own app just for the application process.


I did not use a thesaurus. I like making apps, so I made an app for Stanford. My goal was not to make it seem highly polished and contrived. I've also never called myself a genius, nor do I think I am one. I'm not really sure what he's trying to say in the rest of this section, but I did submit a college application, that's how you apply to college. I did not submit a resume, though I'm not sure how that supports his point at all. I've also never heard of any other applicant making a mobile application. I've heard of some videos and music videos, and I've even seen a really neat website someone made for an art school, but not an app. I'd genuinely like to see the other examples, it would be interesting to see (not trying to be sarcastic here).



&gt;So far, only the lockstep, heartwarming side of this story has been told, even the proverbial warm fuzzy.  Now for the, you know, other side of the story.
I'd have to disagree. Most of the articles call attention to my thinking outside the box and wish me good luck. Heartwarming, warm, and fuzzy are definitely exaggerations. 



&gt;Ever the self-promoter, Greene wrote a self-serving blog post designed to get Stanford’s attention, as if a custom app weren’t enough


I made an app, made a post to display the app, and then told Stanford about it. By his thought process, I'm supposed to just leave the video on YouTube posted under a channel with 0 popularity and hope that Stanford finds it? I think it would be quite cocky to expect Stanford to come looking for my app. To counter this point, I'd like to mention that I'm actually a YouTube partner; I posted it on my personal channel because it was more relevant to me than my subscribers. Whether you care to believe it or not, I consider myself quite humble. But I'm applying to a college, and I've understand that isn't always the best thing when it comes to colleges, job application, etc. Enough on this topic... moving on.



&gt;Perhaps as an indicator that Greene’s self-initiated fame will be short-lived is the fact that his previous attempts at apps have been described as “lame and pointless” and “a waste of time” by reviewers on the App Store.


Firstly, my goal was not fame. I built the app and then planned on showing Stanford. I posted it to three sites- CollegeConfidential, Reddit, and HackerNews- to see what other people thought about my creation. If my goal was media distribution, I would have submitted it to as many sites as possible, maybe even to iPhoneAlley. I honestly wasn't really sure how to show it Stanford. To my excitement, I found Kevin Tofel's article about my app on Gigaom. Looking back, he most likely found my post on HackerNews. Now to address his criticism of my apps. I never, anywhere, at any time, to anyone, said that any of my apps were amazing, and the best, and that I should be commended for making them while in high school. That said, I think my apps are neat. Some have had more effort put into them than others. Some of them reflect the horrible photoshop skills I had some time ago. Some have tons of downloads per day. Some have none. But I think all of them are neat. I think the projects I'm working on or considering working on at the moment are much cooler than what I've put out already, but I'm not going to do a rush job just so Mr. Crook can post a review on his site. And to address app review in particular, every app has good and bad reviews- even the ones rated 5 stars. He mentioned before how the articles about my app only focused on the good. He's being quite the hypocrite at the moment, because there are many good reviews of my apps as well.



&gt;These days, a chimpanzee smoking a cigarette and wearing lipstick in a science lab could write an iPhone app.

But did that chimp actually make the app?



&gt;However shoddy his programming skills are (and believe me, they are shoddy, and that’s only because I can’t use the other word!) Greene’s methods were, admittedly, genius.

He calls me out for considering myself a genius, and then proceeds to call my methods genius. Also, how would he know about my programming skills?



&gt;However, he is not the only applicant to Stanford.  Some–and he may not grasp this concept–have worked even harder than he has, and they deserve fair consideration.

I can grasp the concept. I'm not saying I'm the best applicant. There are many people who are brighter, quicker, have done a lot more. Does that mean that anyone below them shouldn't be considered? iPhone Alley is not the most popular tech blog. It's not the most popular iPhone app review blog either. It doesn't even have the highest traffic stats. Does that mean we shouldn't consider it a good blog that could be ranked highly amongst iPhone app review blogs? Hey Crook, maybe iPhone Alley needs it's own app, or would it be horrible to expect people to read articles on your site when they can read articles on Engadget or TechCrunch?



&gt;Imagine if, as he shouted that at the top of his lungs, he waved an application in one hand and an iPhone 5 with his app running in the other, with a wild look in his eyes and drool running down his chin.

This is just weird. Also, I have a 4S.



&gt;Perhaps an entitled upbringing which taught, for whatever reason and wrongly, that Greene is better than everyone else is to blame for his arrogant tactics. Who knows?

You have no grounds to criticize my upbringing. Above all else you've said about me, I find this offensive.



&gt;As it stands right now, he’s certainly not Stanford material.  Until he matures, perhaps a lesser institution would be more fitting.

These statements are getting so absurd that I almost want to laugh a little bit.



&gt;[via: Huffington Post]

Now I'm not journalist, so correct me if I'm wrong, but doesn't this mean that the information from the article was pulled from given source? None of what he mentioned, except the fact that I made the app, is from Huffington Post.

Those issues you mentioned are legitimate (though a few of them, especially ""they work themselves to death more frequently"", are a bit vague). The issue of men being raped, abused, threatened, deemed less fit parents, etc: these are real issues that should be addressed.

But a joke in a bathroom at the expense of men with small penises? That's not worthy of a mention. If it is given the same attention as real issues, that cheapens every other complaint and issue that the men's rights movement has. 

If a person breaks their leg and someone says ""Walk it off"" that's insensitive and cruel. But it doesn't mean that saying ""Walk it off"" is never allowed. If someone skins their knee and acts like they have a broken leg, then saying ""Walk it off"" is very appropriate. Calling an ambulance and having them go around in a wheelchair is stupid and just makes the person with the broken leg seem less legitimate.

"c7cs9qh","I grew up in a small town, a population of about 500, our high school probably had 60 students total, many of whom came from either other towns, or farmsteads.  I was with the same group of students from kindergarten to senior year.  First year of high school we get this new kid, who was... eccentric to say the least.  His family were hog farmers, which was a rarity around there, most were cereal farmers.  We figured we'd try to chat him up, see what he was like, asked him what he did for fun.  He said that working with the hogs was the most enjoyable thing for him, particularly assisting them in mating...  Most hog farmers have a dummy with a bag attached to it so that when the boar mounts it and ejaculates in the bag, the farmer will artificially inseminate the sows.  This guy did it the old school way of making the boar mount the sow and with his hand, guide the boar's cock in...  
Had it been from a strictly business standpoint, that might have been ok.. However as he's telling us this, his legs are fidgeting excitedly, he's breathing in short halting breaths, and has the creepiest smile on his face.

Well, like mean highschool kids do, we awarded him the name PigFucker.  This went on for awhile, until alot of us started feeling bad.  Our school was small and he had no friends, our teasing sure didn't help so ww decided to give him another chance. However this kid just kept saying weird disturbing shit like it was normal.  We'd ask him what he did on the weekend, once told us he was ""wrestling his sister"" and that his nuts hurt from her grabbing him there.  No lie, this apparently happened so frequently that he eventually got so damaged he had to have one removed!!

That part is quite sad, and I'm not trying to mock his predicament... But the way he'd describe his ""wrestling"" habits was every bit as fucked up as the hog story.  There are many such examples of this behaviour, but you get the picture.  It got to the point where whenever he'd say ""Hey guess what?!""  We'd groan and say we didn't want to hear it, then he'd go on and tell us anyway.  Many of us(me included) would have enough and out of frustration yell ""Fuck off Pigfucker!!""  

Any kind of group project with him was a nightmare.  ""Hey guys, I got lumps on my scalp.  They're horns...""  Not now dude, come on, lets focus on our work.  ""You know what that means?  I'm horny!  Did I ever tell you parents are second cousins?"". Goddamn it pigfucker, would you shut up?

So this went on throughout all of high school, after graduation I moved to the city to work for a couple of years then started university,  Last year I went back home and while there, attended a community gala night (we call them socials).  I see him there!  And he's having conversations with people so I assumed he had outgrown his weirdness as many people do after high school.  I myself had an emo phase that lasted way too long...

So I decided, as adults, I should go talk to him.  I approached him, asked him how he was doing then said: Hey man, I was kind of mean to you in high school and I just wanted to apologize for that and hope theres no hard feelings.""  He said it was all good.  I should have left it at that.  I asked what he'd been up too.  He proceeded to stare at my for an uncomfortably long time, then began wiggling his nostrils, put his thumbs in the front of his jeans and hop from foot to foot. ""Jig!  I've been doing the jig!!""  I just said take care and walked away.

I don't think he was retarded, I really think he just never socialized properly.  His family kelt their kids pretty isolated from most folks, I knew one of these exceptions that knew the family and confirmed that yes, his parents were second cousins.  I know its rude and cruel, but if ever I'm hanging out with guys I went to school with, all one of us has to say is ""Hey, remember pigfucker?""

I see you're the king of Neverlaid.  This joke of a main profile photo gets the views, but in a bad way.  You're like the People of Walmart for OKCupid.  They're hoping there's more ridiculous photos for their amusement.

Now I know what the gay lovechild of The Joker and Wolverine would look like.  If you want to rock the mutton chops, you have to be badass like Wolverine.  You are about 50 beers past that, so tone up or you disrespect the chops unless you're in a biker gang.

At this point I see a bunch of small photos and some that are obviously old.  Nothing before the giant arm tattoo.  It's obviously dated, makes you look like you did nothing with your life, and also makes them question the authenticity of your current physical situation.

**Summary**

Holy Peter Pan complex, Batman!  You work for the circus, read comics, and play old SNES games people beat before they turned 12.  It's time for a wake up call.  You're 30 years old.  While you may feel young, that age is a stigma that you should have grown the fuck up by now.

**Good At**

What just happened to your shift key?  I'm not sure I just stepped into an incomplete profile.  Go back and add capital letters and grammar and shit to the rest of this profile.

Hopefully your sarcasm isn't cruel, but witty and with appropriate comedic timing.  Otherwise, work on not being a smug prick.

**First Things Noticed**

Why the fuck does a veggie chef smell like bacon?  Explain...

**Favorites**

I hope you're listening to audio books because you're out being active and not being a lazy bastard.

Organize and clean everything up.  Lists are great.  Favorites should be picked up at a glance.  Great conversation starters with the right people.

**6 Things**

 #6:  Counting.  You can't live without counting.

**Thinking About**

This is pretentious douchebaggery here.  One of the great failures of agnostics and atheists is this sort of shit.  Get over yourself.

**Friday Night**

Wow, suddenly so negative.  I know you were joking, but you would need to rephrase it, like ""Wage slave for the greatest show in Australia.""

**Private Thing**

So you get your skid marks right on the old pants.  Nice imagery.

**Looking For**

Thing is, when you're not looking for anything serious you should try to find the Plenty Of Fucking equivalent for Australia.  OKCupid is a slight more serious in most areas.  I'm also not sure how well OKCupid does in Australia as well.

"c75afhi","The Indonesian custom seems to be similar to male circumcision, depending on whether the clitoral hood or the clitoris are cut, and whether any nerve damage results.  

This [article](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/20/magazine/20circumcision-t.html?_r=0) says  

&gt; Siti Rukasitta, who has been a circumciser at the foundation for 20 years, said through an interpreter that they use a small pair of sterilized scissors to cut a piece of the clitoral prepuce about the size of a nail clipping. Population Council observers who visited the event before the 2003 study, however, reported that they also witnessed *some cases* of circumcisers cutting the clitoris itself.

Even if the small but of the tip of clitoris is sometimes cut off, it probably isn't sexually crippling, given that the clitoris as a whole is sensitive.   It's just heinously painful and cruel.  But these people cut their boys, too.

edit: a much better [Population Council Paper (pdf) on Indonesian FGM](http://www.popcouncil.org/pdfs/frontiers/reports/Indonesia_FGM.pdf).

Often, there is no cutting, and it involves just rubbing or scraping, or sometimes a pricking. When there is cutting, the amount removed is most often ""variously described as round, sharp-edged, a grain of rice, a piece of a grain of rice (menir), guava seed, sand, a nail clipping, green bean, and a head of needle, and komedo (black-hat on the nose). ...

"c6z27uy","I have to disagree, only because, as I say in another post saying something similar to you...I don't believe in ""evil"" in our *real* world.  Our real world, our human history, is full of madmen who butcher children or rape and laugh as they cut into other humans; who relish death and destruction.  I think they are madmen.  I think they have a mental illness, or a particularly horrifyingly fucked up past that they didn't or couldn't cope with, or some combination; I don't think any of them are proof of some ""evil"".  I think there is some reason, even if that reason is purely that their mind is ""broken"" in some way, some reason besides ""evil"" that made them like that; no demons inside.  For [ASOS/ADWD](/b ""Roose, it is clear that he is cold and cruel but that it is all calculation.  He doesn't actually enjoy it; he's not evil.  He does things that he does because on his moral scale the lives of others don't really matter and he has the intent of making his house strong.  In his speech to Reek/Theon, he says as much.  He accepts that he is going to die one day and feels, by his own moral compass, that the incentives to act the way he does are worthwhile enough.  He isn't compelled by some force like evil.  Ramsay, being a son of a man as cold and calculating as Roose, and not even a loved son - if Roose CAN love - but disdained, a bastard, clearly had a very screwed up past.  I don't think he's evil, I think he's cruel but it has some cause like mental illness or the fact that he sought acceptance from a father who himself wasn't exactly what WE would call morally good to begin with; his goal was something horrific to us.  His cruelty all seems like him proving he is of noble blood and powerful and not a Snow, that he has control over others and can wield it and it makes him feel strong."")  Again, I agree, I'm not excusing any of their behavior; I'm not saying it's okay or forgivable or I'm cool with it.  I'm talking about the idea of ""here is the GOOD army in white armor, and there is the EVIL armor in black armor; the EVIL army come from Mordor or EVIL-land or whatever.  They have no good intentions.  They are evil for evil's sake.  Their reason?  EVIL!  Their goal?  EVIL!""  I don't think these books (or the real world) have such notions.  Every cruelty, even the ones I don't forgive, the ones that horrify me, the ones we shouldn't excuse, the ones I hope punishment comes for (*heh*), I believe were the result of some incentive, some goal, some process, something real (mental illness and ineptitude/foolishness fit in as real things), and not just ""evil"".  Therefore, the White Walkers cannot be evil as it doesn't exist in the I&amp;F universe.  Sure, their plan might be terrible, morally unacceptable, their goals may be cruel and full of hate, but there is some reason for all of it beyond a pure evil for evil's sake.


As I said in my other post, even Eddard has some darkness to him, that I think manifests in his love of the letter of the law which extends to a sort of mainstream and ""common"" view of others; he has certain prejudices and bigotry that he uses to judge others without looking into them too deeply.  Not that Jaime doesn't deserve some harshness, but I think Ned was a bit too dismissive of him and I see where Jaime comes from when thinking he is pompous.  Ned submitted to the common notion of Varys as an untrustworthy viper at first; prejudices like not trusting the ""lord only in name"" eunuch but being more trustworthy of ""high class"" and ""official"" people like the head of the goldcloaks or somesuch speak to what Dany was told about the man, of him being a cold-hearted ""dog"" of the Usurper.  I'm not saying he was ""bad"", but just like I don't believe in any pure ""EVIL"" I don't believe in any pure ""GOOD"".



I think many wrongs are done in our actual, real world because of people supplanting notions of ""right"" and ""wrong"", which are nuanced, require case-by-case thought and analysis and empathy, with ""good"" and ""evil"", which are simple, and stark, and clearly labeled, and quick, and easy, and definitive.  I think one of the things that Martin infuses into this novel is the notion that so many pre-conceived notions are proved wrong - mistaken history, mistaken prophecy, mistaken allegiances, mistaken catalysts for huge things - as soon as someone looks closer, ignores the story that is told by the victor, gets to know the human reasons, the real motivations behind something.  For all Cersei has done wrong, dark, cruel, arguably ""evil"", you look deep enough and you see that she loves her children (and that she has very nice cheekbones).  Now, *should* she love Joffrey?  Well, I wouldn't.  Should she, despite her love, be better at raising that boy into a proper king?  Yes.  She's foolish and in many ways simple-minded, and cruel and petty, but like every single other character and faction in these books, there is no ""evil"".  Just emotions and reasons and causes and results that we agree with or don't.  That's how I see it, anyway =)

This makes the most sense - EX. a red dragon, they aren't particularly cruel. But they will steal the last bit of value you have because, well, it has value. They care about 2 things - a full belly and a large horde. They don't care if you suffer, so long as they get richer. But they are evil.

A Demon is both greedy and cruel - they revel in causing misery while gaining a wealth of souls to barter with.

A rogue who steals for necessity, can't be blamed for thieving - but one that has choices to make money but steals anyways, without making up for it in some way, is evil.

So you are right, there are ways for a thieving rogue to maintain a neutral standing - there is no way for a selfish good rogue to maintain the good standing.

If we count the pre-born then add in 53 million dead in America alone, and 13 million a year in China. The Vietnam War; the Soviet-Afghan War, gulags, concentration camps, corporatism, collectivism, fascism, racism, apartheid, abortion clinics, and all the rest.  We're destroying ourselves.  These are the works of his hand?  Give me Basil the II and Mt. Athos any day.

You know, Ivan Karamazov said something quite similar in Rebellion and The Grand Inquisitor.  Here's the thing: you can only believe it if you don't believe that you yourself have had any effect on the world, and see yourself too as a passive observer and not an active participant.

Your man, here, doesn't take into account the fact that maybe human desires are disordered not by nature, but as perversion of nature wrought upon the world by evil, which is itself the result of sin.  Perhaps we were never meant to want to taste and touch, but because we chose to do that which we ought not want to do, we started wanting evil and forgot how to want the good.  This is the story of the fall, that we chose to eat something other than God, and so stopped wanting Him.

The story of Christianity is that God is not laughing at us from the sky.  Christ is risen!  Whatever the reason for sin and evil and death, the incarnation, suffering, and death of Christ shows that God plays by His own rules.  Dorothy Sayers put it brilliantly: That God should play the tyrant over man is a dismal story of unrelieved oppression; that man should play the tyrant over man is the usual dreary record of human futility; but that man should play the tyrant over God and find him a better man than himself is an astonishing drama indeed.”  That is the story of Christ.

You can choose, as Ivan Karamazov, to simply reject the story.  Well, then, we have to take a different bent.  If we believe that all that tasting and touching and all that have no effect on the world and others, than yes, God is a tyrant and we are His jesters.  This isn't the case.  If our improper tasting and touching leads to an ill effect on others, or ourselves, then it is indeed bad.  Sin introduces evil into the world, and who can know how far this evil has affected the world?  How do I not know that it was not through my impatience that the man in front of me on the road cut me off?  How do I not know it was through some long-forgotten bit of idle talk that the person who has slandered me learned to slander?  The application of chaos theory to this simple concept, that sin introduces evil into the world, means that when you sin, you corrupt not only yourself but all of creation with you.  I cannot say of any evil I see or hear, ""I was not the cause of this.""

I'm beginning to repeat myself a bit here, but this is why I keep bringing up empathy. (Simplifying things by ignoring morality, innocence, etc) everyone should get to enjoy living a long, happy and fulfilling life. That's why shrugging someone's death off as a mere statistic frustrates me. 

I know you said in your second paragraph that you'd still be upset that the bear was killed, but this was never the argument. The argument was about justifying whether or not the animals life was of more significance than the girls. 

Taking a different approach for a moment. Let's say that hypothetically a man walking through the woods accidentally wandered into a pack of wolves territory and they killed him not for food, but because they saw him as a threat. Many people here would say ""that's just animals trying to protect themselves"". Funny thing is that we're also animals. Social creatures that can also get very territorial and protective of our own.

Understanding her illness has made it so much easier to be compassionate and to talk to her like she's a human being rather than this tyrannical force that was always changing directions.  Now I have actually been able to *help* her work through some of her more negative behaviors, using techniques a DBT therapist taught me (she refuses in very stark terms to see any mental health professionals because in spite of being told by more than one that she meets ALL the DSM-IV criteria for BPD, she will not believe it and thinks it's just something we want to believe so we can hate her for it).

One day, we decided it would be awesome to have a rock fight, so a bunch of neighborhood kids met up there and split into teams and started throwing rocks at each other, though we were kind of pretending, so nobody was actually *trying* to hit anyone.

Until, inevitably, one came sailing through the air and struck me directly on the eyebrow.  I was instantly blinded by blood and pain, and screamed out, ""YOU FUCKER!""

You aren't just rejecting a simple idea about god, or religion, rather your entire understanding and perception of the universe, and your relationship to it, is shifting.  It can be a very disconcerting and uncomfortable feeling.

I think some people have a hard time appreciating how difficult it can be to lose faith. We see a lot of posts on r/atheism from people who feel great relief and freedom when they reject their faith, but less from people who feel the loss and grief that can come with losing an entire worldview and the social circles that are a part of this view.  It is a life changing event. For many people, the experience of losing faith is not easy and straightforward. It can be a very confusing and isolating time and it is very common for people to feel depressed and anxious while they are going through it.  Here is a good page discussing this transition. http://psychcentral.com/lib/2007/the-pain-of-losing-your-faith/

I know that my own journey from faith to atheism was long, and at times very hard.  I also struggled to find meaning, and the world often felt hard, lonely, and cruel. But the more I have learned about life and the universe, the more I have been transfixed by the wonder and beauty I have found.  Learning more about evolution on has also been uplifting.  It absolutely blows my mind to think that every living organism on this planet is part of an unbroken chain of life that extends 3.6 billion years into the past. Everyone of us is part of this chain, and to me, to keep this chain going and growing is a pretty amazing goal in itself.

There have been a lot of really good posts on this page discussing the meaning and purpose that we can find in the absence of a god, and people have put it much more eloquently than I could, so I’ll just mention that it was really helpful for me to realize that that just because existence doesn't have the meaning or purpose that I thought it had, doesn't mean that it doesn't have any meaning or purpose at all.

-Suicide is not the answer. Suicide is for pussies. For weak little boys who can't grit their teeth, stand up strong and tall, and do what ever it takes to accomplish their goals like a MAN. Life is a BITCH, and it is HARD. But giving up is not the answer. This is when your life is going to change dramatically, but the direction it goes is going to depend on how you decide to handle your business.

I would of course judge danger to myself before deciding (or at least I would hope I would) but if I could intercede and help, I would. I would not if it was 2 guys going at each other because how would I know who to help? If it was a woman going at a man, and she was clearly the aggressor, I would feel extremely obligated because of the unfair position it puts men in. If he does anything to stop her, ABUSE! I would step in and tell the bitch to back up and cool off. I would do this because I know that the consequences of my actions would be less severe than the consequences if the man acts. And if she attacks me, I can defend myself without being unfairly labelled the bad guy. 
There are situations where I feel it is more appropriate for women to handle women and men to handle men. For example, my husband and I went to a BBQ at my brothers. He was driving us home and got a call to pick up his very drunk brother in law and his very drunk girlfriend. I had never met either of these people. But, one of us had to sit in the. back with them. 
It was because it was my brother, therefore my husband would not be in his situation if not for me, and there was a very drunk woman stranger. I sat in the back beside the woman. If it had been his friends brother in law and girl, my husband would have say in the back next to the man. 
If a woman steps in to confront a man in defense of someone, there is a chance he could hurt her. Not because men are violent and cruel, but because he is likely bigger and stronger than her. If the chick outweighs him, that's different. But something like a shove, a hit, something that wouldn't affect a guy the same size as much can do more damage to a smaller person male or female. So yes, I think if there is an option, if there is a man of equal size that could possibly diffuse the situation, I would hope that he would, to lessen the chance that someone would get hurt. If it was a man being attacked by a woman, I would expect a woman to step in because any man who helps risks getting unfairly labelled and targeted.

But I apologize for intruding on your place to vent. As I said, it was just the implied ideal that women should take care of women because I have no obligation to, that really concerned me.

A parent should be willing to sacrifice themselves for their children.  Sacrifice obligation ends there. 
Humans are social, pack animals. We need each other. Don't let sexism and extremists end that, because no one would survive on their own.

Don't let's pretend that you are being open minded because you aren't. You like what you see in them insofar as it is a reflection of your values, not the values of their faith.

You are going to have to take charge of your situation.  It sounds daunting and cruel, but you're going to have to pull yourself up by your own bootstraps, so to speak. 

Here are, however, a few things that might help:

1.  Make yourself do something.  Even when - no, especially when - you're too depressed to leave the house.  Call some friends, cash in some favors.  Go to the movies, go golfing, go to a bar, go work out at the gym, watch a TV series you've always wanted to watch, read a book, learn to play guitar like you've always wanted.  Physically make yourself do it.

2.  When it feels like too big of a deal, find someone to talk to.  If you feel comfortable with any family or friends, great.  You may find it easier to chat with a female friend about this.  If not, let it all out on the Internet, man.  That's what it's there for.  It's also probably okay to entertain some vengeful fantasies about her being alone forever while you find someone who likes you because you're a good guy (in the short term.)

3.  Remember: some people are just lousy people.  Some people are okay people who do lousy things.  There's nothing wrong with you because you were fooled; you were the good guy looking for the right thing.  It's going to be difficult to trust again, but you're going to have to at some point if you want to move on past this.  When you've put some time and distance between you and this situation, you can start to reflect on the warning signs.  You'll find that there were either issues in your relationship or issues with her that could have let you figure this out earlier.  

4.  Try to forgive the onlookers who didn't say anything.  They were cowards, but try and think more that they were put in a really awful situation and not that they were intentionally trying to hide it from you.

Best of luck.  3.5 years is a long time, and it's going to suck getting over it.  You will, however, be fine.

"c63erm2","This sure is a throwaway.

A long time ago, there was a girl I fell terribly in love with. Everything about our relationship seemed burnished with gold, at first - we were boundlessly passionate with each other, we shared the same hopes for the future, many of the same values. I was utterly bowled over by her.

But neither of us were in a very mature emotional state at the time - not that we were especially young, just that neither of us had processed some pretty big traumas from our past. She was afraid of strong emotions, and sabotaged our relationship by pursuing someone from her past who didn't care about her. Her pattern was (and mostly still is) to feel safest with people who didn't care much about her, or about whom she didn't much care herself. No risk of getting hurt if you have nothing invested. For her it was easiest to have a relationship that had all the external trappings of solidity, but no risk of a challenge to her emotional distance. So her very handsome ex who didn't care for her was much more appealing than quirky me, who loved her fiercely.

My damage was no less painful - the hot-and-cold of her alternating advances and retreats pushed every button I had. I desperately needed - fuck, NEED - for her to have that Hollywood ending where she realizes the right guy for her has been under her nose all along. Which would make of my loyalty and hopeless love something noble, and worthwhile. Instead of being a sad sap who loved someone who treated me abominably, I'd be a romantic hero, who gets the girl in the end.

For quite a while she would break up with me, and then soon after call me and tell me she regretted it, that she wanted to be together. She'd make plans for us to see each other, but before she could actually show up, she'd have changed her mind again, and be off pursuing her ex. It was agony, but I couldn't say no. The first couple of times she did this, yes, she was being heartless and cruel. But after that? I was letting her behave this way, in the hope that this - THIS TIME - she'd finally mean it, and we'd get end up together.

We didn't. Eventually, and after intervening relationships on both our parts, I'd got myself a steady girl who I was pretty crazy about, and the two of us were going to move to  California for a fresh start on life. Just before I was set to move, TOTGA (The One That Got Away) wrote a long and passionate letter, begging me to come spend a night with her, to see if maybe things with her would be better, and I should not move away, and give her a chance.

Like a fool, I did. Though - and really, I should have seen this coming, and you probably just did - when I showed up she told me she'd changed her mind, and didn't want to do it. So there you go, I'd betrayed my girlfriend at the time, and for nothing. 

I moved to California. For unrelated reasons, the relationship with the girlfriend didn't work out. Years passed. A couple of time TOTGA came out to visit me, and we had wonderful, romantic, passionate weekends together. We kept in touch sporadically. I still wanted to get back together. She married some other guy she didn't love - not even the ex she'd cheated on me with. Just some guy who was safe, who didn't poke too deep, and make her feel very strongly about anything. Low risk. I tried to move on.

I mean, at this point something like 7 years has gone by. I realize intellectually that she is just poison, that she's betrayed me over and over again, that she's never going to behave differently, and even if she did, it doesn't magically make better 7 years of messing with my head and heart. But knowing that in my mind wasn't the same as feeling it in my heart, and still, I loved her, and couldn't forget her.

But she wouldn't give it a chance, even after she divorced the safe guy. So i tried to move on, I really did. I met a girl, and she was just the opposite, she needed me, she loved me, she wanted to start a life together. And I did love her, do love her - genuinely - but never with the same bottomless passion I'd felt with TOTGA. 

Should I have broken it off with this one, and lived the rest of my life single and alone, because there was someone I loved, who didn't love me in return? That seemed a cruel stroke, too cruel a fate to endure. So we got married. It was a wonderful wedding, and our friends and families were delighted. We shared hopes for the future, hobbies, values, interests - on paper, we're a great match. But the romance in our relationship cooled even before the wedding, and more after.

But still TOTGA haunts me. She writes from time to time (or foolish me will write to her) and tells me she regrets that she married again. She has a child now, and wants another, and she tells me she wishes it were with me - which I also wish.

But when it comes down to it, she will not make any changes in her life. She says she doesn't really love her husband, but it's comfortable. She says she thinks all the time about me, that I'm to her the one that got away. To which I say - Ok, let's do it, let's be together! At last!

But nothing changes. Her promises are as empty as ever. Does she actually mean it, when those rare occasions move her to tell me she loves me? Or am I now, as I've always been, just a nice, safe fantasy to indulge in, a sort of emotional backup plan, in case the first choice doesn't work out. Actually I'm pretty sure that even if she did divorce her husband, she'd pick some other guy before giving us a chance.

I'm pretty sure I will always be last in  her priorities, but a convenient lift when she wants to feel desired. 

And yet.

And yet if she turned up on my doorstep (and I know in my bones she never will, but IF...) then I am a damaged enough human being that despite the lies, the cheating, the abandonment, the emotional abuse - despite all that. I'd still run away with her.

What once felt like a fairy tale romance turned into a farcical romantic comedy, and has now just become a tragedy that's yet to have its tear-filled ending. 

I recognize my own agency in this. I know that how I feel is appallingly stupid. There's nothing unkind you can say to me that I haven't already said to myself, a thousand times, over a thousand sleepless nights staring at the ceiling and wishing. 

But I still a throw a coin in every fountain, and wish for her. I still wish for her every time I see a shooting star. I am still hooked, 12 years on.

"c61qtbp","I thought I had adressed those points, but I can see that I wrote that in another topic.

Yes, if god wrote the rules for creation then it could stand that he didn't hurt people, he simply allowed nature to take it's course.

A very good argument against that is this: He did it knowing what would happen. As others have stated, and I shall inform you now, God created the propensity for evil, pain, disease, etc, with the full knowledge of the future.

When I went through my Christian education, as you probably were also taught, God is an Omniscient, Omnipotent, All Good, All Merciful and All Just deity. I will not get into how Mercy and Justice cannot co-exist, and is therefore a foundational fallacy, but I can if you'd like.

So God is all knowing, all powerful, all good, all just, etc. This means, as I was taught, that in the Beginning God knew everything that was, is, and will be. He knows our every thought, our every action, our past's, present and futures. He knew all of this before time and he knows all of it know, and will always know it.

This means that when God created the world and the universe, he knew how things would turn out. He knew that when he created the Earth he would also create life. He knew that when he created life, he would create man, and when he created man he knew the intimate details of every life that would ever occur on Earth, including every human life.

This means that when God first created Adam and Eve, he knew they would fall to temptation. He knew that when Satan talked to them they would give in to the temptation. So what did God do with this knowledge? Did god, because he is All Powerful, change the future? Did God, because he is All Powerful remove Satan from creation, or create humanity with greater fortitude to resist the temptation? Did God remove the possibility of temptation from the Garden, or Earth?

No, God created Adam and Eve, allowed Satan into the Garden, and then created the Tree from which they could fall. He said everything else in the world, the universe, all of creation was acceptable except eating from the Tree. Those are not the literal words, but they are the intention. They could eat from anything, go where they please, live their lives in peace and communion with him, but they couldn't eat from one Tree, just one. That tree would give them the knowledge of morality, about what is right and wrong and why.

God created humans with the ability to be tempted, and therefore fall, and then created the way in which they would fall. During that entire time, even before Satan, Adam, Eve or anything was created he knew what would happen. He created the fall and caused it to happen. He could've stopped it at any moment, like a loving being would do, but he chose not to. This is fine, they made their choice, but why is God evil as a result of this? I would love to tell you.

So, God created for 6 days and on the 7th day he rested. There is no later creation, everything was already made and the Bible never again mentions God creating anything new, he simply uses what's already present. For example, he could bind atoms and molecules together with his will to make something from ""thin air"". So everything was already created before the Fall. This includes Viruses, Diseases, Animal Instincts, etc.

Lions already had sharp teeth, snakes already had poison, the Black Plague bacteria was already living on fleas. Spiders already had venom, sharks already had teeth and were built to kill, genetic diseases were already encoded within our genome which we would inherit from Adam and Eve. Further, nature already had the capability to create hurricanes, erupt volcanoes, originate earthquakes. The processes that brought about avalanches, mud slides, tsunami's, solar flares, supernovas, sink holes, rip tides, etc, were already put in place.

God created the world knowing the Fall would happen and instead of trying to lessen the blow so that humans would only age and die, he created a world with a gigantic propensity to kill humanity. If you really think about it, humans are practically defenseless compared to everything else. We're not overly fast, we're not very strong, our senses aren't the best in anything, etc. We're just the most intelligent thing around and we have thumbs. Our only defense is that we can try to make defenses.

So, God created us knowing we would fall. He then created the means by which we would fall, set up the only way we could fall, and then let us fall. Further, he created a place for all ""non-believers"", which the majority of all humans would be, to go and burn for eternity. Then, once  Hell and Sin had been dealt with, he created very interesting, painful, horrific and disgusting ways for humans to be tortured, humiliated and killed.

That does not sound like a loving God to me. That sounds like a sadistic child who sets up an impossible to win game and then blames the loser when it happens. That's like telling a human to breathe while naked in Space, then hurling them into the sun to burn eternally when they can't. He made it so we couldn't, then burns us for it.

To further clarify, He created Hell. Everything in and out of the Universe was created by God, therefore he had to create Hell or at least the functions by which it originated knowing that Hell would be the result. He then knew that the vast majority of human life would not recognize him as God.

For the first X-Thousand years before Christ, God only revealed himself to the Israelites. So even if a person did recognize that there was a god, before Jesus he was going to hell no matter what. An allowance is made for the Israelites who lived before Jesus. Then, after Jesus lived and died, God knew even more people would go to hell because of how poor the communication systems would be. Further, he knew that other areas would create equally convincing and competing religions.

God created us knowing we would fall. He also created the means by which we would fall, and then allowed it to happen. He created a ton of processes and organisms that would kill humanity in the most horrific, terrifying, mind breaking and painful ways possible. He created humans to be very fragile things which could be killed by merely a piece of bread in the throat, let alone a shark, a tsunami, or AIDs. Finally, he created a place of eternal torture which everyone who didn't believe in him as a deity and Jesus as his son would go. He then made sure that believing in him wasn't the obvious choice and made it very hard mind that seeks logic, which he created in us, to accept.

God is not good, loving, just or kind.
God is the original psychopath.
God is playing the most sadistic game one can possibly play, and we are his victims.

You can either choose to follow a sadistic, mass murderer, or you can do what I do and realize he was thought up by a bunch of illiterate, backwards, fearful men a long time ago who were afraid of the gigantic world around them.

They were afraid of all the pain, sickness, and apparent random cruelty of the world, so they created a God. They created a being who was sadistic and cruel, but could be appeased to save them from the torment.

&gt;Lets leave behind the fact that my worldview actually has a place for these kinds of objective moral obligations, and materialistic, atheistic worldviews do not.

I am holding him to a subjective human morality - or to his own standards-you pick. And actually your morality is subjective also-whether you realize it or not. I acknowledge there is no absolute morality without god. But this argument presumes his existence.

That is His prerogative as Creator. I don't see how it is that he would owe us anything.

Do parents owe their children anything? This is the desperation of your point. You cannot reasonably argue that god is good, so now you argue that he doesn't need to be good.

Without going into detail on each position, the best advice I can give you is effort effort effort! Youre still young, they hardly expect you to have fundamentals set by now. What coaches want to see in incoming freshman is any semblance of coordination and athleticism, but more importantly, someone who cares a whole lot about volleyball. If you manage to show the coaches that you want to work your ass off to improve, you'll make a team.

About the injuries, theres a few ways I can go with this talk. My main point would be, youre really young. Im 21, and when someone asks me what kind of injuries I have, I usually say none. In truth, Ive broken most of my fingers, my wrist, I have small tears in muscles and tendons in my right knee and hip, and have some problems with my back, related to my size. I work out almost every day, and keep myself in competitive shape year around to keep playing volleyball. The day I fall out of shape, my body will start falling apart and I will never play again. I still have aches and pains related to tons of problems, sometimes during play sometimes after. Even for how old I am, which most people consider very young to start falling apart, I have new bruises and nicks and soreness almost every time I play. Volleyball is a grueling sport and it takes a toll on your body.

I guess what Im trying to say is, stay in shape, take care of yourself, know when something is bad enough to see a speciallist, and stop yer belly ache-in youngin!

"c5sx8hn","I know I'll be downvoted, but it this needs a REAL critique, and it has to be said:

This comic is unfunny, clunky, and cliche ridden.  As of this post, there are 2400 views but only 14 favorites.  That's an atrocious ratio, and should really be telling you something.

Nerd-parodying webcomics are a literal dime a dozen online.  You have hundreds of competitors.  You make a 'joke' here that's been done hundreds of times using stock stereotype characters we've seen in thousands of iterations.  Seriously, if you can't come up with something new and interesting, you might as well quit now because this comic will go nowhere fast.

The gag itself falls flat because you take way too many panels to set it up.  You spend about 2/3 of the strip (5 out of 9 panels) beating up/belittling the nerdy character for no reason that serves your 'punchline.'  That's forgivable in a story-based comic but this was obviously meant to be a one-off gag.  You should have been able to set that up in 2-3 panels at most.

Also, the strip is too hostile in tone.  Most successful works parodying nerd culture, from Penny Arcade to The Colbert Report. can at times be very incisive and even cruel, but ultimately there is at least an undertone of affection for the material/nerds themselves.  I detect none of that here.  You seem to expect us to have sympathy for the cruel jock, but that was expended completely by having him spend so much of the strip beating up the nerdy guy and reveling in it.",1344945437,"most successful works parodying nerd culture, from penny arcade to the colbert report. can at times be very incisive and even cruel, but ultimately there is at least an undertone of affection for the material/nerds themselves.","cruel, but ultimately","cruel","but",TRUE,"very incisive and even cruel","incisive","even","very",0

"c5l2jku","Meat which has been raised for slaughter was done with the intention of feeding people. To ban that meat (pigs, cows, etc.) would be telling people to starve. In the case of those animals, human lives were deemed more important. In the case of the vegetarian, they may think it cruel, but it would also be cruel to starve the meat eater. The choice to not eat meat doesn't mean that vegetarians have to suffer from watching other people eat it. No one is forcing them to watch. Just like no one is forcing someone to starve by being denied meat.

People that have pigs as pets fall into the same category as vegetarians. They may think it cruel, but human life matters more, and eating pig prevents starvation for a lot of people, because it is an animal of slaughter.

Now, we live in a society which is fortunate enough that we can choose which animals are pets (due to emotional attachment, upbringing, and empathy) and which animals are necessary for humans not to starve (animals of slaughter, or animal products (milk and eggs)). If we lived in a nuclear fallout and had to eat dog to survive, we would, but we don't. Our civilization is lucky enough to be able to form emotional bonds with our pets, and protect those pets from abuse, culinary or otherwise. 


In your hypothetical, you're right, I don't have to watch you eat it. But we live in a society that believes it to be a cruel and inhumane act. It's a benefit of being part of a civilization. We don't have to stand by and watch something suffer, unless that suffering is putting food on millions of peoples plates so they don't starve.

This may shock you but I harbor no primal urges for blood lust in the context of this man's death.

So much hatred, so much... Hatred for people they don't even know, hatred for a man who may have aligned himself with their views. Hatred that extends to the family of a man they don't know. So much blind hatred - and this hatred is being passed off as something good.

"c5im9gz","I am sick to death of reading shit like this. If you believe that it is so easy to improve the situation of native Australians, perhaps you should put forth some ideas?

I am not disagreeing with your statements:
&gt;our native Australians are some of the poorest, unhealthy, poorly treated, politically and socially isolated of any nation any where on earth

HOWEVER our native Australians are also probably the least involved with mainstream society than any other indigenous population in a first world country.  They may unhealthy and their life expectancy is significantly lower than the average, however significantly more money is spent per capita on native Australians the rest.  Unfortunately indigenous Australians choose to live in remote communities far away from out capital cities.  The cost of delivering health care to remote communities is significantly higher.  A large detractor from the average life expectancy is the infant mortality rate which, obviously, is higher because they are further away from our tertiary referral hospitals so getting them to better facilities in a timely manner is very difficult.

Is it so hard to believe that they are so politically and socially isolated when they choose to not participate in mainstream society? In a post in another thread you talked about how the French, Italians and Germans invaded the English over and over, forcing them to adopt their languages and customs.  When the English came to Australia, invaded if you want to call it that, they brought their own society with them, and they expected the natives to fall into line, just like every other conqueror in history.

People talk about the Stolen Generation like it was the worst crime imaginable.  Don't misunderstand, It was a fairly horrible thing to do, both to parents and child, but it was not done with malice. It was wrong and cruel, but not deliberately so. It can also be very easily argued that our most successful indigenous Australians are / were the product of the stolen generation.

(NB - probably the most controversial point I want to make)
Whilst the average life expectancy of an Aboriginal Australian is lower than the average, it is significantly higher than it would have been if no one had ever come to Australia.  It has been said that the indigenous population of Australia would never have improved technologically because before white settlement there were no plants that could be farmed effectively.  This forced the native Australians to remain as hunters and gatherers - thereby no agrarian society could develop.


As for the infamous ""boat people"" I think you will find that most Australians do not have a problem with refugees wanting to come to Australia.  What they do have a problem with is people who circumvent the established systems and ""queue jump"".  Australia is neither the best nor the worst when it comes to refugees.  Out of 32 advanced economies Australia is 18th in refugees per capita and 13th in refugees compared to GDP. [(source)](http://www.asrc.org.au/media/documents/how-we-compare-internationally_.pdf)

Anyway I think that painting us all as racist is strange.  Me, I'm white.  But I went to a school that was only 70% Caucasian, I did a course at uni in which I was very much the minority in terms of race (about 20% Caucasian I would say) and I never have, and never will, look at my friends, colleagues, acquaintances  or strangers and think that I am superior because I am white.

"c5ib92q","James Cartwright (alternate present/slight future)

James has long been a food aficionado, causing him to grow quite fat at a young age, and as a consequence he was bullied during his younger years. In addition to food, James focused heavily on staying clean, and was similarly teased for his adverse reaction to even minor disorder in areas under his control.

As he entered middle school, James was determined to stop being the ""fat kid,"" and for a summer focused on getting his weight down and becoming healthier. He didn't completely abandon his love of food, but he managed to restrain it. This kept him from regaining his previous overweight frame, but he became fairly stressed from the constant need for self-control.

James became a comparatively respectable figure in the next few years, and when he was fourteen, the government announced that they would be carrying out an experiment. This experiment entailed populating a small town with children and teenagers to see how well it could operate without adult intervention. The children were drawn from James' town, and James found himself thrust into the position of mayor.

James' sudden power corrupted almost instantaneously, as he finally had an outlet to unleash his pent-up frustration from years of being bullied or carefully managed eating. He demanded nigh-impossible cleanliness from the residents of his experimental town, ordered gourmet feasts for himself from the citizens' money, and forced his former tormentors into various brawls against each other.

Occasionally officials come to check in on the town, at which James gives his personality an almost complete 180. He acts quiet and meek, listens to what the officials instruct him to do, and gives bland and fraudulent reports on happenings in the town. Around higher powers, James acts like a fairly polite, passive leader who may be a bit of a clean freak; although James is always careful not to let any officials see his ""happy"" villagers.

The only person James trusts is his equally corrupt chief of police, a once-nerd who has become manipulative and vengeful with his power. James is eager to prove his kinship with this figure, and he tries to win the police chief over by doing entirely what he says.

People close to James know that a rebellion is sure to be soon, and James' empire will crumble, but they fear to tell him; overactive hormones have left James emotionally unstable, and anything has the potential to set him off. Similarly, they do not even consider telling him that he is a puppet of the police chief, for fear of a similar reaction from both James and an outraged chief.

"c5fr7pz","The original issue was grossly misinterpreted. This is an issue of *superstition*, yet it was presented as an issue of *exploitation*. There is a very important difference here. Superstition in this case involves unnecessary exploitation, hence why the exploitation appears particularly cruel. Unnecessary violence is always cruel, but there is a huge difference between the unnecessarily cruel and barbaric treatment of bears based on *superstition*, and factory farming based on *need*. 

I won't even care to discuss this with people who fail to grasp the fundamental difference I'm talking about. [Ursodiol](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ursodiol), the active ingredient of bear's bile, can be synthesized artificially, yet because of customer superstition, it is still extracted from live animals. This is cruel and unnecessary. When we are able to produce chicken meat and beef equivalents using synthetic chemistry at same cost or lower, then factory farming will also become cruel and unnecessary. Until then, it isn't. *I very strongly believe humans have a full right to rationally exploit animals*. No, I don't believe that animals can ""deserve"" a happy and fulfilling life in any way just because they exist. Their existence does not justify our stupidity.

There is no way humans can go back to days before 1950s factory farming unless they experience an unwarranted reduction in lifestyle quality. An economic move involving a reduction in lifestyle quality is generally a stupid thing to do. The bear bile customers, on the other hand, *would not* experience a reduction of lifestyle quality if they switched to synthetic bile.

I wish animals well, but I *won't* sacrifice my lifestyle to them, just like I refuse to slaughter goats under full moon to give sacrifice to some ancient god with horns, and I will *never* ask anyone else to sacrifice their lifestyle for that purpose either. Moreover, I consider demanding from rational people to sacrifice their lifestyle in order to save an animal that does not deserve to be saved an immoral thing to do.

By failing to understand that rationally exploiting animals is a perfectly human and normal thing to do, today's environmentalists fail to appreciate the glory of mankind, which from the very beginning depended on domesticating horses, raising sheep and cattle, fishing, domesticating dogs and cats, etc. In other words, by disrespecting farmers, modern environmentalists fail to respect their own ancestors, who in many ways were much better and worthy people than them.",1342620060,"unnecessary violence is always cruel, but there is a huge difference between the unnecessarily cruel and barbaric treatment of bears based on *superstition*, and factory farming based on *need*.","cruel, but there","cruel","but",TRUE,"unnecessarily cruel and barbaric","barbaric","unnecessarily",NA,1

"c5d9elg","I think the biggest problem about answering this is, what condition are the people in? The lyrics leave an extremely vague scenario for us, which lets our imaginations take over the rest....which is the point no? So lets answer some questions

Do you take the world as it is and take away countries/possessions? Or is this imagine if everyone was born into this way.

Are people changed to like the world without countries/possessions? Are you changing their intrinsic values/beliefs? Or will people act as they do now?

I am going to go with the fact that we take countries and possessions away from the world as it is, and people act as they do now, because he says he is a dreamer, and is giving a message about changing the world. 

Now, in the scenario I chose, there is still a question to be answered. Did the changes (no countries, etc.) come from the people changing it? Or are we imagining that they disappear overnight.  Again, since he is talking about changing the world, lets pretend our generation, or the next, is full of enough people able to do this, that we actually some how managed to solve all short term problems and crises, and we exist as an entity, not in divided countries. 

I think long term peace is impossible. There are quite a few things that could happen, but my guess would first be the whole world is forced to solve things diplomatically and calmly. This leaves many crises unsolvable, many compromises non pleasing to either party, and many wars that *need* to break out, but cant. So either, peace dissappears, wars everywhere, or peace stays, crises everywhere.

What are these crises I speak of? There's millions that get fought with violence every day. Lets make an example village in mid Africa called Harmony. In Harmony, there are scarce resources. There is enough fresh water for 100 people to live off of. There are enough houses to shelter even fewer. 

How do you decide who gets the water when there are 1000? A compromise leads to everyone dieing. No one can force there way to the water in this scenario, so what happens? The scenario breaks. People are going to fight for their right to survive whether you want them to or not. This world cannot support a large number of people physically, and without violence how could people survive at all? Violence ensures survival of the fittest, if you will. Cruel, but necessary to live in an impoverished village. Harmony will crumble.

"c5d3khe","In case people want it to be spelled out, this kind of misogyny was commonplace in the medieval world and even the *modern* world. This is maybe the second generation of people anywhere on the planet that does not find virginity in women attractive.

For example, in India, many marriages are still arranged -- in the sense that the parents feel they have a responsibility to find a spouse that their child will be happy with. This gives rise to a ""marriage market"" of sorts, where women are primarily valued for their looks, and men for their accomplishments (and money.) Virginity is much more important for women. And there was never a period of Indian history where that was not true.

Feminists have been talking about the slut/stud double standard for *decades* now, of course, and it's still widely pervasive in the western world. For all the comments saying they would prefer whores to virgins, Americans are still quick to call women sluts/whores if they have sex with ""too many"" people.

"c5auay5","&gt; If the point is to have more money spent on food, to send the signal to producers and suppliers that they must create more of it in general, then why not increase the other variable in this equation and have the rest. owner pay more per unit food but buy less of it? He can offset his cost by charging more of the rest. customers?

If the owner increased the price of the food, then more money will be moved away from the rich that eat at these restaurants. The owner will spend the increased earning towards more food supply or whatever else he needs. This creates jobs and moves the money around markets. Ultimately, a lot of it will end up going towards the poor. 

&gt; 1) India doesn't need a greater SUM of food (as might be created by, amongst other means genetically modified organisms, other tech, devoting more land to farming). Why do we need a greater industrialization of food production to produce more food when there is already more than enough food in the world and india to feed the people of both, respectively.

Let's imagine that you hold 3% (random number) stock of some company. When the company stock increases in price, you receive only a 3% increase of profits. Yes, it is tiny compared to the total increase but the point is that you still receive benefit. The people in poverty hold this hypothetical 3%. The food going to waste is a damn shame but still a necessity if it stimulates the market unless government throws out some laws to shift the waste to the poor somehow. Very unlikely considering the caste system.

&gt; Industrialization is making food cheaper and (some would say worse) and still it does not get to them.

It does get to them. The benefits might be hidden to you but still there. Without industrialization, their situation would be even worse than it is today.

&gt;2) I would not underestimate the negative psychological impact of being hungry and seeing wealthy people toss food out. It's extremely cruel and unjust.

Being cruel is objective. For example, when the United States bailed out the banks. Small business owners will consider this cruel but modern day economists say this [saved the American economy from a huge depression.](http://hpronline.org/arusa/the-bank-bailout-in-perspective/)

""In the broadest sense, TARP was a success. It halted the collapse of the US banking system and may have prevented a second Great Depression. The Congressional Oversight Panel wrote in its final report that TARP provided critical support to markets at a moment of profound uncertainty... TARP also prevented an even deeper recession. A study done by Zandi and Alan Blinder of Princeton determined that without TARP and the Federal Reserve’s monetary easing, GDP growth would have been 4.7 percentage points lower and unemployment would have been 4.0 percentage points higher in 2010.""",1341703784,"it's extremely cruel and unjust.","cruel and unjust","cruel",NA,FALSE,"extremely cruel and unjust","unjust","extremely",NA,1

Look at it this way: You've been given a perspective few women get to see. You put yourself out there, then got rejected in a spectacularly vicious way. Remember this moment the next time your super hot friend wants to do this to someone, or some guy hits on one of you and you feel like cockblocking him. As guys, we're *expected* to put ourselves out there just like you did, and we have the same feelings you do. I see girls do shit like this, and worse, to guys all the time. 

Okay, now I'm going to give you some tough love. I'll tell you what you did wrong, and what you can do differently. If you don't want advice, just stop reading now. 

First of all, imagine this happening from his perspective. I'm NOT justifying his actions, just trying to give insight into them. Imagine you're a super hot girl who gets hit on all the time, and some guy who is between kinda-okay and very heavy (whatever you think you are) makes a move in front of your friends. If you're immature enough to worry about your image, you might even feel embarrassed or insulted. Hopefully you wouldn't be cruel, but many people lash out when they're embarrassed. 

Here's what you did wrong (and yeah, these were all mistakes on your part):

1. You bought him the drink from way across the bar. That means his only impression of you comes from your looks, which for you are (let's be blunt) a liability. He has no chance to be attracted to anything else about you. 
2. You didn't gauge his interest beforehand. Lots of guys like bigger girls, but those guys are the minority. Your mission is to find those guys. 
3. You were too forward. That works GREAT for girls who are 7s or 8s, but if there's no physical attraction and you come on like you're hunting him, you're gonna have a bad time. 
4. You did it in front of his friends. That ups the stakes. He might worry that his equally-douchey bros will rip on him unless he does something hurtful to impress them. It's bullshit, but it happens. 

How you can be successful next time:

1. Being forward won't work for you, so go indirect. Position yourself near the guy, make friendly conversation with him, treat him like you're both squarely in the friend zone. If he responds, flirt just a little. If he's interested and has any balls, he'll take it from there. 
2. Be awesome. Be fun. Add something to his night. Make your personality attractive. 
3. Watch how he reacts to you. If he's not interested or doesn't seem genuine, eject. 
4. Don't make the first approach in front of his friends. Try to isolate him, even if it's just by having him turn away from the group. This will change the dynamic more than you know. 
5. Go over to /r/loseit and do what they say. I might get downvoted for this, but anyone who tells you otherwise is doing you a disservice. The old ""you're fine no matter what, the world needs to accept you as you are,"" is the most harmful line of bullshit infesting our discourse today. It may be harder for you than some, but never believe you have to be fat, and never believe you should accept yourself that way. Others will tell you so. Don't listen. 

**You should not let this ruin the entire bar/dating scene for you!** You need to get back out there and try again. Go by yourself again, don't bring friends along for support.

"c59t1l0","I was 17 years old when my father died. I was in school, we had an orienteering day, so of course it was raining. My father had diabetes, he was about 1.9+ meters tall, overweight. As a result, he had what is called diabetic feet, causing him to go in and out of the hospital on a rather regular basis. Anyways, he just came out from the hospital the week before, on crutches, so it was natural for him to be soar in his shoulders and arms, and as such, he thought nothing of it. I called him when I was lost, I knew he had a way to calm me down and get me focused. Usually he would use a rather disciplinary, not a cruel but direct and harsh, way of telling me what I should do, but this time he was very understanding.

When I came home, he was already there in the kitchen, drinking coffee. So I sat down, took a cup and asked him how he was, to which he complained about his left shoulder, and simultaneously blamed the crutches. I told him I'll be in the living room, watching TV. The Simpsons was on, and I just had a feeling something was weird. After half-watching TV for about 10-15 minutes, I heard him snoring. I thought he was tired because of the surgery and all, but I thought I'd go check on him. There he was, torso on the kitchen table, vomiting some mixture of coffee and other body fluids. I panicked, ran to get a phone and called 911. 

They instructed me how to performCPR. There I was, in this strange liquid, trying to start his heart again. Suddenly, his head began to turn blue, and I asked what I should do about it. She just told me to keep performing CPR.

After what seemed like an eternity (it was only about 10-15 minutes) the EMTs arrived. They rushed him to the hospital where they declared him dead.

"c4t7dqy","Whilst I agree with what you're saying, as an Australian, I'm kind of glad that we don't have freedom of speech enshrined in law. If you would though, let me explain.

Not having a law giving us freedom of speech doesn't make us feel as though it is any less fundamental. However it does give people greater responsibility for the shit that comes out of their mouths. 

So we're allowed to swear (I don't think a day goes past without there being a language warning slip on the public radio stations). But things that the Westboro church does would be a HUGE no no. There are no people swarming around abortion clinics flinging shit at the people who dare to use them, in an attempt to make them feel unsure about themselves.

And despite people being allowed to say what they like about gays and how they shouldn't be allowed rights (within limits, otherwise they can be done for hate speech); they cannot do it in locations that are frequented by gay people. That would be an attack on individuals. You're still allowed to say ""whatever you want"", but the thing about the Westboro Church is that they're allowed to say ""whatever they want"", wherever they want ([except Canada](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_speech#Limitations)). Which makes their crap possibly the most disgusting. In Australia, I would reckon most of the things that they say would be silenced anyway.

TL/DR: Having no Bill of Rights doesn't take away our moral ability to tell when something is right or wrong; if anything I think it allows our moral ability to grow and change depending on the circumstances. Rather than knowing that something someone is saying it hurtful and cruel, but then having to weigh it up with whether or not it is legal and protected speech.

It's very interesting to me how selectively we label people sometimes.

This is just an example of the sort of selective empathy we all display depending on our own and cultural/societal prejudices and whatnot.

It seems that we always have some convenient reason or excuse why certain people don't *deserve* empathy - and often these people will be at one extreme of the societal spectrum or the other. Either very attractive or very ugly, very rich or very poor, etc etc.

Anyhow, again this is just an example. Anyone could think of many more examples of people targetted for abuse in all sectors.

"c4n3zp8","On the contrary, you can have a rational mindset while viewing others as inferior. For Example:

The Spartans would take every new born child, and if they showed any signs of deformation, malnutrition, ect.. they would promptly throw the baby off a cliff. These infants were inferior. However this culling of inferior infants led to a form of selective breeding (natural selection eliminating the weak.) This led the spartan people to be stronger and more militaristic, as they were indeed one of the strongest nations of their time. Very rational, perhaps very cruel, but very effective ways of treating ""inferior"" humans. 

With rational thought on banning gay marriage there are numerous arguments... Here are just a few:

Marriage is by definition a religious bond between a man and a woman, Many people believe that a gay couple should be united under a ""civil union"" giving the same rights without offending religious people

Also Many people see Marriage as a union of two people, that should be consummated in a sexual fashion. Many people view sex, between two people of the same sex as un-natural as this does not lead to the formation of new life. People see this as either alien, or a means in which individuals can seek ""false Pleasure."" These People do not want to endorse this.

There are also those who do not want to endorse gay marriage because of a cultural stigma. Immagine if you will if there was a law banning Drag, many people would not want to revoke the law because that would imply to peers that they support drag. Many people aslo do not want to support cultural taboos. 

There are also those who fear for the well being of children raised by a homosexual couple. Many people feel that, by having parents with an ""abnormal relationship"" that this will cause dammage or altered development as the child will be forced to learn about sexuality from an early age. People also fear for the development of an infant without the nurturing of a mother. (There are studies that show that breast milk is more healthy, and improves development of infants more than formula.)

These are just some arguments that use rational thought when arguing against gay marriage. That being said I support Gay Marriage, and I do not support Eugenics, however I felt the need to play Devil's advocate. 

A lot of the problems in our political world result from a failure to communicate. If people attempted to respectfully understand opposing views, rather than simply disregard them as lunacy and fight them, I believe we could accomplish much more.

"c4kr81u","* RULE 1: “Power is not only what you have, but what the enemy thinks you have.” Power is derived from 2 main sources – money and people. “Have-Nots” must build power from flesh and blood. (These are two things of which there is a plentiful supply. Government and corporations always have a difficult time appealing to people, and usually do so almost exclusively with economic arguments.)

* RULE 2: “Never go outside the expertise of your people.” It results in confusion, fear and retreat. Feeling secure adds to the backbone of anyone. (Organizations under attack wonder why radicals don’t address the “real” issues. This is why. They avoid things with which they have no knowledge.)

* RULE 3: “Whenever possible, go outside the expertise of the enemy.” Look for ways to increase insecurity, anxiety and uncertainty. (This happens all the time. Watch how many organizations under attack are blind-sided by seemingly irrelevant arguments that they are then forced to address.)

* RULE 4: “Make the enemy live up to its own book of rules.” If the rule is that every letter gets a reply, send 30,000 letters. You can kill them with this because no one can possibly obey all of their own rules. (This is a serious rule. The besieged entity’s very credibility and reputation is at stake, because if activists catch it lying or not living up to its commitments, they can continue to chip away at the damage.)

* RULE 5: “Ridicule is man’s most potent weapon.” There is no defense. It’s irrational. It’s infuriating. It also works as a key pressure point to force the enemy into concessions. (Pretty crude, rude and mean, huh? They want to create anger and fear.)

* RULE 6: “A good tactic is one your people enjoy.” They’ll keep doing it without urging and come back to do more. They’re doing their thing, and will even suggest better ones. (Radical activists, in this sense, are no different that any other human being. We all avoid “un-fun” activities, and but we revel at and enjoy the ones that work and bring results.)

* RULE 7: “A tactic that drags on too long becomes a drag.” Don’t become old news. (Even radical activists get bored. So to keep them excited and involved, organizers are constantly coming up with new tactics.)

* RULE 8: “Keep the pressure on. Never let up.” Keep trying new things to keep the opposition off balance. As the opposition masters one approach, hit them from the flank with something new. (Attack, attack, attack from all sides, never giving the reeling organization a chance to rest, regroup, recover and re-strategize.)

* RULE 9: “The threat is usually more terrifying than the thing itself.” Imagination and ego can dream up many more consequences than any activist. (Perception is reality. Large organizations always prepare a worst-case scenario, something that may be furthest from the activists’ minds. The upshot is that the organization will expend enormous time and energy, creating in its own collective mind the direst of conclusions. The possibilities can easily poison the mind and result in demoralization.)

* RULE 10: “If you push a negative hard enough, it will push through and become a positive.” Violence from the other side can win the public to your side because the public sympathizes with the underdog. (Unions used this tactic. Peaceful [albeit loud] demonstrations during the heyday of unions in the early to mid-20th Century incurred management’s wrath, often in the form of violence that eventually brought public sympathy to their side.)

* RULE 11: “The price of a successful attack is a constructive alternative.” Never let the enemy score points because you’re caught without a solution to the problem. (Old saw: If you’re not part of the solution, you’re part of the problem. Activist organizations have an agenda, and their strategy is to hold a place at the table, to be given a forum to wield their power. So, they have to have a compromise solution.)

* RULE 12: “Pick the target, freeze it, personalize it, and polarize it.” Cut off the support network and isolate the target from sympathy.

"c4in0s0","Well, the death penalty was abolished for awhile and came back in the 70s so somewhere around there. The system envisioned the DA using their discretion to put death notices in the cases that were heinous and cruel, but some years later they realized that the procedural advantage was within the scope of the law. The Florida legislature does not jump to changing death penalty laws (See the unanimous jury thing I speak of somewhere else. There is a Supreme Court of Florida Case from like 3 years back where the court literally says ""we think the legislature needs to look at this and decide if Florida really wants to be the only state using this method.) Nothing since.

As it stands the current governor doesn't give twos hits about death penalty. He basically signs a warrant when public outcry says he isn't tough on crime. There are quoted interviews where he says he has no opinion on the death penalty because he literally doesn't care about it. The Florida structure is that the inmates sit on death row until the governor decides to off one and signs a warrant. 

The reason states like Texas have such a high number of executions is the function is built in judicially. Once the last appeal of an inmate is exhausted, they automatically get a death warrant signed by the court. So Florida has to approve each and every death by a governor, while Texas automatically puts you in the line of fire when you are done with appeals.

The fact of the matter is, the vast majority of us know when this type of humour is appropriate.  It is not appropriate to bully people or to mock or tease them in person.

There are a million smart, compassionate ways to deal with her situation, and she didn't choose any of them.

Even when that 'other' happens to have a disability.  The way the meme-makers are doing it is not deliberately nor directly harmful to that child.

What IS harmful and cruel is that the mother would allow her child to see those images of herself on the Internet.

This is very noticeable during storms etc. However when you already have a gentle roll and and the swell becomes more and more you don't notice the motion as much as you body has adjusted to it. (You can test this out n an amusement park. One day take the kiddy rides then go ontot he more adult rides and you won't lose your lunch.

I left r/bestof when I learned about DepthHub because, frankly, DepthHub offered me everything I was looking for, and failing to find, in r/bestof.

There is no system that exists that would not allow fear and ignorance to be leveraged. I would argue that short-sightedness and selfishness and a lack of empathy, as well as a rigid need to cling to simplistic solutions is the psychological bias being gamed by libertarian politicians and theorists.

I'll admit, I'm gamed by the notion of ""Let's help people."" I'm a sucker for wanting to work from the world as it currently exists, and try and make existence better for those for whom it sucks most. It's just that I've never encountered a Libertarian solution that starts with the proposition, ""Let's make life better for the weakest and most vulnerable among us.""

I'm a radical leftist, I guess, because that's the kind of principle I start from.

""This is mine, and under no circumstance, even if I don't need it and you desperately do, even to survive, that's right, even if your life is on the line, under no circumstance do you get even a little bit unless I say so.""

Now they might use more flowery language to get the same message across, but in the end, the meaning is the same. And I can't support that. To me? That's mental illness, right there. Not saying you *would* withhold something that would save a life, but saying you should have the *right* to. That is mental illness.

Was there a safer way to do it? Sure, I'm not saying there wasn't. But it was controlled. The doors were not ""busted open"", they were still locked by the chain so they could only crack open. But the point is if Shane hadn't forced the group to kill the zombies, the reality is it would never had happened until the zombies somehow escaped.

And sure, doing it in front of the family was cruel, but necessary. They had to see it for themselves that these zombies are no longer their loved ones.

I completely disagree. Yes, it was cruel (but necessary) to force them to witness it. But the sister completely lost her mind, and no one of her family tried to stop her.

Completely unnecessary and cruel treatment of Shane. Then Shane helps her, and after all the drama they had, she asks him to stay. She could have made her reasoning clear. 'I don't love you but I think the group needs you and you've proven that today, so if YOU want to stay, I think we can be friends'. But no, she allows him to jump to assumptions and have hope. Then we he acts on that hope she's given him, she goes and tells Rick to kill him. She's cruel and I dislike her a great deal.

I don't really feel that they're the love of each other's lives to that extreme. I do think Shane loves her and is having a hell of a time dealing with his feelings though. But even if they were true-love, you can't have that kinda attitude when the world ends. Even if Shane did feels that way, I think his actions with Andrea are still understandable.

"c3s3ouj","So women are, in general, of similar stature and strength to men given how they naturally mature? Women are, on the whole, capable of physically defending themselves as well as men (again, this is a sweeping generalisation about the builds of women vs. men)?

The point is, I think, not ""let's treat women like they need to be kept in a box to survive!"" The point is that no human being ought to have to go through such abuse, especially at the hands of someone they trust and maybe even love.

As I don't have specific data to hand, I'm not capable of providing any citations, but I would assume that the majority of serious cases of domestic violence are men beating women, again because of physical differences between the genders. As such, even if we assume here that the point is being made that she is female and as such it's worse than if it were a female trying to beat and possibly kill a male (which, I think, we are not), women are (again, a sweeping generalisation to do with how we mature - I just think I ought to stress this for reasons explained later in this comment) generally of a smaller and weaker frame than men, at least in my experience.

Your problem (and the reason that there is a small outcry of support for netr0) is that you seem to be incapable of seeing the difference between recognising that domestic abuse is not to be tolerated against anyone/recognising that women are generally of a smaller stature than men and discriminating against women and treating them differently just because they were born with a vagina. I wholeheartedly support the former because if we didn't do that then our society would be a hell of a lot more brutal and cruel, but the latter is just wrong.

If you want an analogy:

* I would liken the recognition of the problems in domestic abuse against women to the recognition that using black people as slaves was cruel and unethical (at least, by current Western society).

* I would liken discrimination against women to segregation and the treating of black people differently from white people or the immediate assumption by some that all people of a particular faith or ethnicity are going to bomb airports and kill people. Of course, there's a whole other rant I could have about racism vs. prejudice and the misuse of those terms as well as the lack of justice in the world about that, but it's 5.17 in the morning and that would be too far off topic.

**TL;DR: Your immediate condemnation of someone as a sexist for recognising that there are physical differences between men and women and acknowledging that acts of violence against women (and men, for that matter) are wrong is why some feminists really rub me up the wrong way. Please try to consider the reasoning behind such a rash condemnation before you make it or share it.**

That said, I realise that this may have been an honest mistake, but I thought I ought to give my take on the issue anyway. As such, I hope you have a pleasant morning/afternoon/evening/night and I apologise for posting this clusterfuck of tired ranting, but hope that it might help to promote recognising the difference between cases similar to the situations I've outlined.

Death by burning at the stake?  Both cruel and unusual?  Being looked down on by prison guards because you're a felon?  Neither cruel, nor unusual.

Things in between?  Well that's where people tend to disagree.

And since God didn't give us a handy list to consult, we go by the standards of our society.  And our society doesn't consider mandatory minimum sentences cruel and since they're in legislation, they won't be unusual when applied.  Plenty of people consider them to be *a bad idea*, but that's not cruelty.

And so it comes back to whether or not our society considers a long jail offence cruel for illegal possession of a gun.

Do we?  I maintain that we don't consider it cruel, unfair or illegitimate in any way.  If that's true, then the judge overstepped her bounds.

The only way to argue that the judge did not do so is to argue that *by the standards of our society*, long incarceration for illegal gun possession is unreasonable.

OP, I recommend eating as many fruits and veggies as you can get down, take a look at the slide in the William Li talk (at 13:00) and try to base your diet around those foods.

"c3jglzi","He wrote the playbook:

Alinsky's 12 rules for radicals or how to be a dick to win power.

* RULE 1: “Power is not only what you have, but what the enemy thinks you have.” Power is derived from 2 main sources – money and people. “Have-Nots” must build power from flesh and blood. (These are two things of which there is a plentiful supply. Government and corporations always have a difficult time appealing to people, and usually do so almost exclusively with economic arguments.)

* RULE 2: “Never go outside the expertise of your people.” It results in confusion, fear and retreat. Feeling secure adds to the backbone of anyone. (Organizations under attack wonder why radicals don’t address the “real” issues. This is why. They avoid things with which they have no knowledge.)

* RULE 3: “Whenever possible, go outside the expertise of the enemy.” Look for ways to increase insecurity, anxiety and uncertainty. (This happens all the time. Watch how many organizations under attack are blind-sided by seemingly irrelevant arguments that they are then forced to address.)

* RULE 4: “Make the enemy live up to its own book of rules.” If the rule is that every letter gets a reply, send 30,000 letters. You can kill them with this because no one can possibly obey all of their own rules. (This is a serious rule. The besieged entity’s very credibility and reputation is at stake, because if activists catch it lying or not living up to its commitments, they can continue to chip away at the damage.)

* RULE 5: “Ridicule is man’s most potent weapon.” There is no defense. It’s irrational. It’s infuriating. It also works as a key pressure point to force the enemy into concessions. (Pretty crude, rude and mean, huh? They want to create anger and fear.)

* RULE 6: “A good tactic is one your people enjoy.” They’ll keep doing it without urging and come back to do more. They’re doing their thing, and will even suggest better ones. (Radical activists, in this sense, are no different that any other human being. We all avoid “un-fun” activities, and but we revel at and enjoy the ones that work and bring results.)

* RULE 7: “A tactic that drags on too long becomes a drag.” Don’t become old news. (Even radical activists get bored. So to keep them excited and involved, organizers are constantly coming up with new tactics.)

* RULE 8: “Keep the pressure on. Never let up.” Keep trying new things to keep the opposition off balance. As the opposition masters one approach, hit them from the flank with something new. (Attack, attack, attack from all sides, never giving the reeling organization a chance to rest, regroup, recover and re-strategize.)

* RULE 9: “The threat is usually more terrifying than the thing itself.” Imagination and ego can dream up many more consequences than any activist. (Perception is reality. Large organizations always prepare a worst-case scenario, something that may be furthest from the activists’ minds. The upshot is that the organization will expend enormous time and energy, creating in its own collective mind the direst of conclusions. The possibilities can easily poison the mind and result in demoralization.)

* RULE 10: “If you push a negative hard enough, it will push through and become a positive.” Violence from the other side can win the public to your side because the public sympathizes with the underdog. (Unions used this tactic. Peaceful [albeit loud] demonstrations during the heyday of unions in the early to mid-20th Century incurred management’s wrath, often in the form of violence that eventually brought public sympathy to their side.)

* RULE 11: “The price of a successful attack is a constructive alternative.” Never let the enemy score points because you’re caught without a solution to the problem. (Old saw: If you’re not part of the solution, you’re part of the problem. Activist organizations have an agenda, and their strategy is to hold a place at the table, to be given a forum to wield their power. So, they have to have a compromise solution.)

* RULE 12: Pick the target, freeze it, personalize it, and polarize it.” Cut off the support network and isolate the target from sympathy.

"c3iqz4l","1) CS Lewis is notorious for poorly thought out ideas and poor arguments. He's also notorious for writing things that at first glance seem persuasive.

2) Christian arguments often rely on metaphors. An argument from metaphor is typically a poor argument that can also be persuasive to people who don't really think about it. So keep an eye out, once you realize that you'll start to notice it everywhere. An argument from metaphor is only effective if there are a lot of shared characteristics and few dissimilar ones.

&gt; My argument against God was that the universe seemed so cruel and unjust

He's cleverly substituting the phrase ""the universe"" when he means ""the behavior of people"". He's doing this because sometimes the terms are interchangeable, but in this case he's misusing the word to fool you. Most arguments against the existence of a *good loving powerful god* include the behavior of A) humans or B) an all-good all-powerful all-loving god. Again, he's perfectly aware of the very important distinction from any god to a good loving powerful god, and the distinction between a sort of general ""the universe"" and a god who claims to hold the three omnis but the evidence indicates he/she/it doesn't. He's intentionally confusing the three because vagueness works for him later on when he wants to switch back to fool you.

&gt; But how had I got this idea of just and unjust? .. What was I comparing this universe with when I called it unjust? 

Hey suddenly he changed ""cruel and unjust"" to ""just and unjust"". Why? Natural disasters can be cruel, nature can be cruel, but only the behavior of people can be unjust. So he fools you by starting out saying he's critiquing the argument that the universe is cruel and unjust - unsuspecting readers agree - then he switches it to only unjust and just. He's seamlessly transitioning from the actual Problem of Evil towards a strawman version of it.

&gt;  If the universe has no meaning

The universe doesn't have ""meaning"". The universe is (this layman's understanding of) objects in a location. That's like saying Cleveland has meaning, or a moon on a far away galaxy has meaning. Places don't have ""meaning"".

So I suspect he's changing the word universe - another shady redefinition - to mean something like ""an emotion which  motivates *Homo sapiens*"" or ""the desires of a good powerful loving god who created *Homo sapiens*"". But without clarification it's really hard to nail it down.

&gt; we should never have found out it has no meaning: just as, if there was no light in the universe and therefore no creatures with eyes, we should never know it was dark. Dark would be a word without meaning

Here's why I think he meant ""the universe having meaning"" to something like ""the desires of a god who created *Homo sapiens*"". Let's examine the argument, keeping mind a good argument from metaphor needs to have similar objects being compared:

* Light is a term used to describe electromagnetic radiation in a range from about 380 nanometres to about 740 nm, with a frequency range of about 405 THz to 790 THz
* Light and dark are terms used to describe changes in the wavelength of some electromagnetic radiation
* Light exists, the terms light and dark exist
* If light doesn't exist then words describing light wouldn't exist

Vs

* The universe means the desires of an all-good all-powerful all-loving god who appears not exist because of the Problem of Evil
* Just and unjust are terms used to describe the actions of *Homo sapiens*
* We're applying the terms to describe the behavior of an alleged god
* When we apply the terms to describe the behavior of he/she/it the evidence appears he/she/it doesn't exist
* But it's possible he/she/it exists and we just lack the vocabulary to understand why we don't have to worry about the Problem of Evil *just like dark wouldn't exist if it didn't exist!*

It's nonsense: it's a poor argument and it rests on vague changing definitions sprinkled with intentional deception. It's worth noting it's seemingly designed for people unfamiliar with the Problem of Evil.

They were in Dallas all weekend with the dogs. Read all the reports:
They checked out of their hotel saturday mid morning and was on their
way to the next hotel and stop for a quick bite to eat meeting
friends, one of which was a police officer himself. He saw the seat
down and the DPD officers that were there on the scene know this! They
know the fire dept messed up- it was not the police that did this.
Read ALL the articles- it was the fire dept. But still, all in all the

their next hotel thus having the dogs with them still spending their
money in our city. I dont see anything wrong with what they did on a
55 degree cloudy day. Ask the parking lot attendant when they left the
lot. You know he remembers that girls tons of blonde curls.
Furthermore the city is making the case for the Shipmans by claiming
the dogs were locked in the trunk, when in fact they were not.
REGARDLESS, The fact the city is claiming they were in the truck is
proving they could have and should have broken a window out to
""rescue"" the dogs much faster and safer. Since they say the dogs were
locked in the trunk then their full of u know what for saying they
couldnt break a window for fear the glass would or could hurt the
dogs. Mmmmmm waaaaait a minute Mr Fireman YOU said the dogs were in
the trunk so how is it that they could get hurt with glass being broke
IF they werent in the car? Proves their lying trying to cover their
butts! They didn't see the dogs is what the witnesses and the DFD are
saying.... Their Yorkies are small- how do they know they werent under
the seats? Then as if everything they did wasnt stupid enough they
continued to use 2 police cars and 4 officers to guard the car they
destroyed for over another hour and a half when the couple left the
parking lot ""because there were unsecure valuables in the car"" But yet
couldnt wait for them in the very beginning for a few? OR do some real

left the dogs in their car for 20-30 minutes it was illegal and Cruel
but the city takes them and puts them in their car for an hour and a

Theyre going to burn up in the sonata but not in their car? What in

against leaving pets in your car nor does the city of dallas have an
ordnance against it. The states animal cruelty law says severe and
extreme hot and humid temps or severe extreme or freezing temps or

DFD destroyed this car rescuing these dogs since DFD believed they
were in such severe and emanate danger then DFD took both dogs to be

"c36lwau","I know it sounds crazy, but some kids use books to escape reality in an unhealthy way. I was a counselor at a kids summer camp one year and we had to stop one of the kids from reading. It was cruel but necessary. One of the Harry Potter books had just come out and he wouldn't put it down, but it wasn't just harry, it was his way of not socializing what so ever. He took the book everywhere so he didn't have to talk to anyone, he would constantly try to sneak back to the cabin and read instead of going to his activities. He would try nothing new and would cry if anyone made him do anything. Half way through the 2 week session, we were playing games during cabin rest period and we discovered that he did not know one persons name in the cabin. He didn't know either of the counselors names and didn't know any of the kids names. Thats how secluded he had tried to stay. He also one time managed to lock everyone out of the cabin so he could read. Everyone came back from their morning activities to get ready for lunch and no one could get in the cabin. He coudln't give two fucks that people needed to change and what not. I personally think he was autistic but his parents hadn't gone to see a doctor about it. 

Now, you could say, so what, he's reading, there are worse things he could be doing. But one of the reasons his parents (and all parents) pay really good money to send their kids to camp was to get them to try and experience new things, meet new people, develop social skills. It's all part of the camp experience. He used reading as an excuse and escape to do none of these. Once the kids arrive at camp, they are not allowed to have their phones, ipods, gameboys, psps and whatever else technology there is. The reason for this is because I kid will keep to himself if he has these. this kid was using books for the same purpose but it just isn't as frowned upon because Reading is important and encouraged by society. 

It helped greatly that his older sister was a counselor there and she helped us out a ton when dealing with him. 

So when you ask Wilydoppleganger why his mother was mad at him for readin, there could be plenty of reasons.

But think of the natural order of life.  It is natural for us to eat meat, we have evolved in such a way.  Killing animals doesn't have to be cruel, but respectful (if you want an example, look to the Iroquois).  Certainly just killing your own food would not be the only thing that changed, your entire attitude towards food would change.

"c2zyvke","I'm actually doing research on prehistoric Native Americans on the Plains, and I've been reading a lot about their bison hunting practices, some of which were extremely wasteful.  For example, they would often corral an entire herd into a pound and kill all of them.  However, the Native Americans were only interested in the cows because the bulls' meat didn't taste as good.  Still, they believed they had to kill the entire herd, or else if one bison escaped it would be able to tell the other herds about this trapping method, and the method would no longer work.  Fortunately, there were enough bison to go around up until the Europeans arrived, so this wasteful practice was cruel but sustainable.  Perhaps the same could not be said for mammoths and mastodons 13,000 years ago...

Additionally, cities like [Cahokia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cahokia#Cahokia.27s_decline) were likely abandoned because the land around them became deforested, overfarmed, and over-hunted, causing people to spread out to new settlements and repeat the pattern.

"c2yz3ys","Best of luck to your dad and your family as he undergoes treatment.  Help your family members in whatever way you can, I found that that helped me when my mom went through cancer treatment (it was a terminal prognosis from day 1).  A diagnosis like this turns your life upside-down in an instant and all you can do is try to roll with it and help make the situation as good as possible for your father and the people around you.  

Also, I know this is easier said than done, but try not to play the blame game with yourself.  I've done that for close to 10 years and in the end all it did was make me an incredibly angry, frustrated person.  It starts out small but it can eventually transform into complete self-loathing without you even noticing it.  I'm just now resolving the resulting anxiety, depression, and insomnia problems that gradually built up over the course of nearly a decade (I'm not saying this exact thing will happen to you; my point is that the way you deal with this now WILL affect you in some way for the rest of your life, in ways that you can't anticipate now, so just think of this as a heads up).  It's normal to want to find something/someone to blame, to try to find a source of liability against which you can direct your anger, even if the object of your anger ends up being yourself.  This is a seductive urge no matter how reasonable a person you are.  It gives us the illusion of having some control over a situation that otherwise makes us feel powerless.  It also helps us derive some sense of purpose or value from a situation that otherwise seems senseless and cruel.  But once you get this self-blame out of your system a bit, which may take some time, cut yourself some slack.  Otherwise you may end up winding yourself up too tight later on down the road like I did.  I assume many atheists and people with highly rational sensibilities are especially susceptible to this because many of us value self-criticism, perfectionism, and learning from mistakes, and we aren't accustomed to feeling powerless.  These traits are a double-edged sword that can make you your own worst enemy when you shift blame onto yourself.  

Again, good luck to you and your dad.  I know strangers on reddit are pretty far down the list of people you're likely to talk to about this kind of stuff, but if you want an anonymous listener feel free to message me.

I agree with the feelings of unattractiveness and inadequacy.   I was that fat kid in high school, and didn't date anyone, and had only had sex with my wife.   I'm in much better shape now, but it's hard to get past it.   When she turned me down, it's hard not to feel unwanted.

I don't think it's for everyone.  I felt guilty almost the whole time I was doing it, but I will say I had a renewed vigor for life.   But the guilt was there, I was always nervous.

Not that people think logically, but it would be way more fair that the sexually dead party (ok, that's a bit strong, but you know what I mean) would agree to a sexually open relationship.   If I don't want to go shopping with my wife ever, but her friend wants to go with her, I won't stop her.   The same should be said for sex.   She doesn't want to be having it with me, but she doesn't want me having it with anyone else?  That's just selfish and cruel.

But after what happened last time, I just can't do it without her permission.

This would have all the bonuses of what you describe.  I agree, having sex outside of marriage has a lot of benefits, I just can't do it myself without feeling guilty.   And she's made it perfectly clear if anything ever happens again, she's gone - and will likely try to take full custody of our daughter (but hasn't said that).",1320507268,"that's just selfish and cruel.","selfish and cruel","cruel",NA,FALSE,"just selfish and cruel","selfish",NA,"just",0

"c2wk6rj","Can I also say, I googled ""Slam poetry"". This was the first result: 

Pucker

My love is deep and penetrating. Subterranean.
Large, thick, slow, deliberate, vulgar, low, archetypal, animalistic.
Ripe for splitting open, to be savored, enjoyed.
I am a pomegranate.

And you. 
You are everything that ever was
And everything that ever shall be.
I could pray to you.
And, so it begins.

You take me in your arms and fold me like a fan.
You lead me about the room.
My body is pliant, supple. Your hands 
stretch wide across my belly, self-assured.
Even your fingers are confident.

We are groveling.
Grinding.
Sinking deeper into it.
Slathering each other with it.

And then, I feel it.

It is traveling through my bowels
Like a vengeful eggplant on fire,
Violently pushing and gurgling its way 
through my lower intestine.
Mocking my sensuality.

For a moment I am shaken.

How can this be? I was so careful at dinner.
Oh God, the cauliflower.
Why? On this day of all days.
The day I wear the crown of woman.

I travel through time.
Suddenly I am 9 years old, in Sister Mercede’s 
4th grade class. And Christi Romalo, 
with her ample bosom and hairy upper lip,
Tells me I’m not cool enough to be in the 
7-Up club. And all my mother can tell me is,
“ Honey, sometimes life just isn’t fair.”

For a moment I fantasize
Just letting it rip.
Will you liken me to some winsome peasant?
Will you love the honesty of it?

Maybe you’ll think I’m earthy.

Next, I imagine standing up,
Clutching the bedpost and proudly declaring,
“ It is I, Flatula!”

Would that frighten you, my love?

My muscles tighten 
And I begin to pray, Sweet Baby Jesus
Let your light shine through me and 
Neutralize this demon squash-like gas.

I feel an enormous thrust. Is it over?
You cover me with kisses and tenderly pat my thigh. 
I tense up and hope for a miracle.
I whisper, “Sweet dreams, my love.”
Barely able to contain the monster inside me.

You begin to snore.

I press myself against the wall,
Adhering my buttocks firmly to it
And say twenty-seven Hail Marys.

I relax for one tiny moment and it moves,
Explodes.
And I am thrown from the bed.
Dear God help me!

A loose chunk of plaster breaks from the ceiling
And flies through the air.
I try to throw myself in front of it.
I try to cheat fate.

But it is too late.
Too late my love.
The plaster chunk delivers 
A cruel but swift death.

I cradle your dented head in my arms and I weep.
I weep for the cruelty of fate,
The loss of true love,
And my lack of muscle control.

I blame myself.

"c2u0pm7","[His Name Is Robert Downey Jr.: the kindest of strangers](http://aliciabessette.com/blog/?p=1104)

*EDIT: This is an article from someone else that I read about RDJ and had never seen before and had minimal attention since it was on a small blog. I'm just sharing someone else's story because I thought it was wonderful- I had absolutely no idea that this was going to get so much attention.*

I’m willing to go out on a limb here and guess that most stories of kindness do not begin with drug addicted celebrity bad boys.

Mine does.

His name is Robert Downey Jr.

You’ve probably heard of him. You may or may not be a fan, but I am, and I was in the early 90’s when this story takes place.

It was at a garden party for the ACLU of Southern California. My stepmother was the executive director, which is why I was in attendance without having to pay the $150 fee. It’s not that I don’t support the ACLU, it’s that I was barely twenty and had no money to speak of.

I was escorting my grandmother. There isn’t enough room in this essay to explain to you everything she was, I would need volumes, so for the sake of brevity I will tell you that she was beautiful even in her eighties, vain as the day is long, and whip smart, though her particular sort of intelligence did not encompass recognizing young celebrities.

I pointed out Robert Downey Jr. to her when he arrived, in a gorgeous cream-colored linen suit, with Sarah Jessica Parker on his arm. My grandmother shrugged, far more interested in piling her paper plate with various unidentifiable cheeses cut into cubes. He wasn’t Carey Grant or Gregory Peck. What did she care?

The afternoon’s main honoree was Ron Kovic, whose story of his time in the Vietnam War that had left him confined to a wheelchair had recently been immortalized in the Oliver Stone film Born on the Fourth of July.

I mention the wheelchair because it played an unwitting role in what happened next.

We made our way to our folding chairs in the garden with our paper plates and cubed cheeses and we watched my stepmother give one of her eloquent speeches and a plea for donations, and there must have been a few other people who spoke but I can’t remember who, and then Ron Kovic took the podium, and he was mesmerizing, and when it was all over we stood up to leave, and my grandmother tripped.

We’d been sitting in the front row (nepotism has its privileges) and when she tripped she fell smack into the wheelchair ramp that provided Ron Kovic with access to the stage. I didn’t know that wheelchair ramps have sharp edges, but they do, at least this one did, and it sliced her shin right open.

The volume of blood was staggering.

I’d like to be able to tell you that I raced into action; that I quickly took control of the situation, tending to my grandmother and calling for the ambulance that was so obviously needed, but I didn’t. I sat down and put my head between my knees because I thought I was going to faint. Did I mention the blood?

Luckily, somebody did take control of the situation, and that person was Robert Downey Jr.

He ordered someone to call an ambulance. Another to bring a glass of water. Another to fetch a blanket. He took off his gorgeous linen jacket and he rolled up his sleeves and he grabbed hold of my grandmother’s leg, and then he took that jacket that I’d assumed he’d taken off only to it keep out of the way, and he tied it around her wound. I watched the cream colored linen turn scarlet with her blood.

He told her not to worry. He told her it would be alright. He knew, instinctively, how to speak to her, how to distract her, how to play to her vanity. He held onto her calf and he whistled. He told her how stunning her legs were.

She said to him, to my humiliation: “My granddaughter tells me you’re a famous actor but I’ve never heard of you.”

He stayed with her until the ambulance came and then he walked alongside the stretcher holding her hand and telling her she was breaking his heart by leaving the party so early, just as they were getting to know each other. He waved to her as they closed the doors. “Don’t forget to call me, Silvia,” he said. “We’ll do lunch.”

He was a movie star, after all.

Believe it or not, I hurried into the ambulance without saying a word. I was too embarrassed and too shy to thank him.

We all have things we wish we’d said. Moments we’d like to return to and do differently. Rarely do we get that chance to make up for those times that words failed us. But I did. Many years later.

I should mention here that when Robert Downey Jr. was in prison for being a drug addict (which strikes me as absurd and cruel, but that’s the topic for a different essay), I thought of writing to him. Of reminding him of that day when he was humanity personified. When he was the best of what we each can be. When he was the kindest of strangers.

But I didn’t.

Some fifteen years after that garden party, ten years after my grandmother had died and five since he’d been released from prison, I saw him in a restaurant.

I grew up in Los Angeles where celebrity sightings are commonplace and where I was raised to respect people’s privacy and never bother someone while they’re out having a meal, but on this day I decided to abandon the code of the native Angeleno, and my own shyness, and I approached his table.

I said to him, “I don’t have any idea if you remember this…” and I told him the story.

He remembered.

“I just wanted to thank you,” I said. “And I wanted to tell you that it was simply the kindest act I’ve ever witnessed.”

He stood up and he took both of my hands in his and he looked into my eyes and he said, “You have absolutely no idea how much I needed to hear that today.”

"c2sg0zi","Hey, no problem at all :)

Don't ever feel that way about yourself.  I'm sure while he says things like that in moments of stress, he wouldn't change having you in his life for anything.  I'd bet anything you're the joy in his life, something to work for and his own personal great achievement even if it might not happen to be the achievement he foresaw for himself earlier in life.  Sometimes they use us as their punching bags but it doesn't mean they don't love us :)

&gt;I don't exactly know why he originally moved here, as he says it'd be too much for me to understand.

Hmm, that sounds like family issues (as in issues with his family).  You'll probably never know the full story, I've only learnt my family's treacherous back history from bits and pieces accidentally told to me over the years.   He probably doesn't want to dump a lifetime of family shit onto a 15 year old's shoulders.

I would definitely bring up moving out with your Dad again, especially if he's emotional about it.  That means it's something he REALLY wants to do and if he has you on side, he might get the confidence to get out of there and start fresh.   We can all become prisoners to routine sometimes, so much so that we can get comfortable in it and the thought of changing that is daunting.  Speaking from experience here.

Maybe look at real estate places/websites for your area, see if there's a nice, fairly cheap two bedroom place for rent and show it to him.  

With the food situation, he should just leave some food for her.  I know she's being ridiculously difficult and cruel but if you can avoid the back talking, just do it.  Then she won't have any ammunition :)

Yeah, back talking is the worst.  My whole family does it and it drives me crazy that they wont just confront each other.  I think the generation before us was taught by their parents to avoid any fights, arguments, confrontations whatsoever because my family cannot maturely discuss anything at all!  It always ends in a screaming match or they simply never bring it up and bottle it all up instead.  It's very frustrating and, from what I've noticed, no one from my generation really understands that way of dealing with issues.  ""Silence hurts the most"" really hit home for me, I can completely relate to the damage silence does.  

The best thing you can do is not be like that.  Don't follow suit and fall into their habits because it's unhealthy and affects you too.  I wonder if your parents have any idea of how their own child feels?  Parents forget their kids mental stability so often in situations like this.  I've seen a loveless marriage shatter to pieces and the after effects are still being felt by the kids involved, two of whom are adults now, but each parent has found their own superficial happiness now so they assume the children have, too.   They haven't.

Wow, that's pretty bad of your Dad to look down on you getting a job.  Have you discussed it with him?  Employers are pretty cool about kids still at school, I'm sure if they want to take you on they will work a roster around your schooling.  A couple of after school shifts a week wouldn't hurt at all, and remind him it's more money for the family in the end ;)

I've done long shifts at odd hours - 4:20am starts to be exact - and they do mess with you (my health plummeted when I was working those shifts, I just couldn't get well again) so she may be suffering a bit from that.  I felt my health improve almost instantly once I left that horrible job lol.  I'm still young, she's older and it takes older people longer to recover from stuff and physical stress hits them a lot harder than it does us.   It doesn't excuse her attitude one bit but it might make it a bit easier to understand.  Next time she snaps, you can just think ""Well, she must be exhausted"" or something like that.  Makes it a little easier to cope.  Same with your Dad, too.

You've said plenty on here about your situation (I know it's easier on the net), maybe just repeat some of what you've said here to your friends and see what they say?  I don't know about your parents rules but you could sleep over at your friends sometimes just to get out of the house for a few days.  

Yeah, most teachers are useless and non caring about students so unless there's one you really click with, don't bother.

Well, from what you've told me, it sounds like you're doing everything you can to be a good son (or daughter?! Just realised I don't know haha!)  and help out where you can so just keep doing what you do.  You're still just a kid in a lot of ways and you're doing your best in a rather impossible situation.  Just know that your father does care about you and that I can see that just from what you've written here, despite never having met either of you in my life.  He wants the best for you and the best he can give to you.  :)

Try to bring up you getting a job (say you'd love to work and help with the bills, you'd feel great helping him out and contributing) and moving out, see what he says, just put the ideas in his head maybe he'll come around.  

Just think, once you're 18, you can do whatever the hell you like.

If nothing else, well, you can always just vent to me in a PM if you like :)  ",1318950464,"i know she's being ridiculously difficult and cruel but if you can avoid the back talking, just do it.","difficult and cruel","cruel",NA,FALSE,"ridiculously difficult and cruel","difficult",NA,"ridiculously",0

"c2j2af8","&gt; So... can anyone tell me where we're supposed to get our dogs from?

From...the pound. We've been over this. If more people bred responsibly, then maybe this wouldn't be a big deal or a hitpoint for a lot of us. But because THOUSANDS of dogs are killed every day from poor breeding choices or accidental breeding choices, we're against IRRESPONSIBLE breeding. Not to mention that many ""pure"" lines have gotten so disgustingly inbred that there are many, many problems within the lines themselves. That's horrible, and cruel. But I know most people don't breed responsibly. People breed for cash because little animals are ""cute"" and then charge $250 for a dog that's ""pure"" on Craigslist and is living with 50 other ""cute"" dogs in the same home. This is MOST of the breeding that goes on.

I heard the same argument for horses once. ""If we don't breed, no more horses!..."" But many horses are bred for fun because people like baby animals, have poor breeding and some have MAJOR issues and aren't desirable as pets. That's the irresponsibility.

Your first point, I agree with you. If an animal is comfortable and not unhappy, then there isn't a reason you shouldn't own it. Obviously if you own a feral squirrel and have it in a cage because he's fluffy, you're not treating the animal correctly. If you raised him from a baby and he depends on you, then that's different.

Third point is similar to the second. You have to remember that you aren't the only person involved when it comes to breeding. You have SEVERAL other lives involved, and we want them to be safe. A lot of us - don't take this personally - don't care about the breeder. We care about your animals. There are far too many abandoned animals and babies for me to ever feel good about someone who wants to breed for cash. If you're breeding for fun, then you should keep all the babies, because cash in that sense is not secondary. I know you want to say it is, but it simply isn't. If you couldn't sell those babies, I'm sure you would stop breeding them (unless you have some super tank, in which case, bravo).

Either way and all ways, good luck. We're not going to stop you...I'm not either. Be responsible and considerate of ALL lives when doing anything that has to do with animals.

"c2bm7tw","Here is a start. The Secret Gospel of Mark
http://www.religioustolerance.org/chr_miss1.html 

A missing part of Mark's writings was found in 1958 and was proven to be authentic. It is called ""The Secret Gospel of Mark."" Mark was indeed Jesus' lover and truly the only one who stood by Him until the end. 
Of course religious leaders call it phony because they assert so much control over other's lives with fear. So much of the writings of those who were alive at the time Jesus were plagiarized and twisted. I have no doubt those lies have been being corrected throughout history. I am not gay and have no dog in this fight but am so glad many gays have been freed from guilt by this news. Jesus freed them back then by God's own words to him for them but the religious leaders of the day killed that news fast. just think of all the suffering that could have been averted had the leaders not been jealous of the people's love for hi freeing messages from God on many subjects.

It's the same with any wildly charismatic and truly gifted wonderful lovely people today. People steal their work, tell lies about them, claim to do the things they did and it's all from jealousy and greed. 

I remember Bruce Springsteen talking about how the people of his hometown reacted when he became famous. He said they told many lies about him, took credit for the songs he wrote, sold phony stories about him. Jealousy. Is there anyone you know who hasn't heard of Jesus? Some gays knew by reading his words, what little was mostly kept intact, that He must be gay. The same is said about King David. He did not steal Bathsheba from her husband because he fell in love with her when he saw her bathing. He rescued her from an abusive man when he saw her beaten body. Then he sent her husband to the front lines where he knew he would most certainly die. 

Both very great great men and One earned the right to be called God's son. As through adoption, not immaculate conception. Jesus' mother was actually very abusive and cruel. But he rose above all that and was openly gay at a time and place where having a gay relationship meant death and still had no guile in Him. He was the most abused man in history according to prophecy in Isaiah 52:14 and still loved unrestrained. I think that proves why God would make him equal to himself as that is God's very nature.

Anyway, I do agree that tagging Chinese on the whole as cruel is not appropriate. There are cruel practices - cruel to animals on the whole and cruel to humans in specific - in all parts of the world. Some are more prominent and some aren't. Specially, most Americans I see complaining about Chinese cruelty find dog and cat meat as absolute cruelty while chicken breasts and buffalo wings are OK. And I assume most Chinese would find the now-rare practice of consuming human babies or monkey brains extremely cruel but wont care much about dog or cat meat. On the other hand a cannibal guy from a primitive tribe would find human meat OK but find it hard to kill members of his own family. 

I personally dont like the Chinese that consume every animal that's digestible, the Americans who take pride in their 'Hunting Trophy's, the Indians (and probably many other cultures, but I happen to know a lot of Indian Hindus) who 'sacrifice' animals for their imaginary Gods, the Muslims who think Allah told them its OK to eat animals after bleeding them to death, the Christians (of course most other religions too) who feel all animals (all nature around them for that matter) have been created for human consumption/entertainment. That doesn't mean I dont like all of Chinese/Americans/Indians/Muslims/Christians. I just hope I am right and the others whom I dont like currently, start seeings things the way I see and maybe change themselves.

He is not *entitled* to ANYTHING. The only thing you two are mutually entitled to is your own bodies and your own decisions. His entitlement ends where yours begins. He wasn't doing it with you, he was doing it *to* you, and it was without your permission -- with the opposite, your order to stop. You don't have to offer him anything in return or to make up for the lost second half of sex. You can even intentionally get him hard and leave. Now, that's ridiculous and arguably cruel, but it does not give him permission to rape you. Or even cheat on you. The only thing he could do is dump you.

He should not be pestering you to give him sex or any sexual favors. Why shouldn't you pester him to *not* beg for sexual favors? The thing is that you two should not annoy or pester each other, and if anybody doesn't want to participate in something, they do not have to, and the other person must adapt to that. If you say no to sex, he does not gain the right to rape you, and he does not gain the right to even cheat on you.

You need to sit down with this guy and give him a serious talk. You need to tell him that he will start to respect you and this behavior will end, or [bad result that I think should be a break-up but it feels like I'm being too bossy] will happen. This is abuse.

"c1x772t","The War of the Ninepenny Kings was part of the Blackfyre Rebellion; the end of it actually.  Admittedly, the Rebellion did last something like 3 generations, but the fighting was spotted and never included the entire realm (except for the very first rebellion led by Daemon Blackfyre).  The War of the Ninepenny Kings never even made it to the shores of Westeros; it was fought entirely on Essos and the Stepstones (the island chain that used to be a land bridge from Dorne to Essos).  The peasants never saw a lick of that fighting.

But you're right about smallfolk not knowing their history.  They have no education so the only history they know is passed down orally from generation to generation, which is precisely why they probably only know about the major wars and events of the past.  There could have been tons of little skirmishes during the Targaryen dynasty, but the smallfolk of today wouldn't know about them.

All the smallfolk really know is what they've experienced.  So take, for example, your average 30something farmer and his family at the time of Robert's Rebellion.  All he's known his whole life is peace under a Targaryen king.  Some people say he's mad and cruel, but the farmer has never suffered his wrath and his life is pretty uneventful outside the regular toils of farming and peasanthood.  Then all of a sudden, his liege lord decides to go to war with the king, for reasons that the farmer doesn't care about.  His village gets sacked by the ""enemy"" and he lose everything.

""Such is the way of war,"" sighs the farmer and he packs up for a new village with his family to start over.  Say this farmer was unfortunate enough to move to a village somewhere on the west coast of Westeros.  3 years later, a bunch of Ironmen come and destroy his village again, except this time they kill his sons and make off with his daughters and wife.

Broken again, but lucky to be alive, the farmer has to start over all again.  It takes him a long time to finally get on his feet, because it's harder without a family to help you, but 9 years later he's finally got a working livelihood again.  He's even got a new young wife and they're trying to start another family... till yet another war breaks out.  Gregor Clegane flattens his village.  And then later the Bloody Mummers come through and flatten it again.  And then a huge pack of wild wolves.  And then some hedge knights turned outlaws.  It never ends.

All the farmer knows is that this sort of thing never happened when the Targaryen was king.  And besides, he was the rightful king anyway!  The Targaryens ruled for pretty much all of time, right?  The farmer is sick of all the wars and fighting.  He just wants everything to go back to the way it was before all these wars.  Damn the usurper and damn all the houses that helped him!  The farmer can't start a war on his own, but he secretly prays for the day that everything would go back to the way it was before Robert's Rebellion.

"c1vuyf6","Sorry for the late reply. About the Matthew 25:46, I was truly curious too. I did some research on it, and it seem to be a bad translation from Greek. It is quite a big shock to me, but it does seem to make sense how it is a bad translation.(I'm going to study the language of the bible now to avoid things like this.) I'm going to direct you to someone else for this matter for it will take a long time to explain. http://www.tentmaker.org/articles/EternalPunishmentNotTrueToGreek.html Now with that I don't think God will separated your love one from you for eternity.  Then about the your opinion about God encouraging all sort of atrocities. I don't think he is encouraging. As I said before he have a different view point than us. The differences is a lot!!!! I know it does sound really harsh and cruel, but you can't denied the possibility of God doing it out of love. It is just like trying you teach a kid. The kid do not have the same views as you. For him it might be just like torture, but you know it is good for him to teach him like that. Could you embrace this as God's way of teaching? However with this, people might mimic the way he teaches us. We can't do that because we are not God. He did not give us the authority to do that. Then about God's laws. The Egyptian and God have different laws. There is similarity, but there is a different. The similarity might be because of us having similarity to God. Then your opinion about animals. The animals does obey God wills. As you said above that the bears came out to kill the children. I do not know anything beyond this, but I will give you my opinion. I believe that God wills for an animal is instilled into an animal when he created it. It have its purposes and it lives its life doing just that. Then let us move on to the next part. I'm still sticking to the bible quote that said we can be like Jesus. Why do you say ""WHY we have to spend our lives apologizing for something that we didn't do"". We DID do it. We sin. Then to your last question: Why are you and your children paying for the actions of someone thousands of years ago? I'm hoping you are regarding to Adam and Eve. Then let me tell you why. Adam and Eve at first did not ate the fruit of knowledge, even without it they are capable of committing a sin. Then now imagine: With our knowledge, do you think it is easy for us? God put us here to learn and ""practice"" before putting us back to heaven.

"c1uq5uy","My younger sister killed herself on may 6th.   The best coping mechanism was writing and speaking the talk I gave at her funeral, as it forced me to take an honest look at everything.   I would recommend writing a similar talk, even if you aren't to speak at the funeral, and sharing it with friends and family.
the talk I gave follows. She had a heroin addiction and hung herself, but in the talk I refer to these only as ""illness and bad decisions"" for the sake of her 9 year old son. We told him that his mother had an illness in her mind and that it killed her, rather than leave him with thoughts of his mother abandoning him. 


Make no mistakes about it, Christin made my childhood a living Hell. She was as stubborn and angry as they come, with a cunning, cruel wit. When she resolved to do something, by god she did it. Unfortunately for me, that resolution often meant chewing the tails and horns off of my dinosaurs, or stealing the candy I had hidden in my room, or harassing and prodding me until I'd lose my temper and yell at her, at which time she'd levelly inform me that I had anger management issues and should seek the council of a mental health institution.... and I'm pretty sure she tried to convince Dad that I was gay. Yes, quite the sense of humor. 

Though to be fair, Heather did force her to hide under the dining room table for 6 hours once, under the threat of an imminent earthquake. So this was not a humor arrived at entirely independently.

It wasn't until high school that I discovered Christin had another quality; Loyalty.

You see, in high school, I had a small frame and a big mouth (suppose some things never change) and I had as many friends as I had enemies. Christin and I didn't speak at school, different friends, different interests, and perhaps I was still a little upset about my toy dinosaurs. Well, during one lunch period, one of my many enemies made the mistake of talking poorly about me in her presence, I kid you not, she took her lunch tray and smacked him clean across the face with it. Because, no one talks about her brother like that... no one but her, that is.

Then came her son, Braydin, and I saw yet another quality in my cruel but loyal sister; Love.

I didn't know she had it in her bones, but I had never seen a love like that and haven't still. Christin spent every moment nurturing and teaching Braydin, he was learning how to read well before he began school. Christin was going to show the world that no matter the circumstances her son was born into , he was going to be intelligent, talented, brave, and full of love. It was during these years with Braydin that we all became aware of just how beautiful Christin could be.

Then came illness and bad decisions.

The final years of my sisters life were an internal battle. One which she often tried to fight alone. We were always there for her, but I would go long stretches without hearing a word and without current contact info, only to get a random phone call asking me for advice or the answer to some obscure question, because, ""You know everything, Nick"".
I didn't- but I sure had her fooled. 

This rising and sinking tide of contact was experienced by all of us close to her in varying degrees. In the end, she had actually begun to let us into her life again. Coming to Christmas, chatting online, telling me that I stunk... But the sickness eventually beat out beautiful, stubborn Christin.

The battle for her is now done. For us, just beginning. She taught us while living and in death, the value of life and its extremes. I sincerely hope that in our own battles we can apply the lessons we've learned from Christins life.

I think it's important to remember Christin as she was, as she truly was.

For her humor as well as her stubbornness, 

her cruelty as well as her love, 

the mistakes she made, 

the joy she brought us, 

and her unending loyalty. 

Because, if we can't find it in our hearts to love anything but the false image of a perfect little angel, then we never really loved Christin at all.
And if we Crosbys, no saints by any measure, who bore the brunt of all her negative and her positive qualities, can love her... 

Then there is none among us who cannot.

I've been working in Telecommunications (DSL, dialup, fiber optics, VoIP, POTS, satellite, radio-link wireless, hosting and domains, others) for around four years, after spending about ten years as a heavy internet user.

That ""cliche"" comment, when you're 21 etc... was me thinking ""Oh, now I feel mean for picking on someone with only 2/3rds my life experience... well, maybe this will help him out somehow..""

You say I should read more. Actually, I've been an avid reader since I was a young boy, stealing my father's Wilbur Smith novels to read after lights-out when I was about 7-8yo. Classmates were just getting into our equivalent of Goosebumps at that age, or maybe later? Anyway, for an 8yo, those were pretty advanced reading. I've progressed, naturally.

Anyway, your arguments have been very focused on drawing attention to the way I lay out my own arguments. You sound like a philosophy student. You also pointed out that I should try philosophy, and continuously talk about reading more- which is closely associated with philosophy.

Hate to break it to you, but it's not a great career choice. Money DOES make you happy- because the lack of it makes life difficult, and that in itself can bring misery. Here's a cruel but funny (and possibly fake) screen-cap regarding just this, that I found on Reddit today.

"c1tp01h","&gt;I love how you try to make spanking a child on a fat covered rear sound like decking them across the face.

I'm not trying to make it sound like. You are causing pain to a child, on purpose. Phrase it however you like to make it seem like you're doing nothing, but that is what you are doing. I do not need to exaggerate. You are physically hurting a child, someone who is defenceless, and it is wrong.

&gt;For some reason you think the only method I use to discipline my daughter is through hitting her? 

No.

&gt;You made a baseless assumption based on a few paragraphs, you're clearly not even mature enough to raise a kid at all much less tell other people how to raise theirs.

What specifically have I said which makes you think I am immature?

Personally I believe someone that can only see the way to parent a child is through hitting them, is immature and cruel.

But for the record, at this stage in my life, I am not mature enough to be a politician, though I can still argue specific points - such as drug legalisation and capital punishment.

&gt;I said that I've spanked my daughter a couple of times at home, and it hasn't been needed anymore because the 'threat' of a spanking is all it takes to calm a tantrum, and somehow you take that to mean that she gets beaten daily.

Where did I say you beat her daily?

Please quote me.

I believe one time is too many. Hitting an adult one time can land you in jail. You don't get let off in my books because it was a one time only.

&gt;Here's a clue: No kid makes it to 5 years old without being bad thousands of times

Damn. Thank you for that revelation.

&gt;if you think I've only had to discipline my daughter twice in 5 years you're either crazy or 16 years old.

Please quote me. I didn't say this. I said it is wrong you physically abuse your child. I did not say how many times you did. Once is wrong.

&gt;She gets disciplined in MANY ways

As will my kids.

&gt;including taking things away, making her go to bed early without dessert or a story, sitting in timeout, or positively reinforced with treats and compliments for doing things good.

Great, as will my kids.

&gt;Maybe once you stop making hugely negative assumptions about people and their lifestyles with no basis behind them

I have basis behind my thoughts - if you hit an average child for misbehaving like an average child does, you are cruel person.

&gt;you will actually be mature enough to raise a kid on your own

How dare you. Seriously, how dare you. You beat your fucking children (I DID NOT SAY REGULARLY) and you have the fucking nerve to tell me that I am not mature because I see this as wrong?

Fuck me I can't believe people like you live in this day and age. Grow the fuck up. There are other options and you are choosing the easy way out through fucking hurting someone that can't hurt you back.

It is fucking cruel.

&gt; until then don't bother trying to tell other people how to raise theirs.

And fuck you again. Would you ever sign a petition for abortions to become fully legalised? Well until you're a woman and in her place don't fucking judge. What sort of fucking stupid ass logic is that?

"c1tjsr8","The funniest anecdotes are always those ""you had to be there"" stories. My brother and I have burst out laughing at something in Super Smash Bros. Melee countless times, but those moments would all be lost if I told them here.

The best I can recall is regarding Minecraft. Personally I can't stand Minecraft, but a couple of my friends bought it and were obsessive about it. One of my friends had wanted to build a fireplace in his wooden house. There's a famous Minecraft video where another guy tries the same thing and burns his house down. My friend assured me that he took the necessary precautions and his house would not burn down. An important thing to note is that, in Minecraft, there are no saves. The game autosaves. You cannot reload an earlier save unless you back it up elsewhere manually. I tell him he will burn his house down, and I'm going to laugh at him. 

He places the fire in the fireplace. All is well. Then the wall catches on fire. And then I start laughing. Hours of work are lost in about 3 minutes, as he futile attempts to douse the fire with buckets of water. In a cruel, twist of fate, this guy already had his house burn down, ** *in real life,* ** a few years before. Cruel, but very funny.

 his guy does not handle weed or alcohol well. At all. If you talk to him while he's high, he'll just continue to sit on the couch, or the floor, and stare into space with a little smile slowly creeping onto his face.

One night we thought it would be a good idea for this guy to play the  Amnesia demo while ludicrously high. He agreed to try. The set-up was perfect. It was about 11:00, lights off, nice big monitor, good computer and solid headphones. The game starts up and the intro cut scene ends. He doesn't move. We assume it's because he's stupidly high and doesn't realize he can move now. Nope. Turns out he's too scared to move. The intro segment with Daniel crawling around was too much for him. We eventually coax him to move. As he plays, he seems to hyperventilate in fear. Somehow, he makes it to ""the water part"". When he lands in the water and hears the splish-splash, he screams and jumps frantically in-circle while shaking the mouse profusely. He barely escapes and the hyperventilating continues.

Eventually, he falls in the water again, screams, and dies. And that's when he gives up on the demo. 

A couple of cool little tidbits:


I played against Shishka from Bungie in Halo 3 matchmaking once. I killed him and promptly teabagged him. =P I saved the film, so I could put it up on my Halo 3 File Share for you to download if you have Halo 3.

Also, I played against Fatal1ty, the most famous pro-FPS player in the world, randomly on Quake Live. He destroyed everyone, but I got a kill off him! =D

My dad would wake me up in the middle of the night by stumbling into my room drunk and yelling at me telling me mom mother is a whore and he's going to kill himself. I lived through that for 6 months before I was able to talk to him about it when he was sober (yes, he was drunk every day for 6 month before I was able to catch him when he woke up sober). He didn't like the fact I was acknowledging his drinking and he kicked me out. Then the phone cals would start at 4 in the morning. I was going to college by this point and nearly dropped out from the lack of sleep. I couldn't turn my phone off because I was afraid I'd miss a phone call from the police telling me my dad killed himself. I wanted to so bad though because he would call me and tell me my mom was a whore and a gold digger. None of this was true, my mom left with the shirt on her back. Overtime, the calls became more frequent untill I was wishing he would drink himself to death, and then I just stopped answering them. Fast forward years later, I'm in therapy and I'm being told it's not my fault or responsibility to look after him and I couldn't agree more. But my mom, who was abused for years is telling me to reconnect with my father. All my family, everyone. I couldn't handle it anymore, because nobody really understood that once my mother left, I took her place as the one being abused. It took a 3 hour phone conversation with my mother and a lot of tears before she understood that I deserved to have my life back, just like she did. I told her how our entire family expects me to talk with my dad despite what he's done because he's my father and he's blood. I told her I didn't care anymore and I don't feel that connection anymore. I mean, I still love him but I'm happier without him. It sounds weird and cruel, but years of abuse tends to make you disconnect. I told my mom that she was able to divorce him, but I couldn't. 

It all worked out in the end. My mom deeply apologized for making me feel this way and she even went out to tell the rest of my family to back off. I love her so much for that. Now I'm happier than ever and a weight has been lifted off my shoulders. I know that when my dad does die, I will feel sad for not talking to him.

"c1os9u9","Over the past 40 years, due to the efforts of first, anti-nuclear groups, and second, environmentalists, within many of the industrial nations, energy has turned from a engineering subject to a political and  engineering subject. Renewables are the most political form of energy, seeing as very few people buy solar PV and wind without politically-granted subsidies.

Energy is still exclusively an engineering subject in much of the world, such as in nations like Korea, Taiwan, China, and India (and this is why they're economically kicking the US's buttocks). By making energy into a political game, we lose the power of rational choice between energy alternatives and instead come to depend on politicized public choice.

In my opinion, politicized public choices are fine and dandy in areas like social welfare, healthcare, and education where the public has competence, and it's far better to be generous and compassionate in these areas in the spirit of mutual aid than allow the rule of cruel but efficient market forces.

However, in an area like energy, the public and NGOs often don't have any engineering competence in making choices that are often highly technical and complicated, and the sway of market forces, the survival of the fittest energy options, are - and ought to be - just the fact of life. That they are not harms US and Western competitiveness in the global economy by raising energy prices, which has driven much manufacturing from the US at least, and prevents us from using the most rational and effective tools to deal with phenomena like global warming.

"c1n9kce","1. Face-to-face interaction depends a lot on subtlety. All of that is lost, there's no body language, no inflections in tone, nothing like that. What is gained is a freedom to express oneself in a remarkably candid way. There's no social barriers to break down, they're already broken. 

2. Well, the obvious fact is that anonymity allows you to be anyone. You can be as false as you please with no repercussions, there's no reputation to be held accountable to. The interesting part of this is that it also allows you to be *more* genuine, because being totally genuine can carry repercussions in the real world. So, since most of us find wearing a mask more troublesome, I think the anonymity of these sites makes us more genuine. The obvious catch to this is that systems like karma can encourage us to pick up the masks once again and conform to an image that everyone else finds pleasing. I'm not a karma guy myself, I'll say whatever I feel like, so at least *I'm* more genuine on reddit than in real life.

3. I don't think we can easily determine the actual type in real life, but we make our own categories. This guy's the dry intellectual, this guy's the colorful literary type, this guy's the cynic, this guy's the meme-spouting no-original-thoughts type, ect. A typical reddit user is a young college student, very impressionable and hasty to judge, and to be honest kind of stupid.

4. I think of course that social formalities will weaken. However, they shouldn't end up disappearing completely. As for socializing itself, I think that reddit doesn't really represent the future but just an aspect of it. I believe that the idea of ""this is how you socialize"" will weaken. Nobody will really be making such a distinction between real friends and internet friends. Because it's all real, and especially as we get more and more sophisticated methods of interacting over the net, it will become more and more possible to etch out a meaningful life virtually. I guess what I'm saying that most people will have several modes of socializing, from the fully anonymous social network (4chan) to the non-anonymous social network (facebook), from virtual (second life) to text (reddit). 

5. It's definitely making us lazy know-it-alls. Opinions become qualified for a good reason, and that is because the person worked his ass off to become an expert in his field.

"c1jvtxz","It’s interesting I agree with most of what you are saying but I label myself pro-choice instead.

We will probably need to define ""abortion as birth control"" - do you mean people who don't use birth control and just think ""oh hey, I can get an abortion"" or people who have used birth control which failed and then use abortion as the back up?

The former is rare. It is used as a dramatic case example in people’s moral entrepreneurial campaigns against abortion. I'm not saying there isn't anyone out there like that but those women are few and far between. Even if there are women who may view abortion like that doesn't mean their misuse of those services should limit the rights of everyone else. There are some people who use alcohol irresponsibly and kill people who driving or find themselves in a mess of addiction but everyone else's right to drink is not inhibited because of them. 

I agree with the opt-in idea, there are so many irresponsible parents that really, there should be a test you have to take before you can have a child. Of course that is unrealistic, not everyone may agree what good parenting is and that is just simply cruel. But the idea sounds ideal.

&gt;birth control that had previously made it impossible to get pregnant

I think you may have a misconception about birth control. Even when used correctly there is only a 99.9% chance you won't get pregnant. Those odds are good but there will still be someone who used it correctly and who will get pregnant. Should those people still be forced to carry out the pregnancy? Anyway it’s stupid to think that someone wants to have an abortion or even wants to make the decision regarding an abortion. No one wants to make the decision but sometimes we have to.

&gt;When it comes down to it, I think people are making the decision (having control over that) when they have sex that they might get pregnant

Yes, there may be a risk of getting pregnant but that's why we have services that help lower that risk, that allow a woman not to be forced into such a limiting biological state. You may also argue that if she doesn't want to get pregnant she should just not have sex. Forcing a biological creature to not have sex is unrealistic and cruel. Sex is a natural, healthy thing and being forced not to have sex is inhumane. Plus if you tell a woman she cannot have sex unless she wants to get pregnant pushes women back 100 years. It was said in that article in a capitalist society – women will never be free or equal until they have the means to make a choice about what direction their biology will go. If they don’t have that choice then women are simply baby-making machines or told we cannot participate in certain activities because we have these specific reproductive capabilities meaning simply because we are women.  

You may argue - well that's a woman's biology and she needs to get used to it. Pregnancy is debilitating. It wreaks havoc on your body. Forcing someone to go through that process if they don't want to is inhumane. Not only the effects on your body, the risk of death from giving birth, and just the effect on your life. That is a life changing decision, even if one decides to give their child up for adoption the costs of nutrition, birthing classes, hospital bills, time off work is completely unrealistic for many lower socioeconomic citizens. 

&gt;we don't know when life happens

You’re right, and we will never know and that argument will never end. I personally believe an embryo is not a human being. It is a cell that is dividing, it does not have consciousness, it is not human. It is the precursor to human life but it is not human itself. So because we have different beliefs – should my beliefs be denied because you happen to disagree with me? 

&gt; I would never, ever have an abortion, and I don't think anyone should

And that’s good for you, but because you can make that decision doesn’t mean someone else can and that doesn’t mean you should expect that of someone else. And because someone may choose to have an abortion doesn’t make them a bad person either. We are all different, we are all at different stages in our lives and there is no blanket rule “abortion is good, abortion is bad” – all of these situations are so variable.  You are not affected by someone’s decision to have a child or not, so it is none of your business. That is a very very personal decision for someone to make and some random person in the country should not have a say in that. 

If you are against abortion you need to realize *it will never end*. There will always be people seeking abortions. If you want to lower the abortion rate then here’s what you do:
-provide proper sexual health education to all (not abstinence only, that’s fucking stupid)
-provide free birth control to all
-provide sexual health services to all (this includes all pregnancy classes, hospital bills etc.)
-provide lower socioeconomic services so that people who cannot afford a child now may have the means to through these programs

It’s interesting many who want to illegalize abortion also want to reduce funding to these services. It is very counter-intuitive; they are indirectly encouraging people to get abortions because they won’t be able to afford the child otherwise. You mention this forum/article was a big circle jerk – but guess what this issue is very real to many women and there are people with very extreme views on abortion. Those rights and services are in jeopardy. It’s scary as hell – I know I’m terrified.

"c1gd0j0","&gt;There was nothing wrong with my example's coherence

Examples aren't definitions. If I ask you to define ""fruit,"" and you say ""an apple is a fruit,"" you have given me an example of a fruit but you haven't defined it. 

First you said ""cruel"" meant something that was done **solely** for the purpose of causing pain or discomfort. That would obviously mean that torture is not cruel, since torture may be done to extract information.

Then you said ""When you go out of your way to cause someone discomfort that's cruel,"" but all punishment involves going out of your way to cause someone discomfort - prisons don't build themselves, you have to go out of your way to arrest people and put them in prison - so under that definition the 8th amendment is a tautology, since all punishment would be ""cruel.""


Now you're saying that cruelty ""would be going beyond what's necessary,"" but how do you know what's necessary? Maybe prison isn't necessary. Maybe we could just put people under house arrest. If that were true, would that make it unconstitutional to put people in prison? 

Or is necessity somehow linked to the underlying offense, such that punishment deemed ""necessary"" for a serial killer (prison) would be unconstitutional for Bernie Madoff because it is not strictly necessary to put him in prison?

And of course I'm setting aside the fact that the Constitution forbids punishment that is ""cruel AND unusual,"" not ""cruel OR unusual."" So under a plain reading of the Constitution,  a punishment that is simply cruel would not be unconstitutional. It would have to be both cruel and unusual. Under a plain reading of constitution, torture would not be unconstitutional if it were usual, even though it might be cruel.

&gt;It specifically says in the first amendment, ""or the right of the people peaceably to assemble,

"c1g8kcl","As a rape survivor: Talk to her about sex, during sex, all the time. Ask her what she likes, encourage her to be vocal. If she doesn't like something, she needs to tell you or else things are going to go downhill, she's going to avoid sex, and you'll feel bad for bringing it up. It's a big ol' mess that easy to fix by communication.

I'd never been with anyone before my rape- and it was rather brutal, multiple men involved, I was unfortunately sober and very aware, and I fought a lot. Luckily, I'm with a great guy now [who I consider my first] and due to our awesome communication, we have a great sex life. At first sex was painful because of scar tissue, and often I would bleed [even with lube, even when i was ready] After a month of painful sex, and bad memories I tried to just... get around having sex... my poor boyfriend, I'm so glad he didn't dump me. haha. [love you, babe]. but seriously, once we started talking about it, and I communicated what I liked and didn't like things got so much better.

This gets personal, so forgive the blunt-ness: before I was raped I had rape-fantasies- nothing crazy and cruel, but like sexy fantasies where I would be whisked away because a ridiculously man found me too irrisistable [you know, romance novel stuff]. BUT- after I was raped, I still had them and seriously thought I was all kind of fucked up. I'd been severely injured, used, and I felt just... I can't even describe it. Absolutely worthless. Unattractive. Just, terrible. And yet when I 'got over it' and started thinking about sex/masturbation again I was still turned on by my fantasies. It sickened myself, and I seriously thought I was insane. I questioned whether I was just trying to cope, or what... and through councilling learned that a rape fantasy is nothing like a rape, because you control your fantasies. Another way to equate it is: Say you like steak. And then you got food poisoning from a bad steak... after you're better, you would continue to eat steak, right? Steak is delicious, and one silly food poisoning isn't going to fuck up your adoration of steak. That's how the fantasies were.'

I'm not saying that this is the case for her- but it can be equated to a lot of things in sex, whether it's rough sex, or whatever she digs. Rape affects how you think about sex. One girl I know was raped while wearing stockings, and the rapist commented on thembeing sexy, so she didn't wear them for years- even when her husband asked because she equated it to rape.

Anyways, i've rambled enough. If you have *any* questions, feel free to ask me. I'm to the point to where I don't really think about my rape because it has so little consequence in my life. Why would I let the worst thing that ever happened to me determine the best thing that ever happened to me [and if you were able to have multiple orgasms, you'd know the answer to that. ;)] I really only think about it in posts like this, or when I'm working with love146.

You can justify insulting anyone or anything you wish, even though there are no goals to achieve in doing so except pure entertainment for you.

I have no wish to insult any individual or group. I'm sorry if you received that impression. 

And calling me amoral is not going to win you any points.

&gt; What a pathetic world view. You're basically saying that poorer countries are inferior because they don't have technology or they lack institutionalized education. Go to the tribes in West Africa and see if you still share that same world view.

They are inferior technologically and educationally yes. This is not a controversial point to make. 

And it is quite true that a correlation exists between the level of technology and education a country has with the level of acceptance of others it practices. 

&gt; Why are atheists offended by something they don't even believe in? Christians tell Muslims all the time that we are going to hell. I don't find that offensive or insulting at all.

But I do. And you serve to illustrate my point perfectly. Different things will offend different people. If we were to outlaw everything that causes someone offence then nothing would be left. In a free society you must accept that you do not have a right to not be offended. 

&gt; Committing blasphemy is not criticism, which is why this discussion was first started. It's an aggressive act of arrogance.

I don't find it to be an ""aggressive act of arrogance"" in the same way that you don't find Christians telling you that you're going to Hell offensive. Do you understand? 

&gt; Yes, but God didn't say that. Straw man.

This is no straw man because I clearly said ""If"". It is a hypothetical. You say that God determines your morality. So what would you do if God told you to steal as much as you could? Or what if God told you to kill a family member like he told Abraham to kill his son? Would you go through with it?

&gt; Once again, completely proving my point that anti-theists can justify any action as morally correct in any way they want. If it ""feels"" right, then do it.

I am an atheist who thinks that adultery is dishonest and cruel but it is not a crime. There should not be a punishment other then the breaking of a marriage contract and favourable court treatment to the spouse who did not break the contract. There is no credible rationalization for anything more then that.

&gt;  Nonetheless, you failed to give an adequate response to how a non-religious moral code can be standardized.

Why should it be standardized? Morality is not black and white. It's countless shades of grey. 

&gt; I guess that's the only way you can live a guilt-free lifestyle.

I feel no guilt when I criticize religion in the same way that you feel no guilt when you criticize gay marriage. It seems like we're both living a ""guilt-free lifestyle"".

"c1ejy36","Exactly. People who only know him from the Lord of the Rings don't know his whole story. It helps to know the history of Middle Earth (warning to Tolkein nerds: heavily dumbed-down and paraphrased):

* Gandalf is Olorin, a Maiar who has been around since *the beginning of time*. He came to Arda (the physical world, which includes the continent known as Middle Earth) with the other gods. That's about as old as you can get (hard to quantify exactly, but certainly tens of thousands of years).

* Gandalf's boss is Manwe, the king of the gods that live in Arda. However, long before the events of LoTR, the gods stopped directly intervening in the affairs of mortals. Basically they sit up in heaven and don't give a shit about the little people.

* Sauron is also a divine being of equal stature (if greater physical power) to Gandalf. Long ago, the gods beat the crap out of Sauron's boss, Morgoth, who was basically the root of all evil, and kicked him out of the universe (I'm paraphrasing here). But after that, they were so sick of fighting evil and dealing with mortals (who were easily corrupted by evil), that they they packed up their continent and literally lifted it off the face of the planet.

* This left Sauron alone, unchecked, to mess with the poor mortals in Middle Earth. Kind of like leaving a pedophile alone in a day care.

* Eventually Manwe felt sorry for the poor bastards and chose a couple of Maiar to go to Middle Earth and give the mortals a fighting chance. They were known as the Wizards. That's pretty much the only rope the mortals ever got from Manwe, and the other gods continued to live in heaven not giving a shit. This all happened relatively recently, about 3,000 years before LoTR.

* Manwe knew that Sauron was really strong and would likely corrupt even his Wizards, so he told Gandalf to lay low and hide his power, even from the other Wizards. He made Sauruman the leader, but he knew the whole time that Gandalf was the wisest.

* The Wizards' mission was to stay hidden, helping the mortals as best they could, but never try and fight Sauron head on. It was a game of finesse, helping the mortals resist Sauron, but staying hidden, without giving in to the temptations of power and trying to rule over them. 

* Gandalf was a master at it. The other Wizards failed miserably.

* Sauruman failed long before he was corrupted by the Palantir. He gave in to the temptation to rule. He built a kingdom in Isengard and gathered his own power, instead of helping the mortals.

* Radagast failed in the opposite way. He removed himself from civilization, caring only about plants and animals, and stopped caring about the mortals.

* The other Wizards went off to the East and were never heard from again. Tolkein didn't write much about them, but it's generally assumed that they didn't amount to much.

* Gandalf, like a boss, spent 3,000 years tirelessly helping the mortals. Even when they hated him and cursed him and blamed him for evil happenings, he was helping them in some way that they didn't understand. Despite his tremendous power and influence, he never had a home, he never made a kingdom. He left his sweet gig in *heaven* and lived in Middle Earth like a hobo for millennia, never wavering from his mission even after all his teammates failed. That's pretty badass in my book.

An example can be seen in The Hobbit: 

* Gandalf is a master manipulator. He knew that a war was coming with Sauron. It was inevitable. He knew that if Sauron had a dragon on his side, it could do some real damage. He needed to take Smaug out of the equation before the real war started.

* Gandalf organized the mission to Erebor and let the Dwarves think that they were getting their kingdom back. But really it was a two-fold mission. 

* One, the dwarves would be motivated by greed to fight the dragon before he could rejoin Sauron's forces. Gandalf knew that the dwarves would do almost anything to get their kingdom and their treasure back, even at terrible cost to themselves. This seems cold and cruel, but that's the kind of choices Gandalf had to make. He knew that fighting a dragon alone and unguided would ultimately be less costly than fighting it as part of Sauron's organized war effort.

* Two, the entire mission was a cover so Gandalf could recon Sauron's base in Mirkwood without being detected. Dude is a chessmaster.

* And of course all the awesome stuff he does in LoTR, which everyone already knows about ...

"c1eefaw","&gt; I didn't. It isn't ""supposed"" to look like anything in particular. However there's a range of possible environments which comfortably sustain human life and a much larger range beyond which makes human life hell, or impossible. Given the vast array of services the global ecosystem provides humanity absolutely free, it's in our interest to at least think it over before we start playing Jenga with the ecological building blocks.

We *are* thinking it over, look at the discussion about global warming. That doesn't need to happen, but it does. There is zero reason to stop having kids now. Do you have no idea how human minds work? We are going to find a solution as soon as it is absolutely needed. Not sooner, not later. Have a little faith, it wouldn't be baseless.

&gt; Say I adopt a child who is about to fall through the cracks of the social system. In doing this I accomplish everything producing a child would accomplish except for putting an additional hungry mouth on the planet and spreading my oh-so-important genes (don't glorify)

But your genes are important. Who are you to think to know better than millions of years of evolution? Don't fuck with evolution, there is a reason why you are surviving and others are not. This may sound cruel, but other countries and unfortunate people have to figure their shit out alone. We can't fix everything for them, drop the american police mentality.

&gt; You really find the social gains here to be irrelevant to the original question?

It's fine that you wan't to adopt. But there is no reason why that would be any better than getting your own kid and there may be a lot of hidden evolutionary reasons to have your own kid. (maybe you have less congenital diseases etc. Maybe less allergies. Maybe more. It doesn't matter, the point is that nature/evolution is going to figure it out just fine without you.)
Societal advantages are tiny, and you are not solving anything. Where that unfortunate kid came from, there will be alot more of those produced. 

&gt; Why not someone else's children? There will be plenty. **There will always be plenty**.

That's exactly the reason why not. You are not solving anything and messing with evolution in the process. You are messing with society to. Who are you to decide which kid should live or die? And besides, adoption is not such an easy process, I hear that it sometimes takes a decade after application to get a child that way. You are taking away that opportunity from parents  who can't naturally have kids.
Just because there are a lot of poor people around the world, doesn't mean that you can just take one of those children. Most have no adoption programs, you can't just go over there and take a kid.

Now apparently the man in this picture is ""evil"" because he is well-fed yet refuses to share food with a starving child.

You original claim was that ""California has always imprisoned its citizens at almost twice the **rate** of other states"", which I have proven is not the case.   
It is not surprising that the state with the largest population should have the largest prison population aswell, in absolute numbers. But if we are to compare the states to each other we have to use proportions.

I'm not sure I quite understand your position; you seemd to start out by claiming California was the worst amongst states because so much of its population was ""imprisoned, detained, harassed and committed"". But now you seems to be saying that California isn't treating felons and probation-violators harshly enough. I'm a little confused.

I can only attempt to guide you towards the relevant information:

California has a population of ca. 37,300,000, Texas has a population of ca 25,200,000. This amounts to about 12% and 8%, respectively, of the total [U.S. population](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_states_by_population). California thus has about 3/2 the citizens of Texas, and if all other factors are assumed equal, we should expect to see this relationship hold true for all other population-based metrics.

This is not the case. Texas has a far higher relative incarceration rate, while California is below the country average. For obvious reasons California normally has a higher absolute number of prisoners than Texas, as expected, but at the beginning of 2010 Texas had gained the coveted position of Number 1. Calif. **169,413** and Texas **171,249**. [Se the report](http://www.pewcenteronthestates.org/uploadedFiles/Prison_Count_2010.pdf?n=880). 

I can't find a source for the claim that ""currently they are not sending felons back to prison for absconding or violating their parole because there simply isn't enough room"". Do you have a reference for me?

I did find several references to California's prison system being overcrowded, and attempts at solving this by shortening sentences for *misdemeanors*, not felonies, a policy that doesn't appear very controversial. [See this](http://articles.ocregister.com/2010-02-17/crime/24628624_1_inmates-probation-jail).

[Marsy's Law](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marsy%27s_Law) and [Californian three strikes laws](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Strikes_Law#Effects_in_California) would seem to point towards a harsh sentencing climate, but **still** they have fewer inmates than Texas.

I am not defending California, clearly their prison systems is flawed and often cruel, but I am defending the truth. You do not get to choose your own facts just because it *feels right*. You will be corrected.

And there was a scrap of food on the floor, and two of them scrambled for the food, pushing each other out of the way, while the Nazis looked on and laughed at them. But another marcher/victim looked on as well, and turned to the laughing guards and said ""you did this, one day you'll pay for what you've done""...

Can you feel guilty *for* feeling guilty? Better consider that, and have a conscience with a conscience, as that is the only kind of conscience you have any right to, well, conscience. No lie. 

Guilt is the mechanism of homophobia in the first place, i.e., someone is supposedly ""stooping low"", as you put it, to have sex with another of the same sex rather than the ""proper"" partner, or stooping low to have that ""gay mannerism of the gay""...that might seem a little far-fetched to you, but I don't think so. The greatest true responsibility ultimately is going to lie with what is premeditated, richly planned, artifactive and founded in comfort and superiority, not the kid who, maybe gay himself, lashes out under the overall stress of such a world, such an economy, and certainly not the one who, blurry eyed, staggered from his home where who knows what went on, after the strange phone calls, wondered who would call him a fag today. Ultimately you may have been in the same situation. The truest guilt will remain with those who coordinate, master, ring the phone lines, so to speak, in richly premeditated malice that is itself the guilt trip par excellence. That kind of violence may be forgivable, but it is on another level, and when you feel too guilty, you actually fuel it, oddly enough.

You have a big heart, but there are layers of responsibility for the situation of homophobia. Ultimately your guilt, like the ""guilt"" of gays for ""choosing to be gay"", has to be questioned as you question yourself when you ask ""why""?"", and that means questioning what we think of as conscience.

The point is there is very rarely anything you can do. Unless he decides to change, anything you do isn't going to have a very large affect. You can try, but if he abuses your trust and refuses your help, don't invest your life and money continuing to try to help him. Be there if he decides to change, but don't keep trying to force him to change.

If you want to pay for therapy, excellent. Don't give him the money. Pay for it directly. Rehab? Same thing. Don't trust him.

Or you could give into their dirty desires: ""Tell me more about my ass"", ""You're cute when you're angry"", and ""hah great insult!""

There are only so many dick and mother jokes, so if you're looking for something alternative, play into their silly games.  But these usually put a stop to insulting back and forth, and most people enjoy the Lisa-Lampinelli-approach.

As always, if you're insulting in person, go for as personal as possible:  Nancy boy plays lacrosse?  Ask him why he couldn't make the baseball team; A real man's sport would never involve shorts; You do realize that's french, right? etc.  Is he shorter than you?  Little man syndrome is hilarious in midgets: Look for stepladders or bend at the knee when it speaks.  Pat the head, but be careful for the suckerpunch.  Adding ""When you grow up..."" talking in your best advice-dad voice will probably put him over the edge.

Nationalities are cruel, but effective.  Use only when you're opponent fires first.  Is he of Middle-Eastern descent?  Forget it, they smell like curry so get the fuck out of there.  Mexican?  Tell him to duck down, and scream ""La Migra!"" while you frantically look around the room.  Due to his illiteracy, slowly enunciate your insults, and try to incorporate words he would understand, like ""taco"" and ""welfare.""  AVOID BLACK HUMOR.  White people don't really care about race jokes...except if they're southern.  Tell him his insults crash and burn...like Earnhardt.  Sing the ""deliverance"" theme and ask him if he thinks paved roads are overrated.  Is dysentery a significant problem; how was he able to forge the river on the way here?  Jews and Asians (I'm sorry) are pretty easy targets, so I wouldn't even try.  But it's important to generalize!
  
What does he look like?  Hook-noses look like beaks, or eagles (is he endangered?  how do you catch mice?).  Pointy noses look like rats (Wow, Kobe, I thought we'd never meet!)(I loved you in ""Williard"").  Big noses are easy.  Most frat kids are balding--remind him of the his receding hairline and the amazing success of pedophiles.  He probably has a nice car if that's the case.  Look for deformities.  Lazy eyes are hilarious!  Ask him to repeat his insult but to look at you in the eyes when he does it.  Repeat.  Jowls are great, too, if you have a good Droopy impression.  Protruding forehead? Lighten up, stop looking so serious all the time!  Tell him you remember visiting his relatives on easter island.

"c1915fg","I've recently started reading books from military reading lists, sort of an academic excursion into the motives and goals of this generation of American soldiers and officers. Given the circumstances of my reading, my comment wont be about the quality of the stories, and more about the extent of their impact.

I digress, allow me to get to the topic at hand. I finished Ender's Game recently (For those who were not aware, yes, Ender's Game is on a couple armed forces reading lists) and it's impact on the military is crystal clear, specifically in the area of recruiting. Get at them young; accept only the best; pit them against each other; give them nigh-impossible tasks while undermining their ability to complete those tasks. Propagandize, lie, cheat, and most importantly, sacrifice anything if it will guarantee victory.

One might argue these are traits that have bolstered armies (plagued might be better) since the concept of organized battle was first envisioned. The trouble is, discounting Ancient Sparta (which was cruel but seemingly honest about it), the only examples that match a system akin to Ender's Game are not very pleasant examples. One would be North Korea, another Nazi Germany, and, of course, the U.S. of A.

O.S.C. lays out a perfect road map for a systematic conversion of the entire Earth into something like fuel for a war machine; one that, for all we know, has no real enemy to fight. Over the last few decades of the last century there's been a lack of a catalyst for such a transformation, but we now have 9/11 and the ""War on Terrorism"" to fill the niche.

It's important to note, in my reading of Ender's Game, Ender is the least important part of the story. He's the Mary Sue to drag you along while Card whispers doom in your ear.

When I deal with families, for the most part all they want to do is tell their story. They don't want my advice they just want to talk. So many times I will spend 5-10 minutes with them and at the end of it they just say ""thank you for listening."" Then they see another friend and spend the next 5 minutes telling the same story.

Just be a friend and no more. If people want a grief counselor they will find one or professional help if they feel they need it. If somebody says, ""I have been stuck like this for six months."" Do not come up with some brilliant plan or anything just be honest, say something like, ""I will be honest, I really do not know what to tell you but if you want to talk to a professional who would better understand you maybe I could help you find somebody.""

"c14lqtx","Thank you. I'm just a bit fed up with the naysayers with nothing to offer in place of the objectionable ideas. I would first and foremost like to see drugs legalized. Unfortunately a majority of the population doesn't want that to happen. After 70 years of failed education programs I see little hope of legalization happening for at least another 70 years and at the current rate, never. The killings in Mexico will continue, the gangs will continue to make billions and get richer and more powerful. Sooner or later this is going to spill over into the US full bore. When the gangs get powerful enough they will buy the police (which has already happened at many border crossing and in many towns including mine), the politicians (which has probably already happened) and we will be at their mercy. The sooner we take the power away from the cartels the better chance we have of maintaining control of our government and our country. 

Let me give you an example of just how bad it really is. Today my husband called me from work. He's a school teacher in a high school on an Indian Reservation in Minnesota. The Tribal Chairman came out publicly last week that he was the leader of the local chapter of the Bloods street gang. The Tribal Chairman is insisting that the school allow student to wear their gang colors to school. The parents, mostly gang members too are backing him and had their kids walk out of school today. The rival Native Mob is up in arms and has vowed to kill Bloods if they wear their colors to school. Three people were shot, one died yesterday in this ongoing gang war. Last week 85+ kids were involved in a running gang fight stretching half way across the town.

I used to live right next door to one of many crack houses in this town. Once a month a tribal cop car would stop in at the crack shack and the cop would go inside for about 20-30 minutes and then come back out and drive away. Why? He was picking up the protection money. 

That house got shot to hell when someone got pissed off and opened fire with an AK-47. One dead, 3 in the hospital, one paralyzed for life. 

Our neighborhood has been taken over by the gangs already. Meth, pot, heroin, crack, acid and guns are making them a fortune. The gang has control of the Reservation. Soon they will be running your town. The killing is already happening here. In 2005 we had a 1% murder rate. Yes, 1 out of every 100 people in this town was killed, all in gang violence for control of the illegal drug market. One of those killed was dismembered alive, eyes gouged out, body parts cut off, all less than one mile from my home. It's not just Mexico, it's already here. If it takes a bloodbath for people to stand up and say enough is enough, so be it. I've already seen enough blood, the rest of the country needs to see what is happening and be dragged out of their safe little suburban cocoon. Yea, it sounds cold and cruel but that's life and death in the gang world. I don't want to live in a gang controlled world. Legalize, tax, control, by whatever means is necessary. It's the only way to rid us of this hideous and dangerous black market. 

I hope I didn't waste too much of your time. I'll think about you the next time someone gets killed in this gang war raging all around me. ",1288985445,"yea, it sounds cold and cruel but that's life and death in the gang world.","cold and cruel","cruel",NA,FALSE,"cold and cruel","cold",NA,NA,0

There are engagements where Dawkins' unwillingness to give an inch for the sake of sensitivity is a great boon.  However, it can also be a liability in other situations.  

I used to really think people like Lawrence Krauss were asshole fence-sitters who wanted to pussy foot around things.  To a degree I even felt this way about Harris.  Now, even though I love the ""conversational intolerance"" idea, I think it wouldn't be right in most situations.

When you directly insult people they go on lockdown and get defensive.  They will vilify you and hold to their preconceived notions of how cruel and fundamentalist atheists are.  However, if they can see you as a person and realize that you each share similar challenges in different arenas, they can come to at least respect your position.


The big problem isn't Dawkins.  He is strident as a result of various factor, many of which probably have to do with insulation from average religious people.  He's not trying to be cruel.  But many atheists, and notably some here on reddit, are out just to be belligerent.  I know it's not popular to call these types out and like any other time I've mentioned it, there will be a hail of downvotes in backlash because I'm ""too soft"" on theism.  Sadly though, it's true.  

Too many people want to identify with atheism for the -ism part.  They make it a tribal us vs. them, and while we do have a battle, we're gonna lose if we simply attach to a label and become part of a hateful mob of anti-religious people with the zeal of those who are religious.  You make yourself easy targets when you do it.  Westboro doesn't respresent all of Christianity and bitter atheists don't represent all atheists.

"c0yhefr","Humans are evolved to be omnivores.

I find most vegetarians and especially vegans really have very little understanding of how the natural world actually works.  It's not very nice.  Compared to the way we kill animals, their death in the wild is generally agonizing and protracted.  A bear for instance will eat a goat by first breaking its spine so it can't run away, then consume it while it's still alive.  Starting with the udders and entrails.  Even if an animal doesn't get eaten by something else, it will eventually sicken and die.  A blow to the head with an air hammer comparatively speaking is merciful.

It's also a myth that world wide vegetarianism would kill fewer animals.  If everyone went vegetarian we would have to convert larger amounts of land to agricultural production, destroying countless burrowing creatures habitats.  Also, not all land can be used productively for agriculture but can be used for grazing animals.  Rocky grasslands for example - great for goats, crap for crops.  Therefore, if we gave up meat eating that land would go unused, creating a need for even greater intensity in agricultural production in other areas.

At the same time, I understand the outrage at factory farms.  There are ways to have intense meat production in ways that aren't environmentally disastrous and cruel, but factory farms are run by monopoly corporations that only give a shit about profits.  That's the thing to get pissed about - the corporate control of our food supply.

"c0yfp0r","Hmm... I'm open to the possibility but I don't think that I was anthropomorphising as such. I certainly agree that the part you quoted is a massive exaggeration though!

I read an article recently about dog psychology which explained why punishing a dog after the fact for unwanted behaviour is not only cruel but ineffective. It seems they fond that dogs do not have a linear perception of time but rather a 'set of snapshots' that they refer back to when needed. So they remember scenes (like chewing your running shoes) and they remember your reaction (freaking out, ""bad dog"", sending him outside for an hour) but they lack the ability to tie the two together in terms of one causingthe other.

This is why positive affirmation is so effective, it makes your reaction *part of the scene the remember* which is clearly the way to go.

Why I mention this is that it illustrates that dogs certainy do remember what we call 'the past' although they do not see it as we do (a chain of linked events) but this does not mean that they are incapable of perceiving last events, reacting to them emotionally (lead is out! Walks are awesome!) and acting on them.

Sure, dogs most likely do not lie in the sun askig themselves why we're here nor do they sit on benches in parks contemplating the deeper meanings of the deeper meanings but to say that they only focus on what is happening in the moment reduces the richness of how they actually do fucntion.

It could be argued that people only focus on the present even if what they are presently doing is focusing on the past... That kind of isn't a fair comment though and that, I guess is why I disagree with epicgeek on this one.

Been a long while, historically, that monogamy has been part of the definition of moral. If you weren't monogamous, you were cheating, or ""living in sin"", and people would even try to force the word ""cheating"" onto a *mutually voluntary* open relationship (Cf: bigamy laws).

Again, you have to prove that He could have. As I said previously, you seem to supose a lot about what a being like God is able to do. What standard are you holding God against so you can grade His actions?

&gt; If we're allowed a free range of action, then sooner or later someone will engage in action that is not approved.

My problem with your argument is not a matter of possibility, but that you affirm necessity. There is no *will* engage. There is a real permanent likelihood that someone engages in sinful behavior, but there is no *will* engage. The probability does not approach 1 as the time passes. You are arguing from a mathematical fallacy called ""[Law of Averages](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_averages)."" My disagreement comes from your unwarranted implied *necessity*.

&gt; What the Bible was written in is not relevant to what the term ""omniscience"" means. The term, which was developed to more efficiently describe an aspect of God's nature

I agree that it is irrelevant to what the term omniscience means. I disagree that the term 'more efficiently describe' an aspect of God's nature, since it disagrees with the Bible's description of said nature.

&gt; Looking back, I don't see those verses. 

[They're here](http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAChristian/comments/cy9j4/why_doesnt_god_just_destroy_satan_and_restore/c0wcxpt).

&gt; it doesn't reconcile the tradition of prophecy in the Bible, since the Bible is filled with events predicted to come true that would violate free will, if planned.

And how would they *not* violate free will if ""predicted?""

&gt; God plans wars and earthquakes? Because his prophecies include those. God plans people to take specific actions? Because his prophecies include those, too. Either we have free will, or God micromanages our fates which you claim above doesn't happen.

False Dilemma. You want either absolute free will or absolute micromanagement. I argue for a middle position where God micromanages only when strictly necessary.

&gt; The only alternative is that God sees what is to come and plans accordingly.

I disagree that this is the only alternative. I offered another above, but I have a question. Plans accordingly to cause it to happen, or plans accordingly to react to that, and prevent it?

&gt; So you deny the Christian dogma of the Trinity.

Yes.

&gt; How could he know him well enough to know he would be interrogated three times? How could he know him well enough to know he would be interrogated three times before a rooster could crow three times?

I believe you mean ""before a rooster could crow two times,"" but the fact is that he didn't have to. He only needed to withold the rooster until he did it three times. Remember that Peter only left after he heard the rooster and saw Jesus. What if he remained? Would he had not denied Christ a fourth time?

&gt; The more plausible explanation (for the sake of argument that it happened at all) is that God/Jesus/whoever knew the future rather than dictated the future.

By ""knewing"" the future, they already violate free will. If they already ""knew"" that Peter would deny Christ three times, could Peter have not done it? If you say no, Peter no longer has free will. If you say yes, God is no longer infallible.",1281550038,"&gt; my argument isn't that god couldn't set the rules so that the impact wasn't so devastating and inhumanely cruel, but that he chose not to even though he could have.","cruel, but that","cruel","but",TRUE,"so devastating and inhumanely cruel","devastating","inhumanely","so",0
"c0wif9b","&gt; This is true, but nowhere in the Christian dogma it says that God is omnipotent and controls everything in its finest details. A being can be omnipotent and refrain from using his power freely, and use it with discretion instead.

Ah, I think I see the disconnect here.  My argument isn't that God *couldn't* set the rules so that the impact wasn't so devastating and inhumanely cruel, but that he chose not to *even though he could have*.

&gt; Your argument does not follow. You have yet to prove that free will will ultimately result in sin. Free will can result in sin, but not necessarily will result in sin. If you want to use it as one of your premises, you must provide reasons for you to believe so.

I've addressed this repeatedly, and you've ignored it.  If we're allowed a free range of action, then sooner or later someone *will* engage in action that is not approved.  This principle holds true in nature, mathematics, physics and so forth:  it's called a statistical bell curve.  We see it constantly in human behavior.  God, having created humanity with free will, and being omniscient therefore knowing the full potential of free will, couldn't help but know that sooner or later free will would bring mankind to sin.  Just our luck (dogmatically convenient, in fact) that it happened right away at the beginning of our history.

&gt; The Bible was not written in vulgar Latin, either. Claiming that you are right because the term correctly derives from vulgar Latin is moot. Is it a correct derivation from the words used in Hebrew and Greek, the languages the Bible was originally written?

What the Bible was written in is not relevant to what the term ""omniscience"" means.  The term, which was developed to more efficiently describe an aspect of God's nature, is derived from a phrase in Latin (vulgar, according to the etymology I saw).  They found a word that better described what they were talking about and used it.  The fact that they didn't have it in Greek or Hebrew simply means they hadn't thought of it.

&gt; And I added FIVE more verses that support my position, just in case you forgot. So, according to my counting, even if I were to concede that the four verses you provided actually support your position, and the first two don't, so I don't know where you got this idea that I am relying on a single passage to support my position. It is five against four to my advantage, so far.

Looking back, I don't see those verses.  And it doesn't reconcile the tradition of *prophecy* in the Bible, since the Bible is filled with events predicted to come true that would violate free will if planned.

&gt; No, it doesn't. God's plans always succeed. There is no suposition implied anywhere.

Says you.  Simply saying ""no it isn't"" isn't an argument.  God plans wars and earthquakes?  Because his prophecies include those.  God plans people to take specific actions?  Because his prophecies include those, too.  Either we have free will, or God micromanages our fates which you claim above doesn't happen.  The only alternative is that God sees what is to come and plans accordingly.

&gt; Neither. First, who said that was Jesus. Jesus is not Jehovah, Jesus is not the Father. Jesus doesn't make prophecies, unless He is repeating what the Father told him to say. He said it himself, more than once.

So you deny the Christian dogma of the Trinity.  In other words, you represent an offshoot cult of Christianity that doesn't agree with the majority.

&gt; Jesus knew Peter well enough. They spent over three years together, nearly all the time. Jesus knew Peter, and knew that he would fold under pressure. There is no prediction needed here.

So Jesus knew Peter well enough to know he would deny him.  How could he know him well enough to know he would be interrogated three times?  How could he know him well enough to know he would be interrogated three times before a rooster could crow three times?

&gt; If any violation of free will happened here, it was God witholding the roosters' second crow until Peter folded three times.

That's a really, really long stretch.  God and Jesus are jumping through multiple hurdles to thread together an extremely improbable series of events without somehow violating free will.  The more plausible explanation (for the sake of argument that it happened at all) is that God/Jesus/whoever knew the future rather than dictated the future.",1281537973,"my argument isn't that god *couldn't* set the rules so that the impact wasn't so devastating and inhumanely cruel, but that he chose not to *even though he could have*.    &gt; your argument does not follow.","cruel, but that","cruel","but",TRUE,"so devastating and inhumanely cruel","devastating","inhumanely","so",0

Just lol. Really Im laughing out loud. If we were here ""millions of years"" and this is as far as we could get, arguing through some phones lines, then we are pretty stupid then huh.

&gt;Natural selection is cruel, but effective, and I am the result of it.

That term is overused. Man has not lived millions of years. If so where is everyone? Why are we only at barely 7 billion? Why are so few people here on Earth if humans have been here for millions of years?

&gt;So I do have an explanation for who I am, and if you can't understand that, it's likely a result of delusion or ignorance on your part. 

You have an explanation based on your belief in it. There is no solid evidence for evolution (I can only assume that is the opinion you are taking). The suppose ""evidence"" for evolution is itself based on circular reasoning so I hardly find that theory to be proof.

&gt;If anything, I want there to be a god, I really do. That would give infinity to my existence. But I can face the facts, and accept that there's no reason to believe in a god, other than to comfort myself by living in a delusion.

Do you not believe in God, or do you believe there is no God. I cant seem to distinguish from your comments which is it you are dependent on.

&gt;First off, you're assuming that I would jump to a unreasonable conclusion. 

As a normal parent might and should.

&gt;And I could get proof if I actually cared by listening, or if I really needed it, busting open the door.

Could you really? And if they were done. (Boys last milliseconds these days). What would you say then? Ask her. What if she lied? You see, this who I base everything on logic notion will ultimately be doomed to fail because, as a human, it is impossible. If everything did that, then nothing would get done because there was no proof. Because of something you couldnt see with your own two eyes.

&gt;because if I had a daughter, I wouldn't want to invade her privacy,

She has the right to have sex in your house? You must be  cool enough dad. And if she were to suddenly get preggo. I bet you'd take car of that too. Dont assume teenagers are careful with protection. If my daughter was under 18, I would oly allow it if she was out and living by herself. If she is having sec, that obviously means she is ready to start a family and wants to be responsible. As such, she would be looking for a job and an apartment to begin residing in.

"c0lq331","&gt; Where do you draw the line though?

My point is that those who get the death penalty have no legal remedies after they are dead. Others can appeal, even decades later. This is an argument often made in debates about the death penalty -- the lack of recourse.

&gt; Having someone rot in prison for 30 years is pretty damn severe.

Yes, but it's not unusual. Legal remedies can be halted on the basis that they are cruel and unusual. But they have to be both cruel *and* unusual. The death penalty has sometimes been deemed unconstitutionally cruel, but legal opinions vary over time on this issue.

&gt; Even if they are exonerated chances are their life has been permanently derailed and they'll be left working menial jobs the rest of their life.

I agree, but if they were wrongly imprisoned and their innocence is shown, they can sue the system that put them away. I am not saying this makes it all right, but it's certainly a step in the right direction:

[Texas House votes to boost compensation for wrongly imprisoned](http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/dn/dnacases/stories/DN-innocent_25tex.ART.State.Edition1.4a9c71a.html) : ""The measure would increase up-front state payments to exonerated people to $80,000 per year incarcerated, from $50,000 now.""

Better than nothing.

&gt; Nowhere in the constitution does it say or even imply that the equal protection clause might only be applied in ""severe"" cases.

I agree, I was just using ""severe"" as a measure, a threshold for legal action. Often a court wil refuse to hear a case because, as they say, *de minimis non curat lex* or  ""the law does not concern itself with trifles"".

"c0jwaej","To me, metal is an artistic movement that is defined by its spirit.  It is not, as many non-metalheads like to believe, a rejection of popular culture or conventional music, but like any true artistic movement it is an expression of beauty.  Metal does not define itself in terms of negatives, but rather in positives; not what it isn't, but what it finds beautiful.  

Metal takes that which in some circumstances would be considered harsh and chaotic and presents it in a way that is beautiful.  The ability to find beauty in chaos is the heart of what metal is, and it's the reason that I can listen to a Burzum song and find it beautiful, even though the song may be a very tortured piece.

The reason many of us react so violently to bands like Slipknot or Killswitch Engage being called metal is because they do not embody the metal spirit at all, and that spirit is something that is very important to us.  They remind me a lot of the hard rockers of the 80s and late 70s.  The bands are comprised of people that grew up worshiping the Classic Rock legends of the 60s and 70s like Jimi Hendrix and Led Zeppelin, and in trying to emulate them completely bastardized the essence of those bands and their spirit.  The people in the hard rock/hair bands/whatever you want to call it grew up wanting to rock, not create something beautiful.  That's what I think of all these bands that grew up on metal and tried but failed to be metal.  They're just rockers at heart.  They don't have anything in common with metal except that their music is heavy.  The metal scene is still very much alive today, but there was clearly a fork somewhere where one of the directions lost the spirit.

I was surprised by reddit's lack of enthusiasm for the Saga of Bloodninja.

It seems increasingly obvious that (American) morning reddit is the ""nice"" reddit, and progressively gets more mean spirited throughout the day.

6. Attempting to make a man ""fit"" to her idea of Prince Charming.

If there's one incongruity I hate about modern women its the idea that for all their progression they all now deserve a Prince to carry them off into his castle where she can start up her small business and supplement his family's endowment and rearrange all his decor.

Again, there's nothing wrong with having standards or even expecting a man to meet some of them once you're together, but a lot of women take this too far. 

They eliminate a man's say in taking care of their home, sometimes regardless of his willingness to worth with her and compromise. They attempt to eliminate long standing ""boyish"" hobbies, interests, or pursuits, and often succeeding save at those most deeply rooted. Wardrobes, diets, brand tastes, even auto preferences and political values are subject to a controlling woman's hand. 

And while all of these can actually be *good* things there is a very clear line where it stops being about the man's betterment and more about the woman's attempt to make the Prince she always wanted out of whatever spare parts are around. You can always spot the guy whose woman has emasculated his sense of identity, but whom he cares about too much to stick up for his own autonomy. 

This one is not automatically cruel, but often dependent on the man's inability to be assertive about his own life that makes it so. 

While I certainly don't wish to imply that this is all either gender's fault, I do beseech women to remember that their man can be the Prince they never knew they wanted; they just have to be willing to use a light touch and remember that both of them get to make choices. 

7. Using 'abuse' as a manipulation tool.

Now we're getting into more gender-specific territory. 

The average Woman *can* be more emotional than your average Man. 

There are so many specific examples of variance it would be insane to explain any further, but oversimplifying to a great degree this is a semi-acceptable standard. 

That said, there are women in marriages, at work, in relationships, or even just out in the world who use their natural resonance with powerful emotions to further their own gains. It's little more than an exaggerated form of the child who cries at his mother until he gets ice cream, only many women have found an ability to make this work as adults.

What makes this behavior cruel are when you factor in divorce proceedings. While men are *far* from perfect and often at legitimate fault in many divorces, the propensity of women and their attorneys to exaggerate the state of their emotional health to ""get more"" out of their husbands in terms of alimony, child support, and worst of all custody, is reprehensible. 

While this behavior often acts as a short-term gain for the woman, in the long-term this makes whatever vestiges of platonic normalcy between the man and woman toxic, reduces the man's state-of-living for decades if not the remainder of his life, and worst of all creates a state in which the children are even *more* disconnected from male role models in their life. 

And that's not even including the spectre of potential physical abuse, which if none occurred can make an innocent man a pariah from men and women alike simply because of what was alleged. 

8. Using pregnancy as a manipulation device.

If sex is the most wonderful thing a man and a woman can do to reaffirm their innate masculine and feminine values (and for homosexual relationships just substitute man and woman with whatever and whatever and leaves the next part out of your mind), then pregnancy is the joyous fruit of that reaffirmation. The man proves his virility and the woman proves her capacity as a nurturer of life, and both are rewarded with a charge that validates one of their deepest natural biological instincts. 

Women who use pregnancy as *any* sort of manipulation tool are truly horrible people.

False pregnancy scares are insanely disconcerting to a man and can take him on a truly devastating emotional roller coaster often causing real social damage. 

Using a pregnancy to either 'put the fear of god into' or 'keep around' a man is a sign of extreme emotional immaturity. 

Then there are those women who would forget to use birth control or even sperm-jack a man to *really* get pregnant.

Because of parenting laws the woman gets to unilaterally affect a man's life for a minimum of 18 years. Any woman who does this to keep a man around, or even worse to spite him, has done nothing but created a toxic environment for the three of them *AND* put serious damage on the child. 

The worst part of this cruelty is that it is legally sanctioned to bind the man to the child as long as the woman wants to keep said child, making this one of the cruelest things a woman could do, but it's not the most cruel. 

9. Using Rape as a manipulation device.

Now we're in heavy territory.

Rape is a horrible facet of human existence. It perverts sex and humiliates both genders. You don't need to watch a Lifetime movie to approximate the right emotion reserved for rapists, though doing so helps. 

Any woman who claims a man raped her when such is not actually the case is doing something *even worse* than lying about pregnancy. You see, children can grow up and leave and men can resume some semblance of independence. Alleged rapists have those two words ""alleged"" and ""rapist"" haunt them forever.

Sometimes sex isn't always a good idea. Sometimes a relationship ends very badly and the man was a cheating little weasel. Sometimes the divorce attorneys just can't buy that a man with no history of major temper was emotionally or physically abusive to her. 

If rape is even considered by a woman as a weapon, then they are making a cruel mockery or every rape victim male and female alike and are awful human beings. 

Alleging rape is cruel enough to ruin a man's life, haunting his reputation and ruining his ability to work and interact in many environments, but it's not even the worst.

10. Using accusatory pedophilia.

See, I told you this last one was gender-neutral, because men can lobby it against women too. But there is a specific wrinkle about women doing this to men that also applies to 9 and 7 on this list.

You see, pedophilia is even worse than ""ordinary"" rape because ""ordinary"" implies some loss of innocence prior. Pedophilia involves taking an implicit trust between adult and child and violating it and forever damaging the child's life.

This is truly the neutron bomb in the nuclear arsenal of social weapons women can lobby against men. You see, alleging abuse or rape may destroy a man's reputation and irradiate his social life for decades, but there is a chance that through all the cancerous ostracism he will eventually find his life arable again.

If you use pedophilia against a man and even half-succeed his social reputation is irrevocably altered. He will put put on databases as a person of interest, if *nothing* else and be forever monitored. He will likely have to move far away and pray that no one from his past is vindictive enough to bring the gossip to him. If his profession involved children in even the most remote of capacities he will be blacklisted and have to change careers. 

Because women are often considered by the courts as slightly more vulnerable than men--a poor side effect of warped feminism--men who receive this allegation will spend the rest of their lives being considered guilty until proven innocent. Women, while almost equally screwed, will be given some benefit of doubt; perhaps nothing more than an infinitesimal benefit of doubt, but more than men.

"c0djxtk","(for the spectators, preface all of this with ""this is what I believe personally; I'm not telling you you have to agree, that's not my place)

This (why not all are saved) is a problem that has primarily arisen from the Presbyterian concept of predestination; that everyone's salvation was determined without regard to their own choice; that the saved are ""God's elect."" I don't accept that. I've had arguments with people about this in the past, and have never been convinced that it's a Biblical concept. It's from a very loose interpretation of a few passages (Romans 8:29, primarily), that can be interpreted in other ways that don't contradict other passages.

Salvation is only possible through Christ, but we do have a say in it. Throughout the Gospels, Christ asks people to follow him, come with him, etc. They are given the choice, and many refuse the choice. 

There was a story a while back about a woman in a car crash; she had gotten mad and rammed the back of a parked car. She continued to gun the engine, even though she was stuck. The spinning tires caught fire from the friction. People ran up to her and tried to warn her, but she wouldn't listen, wouldn't even unlock the door. One guy broke her window and tried to drag her off, but she screamed at him and beat at him, even bit his hand IIRC. The car caught fire and she died. 

Who's fault was it that she died? People tried to save her, but she wouldn't listen. Not only did she not listen to their warnings, she aggressively beat them away. Should they have incapacitated her and dragged her from the car to safety?

I see this as an analogy for Christianity. God tries to save us, but he can't or won't just force it on us. That would be an invalidation of free will, and would diminish the relationship there.

I base this on a few verses like 1 Timothy 2:1-4:

&gt; ""I urge, then, first of all, that requests, prayers, intercession and thanksgiving be made for everyone— for kings and all those in authority, that we may live peaceful and quiet lives in all godliness and holiness. This is good, and pleases God our Savior, *who wants all men to be saved* and to come to a knowledge of the truth""

IOW, God wants everyone to be saved. However, not everyone is saved. Therefore, there must be something preventing that. Either God can't save us on His own, or it would violate something important to the point that he won't.

Note that this is a use of the same ""all"" that I alluded to before (even in the ""everyone"" line), but I think the context implies a broadest application of ""all"".

First of all , after being convicted of his far left terrorist activities , he never served his full 14 years after securing the help of lawyer one Gerhard Schroder none the less . He was required ( and did )  renounce terrorist activities and methods  . However by 1997 he is talking about Germany being enslaved , world Jewry and control , well generally unpleasant stuff which can be accessed on the net .

He starts talking of holocaust denial which the German's are touchy about for some reason and regard as a hate crime as it is directed at specific groups . For him , and other deniers , it is a Jewish lie/propaganda weapon they use to control.

In 2003 he states the 9/11 attacks were a conspiracy and ""it is not true that al-Qaeda had anything to do with it."". In 2001 nine days after the attacks he said they were cruel but justified attacks and he gave his full sympathy to the attackers  , thus he was accused of condoning an illegal act.

In 2007 he greets Jewish Michel Friedman  at the beginning of an interview for Vanity Fair with a nazi salute and ""Heil Hitler, Herr Friedman!"" . In the interview he states ""the systematic extermination of Jews in Auschwitz is a lie,"" and Adolf Hitler was ""the savior of the German people [but] not only of the German people"" .

Later that year , he gets six months for performing an ""ironic"" nazi salute when reporting to prison for a nine-month term a year earlier.

Then comes the 2009 trial . How did that start? He filed a complaint against himself . It's almost as if the man wanted attention for his odious and inciteful words . And how did he end his trial ( he's a lawyer by the way )? He gives a closing speech of an hour repeating his denial of holocaust  , talk of Jewish bankers and warning people are getting angry against the Jews. Judge Martin Rieder thought him completely unrepentant and totally unteachable.""It was as if these people have had to die again,"" Rieder said. ""Therefore, the Horst Mahler show has now ended,"" He declared that he as a judge should stop the ""nationalist rattle"" and ""nonsense spread"" .

&gt;In time, the Deity perceived that death was a mistake; a mistake, in that it was insufficient; insufficient, for the reason that while it was an admirable agent for the inflicting of misery upon the survivor, it allowed the dead person himself to escape from all further persecution in the blessed refuge of the grave. This was not satisfactory. A way must be conceived to pursue the dead beyond the tomb.

&gt;The Deity pondered this matter during four thousand years unsuccessfully, but as soon as he came down to earth and became a Christian his mind cleared and he knew what to do. He invented hell, and proclaimed it.

&gt;Now here is a curious thing. It is believed by everybody that while he was in heaven he was stern, hard, resentful, jealous, and cruel; but that when he came down to earth and assumed the name Jesus Christ, he became the opposite of what he was before: that is to say, he became sweet, and gentle, merciful, forgiving, and all harshness disappeared from his nature and a deep and yearning love for his poor human children took its place.

"c08t3dt","*lets assume that this dramatized version of evolution is accurate. There is still no way to infer purpose from it, because it is just a natural process.*

Just because it is natural doesn't mean there isn't a purpose. When a tree drops fruit, the purpose is for you to eat it and poop out the seeds. If you don't do it, that tree won't breeds and if nobody did it, the tree would die our ot evolve in some other way.

Evolution is a process, but it has goals like any other which if aren't met derails the process. If humans all failed to fuck, we would cease to exist therefor we MUST fuck and MUST die, or the species wouldn't exist. That's a purpose in my book.

The sun is a little different - it just happens to be there and our processes evolved around it. We didn't create it for our needs but evolution did create your penis for it's own needs. Without breeding, all life stops and nature has made it impossible for life to stop. Man can do nothing to stop evolution and fucking, it is beyond our control.

*There is nothing stopping people from creating a meaning and purpose for things. In fact, it is something we do on a day to day basis and it is critical to the way we make sense of the world.*

Anything you make up is in your head, and when you die will die with you, so is ultimately pointless. As long as you breed nature doesnt care and if youd ont breed, you ideas die with you like everything else. It's a very cruel but efficient process like life itself.

Don't kid yourself though, pretending life has a purpose is like being religious - you are just making shit up to make yourself feel better about the inherent meaninglessness of life and thats it. There is no difference between going to church and trying to think you have a purpose in life as both are false constructs of a feeble mind trying to justify it's existence so it doesn't feel it is pointless.

Seriously, try living a week and feeling pointless. You won't get far, people can't live without the lies. We have to make up an excuse to live or we'd all top ourselves - yet again, evolution keeps us going. If we did all top ourselves, evolution couldn't happen so we are designed to lie so we can keep doing the job of fucking and dying.

*For example, there is no natural reason that a computer is a computer. It is only due to the way that humans perceive, use and design computers that they have that particular meaning for us. There is nothing inherent in the material existence of a computer that gives it a meaningful or purposeful identity.*

I agree. Your point?

*Even if you stick to the idea that humans can't create meaning or purpose, or that the purpose or meaning of human life has already been decided by natural forces, why stick to generalizations of certain evolutionary processes and ignore all the other natural forces that lead to the existence of human beings?*

Evolution is the only natural force that created us. We only exist because of it and for no other reason.

"c080l9v","I agree you have power over your parrot. But you do not have absolute power over your parrot. You do not even come close to having absolute power over your parrot. You do not know that he will fly if you throw him. You do not know he will fly when he is eating a treat. You do not *know* he will fly when your wife comes home. Yes you can predict that and it will likely do as you say. You can cause actions by producing certain stimuli but these stimuli only have a probability of getting a response based on past experience. It may be a good probability, but it is a probability and therefore has a small chance of not happening. 

You could cut off his wings and say he will never fly again. While this would be true, and pretty cruel but I doubt you would do that, you cannot prevent him from thinking of flying. You cannot prevent him from thinking of eating, thinking of drinking, or thinking of anything really. Even if a machine was invented so that you could alter the minds of your pet you still would not have *absolute* power over them. You do not have absolute power over a being until you control every aspect of them. Lets say you are in the future with your future parrot and your future wife. In this future they have the technology to control you pets thoughts, needs, wants, physical appearance, etc. Essentially you do have near absolute power over your parrot. You could make it think its hungry. You could change it to a glowing sulphourous yellow. You could make it act like a dog. You could make it look like a dog. Does your parrot have free will now? 

When you are able to control the thoughts of a being, the appearance of a being, and the actions of a being, does that being have free will? Any will at all?

The answer is, of course, yes. That being would have free will. Just because you could do something doesn’t mean you would. This logic, however, does not work with an *omniscient* god. The question is not do you have the power to do something but rather do you have the exact knowledge to say what a being will or will not be doing next. If something knows what you will be doing next, exactly, and is correct perfectly without any doubt then you have already done it in that something’s eyes.

Apologies for the long posts but this sort of thing needs writing in detail.

"c07xc5v","It's really wonderful that you gave her that response, and you're right - a person should never rush to categorize themselves (even as ""straight""). However, do not let that keep you from supporting the self-identification she embraces. If she identifies as a lesbian, that's great. And if, next year, she identifies as bisexual, straight, transgender, polish, or muslim - all of those are great too. As long as she is exploring her self-identity in a genuine way, don't let you caution about categorization keep you from supporting her as clearly and openly as you can. The more support you give her, the healthier will be her self-image and self-understanding. I just want to emphasize that.

Now, to answer your actual question - I came out at 13 as well, and it was a very difficult time. A big part of that was my parents. I ended up spending a few months without a home, and then living with my sister. It sounds like this won't be her problem - thank god. The second part were the kids in school. They were hateful and cruel, BUT - and this is a big but - kids are hateful and cruel to anyone who isn't ""like them"" enough. Your love and support will help her overcome that, and chances are she will grow up to be a strong, confident, well-adjusted woman.

I don't know what resources are available in your area, but I would suggest visiting an LGBT-oriented community center. Here in Chicago, one such place is the ""Center on Halsted,"" where a number of programs are open to queer youth. Even consider attending a program like this, or a PFLAG (""Parents and Friends of Lesbians And Gays"") event. If you go to such an event with your daughter, it will serve the dual purpose of showing her your love and support *and* helping you to understand issues that are relevant to her. Again, depending on where you live, there may be more or fewer programs available. If you are fortunate enough to live near a diverse metropolitan area, you might look for programs that are relevant to your daughter in ways that include her queer identity, but don't limit themselves to that. E.g. many communities have vibrant black lesbian communities, or lesbian athletes, lesbian reading circles, lesbian gamers (video games), etc. Any way that you can engage different pieces of your daughter's maturing identity, in ways that include her lesbian identity, will be positive both for her and you.

If you have any specific questions, ask them. I'm sure the people here on reddit will offer any advice/experience/help they can.

"c078pqr","I am familiar with Michael Levin's essay.  It raises some interesting points.  It says that torture may be morally permissible because we admire other things that are more atrocious as a society. I'm afraid, however, that it doesn't stand up to my idea of morality. Some of the things that he mentions, like cutting off gangrene, or the caning of criminals before there was a prison system, are done for the greater good. Gangrene, unchecked, will kill a man, and we assume that he wants to live. Caning provided punishment and a moral deterrent to the criminally inclined.  

Some of the other things that he mentioned, however, are not obviously necessary and thus not obviously moral. Many say that the war in Iraq is immoral, because it didn't follow international protocol and Saddam Hussein did not present an imminent threat to the United States. Likewise, Harry Truman's dropping of the atomic bombs becomes morally questionable when it becomes known that he knew that the Japanese were on the verge of collapse anyway.

And even if you accepted *all* of this as moral, it still doesn't answer the pertinent question for me: does torture have a reasonable expectation of getting you what you want, assuming that what you want is timely information, and not just a confession under duress? I think that the answer to that is **no**. That's what has not been convincing for me in all these arguments, and what allows me to continue to say that torture is immoral in all cases. 

I don't oppose this out of some twisted issue of human rights (although I do think that human rights are important). It's that I think that if you're going to do something like this, the positives have to outweigh the negatives. And I still fail to see much positive: the person that you're torturing still has free will. If he wants to hurt you by withholding information, he will. There are some people that you will never break. So the potential for positive outcomes in this situation is low. But there seems to be no end to the negatives: all the things that I've listed above, plus that you feel even more helpless in the end. I'd rather take the hit than to gamble that my enemy is more mentally weak than I am, because if I lose, I come out not only looking cruel, but also foolish for thinking that I could break him.

"c073jkl","&gt;You seemed stuck in a paradigm where incentives, good or bad, are the only thing that matter.

No - I pointed out they don't mean much for highly functioning individuals. But all that stands between a lazy lowlife and a criminal is fear of punishment etc. etc. 

&gt;People don't want jobs, they want income!

Doesn't matter much what they want. Work, even tedious, shitty work is ennobling even when people don't want to do it. OK this is something that's hard to prove in a fairly short comment. But shortly, part of it is focusing on something other than our whining egos and part of it is the self-esteem gained from doing something well. It has little to do what people want. When I was a child, I always hated when my parents made me clean up my room. But when I finished it I felt good about it and not just because of pleasing the parents. I can't really explain why. It seems there is some intrinsic satisfaction to be gained from such things, but that does not make you want to do them, this is why incentives for these things are useful, again, obviously not useful for higher level works. Virtue is rewarding, but only in the long run, and thus time-preference plays a role etc.

I'd suggest to read The Unholy City Revisited from Edward C. Banfield. He is a reactionary prick like me, yes :) but a capable, empirical sociologist. Not make-believe sociology, but hard data. Anyway, his main observation is that the main difference between people is future-orientedness (that which the economists call time preference). If the future does not count much for a person, then come booze, drugs, impulse-crime, debt, violence, all that shit. When it counts people try to live healthy, invest into themselves i.e. study, not get deep into debt, behave in a way that won't get them into jail and so on. (I suspect America was very future-oriented in the past and became very present-oriented now, even more than Europe. OTOH I've never been there, jus from what I read.) 

So anyway, basically at least half of what I babble about virtues is low time preference, not discounting the future much, caring about what happens to you in 10-20-30 years, being able to control your impulses, and so on. If a society is to be designed - which I doubt but anyway - it is to be mainly designed around this.

&gt;You need to enrich your worldview with new ideas, new distinctions.

Actually I want to, but the problem is most progressive ideologues just dismiss these old prejudices gained from personal and historical experience instead of thoroughly explaining what's wrong with them. They seem to sorely missing life experience (i.e. dealing with lots of shit) and a healthy humility towards historical experience i.e. old prejudices, traditions. Which can be challenged, even maybe should be, but challenged as taking them seriously, giving them a good, deep looking into, not just dismissing them. 

Could be my bad though, because whenever I read progressives to enrich my conservative worldview they tend to be the mild liberals (the two Galbraiths etc.) rather than real radicals, obviously, it's a bit lazy thing to do on my part. 

&gt;If you want to know, synthetics should be first class citizens in all positions of power and leadership.

Well at least you are not a democratic statist. (Democratic statism is a huge cognitive dissonance: before the election, the people are assumed to know what's best for them but after the election it is assumed they don't. Really weird.)

&gt;Magical thinkers are guaranteed evil if only because assaulting logic is evil.

No. Very often bad logic is more useful than none. Example magical thinking (associative rather than causal thinking): genocide is bad because Hitler did it and he was a bad person. This is as asinine logic as it can get, getting the causal relationship totally the other way around. Still, such magical thinker loosely associates ideas like ""Hitler"" and ""genocide"" and labels them all evil, which is a MUCH better thing to do than to have no opionon about it at all. Or think about a conservative religious person of the simplest kind in around 1910 : ""Racism is bad because it's Darwinist and my pastor says Darwin was a Satanist."" The logic is as bad as it can be, but still the outcome, the result is better than the result of many bright pseudo-scientific eugenists of that age. Bad method, but good result, while in the later case bad result, with good method. 

&gt;Farmers farm, that's just what they do. Even at a loss.

Good point - habits are important, most of what we are is habits. But do something 1000 times and it becomes a habit, it becomes YOU. But  change does happen and way or another something incentives it, maybe not money, just some necessity or a better way or anything...

&gt;Money doesn't motivate anyone, it merely ALLOWS things to happen.

I did read up on extrinsic vs. intrinsic motivation a while ago and basically what they say is that money is a bad motivation to creative or moral work etc. but a good motivation to make a salesman sell many cars or a factory worker put in overtime if there is an urgent sales ordeer to be fulfilled. Which is exactly what is usually done. Money does not motivate everybody all the time but does motivate a lot of people in many of the cases. People want more children therefore a bigger home, therefore a willing to go to a course to learn a more intelligent job that pays better etc.

&gt;So you see, manipulating people using money is so fucking crude. It's right up there with shackling them in irons and whipping them.

It's all about the level. Irons and whips were a cruel, but efficient way to motivate people not to commit crimes, i.e. a very low-level thing. Money is a good motivator to clean some fucking toilets, which is a bit higher level thing. Attention, praise, recognition are better motivators on a higher level, idealism (work that truly benefits others) or curiosity are better motivators on an even higher level etc. etc. Of course it would be the highest level of stupidity to pay f.e. programmers on the basis of number of bugs fixed / week. But OTOH number of toilets cleaned / week isn't a bad basis of a wage.

"c068wv7","Cost effective?  Not a chance.  Some of my neighbors have chickens that are completely free range.  They throw out food scraps once in a while, but mainly the chickens forage for their food.  If you can go that route, you might save money, assuming you didn't spend any building a coop (the materials for mine cost a few hundred dollars).

If you keep them in a coop and feed them, you will spend more on feed than you would buying eggs.  Commercial egg-layers are not allowed to move around, so all of their energy goes to egg production.  It's cruel, but efficient.  You will also lack the scale to make it efficient.

I keep chickens in my back yard in a coop that I built.  I think it is worthwhile for a few reasons:

1. Chickens are fun to have.  They are entertaining to watch and my kids love them.
2. My chickens are happy and well cared for.  That doesn't make the eggs taste better, but it makes me feel better.
3. My chickens range around eating grass and bugs as well as the feed that I give them.  The eggs are higher quality, with a better taste and a yellower yolk.

You'd have to eat a lot of eggs to amortize the cost of building the coup (plus the opportunity cost for the time you use caring for them), and your puny buying power means that you will overpay for feed.

Regarding the smell: my chickens don't stink.  I don't know if that is because I let them roam around most of the time (I have a 1 acre lot), but they have always smelled pretty neutral.  Someone gave us a rooster that smelled bad, but after living with us for a while, the smell went away.  I live in a dry climate, which means the poop dries out quickly and doesn't stink.

I seem to be rambling now, so I'll summarize:

If you want to save money, raising chickens is probably the wrong way to do it.  Spend the few hours you would building a coop on a programming contract and you'll pay for more eggs than you can ever eat.  Raising your own is usually an expense, not a savings.

If you want to raise chickens and like high-quality eggs or you care about animal welfare, then it is worth it.  Chickens are pretty low maintenance, cheap to buy, easy to raise, and fun to have.

"c050hxt","Nobody wants to tell the truth about the problem.  Black people themselves only blame ""the man"" for their woes, and guilty whites certainly aren't speaking up.  I should know, I'm one of those guilty whites, but at least I'm trying to mend my ways and face facts.  Other more successful minorities don't say anything as they don't want to rock the boat.

Blacks are *7 times* more likely to commit homicide than whites.  Don't take my word for it, ask the government.

http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/homicide/race.htm  

This becomes an even more shocking statistic when you realize that blacks are only *12 percent* of the U.S. population.

http://nces.ed.gov/pubs2007/minoritytrends/ind_1_1.asp  

Look at Africa.  Look at any all black or mostly black neighborhood.  Black people as a whole are not really interested in working hard to get an education or advance civilization.  The majority of wealthy (more than $400K/yr income) blacks are musicians, actors, or sports figures - not business men or people providing tangible value to society.  It is considered noteworthy or remarkable when a black man becomes a stockbroker, scientist, or something similar.  You can blame racism for this, but Jews and other minorities have faced similar hatred and ostracization but still have managed to rise above their circumstances to become better than the labels they were given.  

I'm not sure if this solution has a problem.  The deviation between white and black IQ's are startling -- many academics have been perplexed and worried about it for decades with minimal change.  Here is an example:

http://www.aei.org/events/eventID.1425,filter.all,type.upcoming/event_detail.asp

More entitlements, affirmative action, shaming and all the usual tricks have not helped black people as a whole advance.  ""Successful"", non-criminal black males are an anomaly, and are usually held in high regard due to their rarity.

Bill Cosby certainly said it better than I ever could:

http://www.eightcitiesmap.com/transcript_bc.htm 

It makes me sad that I have to avoid black neighborhoods because I'm afraid of them, and that the average black person's speech is so riddled with slang and patois that they are difficult to communicate with.  Generally when I see any gathering of black people, I know there will be violence involved.  When I see a shooting or some other type of general mayhem, I generally assume the perpetrator is black, and 8 out of 10 times I'm right.  This is not confirmation bias at work.

You may call me racist for pointing out the truth, so be it.  This may sound cruel, but black people need to start owning up to their problems and change -- if they can't join civilized society then we should lock them up and throw away the key.  For those that downmod me for telling the truth, you are part of the problem.  I promise I'll change my mind when the statistics and the reality changes.

I could use the stale, cheesy line that ""some of my best friends are black"" and some of them are.

"c02bw55","   Unsurprisingly that Wikipedia account is quite misleading.   

The big problem with the list is that it appears to have been an uncritical regurgitation of Athenaeus without looking at other sources that are more reliable.  Athenaeus has a huge chip on his shoulder about Plato, and slagged him whenever he could, but when other sources are taken into account it's clear that he was not especially reliable (though he is the only source for accounts of some figures, so he's still very significant).  He wrote many hundreds of years after the events he describes, and had an agenda which compromised his integrity.  Thus there are also some very misleading figures in the list:

Clearchus of Heracleia left Plato to become a student of Isocrates, the anti-Plato, and then went on to seize rule of Heracleia.  He was murderous and cruel, but his form of rule was certainly nothing like the metaphor in the Republic.  You can read up on him in Memnon to see this.

The story of Kallippos and the situation with Syracuse is much more complex than any brief account can suggest, but the short of it is that Plato was trying to prevent a tyranny there in Syracuse, not sponsor one.  

From what we know through Diogenes Laertius (as opposed to Athenaeus), while Hermias of Atarneus was a basileus, he was certainly not a tyrant in the modern sense of the term.  He was actually well regarded as a leader.

So you should take that list with a grain of salt.  Plato did have some former pupils at the Academy who went on to become tyrants, but given that Plato was running the first institution of higher learning which drew many and various figures it's no surprise that they had many and various careers.  Plato did say that he had tried to make some kings more philosophical (as opposed to making philosopher-kings), but that meant trying to persuade them to cultivate moderation, honesty, sincerity, to be introspective, and to not look on a life of pleasure or a life seeking wealth as the fundamental good.  That agenda was obviously abandoned by those who went on to be tyrants.

&gt;Let me say that I very much disagree with the above paragraph on the notion that those people ""did not impose anything like a philosopher-kingship"". To the contrary I'd bet they followed Plato's ideas to the letter.

What historical sources do you derive those views from?  I think that if you took a more scientific approach to historiography you'd find that your hypothesis was very poorly supported, esp. with only the unreliable Athenaeus to back it up.

I'd say one obvious counter-argument to the idea that there were tyrants who attempted to create states following a constitution modeled on taking Plato's Republic literally is that when Aristotle enumerated the various forms of constitutions of the Greek states that existed, he did not mention any state that followed an attempt at realizing Plato's metaphor.  And certainly Aristotle was always happy to slag Plato then given the opportunity.

&gt;Would you want to live in a state portrayed in The Republic?

Now that depends.  If you mean it as Plato intends it, then as a metaphor it doesn't really sound all that bad it essentially sounds like Advaita Vedanta or Buddhism.  The account of training the guardians is a metaphorical account of a kind of set of mental practices akin to a kind of Yoga.  It's not everyone's kind of thing but I can think of many much worse kinds of things to be into.

On the other hand if you mean to take it as a literal state, then of course nobody would want to live there, not even a person who was in a privileged position (since they gain nothing from rule other than responsibility) though Plato himself pointed out that the state was only a metaphor to understand justice in the individual to show that the individual should choose justice as a good in itself.  

Do you think that Plato regarded all people as literally residing in a cave watching shadows cast before them on a wall, or that each person sailed along in a literal chariot with a light and dark horse where the light horse would eventually sprout wings?   Taking the Polis described literally is to completely miss the point of the book, and intentionally ignore both the stated purpose of the work, and the fact that Soc. says plainly that no philosopher would ever attempt to create such a state literally or participate in such a state if others tried to create one. 

&gt;If there is a guide to how not to create an equitable state then The Republic is it.

Yes, it's not a guide to creating an equitable state.  If read it carefully, it's clear that isn't intended as such.  Many scholars have followed poor commentaries that mistake it as a political work, which is very sad, but if you ignore the commentaries and actually read the book you can't justify the position that it's a political work - you need to selectively ignore passages (and overarching themes), and read a lot into the work as well.

"c20hzw","I fail to see how rape or slavery could do anything to lower populations, therefore your strawman utterly fails.  I suppose you could call it rationalization, but the fact is infanticide is the product of evolution in a difficult environment.  Nearly every primitive culture practiced(s) it in some form or another.  While it doesn't jive so well with our current culture, we don't have the same pressures as these people.  Think of the horrible burden a crippled or deformed child would be on these people, for one thing.  Also, remember these people don't have access to abortion clinics or pre-natal screening which would enable the detection of disabled children before birth (which are frequently aborted here).  Unless you are strict pro-life, then you are simply projecting your cultural context onto a completely alien environment.

The Brazilian policy of respect for indigenous beliefs is a very new one (since the late 80's).  Before that they actively practiced ""assimilation"" which basically amounted to the enslavement of the natives and complete denigration of their culture.  We can't pick and choose what aspects of their culture to respect.  They are, for all intents and purposes, completely autonomous now, and we have no more right to tell them what ancient laws they must discard than the Iranian Imam does to tell us we must convert our country to a strict Islamic theocracy.
